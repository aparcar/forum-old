					<p>Hello,<br />I have a WNDRMACv2 with Netgear firmware 1.0.0.22 (latest version):</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Hardware Version&nbsp; &nbsp; WNDRMAC</p><p>Firmware Version&nbsp; &nbsp; V1.0.0.22</p><p>GUI Language Version&nbsp; &nbsp; V1.0.0.91</p></blockquote></div><p>I tried to upload the firmware 15.05.1 from the GUI, no success: the message tells me that I uploaded OpenWRT but I have 1.0.0.22 installed.<br />I tried to replace (with a binary editor) the beginning of the firmware (up to &quot;sqsh&quot;) with the header found in 1.0.0.22, and the upload process goes on, but then it does not get updated because it is damaged or similar.<br />I loaded firmware 1.0.0.18 and tried the same, no success.</p><p>I tried to set my network card to 192.168.1.5, reboot the router with &quot;reset&quot; pressed, keeping it until the power LED blinks green, then I released the reset and I uploaded the firmware (factory.img) with the tftp utility from the Netgear website, or also using tftp from the command line in W10. In both cases the upload works (the green LED turns off and doesn&#039;t blink during the 2-3 seconds of the upload), but then it continues blinking. I waited for over 15 minutes and still blinks.<br />Rebooting, the firmware is still 1.0.0.22.</p><p>Why is my WNDRMAC not accepting the firmware both with GUI or with tftp?</p><p>What else could I try?</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>My mistake was in thinking the device was a v2, just because in the WNDRMAC Wiki page it&#039;s written that 16+64 MB were only in v2.<br />In fact, I have a v1 (also notice the firmware 1.0.0.22: Netgear associates that with v1).</p><p>It worked directly from the GUI by using the firmware from the thread &quot;Optimized and feature rich trunk build for select routers&quot; built specifically for WNDRMAC(v1).</p>									</div>
