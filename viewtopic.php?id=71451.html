					<p>Hi,</p><p>Just wondering if anyone has flashed OpenWrt onto a FileHub Plus (RP-WD03) before? I noticed someone did it with a RP-WD02, however that looked a bit dodgy. Not to mention it seems to be a little outdated and the RP-WD03 is different (I would assume, looking under the bonnet).</p><p>Any ideas would be helpful.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
