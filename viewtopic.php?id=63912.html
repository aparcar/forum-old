					<p>Hi Guys,</p><p>First - I am newby to OpenWRT (before I was using CISCO, DrayTek and DD-WRT)..</p><p>I have a question as cannot find right samples or docs online. I have Linksys WRT 1900ACS router. Installed latest stable release of OpenWRT (15/03/2016). Now I am looking at GUI and non-GUI configurations + trying follow wiki documentations, but I can find only basics. But what I need - I want to create different VLANs per LAN interfaces so for example:</p><p>Router port 1 = vlan1;<br />Router port 2 = vlan2;<br />Router port 3,4 - vlan3;<br />Router Wi-Fi = vlan4;</p><p>By default after&nbsp; flashed firmware I can see lan interfaces and wifi interfaces come as &quot;lan-bridge&quot;. I was playing with GUI and was trying to create some switch0, but it was continuesly locking me down and hard reset was required.</p><p>Can somebody post/share sample config for /etc/config/network file? or advise how can I achieve this?<br />swconfig shows following: ports: 7, CPU @ 5, VLANS 64.</p><p>For info: I cannot use &quot;luci&quot; - because switch or vlan options not even listed, which is very strange..<br />On &quot;luci&quot; wiki - I have seen that config switch0 needs to be added first in /etc/config/network for this option to appear in GUI, but my test was not success.. so asking you guys, perhaps you will have a better idea</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tomce</strong> on 4 Apr 2016, 23:42)</p>

					<p>Have you tried using LuCI to set this up? I have a router setup with 2 VLANs (on separate ports) using LuCI. It wasn&#039;t that hard. </p><p>The trickiest part will be to not cut yourself off by reconfiguring the switch. I suggest you attach to VLAN 1 (the default) on port 1, and reconfigure the rest of the router from there.</p><p>HTH</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Thanks for reply! Problem is that there is no switch or vlan options in &quot;luci&quot; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> But I have seen some print screens on the forum that some people do have such option.. I have tried trunk and stable - same thing..</p><p>If I would see in &quot;luci&quot; - I would be on half way solving this problem <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> heh <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Community is friendly, but wiki is very small for my router, not much samples or config explanations.</p><p>I am Linux user, so shell commands not a problem for me, problem that every-time I am trying something - I am getting disconnected..&nbsp; I have created script and cron job which reverts my /etc/config/firewall to default state so I don&#039;t need to revert my router manually.. I don&#039;t want to &quot;open box&quot; yet, as I may return router if my testing will not succeed within next few days. </p><p>Should be easy thing &quot;vlans&quot;, why openwrt made it so complicated <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I have posted my problem in other forums too:<br /><a href="http://superuser.com/questions/1061327/how-to-setup-vlans-per-interfaces-on-linksys-wrt-1900-acs-openwrt-chaos-calmer">http://superuser.com/questions/1061327/ â€¦ aos-calmer</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tomce</strong> on 4 Apr 2016, 23:37)</p>

					<p>I have returned unit back as no info and as I understood switch isn&#039;t properly supported yet. Shame as it was great hardware - quality one! Rapid and powerful too. May buy again if OpenWRT will release greater support in the future.. As for now - anybody can advise for well supported hardware? (I am talking here about premium with ac and dual band). I don&#039;t like TP link ones.. Cheap plastic units (Others may think differently), that is my opinion</p>									</div>
