					<p>Got the TP-MR3040 today from amazom and in under 10mins i have probably bricked it </p><p>To all the gurus out there and TP-MR3040 owners...help pls</p><p>In my haste to install openwrt on it, i mistakenly flashed a bin for the asus WL-330n3g instead of the bin for a TP-MR3040 <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>Now all i get when i turn it on, is a flash of all the four green lights and then the power light stays on permanently, i now have no access to ethernet configuration, as i dont get an ip address from the router anymore.</p><p>Anything i can do without having to go the serial port way, as i currently dont have the needed cables or even a soldering iron.</p><p>I have tried to get to failsafe (stated here - <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-mr3420#failsafe">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-mr3420#failsafe</a> or here - <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe)">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe)</a> but that doesnt seem to work, still no ip or anything <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>So have i bricked it? ...any comment or advice will be welcome guys</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>des245</strong> on 12 Apr 2013, 19:12)</p>

					<p>same thing here... somehow the part about &quot;writing the firmware to the device&quot; didn&#039;t work well.<br />Everything looks great... exept... I am NOT able to logon to the device or even give a new password.<br />I am able to access the 192.168.1.1 website where it shows already &quot;root&quot; - but like I said... password is unknown.<br />Neither &quot;passwd&quot; - &quot;admin&quot; - &quot;root&quot; is working <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>I thought doing the FailSafe Mode....would help...but here I have:<br />root@(none):/#<br />and when I go for &quot;passwd&quot; ...after retyping the new password it says:<br />&quot;passwd: /etc/passwd: Read-only file system<br />passwd: can&#039;t update password file /etc/passwd&quot;..... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" />/</p><p>any ideas?

Or how can I fix that jffs2 partition?<br />I am kinda sooo lost.... and Windows User .. so sorry for asking basic questions here...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>markusharea-0</strong> on 31 May 2014, 19:03)</p>
