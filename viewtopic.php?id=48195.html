					<p>Hello,</p><p>I got here a TP-Link TL-WR1043ND flashed with &quot;openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr1043nd-v1-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin&quot;.<br />What im trying to do is setting up the following:<br />Internet connected with the router via WAN Port (DHCP) and three Vlans.</p><p>- First VLAN should have port 1 and 2 and IP 10.11.19.1<br />- Second VLAN port 3 and IP 10.11.19.3<br />- and third VLAN port 4 and IP 10.11.19.3.</p><p>I tried setting it up with Luci but every time I changed any VLAN Setting my WAN port stopped working, and so i have no internet connection. Now im trying setting it up without Luci, but even if i just change the vlan settings in &quot;etc/config/network&quot; like this:</p><p>config switch_vlan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;switch0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ports &#039;1 4 5t&#039;</p><p>config switch_vlan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;switch0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan &#039;2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ports &#039;3 5t&#039;</p><p>my WAN port stopped working...</p><p>Why does this happens? How do I Set it up the right way?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vupibi</strong> on 4 Jan 2014, 17:50)</p>

					<p>port 0 seems to be missing, that&#039;s tied to the wan port<br />If you didn&#039;t change any other settings, lan3 /switch port 3 is now your wan since the default wan inteface for this router uses eth0.2</p>									</div>
