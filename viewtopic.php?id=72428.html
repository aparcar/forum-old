					<p>Hey</p><p>I found out i wanted to open my router just to add some antennas and i found some funny things :stuck_out_tongue:</p><p>The backside (the side you see then you open the router) was kind of boring ibb.co/jRqzwR</p><p>But the front side have “a lot” of “goodies”.</p><p>Here is the hole board. At the top You se Jtag and UART, and yes its market as just that Jtag and Uart, i have not test them yet because i found some more interesting :smiley:<br />ibb.co/h1Txi6</p><p>3 unused antenna ports, that works (i think) the antenna signal gets stronger if i add a antenna on it and bad if i take it away (tested all 3 and disconnected the other ones). And it also a extra 5g antenna on the board if you dont have enough external antennas at the moment :stuck_out_tongue:<br />ibb.co/eM3xi6</p><p>Adding the connecters to the point is kind of hard, much easier to just strip the cable and add it to the board.<br />And here it is lol with 7 antenna ports ibb.co/hRHMbR (im using 3 internal at the moment but the other ones is coming in the mail soon :slight_smile:</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ZorgX</strong> on 27 Oct 2017, 17:26)</p>
