That new config-2.6.27 needs to be updated because when I make &quot;make V=99&quot; the configuration restarts and ask me to configure the new settings.<br/>After the reconfiguration, I have an error in crypt.c, the function kill_proc is no defined. I think it is defined in include/linux/sched.h as kill_proc_info, so I changed kill_proc to Kill_proc_info. I don&#039;t know if it the same thing but it passed to the next step. Now I have that error:<br/>drivers/net/imq.c: In function &#039;imq_nf_queue&#039;:<br/>drivers/net/imq.c:222: error: &#039;struct net_device&#039; has no member named &#039;queue_lock&#039;<br/>drivers/net/imq.c:223: error: &#039;struct net_device&#039; has no member named &#039;qdisc&#039;<br/>drivers/net/imq.c:234: error: &#039;struct net_device&#039; has no member named &#039;queue_lock&#039;<br/>drivers/net/imq.c: In function &#039;qdisc_run_tasklet&#039;:<br/>drivers/net/imq.c:252: error: &#039;struct net_device&#039; has no member named &#039;queue_lock&#039;<br/>drivers/net/imq.c:253: warning: passing argument 1 of &#039;qdisc_run&#039; from incompatible pointer type<br/>drivers/net/imq.c:255: error: &#039;struct net_device&#039; has no member named &#039;queue_lock&#039;<br/>they are making reference to elements of a structure that doesn&#039;t have the referenced elements...

(take a look at the output of make V=99 after make clean). I have tried to correct most of these patches so they are applied (some of them are already integrated in 2.6.27), but after that I have found that the B43 package won&#039;t compile (I don&#039;t really know, why there are three different sources for that piece (B43 package, compat-wireless and kernel). I have changed the makefile of B43 to just simply copy the source of B43 from compat-wireless (I had no better idea; compat-wireless and kernel source are almost the same anyway), and removed the backport patch. This way the whole thing builds, the router boots nicely, but the B43 module will give unknown symbol errrors (PIO and PCMCIA). If I have disabled them in the config.mk of compat-wireless, than B43 will load nicely (load the firmware, hostapd starts), but I cannot connect to the router, and it does not return any scan results either.</p><p>To be honest, I have no experience with linux, I have no idea how this should be done. Hope somebody can give us some clues.</p><p>EDIT: iwlist scan returns scan results. (just wlan0 is shut down, when hostapd is run).</p><p>EDIT: I have succeeded to make it work (had to put disable_drivers and allow-ap-vlan-modes patches back to mac80211 and apply hostap-fix to hostapd).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>umiki</strong> on 17 Oct 2008, 02:10)</p>

					<p>I am sorry, I have posted in the wrong thread (I meant to post to the more general thread brcm47xx and 2.6.27). I have a WL-500gP v1 (with the original wireless card)</p><p>It is working, and seems to be stable (not tested throughly). I can&#039;t tell if the wireless part has improved with the latest kernel and newer compat-wireless. With 2.6.25 speed was ok (~2000 kB/sec), but it was unstable (dropped connection after a larger amount of data was transferred), with 2.6.27 I don&#039;t know, because wireless transfer speed is somwhere near 100 kB/sec, so large amount of data has not been transfered...</p><p>If you are still interested, I can send you my files, but because I am not an expert, I don&#039;t think that the correction and selection of platform specific patches is properly done.
