					<p>Many Linux distributions are abandoning IA-32 support nowadays. So, I&#039;m working on an article for <a href="https://itsfoss.com">https://itsfoss.com</a> about free OS *still* supporting IA-32.</p><p>I successfully run OpenWRT Wi-Fi routers and ARM boards. And it is perfectly suitable to build a small web or file server.</p><p>Unfortunately, I can&#039;t find on the OpenWrt website a definitive answer to know if the IA-32 architecture is still supported. Both for legacy computers (i486/586/686) and for IA-32 SoC like the Intel Quark line.</p><p>Can anyone point me to the right source to know the definite support status of x86_32?</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br />- Sylvain</p>									</div>

					<p>For x86_32, the OpenWrt source tree has a platform target &#039;x86&#039; which has a subtarget &#039;legacy&#039;. This target currently has a single profile &#039;Generic&#039;.It supports x86_32 in general. </p><p>The target images have options for various root filesystem image formats, and also the option to build a VirtualBox or VMware image file directly.</p><p>However, I have no definitive answer on whether images compiled with this setup can execute on a specific i486, i586, i686 or Quark platform. This depends quite a lot on how the actual hardware. The images do integrate GRUB as a bootloader, and it seems to be version 2.02 so perhaps that will give you some ideas on where these images can boot.</p><p>Note that I am not a OpenWrt developer nor a person with any say on strategic decisions. The target/subtarget is there at the moment, but it may go away at some point just as well.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for your replay Antek!</p><p>Yes, it should still more or less work since the kernel maintains drivers for legacy x86 computers, and even for more modern x86 SoC like Intel Quark. That being said, I didn&#039;t find anything that lets me think the x86_32 is specially supported--not even tested--by the OpenWrt team. And the lack of answers here let me suppose few people in the community are actually (ab)using it on that hardware...</p><p>That being said, if someone has more infos about that, don&#039;t hesitate to let me know!</p>									</div>
