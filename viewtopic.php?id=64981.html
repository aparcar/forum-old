					<p>hello,</p><p>i am running OpenWrt on a TP-Link Archer C7 v2 (Powered by LuCI (git-15.248.30277-3836b45) / OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05).</p><p>The router only provides wifi for local devices; all routing is handled by a separate machine running pfSense connected via LAN. </p><p>There are two wifi networks: deathstar (nac network) and milleniumfalcon (bgn network). deathstar is for &quot;priority&quot; devices only, everything else connects to milleniumfalcon. Recently, many devices keep having awfully slow internet on milleniumfalcon or keep disconnecting, not being able to reconnect, etc etc.</p><p>Quick and dirty (and temporary) fix is logging into OpenWrt, disabling said network, then reenabling it; restarting the entire router does _not_ work. This is annoying, apparently.</p><p>Now here&#039;s the weird thing: when I check the wifi status, there are several networks for each SSID rather than just one each. I have attached a screenshot:</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/jBwafjk.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/jBwafjk.png" /></span></p><p>I assume this is why most devices have trouble connecting to this router. How can I fix the problem? Weirdly enough, my configuration has worked fine without any problems for months, I did not change anything, then suddenly this occurred.</p><p>Help is greatly appreciated. Thanks a lot in advance..</p>									</div>

					<p>I think you are misinterpreting the results of the &quot;associated stations&quot; list.&nbsp; The MAC addresses are your client devices, there is one for each connected client and it lists the SSID that the client is connected to.&nbsp; Above that list, where you see &quot;Wireless Overview&quot; and it lists your SSIDs and the BSSID for each is where you see all the MACs that are configured as Wifi SSIDs.&nbsp; You probably only see two there (one for MillenniumFalcon and one for DeathStar), right?</p><p>This is perfectly normal to see.&nbsp; You might have a problem, but &quot;the same ssid with different mac addresses&quot; is definitely not it. I would use the realtime graph when you are having a slowdown, to note the actual traffic bandwidth throughput (from the wlan interfaces) and tx rates (from the wifi section) to see if there is a device &quot;bogging&quot; all the others.&nbsp; Then check the kernel/system log to see if there are any phy errors or suspicious messages.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jeffmeden</strong> on 20 May 2016, 15:12)</p>

Does it fail to associate at all? Does it get connectivity if its wifi is turned off and back on? Does it have connectivity to any other local devices besides the OpenWRT device?</p>									</div>
