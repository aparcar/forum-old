					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have set up barrier breaker with a tunnelbroker.net tunnel. If I switch on router announcements on the LAN interface my clients pick up the v6 address of my router as a DNS server. I would like however a server on my LAN network to handle DNS requests (and forward them externally).<br />How do I override the standard DNS assignment?</p>									</div>

					<p>I remember reading over a month ago that an update to odhcpd would allow you to override the advertised default v6 gateway as well, but I haven&#039;t been able to find any config option for it on the odhcpd website.&nbsp; Anyone know anything about that?</p><p>Rodney</p>									</div>
