When you cycle power to router to boot and issue IP addresses via DHCP feature, you should first cycle power to modem and wait for the ready light on modem before applying power to router. It should then acquire the dynamic address along with the DNS addresses from your ISP and issue IP addresses to recognized LAN devices connected. You may even have to have your PC connected directly to LAN port after a flash to get the dynamic IP, DNS and DHCP working. My D-Link was very stubborn at times getting the DNS addresses to get the DHCP addresses issued when I used the factory f/w. My ISP suggested that I remove power and cable from modem and router wait at least 3 minutes to reset everything from scratch to get going again. I Don&#039;t seem any of these problems with OpenWrt!</p><p>And when you cycle power to router and hold the reset button, you will get the recovery mode with no INTERNET connection which is indicated by the described flashing of power light. That mode is for flashing f/w only and should be done using PC connected directly to LAN port of router.</p><p>Also the 3.11NA f/w may fail for VOIP due to SIP filtering enabled in advanced settings (I think that&#039;s where it is, been awhile for me). That feature should be unchecked for VOIP users.</p><p>There is an excellent OpenWrt WIP flash that works well for your router. You can find a lot of noob posts and replies here: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=98648">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=98648</a>, a good read starting at page 10 of thread for recent changes to the WIP (thread 1 of the post was in need of an update that last time I checked) I added a small package to my flash that works well for VOIP: siproxd</p><p>The OpenWrt trunk flashes are incomplete and require TELNET interface to the IP address via Windows Command Prompt to add missing Luci files (Web user Interface) but it&#039;s simple and once the newer trunks are flashed, upgrading to latest flash can easily be done within the web user interface. It may not be recommended but I can flash, add missing packages and configure without having to touch the router, modem or network (at least I&#039;m all hard-wired) once I got the initial trunk flash setup to work by using Luci and TELNET.</p><p>The trunk flashes are here: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/</a> the latest as of today is 20 Feb, 2010 about 16 files down.

					<p>Thanks for the detailed reply armchair, really appreciate it. </p><p>Normally when a router is reset and it is connected to a computer (without being connected to internet), the router assigns an IP address to the computer (via its DHCP, an IP address like 192.168.0.100 etc). I have a PPPoE connection, after resetting the router I have to configure it for PPPoE before it can acquire address from the ISP.</p><p>Without forcing the router to recovery mode I can not log-in to the router using the web interface (as it doesn&#039;t assign the IP address).</p><p>I have already tried flashing different firmwares, 3.01 (from D-Link), one of the WRTs and Trendnet as well but I can&#039;t seem to get DNS/DHCP or anything working in the router. The only thing that seems to work is recovery mode.</p><p>EDIT: The WLAN light is not turning ON too.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rocketscience1</strong> on 21 Feb 2010, 01:30)</p>

					<p>Whata stupid thing, so trivial... I was using Chrome browser, after attempting to flash using Internet Explorer seems like FW change was successful, now I can login to the router via web-interface! *phew*</p>									</div>

					<p>So what firmware are using?</p><p>Did you get your VOIP working properly?</p><p>Glad to see you got it going; another suggestion I omitted was setting your PC to static IP to flash and configure your router. After the router is configured, you can reset the PC to obtain address automatically.</p><p>Cheers</p>									</div>

					<p>I flashed the router with D-Link 3.01 FW, VOIP (ViaTalk, LinkSys PAP2T) works but its erratic, sometimes it will work and sometimes it won&#039;t. Outgoing call is delayed by more than 20 seconds, same VOIP box works really well with Dlink 624 (AirPlus Xtreme) with no delays in outgoing call.</p><p>I am assigning IP address manually whenever I need to flash and then set it back to automatic once flashing is successful, thanks for your suggestions <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Can&#039;t really comment on wireless performance but my DIR-615 C1 is improved all-around with OpenWrt. Completely different router; it&#039;s more reliable, consistent and works much better with my VOIP adapter. Before I flashed to OpenWrt, it was giving me intermittent slow connections so I flashed every update D-Link put out but nothing else helped it. I thought it was due to the fact I purchased a refurb unit. But that wasn&#039;t the case at all.</p><p>Too bad I can&#039;t say that about my new gigabit router that had a terminal power problem last night; power light went off during power-up, can&#039;t ping it, discover it or restore it. Device not found!<br />I&#039;ve flashed the D-Link many times with newer Kamikaze trunk snapshots, TELNET&#039;d in and added some packages, configured it with no problems. And that without having to touch my network. But yet the gigabit router has had very little run time on it and chose to self destruct before its potential was even realized; I was waiting on OpenWrt to get a WIP or release for it but now it&#039;s going back in its pretty box and back to manufacturer!</p><p>Highly recommend the trunk snapshots or compiling for the capable so inclined.</p>									</div>
