					<p>A routed network would suffice here, except that I suspect it will be unclear how the routes should be defined, given that the VLAN itself spans two routers.&nbsp; Routes are not sensitive to nuances like ARPs and thus are geared more towards routing across different subnets/VLANs, no?</p><p>If you meant &quot;why don&#039;t you use routing to allow the 172.16.1.0/24 wireless traffic to cross over the 172.16.0.0/24 wired network&quot;, that&#039;s precisely what I&#039;m trying to achieve, though I&#039;m less and less convinced it&#039;s possible.</p><p>Rodney</p>									</div>

					<p>I had a re look at the picture, I thought it was a /16 the whole thing being flat.&nbsp; But the first thing that caught my eye and what most people do (its actually the default setup) is to bridge the wireless and the lan together.</p><p>I have a rule to make all ethernet segment&#039;s == to ip networks [ there are alway exceptions].</p><p>This would help you in that you could watch the packets come to the router and move on {I have found bridging network much harder to diagnose}</p><p>If you want true wireless roaming switch to ipv6 mobile</p>									</div>
