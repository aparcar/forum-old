					<p>The &#039;del_client&#039; ubus call to hostapd can be used to dynamically disconnect and ban clients by their MAC address.&nbsp; The client will be banned from reconnecting for a period of time.&nbsp; You can set the time to very long and then if you want the client to be able to connect again, call again with a ban_time of 0.&nbsp; These bans are held in RAM, thus they will not persist through rebooting or restarting hostapd.&nbsp; </p><p>A persistent ban can be established by putting it in /etc/config/wireless, but changing those requires restarting hostapd which will disrupt service to all connected clients.</p>									</div>
