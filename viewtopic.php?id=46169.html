					<p>I&#039;m trying to get PlexConnect to run directly on my router (I think it&#039;s the perfect place for the process) but I&#039;m encountering some problems.&nbsp; </p><p>For those of you that don&#039;t know, PlexConnect lets you use your AppleTV to connect to your Plex server so you can use an AppleTV that has NOT been jail broken to stream media.&nbsp; It&#039;s really cool.&nbsp; </p><p>For more information on the software you can look here:</p><p>PlexConnect: <a href="https://github.com/iBaa/PlexConnect">https://github.com/iBaa/PlexConnect</a><br />Plex: <a href="http://www.plexapp.com/">http://www.plexapp.com/</a></p><br /><p>I managed to get Python installed and I copied the PlexConnect scripts into the router but when I start the script I&#039;m getting the following error:</p><p>Traceback (most recent call last):<br />&nbsp; File &quot;./PlexConnect.py&quot;, line 14, in &lt;module&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; from multiprocessing import Process, Pipe<br />ImportError: No module named multiprocessing</p><br /><p>I did a search and it LOOKS like this might be resolved by upgrading to Python 2.7.5.&nbsp; OpenWRT currently ships with 2.7.3.</p><p>So, I&#039;m wondering how I would upgrade the OpenWRT Python package to 2.7.5.&nbsp; I can see that the sources are available for that version of Python but I&#039;m not sure how to compile the software for the router.&nbsp; I&#039;ve built my own images for some time now so I DO have a build environment set up but I guess I don&#039;t know how to drop in my own source.</p>									</div>

					<p>Available iptables chains are listed in <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/firewall#packet.flow">wiki</a>.<br />As I understand it, standard PREROUTING chain is used by the system, &quot;zone_lan_prerouting&quot; is used internally by openwrt&#039;s firewall to place generated rules from /etc/config/firewall, and &quot;prerouting_lan_rule&quot; is suggested for custom user-defined rules. Probably there are some unobvious consequences when putting rule in one chain and not the other, which I&#039;m not sure.<br />Nevertheless, your rules for custom DNAT redirections is definitely should be placed in &quot;prerouting_lan_rule&quot; chain. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
