					<p>qos-scripts will also use fq_codel and is almost as good as sqm-scripts, but much easier to configure. i think your set up sounds right. Easiest way to test is to start pinging a reliable server close by, then start an ftp download and see if the ping goes way up. After that, try some web browsing with an ftp download going full speed. And finally, try some web downloads with the ftp download running full speed. This will give you an idea of how it will perform in your scenario.</p><p>The only thing I&#039;m not sure about is whether you will get 50/50 bandwidth distribution between your web download and ftp download or if the web download will be prioritized based on the port parameter you entered. Generally, qos-scripts and sqm-scripts aim for keeping latency low and dividing up bandwidth fairly.</p><p>One thing that occasionally trips people up is that they forget to enable and start qos-scripts (or sqm-scripts). This is done in Luci under system-&gt;startup. Set your upload and download to 95% of what your sustained bandwidth is.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drawz</strong> on 4 Nov 2014, 05:01)</p>

(in other words for internet via cable I would disable the overhead calculation)</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>- Half-Duplex: Disabled<br />- Download Speed: 20480<br />- Upload Speed: 2048</p></blockquote></div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Okay, typically it takes a bit to figure out the best shaping speeds, I would recommend to start at 90% of the speed as reported on your invoice (or reported by the cable modem) and then follow the instruction on <a href="http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/cerowrt/wiki/Quick_Test_for_Bufferbloat">http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/cer â€¦ ufferbloat</a> to see whether you are happy with the resulting latency under load. The best would be to use netperf-wrapper to test the effect of concurrent saturation of up- and downlink on the latency, but in case setting up netperf-wrapper is not an option, netperfrunner.sh should be good enough. It is best ti run these tests for several minutes (say 300seconds or so: netperfrunner.sh -t 300 ) and then look at the 90% and max latency...<br />Then you can slowly either ratted down or up the speeds until you reached the latency under load increase you are willing to live with. I would typically try to use the betterseedstest.sh to estimate the initial speeds by taking 90% of the reported values...</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p><strong>Current QOS Rules (In Order)</strong><br /><em>Settings not listed in rules below are set to &quot;All&quot; (Source Host, Destination Host, Service, etc)</em><br />- &quot;Priority&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- Ports 22, 53 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- Ports 20,25,80,110,443,993,995 / Number of Bytes: 1024<br />- &quot;Express&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- Ports 20,25,80,110,443,993,995<br />- &quot;Normal&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- Port 21 / Number of bytes: 1024 (For browsing directories in FTP Sites)<br />- &quot;Low&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- Port 21 / Destination Host: 192.168.0.200 (Server which downloads via FTP)</p><p>Again, if I configured anything incorrectly or you suggest any changes - even if you know a better solution than this for QOS, please let me knowâ€¦</p><p>Thanks!</p></blockquote></div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have no experience with qos-scripts subtler setting so can offer no useful opinion/advice...</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks Moeller0 - good info. At some point somebody should probably create an openwrt wiki page for sqm-scripts, with instructions on getting it working and configured on openwrt, as well as the pros/cons you mentioned (I think dtaht had a couple others a few months ago). This would go a long way to getting more people to use it. I&#039;ve been pretty happy with qos-scripts, so I haven&#039;t been motivated enough to play with sqm, but it sounds promising and will probably be more and more important as ipv6 traffic becomes more significant.</p>									</div>

If eth0.2 is the wan interface than SQM can easily shape while running on that. But if you run PPPoE fro your router than the inbuilt classification will not do the right thing as it does not look through the PPP encapsulation...</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>thdyck wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I wasn&#039;t sure if the ATM selection and 44 bytes of overhead was still needed when using the pppoe specific setup script.</p></blockquote></div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If your link runs on an ATM link (as most/all ADSL types do) you really need to select link layer ATM independent of whether you shape the pppoe interface or the physical interface. What this option really does is calculate the correct ATM-wire size of all data packets so they are accounted correctly against the link speed available... The actual overhead depends on the additional encapsulation your ISP forces on to you, 44 seems to be the maximum you will most likely encounter. (Actually if the DSL-modem terminates a clan from your ISP the worts case increases to 48 bytes, but that will be highly unlikely n the real world...)</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>thdyck wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>When starting, the script has a warning about sch_fq_codel not being found but it is part of the package kmod-sched / kmod-sched-core, so it appears this warning is not significant.</p></blockquote></div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So this is unfortunate but I do not see a way around this; if fq_codel is not built into the kernel but available as a module we need to load that module, otherwise SQM will not work. I might try to defuse this by hiding this benign error message in the future.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>thdyck wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I had problems with sqm not initializing on bootup; probably a race condition with pppoe-wan coming up.
