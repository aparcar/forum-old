					<p>I think knocking is the opposite of what you&#039;re looking for, Alex since that is designed to open ports based on outside &#039;knocks&#039; from remote addresses. If I understand you, you&#039;re looking to have the router open up the identd port and forward to an internal machine when it is connecting to an IRC server (remote ports 6667-7000 or some such). I believe mIRC &gt;= 7.1 supports the upnp protocol so if you can get that working on your OpenWRT router, that may solve your problem (see wiki for HOWTO).</p><p>As I recall, the old stock Linksys firmware had an ipt_TRIGGER module compiled into it, but I believe that this was against a much older iptables and a 2.4 kernel only. Anyone know if this has been ported to 2.6 or if there is an equivalent?</p>									</div>
