					<p>Hallo,</p><p>I am curios and was asking myself, if there are any/many Binary Blobs (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_blob">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_blob</a>) included in the Kernel used by OpenWrt. Are they marked particularly? Howto find them in the SourceCode?</p>									</div>

					<p>In the kernel are none <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />, but there is one kernel module, the broadcom wireless driver (broadcom-wl) and its authenticator, &quot;nas&quot;.</p><p>Apart from these two there&#039;s also a few firmwares for devices which aren&#039;t run on the system itself; these are often accepted as a necessary evil. Many wireless drivers include them, and for the dsl/atm drivers in ifxmips and ar7 its the same.</p><p>Everything else is afaik available in source form.</p><p>KM</p>									</div>
