					<p>I have an old machine lying around, which I was using as router up until a few years ago. I was running OpenBSD with pf, to do NAT and pretty much everything related to being a router.</p><p>Since then, I&#039;ve replaced it with dedicated routers (DIR-600, DIR-615), so I don&#039;t use the big machine anymore. Now, OpenWRT comes built for x68: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/x86/generic/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_br … 6/generic/</a><br />But I don&#039;t know how to install it. The only way I can think of, is take out the hard drive, put the image on it manually (with dd or so), but I haven&#039;t tested that, and I wonder if I can somehow install it, with the hard drive in situ.</p><p>Another way of putting it on the drive, is maybe booting a live OS and do it that way, but I really don&#039;t know. As OpenWRT is not coming with an installation environment like any other distro, I&#039;m struggling to think of the &quot;correct&quot; way to do it.</p>									</div>

					<p>If your machine&#039;s BIOS allows for booting from a USB device, put the OpenWRT x86 image <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/x86/generic/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_b … 6/generic/</a>&nbsp; on a USB flash drive and use Win32 Disk Imager to image the flash drive like would be done for a ARM type SOC.&nbsp; That would be the easiest thing to do if your circumstance allows.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>LeggoMyEggo</strong> on 31 Mar 2015, 02:47)</p>

					<p>It cannot boot from USB, only from CD. However there is a hard drive in that machine. I was thinking maybe booting gparted and writing the image to the hard drive.</p><p>Would that be a sensible approach?</p>									</div>

					<p>Unfortunately only played around with it inside a VM so can&#039;t help with an installer, but unless you&#039;re doing it for entertainment or education, that sounds like quite an expensive router to run.&nbsp; Power consumption alone would likely pay for a new, OpenWRT-capable bit of hardware in the space of a few months.</p><p>Depending on where in the world you live, the cost of running a 100W PC 24x7 could be well above US$100 per year.</p>									</div>
