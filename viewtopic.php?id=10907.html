					<p>On the 133, the memory is always reported as 16Mb when it in fact has 32Mb. This is the case with all the 100 series except the 112 and 133c.</p><p>The default of 16Mb is hard coded in prom.c as a default and retrieved using prom_getenv then the cmdline is checked to see if there is a memsize value. </p><p>For now, I can work around this by using patch-cmdline to set the memory size but this is not optimal IMHO. I think that the correct way to do this is to add a field to the adm5120_board structure with the memory size which would make it more consistent with the way that the flash size etc are reported in adm5120_info.c.</p><p>As I am a newb here and I am willing to correct this but before I do, I am looking for advice from others.</p><p>Thx,</p><p>Ian</p>									</div>
