					<p>I already have a working system that boots iPXE menu for my EFI computer, but for it to work with my BIOS PC, I need to offer a different file.</p><p>here&#039;s the most relevant lines in my /etc/config/dhcp on my openWRT router.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config boot
    option filename &#039;boot.ipxe&#039;
    option servername &#039;intwnr&#039;
    option serveraddress &#039;192.168.1.1&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Is there a configuration logic that can detect whether the client is BIOS/(U)EFI so that I can provide a different file?<br />According to <a href="http://ipxe.org/howto/chainloading#uefi">http://ipxe.org/howto/chainloading#uefi</a> I&#039;m looking for some kind of &quot;client arch code&quot; logic setting.</p><p>If there is no such setting in default OpenWRT dhcp service, perhaps there is another one supported that provides the desired functionality?? Or another solution?</p><p>Thanks! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>EDIT: Even if I get this question answered -- the DHCP server must also be able to acknowledge between the first and second request in order to not continually provide the same file.. That sounds complicated enough to urge me, since I&#039;m only working with one computer, to just figure out how to burn iPXE ROM directly to my motherboard, which I&#039;m working on currently. BUT, if you DO know how to get all of these things done. Please share your knowledge!! Nothing arose from a google search on this topic, so you could be the first to shed light on the matter.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bazz</strong> on 22 Nov 2015, 00:14)</p>

					<p>I found a solution at <a href="http://forum.ipxe.org/showthread.php?tid=6077">http://forum.ipxe.org/showthread.php?tid=6077</a></p><p>It would take a little more to parse UEFI, but I realized that I actually don&#039;t have to do that..<br />I realized that since my EFI box has IPXE -- which sends a unique option number (175) in the DHCP request, it can automatically load the correct tftp file given the same logic already provided from above solution.. Thus, I do not have to actually add EFI parsing logic. BUT, I do leave the beginning of that solution below as a commented line.</p><p><strong>Steps</strong><br />Comment out the whole &quot;boot&quot; section in /etc/config/dhcp and modify</p><p>/etc/dnsmasq.conf<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#IPXE MAGIC
dhcp-match=set:ipxe,175
#dhcp-match=set:efi,option:client-arch,93
dhcp-boot=tag:!ipxe,undionly.kpxe
dhcp-boot=boot.ipxe</code></pre></div><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/etc/init.d/network reload
/etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart</code></pre></div><p>The only further logic that could be added is to support UEFI chainloaded bootups (which require ipxe.efi), and man dnsmasq is all you really need to understand how to add that logic. (--tag-if=set)</p><p>P.S. I realize it is highly probable that the dnsmasq.conf settings oould be directly embedded in the UCI dhcp file, but I didn&#039;t bother learning how to do that. I&#039;m satisfied.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bazz</strong> on 22 Nov 2015, 04:10)</p>
