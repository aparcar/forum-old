					<p>I&#039;ve hacked two Zsun devices and they seem to present the same problem. I have updated the original firmware with the popular SD100-openwrt.tar.gz, and without any other intervention, when the wifi gets started (while booting) it resets the whole system. This goes over and over again, endlessly. </p><p>I have the uart being soldered and if I immediately delete the /etc/config/wireless after the console gets enabled (before allowing wifi driver to read and start the wifi) everything remains stable. If I restore the file and call &quot;wifi&quot;, the system gets rebooted.</p><p>On one of the devices, I&#039;ve replaced the flash memory with different chip from an working Carambola2 module. It presents the same problem, even with a completely new uboot and firmware. Getting mad, I&#039;ve looked for HW differences, and the only relevant one that I&#039;ve found was the quartz, which is 25MHz on zsun and 40MHz on Carambola2. So I&#039;ve replaced the Zsun quartz with an 40MHz and changed the according bootstrap pin. Tada! now it&#039;s working!</p><p>I haven&#039;t tested yet with SD100-openwrt.tar.gz build and 40MHz quartz, but I suspect it would work.</p><p>Does anyone encountered this issue? Does anyone know what is the relation between WiFi and the input quartz?</p>									</div>
