					<p>Yes, just try &quot;USB TTL&quot; on eBay, you&#039;ll get hundreds of results. They are really cheap like 2 $. If you&#039;re a bit lazy, find a one with cables provided.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey guys, first post here. Never used OpenWRT before. Main router is an RB951G-2hnD (with 1 USB port) Mikrotik with RouterOS and I have some older routers with DD-WRT (for the sake of simplicity of installation, I&#039;m not a CLI/*nix guy) acting as repeaters or client-bridges.</p><p>Turns out I digged a WNR1000v3 I left unused for a while because I needed the client funtionality and it didn&#039;t support it. DD-WRT doesn&#039;t support this router, so I started to get interested in OpenWRT.</p><p>Any progress on the development for this router?</p><p>I have two TP-Link WR702N (2MB flash, 8MB RAM) and I think I&#039;ll try and make a very lean OpenWRT for it - just for the hang of it. Heh<br />I&#039;ve also got a WR740N v4 and a WR841ND v9 running DD-WRT (the last one isn&#039;t stable though) which I&#039;m interested in converting to OpenWRT. Whatever is more stable, since they&#039;ll just be APs or clients/WDS and so on. The tough part is done through the RouterOS...</p><p>Oh, I also have a D-Link DIR-451 with USB and PCMCIA for 3G modems, and it would be nice if it could run a 4G LTE failover on the USB and a PCMCIA 802.11ac (or n at least, since it&#039;s a G unit) on OpenWRT. &gt;:-)</p>									</div>

					<p>The tplink 841nd runs openwrt great, it&#039;s the most stable router I&#039;ve ever had. If either you or me get around to provding these guys the with the ram dumps of this Netgear than we will get it to work. I forgot to get a serial usb cable.

					<p>@ALL</p><p>Do not bother about this crappy peace of hardware. Its nearly fully unusable for openwrt. I have spend some time into this peace.</p><p>First: The WNR1000v3 does not have any normal serial connector. You have to find out one by your own and solder to the board.</p><p>Second: It only have 16MB of ram. I opened up and can confirm that. You can read that here: <a href="https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Netgear_WNR1000v3">https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Netgear_WNR1000v3</a></p><p>Third: This 333Mhz SoC build in is terrible. Its horrible slow. Dont invest time into getting support for that.</p><p>With 16MB RAM you cant run something like luci. You would have to set this thing up with command line.</p><p>Solution: Throw this thing out or call netgear for replacement. There is a reason for replacement because the wnr1000v3 also running exremely terrible with the normal preinstalled firmware by netgear. Why replacement - because the recent WNR1000v4 have enough ram (32MB), it have a much better SoC with 580Mhz and its not broadcom - its MediaTek(ralink). <a href="https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Netgear_WNR1000v4">https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Netgear_WNR1000v4</a></p>									</div>
