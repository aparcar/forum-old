					<p>Guys/Gals</p><p>I haven&#039;t done a build for I guess about a couple of years now and last night decided I needed to do one to update some of my personal scripts that I include in my build.</p><p>As I&#039;d done a rebuild on the workstation that actually does the build I needed to &#039;start from scratch&#039; to generate the appropriate build components.</p><p>Included in my build from a couple of years back was aircrack-ng and reaver as I&#039;m always interested in the latest security tools and whether they work or not, also useful when trying to convince a client that their security isn&#039;t good enough.</p><p>What&#039;s happened to the packages?</p><p>I did all the svn co.......</p><p>script feeds update -a</p><p>script feeds install -a</p><p>NO aircrack-ng or reaver packages......Hmmmmm</p><p>So I fired up a browser and had a look at github and it appears the packages are no longer there at all.</p><p>Searching the forums throws up no comments regarding removal or retirement so what&#039;s the deal?&nbsp; Is the build environment broken or have they really been removed and if so why?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>
