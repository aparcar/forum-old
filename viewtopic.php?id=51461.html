					<p>Sounds like it is bricked. I did the same with my wr1043nd and was able to bring it back. Here is a link to what looks like pretty good instruction for the wr3420. It is slightly different from what I had to do for the 1043.</p><br/><p><a href="http://blog.technicentral.com/index.php/2-routers/1-mr3420-unbrick">http://blog.technicentral.com/index.php/2-routers/1-mr3420-unbrick</a></p>									</div>
