					<p>thanks Schuggy for the link.</p><p>However what I am interested in viewing is what&#039;s under the shield cover and especially at the termination point for the centre aerial on the pcb.</p><p>To explain, most of the N Systems seem to have two radio modules, each with their own receiver antennae placed at the opposite ends of the case, but combine the transmit sides into the ONE antennae at the middle. I want to be able to split this back to individual aerials so that I can have one Transmit/Receive pair available for extension to another building level while still having local connections via the normal aerials. This is also because both building floors are small and will only have a maximum of eight and four wireless connections. </p><p>Looking at the pic, it&#039;s almost as if the unit is only using one transmit side? with the other one not connected, but I suspect it&#039;s all under the cover.</p><p>On another sub-topic, does the 1043nd have fixed transmit/receive power levels or are they adjustable through the firmware?</p><p>thanks again<br />scsijon</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>scsijon</strong> on 17 Jan 2010, 07:36)</p>
