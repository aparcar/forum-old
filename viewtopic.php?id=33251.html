					<p>Hi all, I&#039;m trying to setup an openvpn connection in order to play LAN games with friends across the state. I&#039;ve got this mostly working but still have one nagging issue I&#039;m hoping you guys can help me fix.</p><p>I used the configuration guide here - so if you want to know my configuration it is exactly that. I did not do the bridge guide at the end because it seems to be another method or a &quot;duplicate&quot; of the first guide but correct me if I&#039;m wrong. I did bridge via the GUI like it shows in the first guide.</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.openvpn">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.openvpn</a></p><p>The issue is that when I host the game (192.168.1.110) my VPN users can&#039;t see my game but can still join it by entering my IP. However, if one of my VPN users hosts the game I can see and join their game like I want.</p><p>I can ping the user and the VPN user can ping me. We are also able to share files using regular windows SMB sharing. Windows firewall is turned off on both machines and I&#039;ve changed the OpenVPN adapter on the VPN user&#039;s PC to be the highest in priority.</p><br/><p>Host Router with OpenVPN: 192.168.1.1<br/>Host of Game IP: 192.168.1.110</p><p>VPN Client IP: 192.168.1.151<br/>VPN Client&#039;s non-openvpn or his local private IP given to him by his router: 192.168.1.105</p><p>I had this working before with DD-WRT w/ bcrelay and PPTP but obviously this isn&#039;t the same. I remember in that situation I had to have my VPN users on a different range of IP&#039;s like 192.168.0.1 - don&#039;t know if it is the same in this circumstance?</p><p>Also, If I have my vpn range as 192.168.1.X isn&#039;t it possible for his openvpn IP to conflict with the addresses given out by his routers DHCP? I mean I obviously can&#039;t account for every DHCP server of my connecting VPN users. Is there some sort of protection in place so this doesn&#039;t happen or is it a non-issue when it is on the VPN adapter?</p><p>How can I fix this guys?</p><p>Edit: realized I left out I&#039;m using Backfire 10.03.1-rc6</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>patriotdow</strong> on 1 Dec 2011, 06:01)</p>

					<p>OpenVPN in combination with Windows 7 has an issue about forwarding UDP broadcasts to all adapters.&nbsp; No matter what adapter priorities are set in the operating system games like to send broadcast requests for LAN servers on the main LAN adapter, not the VPN one. </p><p>For Blur with OpenVPN I first tried to use hanksoft <a href="http://www.hanksoft.de/service/46-udpbroadcastforwarder">UDPBroadcastForwarder</a>, but that didn&#039;t work, however <a href="http://www.espend.de/artikel/gameserver-ueber-hamachi-tunngle-und-co-werden-windows-7-nicht-angezeigt.html?version=1.0.0.0">HamachiBroadcastFixGUI</a> did. Make sure to run the forwarder on the client computers. </p><p>Another alternative that might work is to use Tunngle instead of OpenVPN. Tunngle is a currently free game centric VPN based on OpenVPN. Since Februrary they allow you to set up password protected private &quot;rooms&quot; with up to 32 players.</p>									</div>
