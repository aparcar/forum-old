					<p>Hello,</p><p> Can anyone point me towards a good general guide of getting SNORT running on 15.05 in IPS mode? I have been trying to get it to run on the WAN interface with little success so far.&nbsp; I used opkg repository for the install and out of the box edited the /etc/config/snort to point at WAN but so far I do not see it sending anything to the log file I setup in /etc/snort/snort.conf. I also tried editing /etc/init.d/snort to include -Q but so far it just crashes. Has anyone had any success in getting it up and running in IPS mode? </p><p>Thanks&nbsp; for your help in advance.</p>									</div>
