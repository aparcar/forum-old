					<p>Hey all, I&#039;m having a hell of a time trying to get a wireless bridge to work on this router.&nbsp; I am basically using the G300NH to connect my wired computers to my wireless router a few rooms away.&nbsp; I have a stupid xfinity router (Arris TG862G) as the main router (know ways to hack it? ;-) </p><p>First, things are slow as hell: on speedtest.net I get less than 1mbps down and 15mbps up! Also, when I ping the router from my computer, I get a bunch of duplicate pings (DUP!).&nbsp; I followed the directions to the best of my abilities and been poking around the forums and can&#039;t find anything regarding this slow down. </p><p>Thanks, any help would be appreciated!</p>									</div>
