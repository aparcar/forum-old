					<p>I just picked up one of these TM02&#039;s and saw in an Amazon review mention of OpenWrt.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m totally new here, and while I haven&#039;t opened command line for probably a year or two, back in the day I set up my own linux webserver to host my blog and podcast and such.&nbsp; So I have SOME experience, but am not a seasoned pro by any means.</p><p>Why should I install OpenWrt?&nbsp; If I primarily want to use it to serve up movies for the kids to watch on a Galaxy, Kindle Fire, iPad and iPhone, will switching to OpenWrt give me better options?</p><p>Also, I have always been vaguely interested in the PirateBox project.&nbsp; I was able to find one related post, but it wasn&#039;t clear if it would work on it.&nbsp; Think it would be a good solution for it?</p><p>Finally...&nbsp; if I do install the basic package of OpenWrt from the first post in this thread...&nbsp; Does it function the same way the original factory software does but have options to do even more?&nbsp; Or will it require significant tweaking to get it to do the basic functions, namely bridging wired connections, relaying wireless ones, sharing files, etc....</p><p>Thanks.&nbsp; Sorry for the newb dump.&nbsp; I&#039;ve spent a bunch of time reading posts, but I feel like I&#039;m playing CSI OpenWrt.&nbsp; hoping someone with the 411 can give me the straight scoop!</p>									</div>

					<p>You are trying to do a routed client, where the router is actually routing multiple users back to one wan connection that looks like one user to the hotel, right?&nbsp; </p><p>It is probably a good idea to NOT use the same SSID for your generated &quot;relay&quot; AP as the one you are client on.&nbsp; I think you mentioned that at first.&nbsp; Also of course the wan and lan IPs need to be in a different subnet.&nbsp; Sometimes it works (sort of) if they are in the same subnet but overall that is not right.</p>									</div>

					<p>The simplest way is just to open ports 80 and 22 into the router from the wan side, then you can use LuCI or ssh respectively from your PC in the home router&#039;s network.&nbsp; Give the TM02 a reserved address (in the 200.x range) in your home router&#039;s dhcp table so you can find it.</p><p>The usual AP-client link can only handle one MAC address as the client, so you have to route through it you can&#039;t bridge a bunch of stuff through.&nbsp; There is a way to work around that but I have never tried.&nbsp; My home network is mostly mesh-based which avoids that problem.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 3 May 2015, 16:30)</p>
