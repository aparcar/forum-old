					<p>I&#039;m new to OpenWRT so please bear with me. I really hope I&#039;ve done my research. I spent all last night learning how packages and init scripts work, how to check the system logs, etc. I&#039;ve just run out of ideas as to why this isn&#039;t working.</p><p>So I have a USB enclosure that holds two 2TB drives. Both drives are formatted HFS+, as they were originally used on a Mac. I&#039;d really like to keep them that way if at all possible. I noticed that HFS+ has good filesystem performance on this router, so I was optimistic (I mean, how else would you test it?). I hope to hook this up via the USB port on my TL-WR1043ND and share over Samba.</p><p>I downloaded all the packages I thought I&#039;d need, got everything set up nicely but for some reason, the volumes just won&#039;t mount! I&#039;ll run through some of the boot process and some debugging I&#039;ve done to figure out where the problem is. I&#039;ve trimmed out parts of the log having to do with other stuff for readability.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />ar71xx-ehci ar71xx-ehci: Atheros AR91xx built-in EHCI controller<br />kernel: ar71xx-ehci ar71xx-ehci: new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 1<br />kernel: ar71xx-ehci ar71xx-ehci: irq 3, io mem 0x1b000000<br />kernel: ar71xx-ehci ar71xx-ehci: USB 2.0 started, EHCI 1.00<br />kernel: usb usb1: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice<br />kernel: hub 1-0:1.0: USB hub found<br />kernel: hub 1-0:1.0: 1 port detected<br />… <br />ohci_hcd: USB 1.1 &#039;Open&#039; Host Controller (OHCI) Driver<br />info kernel: Initializing USB Mass Storage driver...<br />info kernel: scsi0 : SCSI emulation for USB Mass Storage devices<br />info kernel: usbcore: registered new interface driver usb-storage<br />info kernel: USB Mass Storage support registered.<br />debug kernel: usb-storage: device found at 2<br />debug kernel: usb-storage: waiting for device to settle before scanning<br />info sysinit: WARNING: /lib/functions/fsck not found<br />notice kernel: scsi 0:0:0:0: Direct-Access&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;WDC WD20 EARS-00MVWB0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;50.0 PQ: 0 ANSI: 4<br />notice kernel: scsi 0:0:0:1: Direct-Access&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;WDC WD20 EARS-00MVWB0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;50.0 PQ: 0 ANSI: 4<br />debug kernel: usb-storage: device scan complete<br />…<br />notice kernel: sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] 3907029168 512-byte logical blocks: (2.00 TB/1.81 TiB)<br />notice kernel: sd 0:0:0:1: [sdb] 3907029168 512-byte logical blocks: (2.00 TB/1.81 TiB)<br />notice kernel: sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Write Protect is off<br />debug kernel: sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Mode Sense: 11 00 00 00<br />err kernel: sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Assuming drive cache: write through<br />notice kernel: sd 0:0:0:1: [sdb] Write Protect is off<br />debug kernel: sd 0:0:0:1: [sdb] Mode Sense: 11 00 00 00<br />err kernel: sd 0:0:0:1: [sdb] Assuming drive cache: write through<br />err kernel: sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Assuming drive cache: write through<br />info kernel:&nbsp; sda:<br />err kernel: sd 0:0:0:1: [sdb] Assuming drive cache: write through<br />info kernel:&nbsp; sdb: sda1<br />warn kernel:&nbsp; sdb1<br />err kernel: sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Assuming drive cache: write through<br />notice kernel: sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Attached SCSI disk<br />err kernel: sd 0:0:0:1: [sdb] Assuming drive cache: write through<br />notice kernel: sd 0:0:0:1: [sdb] Attached SCSI disk<br />…<br />info kernel: yaffs: dev is 8388609 name is &quot;sda1&quot;<br />info kernel: yaffs: passed flags &quot;&quot;<br />warn kernel: yaffs: Attempting MTD mount on 8.1, &quot;sda1&quot;<br />info kernel: yaffs: dev is 8388609 name is &quot;sda1&quot;<br />info kernel: yaffs: passed flags &quot;&quot;<br />warn kernel: yaffs: Attempting MTD mount on 8.1, &quot;sda1&quot;<br />notice fstab: mount: mounting /dev/sda1 on /mnt/sda1 failed: Invalid argument<br />info kernel: yaffs: dev is 8388625 name is &quot;sdb1&quot;<br />info kernel: yaffs: passed flags &quot;&quot;<br />warn kernel: yaffs: Attempting MTD mount on 8.17, &quot;sdb1&quot;<br />info kernel: yaffs: dev is 8388625 name is &quot;sdb1&quot;<br />info kernel: yaffs: passed flags &quot;&quot;<br />warn kernel: yaffs: Attempting MTD mount on 8.17, &quot;sdb1&quot;<br />notice fstab: mount: mounting /dev/sdb1 on /mnt/sdb1 failed: Invalid argument<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>So what I get out of this is the host controller is found and loaded, the port is detected, the drive controller is detected, the disks are detected (they are indeed western digitals as noted), but when it comes time for fstab to mount the drives, it chokes with &quot;Invalid Argument&quot;. The fact that &quot;yaffs&quot; is reporting these messages confuses me a little. Isn&#039;t that a different file system from hfs+?</p><p>So my next step is since the router can see these drives, I&#039;ll mount them manually. Maybe fstab was doing something dumb like detecting the wrong file system. So I check with fdisk -l:</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />root@OpenWrt:~# fdisk -l</p><p>WARNING: GPT (GUID Partition Table) detected on &#039;/dev/sda&#039;!

The error messages I&#039;m getting aren&#039;t particularly helpful and I think I&#039;ve googled the same 6 words in different orders a thousand times now. If anyone could offer some suggestions, I&#039;d really appreciate it.</p><p>Some more details:<br />I&#039;m working with OpenWRT Backfire 10.03.1-rc4, and given it all the packages I think I&#039;d need to hook up a USB drive and share files. Here&#039;s a listing of all the relevant packages I&#039;ve got installed:</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />block-hotplug<br />block-mount<br />fdisk<br />hotplug2<br />kmod-fs-hfs<br />kmod-fs-hfsplus<br />kmod-fs-msdos<br />kmod-fs-ntfs<br />kmod-fs-vfat<br />kmod-nls-base<br />kmod-nls-utf8<br />kmod-scsi-core<br />kmod-usb-core<br />kmod-usb-ohci<br />kmod-usb-storage<br />kmod-usb2<br />luci-app-samba<br />samba3<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Just grabbed a bunch of file systems that I thought I&#039;d want in the future and character support packages because I couldn&#039;t figure out which went with which.</p>									</div>

The last step I got to was making an image with GUID support, getting HFS+ drives mounted, and getting netatalk setup and working to share the drives. I could connect to the router from my Mac using afp://192.168.1.1, punch in real credentials (not just guest!) and even play movie files off the connected GUID HFS+ formatted hard drives! I was really excited to get that far. But! Always but. There were a few dealbreakers I couldn&#039;t work around.</p><p>1.) The drives kept mounting as read-only because fsck.hfs isn&#039;t available for OpenWRT. I was in the process of making a package for that. I got the files from Apple and patches to make it work under Linux but I stopped work on that because there appeared to be an even bigger problem...</p><p>2.) The wireless connection was unstable as all hell. I&#039;d get 700KB/s for a while streaming a movie file, then something would flicker out and the whole wireless network would go down. I could not manage to make a build of OpenWRT that would run reliably! I tried trunk, rc4, and backfire with backported fixes. None would sustain 6MB transfer rates or let me transfer files for more than a minute without crashing and burning. I tried compiling my own image without any of the disk mounting or AFP stuff and I got the same behavior copying files from a computer on the wired LAN. So it&#039;s not some weird interaction, something&#039;s just unstable with this wireless chipset.</p><p>The most stable firmware I&#039;ve found is the rc4 premade image download, which lets me transfer sustained at 6.6MB/s and use MBR formatted disks. I went with that for a while but it was kind of unstable too. Booting me off the wireless network every few hours too.</p><p>So I shelved the project and went back to my old router for now. It&#039;s slow and there&#039;s no USB disk support but it&#039;s stable enough to run for years uninterrupted. I&#039;ll check back in a few months and give it another go with the next milestone release. I filed a ticket requesting GUID partition support get built into all images from now on. We&#039;ll see how that goes. If the change gets incorporated, you could recreate what I&#039;ve done using the stock image downloads and installing packaged from LuCI. That would be the best.</p>									</div>
