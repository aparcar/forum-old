All you have to do is run chillispot, and point to FON&#039;s RADIUS servers. I&#039;ve modified my La Fonera&#039;s quite a bit, but they are still accessible as hotspots. If anything, having a whole community full of these things would help FON, not hurt them, so long as you maintain the connection to FON. Further, I see no particular reason why I have to be locked into FON&#039;s firmware just to be a Fonero.</p><p>If anything, FON should be trying to build community mesh networks. Having randomly placed hotspots is next to useless. How many folks are going to take the time to drive/walk to the middle of nowhere with their laptop just to get on the Internet? Seriously, have you looked at the FON maps and seen how many hotspots are out in the boonies?</p>									</div>
