					<p>Hey Guys, I&#039;m looking for a little guidance on how to get started implementing the following scenario on my TP-Link WRT-1043N running OpenWrt Barrier Breaker 14.07. I&#039;m very n00bish to networking and I&#039;m looking for some guidance around &quot;Best Practice&quot; and some assistance with my conf if your available to help. </p><p>Within my home network I wont to be able to isolate my hypervisor traffic into its own network, ideally utilising VLAN tagging.&nbsp; I am using the &#039;guest&#039; interface for my guest WiFi, the lan interface for general LAN traffic, which the hypervisor traffic is currently using. Ideally this will be on the 192.168.2.0/24 network. </p><p>Sorry for the vagueness of my post, really just looking to find out where I should start looking. </p><p>Thanks in advance. </p><p>:/etc/config/network</p><p>config globals &#039;globals&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ula_prefix &#039;fdbc:83fe:ceff::/48&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;loopback&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;lo&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;127.0.0.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask &#039;255.0.0.0&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option force_link &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option type &#039;bridge&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;192.168.1.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ip6assign &#039;60&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;dhcp&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;guest&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;10.0.0.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;</p><p>config switch<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option name &#039;switch0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option reset &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option enable_vlan &#039;1&#039;</p><p>config switch_vlan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;switch0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ports &#039;0 1 2 3 4&#039;</p><p>config switch_vlan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;switch0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan &#039;2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ports &#039;5 6&#039;</p>									</div>

					<p>You can use the web interfac for this basic configuration, it simplifies things.<br />First note that the hardware is somewhat unusual:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/_detail/media/wr1043ndv2-schematics.png?id=toh%3Atp-link%3Atl-wr1043nd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/_detail/media/w â€¦ l-wr1043nd</a><br />Under &quot;switch&quot;&nbsp; create another VLAN, number 3.&nbsp; Don&#039;t mess with the original two VLANs.&nbsp; Make VLAN 3 tagged into CPU port 0 along with VLAN 1.<br />Move the physical ethernet ports that you want to be guest from VLAN 1 (untagged) to VLAN 3 (untagged).&nbsp; Untagged means that the internal tagging is stripped off before the packet goes out the ethernet cable, so that the signal is compatible with ordinary devices that are not VLAN aware.</p><p>Under network interfaces, physical settings, make sure eth1.1 is still on the lan and then connect eth1.3 to the guest.&nbsp; Do not have eth1 (with no dot) connected to anything.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 17 Mar 2015, 04:09)</p>

					<p>Hey thanks mk24, that&#039;s exactly what the guidance I was after. I just didn&#039;t know where to start. </p><p>And thanks for going the extra distance and posting the schematic as well, very helpful.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Beware of your TP-1043ND version, if its V2 it may not support everything you need in terms of VLAN.</p><p>Check the forum, namely <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=56016">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=56016</a></p><p>Good luck,<br />Jabss</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jabss</strong> on 17 Mar 2015, 22:25)</p>

					<p>maybe my postings here will help you: <br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=54791">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=54791</a><br />if with hypervisor-traffic you mean traffic of a virtualmachine on your server/workstation<br />I did something like that. a debian server connected with one ethernet-interface to my openwrt-box (using as VLAN-trunk).<br />the traffic of the host-system is in the LAN, the traffic of the guest-system (kvm) is on a different VLAN, which is configured as DMZ so complete separation on layer2</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 18 Mar 2015, 00:09)</p>
