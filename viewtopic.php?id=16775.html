					<p>Hello all,<br />In a meeting with other people working on a mesh router project with me, one fellow had the suggestion that sqlite be used as a repository of configuration information as opposed to numerous configuration text files. I dismissed it at the time, because I thought of SQL servers as being heavy and difficult, but the more I have read about sqlite the more I am convinced that it is possible to use this lightweight db server to contain the configuration of various services on an embedded platform. I know, however, that implementation would be a fair amount of work. Yet I&#039;d like to propose it as an option to the UCI, because I think it is more efficient and ultimately, more robust.</p><p>I&#039;d be interested in hearing what other people have to say, particularly those who manage the ports of various projects with complex configuration files, in OpenWRT.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hmm, maybe there can be SQL (sqlite) support added to UCI instead of config files by writing a plugin for UCI. I don&#039;t know...</p>									</div>

The libsqlite2 package weighs in at 140KB or more depending on the platform, tack on an extra 30KB or more for libsqlite3; libuci and uci combined consume 19-21KB. SQL makes sense for many kinds of data, and I am a big fan of SQLite, but it doesn&#039;t make sense for simple key-value pairs of configuration data on embedded platforms with such limited storage space.</p>									</div>

					<p>It depends on how much storage you have vs. cpu power available. I guess I should have pointed out that I am using Avila boards and other systems without many limitations on the amount of flash memory available.</p>									</div>
