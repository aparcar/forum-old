					<p>Hi,</p><p>Last year I installed an outdoor wireless network consisting of 5 WRT54GL APs built into outdoor enclosures. I equipped them all with a single external 9dbi omnidirectional antenna, and connected them using WDS. As a gateway I use Chillispot and Freeradius running against a MySQL server. This setup was functioning well.</p><p>However, over time I have seen that the radio signals has been weaker and weaker, and I am now having serious problems with the APs seeing each other. I have tried all OpenWRT Whiterussian releases from RC5 and up, with the same bad result. I have also tried all antenna diversity/power settings, as well as changing channels etc.</p><p>My suspicion is now that there is something wrong with the hardware, but it seems very unlikely that all APs suddenly are showing the same low signal level, so I am a bit puzzled here to.</p><p>What really confuses me is that this setup was working great when I installed it, but now has degraded over time.</p><p>Any suggestions, or similar experiences?</p><p>BR</p><p>Arne-J.</p>									</div>

Even if the connector is not directly exposed to rain, humidity will creep in unless you have a perfect seal, and that destroys the cable, and possibly the connector.</p>									</div>

					<p>with a S/N ratio ~ 17 dB you should be able to get much better result than 1 Mbps datarate.</p><p>Has this datarate been better in the past ? (am asking because if it never was good the distance may be too big and you need to set the wl0_distance parameter).</p><p>If the modulation data rate was much higher in the past I can only explain the problem from interference on the channel, from other signals than wlan. <br />FM transmitters, as used in AV links, are very capable of destroying wlan datatransport while not being properly detected by the wlan hardware. Can only suggest to choose a radically different channel, e.g. 14 for testing purpose, and see if it makes a difference.</p><p>a typical example of a &#039;good&#039; wrt54gl client (the one this message goes through):<br /># wl rssi ; wl noise ; wl rate<br />rssi is -66<br />noise is -96<br />rate is 54 Mbps</p><p>a weak brother in our network (also a wrt54gl) but in a noise free rural environment over more than 1 km distance using a directional antenna on the client side and a 7 element collinear array (omni-directional antenna with vertical polarization) at the access point<br /># wl rssi ; wl noise ; wl rate<br />rssi is -88<br />noise is -96<br />rate is 24 Mbps</p><p>The last result illustrates that the problem in your case probably is not the signal strength but some sort of interference, reflections from nearby objects, or timing issues.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>doddel</strong> on 8 Jun 2007, 00:01)</p>

					<p>OK, I have finally solved this.</p><p>It appears that my antenna cable was the problem. I appearantly have not sealed the cable properly, and have now replaced it with a properly sealed cable. The results I get now are:</p><p>wl rate: rate is 48 Mbps<br />wl noise: noise is -12</p><p>Also, my antenna and enclosure connectors are both pointing downwards, so luckily I did not have to replace the antenna and pigtail.</p><p>The lesson learned from this is: Always properly seal your antenna connectors on outdoor solutions!!</p><br /><br /><p>Arne-J.</p>									</div>
