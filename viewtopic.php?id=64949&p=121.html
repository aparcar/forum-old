I continued my setup for the rest of the router and what do you know I get the same problem as before after installing and setting up openvpn-policy-routing package. again unchecking the checkbox for ignore resolve file fixes it.

So do either of you have any insight that could maybe help me out?</p><p>NOTE 1: I noticed that before checking the box for ignore resolve file that the line below it &quot;Resolve file&quot; was populated with one of the /tmp/resolv.conf files. After unchecking ignore resolve file again the line &quot;Resolve file&quot; no longer was populated with the /tmp/resolv.conf file it is just blank now. So maybe just deleting this line has the same effect as checking the box?</p><p>NOTE 2: I did reboot the router after changing any of the settings just to be sure.</p><p>Thanks for all your help fellas, I really appreciate it!</p></blockquote></div><p>I can&#039;t really help with openvpn, no experience.&nbsp; As for unchecking the box for ignore resolve file, even if the field for resolve file is left blank, it will still pull DNS servers from /etc/resolv.conf if the box is unchecked (/etc/resolv.conf and /tmp/resolv.conf are both auto-generated based on your ISP&#039;s DNS servers).&nbsp; At least for my setup, the contents of /tmp/resolv.conf and /etc/resolv.conf are always the same, filled with my ISP&#039;s DNS servers.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>starcms</strong> on 10 Aug 2017, 01:08)</p>
