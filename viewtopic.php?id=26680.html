					<p>I was actually having the same issue compiling from trunk (pre-made images are missing luci as well I see). Since I am completly new to this, what is the proper procedure for compiling from trunk but also getting luci built in? Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>

					<p>I went with the Kamakazi distribution (10.03.1 RC3) and Luci installed and loaded just fine. Thanks for the information. Also, I had better luck with the Firmware Recovery method than I did using the DLink firmware intall utility. The router works great with exception of wireless N. When I turn it on, the wireless connections tend to drop internet connectivity (wired connecitons are fine). Disabling N and running G only cleared that up. It would be nice to see N speeds but I&#039;ll trade it for stable connections.</p>									</div>
