					<p>Hello, </p><p>Is it possible to use OpenWrt, on a RouterStation Pro, as a platform for signal processing ?</p><p>I am designing a wireless mesh network where the nodes will also do some signal processing. Ubiquiti&#039;s RouterStation Pro (or even the RouterStation) seems to me a quite nice solution, since it solves the routing and radio problems. However, I am a little concerned about the number crunching. </p><p>The processor is quite fast (680 MHz), but I was wondering how much of it can be used for the application ? <br />Also, I am worried with software compatibility issues : will it be possible to install bash, gcc, GSL, Python, Octave and other applications ?<br />Maybe it is just a matter of recompiling everything from source. But I wonder if there are other hidden issues that I cannot see at this moment. </p><p>Of course, I have considered the possibility of using an x86 compatible embedded PC, like the PcEngines Alix. Software installation would be much easier. However, the routing and radio problems would be solved with less efficiency. </p><p>I wonder if any of you has some experience related with this. <br />Thanks for your help. </p><p>Cheers, <br />Gibil</p>									</div>
