					<p>Ok,</p><p>I know its probably not a bug with the software but something funky with my configuration but I for the life of me cannot figure it out.</p><p>Network topology is like so...</p><p>wrt54glv1.1 lan port -&gt; uvers routers lan port (which hands out dhcp adresses for wireless clients) which go out to the internet.</p><p>I can connect to the wrt&#039;s ssid and get out to the internet no problem whatsoever. Wifidog is clear that it can communicate with auth server etc (ping/pongs at the command line). </p><p>Now the problem... NOTHING is ever redirected to auth server for authentication, it just automatically goes out to the net.</p><p>I didnt see anything in the install saying I need to play with iptables rules or anything along those lines... anyone have *ANY* pointers whatsoever on things to check?</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>									</div>
