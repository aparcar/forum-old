					<p>hello everyone,</p><p> first off i would like to say hello as i am new to the community. so hello! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>anyways, i have a small issue. im trying to flash the latest (trunk) image of openWrt onto my router, but there seems to be a issue with the flashing procdure. doing both the 30 second reset and power button method to get it to go into easy GUI mode for flashing, and tftp, i cannot get the router to load the image. does anyone know what i am doing wrong? running Windows 64-bit, so i have added the tftp component to windows.</p>									</div>

					<p>DSL-2740B does not require 30 sec of reset.</p><p>Just turn it off, press the reset button, turn it back on while keeping the reset button pressed and after a few seconds the power button becomes red (orange to be more specific). Navigate to <a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a> and upload the image.</p><p>TFTP is a method I have not tested.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>corrupted</strong> on 11 Dec 2012, 19:14)</p>

					<p>I would download the image again, maybe it&#039;s corrupt some way.<br />If the image was downloaded correctly, I would wait for the next trunk release and use AA rc1 until then.<br />And if the problem persists in the next trunk release, I would open a ticket in dev.openwrt.org</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>corrupted</strong> on 12 Dec 2012, 00:02)</p>

					<p>Do you have an original firmware for the NA version?<br />If yes, you can open it with a hex editor and check the header/first bytes of the firmware.</p><p>For example...</p><p>The EU 1.0 firmware for F1 has these lines:<br />6...Broadcom Corporatio.4.06.01.EUF1..6328..AW4339U.....</p><p>And the AU 2.07 firmware for F1 has these lines:<br />6...Broadcom Corporatio.4.06.01.AUF1..6328..AW4339U.....</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>corrupted</strong> on 12 Dec 2012, 00:26)</p>
