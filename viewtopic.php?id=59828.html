					<p>HI there,</p><p>After a long period with DD-WRT I decided to give a try to OpenWRT because I needed the freeradius and the latest CoovaChilli packages for my public hotspot. <br />I reverted to stock firmware, upgraded to the latest revision and then installed OpenWRT 14.07. <br />After playing around I decided to back to DD-WRT passing again trough the stock firmware, <br />Don&#039;t get me wrong but complexity of OpenWRT is not my target: I need a simple GUI without set script or conf file manually because I&#039;m not the only one managing it.</p><p>I prepared a firmware without boot partition as wrote on wiki here:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.uninstall">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.uninstall</a></p><p>and fire it up trough ssh. Problem is I&#039;ve uploaded the wrong version! I forgot to rename the bin and I&#039;ve uploaded the stock firmware with boot partition...<br />Now my router power up and all front leds exluding the 5ghz indicator and including the back usb lights are blinking simultaneously. No lan/wan or wifi. Under Ubuntu I can&#039;t enter the router with Tftp or in failsafe mode as described here</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300#failsafe_mode">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl- â€¦ lsafe_mode</a></p><p>The only thing I get is the steady wps led (the two arrows) and since I&#039;m not an expert I prefer not to mess with electronic like soldered serial/usb dongle. </p><p>Must I consider it dead or there is still a possibility to recover it?</p><p>Thanks and have mercy, sometimes happens to make stupid mistakes...</p><p>EDIT: Seems TP-lINK recovery is still there:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>effe@Divina-Server:~$ sudo tcpdump -ni eth0 arp

					<p>That means you overwrote the ART partition, which contains (well, contained) among other device specific settings the calibration data for your wlan cards. This calibration data is unique to your device (or at least small production batches) and can&#039;t be recovered (unless you took a backup before your accident). Without it, at least the wlan cards won&#039;t work anymore.</p>									</div>

					<p>whell.. you should be able to enter bootloader console.. the one with fast &#039;tpl&#039; over TTL serial adapter as you didnt overwrite bootloader and do a tftp flash procedure</p><p>if you cant you can build a SPI interface or go to a gsm repair shop and tell them to reflash it.. as you have a nor flash</p><p>also you might be overwritten art partition.. so you also need a dump from someone wishful to share his delicate wifi calibration.. </p><p>unless you regenerate art.. you shouldnt have any wifi</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makarel</strong> on 23 Sep 2015, 05:03)</p>

					<p>Oh well... Seems today was a lucky one. I was able to flash a bin without boot partition using TFTP. Guess what? It worked and I&#039;m using it right now! But not after several attempts. I&#039;ve then upgraded to the last firmware, check all was running fine (except for the 5Ghz band becausemy phone doesn&#039;t have it) and then back to DD-WRT. <br />OpenWRT is a very good piece of software, but lacks a friendly user management. I think I&#039;ll give it a try on my old dir-300 just so see if I can get a radius/CoovaChilli running,in the end was the reason I started to play with OpenWRT. Thanks both for the help, next time I&#039;ll do a full backup before starting to play with OpenWRT.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>EffE</strong> on 23 Sep 2015, 16:19)</p>
