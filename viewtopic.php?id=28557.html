					<p>Hi,</p><p>as OpenWRT does not give me enough freedom right now I am trying to set up a debian system. <br />As far as services goes, everything is okay but I cannot get it to route through my PPPoE conenction.<br />Has anyone tried getting parts of openwrt working in debian? Or at least anything similar?<br />With best regards</p><br /><br /><p>p90</p>									</div>

					<p>I think you&#039;ll have better luck working within Debian -- there are lots of resources for help (wiki, IRC, mailing lists).&nbsp; The OpenWrt approach is different enough (configuration files, libc, packaging, etc.) that it would be a lot of effort and you&#039;d have no community support.</p><p>I used to use a Debian box as a router before I switched to OpenWrt, so if I can help feel free to PM me.</p>									</div>

					<p>I had a routersetup with pppoe on a debian years ago. I used shorewall as firewall and dnsmasq as dhcp- and dns-server. there are really good examples and howtos for shorewall, so setting it up shouldn&#039;t be a big problem</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 11 Feb 2011, 12:17)</p>
