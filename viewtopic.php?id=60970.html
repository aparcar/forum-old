					<p>babeld is an route manager. that automatize the creation of best routes. based in ping, speed, interfaces, etc It make the routes have not loops, optimize the routes and save,,, if a link interface is starving.... ( your case with wifi ) its automatic make the trafic bandwidth to go fine even more in my case.... it is easy to config you install and edit /etc/config/babeld and put the interfaces you want to create routes.... babeld admin all routes for you</p><p>in my case I have 3 wan interfaces: wan, wan2 and wan3&nbsp; before install babeld&nbsp; i have nice&nbsp; working wan and wan2&nbsp; but wan3 even when have lot of bandwidth it bareley used it.... I have like 9 mbps down and 3 mbps up..... after babeld and add the interfaces&nbsp; wan=eth0.2&nbsp; wan2 =eth0.200 and wan3 = eth0.300&nbsp; &nbsp; the wan3 increase the bandwidth used and the total three gives me 18mbps down and 5 mbps up...... it does some kind&nbsp; of homing.....it adds the bandwidth........</p><p>babeld is more specific to wireless interfaces (your case )&nbsp; but works fine with wired interfaces too</p><p>hope this help you</p><p>by the way babeld is tiny.... like 30kb</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>inquba</strong> on 17 Nov 2015, 23:49)</p>

					<p>Hi.</p><p>This is the output from the installation:</p><br /><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/overlay/usr/lib/opkg# opkg install babeld

					<p>Ohhh. Try to change to 20Mhz,&nbsp; and maybe erase wireless config an issue a command &quot;wifi detect&quot;&nbsp; then&nbsp; &quot;wifi detect &gt;&gt; /etc/config/wireless &quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; then reboot</p><p>Based on Nixor IDS: Wireless Adapter TL-WN7200ND with Kismet and OpenWRT Router TL-WDR4300 <a href="http://nixorids.blogspot.mx/2013/03/wireless-adapter-tl-wn7200nd-with.html?m=1">http://nixorids.blogspot.mx/2013/03/wir â€¦ h.html?m=1</a></p><br /><p>NOTE: I think the problem is the E900 with ddwrt as you said you connect to it via wifi. I would do a hard reset to ddwrt 30/30/30 reset.&nbsp; &nbsp;Click the reset button for 30 sec, then disconnect power for 30 sec then power on and still for other 30. I think the ddwrt firewall for wifi is somehow messed.... Try that</p><p>If after reset. the problem persist.... maybe it is because&nbsp; your router is multi-band and is ac&nbsp; 2.4Ghz/5Ghz and because you upgrade to DDWRT and ac drivers for the wireless are propietary... then the problem is the compatibility with ac</p><p>I have a buffalo 1750dhp and have low range in wifi.... after convert to openwrt 15.05&nbsp; my ac antennas drop so I dont use the internal antennas and use a dumb AP instead.....</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>inquba</strong> on 18 Nov 2015, 21:28)</p>
