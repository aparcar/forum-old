					<p>Hi all!</p><p>Just so you know what I&#039;m running:</p><p>Linksys WRT1900AC V1 - Just upgraded to OpenWRT&nbsp; 15.05 (the latest recommended for this model)<br />PureVPN </p><p>So I&#039;ve had this router since October and wasn&#039;t aware of OpenWrt as an alternative firmware as I previously used dd-wrt on my previous router and that&#039;s all I knew. For those that have used this router in it&#039;s factory state, it is very lacking in terms of customization. I&#039;ve sat here tonight configuring my router with OpenWrt and love it thus far! </p><p>My problem is that I came across a deal for PureVPN today and jumped on it for the price (5 years for $69.99) and cant seem to get it working. I&#039;m familiar enough with Linux to navigate and do some basic stuff and I&#039;m doing my best to learn more but I could use some help on this. I work on SonicWALLs primarily at work and they&#039;re pretty much all GUI based so I&#039;ve become somewhat lazy in the command line business. </p><p>So far, I&#039;ve installed the following packages:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>kmod-nf-nathelper <br />kmod-pptp<br />openvpn-openssl<br />luci-app-openvpn</p></blockquote></div><p>I&#039;ve setup an interface called tun0 and it is binded to the WAN interface. I don&#039;t think this is correct and I&#039;ve gone back and forth but this is where it&#039;s at currently. </p><p>I have the key and certificate authority files from PureVPN as well as all of their config files for their servers. I wasn&#039;t sure if I&#039;m supposed to upload the folders with all of those configs for TCP and UDP or what. </p><p>I&#039;m unsure on whether or not I have to do any of this via a terminal (using putty) or if I can do it all through the Luci app?<br />I attempted to setup a connection using the following info and doing my best to input those settings via the openvpn gui on the router. </p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>client<br />dev tun<br />proto udp<br />remote ch1-ovpn-udp.purevpn.net 53<br />persist-key<br />persist-tun<br />ca ca.crt<br />tls-auth Wdc.key 1<br />cipher AES-256-CBC<br />comp-lzo<br />verb 1<br />mute 20<br />route-method exe<br />route-delay 2<br />route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0<br />auth-user-pass<br />auth-retry interact<br />explicit-exit-notify 2<br />ifconfig-nowarn<br />auth-nocache</p></blockquote></div><p>But whenever I go to start the connection for the vpn it just sits there.</p><p>I&#039;ve looked through OpenWRTs tutorials but I need someone who has done this with PureVPN who can at least give me an outline on how to accomplish this.</p><p><strong>TL;DR&nbsp; - HOW DO I SETUP PUREVPN ON OPENWRT?</strong></p><p><img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Shel2theBurne</strong> on 18 Mar 2016, 04:18)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m pretty sure you&#039;ve got the exact problem that I had.&nbsp; I was going crazy.&nbsp; I created interface &quot;tun1&quot; but in my openvpn config I was using &quot;dev tun&quot;</p><p>The interface name has to match the &quot;dev&quot; exactly.&nbsp; I changed my statement to &quot;option dev tun1&quot; and everything started working.</p>									</div>
