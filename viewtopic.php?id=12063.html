					<p>I want to use a Linksys WRTSL54GS with OpenWRT on it to play back a music stream and not as an access point.&nbsp; Since I&#039;m still learning wifi and OpenWRT, do I have to do anything special with this router since it won&#039;t have a cable connection and will be joining a network instead of acting as an AP?&nbsp; (I&#039;ve already asked and received answers on using it for music playback, so that shouldn&#039;t be difficult to handle.)</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>I just played with this yesterday and it was pretty easy. if you have the X-wrt&nbsp; web interface installed.</p><p>Under Networks-&gt;wireless&nbsp; you can set the mode to &#039;client&#039;&nbsp; and enter the ssid of the access point.<br />Also select &#039;wan&#039; (I forget the field name) <br />My test system was open so I didn&#039;t need any passcodes but there is a spot for selecting that as well.<br />Save and apply the changes.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>You may need to reboot the openwrt system to get it to give your host pc the default route and dns<br />entries (I did).</p>									</div>
