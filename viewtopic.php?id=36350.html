					<p>I have tl-wr1043nd running Gargoyle 1.5.4. It is connected to ADSL modem and using PPPoE connection setting. My internet connection speed is not constant, for a nighttime it switches to a higher speed. I am experiencing some problems with QOS, because I must change bandwidth setting manually every time when speed changes. ADSL modem provides it&#039;s connection speed through Web UI. So I thought that I can make some script that will get correct settings from ADLS modem UI and automatically set it to QOS every time when connection established. The problem is that I am not very experienced and I don&#039;t know where to put such a script. I know that it will use wget and some parsing routine, and then commit<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/etc/init.d/qos_gargoyle stop
uci set qos_gargoyle.@download[0].total_bandwidth=&#039;115&#039;
