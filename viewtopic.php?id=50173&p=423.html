					<p>Hello, total noob here.</p><p>I have 3 internet connections in house. I have wrt1900ac v1 on my PC. Other 2 connections are wireless. My PC connection is not working properly lately because of service provider. Is there an *easy* way (or a guide) to set up OpenWRT when PPPoE exists to use it, otherwise connect another WiFi network when PPPoE dropped and serve it to LAN?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>barisahmet</strong> on 30 Mar 2016, 18:00)</p>
