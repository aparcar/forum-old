					<p>Saw this report <a href="http://www.ip-address-lookup-v4.com/article/smartphonewifi.php">http://www.ip-address-lookup-v4.com/art â€¦ newifi.php</a> and was wondering if there is a way to encrypt my traffic from smartphone (android of course). So even if I connect on a hi-jacked wifi spot they will not be able to see the sites which I am trying to visit?</p><p>They are also saying that the crooks are able to see which passwords I&#039;m typing in. Is there a way to block it as well? Normally the password boxes should be encrypted and protected if I&#039;m not mistaken.</p><p>Thank you</p>									</div>

					<p>You could use a VPN or SSH tunnel from your android phone to for example a wifi-router with OpenWrt firmware installed. Install a OpenVPN server on the router (or any computer which is on 24/7), and install a VPN client program on your smartphone, and make a VPN connection when using open wifi hotspots. A SSH tunnel might be easier to set up than VPN.</p>									</div>
