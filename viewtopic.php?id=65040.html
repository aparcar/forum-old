					<p>Hi guys, I just signed up for PIA and it&#039;s amazing all this time I was thinking VPNs are really not for me because of latency and torrent stuff. WRONG. I am on OPTIMUM 50/25 network and using auto settings I went from 11ms latency to 12 and speeds are same according to speedtest.net So I am happy in that perspective.</p><p>Now quick question. Instead of putting software on all devices (my computer, my phone, my tablet) separately I am thinking to configure my router to use PIA service on router level so all my connections already on VPN without even putting any software. I looked up some guides and I do see guides for OPENVPN and I also see guide on PIA website on how to configure DD-WRT. Can you point me to the right direction in terms of what works best for PIA + OpenWRT. May be there is some package available that will pre configure router to use PIA and all I have to do is put username and password <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>Thank you !</p><p>Here is what I have found:</p><p><a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/client-support/dd-wrt-openvpn">https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/p … rt-openvpn</a></p><p><a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/forum/discussion/3519/openwrt-router-config-for-always-up-vpn-with-pia">https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/f … n-with-pia</a></p>									</div>

					<p>with that internet connection speed you had, you will need a beefy router for that, preferably a x86 machine. Afaik,there&#039;s a little (you can say it, there&#039;s none) of the consumer grade SOHO routers (even a overclocked 1.4ghz r7000) is capable of getting &gt;50mbit throughput for OpenVPN.</p><p>In my case I had a OpenVPN and a server grade 8core atom ITX board from supermicro, with pure software mode, with all cores, I can manage to get a NAT speed of 120mbit/sec, with AES-NI I can get as high as 800-900mbit/sec. Luckily OpenWRT now supports AES-NI so you can just buy a x86 motherboard that supports such function.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>remlei</strong> on 23 May 2016, 00:56)</p>

					<p>Quick question. MAy be it&#039;s too specific but I&#039;d think one of the most liked VPN services + one of the best software for router is a win win. So the question is this. MAy be there is a WRT1900AC OpenWRT Build available with pre installed PIA service ? Like all settings are there all you have to do is put your username and password ?</p>									</div>

					<p>You can build it yourself with the image builder. Just include your /etc/openvpn/pia-* files along with the script above (saved as /etc/uci-defaults/99-piasetup). While you&#039;re at it, you can also set up your wireless to the channels/passwords of your liking.</p>									</div>
