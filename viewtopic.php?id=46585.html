					<p>Hiya, So I&#039;ve got a few questions. </p><p>First off, I&#039;ve got openwrt Barrier Breaker (i believe) up on my TP-Link TL-MR3040, with LuCI installed. I was looking at scripts to&nbsp; utilise the hardware switch, but they required kmod-button-hotplug... which I can&#039;t install due to kernel dependency issues. Is kmod-gpio-button-hotplug the same thing and will it cover the switch? </p><p>Second, I&#039;d like just a basic set of instructions on how to Utilise the ethernet port as WAN and turn my MR3040 into a basic router. How would I go abut doing this via... LuCI? A script that I can attach to the hardware switch? Please let me know.</p>									</div>
