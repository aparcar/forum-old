					<p>As far as I understand it, there mut be one authenticator and one or more supplicants. But what happens, if one of the supplicants does not have direct WLAN contact to the authenticator?

					<p>My problem is that my present wlan network is based on WPA2 and I don&#039;t want to go to every user and change everything... <br />Now I want to connect some remote wired LAN to my network, but it is impossible with WPA2, so I decided to use WPA2 for wlan clients and WPA for WDS, but when I set &#039;psk psk2&#039; on main AP and &#039;psk&#039; on remote one the WDS don&#039;t work...(works only when &#039;psk&#039; are on both sides).<br />I read somewere on this forum that it is possible to set separated settings for wlan clients and WDS (akm,crypto and even password!) by wl0_wds_***** nvrams. Is that true?</p><p>I tried client bridge too but it has some disadvantages: every wired client from remote LAN is seen as the same MAC adress...Client bridge mode is more suitable for my purposes because there is no wireless client which connects to second AP, but it isn&#039;t real transparent bridge...(correct if I&#039;m wrong).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Marek</strong> on 1 May 2006, 23:56)</p>
