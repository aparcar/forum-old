					<p>Hello,<br />I just would like to understand the state of OpenWrt development on Meraki-mini.</p><p>According to <a href="http://toh.openwrt.org">http://toh.openwrt.org</a>/, Meraki-mini now totally supports Kamikaze and so is totally merged on OpenWrt project.</p><p>The official site seems to have a totally different opinion. It provides an its own forked version of OpenWrt (2.0) saying &quot;Please note that custom firmware images are not supported by Meraki and may put your device in a non-working state. Devices with custom firmware images are not covered under the limited warranty.&quot;.</p><p>Is there anyone who has successfully tried OpenWrt on the Meraki-mini and can answer to my questions? In case of device bricked, how can I recover my firmware?</p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>I just read this document: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Meraki/Mini">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har â€¦ eraki/Mini</a> and made a generic idea.<br />Are there some things I would have to make particular attention of during the installation of OpenWrt?</p>									</div>

					<p>I have experienced both WhiteRussian and Kamikaze, so I know the differences.<br />It&#039;s enough for me if Kamikaze works correctly on the device. I hope many system issues will be fixed on next 7.07.<br />Thanks for the hint about Ap51 Easyflash.

					<p>Hi, I&#039;m working with the meraki mini and I&#039;m trying to make persistent a file configuration in /etc/init.d/ so I can make some changes in the wireless configuration..does anyone know how to do it?? I know that in /storage/ files are persistent.. but i need to put it in /etc/init.d/....<br />I really don&#039;t want to change the firmware to kamikaze because it isn&#039;t as stable as I need... (I&#039;ve already tried)<br />Please, any idea let me know! If I&#039;m in the wrong post also let me know! jaja<br />thank you very much!</p>									</div>
