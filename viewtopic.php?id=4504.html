					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have an ASUS wl-500gx at a remote location, with a somewhat unstable connection to an ADSL modem.&nbsp; I therefore power cycle the router twice a day to make sure that the link is available for as long a time as possible.&nbsp; Each time the router boots it runs inadyn to update its external dynamic IP address at DynDNS.com.&nbsp; The IP address seldom changes during these power cycles, and consequently I have received an e-mail from DynDNS informing me that my account has been shut down because of excessive updates of the same IP address.&nbsp; I therefore need to remember what IP address or had tried to rebooting to determine whether it is necessary to try to update with a new address.</p><p>As I am not too comfortable with linux scripting I thought perhaps some of you might have had the same problem and come up with an easy solution?</p>									</div>
