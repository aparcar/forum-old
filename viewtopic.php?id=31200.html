					<p>Hi there,</p><p>I have some newbie questions regarding the antenna mod on the WNDR3700 router; maybe you can help me sort something out in my head.</p><p>If I may be allowed to shoot them..here it goes:</p><p>The WNDR3700 has by default 8 internal antennas, 4 for 2.4 ghz circuit, 4 for 5 ghz if I understood correctly.<br />Now the antenna mod add 4 external antennas and I guess disables the 8 internal ones.<br />This means that we are left with 2 antennas for 2.4 ghz and 2 for 5 ghz.<br />Now, in MIMO we have one spatial stream going out over 1 antenna.<br />This means that the maximum theoretical transfer rate is achieved over 4 spatial streams and 4 antennas.</p><p>1) Am I correct ?</p><p>2) Why would it then be feasible to replace the 4 antennas (4 spatial streams) of the 5 Ghz circuit and a maximum theoretical bw of 600 mbps for 2 external antennas and a maximum theoretical bw of 300 mbps ?<br />Is the range better with the external antennas ? (I&#039;ve read an article which claimed the internal antennas are better regarding noise isolation and range for MIMO; don&#039;t know if the article was correct)</p><p>Thanks in advance and hope you can clear up my dilemmas.</p>									</div>

					<p>janptak, just ignore the malicious comments. there will always be people like that with low people and social skills <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>from what I could find out on my own&nbsp; (and it might possibly be wrong):</p><p>MIMO support is implemented only for a max of 2 streams although the WNDR3700 has that many antennas ( 4 x 2.4ghz, 4 x 5ghz); for MIMO support to be 3 or 4 stream enabled, just a firmware update is not all that is needed (seems that the hardware must also catch up).</p><p>So in my opinion and after also going on Netgear&#039;s site, I would say that initially you have:<br />4 x 2.4 ghz antennas - &gt; max 2 are chosen to be used in MIMO and the router chooses the best one(ones) signal wise for TX/RX toward you<br />4 x 5 ghz antennas -&gt; same stuff as for 2.4 ghz</p><p>So probably if you replace those 4 internal antennas for let&#039;s say the 2.4 ghz chip, with 2 external antennas, then you would still get MIMO 2 streams, the only difference being there would be no selection of which antenna to use regarding signal quality for communicating with you.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>skyraven</strong> on 11 Aug 2011, 11:34)</p>

And one is that we don&#039;t make multiple posts of the same topic or try to get attention on our posts in a short period of time. If someone is able to help, that person will do so. It&#039;s all mentioned in the link I posted, so I will wrap up here.<br />But I&#039;m glad to see that you&#039;ve got progress on your own. I know pretty good how it feels, since the few questions I asked in this forum finally got solved by me as well.</p>									</div>

					<p>Point taken.<br />Sorry from my part.<br />I think this was a good exercise <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> in the end by putting together dispersed info all over the place I was able to reach a conclusion and now I&#039;m waiting for my WNDR3700 to arrive so that I can play with it.</p>									</div>
