					<p>I have an older PC lying around that I figure I might reuse as a router. It&#039;s an early 2000s AMD K7-based motherboard with two IDE slots, USB support and no SATA ports.</p><p>So I downloaded the most recent 14.07 combined generic image, wrote it to an old 4.3 GB IDE HD and ... it hung at &quot;waiting for /dev/sda2&quot;.</p><p>I tried again with 12.09 with the same result.</p><p>After that I did some searching and it seems that an ide module is missing from the default images (why this would be the case for an x86 image seems odd to me, but no matter), so I would have to compile a custom image with the ide module included.</p><p>I did that and included a few others (like cifs)... and once again it hung at waiting for /dev/sda2. I even tried an iso and that time it hung waiting for /dev/sr0.</p><p>Then I went through the the kernel config options (i.e. make kernel_menuconfig) and enabled all manner of PATA options (Device Drivers ---&gt; Serial ATA and Parallel ATA drivers ---&gt;) and still no joy.</p><p>So has anyone managed to do this and if so, what compile options or configuration was used?</p>									</div>

					<p>Apparently the solution to all this is mind numbingly simple:</p><p>It&#039;s in the Grub configuration: just edit it to remove the console entries. No custom compile, no adding this or that, just remove part of the default boot line in Grub.</p><p>Unfortunately, the boot hung at the next step: &quot;Switching to clocksource tsc&quot;</p>									</div>

					<p>That is certainly the impression I got from my readings and searching on the issue, hence my initial question about just what to include in a custom compile.</p><p>However, given that changing the default grub config (either at the Grub command line or in /boot/grub/grub.cfg) from:</p><p>menuentry &quot;OpenWrt&quot; {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; linux /boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/sda2 rootfstype=ext4 rootwait console=tty0 console=ttyS0,38400n8 noinitrd<br />}</p><p>to </p><p>menuentry &quot;OpenWrt&quot; {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; linux /boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/sda2 rootfstype=ext4 rootwait noinitrd<br />}</p><p>seems to allow for it to pass the hang up at &quot;waiting for /dev/sda2&quot;, I&#039;m going to guess that some kind of IDE support is being enabled somehow.</p>									</div>
