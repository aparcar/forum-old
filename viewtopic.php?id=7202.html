					<p>Hi, everyone, I&#039;m interestend in running openwrt on this model of belkin AP, but I&#039;ve not found any good hint on existing posts, anyone having success on this? I also open the 7130 to change the integrated antenna with 2 sma-rp connector for using external antenna, you think some photos of the inside can be useful to determinate the amount of ram or chip type? thank all, bye</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m really interested in your results!! What kind of 7130 do you have? Mine is is v1000 and am&nbsp; really looking forward to use openwrt on it! But because it&#039;s our only uplink for&nbsp; internet i don&#039;t dare&nbsp; to gamble&nbsp; with it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> So please let&nbsp; me know how it went! BTW I from&nbsp; my research&nbsp; (yes i been thinking quite long about flashing it) You should use openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx&nbsp; if it&#039;s pre&nbsp; v1444. otherwise you&nbsp; will&nbsp; only have 2mb flash and thats to little! One note you can look for flash results of f5d7230 thats the&nbsp; same + extra switch chip al the rest is the same.&nbsp; </p><p>good luck!</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m still reading the documentation, but I can&#039;t find any good hint to help. Botton of the AP say it&#039;s a f5d7130A ver2114ef, but the latest firmware say it&#039;s a 7230, inside there is a broadcom mini-pci and no other label to identify the amount of ram or flash, I will post here the result, I think openwrt-brcm in trx format it&#039;s the right one.</p>									</div>

					<p>I was able to upload the micro version of openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx, after that I got power and lan leds on, but no response from the AP, I wasn&#039;t able to understand what IP it got after the flashing couse I&#039;ve got no response from any IP, I also try with nmap to find where is it, but without luck. I was thinking that if the original firmware is 2.67mb size it must be possible to upload openwrt, am I wrong?</p>									</div>

					<p>(Take this with a grain of salt:) Jaco- if you are trying to recover from this, you could try doing:</p><p>arping &lt;original IP of belkin&gt;</p><p>and doing a manual reboot (pull plug and reinsert).&nbsp; If you see a ping answer, then it should be possible to reflash with a tftp put &lt;orig. firmware&gt; with tftp set with rexmt=1.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve already reflashed with the original firmware from belkin, and now it&#039;s all normal, the problem is that when i put in the openwrt firm the AP seems to work, but I cant figure out what IP it take, I wonder if the boot can&#039;t complete for some reason and then it can&#039;t be accessed via LAN</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry it&#039;s an old thread, but thought my experiences were relevant to this one.</p><p>I&#039;ve a F5D7130 v1010.</p><p>Initially I thought I&#039;d bricked it, but managed to flash it with belkin 7230 firmware, and then micro version of dd-wrt, and use it&#039;s factory reset option to clear the nvram.&nbsp; Not sure if that actually helped, as I couldn&#039;t get into dd-wrt after that!</p><p>However, managed to flash to micro version of openwrt - openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx -</p><p>All flash attempts succedded by using tftp:<br />(windows: run ping -t -w 10 192.168.1.1 already running in one window, have tftp -i 192.168.1.1 PUT openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx ready in another, power up router, hir return on 2nd window as soon as you get first reply.)</p><p>info in dmesg seems to imply i&#039;ve got 16MB RAM and 4MB flash, which ought to be enough for full version of OpenWRT however that doesn&#039;t seem to work - no response to pings or any other life.&nbsp; Managed to flash back to micro openwrt after that attempt, though.</p>									</div>
