					<p>hi, guys!<br />i have a 3420 v1.2 (spansion flash)... actually there is currently no flash chip @ all and on top of that, the soldering points on the pcb are ripped off. pretty dull, but i still have some hope left, cause around the flash chip, there are 16 more solder points (8 on each side), just waiting to be used. prob is, i don&#039;t know which ones should i use with the spare cfeon i got cheap shipped from china... so if someone has the 3420 and is willing to take it apart and find out which of the contacts are the right ones, i will be more that thankful!!!<br />sorry for wring here, couldn&#039;t figure out how to open an new thread. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> ...i&#039;m new here, you know...</p>									</div>

					<p>I have very strange problem with my TL-MR3420 V1.2. </p><p>The problem is that GND and TX are shorted somehow. I&#039;ve already remove C496 and test with ohmmeter between GND and TX and there is a continuity. I tested directly to processor and again there is a continuity between this pins. Seems, that R612 is connected to the GND pin, not to RX. Please help me to fix it if possible.</p>									</div>
