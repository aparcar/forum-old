					<p>Hello together, </p><p>my ISP provided the WLAN-router model <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/arcadyan/arv7506">Arcadyan ARV7506PW11</a> which is a big piece of hardware pestilence (starting with the fact that it only accepts login via Internet Explorer). I tried to flash OpenWRT some months ago but the Wiki doesn&#039;t seem to provide a beginner friendly working version.</p><p>Recently I got a <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd">TP-Link TL-WR841ND</a>. Installation procedure of <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr841n-v8-squashfs-factory.bin">OpenWRT 14.07</a> was easy this time and some minutes later I was overstrained by all the options provided by OpenWRT. I expected something like this and this is not the problem. <br />But I know from other open source projects that things can become really tricky and time intensive. So before I start &quot;rebuilding my network&quot; I just wanted to ask something important for me:</p><p>As far as I understood the <a href="http://www.tp-link.com/resources/document/TL-WR841ND_V9_User_Guide_1910010905.pdf">manual</a> the TP-Link has no modem. So I have to use the Arcadyan ARV7506PW11 as modem, isn&#039;t it? </p><p>If so: How does port forwarding procedure will look like? I have to set up some port forwardings for my home cloud. Supposed the setup of&nbsp; Arcadyan ARV7506PW11 + TL-WR841N works so far do I have to set every port forward twice? From Arcadyan to TP-LINK and from TP-LINK to the home cloud server?</p><p>Thank alot in advance!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>saljut7</strong> on 18 Jun 2015, 15:11)</p>

					<p>Yes, you need to continue using the Arcadyan as a modem; I see three options here:</p><p>1) You configure both the Arcadyan and the TP-Link as routers: you have the internet, an intermediate network, and an internal network, and thus need to forward ports twice.<br />2) You configure the Arcadyan as a bridge, and the TP-Link as a router: your TP-Link is effectively connected to the internet, and only need to forward ports there.<br />3) You configure the Arcadyan as a router, and the TP-Link as an access point: you only need to forward ports on the Arcadyan.</p><p>Now, the question is: considering that you still need to use the Arcadyan, how do you want to use the TP-Link?</p>									</div>

So 1 and 3 wouldn&#039;t solve the problem because I still have to access the Arcadyan (which is only possible with Internet Explorer for some reason).</p><p>Beside this 2 is anyway what I thought to do. The setting possibilities for the are quite rudimental. I&#039;ve never recognized some menu offering a &quot;bridge mode&quot;. Would you provide me some more information for what I have to look for to enable a bridge mode?</p>									</div>
