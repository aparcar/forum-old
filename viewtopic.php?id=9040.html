					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I would like to open a thread dedicated to collecting enhancements for the USR5461 GPL firmware. What have people developed so far? Are there any website dedicated to USR5461 firmware enhancements?</p><p>I&#039;m especially interested in adding support for USB network storage. I want to connect my USB harddisc to the USR5461 USB port, so that I can access it from all Windows PCs over WLAN. I haven&#039;t look into the source code of the USR5461 so far, but it should be possible to add samba support. Anyone tried that?</p>									</div>
