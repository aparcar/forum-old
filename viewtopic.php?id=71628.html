					<p>Actually, I have a br-lan and br-vwifi (associated&nbsp; to virtual ssid) and my WAN interface is eth2 (HiLink lte modem). I apply the sqm to the eth2 interface and I checked than setting in Download and Upload speed is OK when you use speedtest.net.<br />I applied to bridge interface because I want to limit bandwitdh in the lan of virtual ssid (br-vwifi) so when I put speed value download and upload are working in inverse order. In this point I dont understand WHY, why my sqm download speed is the upload speed in speedtest.net and upload speed in sqm is download speed in speedtest.net</p><p>Also I remember than when I apply the sqm to WAN interface it works worse than in br-lan.

					<p>I presume you run the speed test from a client computer that is connected to the br-lan? If so, then your result does make sense, even though the situation is somewhat strange. The SQM speeds are always from the perspective of the router.</p><p>For WAN-side, download is fetching from Internet, and upload is sending to Internet. For LAN-side, download is receiving from LAN, and upload is sending to LAN. And you&#039;ve set the maximum speed to send into LAN to 5 Mb/s. All packets go through your router.</p><p>Thus, you are capping the maximum speed that your router is sending data to br-lan, even though it might receive it faster from the Internet.</p>									</div>

					<p>The problem is that the situation is slightly more complex than users really want to spend time on thinking through, so for the GUI sqm opted for the simple (but not gernerically correct) monikers &quot;Download speed&quot; and &quot;upload speed&quot; instead of the more correct &quot;ingess&quot; and &quot;egress&quot; (though these are mentioned in parentheses). This was done under the asumption that novice users would most likely just use one sqm instante on the WAN interface and be done with... For more advanced users the sqm documentation at <a href="https://lede-project.org/docs/howto/sqm">https://lede-project.org/docs/howto/sqm</a> left some &quot;bread crumbs&quot; in the last bullet point: &quot;This discussion assumes SQM is instantiated on an interface that directly faces the internet/WAN. If it is not (e.g., on a LAN port) the meaning of ingress/egress flips. In that case, specify egress queueing disciplines as nat dual-dsthost and the ingress one as nat dual-srchost.&quot;...<br />I still believe the GUI makes the right choice, as the alternative would be to scare away too many users by having the required initial learning curve being too steep...</p>									</div>

Since module autoloading does not seem to be robustly available at all sqm-script target systems, sqm scripts defaults to attempting to load modules for all required qdiscs. The error you see occurs if a module does not exist. sqm will later check whether the required qdiscs seem actually to be functional, which will catch the case where a qdisc does not exist as either built-in or module...</p><p>Hope that helps...</p>									</div>
