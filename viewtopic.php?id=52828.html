					<p>Hi all,</p><p>i have the following issue.</p><p>I&#039;ve got a docsis 3 modem with router built-in from my ISP</p><p>and i have a TL-wr1043nd v1 with barrierbreaker open-wrt</p><p>i also got 3 set-topboxes of my ISP to watch digital TV.</p><p>Now the problem is those 3 boxes need an direct link to the lan-ports of the modem/router, otherwise interactivity - EPG - activation nagravison, doesnt work properly. (router needs to see the mac-adress)</p><p>i have one plugged in directly into the modem/router due to that it&#039;s right next to the modem/router.</p><p>other one is connect via long cable with 2 switches inbetween with other devices so it&#039;s plugged into the wrt-router.</p><p>last one is connected via Powerline - but this also has other devices that require internet, thus currently plugged into the wrt-router.</p><p>i&#039;m now wondering, how can i connect those 2 set-topboxes via the open-wrt router ? </p><p>Diagram : <a href="http://www.gliffy.com/go/publish/image/6194462/L.png">http://www.gliffy.com/go/publish/image/6194462/L.png</a></p><p>Thanks in advance,</p><p>Xtremegamer</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, </p><p>Thanks for the reply,</p><p>altho i don&#039;t quite understand what you mean by &quot;static routes&quot;&nbsp; you mean setup a vlan ? i&#039;ve read something about switched port</p><p>also a switch is not an option since these set-top-boxes also have an DLNA client, where i would like to stream content to in the future.</p><p>is there a way to 1.) set route from lan to wan seperate from the router&#039;s wan 2.) still make them visible to the lan so that devices can still connect to them ?</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p><p>Xtremegamer</p>									</div>
