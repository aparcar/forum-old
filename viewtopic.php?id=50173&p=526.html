Flip the device over.
 
Step 2:
The model number can be found on the sticker underneath the device.  In the example below, the model number of the device is WRT54G.
 
NOTE:  For WRT1900AC, the model number is located on the front panel, below the Linksys logo.

					<p>My apologies if this has already been discussed, but I couldn&#039;t find it:&nbsp; in several places it is claimed that the Linksys WRT1900ACSV2 is the same hardware as the Linksys WRT1900ACS.&nbsp; I just got one of the former.&nbsp; A recent OpenWRT (well, technically LEDE) snapshot installed smoothly, but I am unable to control the radio power output.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried varying the radio power to settings between 2mW and 200mW and the WiFi signal monitor on my phone records the same (high) level no matter what I set it to.&nbsp; Is this an issue with the mwlwifi driver in general, or something specific to the WRT1900ACSV2 hardware?&nbsp; If the latter, is there hope of overcoming it or is this an instance of the manufacturer locking it down?&nbsp; If the latter, I will probably ask for my money back for this &quot;open source ready&quot; router.</p><p>Thanks in advance for any information you can provide.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello community<br />After waiting couple of months for a proper and usable openwrt/lede firmware for TP-Link Archer C2600 and not finding any, I now decided to get a Linksys WRT1900ACS instead which has a way bigger community and the vendor acknowledges and even advertises the router as being openwrt compatible.<br />From what i understood, the hardwares between V1 and V2 of this model, are exactly the same and the only difference is the wifi driver and location of power tables which is apparently more restrict in V2 to comply with FCC regulations.</p><p>Is that correct? and if could get either, I&#039;m assuming V1 is the preferred one, right?</p>									</div>
