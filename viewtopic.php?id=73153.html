					<p>Dear All,</p><p>I want to do some modifications to the ethernet drivers, i.e., ag71xx, which is a built-in kernel module. It is included in the modules.builtin file.</p><p>Can anyone tell me that how to define one kernel module as built-in module but not loadable kernel module in OpenWRT?</p><p>Another question is that, can the built-in module call functions from a loadable kernel module? The built-in moudle is always in the kernel but the loadable kernel module may be not, that&#039;s my concern. </p><p>Thanks in advance.</p><p>Alex</p>									</div>
