					<p>Hello I am currently using a wndr3700 router on stock firmware 1.0.4.75 on shaw (Canada) I was wondering if it would be a good idea to switch to openwrt and add ipv6 functionality?&nbsp; I know my ISP support ipv6 and was wondering if there is any benefits enabling ipv6?&nbsp; secondly how is the wireless performance with the latest builds are they are good as stock?&nbsp; lastly if there is a benefit to enabling ipv6 could you direct me to an install guide for native support of ipv6 and how to install the firewall.</p><p>thanks for all your help <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>You sure Shaw is &quot;supporting&quot; IPv6?<br /><a href="http://www.laslow.net/2010/07/25/the-non-existent-state-of-ipv6-in-canada/">http://www.laslow.net/2010/07/25/the-no â€¦ in-canada/</a></p><p>If it&#039;s true, then that&#039;s amazing, but otherwise you could set up a tunnel to Hurricane Electric, SixXS, etc.<br />You don&#039;t necessarily need IPv6 (even post v4 exhaustion), but it&#039;s definitely beneficial to learn, especially from a security standpoint.</p><p>I found the following threads (and wiki links within) to be very helpful:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=26764">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=26764</a><br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=25465">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=25465</a><br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27541">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27541</a></p><p>EDIT: sorry, I can&#039;t answer your wifi questions.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>KillaB</strong> on 16 Dec 2010, 23:24)</p>

					<p>I was told that the package I&#039;m on has ipv6 shaw High-Speed Nitro (100 Mbps down and 5 Mbps up) <br />I was wondering if there would be a benefit for sites like youtube which I hear has ipv6 support now <br />(like a speed increase or something beneficial).

					<p>Interesting. Shaw must be experimenting with a smaller audience (DOCSIS 3.0 customers) to start.<br />I&#039;m with Telus and patiently waiting for a proper dual-stack.</p><p>As for IPv6 being faster? The difference *if any* should be pretty negligible to the end user. It really can go both ways since the routing path is likely to be much different at this stage of the game.</p>									</div>

					<p>with all my&nbsp; experience,&nbsp; IPv6 does not give us speed benefit.. especially when we are using tunneling methods etc., and then again less a single digit percentage of web was IPv6 enabled last when I checked for stats, Its just so that we are ready for the near tomorrow which is bound to come, unavoidable. </p><p>Then again so many websites are in accessible depending upon your service provider. so all in all IPv6 world is not mature/ enough (not by technology but by no of routers and other ). Lets say like ipv6.xyz.com is not accessible when using abc provider, while its accessible by using efg&nbsp; provider.&nbsp; Most of the old proprietary&nbsp; tools dont know whats IPv6 which irritates you further, but all this will slowly heal with time</p><p>now about accessing IPv6, you need to check in your area if your ISP provides IPv6 if it does not go for a tunnel broker.<br />start with wikipedia for IPV6, read about 6rd,ds-lite, softwire, 6to4, 4to6, bla bla bla......<br />Yes openwrt would benefit you on using IPv6 over OEM firmware as it just opens up all the possibilities</p><p>Source of information: I earn my bread by building firmwares for routers.<br />Some may not agree with what I said but its simply true for me.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mohnkhan</strong> on 17 Dec 2010, 08:14)</p>
