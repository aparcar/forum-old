					<p>good day,</p><p>we&#039;ve set up a linksys wrt54g router with dual wan and load balancing using openwrt (kamikaze). when one of the two links fails, it takes more than 2 minutes for the router to use the other live link.</p><p>Questions:</p><p>1. Is there any work around for this problem? it&#039;s going to be used in a production environment and 2minutes is just a bit too long.</p><p>2. If there isnt any solution for this problem, can anybody explain why it takes that long to determine/use the other live link? we need it for documentation purposes.</p><p>any inputs would be much appreciated. thank you in advance</p>									</div>
