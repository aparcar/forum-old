					<p>You may also want to read about <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Using">first logon</a></p><p>Anyway, if you did not set password then there is none. No default password exists to avoid people not changing the default. We assume no-one is naive enough to keep the box open without password. A tip: remember the password you set. The user is root.</p><p>And as stated, once you do set a password, the next logon will be SSH not telnet. Download and install <a href="http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty-0.60-installer.exe">PuTTY</a>. It is a well known client that can do both Telnet and SSH.</p><p>Set your password with the &quot;passwd&quot; command, and when that is done, update the package list with the &quot;ipkg update&quot; command. Then finally install the WebifÂ² package with the command shown earlier. After that, you have a GUI again. All basic WiFi router config can be done through the GUI, however, if you really want to unlock the power of OpenWRT, you need to keep PuTTY/SSH handy as well.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cybermaus</strong> on 28 Aug 2007, 00:14)</p>

					<p>The article that goes with that image assumes you create a serial cable before you upload the image, and does everything from the console, including setting the password. So I guess you used an alternate method, like upgrade from the netgear&#039;s normal web GUI. </p><p>The article is dated August 2007, and mentions Kamikaze. So that is good. It is probably a 7.07 image.<br />Hopefully it is a stock image, otherwise, however unlikely, the password might indeed already be set, and you need to ask this David guy what the password is.</p><p>But before you do that, lets establish a few things: </p><p>- Did you indeed loaded the image through the Netgear GUI?</p><p>- How well are you with linux and bash? It may help if we know if you have a lot, a little, or no experience.</p><p>- Do you at all realize the normal linux administrator user is &#039;root&#039;, and therefore, if you specify root as user, than PuTTY may not ask for a password, and if it does, you may just be able to enter an empty password?</p><p>- You keep telling PuTTY and SSH asks for a user and password. Did you try telnet at all? I do not have any system around with an empty root password, so I do not know how PuTTY reacts to an empty password. But normal instruction is to use telnet on the first logon (see first logon link above)</p><p>- The article has a nice description on how to make a serial cable. However, not all Cell-phone-USB-serial cables have the same color wires. Are you sure you have the correct GND-RX-TX wires attached? Do you have any other equipment to test your serial cable?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cybermaus</strong> on 29 Aug 2007, 12:22)</p>

					<p>CHR57 - </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From the posts it looks like you are going back and forth about whether the router is really working.&nbsp; Kamakaze does work reliably on the 634U.&nbsp; However Kamakaze does not have a default Web interface so you will have to get used to command line linux to get anywhere with it.&nbsp; You can eventually install Webif^2 and that will make things easier, but you should master basic things first.&nbsp; You will need to read through the Wiki Documentation, as mentioned above particularly first logon.&nbsp; Much of the documentation refers to white russian and linksys WRT&#039;s.&nbsp; This is still a good introduction, but anytime a difference is mentioned with Kamakaze or the 634U they are definitive not the general documentation.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You do have to log in with telnet first, SSH (and PuTTy) do not work until after you have run the passwd command.&nbsp; After you run the passwd command telnet will not work.&nbsp; If your router is bricked (flashing kamakaze did not work), you will have to use the serial console, but this is very complicated and you do not want to use it until after you have determined that that the router is bricked.&nbsp; You really really do need the cell phone USB cable if you use the serial port. </p><p>You mentioned that DHCP and WAN work on your router.&nbsp; &nbsp;If this is true kamakaze is working and you can log in with telnet.&nbsp; But you need to make sure this is true.&nbsp; You could for example run nmap 192.168.1.1 and ports 23 and 53 should show up (telnet and DNS).&nbsp; You can also ping 192.168.1.1 and you should get a response.&nbsp; Nmap is a unix command and although versions exist for windows you won&#039;t already have it installed if you have windows. </p><p>If the router is really working telnet is dead simple and you should just connect to it, but you probably have to give more information about how you are connected to the router and what you have tried.&nbsp; One problem you might have is that you have a host computer with a network card set in a different subnet - i.e. 192.168.0.1 your host computer must be operating in the 192.168.1.1 subnet.&nbsp; You can set your host network card address manually and set it multiple host ip&#039;s.&nbsp; You can also set your host computer so that the network is connected directly to the router and not to any other computer and set your host computer to use DHCP.&nbsp; You may have done this if you know that DHCP and WAN are working.&nbsp; Another possible problem is that you have a firewall set to block telnet (even outgoing).&nbsp; You need to know what the firewall settings are or disable it while you are setting up the router.</p><p>Wireless does not work in the initial setup on the 634U - the configuration parameter is set to 0.&nbsp; This is in the /etc/config/wireless file.&nbsp; You can change it using vi to edit the file.&nbsp; Vi is a character mode full-screen editor which takes a little getting used to at first - you will need to read documentation.&nbsp; Vi is standard on linux systems - try man vi, but if you have Windows you will have to look on the internet for documentation (try google).</p><p>Again - first make sure you have some kind of network connection to the router and if you have any problem simplify your system so the only connection is between your host computer and the router.&nbsp; Try dhcp and then try manually configuring the network card.&nbsp; If you can get an active network connection then telnet should work- it will give you a banner and then a command line prompt.&nbsp; You can then display and make modifications in /etc and /etc/config.&nbsp; /etc/config/network sets the subnet and other things.&nbsp; /etc/config/wireless modifies the wireless setting.&nbsp; The command passwd will prompt you for a root password and will then enable ssh and disable telnet although telnet will work until you exit.&nbsp; When you use ssh you need to connect to root@192.168.1.1.&nbsp; In PuTTy make sure the user name is root (one of the data parameters in the configuration).</p><p>Once all of this works you can install Webif, but make sure you understand ipkg first and that you you use the kamakaze webif for your machine.</p><p>If you have bricked your router and need to use the serial console then read the documentation very carefully.&nbsp; One quirk of the 634U is that it only works with tftpd on the host machine not tfp.&nbsp; That is the daemon version of tfp not the client version.&nbsp; This means you will probably need a linux machine, although you can probably get tfpd for server versions of windows.&nbsp; The end user versions have tfp, not tfpd.&nbsp; You will need to read a lot of documentation to get tfpd flashing through the serial console working right.</p>									</div>
