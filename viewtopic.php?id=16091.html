					<p>Assuming it is of similar design to the USR6106 then it is a Broadcom 63xx based board. We do have a target that boots on the platform but vendors use binary drivers provided by Broadcom for ethernet, usb and dsl.&nbsp; Unless some open source drivers materialize in the future I would not expect the brcm63xx platform to become functional.</p><p>Short answer: No.&nbsp; &nbsp; Longer answer: Not currently, maybe some day provided usable drivers appear.</p>									</div>

					<p>I ask today Broadcom about this driver, here is the response:</p><p>--------------------------</p><p>Broadcom is currently evaluating our support strategy for Linux users. As the chipset supplier, Broadcom provides Linux support to our customers - the manufacturers of wireless devices - that ultimately provide products to end customers, such as wireless LAN vendors, cable modem vendors, and notebook providers. It is up to these manufacturers to provide Linux client support to their end customers. Broadcom does not make a Linux client version available for end users at this time, however this may change in the future. In the meantime, please contact the manufacturer of your wireless device for Linux drivers. Linux support for certain products may also be available from Linuxant, and third party provider at <a href="http://www.linuxant.com/driverloader/">http://www.linuxant.com/driverloader/</a></p><br /><br /><p>Regards,</p><p>Broadcom Support Team</p><p>---------------------------------</p><p>ps: nice info in this wiki link: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/BroadcomBCM63xxPort">http://wiki.openwrt.org/BroadcomBCM63xxPort</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zegames</strong> on 22 Jun 2008, 19:42)</p>
