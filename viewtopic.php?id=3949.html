					<p>Hi everybody,</p><p>I&#039;m looking for a way to change the mountpoint for my USB flashdisk at startup. OpenWRT always wants to mount the device at /tmp/mnt/disc0_1 (and actually does so).<br />I thought about adding a &#039;umount old mountpoint&#039; followed by &#039;mount new mountpoint&#039; to /etc/profiles, but that&#039;s a bit unsophisticated... Since there is no /etc/fstab or anything similar and I wasn&#039;t able to find any script to change, could someone please point me into the right direction?<br />Thanks in advance.</p><p>Regards,<br />dEvS</p><p>btw: I&#039;m running white russian rc4 on an asus wl500g deluxe (since today) and totally impressed by the great work!</p>									</div>

					<p>I dont see the /etc/hotplug.d dir in my distro at all - is this a &quot;new&quot; feature in RC3/4 or something? (I am still using some older intermediate nbd compile...)</p><p>I really could use the usb hotplug stuff, so I was wondering....:-)</p>									</div>
