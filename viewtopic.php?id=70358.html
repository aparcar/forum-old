					<p>Hi all</p><p>So, two days ago, following the wiki, I&#039;ve set up WDS between two Atheros routers of mine. (TP-Link TL-WR842ND as the AP, TP-Link TL-WR703n as the client.) Surprise, from practical point of view it worked like a charm at first try; the bridged hosts see both the internet and LAN, and vica versa.</p><p>Now, my problem is that the W-LAN client (TL-WR703n) does see the LAN, but doesn&#039;t see the internet. No package installation, no NTP, no ping outside, nothing.<br />I see that people are googling for &#039;openwrt wds no internet&#039; and similar, so it might not only me who has this issue. Unfortunately I couldn&#039;t find any solution so far.</p><p>Could anyone tell me what&#039;s wrong / how to solve this problem?<br />Or at least a hint if it is really a common problem?<br />Should I simply go for relayd?</p><p>Thank you in advance</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@703ap:~# cat /etc/config/network

					<p>Looks like the same common issue when setting up an Access Point.

					<p>For the W-LAN to access the internet, its IP config needs to look like a normal host config. Perhaps comparing the results of<br />ip addr show<br />and<br />ip route show<br />from the W-LAN client and from another (working) host on the network will show any differences.</p>									</div>

					<p>By experimenting, after adding a hateway I can ping external pages by IP. So some DNS related problem remains.<br />The WDS@Atheros wiki says<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>If this is a new OpenWrt setup, a DHCP server is enabled on the lan interface of the device by default. This needs to be disabled before the device is connected to the production network (assuming the production network already has DHCP set up). To do so, edit the /etc/config/dhcp file. Find the config dhcp &#039;lan&#039; section and add the line option ignore &#039;1&#039; to this section. This will disable the DHCP server on the lan interface. (The lan DHCP section will look like the wan DHCP section, as the DHCP server is already disabled on the wan interface by default.)[On Chaos Calmer 15.05 / LuCI (git-15.248.30277-3836b45), I had to disable the DHCP6 server as well, by changing option dhcpv6 &#039;server&#039; to option dhcpv6 &#039;disabled&#039;. MariusMatutiae]</p></blockquote></div><p>And this is what I exactly did. It is only suspicious since dns and dhcp is configured in the same file. The according wiki says amongst others<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>#Define your Domain and Domain Controllers IP address here.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option local &#039;/example.local/192.168.1.X&#039;**</p></blockquote></div><p>The essence is that <strong>hosts.conf</strong> and <strong>resolv.conf</strong> come into the play here somehow. But since I&#039;m illiterate (yet) I couldn&#039;t hack this information (yet?) together into a solution.</p><p>Any ideas if I&#039;m off track?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi hurjup</p><p>You got it. There&#039;s also need for one or more DNS servers under config interface &#039;lan&#039;.
