					<p>@dibdot,&nbsp; You are doing a phenomenal job.&nbsp; I am especially excited to see that in the next stage of development that you are adding the ability for the user to add their own sources through the UI.</p><p>Anyway, I have a question with regards to the whitelist feature.&nbsp; I have specifically been having issues with YouTube videos taking an extra 40-60 seconds before they will initialize and start playing.&nbsp; Using the Developer Tools within Chromium and looking in the Network section, I can see which domains are failing (getting blocked) and causing the delay in loading time.</p><p>Here is the contents of my adblock.whitelist file exactly as I have it:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>googlesyndication.com
googleadservices.com
google-analytics.com
doubleclick.net</code></pre></div><p>However, after rebooting the router and also the devices on the network a few times, I still have the initial slow loading of YouTube videos and the Developer Tools - Network section of Chromium still shows the same domains failing, causing long time out during the blockage.</p><p>So what I am wondering is, do I need to be more specific with sub-domains, etc.?</p><p>Hypothetical example:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ads2.googlesyndication.com
page2.googleadservices.com
adserver.google-analytics.com
ads2.doubleclick.net</code></pre></div><p>Thank you for your time.</p>									</div>

address=/www.google-analytics.com/192.0.2.1</code></pre></div><p>Now I put &quot;google-analytics.com&quot; in the whitelist, restart adblock and repeat the search:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/var/dnsmasq.d$ cat adb_list.* | grep &quot;google-analytics.com&quot;

I put it on my todo list to make this more powerful, but no promises ...</p><p>Anyway, could you please send me some example youtube links with the timeout issue (to my maintainer email, please).

					<p>@dibdot and @slh,&nbsp; Thank you both for your responses.</p><p>Dirk, especially thank you for explaining how the whitelists/blacklists are being processed in a way that was easy for me to understand.&nbsp; Your suggestion of being more specific with the subdomains as well has fixed my slow downs and YouTube videos are loading immediately now which is fantastic.&nbsp; I appreciate your time and your hard work.&nbsp; And I will definitely keep my fingers crossed for the future possibility of having more power with the whitelists/blacklists.</p><p>I will send a quick email shortly as well with a copy of the network traffic details from Chromium&#039;s developer tools. Essentially though, this was affecting any and all YouTube videos for me and all of the advertisement/tracker servers were being delayed and giving a &quot;failed&quot; response (each with a delay of approx. 4 seconds), I assume to be a time out of some sort.&nbsp; After following your suggestion to be specific with subdomains, all videos are loading immediately and instead of failed responses, the advertisement/tracker servers are providing error &quot;500&quot; status and only a typical delay of approx. 1-2ms.&nbsp; So all is well now.&nbsp; But I will send the network capture screenshot to your email shortly anyway for curiosity sake.&nbsp; Thank you again for your help.</p>									</div>
