					<p>I&#039;ve managed to get openswan working on openwrt. The process is somewhat involved, therefore I consider this a developer topic rather than something I would put a regular user through :-)</p><p>I documented what I did to get things working at <a href="http://wiki.linuxops.net/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=6">http://wiki.linuxops.net/tiki-read_arti … rticleId=6</a>, and for the brave I have packages ready to rock and roll at <a href="http://www.linuxops.net/ipkg">http://www.linuxops.net/ipkg</a>. Do read the article first though as openwrt needs to be modified somewhat to be able to run the openswan scripts. Well, until I package the coreutils &quot;tr&quot; and &quot;id&quot; tools for openwrt, that is.</p><p>The changes I made to openswan are temporary. From what I gather from the openwan developers they&#039;re working on making the openswan release ready for easy crosscompiling and ipkg packaging. Some changes are already in CVS, I heard. Of course all this is just building on the work others did. Most of the credit for the openswan end of things goes to Paul Wouters.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello PolarWolf,</p><p>i have 2 questions:</p><p>I am using a Linksys WRT54G-DE Hardware Revision 2.2 with the experimental squashfs build from May 24th.<br />Are the fixes you made implementet in this build (the binary openswan_2.3.1-1_mipsel.ipk) ?</p><p>Have you ever been made, or know someone who has made a successful VPN connection with this openswan version to a Checkpoint Firewall? </p><p>I am testing a few days now the example described on this page:<br /><a href="http://www.fw-1.de/aerasec/ng/vpn-freeswan/CP-FW1-NG+Linux-FreeSWAN-RoadWarrior.html">http://www.fw-1.de/aerasec/ng/vpn-frees … rrior.html</a> <br />but with no success. I know that i have to make changes in the config file because of the difference between free- and openswan.<br />For now i like to know if this is impossible, because it makes no sense spend more time on it if this can&#039;t be made.</p><p>Thank you very much</p>									</div>

At a quick glance it looks ok to me, but I haven&#039;t has a through look.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Have you ever been made, or know someone who has made a successful VPN connection with this openswan version to a Checkpoint Firewall?</p></blockquote></div><p>Nope, I lack a checkpoint setup for me to talk to. I&#039;m sure a quick search through the openswan mailing lists should turn something up though. If all else fails, ask there.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>I am testing a few days now the example described on this page:<br /><a href="http://www.fw-1.de/aerasec/ng/vpn-freeswan/CP-FW1-NG+Linux-FreeSWAN-RoadWarrior.html">http://www.fw-1.de/aerasec/ng/vpn-frees … rrior.html</a> <br />but with no success.

The fact that someone documented a freeswan-checkpoint interoperability tells me it&#039;s not impossible at all. Set things up as closely matched to what&#039;s documented and watch the logs. Try to debug from there as usually it&#039;s something very simple.</p><p>Oh, and make sure there aren&#039;t any firewalls in the way.</p>									</div>
