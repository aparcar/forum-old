					<p>I&#039;ve exhausted my troubleshooting abilities on an issue and looking for some advice moving forward.</p><p>First, I&#039;m thinking this is either an issue with my ISP (Comcast Business) or my new modem (ARRIS SB6190) or both.&nbsp; I&#039;ve happily run OpenWrt on a NetGear WNDR3700v2 for 3 or 4 years behind a Motorola SB6141 modem.&nbsp; I have raspbx running on a raspberry pi for about a year and this was all fine until a few months ago.&nbsp; I began getting latency spikes and packet loss confirmed by MTR.&nbsp; I ended up buying a new modem (the SB6190) and that problem seemed gone.&nbsp; Shortly after, I upgraded OpenWrt from 15.01? to the current version 15.05, choosing to keep the settings.&nbsp; All seems swell.</p><p>A few days after the upgrades, I can&#039;t make outgoing calls.&nbsp; Never had this trouble before and haven&#039;t changed any firewall settings.&nbsp; I restarted asterisk, checked firewall settings, SIP settings and even went back and forth with my VOIP provider (Vitelity).&nbsp; Though incoming traffic works fine and SIP registration works fine, Vitelity said they saw no traffic from me when I made outgoing calls.&nbsp; I logged onto my router and performed tcpdump and could clearly see the packets (UDP) being sent, but no return packets (huh???).&nbsp; I reset the WAN interface on OpenWrt and even restarted the router, but it did not help.</p><p>What did and still does work?&nbsp; Restarting the modem.&nbsp; When I restart the modem, I&#039;m able to initiate SIP calls (UDP connections to Vitelity&#039;s SIP server) for a few days (2-5), after which they begin to fail.&nbsp; I&#039;ve found no other network issues at all.&nbsp; I spend most of the day with persistent SSH and VPN (IPSEC and SSL) connections that work just fine, not to mention the gobs of web traffic and netflix streaming.</p><p>I guess I could buy a different modem and try that, but how could a modem malfunction in this very specific way?&nbsp; Any advice on how to figure this out would be appreciated.&nbsp; In the meantime, I&#039;m cycling my modem every few days.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry i am an asterisk noop but i think, <br />it is not possible that the modem are the reason even it is a pure DSL-ethernet-bridge.<br />I thing something goes wrong at the update.</p><p>How have you realyze the NAT-tunneling ? <br />If you tunneling the NAT via STUN i can not really help you.<br />But you can help me if you post the relevant code.<br />I try to use STUN in the next days.</p><p>If you use portforwarding be first sure that it works.<br />make a online portscan like here <a href="http://nmap.online-domain-tools.com/">http://nmap.online-domain-tools.com/</a><br />scan your SIP port 5060<br />be sure that you have portforwarding rules for RTP the rtp-range can be found in /etc/asterisk/rtp.conf</p><p>Then the next problem is that are the public IP must be inside the SIP header.<br />In the moment my Asterisk is direct connected to the WAN.<br />But asterisk start first and use a wrong (private) Address, the solution is to restart asterisk after the <br />WAN connection is etablisht.</p><p>from this reason try:<br /><strong>wait if you have internet connection and restart asterisk</strong><br />post the result here.</p><p>An other question is what say the asterisk console (asterisk -r)?</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your response.</p><p>I don&#039;t see how it could be a NAT thing since it affects outgoing packets, which never make it to the recipient.&nbsp; Also it&#039;s DOCSIS (Comcast Business), not DSL.&nbsp; Again, it works just fine for 2-5 days, then the behaviour resumes and packets disappear - they&#039;re visible on the router using tcpdump, but the recipient sees nothing.</p>									</div>

					<p>hmm OK i have overreading some parts, you are right.</p><p>Is the destination behind a NAT, and have you try to connect the SIP-port via portscan ?</p><p>My only last idea is that some UDP package are lost, <br />because DOCSIS shared medium overload etc ...<br />Have you try it to connect via TCP ?</p>									</div>
