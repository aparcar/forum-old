					<p>Hello,<br />I just bought mr3420 v3, unfortunately, there is not mention of v3 anywhere on this forum or on the internet. I normally compile my own firmware based on the imagebuilder but since v3 isn&#039;t in the profiles, it will not generate a v3 image.<br />I will be happy to contribute what I can since I have the device but I don&#039;t know what to do.<br />Can anyone help me compile an image for this version?<br />Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nahomt</strong> on 17 Nov 2016, 07:16)</p>

					<p>Hi, ARS made a good job, this LEDE version works fine. But space left is too small to extend root to usb. Could it be possible ARS build a version with block-mount, kmod-kmod-fs-ext4, kmod-usb-storage (may be kmod-usb-storage-extras)? Luci could be removed to gain space as it could be added in extroot fs. Thanks ! (can&#039;t find this topic in LEDE forum)</p>									</div>

					<p>Tested and works fine with extroot now on flash drive. The router didn&#039;t give ip on first rj45 connection but quickly resolved forcing my computer&#039;s ip on the same sub-network. Will continue to test it installing and checking packages. Great job! Thanks Ahmad.</p>									</div>
