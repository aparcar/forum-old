					<p>Ok, I need a bit of advice. I have the same exact problem. I have TP Link WR741ND (ar7xx), OpenWRT Attitude Adjustment rc1, and a third-party (not configurable) device on serial port.</p><p>I need to totally disable all writes to serial port and totally release the port of openwrt.</p><p>I have cross-compiled a binary program, that takes care for the serial communication.</p><p>The thing is, that I have tested my program on router Linksys WRT54GL and everything works fine. But Linksys router has two serial ports. I used port 1 because openwrt doesn’t use it at all.</p><p>But on my new router, WR741ND, I have only one serial port, that is somehow taken by openwrt and something doesn’t work.</p><p>(i’m took care of port names… Linksys /dev/tts/1 and n TP-Link /dev/ttyATH0)… that’s not the problem).</p><p>I even tried with oscilloscope and it seems that my binary program on TP-link doesn’t give any output (same program on Linksys works fine (i just change the declaration of serial ports from /dev/tts/1 to /dev/ttyATH0).</p><p>So, my question… I need to compile openwrt and disable serial kernel writes? Can you help me, what i have to change? Maybe forward kernel writes to /dev/null?</p>									</div>

However, I ran into similar issue where I tried to use a LaFonera serial port as a serial console port. When connected to a serial-console port on other devices, I could see incoming traffics, but no key-pressed activities output from my LaFonera. In other words, no output from my LaFonera serial port.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi!</p><p>Yes, I deleted the line in /etc/inittab, rebooted the router and nothing changes.<br />The thing is that during boot time, OpenWRT is writing something to serial port.<br />I want to completely disable that, even if I need to recompile the openwrt again.</p><p>1. Can someone tell me, what to change or how to compile openwrt to disable system outputs to serial?</p><p>2. Is there maybe any workaround to redirect openwrt serial writes to other device, for example /dev/null, and then serial port would be free for me?</p><p>The thing is, that my router TP-Link WR741ND has only one serial and it&#039;s taken by the system. </p><p>Please help, guys.</p>									</div>

As I said before, it works just fine with my LaFonera FON2100 device which I can now use it as a serial console interface to troubleshoot many different Linux embedded systems.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>The thing is that during boot time, OpenWRT is writing something to serial port.</p></blockquote></div><p>I can&#039;t confirm this because I don&#039;t have any oscilloscope to peek into the serial port. However, I am 100% convinced what you said is true (see my explanation below).</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>I want to completely disable that, even if I need to recompile the openwrt again.</p></blockquote></div><p>I don&#039;t know much about this. However, what I can say is as soon as a Linux embedded system I connected through a serial console boots up, its boot manager will print out its status on to its serial console port, let alone the kernel messages once the device is booting. If you want a total silence on a serial console, perhaps you may have to build your own and replace the boot manager and/or firmware with any early printk and/or debug messages disabled. I hope someone who has more experience than me can prove me wrong and will be able to help you on how to turn off a serial console.</p>									</div>
