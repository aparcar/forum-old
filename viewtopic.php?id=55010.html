					<p>Hi,</p><p>it seems like the UCI-Configuration for minidlna ignores some&nbsp; options, at least the force_sort_criteria option. Adding it to /etc/config/minidlna doesn&#039;t affect the automatically made /var/minidlna.conf. Manually creating a config file (e.g. /etc/minidlna.conf) with the force_sort_criteria option and starting minidlna using this one works though. That of course takes away the possibility to use the web interface (luci) to configure minidlna, which is quite comfortable. Also this way it is necessary to edit the init.d file to start minidlna with the new config file at the next startup. It would be great if someone could fix that for CC or tell me what I&#039; m doing wrong ;-)</p><p>Greetz,<br />Elchi</p>									</div>
