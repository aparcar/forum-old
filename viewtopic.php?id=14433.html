					<p>Yes it is also my impression that the Alix and Soekris are relatively similar, same cpu types etc. Except the Soekris net5501 has no VGA but four Via nic&#039;s instead. </p><p>Should probably have been more specific with my question from the beginning. I have a Soekris net5501 with a 500 Mhz AMD cpu and 512 MB RAM, and I wanted to build a new image for x86, from trunk, and wanted to know if anybody had encountered oddities with this board (of the kind which could be solved with changes in &quot;make menuconfig&quot; configuration)?<br />My basic assumption is that the installation itself is as simple as dd&#039;ing the image (with its three components) onto a CF-Card and then boot the board from that.</p><p>Chz</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, <br />I have just tried to run kamikaze on a soerkris net5501. <br />I can get serial cosole, but no eth working. <br />I think the via eth driver is missing... Is there a way to rebuild kamikaze with the missing drivers ? </p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi KiaZ,</p><p>I&#039;m fairly new to this myself, so I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a better way to do this (but here I go anyways).</p><p>Run &quot;make menuconfig&quot;, go into &quot;Kernel modules&quot;--&gt;&quot;Network Devices&quot;, and select &quot;kmod-via-rhine&quot; twice (so it shows an asterisk).\<br />Exit out, save the config and re-run &quot;make world&quot;.</p><p>It worked when I just tested it now in my setup, so hopefully it&#039;ll work for you as wel.</p><p>-Robert</p>									</div>
