					<p>Hi Overseer,<br />(sorry for my bad english)</p><p>Don&#039;t know what a transparent bridge is, but... In my guide, I&#039;ve made a second network (the guest) on the first router and made the second router &quot;see&quot; this second network. This is what you&#039;re doing?</p><p>If this router (your tp-link wr741nd v4.2) is not the one connected (the gateway), and it only knows your lan and nothing else... the only way (that I know) to make you guest network reach internet, is forwarding the guest traffic to the lan, but that means that anyone on the guest network would see the computers on the private network. If that&#039;s not a problem, you can go to Network, Firewall, and allow forwarding from the guest zone to the lan zone.</p><p>This router is your gateway to the internet? No? Is your gateway (the router connected to the internet) running openwrt?</p>									</div>

					<p>He probably means that this router is smack in the middle of a other private network.<br />You could set it up with vlan trunking if that is possible, or limmit the access from the guest network to only to the lan gateway with some iptable magic.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the quick replies.</p><p>@digital: very good guide man! indeed my tplink is connected only to my lan, it is not the gateway. The gateway is a laFonera 2.0, which as far as i know is running on a modded openwrt version</p><p>@FriedZombie that&#039;s what i&#039;m trying to do, but i don&#039;t know how <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /> </p><br /><p>&nbsp; I have seen it on some router firmwares (like on fonera router, openmesh, etc) where you just plug the router to your lan, and it becomes a &quot;dumb&quot; ap, but at the same time there is a second signal that gives only internet access to guest, while blocking them from seeing the local network.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well.. I think I can&#039;t help you then, sorry.<br />My netgear (both, actually) did something like that (guest wifi, not reaching private lan).<br />Maybe (trying <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" />)... What if you forward traffic from guest to private lan (this gives internet access... I think) AND made iptables block any access attempt to your private lan IP range?<br />I envy who knows how to use iptables <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p>									</div>

					<p>a hotspot is a guest wifi, when a user is past the captive page, they do have access to the network laying behind it. Or you should half some firewall rules in place to limmit that access.</p><p>But rather set it up with vlans, the wiki has a pretty good examples and explanations on that</p>									</div>
