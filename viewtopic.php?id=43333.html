					<p>Hello all, im new at the forum but kind of old using openwrt for routers and other aplications.</p><p>I have a bash scripton my computer running on centos 5.9, This script is made to make a custom configuration in some equipments that i use via ssh, but the equipments by default have a password, i cant use ssh keys because i only need to config the outof the box equipment to our needs and plug it off so i used a tool called ssh-pass (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sshpass/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/sshpass/</a>).</p><p>with this tool i can make commands like:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>sshpass -p &#039;password&#039; ssh admin@192.168.1.1 &#039;reboot&#039;</p></blockquote></div><p>and run a lot of commands sending the password, if i dont have this tool i need to put the password every time a command its set.</p><p>Im not really sure how to do this, i need it running on openwrt, and i dont know where to start. Can you give me a hint? </p><p>Best regards.</p><p>Ps. on Centos i installed it via yum in case you wonder how i did it on the computer.</p><p>JB.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>CyB3RMX</strong> on 9 Apr 2013, 18:29)</p>
