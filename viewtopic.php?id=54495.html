					<p>@maplewang: JSON-RPC via POST requests, the REST approach is too cumbersome in my opinion.<br />@Wandy: eventually<br />@roger_: I&#039;m not sure if help from the community is whats needed at this stage, first of all the framework needs to be finalized and the architecture finished. Having a dozen apps at this stage while the APIs aren&#039;t stable yet would not really help.</p>									</div>

					<p>Interesting too see, i have been coming back and looking at what is happening with Luci2 for a while now. From what I have seen it looks to be more mobile friendly is that correct?</p><p>Also i noticed boostrap theme is a little more mobile friendly now (not 100% sure on this though , it just looks and feels that way). Also noticed a change 7 months ago on the cascade.css file:</p><p><a href="http://luci.subsignal.org/trac/changeset/10378">http://luci.subsignal.org/trac/changeset/10378</a></p><p>Jow, you may remember the chat we had regarding Luci and the theme i was developing. Well I have run out of time to develop it any further this stage so I am looking forward to any developments you make in Luci 2.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=716QNKbaR00">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=716QNKbaR00</a></p><p>We are always looking to adopt a mobile friendly theme for &quot;Rooter&quot;:</p><p><a href="http://ofmodemsandmen.com/">http://ofmodemsandmen.com/</a></p>									</div>
