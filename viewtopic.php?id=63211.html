					<p>I&#039;ve installed Chaos Calmer (15.05, r46767) onto my router, and my IPv6 connectivity is behaving strangely:</p><p>When I&#039;m logged into the router, IPv6 works fine: I can ping6 dev.openwrt.org and get responses. However, when I&#039;m on my laptop, the same thing produces nothing.</p><p>My openwrt box has a /128 address from my ISP on its WAN interface, and ::1 of a /64 prefix-delegation on its LAN interface. The routing table has default from the /128 and the /64 via the same router.</p><p>My laptop has SLAAC addresses from the /64, and a default route via openwrt.</p><p>I ran tcpdump on the wan interface of openwrt, and saw the outbound echo requests from my laptop, but no replies.</p><p>I haven&#039;t seen this issue mentioned here or on google.</p><p>Does anyone have a suggestion for what to try next to isolate the issue?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gmacon</strong> on 10 Mar 2016, 02:53)</p>

					<p>I say &quot;Solved&quot;, but it really just went away.</p><p>I had disabled the wan6 interface so that I could do things without sitting through the timeouts. I turned it back on to play around with it some more, and now it works, though I haven&#039;t actually changed anything. I&#039;m blaming this on my ISP.</p>									</div>
