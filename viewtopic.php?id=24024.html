					<p>Hello, I have a router WL-520GU with openwrt but I would like to setup a ssh tunnel (within the router) so wireless clients connected (laptop) to the router transparently use that tunnel for only ports 80 and 443.</p><p>I know I can use Putty on the laptop and establish a tunnel to the ssh server (which works now), but I would like to do transparently, meaning I don&#039;t have install putty on the clients (laptops) or change internet explorer setting but in stead I would like to have a setup/configuration in which the router&nbsp; forwards/redirects TPC request for port 80,443 to the SSH tunnel so my wireless clients don&#039;t have to change anything on their side. The big constrain is I have to use SSH for the tunnel on the server side. </p><p>Is this possible?</p><p>Laptop Wireless (http/https call) -&gt; openwrt -&gt; SSH tunnel -&gt; SSHServer</p>									</div>

					<p>There may be a way to hack this together, but if there&#039;s any way you can go to a VPN solution such as OpenVPN it&#039;ll probably save you significant time setting it up and gain you performance, along with being more flexible; I gather there are performance problems with tunnelling TCP connections through TCP which can accumulate over time and are difficult to diagnose, much less resolve.</p>									</div>
