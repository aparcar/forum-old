					<p>Hello,</p><p>Im new to OpenWRT, and I am starting to like this a lot. I am having trouble setting up the QoS. I am trying to set up the ctshaper qos mechanism and have copied the necessary scipts and all. Now, for marking the packets in IPTABLES (i am new to linux networking), I was not able to add the necessary rules to &quot;firewall.user&quot; in /etc as the FAQ had asked me to do. The problem is that, the file firewall.user is read-only. Also, i checked the files /rom/etc/firewall.user and /etc/init.d/S45firewall and both these files are read-only as well. How can i apply these settings.</p><p>Btw, I am trying to setup a high priority for VoIP calls.</p><p>sabeel</p>									</div>
