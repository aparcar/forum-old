					<p>Hi all -</p><p>I have latest and greatest installed - OpenWrt Barrier Breaker 14.07 / LuCI Trunk (0.12+svn-r10530) on my Archer C7 v2.</p><p>I&#039;d like to get 802.11ac speeds from this thing, and from what I&#039;ve read, I think that&#039;s possible with OpenWRT, but I can&#039;t figure out how to configure it properly. I&#039;ve combed the documentation, but honestly, I&#039;m not really sure what I&#039;m looking for...</p><p>So my questions are:<br />1) Can I in fact do 802.11ac speeds with OpenWRT on the Archer C7 v2?<br />2) What settings do I need? </p><p>I&#039;m happy to edit /etc/config/wireless, or change the settings through the gui. I just have this feeling I&#039;ve missed something basic.&nbsp; Thanks in advance for your help.</p><p> Here&#039;s my /etc/config/wireless:</p><p>config wifi-device &#039;radio0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option type &#039;mac80211&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option path &#039;pci0000:01/0000:01:00.0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option txpower &#039;17&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option country &#039;US&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option channel &#039;40&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option htmode &#039;HT40&#039;</p><p>config wifi-iface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;radio0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option network &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option mode &#039;ap&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option key &#039;password&#039;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option encryption &#039;psk2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ssid &#039;acfaster&#039;</p><p>config wifi-device &#039;radio1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option type &#039;mac80211&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option channel &#039;11&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option hwmode &#039;11g&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option path &#039;platform/qca955x_wmac&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option htmode &#039;HT20&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option txpower &#039;30&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option country &#039;US&#039;</p><p>config wifi-iface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;radio1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option network &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option mode &#039;ap&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option encryption &#039;psk2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option key &#039;password&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ssid &#039;acfaster&#039;</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry, I thought you couldn&#039;t get your wireless to work at all and am surprised that would work with your config.</p><p>There are a couple of other threads about the Barrier Breaker speed regressions. Unless you have a WAN with more than 300Mbs access then I wouldn&#039;t think the Lan or WiFi throttling would hurt. If you need the faster speeds then you might need to wait for OpenWrt improvements.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, but I don&#039;t believe this is a throughput problem. I think it&#039;s a config problem. I&#039;ve not measured actual throughput, I&#039;ve only been going by the connection speed my laptop reports. I would expect it to report something above 300mbps if 802.11ac were working, as it does with the stock firmware.</p><p>I&#039;ve only used the GUI to config, and I&#039;ve not tried to do anything &quot;crazy&quot;. What am I missing?</p>									</div>

					<p>Check the wiki again - 802.11ac instructions have been added recently. I don&#039;t think luci in 14.07 will report 802.11ac speeds or that the config is setup correctly.</p>									</div>

					<p>drawz thanks for the idea.&nbsp; Went back to the wiki, and found this:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Note: Luci for Barrier Breaker does not supporting configuring 802.11ac via the web GUI (supported in Chaos Calmer trunk branch as of 10/2014). To enable 802.11ac, run the following commands from the command line (telnet/ssh):</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>uci set wireless.radio0.htmode=VHT80
