					<p>Hi, I would like to install prosody on my linksys 160NL router(ar71xx), but i cant get it to work.<br />On creating accounts it tells me that it is unable to store them and that this perhaps is caused by absent permissions.<br />I am however under the impression that i gave it the required permissions, but my knowledge of linux is allmost 0, so i could be wrong.</p><p>This is what i did:<br />1. I made sure i have all dependencies, which in my case meant that i had to install luasocked which i did through luci.<br />2. I installed prosody through luci.<br />3. I opened up a SSH session through putti and browsed to /etc/prosody where i opened in vi prosody.cfg.lua<br />4. I changed allow_registration = false; to true and verified that the module &quot;register&quot; is enabled,&nbsp; so that people can register their accounts with their clients.<br />5. For a brief moment i pondered how crazy one must be to imagine a navigation as is in vi.<br />(for noobs like me. You edit by pressing &quot;i&quot; and when done, end edit mode with esc. When completely done you safe the file with ZZ )<br />6.&nbsp; I verified that there was a virtualhost, which was the case, namely &quot;localhost&quot;. <br />7. In the lua file is a path that is prolly relevant to my problem, namely pidfile = &quot;/var/run/prosody/prosody.pid&quot;<br />at this point, i leave it unchanged.<br />8. I safe the lua file.<br />9. in luci/startup i enable prosody and reboot the router.<br />10. In my jabberclient i try to connect without succes to the local ip(192.168.1.1), and to my external ip. In both cases with &quot;create new account&quot; enabled. [unable to connect]<br />11. I open up another SSH session and browse back to /etc/prosody<br />12. I try to manually create an account with prosodyctl adduser me@localhost, fill in password twice and get the message: <strong>&quot;unable to store, perhaps you don&#039;t have the permission?&quot;</strong></p><p>13.&nbsp; I assume that what i might be looking for, is the pidfile i mentioned at step 7. so thats where im going.<br />in /var/run there is no prosody dir, so i am making that. and in it, i create a file prosody.pid with vi, i add 2 what i hope to be comment lines -- and safe the file.<br />14. I try jabberclient again, with create account enabled, over local and public ip, without result<br />15. I try prosodyctl again, again no result.<br />16. I set the ownership of var/run/prosody to prosody by typing chown prosody prosody, no result<br />17. In earlier attempts i changed the pid dir to other locations in the lua file and used chown on all relevant dirs i could find, but&nbsp; also without result<br />18. I ask at forum <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /> Im out of idears. Why wont step 12 work.</p><p>19. I noticed that prosodyctl start gives the error theat prosody can not be started because prosody.cfg.lua can not be found in /etc/prosody. LIES! I created a new folder and copied the original file there, and created an empty file in the /etc/prosody dir, and started prosodyctl start&nbsp; again which this time told me it was missing a pid path.<br />Very curious, the original file has the correct name &quot;prosody.cfg.lua&quot; and not &quot;prosody.cfg.lua.dist&quot; it should have found it. I tried to copy it back and rename it and rename it back, but it wont see it. So i will manually make the file in the hope it will then see it.</p><p>20. So it seems that this was indeed the cause of the problems so far.<br /> i created a new prosody.cfg.lua file by hand and it goes further.<br />21. removed localhost virtualhost because it was complainng about not finding a active virtualhost. Maybe with only one virtualhost it will be active per default, because i can find no activate command<br />22. removed ssl because i dont know how to make a key and it was complaining about not having one.<br />23. uninstall/reboot/install/uninstall/reboot/install etc, on every attempt on testing prosodyctl start, because a second time it will lock ports and wont work until i uninstall and reboot.<br />23. ...yea.. no logic at all.. with all correct stuff in the lua it didnt work, and when i placed all examplestuff in it does, and after i remove the examplestuff it does as well..<br />i hate linux.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>trendpoinder2</strong> on 3 Sep 2012, 11:45)</p>

					<p>never mind.. it still doesnt work right.<br />i understand now that the path that should get permission is<br />/etc/prosody/data/domainname/accounts<br />so i do <br />chown prosody prosody<br />chown prosody data<br />chown prosody domainname<br />chown prosody accounts</p><p>but it still wont work<br />it works now if i personally add a file there (which i will prolly be going to be content about because im about to throw my pc through my window)</p><p>chmod a+rw domainname <br />chmod a+rw accounts<br />also nogo.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>trendpoinder2</strong> on 3 Sep 2012, 12:10)</p>

					<p>yea.. ofc there was another headache.. to my surprise i did not even have to compile a new version of linux to continue.. i am still prolly not there yet though.<br />What was the case that the certificate (that i swear i could see him get from google), ended in 2010, resulting in being able to connect, but needing to accept certificate each logon, and the inability to invite users.<br />this last part i dont test alone so must wait to see if what i did indeed fixed it.<br />24. i installed openssl-tools<br />25. went to etc/prosody/certs and removed the localhost certs that where there<br />26. then i created a key with openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out &quot;localhosty.cert&quot; -keyout &quot;localhost.key&quot;<br />27. now i have to wait for my friend to find out if this worked.;)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>trendpoinder2</strong> on 3 Sep 2012, 14:15)</p>
