					<p>I have a TP-Link wr1043nd with openwrt 15.05.1 installed on it. I want to use the router to share my android phones mobile data connection through usb. I am following this tutorial on the wiki (I am not allowed to post links): USB Tethering to an OpenWrt router<br />But since I don&#039;t have internet access I can&#039;t download the kmod-usb-net and other packages. I can sign into the router with Putty and Winscp. So I want to download the packages manually then put them on the router with winscp and install them with putty. I am lost at which package I have to download. From the System -&gt; Software -&gt; Configuration page I got this url for the repository: downloads(dot)openwrt(dot)org/chaos_calmer/15.05.1/ar71xx/generic/packages/base<br />If I want to download the kmod-usb-net package which one should I choose? There are 20 differnet versions.<br />Any help is appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>You probably need three of the kmod-usb-net packages: kmod-usb-net kmod-usb-net-rndis kmod-usb-net-cdc-ether </p><p>You also need a few other, refer to: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/usb.tethering">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/usb.tethering</a></p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s not complicated to connect to the Internet temporarily.&nbsp; Turn on the wifi hotspot in your phone and set up a wifi STA for it in the router, then attach it to the WAN network instead of the Ethernet port.&nbsp; This is a routed client.</p><p>Installing kmod-usb-net-rndis should bring in the others as dependencies.</p>									</div>
