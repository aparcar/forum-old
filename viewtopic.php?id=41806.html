					<p>gday all.<br />i am a new user to openwrt i have a basic knowledge of Linux but this is my first experience with an embedded Linux system. if anyone could give me some tips or put me on the right track i would appreciate it.</p><p>my main network consists of a stock Net-gear D6300 witch i have several wired and wireless computers connected to. i have a nas server that only has a&nbsp; wired connection. the wifi network is secured and i would like to keep it that way if i can.</p><p>i would like to use my TP-Link TL-WA901ND [running openWrt] as a wifi bridge to connect&nbsp; the nas server wirelessly to my home network and be able to access the nas server from any of the other computers that are on the main network.</p><p>on the tp-link i have luci installed and the wifi connected to the netgear router. i am unable to work out how to join the lan and wifi adapters together as some kind of bridge so that when i connect the nas server to the lan it will be apart of the main network.</p><p>if some one could point me to in the right direction i would be very great full.</p><p>p.s sorry if this has already being answered i have spent a good 4 hours looking threw the forms and i have being unable to find someone trying to do what i am a few things close but not quite the same.</p>									</div>

					<p>Welcome,<br />sure it is a bit of a nightmare trying to search the forum. Sometimes key words are not obvious.<br />In your post I assume you meant &quot;a part&quot; not &quot;apart&quot;.<br />Does this help:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39077">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39077</a></p>									</div>
