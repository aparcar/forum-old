					<p>I flashed successfully factory and sysupgrade images. Device and web gui is functional. Devices, which are connected to integrated LAN switch, can access Internet.</p><p>I configured wireless access point (incl. seting country code and enabling radio). <strong>I can connect from wireless devices to the access point but the Internet Service Provider system prompts me to register new MAC address.</strong> The number of MAC addresses are limited and I have many devices so there is no way to register them all + when I have some visitor then I would like him to have immediate access.</p><p>So it seems that devices connected to LAN ports are represented by WAN MAC while the devices connected through wireless are not. I suppose that in the original device firmware the wireless devices were represented by WAN MAC.</p><p>I am quite struggling here. I did not give it up but any hint would be appreciated.</p><p>==<br />I went outside to get some fresh air and it probbaly cleaned my head. I found out the cause of my problem. The wireless network interface had enabled access to LAN and <strong>WAN</strong>. Although I did not mess with the configuration, I am not sure if it was by default or by my mistake. Wireless devices obtained IP address from ISP DHCP server rather than my router DHCP server. When I disabled access to WAN then the wireless devices obtained IP address from router DHCP server and they were able to access Internet.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ace960</strong> on 8 Feb 2018, 15:45)</p>
