					<p>I have a pretty standard configuration setup with wlan0 + lan - a lan zone and a separate wan zone, which is actually connected to the rest of my (internal) wired network. I am trying to set up a simple set of firewall rules - both via the (LuCi gui) and uci, but I am getting really frustrated with it.</p><p>Here is what I am trying to do (assuming 10.1.1.2 is the wan IP address of my OpenWrt, 10.1.2.2 is the lan zone IP address):</p><p>config &#039;rule&#039;<br />option &#039;src&#039; &#039;wan&#039;<br />option &#039;src_ip&#039;&#039;10.1.1.2&#039;<br />option &#039;dest_ip&#039; &#039;10.1.1.127&#039;<br />option &#039;dest_port&#039; &#039;53&#039;<br />option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;udp&#039;<br />option &#039;family&#039;&#039;ipv4&#039;<br />option &#039;target&#039;&#039;ACCEPT&#039;</p><p>This, basically, enables my OpenWrt to make dns queries. The 10.1.1.127 machine hosts my network-wide dns server on the &quot;wan&quot; (from OpenWrt&#039;s point of view). The above rule, surprisingly (and annoyingly) translates in the following iptables chain:</p><p>Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)<br />pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination<br />0 0 ACCEPT all -- * * 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED<br />[...]<br />0 0 input_rule all -- * * 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0<br />0 0 input all -- * * 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0<br />[...]</p><p>Chain input (1 references)<br />pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination<br />0 0 zone_lan all -- br-lan * 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0<br />0 0 zone_wan all -- eth1 * 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0<br />[...]</p><p>Chain zone_wan (1 references)<br />pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination<br />0 0 ACCEPT udp -- * * 10.1.1.2 10.1.1.127 udp dpt:53</p><p>The way this is set up, my rule above will <strong>never</strong> get any matches! Why is my rule gone into the INPUT chain where it should have been placed in the OUTPUT (or similar) chain as the source zone (and ip address) is clearly the machine on which OpenWrt runs? Am I missing something obvious here?</p><p>Another mystery - I see that all of my input/output_rule chains are in the right places, but they are empty - how do I add rules to be included in these chains, is there any way I could do that (short of attaching raw iptables statement in firewall.users)?</p><p>Also, a couple of queries about my wireless - according to the hardware wiki I have atheros wireless hardware. Does that mean the &quot;Madwifi Options&quot; listed in the wireless configuration section shown <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless#madwifi.options1">here</a> apply to me (i.e. I could use them)? Is there a more detailed description of these?</p><p>With regards to the WPA mode used - I intend to configure WPA-Enterprise (external RADIUS who does the authentication) - I take it unless I install a fully-blown hostapd (not the -mini version) I can&#039;t use the auth_*, acct_* and the nasid options, just the &quot;server&quot;, &quot;port&quot;, &quot;key&quot; and &quot;wpa_group_rekey&quot; are available to me, right?</p><p>If I <strong>do</strong> install the full hostapd, then I assume the above set of options are irrelevent/not used and only the auth_*, acct_* and nasid apply to me, right?</p><p>I also assume that all authentication requests made by a (wireless) client captured by my AP will be properly redirected to the external RADIUS server, provided the above options are set - is that correct?</p><p>Last query - In one of the LuCi configuration panels there are quite a few options I can configure with regards to my LEDs - is there a description of these somewhere (another wiki page perhaps)? I would like to reconfigure the LEDs to react to different events (like wifi connection/association, authorisation failure/success, enable/disable wifi etc), but I can&#039;t make heads or tails of the configuration page shown in LuCi - there a lot of things there I cannot understand.</p><p>Thanks in advance for any advice given!</p>									</div>

I am asking this because I use other firewall packages and never had this before.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>jow wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>A section with src and no dest results in input, a section with src and dest results in forward rules. Not sure why you want to whitelist outgoing dns though, wan output is always allowed.</p></blockquote></div><p>That&#039;s very odd setup. Going by what you are saying above, there is no way I could define rules for outward traffic then (i.e. firewall(wan)-&gt;internet), or is it (short of inserting raw iptables statements in firewall.users)?<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>jow wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>The *_rule chains are user chains, they&#039;re meant to be used with custom iptables commands.</p></blockquote></div><p>I see. If that is the case then I might scrap this kind of setup for the filrewall and use my own. Is Shorewall(-lite) supported (or could it be supported)? I am aware that I might be a bit limited as far as available disk space is concerned, but if this becomes an issue I might compile a static shorewall firewall setup, copy it over and dump the whole lot of raw iptables statements into firewall.users. Before I do that though, I wanted to make sure that I am not doing something wrong/in error as this is a route I don&#039;t really want to take - the LuCi gui seemed very straight-forward, but I see that the existing firewall setup might be a bit limited for me.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>jow wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Madwifi options do not apply to your device, only mac80211.</p></blockquote></div><p>So, in other words my wireless is not atheros then? According to the hardware wiki <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start#tp-link">here</a> my wireless is Atheros AR92xx, which I take it to mean that the options for madwifi should work - &quot;The options in the table below only work with type atheros.&quot; that is what it says on the wiki, or am I reading it wrong?<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>jow wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Yes, hostapd full will enable the missing options.</p></blockquote></div><p>In other words, all auth_*, acct_* and the nasid options should be OK, thus the &quot;server&quot;, &quot;port&quot;, &quot;key&quot; and &quot;wpa_group_rekey&quot; are irrelevant, right?</p><p>Also, assuming I go via this route and deploy the full hostapd, the AP (via hostapd) <strong>will</strong> handle and redirect the proper authentication requests to the RADIUS server, is that correct - I don&#039;t need to do anything else in addition to setting the above options (and configuring the RADIUS, obviously)?<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>jow wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>As for the led config, look around in /sys/class/led/ and read the kernel code, there are many possible triggers (some optionally installable) with varying options. The gui only covers a subset of them.</p></blockquote></div><p>Which kernel - the OpenWrt one I presume? Is there any particular part of the kernel code/docs I should be looking at? </p><p>I actually plan to build the whole thing from source myself next week, because I&#039;d like to customise it (the first thing I&#039;d do is get rid of BusyBox though - I hate this stuff!) and deploy it to the router if this setup is a successful one. Thanks for your comments jow, much appreciated!</p>									</div>
