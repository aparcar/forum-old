					<p>Since many people have waited for so long and are now fed up with Belkin , I am opening a new topic for all return/refund related information .</p><p>Some have already reported success .<br />I am going to try and have this thing refunded too , but have not contacted my reseller yet .</p><p>Any question , any information to post around the subject ? Shoot .</p><br /><p>Edit : I just issued for a refund&nbsp; (by the webshop I purchased it from) . Saying it was advertised as an open source router that can run openwrt but it doesnt .</p><p>Edit2 : refund accepted . One funny thing is : on the rma document they set for reason &quot;crashes whole the time and needs a poweroff daily&quot; . I did not mention any of this , the reason I gave them was &quot;it does not run openwrt and there is no source of the wifi drivers available .&quot; They must have had more returns for this product for sure <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I ordered an Asus RT-AC68U to replace it .</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>CrimInalA</strong> on 12 Aug 2014, 16:51)</p>

					<p>It seems all retailers are accepting refunds on the router pretty easily without asking questions . Makes me think most of them already have had tons of returns on this product .</p>									</div>

					<p>The TP-Link Archer C7 runs OpenWrt just fine and supports 802.11ac. The Netgear R7000 works under DD-WRT and I think there was some work toward support in Tomato. I&#039;d get the Archer C7 personally.</p>									</div>

					<p>@justniz : Try to get a refund from Best Buy . It should not be hard as I&#039;ve seen many posts of people returning it without the reseller giving them a hard time . Me included . I was shocked on how easy they took it back and refunded my money . It looked like many more people before me had requested refunds and resellers know about the issues the routers have by now . I had used my router for over 4 months , so also way past the normal return limit . Got a 100% refund .</p><p>Returning the units would hurt Belkin more than starting a class action imo <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Now for the router to get instead , I can highly recommend the Asus RT-AC68U which I got . It runs DD-wrt if you want . altough DD-wrt is not my favourite anymore since their beta and stable releases are untrackable and all over the place . That is my opinion .<br />There are also Tomato builds for it (<a href="http://tomato.groov.pl/tomatoanon.php?model=Asus+RT-AC68R%2FU">http://tomato.groov.pl/tomatoanon.php?m … -AC68R%2FU</a>) , but I&#039;m waiting for a build with less known issues before I&#039;m flashing my beloved tomato on it (actually I will wait till advanced tomato runs on the unit , I like that the most) .<br />For now , I&#039;m running Merlin WRT on it . It has got all the options I need at the moment , supporting scripting , openvpn , logfiles , monitoring , wifi tweaks and so on . <br />And the best part is , I got the unit for more than 100€ less compared to the WRT1900 <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>You said this really well btw :<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>justniz wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I&#039;m guessing the clueless marketing types at Belkin were already thinking that the stock firmware need only be a placeholder since anyone buying this unit would almost certainly be planning to replace the stock firmware with an opensource one that would magically appear from nowhere.

I bought mine over a month ago at Best Buy. Running the latest firmware and updated it right out of the box. Zero issues. No random reboots or any thing like that. Stability over features imo. Not others share the same. But, this router has been a set and for get deal. I came from a Linksys E4200 v1 that was a little over 3 years old. During the time. I ran stock firmware for the first year and then Tomato firmware for the remaining. Never a problem with either and the unit still works fine today. I only replaced it do to age. WRT1900AC is a solid and stable router that is very simple to use. That is what the majority of consumers like. I don&#039;t like how Linksys is handling the 3rd party firmware. That is another story.</p>									</div>
