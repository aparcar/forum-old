					<p>Hi Alex,</p><p>Im having the exact same issue setting up an AP. I followed the guide with LUCI and tried to setup a guest network.&nbsp; I get ip&#039;s from the guest network&#039;s DHCP but <strong>no</strong> internet. can anyone help with why the advised DNS and DHCP traffic rules created dont give internet to devices? <br />Ive seen many discussions on here with users having the same issue on different devices.</p><p>Please can someone help with this issue?</p>									</div>
