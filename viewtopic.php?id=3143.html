					<p>Hi, I&#039;new of openwrt and I&#039;working for an italian comapny looking for a low cost all-in wireless router to use as an all-in-one wirless client for outdoor networks. I usually work with linux and I&#039;m interested on opensource in genral and so I proposed my boss to try with openwrt. <br />Linksys version &lt; 4 are pratically unaviable in italy, so we looked for something else. We found a Siemens SE505 that seemed to be supported looking at the compatibilty list and to older posts such as :&nbsp; <a href="http://openwrt.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=2998">http://openwrt.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=2998</a>. </p><p>Yesterday I tried to flash some openwrt versions, I hadn&#039;t problem with tftp but when the router reboots seems unreachable. <br />You can ping it on the factory default address for 10 seconds when booting (192.168.2.1) but then nothing. <br />However LAN led blinks if pinged, and also other leds (other LAN and WAN) light if plugged. </p><p>Searching this forum and the internet I found some pics of the supposed &quot;v2&quot; of SE505 and I noticed that they are a bit different from mine. Here&#039;s a picutre of my SE505, sorry for the low res, I could post a hi-res pic tomorrow if useful. <br /><a href="http://img384.imageshack.us/my.php?image=mobosiemnsse5053kx.jpg"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://img384.imageshack.us/img384/4303/mobosiemnsse5053kx.th.jpg" alt="http://img384.imageshack.us/img384/4303/mobosiemnsse5053kx.th.jpg" /></span></a></p><p>Is there any hopeness to see openwrt working on my SE505 ? </p><p>I can help testing experimental versions if needed .</p><p>However, if there&#039;s no way with this SE505, I absolutly need to find another router aviable in italy and &lt; 80 ? expensive working.</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>									</div>
