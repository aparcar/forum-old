					<p>I&#039;ve got a gateworks board running openwrt and I&#039;m looking at adding a 802.11n minipci card. Does anyone have a recommendation as to a particular one? I&#039;ve read about some n boardn only supporting b/g, so if anyone has any experience working with them I would appreciate it.</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s my understanding that Openwrt does not support any 11n functionality, but the madwifi.org guys are working on it for Atheros based wifi cards. So I would recommend an Atheros based card that may or may not function as a a/b/g card for now, and may get 11n support in the future.</p><p>Bottom line, you may want to hold off on an 11n card, and get a cheap $30 Atheros a/b/g card to hold you over if you can&#039;t wait.</p>									</div>
