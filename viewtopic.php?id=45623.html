It should be from 172.16.1.1-172.16.254.254.<br />You need a tool to scan the network for a node on that network.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Power Device on<br />Wait 5sec<br />Reset Button for 3 secs <br />power light stays on</p></blockquote></div><p>I assume it means that router is not working?

Set your box to something in<br />that range. I cannot say for windows. You could always power down all devices, remove power<br />line and boot it again.
