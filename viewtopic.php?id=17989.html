					<p>Hi,</p><p>On another forum I found reference to a locally available rs232 adapter i picked up at Fry&#039;s Electronics.</p><p>From:<br /><a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/forums/showthread.php?t=15712&amp;page=2">http://www.internettablettalk.com/forum … amp;page=2</a></p><p> ============<br />So back to the thread, I believe we are now on step 3, since I now have a cable! It just so happens Fry&#039;s also has a cables unlimited USB-2925 USB TO 2xDB9 Adapter</p><p>It contains a MOSChip MCS7720 controller. There is a link to the datasheet on the product page. You also get an extra DB9 serial port you can use for something else as an added benefit! The MCS7720 outputs at CMOS level 3.3V so it should interface nice with the tablet. You need to bypass the HIN 213 RS232 line level converter on the PCB. Don&#039;t go straight out from the 12V DB9 port or that will fry the tablet!<br /> ============</p><p>ok, so I&#039;m not much of a hardware hacker.&nbsp; I opened this unit up and took pictures. Photo here:</p><p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/24074654@N04/3095063728/sizes/l/">http://flickr.com/photos/24074654@N04/3 … 8/sizes/l/</a></p><p>Indeed I see two HIN213 chips and a single MCS7720.&nbsp; If I want to go to my router and use 3.3volts, exactly how do I go about bypassing the HIN213 chips?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>I gave up on this cable, too tiny of surface mount pads.&nbsp; The $4 Nokia DKU-5 proved a lot simpler and cheaper <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>
