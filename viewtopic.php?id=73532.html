					<p>Hi, everyone:</p><br /><p>I&#039;ve been using a very old DD-WRT router <strong>SL-R7202</strong> for quite a bit of time, it just looks like its sibling <strong>SL-R7205</strong>, please refer to the old openwrt wiki: wiki.openwrt.org/toh/widemac/sl-r7205.<br />On my <strong>SL-R7202</strong>, its firmware version is NOW:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Firmware: DD-WRT v24-sp2 (10/10/09) std</p></blockquote></div><br /><p>According to the summary at openwrt hardware data: openwrt.org/toh/hwdata/widemac/widemac_sl-r7205, the brand is named <strong>Widemac</strong>.&nbsp; I actually tried to upgrade from dd-wrt firmware directly to openwrt firmware <strong>lede-17.01.4-ramips-rt305x-sl-r7205-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin</strong>, but failed.</p><br /><p>Can anybody give me a hand on what is the <strong>WORKABLE OpenWRT firmware</strong> that I can upgrade to on my <strong>SL-R7202</strong> ?</p><br /><p>Thank you very much...<br />Pei</p>									</div>

					<p>This may or may not be the cause of your problem:<br /><a href="https://openwrt.org/supported_devices/432_warning">https://openwrt.org/supported_devices/432_warning</a><br />I also seem to remember that for some routers you first have to reinstall the original firmware, and then flash OpenWrt. I don&#039;t know if this is the case for your router.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tunk</strong> on 13 Mar 2018, 17:49)</p>
