					<p>As for convenience, stability and performance, I still have to recommend the D-Link DIR-505. It&#039;s hard to beat for a complete package: Built-in power supply (multi-country plug, doubles as a convenient USB charger -- just don&#039;t set it to &quot;Charge&quot; mode or it will <em>only</em> be a charger), virtually unbrickable (emergency flash facility in Uboot), and a wired port (still preferrable to a Wifi if the hotel offers it, or <em>only</em> offers it) make it still my go-to device.</p><p>I own and run some of the alternatives, namely the WT1520 (a lesser WT3020) and the zsun. And while they are great devices and I never had any problems with them, they just don&#039;t offer the complete package the DIR-505 offers for traveling.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 1 Jun 2016, 23:11)</p>
