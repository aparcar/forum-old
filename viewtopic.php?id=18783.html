					<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>I have OpenWrt in a linksys WRT54GL and I tried to vi the /bin/sh and I got a segmentation fault. After that connection was closed and when I try to ssh in again I cannot do it. It doesn&#039;t answer even to pings. In addition, power led is blinking all the time and DMZ led doesn&#039;t go off after rebooting. Failsafe mode works.</p><p>I am writing to you in order to ask you for some advice. I would reload the firmware and start all over again, but I wanted to ask first, just in case.</p><p>Thank you so much. And sorry for any inconvenience.</p><p>Regards.</p>									</div>
