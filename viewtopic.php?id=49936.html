					<p>Here is the solution I found.&nbsp; Hopefully it can help someone else.</p><p>In the Makefile for Luci at /contrib/package/luci (the Makefile used by the feed)</p><p>Is a line near the top:</p><p>ifeq ($(USELOCAL),1)<br />&nbsp; PKG_VERSION:=0.11.1</p><p>If you change (increment, I added the .1 for example)) the PKG_VERSION the OpenWRT build seems to assume there is a new version and grabs the update source.</p><p>John</p>									</div>
