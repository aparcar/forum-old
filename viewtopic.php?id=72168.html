					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I am using Openrt BB. I have compiled the source code and used it on one of ramips board, It worked well as expected. Then i added few scripts in etc and lib and tried to test run this by not flashing it but instead only running it from ram. I am using uBoot option 1 to download it via tftp and run in ram. it ran but the scripts were not present. When i load the same image into flash it ran properly with those scripts present. once you have flashed those images and then try again run it from ram it showed up the scripts. when the older image with absence of scripts is flashed again ant tried to run again from ram with the new image, the scripts again disappeared. </p><p>My question is <br />1. why does it does not show up those scripts when ran it from ram?<br />2. What should i do to test the new additions without flashing it in real and running in ram instead.<br />3.Also is it possible not to flash any image and whenever router reboots it does the tftp from the lan connected to it and downloads the image in ram and run with its defaults settings.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vikaspshinde</strong> on 27 Sep 2017, 08:23)</p>
