					<p>Hello everybody!<br />I&#039;ve been using BARRIER BREAKER (14.07, r42625) on the tp-link mr3020 for some time and I have a question:</p><p>I compilled some c sources ( a scheduler ) I&#039;ve developed, there are 5 programs that talks to each other using shared memory (shmget):</p><p>run_task ( takes care of the schedule and parses the commands from the other 4 programs )<br />add_task ( add a new task )<br />remove_task ( remove a task )<br />end_tasks ( remove all tasks )<br />list_task ( show a list with all added tasks )</p><p>They are working as expected when I login via putty and execute them into bash.</p><p>Now the problem:</p><p>I have this script ( new_task.sh ) on the init.d:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common
# Example script
# Copyright (C) 2007 OpenWrt.org

START=99
STOP=15

start() {
        #echo start
        # commands to launch application
        cd /scheduler/
        ./run_task &amp;
        ./add_task 18:30 front.sh 12:00
}

stop() {
        #echo stop
        # commands to kill application
        killall run_task
}

restart(){
        #echo restart
        #commands to restart the application
        killall run_task
        cd /scheduler/
        ./run_task &amp;
        ./add_task 18:30 front.sh 12:00
}</code></pre></div><p>The symlink is on the rc.d as S99new_task.sh</p><p>I&#039;ve made a test and I know that the daemon ( run_task ) is working good, and that the added task is doing it&#039;s job. I can remove/add tasks, and end all the tasks with no problem, however, when I try to see the task list by doing: </p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>./scheduler/list_task</p></blockquote></div><p> I see nothing and I should see the list on the busybox bash with the added tasks. </p><p>If I do: </p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>/etc/init.d/new_task.sh restart</p></blockquote></div><p> and after do: </p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>./scheduler/list_task</p></blockquote></div><p> I see the list on the bash and everything works fine. The same is true when I start the program and add tasks manually. It works as expected.</p><p>Is this problem related to runlevel? <br />How can I redirect the output of my daemon ( run_task ) - started by the init process - to the busybox bash?</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Ps: I tried the rc.local method to autostart the daemon and the result is the same as with the init.d/rc.d method.</p><p>Update: This problem I have seems a lot like when you start a program in one session and then open another session and do a command to the process started in the first session. The output will be on the first session. In my case I think that the output could be going to the serial console ( didn&#039;t check this yet ) that&#039;s up before the busybox itself, once my daemon is starting at boot time. If that&#039;s the case, there&#039;s a way to change the output to the busybox session instead the serial console?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>evilmonkey</strong> on 5 Apr 2016, 02:16)</p>
