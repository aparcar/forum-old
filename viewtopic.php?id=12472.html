					<p>Hey all.</p><p>I have got my hands on a bricked WRT54GL v1.1. Here are my symptoms:</p><p>- The power light flashes, on keeps on flashing for ever, about twice a second.<br />- All my LAN ports light constantly.<br />- When I plug a cable from my pc into one of the LAN ports, Windows doesn&#039;t detect the connection, not even that the cable is plugged in, neither does an old 10mbit hub.</p><p>I tried to shortcut pin 16 and 17 on the flashram chip, in order to tftp a new firmware to the router, but without success. The LAN ports doesn&#039;t get up.</p><p>I tried flashing the CFE and the NVRAM using a homemade jtag cable and Hairydairymaid v48, and the operation succeeds. Then I unplug the powercable, wait for about 10 seconds and plug it back in, and the router has the exact same symptoms. No changes. Do I do this right?</p><p>Thanks in advance for your answers.</p><p>Regards BQffen</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello</p><p>You might want to wait a little longer (about a minute) before disconnecting JTAG and rebooting.</p><p>I&#039;ve not much of a solution else but I&#039;m having the same problem with my WRT54GL v1.1. <br />I bricked it by doing the following:<br />1. <em>nvram unset variable</em> for every variable by hand<br />2. <em>nvram commit</em><br />3. flashed the original firmware with webif</p><p>The whole procedure without any reboot. And don&#039;t ask why I did those things... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>After doing so, the power led was flashing and some lan ports and the wan port were lighted up.</p><br /><p>Back then (was quite some time ago) I did:<br />- Erasing the whole flash and then flash the appropriate cfe from skynet.<br />- Erasing the whole flash and then flash the inappropriate cfe (WRT54GL v1.0)<br />Nothing worked. That was about some months ago.</p><p>Yesterday, once again, I erased the whole flash and then tried differend CFEs:<br />WRT54GL v1.1, WRT54GL v1.0, WRT54G v4.0 from skynet and from lonewolf<br />Always with erasing the nvram and kernel sections afterwards.</p><p>Well, and there I am, still the same state (right now power led is flashing, lan 2-4 and wan are lighted up).<br />Since I reread the flashed images and compared them with md5sum I&#039;m sure the JTAG cable is working.</p><p>Yesterday I read all the threads about WRT54GL and CFE problems, but found nothing I haven&#039;t already tried yet. But we&#039;re definitively not the only ones having this problem.</p><p>I could suggest what I&#039;m probably going to do, soldering a serial port to the board and checking if there is an error message.</p><p>Regards, Moskito</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Moskito</strong> on 14 Sep 2007, 14:13)</p>

					<p>Sounds like your problem is quite semilar to mine.</p><p>A coulpe of days ago I managed to revive my WRT54GL. Don&#039;t ask my what I did different from my other attempts.</p><p>Previously I tried with different CFE&#039;s, that I found different places on the internet, all addressed to the WRT54GL v1.1, but none of them worked.</p><p>The next day i decided to try again. I connected the router via JTAG and flashed it again with:</p><p>wrt54g -erase:wholeflash /noemw<br />wrt54g -flash:CFE /noemw</p><p>The funny thing is that I used the CFE.BIN that I backed up, right after i soldered the JTAG cable on the router.</p><p>At first sight it didn&#039;t seem to work, but after a couple of minuttes the LAN leds was acting proberly again. After this I was able to tftp a new firmware to the router, and now everything works fine.</p><p>I hope this helps some of you out there.</p>									</div>
