					<p>IÂ´d like to develop code that runs on OpenWRT. </p><p>I intend to write, test and debug on a PC with Linux, and then use Buildroot to &quot;port&quot; to my router with OpenWRT.</p><p>Question: What Linux distribution is more suitable for this? <br />OR... Which is closest to OpenWRT core?<br />OR... What flavor of Linux is OpenWRT based on?</p><p>errr... any other advice?</p><p>My application is basically a client/server that reads data from RS232 interface, do some tweaking on it, and send by TCP.<br />RS232 will be provided by USB adapter or TTL port of router. to be defined...</p><p>Thanks!!!</p>									</div>

					<p>Doesn&#039;t really matter what you do for linux distro, because you are cross compiling anyway.<br />The tutorials are based mostly on ubuntu, however I used debian without issues as well.<br />Only diff is that some packages you need for the distro are named a bit differently (not that much).</p>									</div>

					<p>&quot;write, test and debug on a PC with Linux&quot; using what tools?</p><p>On the smallest openWrt devices (4MB flash), you can &quot;read data from RS232 interface, do some tweaking on it, and send by TCP&quot; using shell script or lua.&nbsp; With an 8MB device, you can install PHP (or could have some years ago--PHP may have grown).</p><p>If you want to write in C, you&#039;ll generally need to cross-compile.</p><p>What is it that you really need to do?&nbsp; That might provide guidance as to the best tools available for openWrt devices of different capacities.</p><p>If you just want to monitor RS232 (or usb/serial) and send it elsewhere for further processing, a simple shell script can do that.&nbsp; Here&#039;s an example I use with time stamping and local logging.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

done</code></pre></div><p>This runs on a Poray M3 device with 4MB flash and 16MB ram.&nbsp; Serial input consists of 4 space-separated items of data terminated with a linefeed. Each input line gets timestamped, logged locally, and forwarded.</p><p>I have 7 other devices (WR703Ns, Dockstars running debian, and an x86 Atom running Ubuntu) similarly monitoring usb/serial lines from microprocessors and sending all to 192.168.1.70 using nc (mostly wirelessly).</p><p>My openWrt build system is the x86 running Ubuntu.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lizby</strong> on 27 Apr 2013, 14:34)</p>
