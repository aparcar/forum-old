					<p>Hey there! I just got a new router and thus I wanted to experiment with my old router, the Sitecom WL-351. This is the first time I have ever tried to install custom firmware on a router. <br />I am following this wiki page: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/sitecom/wl-351">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/sitecom/wl-351</a></p><p>Alright, so the problem I am having is that even though I can receive information from the router, I can&#039;t send any keystrokes to it. After trying both wires and headers, resoldering them both multiple times and testing the connections multiple times with a continuity tester I am certain the solder connections are good. <br />I don&#039;t think it is the USB-to-Serial adapter I use either as I have tried it with both my adapter and an Arduino (with 3v3 lvl converter). With both devices the TX light is flickering.</p><p>I have no clue what I am doing wrong, or how I can solve this and I hope someone can help me with this problem.</p><p>This is the output I get from the router.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>@

					<p>Patch needed to get the WL-351 image to work again:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[PATCH] Fix up switch settings for Sitecom WL-351 v1 002

Pinmux for rgmii needs to be set to rgmii, not gpio.
Hide the ESW switch on boot (using new rgmii esw devicetree attribute).
Also add a Sitecom-specific profile, since the image needs to include
the rtl8366 kernel driver.

					<p>Right, got file to exchange but flash doesn&#039;t happen, I&#039;ll post the output later but it basically says something is too old in the image compares to what i already have and it doesn&#039;t take. I&#039;ve waited ten minutes after the file transfer completes, restarted the router and it&#039;s still the same as before.</p><p>Only thing I can think of now is whether anyone out there has an old sitecom firmware i can try and downgrade with before trying the openwrt again.</p>									</div>
