The version in 15.05.1 needs a reboot at least every 24 hours to not degrade to a total crawl. There were several performance improvements for AC in later versions but they don&#039;t make the difference between crap and usable. The last version by Nemo is in my book among the first usable.</p><p>Still hoping for a proper 15.05.2 with all the other goodies.</p>									</div>

					<p>thanks to everyone for your selfless help with this one!<br />The issue is exactly as you said - that is, incompatible file formats. I took a USB stick, formatted it as ext4 and it mounted perfectly from LuCi.<br />Thanks again - I&#039;ll mark this as solved!</p>									</div>
