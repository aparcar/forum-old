					<p>I just tried building Kamikaze from the svn trunk and failed miserably.</p><p>I followed the instructions in <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/docs/openwrt.html">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/docs/openwrt.html</a><br />There are some problems with the documentation, such as the instructions for symlinking all modules (the command as presented creates broken links, and symlinking all modules properly causes &quot;make menuconfig&quot; to fail: &quot;file /home/anon/openwrt/packages/net/samba3/Config.in already scanned?&nbsp; make: *** [menuconfig] Error 1&quot;).</p><p>Basically I ended up building without any modules at all.&nbsp; I took the resulting trx file and reflashed my wrt54gs with it.&nbsp; Upon rebooting and setting the root password, I discovered that ipkg was not installed, so I couldn&#039;t install any modules at this point.&nbsp; A grep through the source distribution shows ipkg-tools as part of the standard build and not a separate module, so I&#039;m not sure what is going wrong with my build.</p><p>How do I make a build that works like the standard kamikaze 7.09 image in the download section?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi.</p><p>1) You can consider the symlink method deprecated. Use the following commands instead:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>./scripts/feeds update
./scripts/feeds install -a</code></pre></div><p>This will &quot;symlink&quot; all available packages into your buildroot</p><p>2) The &quot;ipkg&quot; package manager was replaced by &quot;opkg&quot;. It has the same syntax as former ipkg.</p><p>~ JoW</p>									</div>
