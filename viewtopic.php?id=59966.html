					<p>Hi everyone,<br />I guess I just bricked my brand new WRT1900AC when I installed the firmware (using the router upgrade firmware option) for the wrong version (I have a V1 and installed the V2 firmware). I now just have a router with a green blinking light... ugh...<br />I read in the wiki that I could unbrick it by using a USB to TTL serial cable. Is this possible? If so, does anyone have a link for the cable I need to get in ebay/amazon? I read there are cables with different pitches and I would like to get the right one.<br />Thanks!</p>									</div>
