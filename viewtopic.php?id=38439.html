					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am facing an issue with my wr703n when the #G connection is dropped for some reason. Reconnection fails.</p><p>The only way to recover from this status is to poweroff and poweron the little box, as the soft reset does not reset the USB power, leaving th USB pen with teh same status.</p><p>Is there any way to issue a USB reset from command line, to for the 3G to re-register in the network?</p><p>Thanks for you help.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, maybe I&#039;ve put the question too much specific.</p><p>Is there any solution to solve the issue with USB device for 3G connection?</p><p>-Symptom: When connection is dropped, modem is unable to reconnect. Even with watchdog enabled, the router reboots, but does not reset the usb port, leaving the USB device status unchanged.<br />My guess is that the 3G device must re-register with the network, and either because the reboot does not reset usb or because the correct AT commands aren&#039;t issued, currently the only solution is to bounce power supply.</p><p>Does anyone know the required AT commands to reset the 3G pen? And how to send them...</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
