					<p>Hmm, too bad there&#039;s no &quot;Other Routers&quot; forum.</p><p>The interesting thing about <a href="http://trendnet.com/products/TEW-511BRP.htm">these guys</a> are that they come dual-band (802.11a/g) and are running $50 shipped after rebate this month from Newegg.</p><p>I have one on order because I dearly want to do 5GHz for a &#039;customer&#039; in a crowded urban area.&nbsp; Not sure if I&#039;ll be able to rip it open for a peek; I can&#039;t go voiding any warranties.</p><p>I assume these are Atheros-based, given the &quot;Super AG&quot; branding and a string in the firmware image -- &quot;AccessPoint_5312_01&quot;.&nbsp; Probably not too much Flash, hard to say what the native OS is.</p><p>The same company also makes some interesting wired NAS boxes that have GPL sources available -- and do what I&#039;d intended to do if I&#039;d shoved a tri-mode card into a USB-capable router, so I guess I&#039;m a bit soothed there.&nbsp; [<a href="http://trendnet.com/products/f_storageservers.htm">Link.</a>]</p><br /><p><em>Edit:</em>&nbsp; Forgot to search the forums for &quot;Trendnet&quot; first.&nbsp; Atheros sure does make the 5312, so I&#039;d assume these aren&#039;t as similar to the 411BRP(+?)s as the numbering might suggest.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Floid</strong> on 3 Nov 2005, 16:31)</p>

					<p>I think you are right that there ought to be an &quot;Other Routers&quot; forum.&nbsp; In general, I think the forum needs to be reorganized a bit into a few more main topic areas.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yep.&nbsp; In other news, it&#039;s becoming clear that this should be a twin to the Linksys WR55AGv2 -- the same string&#039;s present in the firmware to both.</p>									</div>
