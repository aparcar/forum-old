					<p>I have a DSL line w/static IP addresses assigned by my ISP. I&#039;d like to take one of those static IP addresses and connect it to a WRT54G v2 box, which would then be an AP and DHCP server for a couple wireless and wired clients. I have heard that OpenWrt is a much more stable and reliable solution than using the Linksys firmware, but I still have a lot to learn!</p><p>Questions:</p><p>1) Can you use the WAN port on the device while plugged into an Ethernet switch, rather than directly into a DSL router? So if I want to statically assign an address to the WAN port, can I do that?<br />2) If I can do #1, can I then run both wired and wireless clients (same subnet is fine) using a DHCP server on the Linksys box?</p><p>Thanks in advance for answering what are probably simple questions to many of you.</p><p>John</p>									</div>

					<p>I should add that ideally I want to be able to port-forward from the outside address through the WRT54G to a Web server running on the LAN.</p>									</div>
