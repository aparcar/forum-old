					<p>I&#039;ve been trying to get any upnp media server to work on a nslu2 with openwrt (2.6.21.6 #2 arm5teb ).&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried miniupnp but even though it showed in ps -aux as running, I couldn&#039;t see it from any client. Then I tried gmediaserver thinking it would be more robust, but the init.d script errors out with invalid address&nbsp; or interface name &#039;br-lan&#039;.&nbsp; My ifconfig only shows eth0 and lo.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing br-lan is more for routers, this is just the nslu2.</p><p>Any recommedations? thanks in advance. If I can&#039;t get miniupnp or gmediaserver I guess the next step would try something like twonky.</p>									</div>
