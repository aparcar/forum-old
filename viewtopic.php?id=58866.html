					<p>Hello!</p><p>I&#039;ve just bought a TL-WDR4300 because I wanted to get some extra gigabit speed for my local network, but I&#039;m having problems with it.</p><p>First of all, my current (or is it the old one now?) setup is a TL-WR740N with Barrier Breaker, and it works flawlessly. Never had to reboot it or anything, connection is always perfectly stable.</p><p>Now, I just got my TL-WDR4300 yesterday, and the first thing I did was flash it with Barrier Breaker. It worked, I configured it as I needed (same as the old one), nothing fancy, just some reserved IP address, hostnames and a port forwarding.</p><p>Then I noticed that once in a while my internet connection just suddenly drops. Nothing responds. Pings result in timeouts. It stays like that for some seconds (like 20, 30s) and then it comes back up, as it was a minute ago. Works normally for a time (a few minutes), and then drops again.</p><p>First of all I tried connecting through ethernet, and doing the ping tests directly on the router itself (via SSH), and the problem seems to be between the router and the internet. Another piece of evidence is that local connections don&#039;t suffer from this issue.</p><p>I researched on google and found this topic:https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=47689<br />Which prompted me to try the trunk image of Chaos Calmer. So I went and flashed it (downloaded image today, august 05, 2015), but it didn&#039;t solve the issue.</p><p>My last hope was stock firmware. But I just tried it and it has the same issues.</p><p>Do you guys have any idea of what&#039;s happening? I&#039;m running out of ideas here. Is this a broken router? Should I just return it and get a replacement? Or maybe the problem is some incompatibility with the internet modem and I can&#039;t use a WDR 4300?</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>

					<p>I have a modem (supplied by my ISP) which handles the internet connection and is also a router. I have my WDR4300 connected to it using a static IP address (same setup as I had with the WR740N). The ISP modem/router has other devices connected to it.</p><p>Details: the ISP modem/router uses the 192.168.25.0/24 subnet, with DHCP giving addresses in the range 100-200, and the WDR4300 with a static IP of 192.168.25.99 (WAN port). The subnets in the WDR4300 are 192.168.1.0/24 (with OpenWRT) and 192.168.0.0/24 (with stock firmware).</p><p>I&#039;m at work right now, so I&#039;ll check the modem logs when I get home!</p><p>One more thing: just after I posted yesterday I tried an alternate configuration that came to mind: use the WDR4300 behind the WR740N (yes, triple nat, I&#039;ll burn in hell). So I had a 192.168.0.0/24 subnet (WDR4300) connecting to a 192.168.1.0/24 subnet using DHCP (WR740N) connecting to a 192.168.25.0/24 subnet (the ISP modem) using a static address.</p><p>The result was: a much better connection! I&#039;m performing the following test: &quot;ping -s 1450 -c 500 8.8.8.8&quot;. With the WR740N alone (my original setup), I had zero packets lost. With the the WDR4300 alone, I always had more than 30% packet loss (always in sequence). With the triple nat setup I explained above, I had only 3% packet loss (and scattered throughout the test, the connecting didn&#039;t suddenly drop).</p><p>I&#039;m thinking about testing the same setup but using the WDR4300 in bridge mode, getting rid of one nat. I suspect it will work wonderfully. But seems a bit of a waste to use a WR740N as a router when I have a WDR4300 sitting next to it and used as a switch.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m trying to find the ISP modem/router logs, but I can&#039;t find them. There are some system events, but all related to DHCP leases (all messages like this: &quot;wlan : dhcp link-up assignAddr=192.168.25.4&quot;).</p><p>But I got the device model: it&#039;s a D-Link DSL-2740E.</p><p>Now I&#039;ll try using the WDR4300 in bridge mode, I&#039;ll post the results soon.</p>									</div>

					<p>hi<br />check again maybe in 3 routers configuration maybe you connected to the old one and not 4300<br />as you discribed it the problems seem familiar to 1043nd family - all droping wifi after a while <br />as a fix i restart wifi once a day, seems much better like this</p>									</div>

					<p>After a couple of far too busy months, I finally got a chance to try and fix this.</p><p>And guess what, part of the problem was me being stupid <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>It so happens that my TL-WR740N was NOT using static IP! Just address reservation!</p><p>So I changed the TL-WDR4300 to use DHCP too and everything worked, so it seems that this router has no problems at all.</p><p>The real problem lies with the Modem-router DSL-2740E, which apparently doesn&#039;t work well when mixing DHCP and static IP clients. But this device isn&#039;t that great, and on top of everything it seems to be using a custom firmware from my ISP, so I won&#039;t even bother trying to solve this, I&#039;ll just keep using address reservation.</p><p>Thanks for the support anyway!</p>									</div>
