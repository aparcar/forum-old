					<p>I have a US Robotics USR 5461.&nbsp; I flashed it via TFTP to OpenWRT (the image was here: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/7.09/brcm47xx-2.6/)">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/7 â€¦ 47xx-2.6/)</a>.&nbsp; After flashing, the router would not respond, so I tried to get into failsafe mode.&nbsp; It broadcasts the message like it is supposed to, but hitting reset just resets the box and results in the failsafe message being resent.</p><p>Please help.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I got a prompt.&nbsp; I never did get the failsafe to work.&nbsp; Nor did I get the bootloader to reflash the memory.&nbsp; I think it is listening, but for a very short time (telnet sometimes returns 1-3 responses early in the boot process).&nbsp; It seems that OpenWRT really is on there, but it is soooo slooow.&nbsp; OpenWRT isn&#039;t based on Vista is it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> ?&nbsp; It takes 5 min just to boot.&nbsp; Getting a telnet prompt is another 5 min job.&nbsp; Even simple things like echo take a surprising amount of time (several seconds).&nbsp; And complicated things like ls, well I never did see the results of that one.&nbsp; </p><p>So, I guess I&#039;ll see what boot_wait looks like and try enabling it if is disabled, then try reflashing using the bootloader.&nbsp; If that fails, I&#039;ll try reflashing using OpenWRT.&nbsp; Anybody have a better method than <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Installing">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Installing</a> (the method with downloading from the internet)?&nbsp; Maybe I could setup a private http server, just to make sure nothing gets corrupted.</p>									</div>
