					<p>Hello guys! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I&#039;m thinking about making wireless thermostat for my central heating.<br />I would like to use two ESP8266 modules. One with thermal sensor (DS18B20) and second with relay.<br />I would like to connect them to my home wifi. And because I have router with OpenWRT, I&#039;m thinking about using MQTT protocol and MQTT server Mosquitto on the OpenWRT. I hope that it shouldn&#039;t be big problem, but it&#039;s possible to make some small HTTP server on the OpenWRT, where I would be able to read data from the MQQT and set e.g. the wanted temperature or time when it should work?</p><p>Is there anyone who tried something with the MQTT or HTTP server already?</p><p>Thank you <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi there, we are on the same boat!</p><p>I am still planing and toying with the ESP&#039;s, but so far all pieces are beginning to match fine. I configured a separate wifi network for the IOT, for security reasons. I have also installed Mosquitto on the OpenWrt router, to send / receive messages from / to the ESPs, and I can send / receive messages from / to a PC, too.</p><p>For the web interface, I am planning on a OpenHab sever; but it is far too heavy for the OpenWrt router, so I am planning to install it on a Raspberry Pi.</p>									</div>

					<p>Nice to see someone with the same idea! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Can you share pls more info about how you made the MQTT connection?<br />I&#039;m working with Arduino IDE and I&#039;m thinking about using PubSubClient...</p><p>I was also wondering about the OpenHub, but yes, it&#039;s too &quot;heavy&quot;. But now I&#039;m thinking about running a small HTML web site directly on the ESP8266...</p><p>But I&#039;m really interest in how to read the MQTT data and show them on HTML <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m also using the Arduino IDE and the PubSubClient. There are examples of MQTT clients that read messages from the server, and there are examples that create a HTTP server; I guess you just have to mix them together...</p>									</div>
