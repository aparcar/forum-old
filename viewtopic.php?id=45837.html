					<p>Which WAN bug? Do you have any bug? Do not upgrade if you are fine with Backfire.<br />AA has WiFi bug: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=42539">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=42539</a><br />BB is the way to go, for now, for just now or whatever...

					<p>Mine is 1.8 and didn&#039;t have this bug. As Nilfred says, though, its AA on this router has wifi bug on 1.8 and above. You would probably be best staying on Backfire.</p>									</div>
