					<p>Has anyone tried the latest Kamikaze release (7.07) with the Meraki&#039;s stage2?</p><p>I can&#039;t get it to work.&nbsp; I already fixed the two obvious problems (magic eight byte header, wrong baud rate), and the same kernel works if I decompress it on my host system and load it via tftp.&nbsp; The stage2 loader prints &quot;starting linux&quot; and a carriage return and then stops.&nbsp; I even dumped RAM after rebooting the Meraki right after it locks up, and it looks like the decompressor did something sensible.&nbsp; It&#039;s hard to be sure though, since the RAM develops errors very quickly when you don&#039;t power it :-)</p><p>I have three Meraki boxes to set up and I was hoping to do it without messing with the RedBoot config, just because it will be easier to go back this way.&nbsp; But unless someone knows what I&#039;m doing wrong, I&#039;ll probably drop in a gzipped kernel instead tomorrow.</p>									</div>
