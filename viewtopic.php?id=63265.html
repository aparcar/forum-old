					<p>Good day!</p><p>I&#039;ve got a problem with <strong>TL-WR940N V 2.0</strong> router - I don&#039;t remember password for root user. I&#039;ve got OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment 12.09 with Luci.</p><p>Router works fine, but I need to make some settings. In normal mode it&#039;s set up with static IP <strong>10.10.98.85</strong>. Web interface works fine except I can&#039;t login. SSH works fine too, but also I can&#039;t log in. Telnet gives me &quot;Connection refused&quot;.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried to make a hard reset, but it didn&#039;t work:<br />0. Set up IP on my PC (tried both 192.168.1.1 with mask 255.255.255.0 and 10.10.98.85 with mask 255.255.255.0)<br />1. Powered off router and plugged out WAN cable.<br />2. Connected PC&#039;s lan cable to Lan port #1 on router.<br />3. Powered on router.<br />4. When SYS led started to blink I&#039;ve pressed my WPS/RESET button.<br />5. SYS led started to blink faster and it&#039;s in a failsafe mode.</p><p>And that&#039;s all:<br />- Lan port #1 not blinking on router;<br />- no ping (tried both - default 192.168.1.1 and current router IP 10.10.98.85);<br />- no telnet connection - &quot;Could not open connection to the host, on port 23: Connect failed&quot;;<br />- SSH - &quot;Network error: Connection timed out.&quot;;</p><p>After turning off and on router boots up in normal mode with my current settings.</p><p>How can I reset all settings?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>LPervak</strong> on 10 Mar 2016, 13:21)</p>
