For the lan side this is forced as static simply due to a configuration bug in the linksys firmware that leaves the default as dhcp. pppoe support is not fully implemented.</p><p><strong>lan_ifname</strong><br />Single interface name that the lan_* variables apply to. Note that the definition of the lan side is pretty much arbitrary and does not need to reflect the actual port labels.</p><p><strong>lan_ifnames</strong><br />If lan_ifname (note the distinction) is br0 (bridge) this lists all the interfaces to be grouped in the bridge. see footnote.</p><p><strong>- footnotes </strong><br />The same pattern repeats for wan_ and also wifi_. The wifi_ prefix was just made up so we&#039;d have somewhere to configure the wireless if we decided not to bridge ethernet and wireless under the lan heading.</p><p>Also of importance is the fact that the interface names changed between the v1.x and v2.x hardware. 1.x hid the vlan configuration in the driver and created a false eth0 and eth1, 2.x simply has an eth0 which requires vlans. Openwrt uses the 2.x ethernet drivers which means that we now have to create the vlan interfaces. The short version of this is that the networking script has a few lines to detect 1.x hardware and remap the interface names to vlans. We suggest keeping the original interface names to ease the transition between different firmwares, although the script will happily accept the vlan names.</p></blockquote></div><p>Note the lack of firewall settings. While there is nvram variables for the firewall their format in nvram is rather restrictive, which is why OpenWrt uses a firewall.sh script in nvram instead.</p><p>Back on topic:<br />There are no plans to use a debian style ifup/ifdown, OpenWrt&#039;s stance is pretty much to use the nvram variables when design allows. Specifically, we will not store the above network configuration variables on jffs nor will we do an &quot;ifup &lt;interface&gt;&quot; since the settings aren&#039;t stored on a per interface basis. Modifying the networking scripts to be able to do &quot;ifup lan&quot; however is possible, and would be a rather minimal change.</p><p>(I should clarify that I&#039;m speaking of the openwrt core only, if you want to do your own networking scripts feel free to)</p>									</div>

So, OpenWrt invents a set of variables wifi_ifname, wifi_ipaddr, wifi_netmask, etc. to solve the problem; these variables are really only interesting in the case where the wireless needs to be configured separately from the lan.</p><p>(There are no wlan_* variables in the linksys firmware)</p>									</div>

					<p>I had troubles setting up the wlan-interface using (purely) iwconfig. It worked in unencrypted mode, but when using wep my client (powerbook with osx) failed to recognize that the network is encrypted. </p><p>It would allow me to (sucessfully) join the network, but of course it couldn&#039;t actually exchange data, because the AP ignored the unencrypted packet emitted by the client.</p><p>When using wlconf (and the nvram-variables) to setup the interface everything worked find, and my client would prompt me for a wep-key when trying to join the network.</p><p>The solution was to modify my iwconfig call - more precisly to put the wep-settings BEFORE the essid. I analyzed the wlconf and the iwconfig source - looks like iwconfig processes the argument in the same order as they are written on the command line. wlconf always follows the same order, and basically<br />.) Unsets the essid (According to the comment to detach from any accesspoint if in client mode)<br />.) Sets the channel<br />.) Sets the mode (master, client, ...)<br />.) Sets the security settings<br />.) Configures the essid.</p><p>Seems like the wlan-driver (partially) depends on this order - after rearranging the order of the iwconfig arguments to reflect the order used by wlconf, things suddenly worked.</p><p>These are the commands I use to bring up the wireless interface, and so far things seem to work properly.</p><p>ifconfig eth2 up<br />iwconfig eth2 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; channel 6 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mode master <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; key &lt;wep-key&gt; restricted <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; essid &lt;essid&gt;</p><p>If someone knows how to configure WDS-links without using the (closed-source) &quot;wl&quot; app (not included in openwrt, but in the original linksys firmware), I&#039;d like to hear it.</p>									</div>

And wds is also able to be set with the hostap-utils. At least, there is something good having a 1.0 HW.</p><p>Cheers,<br />Nils</p>									</div>
