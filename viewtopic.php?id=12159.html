					<p>Hi,</p><p>This is my 1st post on this forum, so I should welcom you all <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I have a problem with my linksys. After some time i tried to login to it, but with no success. The password/login is missmatching.</p><p>So first step was to go to failsafe and look into telnet. I loginto, remount to RW and passwd. No result - still asking for password. So the next step was to RW and vi /etc/passwd and paste string from another WRT - no result - still asking for password (password is wrong).</p><p>Finally I&#039;ve made erase nvram. All settings went to default (ssid, ip, etc) except root password. After 1st logging WR is not asking for new root&#039;s password, but displaying username and password fields.</p><p>Can anyone help mi with this situation ?</p><p>P.S.<br />Linksys was working fine, but I wanned to switch in pppoe from allways connected to connect on demand as it was disconnecting for some time and not connecting again.</p>									</div>
