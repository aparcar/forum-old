					<p>I looked briefly and couldn&#039;t find information about this.&nbsp; If it already exists, my apologies and if you&#039;ll just point me in the right direction, I&#039;ll start reading there.</p><p>I&#039;m interested in just about anything/everything that will work on the routers that have USB devices (particularly interested in the Asus WL-500g Premium): cameras/GPS devices/sound devices/serial ports/video adapters (these probably haven&#039;t been reverse-engineered for Linux yet, but worth a try)/keyboards/etc etc.</p><p>Also, if anybody has used a router + OpenWRT as any sort of computer in their car, I&#039;d like to read about issues regarding this.&nbsp; Any of these routers compatible with standard cigarette lighter power adapters? Obviously you can use a power inverter, but that wastes some power, I assume.&nbsp; </p><p>Any cheap display devices that could be used?&nbsp; Perhaps 2 or 4-line LCD display controlled through serial port?</p><br /><p>Thanks,<br />Nate</p>									</div>

					<p>aaaaaand I just realized the Wiki (which I didn&#039;t notice at first) is going to answer many of my questions.</p><p>I&#039;d still like to hear what people have to say about any of the stuff in my post, though.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Nate</p>									</div>
