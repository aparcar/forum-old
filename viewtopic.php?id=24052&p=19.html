					<p>Hi Lundman I also live in Japan (Yokohama) and have just subscribed to StrongVPN<br />and they suggested I buy a Buffalo WZR HP G450H but the girl at Yodobashi said that has been superceeded with<br />WZR-450HP so I bought one. Now I have gone back to StrongVpn and they are asking does it support DD-WRT without which I cannot set up a router using their service. Do you or anyone on the forum know if DD-WRT is<br />supported on this latest model ?<br />Ian</p>									</div>

I wasn&#039;t able to do a tftp install, probably because of the locked U-boot mentioned in this forum and elsewhere, but I was able to do an mtd system upgrade from within an ssh session on the DD-WRT profesional firmware the router came with. (which I could tftp install just fine). As an important note, after the mtd flash and when the router came up, the red diag light never went off, but I was able to telnet in anyway. Once Luci was up I was able to turn off the red diag light, so it might be that the trunk version I installed just had the light on by default. (I installed OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment r32793)</p></blockquote></div><p>I think this needs to be on the WZR-HP-G300NH page in big red letters. I ran mtd system upgrade; I tried to get on the web page (I didn&#039;t realize that the image doesn&#039;t have Luci); then I looked at the router and I saw diag light red; I rebooted - the light was still red - and I panicked. I tried to reset it, including 30/30/30 reset. Nothing helped - and I ended up returning the router.<br />The replacement router behaved the same (mtd upgrade successful, but the dial light was solid red). However, just like kowallis, I was able to telnet, change password, ssh, install Luci, and I am now in. There is a page of LED settings - so I turned diag off. I am still tinkering with the settings (I replaced old Linksys with openwrt on it) - but the main thing, it works fine!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi</p><p>I just got this router Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH v1 Japanese model, and well I&#039;m really disappointed to know that the only language is JP and I can&#039;t change it... I did a search (google) and ended up at the wiki of openwrt.<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr-hp-g300h#locked.u-boot.too.short.time.tftp.window">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr … ftp.window</a><br />More exactly at &quot;Locked U-Boot, too short time TFTP window&quot;.<br />This is what I did...</p><p>1. I connected to the router using that link (<a href="http://your.router.ip.address/cgi-bin/cgi?req=frm&amp;frm=py-db/55debug.html">http://your.router.ip.address/cgi-bin/c … debug.html</a>), and then I enabled the telnet.<br />2. Since I&#039;m using win7x64 and it already has the telnet client, I connected to the router using the &quot;telnet 192.168.11.1&quot;.<br />3. I typed &quot;# ubootenv -h&quot; and then the help list pop out (good...i think...)<br />4. Well, here is thing...I don&#039;t know what to do next!</p><p>Since at the wiki says &quot;Once there, one can use a command &quot;ubootenv&quot; to set above mentioned variables without trouble&quot;, and the steps to enable it to accept others firmwares are &quot;ar7100&gt; setenv accept_open_rt_fmt 1; ar7100&gt; saveenv; ar7100&gt; reset&quot;; I tried:</p><p>1. # ubootenv setenv accept_open_rt_fmt 1 (it showed me that help list again...wrong I think)<br />2. # ubootenv set accept_open_rt_fmt 1 (I THINK it worked since it didn&#039;t showed that help list again, and the # came right after that)<br />3. I was unable to do the others 2 steps (saveenv and reset) since both showed me the help list.</p><p>I was reading the old messeges but I think all of them are talking about serial, tftp, etc... I didn&#039;t find anything about this &quot;easy way&quot; that wiki page was talking about.<br />Can someone please help me with this?<br />And sorry my bad english.<br />Thanks</p><p>EDIT: When I typed &#039;&#039;ubootenv list&quot; the last line showed me this &quot;accept_open_rt_fmt 1&quot;<br />So, can I flash a new firmware (english) to overwrite the old firmware (japanese)?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jacksparrow</strong> on 20 Sep 2012, 18:32)</p>

					<p>Hi </p><p>I desperately need help from a&nbsp; guru !</p><p>I just bricked my router.<br />I have an A0 A1 version, that was running Backfire 10.03.<br />I had wanted to upgrade to Attitude Adjustment (because of Luci broken interface), and uploaded <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-wzr-hp-g300nh-jffs2-sysupgrade.bin.">http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_a … grade.bin.</a> Then I launched the sysupgrade -v /tmp/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-wzr-hp-g300nh-jffs2-sysupgrade.bin command line. Everything seemed to work fine for the 1st part :<br />root@openwrt:/tmp$ sysupgrade -v openwrt-ar71xx-generic-wzr-hp-g300nh-jffs2-sysupgrade.bin<br />Saving config files...<br />root/statistics<br />[...]<br />Unlocking firmware ...</p><p>I get some &quot;[w]&quot; and &quot;[e]&quot; displayed in the console ...<br />I waited a long time, maybe 20 min, then, since the router was not rebooting by itself and the display not changing, I unplugged/plugged the power cord.<br />And the disaster appeared !<br />At reboot ... red solid led. No internet connection. Nothing working.<br />I have searched the wiki, and found this version (A0 A1) is now considered as a WZR-HP-G300NH2 (I think it wasn&#039;t until early last week).<br />Damn it !<br />I&#039;ve tried to apply the failed upgrade procedure (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr-hp-g300h#failed.upgrade.solid.red.diag.light.on.newer.versions">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr … r.versions</a>) by uploading&nbsp; buffalo factory image that has the file extension &#039;enc&#039;, without success. TFTP transfers is working, but then, nothing.<br />I&#039;ve tried with user-friendly image, with and without adding &quot;.enc&quot;&nbsp; to the filename too. I&#039;ve tried with various files, squashfs, jffs, tftp, even with the latest DD-WRT.bin firmware, but nothing happens ...<br />The red led stays solid.<br />I can&#039;t access in telnet/SSH/web.<br />It&#039;s just now as useful as a paperweight.<br />Is it the U-boot locked preventing me to write a new firmware ? If yes, what&#039;s the solution ?<br />Have I a last chance to save it ? How ?<br />Or do I have to change it ? <br />In this case, what would be the best choice ? Find another router (different brand/model) ? Buy a 2nd hand G300NH ? Buy a new G300NH2 ?</p><br /><br /><br /><p>EDIT&nbsp; (2014-08-01) : </p><p>Finally soldered a serial USB to TTL converter and played a little ...</p><p>I&#039;ve tried to force to accept any firmware by entering the magic command:</p><p>ar7100&gt; setenv accept_open_rt_fmt 1<br />ar7100&gt; saveenv<br />Saving Environment to Flash...<br />Protect off BE040000 ...
