					<p>Hello All,</p><p>I am using SOM9331 and ported Chaos Calmer 15.05 the module is working fine, I have installed all the required packages for the USB storage. I have also installed VSFTPD for accessing the files from USB drive. The problem is when we connect the USB device, after some times the device is disconnecting automatically and connecting again and each time device number is changing. We have written a script for creating the directory and mounting the USB drive based on the no of partition and an unmount script for deleting the directories and restarting the VSFTPD. We have tried with both VFAT and EXT file system and the behavior is same. </p><p>For testing we have disabled the VSFTPD and the scripts for mounting and unmounting, but still the USB device is disconnecting and connecting back again automatically.</p><p>In some of the post (Not in openwrt) they told it may be issue with the power, i have checked the power and supply is capable of providing the power required by the USB drive and SOM9331 module.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[ 2176.760000] usb 1-1: USB disconnect, device number 25

					<p>Some devices act like this.<br />For example, yota LTE modem first present itself as usb cdrom, after 2 seconds disconnects itself from usb and reconnects as usb network adapter.<br />Usb device has its own firmware which control how it acts on usb bus.<br />Anyway I see no problem if all you need is usb storage. /dev/sda? are always the same.<br />Using blkid is even better because it will work even if it connects as /dev/sdb</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bolvan</strong> on 28 Mar 2016, 10:07)</p>

					<p>Thanks Bolvan,</p><p>If this happens once then it is fine but then the module is in ideal the USB device keeps on disconnecting and connecting again.</p><p>As we are using over own script for restarting the VSFTPD and removing the directory created during mounting the USB drive. If the issue exists then our script will restart VSFTPD and the FTP client gets disconnected from the FTP server.</p><p>I am suspecting that when any data is getting copied to the USB drive from ftp client and if the USB drive disconnects then the data transfer won&#039;t happen and its a big issue for us.</p><p>The reason we are restarting VSFTPD is, once the client is connected to the ftp server and access the partition then removing the USB drive and plugging again will change the device from SDA to SDB as the FTP server is still holding the SDA device.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Sreekanth</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sreekanth.a</strong> on 28 Mar 2016, 10:37)</p>

					<p>Have you tested the same scenario on PC ?<br />USB ports on router can be not too good.<br />For example, If I connect usb hub to d-link DIR-825, all is fine until a device is removed or plugged in. All hub dies and reconnects. If extroot it means failure.<br />Random disconnects while transferring files is most likely hardware problem that makes usage impossible</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bolvan</strong> on 28 Mar 2016, 14:32)</p>

					<p>Solved!!</p><p>The USB connector was soldered on a general purpose board, I added a capacitor across the supply and ground of the USB drive and the issue is solved.</p><p>I am not sure reason behind the issue as TL-MR3420 works fine.</p>									</div>
