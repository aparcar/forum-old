					<p>Hello, </p><p>I am looking for a consultant to assist with a demo project.&nbsp; My goal is setup my 2 OM2P access points to log certain network traffic and be able to access those logs remotely. The OM2P&#039;s also need to mesh while they are monitor mode (I hope this is possible). I am a little overwhelmed with all the steps involved and would love some help getting everything setup.<br />I am willing to pay for someone to guide me through the details of the process so I don&#039;t go entirely insane.&nbsp; </p><br /><p>Here are the steps involved (I think):</p><p>- Install OpenWRT and Batman on the OM2P </p><p>- Put the OM2P in monitor mode</p><p>- Setup a kismet drone, tcpdump, tshark or something else to log certain network traffic on an ongoing basis.</p><p>- Ensure the OM2P&#039;s will mesh while all this is going on.</p><p>- Access the logs remotely so I can copy the logs to a central location and delete old logs.</p><br /><p>Please PM with a quote or clarifying questions if you are interested. I am decently tech savvy so I should catch on quick but I am .NET programmer so this is a new world for me.&nbsp; Also if you want to post any free advice on this thread I would be grateful.&nbsp; </p><p>Thanks,<br />Mike</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have been setting up and managing batman-adv networks since 2010, what you&#039;re trying to achieve is a fairly straight forward setup.</p><p>On point 3. Do you know what exactly you want to monitor and which of the three options you mentioned are best suited for this? This requirement is too vague to help out with.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, </p><p>Thanks for the response.&nbsp; I am monitoring probe requests from unassociated clients on a specific channel.&nbsp; Basically I want time, MAC and RSSI of each request.&nbsp; I also want the time, MAC and RSSI of client traffic associated with a specific AP that I specify.&nbsp; I don&#039;t need any other packet info.&nbsp; Basically I am building a time series of associated and unassociated clients.&nbsp; </p><p>I have done this using Airodump-ng on my laptop but it captures far more info than I need and I would like to keep the log files small.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t tried Tshark or tcpdump but I am assuming I specify exactly what I want.&nbsp; Worst case I will postprocess the files to throw out the extra data but I figured there was a more elegant way.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Mike</p>									</div>
