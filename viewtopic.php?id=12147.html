					<p>I&#039;m running OpenWRT 0.9 on my wrt54g3g-st which has a pcmcia slot for 3g cards. I&#039;ve made several changes to the kernel, scripts and WebifÂ², and I have nice 3g router setup going on.</p><br /><p>I can set up two wan interfaces independently already, I &#039;created&#039; another interface called wwan just for the 3g internet. Right now, I can manually toggle between the two, by using &quot;ifup wan&quot; or &quot;ifup wwan&quot; etc. I just need some advice on how to toggle them automatically.</p><p>I was thinking that I would create a hotplug script that starts a daemon when the wan interface goes up, but i&#039;m not sure how i would have the bash script determine when the interface goes down. Any ideas would help me out a lot.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>oldschoolinux38</strong> on 19 Aug 2007, 04:39)</p>

					<p>Is that script written for whiterussian? I don&#039;t see any nvram variables.</p><p>I haven&#039;t migrated to kamikaze yet because of the broadcom wireless support. I know that I could use the 2.4 kernel with kamikaze, but frankly I don&#039;t see the point because there currently seems to be more documentation on whiterussian and I don&#039;t want to have to jump through all the hoops of getting X-wrt on kamikaze.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, thats a lot easier to understand with out all the irrelevant ntpclient script. I didn&#039;t realize that that was just an example at first.. haha.</p><p>Well thats pretty much exactly what I was thinking, have hotplug run a watchdog script on ifup that monitors the physical connection to the net (via ping probably) and have that switch interfaces when it fails.</p><p>Do you think thats the most reliable way of doing this? I was thinking that there has to be another way to determine if the wan interface goes down.</p>									</div>
