					<p>Hi, I am willing dnsmasq to resolv any host in a given domain to an specific LAN address. OpenWRT&#039;s dnsmasq is the only dns server on ny LAN.</p><p>I&#039;ve read through dnsmasq documentation and confirmed that this can be done with the --address option. Therefore I added &#039;address=/mydomain.org/mydomain/192.168.1.X&#039; to /etc/dnsmasq.conf file on my OpenWRT but it keeps on adding ths address option as a server option under UCI&#039;s dnsmasq as &#039;list server &#039;/mydomain.org/mydomain/192.168.1.x&#039;.</p><p>What I am doing wrong? How can I acomplish this?</p><p>Thanks a lot!</p>									</div>

					<p>I would suggest putting it directly into /etc/config/dhcp like e.g.;<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>list address    &#039;/mycompany.local/1.2.3.4&#039;
list address    &#039;/mydomain.org/mydomain/192.168.1.5&#039;</code></pre></div><p>But I&#039;ve just tested putting it in /etc/dnsmasq.conf and it did work. Are you using this exact format?;<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>address=/testdomain.org/mydomain/192.168.1.6</code></pre></div><p>You can check the current configuration by;<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cat /tmp/etc/dnsmasq.conf | grep address
cat /etc/dnsmasq.conf | grep address</code></pre></div>									</div>

					<p>OK, working with uci solved the configuration issue (modifying dnsmasq.conf does NOT work for &#039;address=&#039;), I also had problems whit a DHCP lease but now is finally working!</p><p>Thanks gleten!</p>									</div>
