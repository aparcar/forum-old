					<p>You should be able to determine GND by measuring for a 0 Ohms resistance to one of the plenty available GND sources (like SW4 at the white triangle). Most likely Rx and Tx pins are right next to GND. If you find a spot on the pcb that says something like 3V3, you can measure the resistance of your serial pins against that point (same here, test for 0 Ohms).<br />You can then go with trial and error for Tx and Rx, there are just 2 possible options.</p>									</div>

					<p>Another way to find the supply and ground is to identify the ram chip part number and look up the data sheet.<br />Use an ohm meter to check continuity from rs232 header to these supply and<br />ground pins.<br />Then you have only two pins to work with. With your level shifter try the remaining pins one way, if they dont work reverse as noted above and try again.<br />~john</p>									</div>
