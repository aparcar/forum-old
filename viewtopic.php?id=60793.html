					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I have here several EnGenius ENS202EXT access points and I want to make OpenWrt work on it.<br />I already collect some information and put it on a page for the table of hardware but still lot to do.</p><p>What I make work so far is an image that can boot linux, controlling the leds, can read the (reset) button, and 1 working ethernet port.<br />The second ethernet port doesn&#039;t work on the moment but have maybe to do with set the right settings in the ethernet switch of the AR9341.<br />Wifi I can&#039;t test on the moment with this image.</p><p>But now I&#039;m a little bit stuck what to do next.<br />Is it a good idea to submit already (somewhere) the patches I made for the linux kernel? if yes, where / how?<br />I already play around with the OpenWrt build scripts / target configurations and manage to create a test image for the ENS202EXT but this is far from good.<br />Now I&#039;m a bit lost where to start to get the scripts / configurations right. What is the best way to follow to support this device that I easy can create an image including LuCi, etc?</p>									</div>

					<p>Google ens202ext openwrt and you find a couple of hits hinting that an ens202ext openwrt image was already made and commercially used awhile back. One site offered for free but crippled ware, I think. It claims to be able to flash directly from the stock firmware GUI and back to stock firmware via GUI, not requiring telnet or console.</p>									</div>

					<p>I just bought a couple of these. I have spent a total of about half an hour with it, but it appears that they are already running a modified version of OpenWRT. It seems to be using a &quot;skinned&quot; and customized version of LUCI, but there does not seem to be a way to enable ssh. There is a &quot;CLI&quot; that is accessible via Telnet, but it&#039;s a specialized shell that allows only the options enabled in the web interface.</p><p>The big clue that it&#039;s a modified OpenWRT underneath, however, is provided by using the firmware upgrade command &quot;fwgrade&quot; in the CLI, which responds:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Recognized URL format:&nbsp; string&nbsp; &nbsp; EX: <a href="http://192.168.1.101:8080/openwrt-senao-ens202ext-squashfs(140811).bin">http://192.168.1.101:8080/openwrt-senao â€¦ 40811).bin</a></p></blockquote></div><p>What remains to be seen is how to flash &quot;normal&quot; OpenWRT onto them.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>After some months I picked up again to port OpenWRT for the ENS202EXT.<br />Currently I have a working version here. The only thing where I&#039;m struggling with is the way OpenWRT building environment build the files (the factory upgrade and the sysupgrade)<br />I have basically 2 choices in the /target/linux/ar71xx/image/Makefile<br />- $(eval $(call SingleProfile,Senao,squashfs-only,ENS202EXT, ....<br />- $(eval $(call SingleProfile,EnGenius,64k,ENS202EXT, ....</p><p>The first choice give me a good factory upgrade image but a not working sysupgrade image. Because when I flash the sysupgrade image the kernel and rootfs have a 64KB offset in the flash (the sysupgrade file header is flashed too to the flash) and the rootfs can&#039;t be find in the flash because it have to be flashed into the next mtd part and not 64KB aligned after the kernel what if i&#039;m right the /scripts/combined-image.sh is responsible for.</p><p>The second choice give me a good sysupgrade image but a not working factory upgrade image. This is because the factory image that is produced by the Makefile with the EnGenius profile isn&#039;t the same format for the ENS202EXT.</p><p>I have a solution and created my own profile and combined from the Senao and the EnGenius profile the scripts together to create a working factory upgrade and a sysupgrade image. But if possible I don&#039;t want to add a new profile type to the Makefile if it isn&#039;t really necessary. Does anybody have any idea for it what is the right way to do?</p><p>For the rest I really like to share my patches with everybody who are interested in it but have to find out what is the right way to follow without making a mess <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> And because that I started with creating the patches for OpenWRT 15.05 maybe it is better to create them first for the OpenWRT Designated Driver.</p>									</div>

					<p>The last few time I tried the openwrt firmware for engenius eap300, it work but after a sysupgrade, it completely bricked the device. Recently, I downloaded the snapshot firmware and still it is the same. Will this happen to the ens202ext too as what you explained? I have enough bricked engenius devices, until someone post instruction how to de-brick it : Till date, the eap300 has sort became a brain dead project with no support. : (</p><p><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/18016">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/18016</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your information Maddymal. It shine some light on why the Senao profile for creating files doesn&#039;t work for me. I can if you want create a factory and a sysupgrade file the same way I now do for testing my ens202ext for your eap300. Or if you can build OpenWRT yourself I can send you a patch.</p><p>I believe the eap300 and the ens202ext are on the software side mostly identical and I think de-brick it would be then the same.<br />I can de-brick my ens202ext by connect a serial terminal to it and power up the device and press a key when it tell that it will stop the autoboot.<br />Then I give the following commands:<br /></p><ul><li><p>setenv rootfs_checksum</p></li><li><p>saveenv</p></li><li><p>reset</p></li></ul><p>Then the bootloader will fail the rootfs_chechsum check and will start it&#039;s failsafe image. This failsafe image will start a simple webserver that accept the firmware files from EnGenius and the openwrt-factory image.</p><p>If I&#039;m right there is a second method to de-brick the device and that is power on the device while the reset button is pressed and hold. The bootloader then try to download from a TFTP server with IP 192.168.1.101 the file &#039;vmlinux-art-ramdisk&#039;. I don&#039;t have this file but my feeling tell me that it can be the binary dump of the failsafe MTD partition to make the device boot.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Gerard, thanks! After reading your message, I decided to dig out out the bricked eap300s and give it another try. I do not have a serial cable and I read somewhere you need a jtag and serial cable to work. I google and tried to purchase one and realized there are tons of these devices and I have no idea what should I be getting and the decent ones cost 50 bucks and above!</p><p>I decided to check out easywrt again because you mentioned vmlinux-art-ramdisk and I once read about it there - <a href="https://www.easywrt.com/downloads">https://www.easywrt.com/downloads</a> - What is a ramdisk?</p><p>I finally decide to try out their method of de-bricking above your suggested solution because:</p><p>- I do not know whether I will have the right tools after paying 50 bucks and having to open up the devices which i dread doing so, and those commands you mentioned seems a bit challenging for me, like where, when and how do i enter those commands? </p><p>I downloaded the vmlinux-art-ramdisk from easywrt and followed the instruction in the &quot;what is a ramdisk?&quot; and my eap300 shot back to life! I reluctantly paid 15 bucks (Damn! Used to be only 7 bucks!) to receive an activation code which I pasted it when prompted, and I finally got into the openwrt GUI. I flashed easywrt eap300 openwrt firmware and also the engenius firmware and both works! Finally, it came back to life.</p><p>I tried to use the activation code on the other bricked eap300 but it did not work. The code seems to work on specific MAC address. Heck, I spent another 15 bucks for another activation code for the other eap300 and it similarly work like the earlier one.</p><p>In summary, I spent 30 bucks to revive both eap300, compared to 50 bucks which I have the least slightest clue of knowing how to do so and unscrewing the device. I comfort myself it was worth it. This will be the last time I will be tempted to try a firmware from the openwrt download section. </p><p>Nevertheless, thank you Gerard for your nice gesture and suggestions.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>maddymal</strong> on 15 Mar 2016, 23:15)</p>
