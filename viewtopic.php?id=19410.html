					<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>I just upgraded my Linksys WRT 54G to Kamikaze 7.06 , I have done this a couple times before, but...I guess I must have screwed up royally this time.</p><p>I was trying to configure my IP addressing scheme onto the router and from what I can figure, I have the lan and wan ports set for dhcp. This is preventing me from connecting to 192.168.1.1, default IP address.</p><p>I tried setting up a dhcp server on my desktop to give the router an IP address off of my desktop...I was able<br />to see that it had indeed leased an address to the router, so...that part works.</p><p>I was able to connect to it once after that, but I don&#039;t have the slightest clue as to how I did it.</p><p>Here is my current setup:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ISP<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ISP-Router ( ISP-R )<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kamikazee 7.06 router ( K-router )<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\<br />Desktop&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Laptop </p><p>I am trying to figure out a way out of this pickle and I figured it was time to ask for help. Thanks in advance.</p><p>Matt</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>matt.entropy@gmail.com</strong> on 16 Mar 2009, 23:32)</p>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>You need to understand what is happening between the DHCP server and the CLIENT (your router).</p><p>My suggestion is to:<br />1.- use tcpdump (wireshark or whatever) in the DHCP server. You should see the bootp request and, if everything goes fine, the answer from the server.<br />2.- check the IP address allocated to the DHCP client (your router). You might use again the capture above or the logs of the DHCP server. In your case, I will also wire the ethernet of the router to a fixed IP address. In this manner, you will always know the allocated IP.<br />3.- Try to communicate ! (ping ?)<br />4.- Try to connect.</p><p>If the IP address was properly allocated (1 and 2) and you cannot communicate (3 or 4) you should have a problem with the fw in the router (iptables). Check it.</p><p>Regards.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry it took so long...yet again...to return here.<br />I am not sure if there was a misunderstanding or what the deal was...Let me start from square one.</p><p>Steps taken to set up/configure the kamikaze router:</p><p>1) Updated firmware from White Russian 0.9 to Kamikaze 7.06 </p><p>2) Installed the web-if, so that things could be configured through the browser.</p><p>3) Set the root password</p><p>4) Configured WLAN for DHCP, obtain IP address from the network server.</p><p>5) Set the LAN ip address of routher to 192.168.2.2</p><p>5) Configured LAN to allocate ip addresses from the 192.168.2.10 - 192.168.2.20</p><p>6) Configured Wireless to allocate ip addresses from 192.168.2.20 - 192.168.2.40</p><p>After applying these changes to the router....things went south. I lost the connection between my PC and my router...timed out in the browser.</p><p>From this point on....the trouble-shooting began...</p><p>--I was able to connect once, after doing the following--</p><p>Because I knew that the interfaces were using the DHCP, why couldn&#039;t I set up a dhcp server on my PC? Tried that. I did not get any kind of indication whether or not the router had been given an IP address or not, so I manually plugged in the MAC address of the router and setup a static lease entry. </p><p>The cabling was kinda strange, but here is how it went...</p><p>I had a cable running from my pc, into the Internet port on the Linksys 54G wireless router. A second cable running into a simple linksys switch, which then has a cable running to my external router of the network.</p><p> I also have a laptop here, for trying to diagnose the problem here. ( Note: firewall is turned off on both computers )</p><p> I have installed several programs to try to resolve this issue.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; -- dhcp server on PC, as indicated above.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; -- Wireshark, on both computers<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; -- Nmap, on both computers<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; -- IP scanner, on both computers</p><p>SO.....after trying to do everything mentioned above, here is where I am at:</p><p> -- Unable to ping the router<br /> -- Tried wireshark and a few other network analyzing tools<br /> -- Tried doing a &quot;Hard reset&quot;<br /> -- From a little research, from the LED light activity I am getting, it appears to be a corrupt firmware, bootloader is intact.</p><p>Any ideas or solutions to this frustrating and challenging problem is always appreciated! Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>
