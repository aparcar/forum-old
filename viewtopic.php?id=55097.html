					<p>To keep it short and simple. I have all wired gigabit network. All pc&#039;s, NAS are hard wired.<br />Router: wrt1900ac, running &quot;OpenWrt Chaos Calmer r43853 &quot;</p><p>radio0:Wifi N only, 40MHZ, <br />radio1: Wifi AC only, 80MHZ, channel 48 (complete free, no other routers around)</p><p>With stock linksys FW my wifi AC speeds are pretty good . I&#039;m testing with my phone. I can hit 22 MB/sec for file transfer from my NAS</p><p>With openwrt my wifi AC speeds are less than quarter of the oem. I get about 4.8MB/sec.</p><p>Am i doing something wrong? Could someone please help me with some suggestion or some key config i might have forgotten.<br />Even though the wifi client is connected at over 400Mbps, this is what i see under the wifi radio on the router, it shows bitrate to be 6Mbit for some reason, even though my file transfers seem to be happening at 55mbits:</p><p><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4883446/status.JPG">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4883446/status.JPG</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>alirz</strong> on 13 Jan 2015, 03:44)</p>
