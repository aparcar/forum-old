					<p>Hey People,</p><p>i gave up achieving a Multi-SSID network, where one is routed through a permanent VPN connection (OpenWRT as OpenVPN client) and the other through the &quot;normal&quot; DSL connection. I tried hours and hours of configuration following every guide i found. At the end it seemed as if either it would involve policy routing or setting up MultiWan connections, both of which where over my skills to set up. (original question here: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=53704">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=53704</a></p><p>To make things easier, i will just use two different AP&#039;s, i ordered a Archer C5 which will be do the normal internet AP and want to configure the 1043ND (v1) as a dedicated AP for VPN access. But even that seems to be over my head right now, i am kind of lost with the settings for firewall interzone forwarding, VLAN setup, interface bridging etc.</p><p>I guess the most appropriate guide for what i want to do is the DumbAP HowTo, with just enabling OpenVPN, since the 1043nd will not handle the (internet) connection itself. I&#039;d like the 1043ND to</p><p>- use the 1043&#039;s WAN port to connect to my switch which is connected to the archer<br />- let the Archer be the DHCP authority and give out the local IP to the 1043ND<br />- establish the VPN tunnel on the 1043ND and route all traffic of devices connected to the LAN Ports OR the Wifi Interface through tun0 / VPN</p><p>does anyone know of a howto for that purpose, maybe specific to the 1043nd to include VLAN settings as well?</p><p>thanks,<br />e.</p>									</div>
