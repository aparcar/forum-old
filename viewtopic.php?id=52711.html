					<p>Hi all,<br />I&#039;m a little tired as I&#039;ve been working at this for hours but I can&#039;t seem to get this working. Here&#039;s what I have:<br /></p><ul><li><p><a href="http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00634PLTW/">TP-LINK TL-MR3020</a></p></li><li><p><a href="http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BJOZNV2/">USB to Ethernet adapter</a></p></li></ul><p>Here&#039;s what I&#039;ve been trying to do with this little guy:<br />The ethernet on the router is eth0 and my USB adapter is eth1. I&#039;m trying to provide Internet access to a device connected to eth1. The issue is that if I bridge eth0 and eth1, both the router on eth0 and the device behind the router on eth1 get their own unique IP addresses from my main router. I don&#039;t want eth0 to get an IP, but I do want eth1 to get one. Basically, the router shouldn&#039;t interfere. The two either ports should act as a simple pass-through or cable joiner if you will.</p><p>Any input would be appreciated.</p>									</div>
