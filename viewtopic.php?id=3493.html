					<p>I have 2 public ip addresses that terminate on my DSL modem. They aren&#039;t on the same subnet, but they do share the same first 2 octets. Currently, I have a linux box with a single NIC that has a one ip address assigned to eth1 and a second ip address assigned to the virtual adapter eth1:0.</p><p>What I&#039;d like to do is have the WRT54G take over that role (and several others). Is this possible?</p><p>Further, in the current setup, I use the 2 different ip addresses to host 2 different websites. How would I accomplish the same thing if I put the WRT54G at the edge of the network instead of the linux box?</p><p>...Kevin (almost ready to make the leap)</p>									</div>

					<p>thanks for that confirmation mbm. It really seems like this OpenWrt project has the bases covered. Thanks to you and the others for the great work in putting it out there. And in a no-strings-attached manner.</p><p>...Kevin</p>									</div>
