					<p>I too would like to remove openWRT and get my router back. DD-WRT is just a much better solution for me. I have never been able to get a webgui from openWRT and have been fighting for a few days now trying to load original firmware back on. I have 7.09 loaded and have telnet access. Figured out how to program LAN/WAN/WIRELESS settings. Problem is Tftp&#039;s all fail with time outs. No WEBGUI. I have followed all the threads on this, and just can&#039;t seem to get it removed. And this BIN loading problem is confusing to me also. Dont understand how to strip the header. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>									</div>
