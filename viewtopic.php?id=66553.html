					<p>Hello,</p><p>This is my 1st post and I hope I post it in the correct forum.<br />I would be happy to know if there&#039;s Open Wrt support for the Tp-link TL-ER604W Router.<br />I have few units and they tend to freeze every few weeks. I used latest beta firmware that was sent to me by Tp-Link themseves, But it&#039;s still doing that &quot;thang&quot;</p><p>Thank you !</p>									</div>

					<p>I did not see it on the list; wiki[dot]openwrt[dot]org/toh/start (sorry, forum won&#039;t let me post links). </p><p>I too have this router and would like to put openwrt on it. I was planning on upgrading my current router to this one, but didn&#039;t realize that it does not support openvpn until after purchasing it.</p><p>Does anyone know if there are any plans to develop a firmware version for this model? I am willing to use mine for testing if interested.</p>									</div>
