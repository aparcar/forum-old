					<p>Follow-up, with compat-wireless 2009-02-19 and later...

					<p>Just curious if both the madwifi and ath9k drive can run at the same time? Probably a stupid question, but I&#039;m looking at trying it with 2 cards in the RouterStation, one atheros G card and one atheros N card. Would a conflict arise in hostapd if I put setting in for N? Thanks for any and all replies.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>I&#039;m planning to move from oleg&#039;s firmware to openwrt on a asus wl500gP v1. I also want to use a different wireless adapter wich supports N. Preferably with one antenna. I found out that TL-WN722n usb adapter is atheos based, has antenna connector, supports N and also it is a high gain one. It has atheros ar5008x chip (looks like it is the first atheros usb model).</p><p>Do you guys think that it is gong to work openwrt running on a wl500gp v1?</p><p> dp79</p>									</div>

					<p>just wanted to share my experience that a stable client mode (STA) on a RouterStation (ar7161) platform using R54n wireless (ar9220) miniPCI<br />with OpenWrt trunk r18058 (ath9k etc. 2.6.30.8) I could only achieve by first bringing the card up as an AP, to bring hostapd and the card down, and then to initialise it as STA using wpa_supplicant.<br />Straight into STA mode produces good pings towards the AP and back (~2 ms) but erratic behaviour when pinged from the AP and back (100ms) although with a strong signal and no noise.<br /> Loads of disconnects (Reason: 3).&nbsp; After a while the system may crash.<br />Doing the STA with wpa_supplicant after briefly having brought it up before as an AP with hostapd results in rock stable performance. <br />There must be some setting(s) done in AP mode to set the hardware and drivers up that are also necessary for STA mode but have been forgotten.</p>									</div>
