					<p>I have a v2 of TL-WA730RE that basically gathered dust. It keeps dropping its repeater function, even after having been paired with another TP-Link router. Openwrt still has not fully supported it (only v1 is officially supported), but after outweighing the risk vs gain, I flashed mine and confirmed that it is possible to upload TL-WR740N v4 version of Openwrt on it. See here: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=42236&amp;p=2">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php â€¦ 36&amp;p=2</a></p><p>Still need to test whether it is more stable on Openwrt, just the same, or even worse.</p>									</div>

					<p>after running this as AP for couple of months, I can testify that it works solid as AP, but wireless repeater function still appears to be broken.. it works for up to a few hours then disappears..</p>									</div>
