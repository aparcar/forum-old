					<p>Hello!</p><p>I created some simple shell scripts that I also created cgi links for. These links can be called without logging into the web ui, and they word great. However, I have not managed to suppress the output of these scripts. Simply redirecting output channel and calling a script like this does not work:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>myscript.sh 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;/dev/null</code></pre></div><p>Still, the browser tries to download the output and open it in a separate editor, as soon as I call the link to execute the scripts. How can I change this? </p><p>If the output can&#039;t be suppressed, it would be sufficient to turn it into a regular HTML page, so the browser does not try to start to download the output, but to make the browser display the result directly in its own window.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>_w_</strong> on 1 Jan 2016, 13:28)</p>

					<p>I hope someone else will chime in with a better answer but in case no one does or you just need to be nudged in the direction...</p><p>My memory on that is pretty vague but I&#039;ve done something similar many a years back as far as I can remember. Not with OpenWrt tho and it was a perl script, but FWIW I think I&#039;ve found a way to check the environment when the script was called and determine wherever it was called from the console or by a web-server and modify the script&#039;s output accordingly. So, among other things, for the web-based call I believe I ended up forming the proper HTTP reply around the script output so that browser could interpret it as a regular HTML page.</p><p>Good luck!</p>									</div>

					<p>As for returning a HTML page that is interpreted as such by browsers, stangri is spot on: You need to send the proper HTTP headers before sending the actual content, in your case at least a &quot;Content-type&quot; header, and a blank line to separate the header from the content. See the example at <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/http.httpd#cgi">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/http.httpd#cgi</a></p><p>As for the other problem, I will happily stand corrected by a more knowledgeable person than I am, but I believe it&#039;s not enough to just call the shell script redirecting the output to /dev/null, but actually the single commands in there have to have their output redirected.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 1 Jan 2016, 18:57)</p>

					<p>Thanks, that really does help - well, at least a little bit:</p><p>I tried this in my script:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>if [ &quot;$DOCUMENT_ROOT&quot; = &quot;/www&quot; ];  
then
    echo &quot;&lt;HTML&gt;  &lt;HEAD&gt;  &lt;TITLE&gt;Output&lt;/TITLE&gt;  &lt;/HEAD&gt; &lt;body&gt;&quot;
fi

some_shell_commands

if [ &quot;$DOCUMENT_ROOT&quot; = &quot;/www&quot; ];
then
        echo  &quot;&lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;&quot;
fi</code></pre></div><p>The &quot;if&quot; cases are executed, when I call the script via browser and they are not executed, when I call the script via command line. So far, so well. But the server somehow turns the output into a simple text file: the browser starts to download the file &quot;myscript.sh.txt&quot; as soon as I call the cgi. This textfile is a the complete HTML page, though:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>&lt;HTML&gt;&nbsp; &lt;HEAD&gt;&nbsp; &lt;TITLE&gt;Output&lt;/TITLE&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/HEAD&gt; &lt;body&gt;<br />results of shell commands<br />&lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;</p></blockquote></div><p>The problem seems to be the server, that turns the output into a text file. The server also deals differently with the cgi, depending on how the script is called:</p><p>- if I log in the web ui and call the commands, I see the output inside the browser<br />- if I call the external links (https://serveradress/cgi-bin/luci/command/cfgxxxxxx) the browser is offered a text file that contains the results</p><p>So, I guess what&#039;s needed is a method to keep the server from putting the script&#039;s output into a text file.</p>									</div>

					<p>metai: sorry for the cross over! It took me a few minutes longer to write my reply.</p><p>I took a look at the howto you mentioned and I replaced the first echo statement with</p><p>echo &quot;Content-type: text/html&quot;<br />echo &quot;&quot;</p><p>Still, the browser is offered a text file to download.</p><p>Is it possible we are talking about two different types of cgi? I was referring to the custom commands that you can define in the web ui. They can be made executable without having to login first. </p><p>If the desired effect is not possible to achieve using this kind of cgi, I guess I have to write real cgi scripts.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>_w_</strong> on 1 Jan 2016, 20:38)</p>
