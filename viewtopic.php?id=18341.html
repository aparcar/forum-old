					<p>Hi,<br />I&#039;m currently using openwrt on my Asus 500gp and it works great. I&#039;ve just got myself a MacBook Pro with a 802.11n and my gf also has a macbook with 802.11n. We&#039;re both using iTunes for playing music and only have one set of speakers. The Apple&#039;s Airport Express has the very nice feature of streaming audio from iTunes via wifi. I would like to buy the AE for this feature + for the 802.11n bandwidth.</p><p>I still want to keep&nbsp; my openwrt box cos I&#039;m using a lot the ssh access when I&#039;m not at home.</p><p>my current set up is the following:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>CABLE MODEM ------- (public IP via DHCP) OPENWRT (192.168.2.1)--------- 192.168.2.0/24 WLAN</p></blockquote></div><p>What network configuration would I have if I add the AE which is another router. Something like this ?</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>CABLE MODEM ------- (public IP via DHCP) OPENWRT (192.168.2.1)---------&nbsp; (192.168.2.2) AirportExpress 192.168.1.0/24 WLAN</p></blockquote></div><p>The problem with this config is that I will lose all the OpenWRT services (dhcp, QoS, samba HD,..) on my LAN since the latter will be managed by the Airport Express.</p><p>So what do you advice ?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Tex</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Tex-Twil</strong> on 13 Jan 2009, 10:50)</p>

So my config is as follows</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>CABLE MODEM ------- (public IP via DHCP) OPENWRT (192.168.2.1)---------&nbsp; (192.168.2.2) AirportExpress&nbsp; bridged 192.168.2.0/24 WLAN</p></blockquote></div><p>So my wlan is on the same lan as the openwrt and I can use all the services of openwrt <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>
