					<p>This is for those who like to build their own images and may have had problems with wifi working at all. Some have been getting the blank drop downs depending on the hardware they are on. Well, in &quot;make menuconfig&quot; you now have to select the wifi firmware manually after selecting the image you want to compile. The selection is under &quot;Firmware&quot;, so just choose the firmware appropriate to your hardware. Personally, I don&#039;t like it as it adds another layer of complexity and something else you have to remember to do if starting with a new .config. Apparently, someone with OCD didn&#039;t like more than one firmware showing up in the /lib/firmware/mwlwifi directory, and had to change it. No worries though, as I contacted the developer who made the commit change and this person was very helpful in directing me on what to do to fix the issue. Still it would have been nice to have the instructions on how to build wifi after the change was made....... They could have put it in the commit change description or something, or maybe I just missed it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Side Rant against ISP&#039;s.... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>People here in the USA on Comcast, Charter, or at&amp;t; you may consider subscribing to a vpn service. Since net neutrality rules have died, and they don&#039;t realistically look like they are coming back unless you live in a state which has implemented its own rules, your speeds, depending on where you go on the web are at risk. Comcast, for example, is chomping at the bit to start paid prioritization for companies who want to pay so they can have faster speeds to Comcast&#039;s customers. Once Comcast commits, other ISP&#039;s are sure to fall in line. My recommendation will be to subscribe in a VPN service which will mask most of what you and your family are doing on-line. Besides the Net Neutrality issue, there&#039;s also a more important issue of Privacy. ISP&#039;s are collecting all kinds of information about you and your family and are selling that data to 3rd parties who &#039;promise&#039; to keep it safe. Really, the only solution to this growing issue is a B2B VPN or in this case a R2C VPN. Currently, I just encrypt all dns traffic, which makes putting the big picture together more difficult for my ISP, but at some point it isn&#039;t going to be good enough. So, I highly recommend people start looking at some of these encryption technologies to help ensure privacy and that you are going to get your data equally across the net. </p><p>Those are my 2¢ on the subject <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>cheers --</p>									</div>
