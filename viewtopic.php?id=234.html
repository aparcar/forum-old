					<p>I wanted to use my router as a transparent bridging firewall, which is kind of weird so nobody seems to have done it.&nbsp; Bridging works in the OpenWRT kernel, and firewalling works, but bridged packets are invisible to ipchains.&nbsp; It turns out that to do this with kernel 2.4.20 you need a patch called bridge-nf which I dug out of the <a href="http://ebtables.sourceforge.net/">ebtables</a> web site (ebtables is what bridge-nf evolved into).</p><p>The patch needed a little work before it would apply cleanly, since the OpenWRT kernel has already been patched so many times.&nbsp; Here is a version that works for me.&nbsp; I applied it by doing the following to my already-once-used buildroot tree:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cd build_mipsel/linux
bzcat ~/091-bridge-nf.bz2 | patch -p1
make zImage
cd ../.. (wd now: buildroot)
make</code></pre></div><p>This worked but is probably not the best way.&nbsp; It seems reasonable to hope that dropping this patch in sources/kernel-patches before doing a make would be sufficient, but I haven&#039;t tried this.</p><p>With this kernel, bridged packets will pass through the FORWARD iptable.&nbsp; You can use e.g. &quot;-i eth0&quot; to match packets that came in on physical interface eth0 (even though eth0 is part of br0).&nbsp; I am using this to bridge together vlan0 and vlan1 (both wired interfaces), which I can now use as an invisible firewall between the DSL modem and the rest of the network.&nbsp; (I&#039;m not doing this with NAT because I have more than one static IP on my end.)</p><p>Note that it is much more common to be bridging the inside-wired and inside-wireless interfaces, and if you apply this patch in this configuration you will probably have to adjust your FORWARD chain to avoid weird side effects.</p>									</div>

Of course its not 100% OSI compatible, but it has interesting possibilities, like transparent filters. Btw: bridging, which uses MAC addresses (ethernet), works on layer 2. Layer 3 handles routing (and uses ip addresses).</p>									</div>
