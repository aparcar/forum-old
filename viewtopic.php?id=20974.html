					<p>Has anyone had any luck getting a USB 3G modem working on a Ubiquiti RouterStation? I have most of it working now but get an error &quot;Cannot load PIN number&quot; .&nbsp; Could anyone tell me how to tell which tty port the usb modem is using, I could test some AT commands maybe? Obviously I am a novice at openwrt, I have managed to get two 5.8GHZ and one 2.4GHZ radios working and loaded X-wrt. Any help to get me started in the right direction would be greatly appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />The Option Icon 322 requires the HSO driver which will result in the device enumerating /dev/ttyHS0 and /dev/ttyHS1. The HSO driver comes packaged with an hso_connect.sh script that will connect the device, though it needs to be modified for the Quicksilver because Option apparently can&#039;t adhere to their own standards. The interface will be hso0 instead of ppp0.</p><br /><p>Which kernel are you on? Later kernels include the HSO driver, but if the device is enumerating /dev/ttyUSB0 I would think that you don&#039;t have the driver.</p><br /><p>PHARscape has a good entry on the AT&amp;T Quicksilver (Option Icon 322): <a href="http://www.pharscape.org/Quicksilver.html">http://www.pharscape.org/Quicksilver.html</a></p><br /><p>In my experience the Quicksilver is a shoddy device. It fails during the connection process more than it succeeds. It&#039;s a POS card and AT&amp;T is retarded for selling it so aggressively.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>aport</strong> on 10 Jul 2009, 20:09)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the information. I agree that the Option is a POS. I have just received a Pantech USB modem from Verizon, that I will be trying today. I think I will be leaning heavily toward VZ as they have promised me a pre release 4G card to test with in two weeks. I will be reading your links and trying your suggestions today. BTW my release version is&nbsp; 2.6.28.9&nbsp; .</p><p>Again thanks for your input.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, I&#039;ve put the Option 322 aside for now. I have gone on to the Pantech UM175 USB from Verizon.
