					<p>Hi Cherry, </p><p>At present I do not have access to the version of the Redboot source code that is running in the platform i am using.

					<p>Hi Cherry, </p><p>The machine id that is configured under Redboot is 290. This corresponds to Coyote platform in openwrt. I built the openwrt kernel for the Coyote platform and tried it. But, it still doesnt seem to work. </p><p>Also, would a separate zImage be generated for each platform (openwrt-&lt;platform&gt;-zImage) ? as i did not see a separate one for coyote. I presumed it would be part of openwrt-ixp4xx-zImage itself. Can you pls. confirm this for me?. </p><p>Thanx<br />Rajesh.M.V.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you have a Coyote board, then you&#039;ll have to select it in the kernel_menuconfig; the resulting openwrt-ixp4xx-zImage should then work; note that the current scripts won&#039;t generate an openwrt-coyote-zImage but that is not important. But make sure your HW is in fact a Coyote or clone, otherwise, it won&#039;t work.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Cherry, </p><p>Thanx for your response. </p><p>I did compile with Coyote previously too after i got the machine id configured under Redboot. Anyways, It worked fine this time with Coyote. Had some issues with the version of Redboot i was using.&nbsp; </p><p>But after bootup, the message &quot;eth0: MII read failed&quot; pops up continuously. </p><p>Can you pls. let me know your thoughts on this and how this could be corrected?.</p><p>Thanx<br />Raj</p>									</div>

					<p>Looks like the board may not be 100% compatible with Coyote; it may be using different PHYs. There may be other changes as well.</p><p>You should create a new thread for this board and provide details. This will require work so be prepared. You&#039;ll need to clearly document what you have with pictures as well as output from the device. Start with showing the serial output of the original firmware.</p>									</div>
