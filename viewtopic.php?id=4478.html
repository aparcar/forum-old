					<p>I looked around the forum and found 5 threads, only 1 was relevant to the v3 and it was from 6 months ago.<br />Is there support, partial or experimental for this unit? I noticed that it needs a hex inverter for the serial port<br />so I will be picking one up. If a developer wants the unit it could be pried out of my hands. It has a Marvel switch (88E6060), 64mbit (8MB) ram (IS42S16400A-7T) and a flash I could not find the specs for (MX 29LV160ABTC-90)</p><p>Egg</p>									</div>
