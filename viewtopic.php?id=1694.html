					<p>Hi all.</p><p>I was wondering if there is any way to authenticate wireless users on a WRT54G with WPA and do radius accounting. Is there a package that provides this functionality? I&#039;ve mannaged to get the WPA working with my radius server, but I don&#039;t see any accounting messages. I assume radius accounting is not implemented since where using the same nas binary from the linksys firmware.</p><p>I&#039;ve seen chillispot, but it seems that it requires an additional webserver for authentication.</p><p>I really want those accounting messages. I there a way? Any advice would be appreciated.</p><p>Thanks.<br />Avatar</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your reply.</p><p>I was acctually hoping not to use a web server at all, not even if its embedded in the wrt54g. I want to use 802.1x/Peap for authentication. So all I need is a nas that is capable of accounting.</p><p>Cheers<br />Avatar</p>									</div>

					<p>Ah yes ok. I think that nas is not accounting capable, but maybe writing a C program handling accounting information can do it ? In fact I don&#039;t think it is easy or efficient; but why not try.</p>									</div>

					<p>I wouldn&#039;t mind trying, but would I have to rewrite an implementation of the nas binary or is there a way that I could plugin to the nas binary to find out when new users authenticated,etc.</p><p>If I&#039;m going to write my own &quot;nas&quot;, what exactly does the &quot;nas&quot; tool do. Which standard would I follow (WPA2,802.1x) ? I&#039;m guessing that I&#039;d be able to handle coding the different encryption types (Tkip,Aes) in such a program, but not sure how to communicate with the Linksys wrt54g hardware. Any suggested reading?</p><p>Regards<br />Avatar</p>									</div>

					<p>By using <a href="http://chillispot.org/">chillispot</a> as a proxy for your nas RADIUS authentication, it will provide you with accounting for the wpa session. You do not have to run a captive portal at all, in fact chillispot proper does not currently allow for a captive portal under WPA - it assumes all users are subscribers - but it does do the DHCP and provide RADIUS accounting.. </p><p>It is also possible to provide <a href="http://coova.org/wiki/index.php/CoovaChilli/WithWPACaptivePortal">guest access using WPA and captive portal</a>, but this requires the <a href="http://coova.org/wiki/index.php/CoovaChilli">coova patched chillispot</a>. You can find the &#039;nas&#039; program and coova chilli working together in the <a href="http://coova.org/wiki/index.php/CoovaAP">CoovaAP</a> firmware..</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>david</strong> on 4 Oct 2006, 11:12)</p>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I also managed to get WPA2 enterprise to work with my radius server to do Authentication, but I searched everwhere to see if there is any firmware/plugin or something to get my NAS (WRT54GL) to send accounting messages to my radius server, but couldnÂ´t find a solution.<br />Anyone could solve this??<br />Any help would be greatly aprecciated.</p><p>TITO</p>									</div>
