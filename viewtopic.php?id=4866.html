According to <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=4856">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=4856</a> I have to edit /etc/init.d/S50dropbear too. What would happen if I did not get this correct? Would I brick my wrt54g that is now irreplacable?

					<p>Unless you are in a location where your wrt is only accessible via the public internet, why not just restrict ssh to the private network? For that matter, I don&#039;t even put a public address on my wrt&#039;s, but this requires dhcp and/or nat upstream and may not be feasible for the &#039;home&#039; user.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>What is the consequence of forgetting a openwrt/ssh root password?</p></blockquote></div><p>Boot to failsafe <br />&gt;mount_root<br />&gt;passwd&nbsp; (or just rm passwd)</p><p>- DL</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dl</strong> on 19 Mar 2006, 01:54)</p>
