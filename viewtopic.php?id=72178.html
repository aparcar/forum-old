					<p>Hey guys,</p><p>I already have an external network (Fritzbox 6490) and an internal one (Archer C7). Now I want to build up a dedicated Smart Home Wifi.</p><p>The Xiaomi Router 3C I got was not the right thing to order for that. Later I read that the Router is not able to have OpenWrt or so on it and only supports 20 computing devices (64 in total, but 44 IoT-devices (Yeelights and so on do not count ...)).</p><p>Now I am looking for a cheap Router (&lt;40€ in Germany) for a dedicated Smart Home network. The Router has to support like 40 wifi connections at the same time. I thought about 128 MB Ram (The 3C got 64 - seems not enough). Will that work if I just search a Router that supports OpenWrt with 128 MB Ram? Or are there any other limits (guess bandwith should not be a problem with the lights)?</p><p>Thank you in advance for your input.</p><p>Greetings<br />Andy</p>									</div>

					<p>If you have a Xaiomi in your hands now, there are some people building firmware for it (not sure what the difference between 3C and 3g is).<br />for example <a href="https://forum.lede-project.org/t/xiaomi-wifi-router-3g/5377/106">https://forum.lede-project.org/t/xiaomi … g/5377/106</a></p><p>Devices which are connected but not moving much data do not require many resources of the router, perhaps a few kB each for their data structures.&nbsp; The default in hostapd is 150 devices but that can be expanded.&nbsp; In theory, a wifi AP can connect 2007 clients at once but no one actually does that.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey mk24,</p><p>thank you for your answer.</p><p>The 3G seems to have a different CPU and way more RAM and also supports 5 GHz, has a USB-Slot and Gigabit-Ethernet:</p><p>3G - MT7621A - 128MB Flash - 256MB DDR3 RAM<br />3C - MT7628N - 16MB Flash - 64MB DDR2 RAM</p><p>Guess that firmware will not work on the 3C. But thank you for your find <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I guess I will just need to buy a new Router, but I do not know which one... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>andymaen</strong> on 28 Sep 2017, 17:25)</p>

					<p>Thank you tmo26 for that link!</p><p>I will go it through and find a router with 128MB-256MB RAM. Should be enough for 40-50 devices at the same time I guess. Already saw the Xiaomi 3G on that list too - maybe I will just get that one (long time shipping ...).</p>									</div>
