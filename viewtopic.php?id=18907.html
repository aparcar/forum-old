					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m having strange problems attaching usb devices to the router. I got following when I try to attach an mp3 player that serves as a SD card reader (there is a hub in it and internal memory). A SD card in the player is formatted as FAT and the internal memory is also FAT</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/dev#dmesg

Could anybody explain what wrong with inserting devices directly into the router?</p><p>And for some reason my usb sound adapter outputs only right channel! Tried &#039;madplay -S&#039; but it didn&#039;t help. <a href="http://www.andreaelectronics.com/buy/productdesc/superbeam_mic_bundle.htm">Here is my audio dongle hardware</a>. Device works perfectly on windows platform. Did anybody experience similar problems?</p>									</div>
