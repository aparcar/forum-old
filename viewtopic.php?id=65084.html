					<p>I have a TP-Link TL-MR3020 travel router that I&#039;m running on OpenWrt.&nbsp; It is normally configured to be a WIFI client and a WIFI AP simultaneously in routed mode.</p><p>There is a problem that if the WIFI Client isn&#039;t able to find the SSID it is configured for, the WIFI AP is also disabled.&nbsp; I had the same behavior occur on DD-WRT as well.&nbsp; The problem this causes is that if the AP is disabled, I can&#039;t go in to reconfigure the router for the hotel&#039;s WIFI unless I hard reset or connect to the router via ethernet.</p><p>Is there any way to change this?&nbsp; If this isn&#039;t possible, is there a way to assign a custom function to the WPS button that will disable the WIFI Client interface?&nbsp; I&#039;d be able to boot the router, then press the WPS button to make the AP show up.</p>									</div>

					<p>The actual issue (practical, not technical) is that the STAtion interface is NOT disabled.&nbsp; If you open the wireless file and look at the wifi-iface for the STAtion, you will find that the &quot;option disabled [value]&quot; is either 0 or the line does not exist.&nbsp; Setting this value to 1, (disabled) allows the AP side to resume functioning (after appropriate restart).&nbsp; I think a better description is that the wireless is &quot;hanging&quot; as it can not connect to the STAtion, but both sides are technically enabled.</p><p>There are a few types of solutions to the problem.&nbsp; </p><p>1 - Remove the iface section or update with the &quot;option disabled &#039;1&#039;<br />2 - Swap the wireless config file with another (1 enabled file, 1 disabled file)<br />3 - Use some type of &quot;wifi manager&quot;</p><p>For option 1 there are a couple of approaches.<br />1 - Remove the STAtion on boot (add to the Startup =&gt; Local Startup)<br />2 - Remove the STAtion based on a button action (works if you have a button or switch)<br />The first is best if you frequently change STAtions.&nbsp; I use this:&nbsp; <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=278230#p278230">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 30#p278230</a> and have run it both ways.&nbsp; I prefer the button action.</p><p>I consider the second more of an issue, as one needs to maintain multiple files, and the code is more complicated.&nbsp; You will still probably need to SCAN and select the new STAtion.&nbsp; You need a trigger action like above. </p><p>The third is to use some type of &quot;wifi manager&quot;.&nbsp; I use this:<br /><a href="http://www.gl-inet.com/forums/topic/wifimgr-tool-to-automaticaly-select-an-apstation-from-a-list-of-saved-aps/">http://www.gl-inet.com/forums/topic/wif … saved-aps/</a><br />which is based upon work done by dabyd64 here:&nbsp; <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=43352&amp;p=3">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 52&amp;p=3</a></p><p>One can also use a second radio, which eliminates the issue (which is related to the single radio running both sides of the connection).&nbsp; Most have reported it is not as fast as the above solutions and that you get better performance with the USB radio separated from the device by some distance.</p><p>If you have a button, try the first reference and put it into a script (/usr/bin/wifireset) and call it from the button (/etc/rc.button/reset usually).&nbsp; Below is my modified reset file as an example.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>.....
if [ &quot;$SEEN&quot; -lt 2 ]
then
    echo &quot;Wifi On Off from button&quot; &gt;&gt;/tmp/startup.log
        /usr/bin/wifionoff          

elif [ &quot;$SEEN&quot; -ge 5 ] &amp;&amp; [ &quot;$SEEN&quot; -lt 15 ]
then

logger &quot;Removing STA interface&quot;
        /usr/bin/wifireset 

elif [ &quot;$SEEN&quot; -gt 30 ]
then                                       
        echo &quot;FACTORY RESET&quot; &gt; /dev/console
        /usr/bin/flashleds &amp;
        jffs2reset -y &amp;&amp; reboot &amp;          
fi     </code></pre></div><p>Below are a number of other references to the issue.&nbsp; There are a few variations to the first ref I have given, including the one referred to by nenekofi:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=188725#p188725">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 25#p188725</a><br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=311832#p311832">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 32#p311832</a><br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=59678">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=59678</a><br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=56758">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=56758</a><br /><a href="http://www.gl-inet.com/forums/topic/switching-configs/">http://www.gl-inet.com/forums/topic/switching-configs/</a><br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=323650#p323650">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 50#p323650</a><br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=60291">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=60291</a><br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/ap_sta">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/ap_sta</a></p>									</div>

					<p>I followed the &quot;event driven&quot; method and it works.&nbsp; Thanks for your help.&nbsp; My big problem was that I didn&#039;t even know what to key words search for.</p><p>EDIT:&nbsp; I didn&#039;t see RangerZ&#039;s response until I implemented the automated script by MAX Hopper.&nbsp; I think Max Hopper&#039;s method works well for a client that expects to be connected to the same STAtion, such as WIFI Tethering on a phone because it will automatically restore the STAtion configuration.&nbsp; I have one situation where I would be doing this.&nbsp; But on a travel router that I would bring with me on trips, I think the button action method is the way to go (it would simply &quot;forget&quot; the previous STAtion).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Spook</strong> on 25 May 2016, 01:25)</p>

					<p>There is also another solution to <br />&quot;I think the button action method is the way to go (it would simply &quot;forget&quot; the previous STAtion)&quot;<br />is the use of ramdisk/swap for wireless configs.&nbsp; This also saves wear on the flash.<br />I have implemented my own solution which works well without buttons.
