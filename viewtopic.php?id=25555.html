					<p>Hi All,</p><p>After many months of testing finally we released GUI interface for OpenWRT. Our main focus was to build GUI which is fast, easy to use, different than most of the current solutions and allows easily to make desired configurations.</p><p>Now you can connect different devices to the same Mesh network and activate billing services with dynamic address IP.</p><p>Some features:</p><p>* An open interface to add or remove packages<br />* External Web server, AAA RADIUS and Chillispot support<br />* Support for Authentication, Authorization &amp; Accounting&nbsp; &nbsp;based on an&nbsp; &nbsp;industry standard RADIUS/EAP accounting system<br />* Support for secure authentication, encryption and access control&nbsp; through Web-based captive portal<br />* WISPr<br />* Dynamic and static IP to manage hotspot and wireless mesh network<br />* 802.11 abg (madWiFi) and 802.11 abgn (ath9K)</p><p>To see screenshots go to:<br /><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/skyspotmesh/skyspotos-gui-for-openwrt-4680088">http://www.slideshare.net/skyspotmesh/s â€¦ rt-4680088</a></p><p>Miro</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>skyspotmesh</strong> on 6 Jul 2010, 00:31)</p>

					<p>Hi aport,</p><p>Thank you for visual evaluation. Took us almost 18 months to built one and 4 months to test. Works great with RouterStation and is very fast! Some of our customers are managing legacy abg networks with RouterStation because easily they can manage up to 200 simultaneous users online. </p><p>The GUI is available as a standalone or with skyspot access points or Picostations2/2HP.&nbsp; The GUI is in two editions: Enterprise and Professional.</p><p>The Enterprise version is free of charge and is synchronized with skyspot dashboard srvices. You can use own devices like RouterStation, Accton or PicoStation2/2HP to connect them to WLAN Cloud Controller.</p><p>The Professional Edition was built for organizations and ISP&#039;s with own AAA Radius servers and own Web captive portal. By default also has a possibility to work with skyspot dashboard. SkySpot devices with Professional Edition are starting with number 7, e.g. billing gateway SBG700, indoor access point ST712 and outdoor access point SR752. These devices can be managed by your own infrastructure.</p><p>Both versions have an interface open for making changes or add/remove packages as required. More info you can find in the skyspot STORE section.</p><p>Miro</p>									</div>
