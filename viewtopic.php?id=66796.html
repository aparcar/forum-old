					<p>Not completely clear what you ask. There is a way to <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence">build your own</a> version of OpenWRT for a supported device. The wiki is somewhat confusing, but the following works for me:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>hvdkamer@openwrt:~$ git clone https://git.openwrt.org/15.05/openwrt.git

hvdkamer@openwrt:~/openwrt$ ./scripts/feeds install -a
hvdkamer@openwrt:~/openwrt$ make defconfig
hvdkamer@openwrt:~/openwrt$ make menuconfig
  =&gt; select your router
hvdkamer@openwrt:~/openwrt$ make</code></pre></div><p>If successful you can find the images in bin/&lt;your cpu&gt;/ directory. This procedure uses the source code and that you can edit. Is that answering your question?</p>									</div>

Firmware on most commercial routers is partly closed, not documented and very difficult to understand. A router with OpenWrt is as the name suggests open. My commands showed how to build a default firmware from the source code. And that you can study, modify etc, and then compile again. That image can easily flashed to your router to see if it works or why not.</p><p>My suggestion for a router which is fully supported by OpenWrt -- this is also the firmware they are shipped with, although the webinterface looks different -- is one from <a href="http://www.gl-inet.com/">GL.iNet</a>. I started with the older 6416 but today I would have bought an <a href="http://www.gl-inet.com/ar150/">GL-AR150</a> which is $25-$27. Not expensive for a great learning experience...</p><p>BTW I&#039;m not affiliated with GL.iNet in any way. If you want it a little bit cheaper you can shop for comaptible routers in China (Aliexpress, DealExtreme, etc.). But if the saving is worth it?</p>									</div>

I use a minimal -- no graphical interface, only a SSH server -- Debian install in VirtualBox which is running in Ubuntu or Windows 7. Which I use depends on other things I must do that day...</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>harvey84 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>second the main language is c</p></blockquote></div><p>No. I know very little of C, but I can build my own images according to my wishes. You set you wanted to see how you can replace a logo in the webinterface. That is probably HTML, CSS or Javascript.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>harvey84 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>and if there is a cd or pdf books to learn linux ?</p></blockquote></div><p>There are. But I learned almost evrything byy repeating what others did and then see if I understood what they were doing. And then experimenting with parameters found in the man pages. And so on.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>harvey84 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>there is no way to edit an existing firmware<br />like zte or d-link or any routers i have to flash<br />a new os like OpenWRT(open source) in order to edit it at any time or customise it right?</p></blockquote></div><p>You could potentially edit existing firmware. But that is usually very difficult. If I want to learn something I find it much easier to start with something working and then breaking it. Because then you know what you did. The other way around is much more difficult.</p><p>You said you want to understand how firmware works? Why then the hard way? Understanding the OpenWrt firmware is much easier and give you the insights you want. And after that you could do it the hard way with unknown firmware. But again I get the impression that you are starting from almost no knowledge. Make it more fun for yourself by first doing something that is possible and not that hard.</p><p>What routers do you have. AR they supported in OpenWrt. If so, no need to buy something new. But the example I gave is cheap price if you want to learn.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>harvey84 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>you see i thought it like this forum script<br />i can go to the files and edit it is that possible with routers?</p></blockquote></div><p>Theoretically yes. But only with a lot of knowledge you at this moment don&#039;t have. The path I suggest is more practical. You edit the files before you compile it into a OpenWrt firmware which you flash onto a device. </p><div class="quotebox"><cite>harvey84 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>i just didn&#039;t know i thought i could edit that router or use it to learn on it you know<br />it an old router i have i thought i use it as personal server if know what i mean to try on it</p></blockquote></div><p>Again give us a exact name, so we can see if it is already supported in OpenWrt. If yes, you have a platform for experimenting. If no, again, make it yourself easy and buy a cheap, supported router. You don&#039;t want to experiment on your router to the internet. At least not until you know it will work.</p><p>I started with a&nbsp; TP-Link WR741ND. Then I did a TP-Link WDR4300 which is now my router to the internet. Both were easy, but I learned how OpenWrt works. On the first I wrote a Lua script -- the language which generates the router webpages -- which worked. Now I am helping with a Sitecom WLR-6000. That one is not supported yet. But knowledge how OpenWrt works helped in finding necessary information. Part is documented by me in the <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/sitecom/wlr-6000">wiki</a>. But it cost many, many hours. So just start with something that works first <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p>									</div>

And that is learning...</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>harvey84 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>i want to understand the code that is why i want to edit that zte router it an old one not supported</p></blockquote></div><p>Again, which router do you have? For learning, start with something simple. My suggestion:</p><p>1) make a (virtual) Debian/Ubuntu system with the <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence">build requirements</a><br />2) build the latest version from git:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>hvdkamer@openwrt:~$ git clone https://git.openwrt.org/openwrt.git
hvdkamer@openwrt:~$ cd openwrt/
hvdkamer@openwrt:~/openwrt$ ./scripts/feeds update -a
hvdkamer@openwrt:~/openwrt$ ./scripts/feeds install -a
hvdkamer@openwrt:~/openwrt$ make menuconfig</code></pre></div><p>Then select your supported router in the first four selections. Don&#039;t change anything else. The first thing you want to prove is that you can build a working firmware for your router. Do exit and save the .config. Now do a make and wait several hours. No errors? Is there something with your router name in /bin/&lt;depends&gt; ? Try to flash it through the normal sysupgrade procedure,</p><p>3) If successful try adding a package of interest, repeat</p><p>What your are doing is building from source. And that you can study. The LuCI package contains AFAIK the scripts which make the webinterface. You can change stuff and then do a rebuild. You can also try to see where the files are in a running system. You can change them, but after a reboot they are lost.That is why building the changes into the firmware is necessary. Another option is using extroot where the changes are stored on a USB flashdrive.</p><p>So you see it is better to use a working system. If one of the above steps goes wrong, you know how to revert. In a unknown system it is often not clear why something doesn&#039;t work.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>harvey84 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>No. I know very little of C, but I can build my own images according to my wishes.</p></blockquote></div><p>if you know very little of c how could you manage to build your own image</p></blockquote></div><p>See above. The developers of OpenWrt made a build system even I can use <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>harvey84 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>yes, edit one for now not build my own image , and i said to replace the logo because it sample not going to take much work</p></blockquote></div><p>Do it in the OpenWrt firmware. Change the stylesheet or add a &quot;Welcome Harvey84&quot; page. In OpenWrt because we have the source this is relatively easy. Relative because it will probably take you at least a day <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />. But this has a good chance of success and that is in a first experiment a good motivation to go on.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>harvey84 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>you know how i learn php ,html?</p></blockquote></div><p>That is exactly what I suggest above. It is the way I learn things as well.Breaking working stuff, repairing it, get an idea how it works and then enhancing it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>harvey84 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>tell me you get what i mean please</p></blockquote></div><p>I think I do. See above.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>harvey84 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>and i will also look for supported router to continue on it</p></blockquote></div><p>I got the impression above that you already have one? Please tell what routers you already have. And give the model numbers, not ZTE. I for example have a TP-Link WDR4300, Sitecom WLR-6000 and GL.iNet 6416.</p>									</div>

					<p>The default webinterface in CC is a bit old fashioned. Fine by me, but if I show it to other people they don&#039;t like it and therefor won&#039;t install OpenWrt. Bit of a shame that a flashy interface is more important but that is how the world works these days...</p><p>So I found <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=59696">this</a>. Haven&#039;t tried it yet, but that could be an interesting start for your second build. It contains pointers to the source, so experimenting will be much easier. I will try it myself after I finishing my other experiment.</p>									</div>
