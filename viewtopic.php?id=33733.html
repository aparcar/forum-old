The hardware has adequate open-source drivers.<br />2.) It shouldn&#039;t take too much to get OpenWRT running as DD-WRT was originally a fork of the same code.<br />3.)

					<p>Be aware that there are many complaints on Amazon.com reviews of bad radios on the Buffalo. The WNDR3800 is a lot newer so it hasn&#039;t had the time to collect as many good or bad reviews. I&#039;m having no issues with mine though and my house is like a faraday cage.</p>									</div>

					<p>The WNDR3800 is quite similar to WNDR3700 which has a very good track record. I believe the flashing/recovery routine is much better on Netgear as well, might be something to consider if you are the type that flash a lot. Unless you absolutely need the 32MB of ROM I&#039;d say the Netgear is the better choice.</p>									</div>
