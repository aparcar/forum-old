					<p>I found a way to boot my x86 system into OpenWRT Backfire from a USB drive using Syslinux.&nbsp; Some highlights:</p><p>* Boot from USB without compiling custom kernel<br />* Store multiple versions or images on the same drive, select one during boot<br />* Create live USB in Windows, no Linux skill necessary<br />* Keep USB drive as FAT or FAT32 volume, no need to erase data</p><p>For step-by-step explanations, see my blog <a href="http://macbruins.wordpress.com/2011/09/01/easy-live-usb-for-x86-openwrt/">Easy Live USB for x86 OpenWRT</a></p><p>Is anyone interested in instructions on making live USB in Linux instead of Windows?&nbsp; If you are, I can write them up and put them in the wiki.</p><p>A quick rundown of my method</p><p>* A desktop Linux system usually boots in these steps:&nbsp; BIOS loads Grub, Grub loads kernel and initail rootfs image, rootfs sets up the real root file system and transfers control to it.<br />* OpenWRT skips the initial rootfs image.&nbsp; Kernel goes directly to the real root file system.<br />* The official OpenWRT x86 kernel does not have built-in USB drivers.&nbsp; These drivers are in loadable kernel modules, stored in the root file system.<br />* For booting from USB, this becomes a catch-22:&nbsp; Without the root file system, kernel can&#039;t load USB modules.&nbsp; Without the USB modules, kernel can&#039;t access the root file system.<br />* To work around this problem, I created the initial rootfs image from the real root file system.<br />* I still needed to load kernel and the new initial rootfs during boot.&nbsp; For this I used Syslinux.&nbsp; When booting from USB Syslinux is easier to use than Grub.<br />* Instead of using an entire USB drive for one firmware image, I chose to store the images as files on the drive.<br />* When setting up the real root file system, my new rootfs first mounts the USB drive.&nbsp; It then finds the firmware image and mount that through a loop device.&nbsp; Finally it transfers control to the root file system.<br />* When changes are made from within OpenWRT, they are saved to the image files.</p><p>Feedback, comments, suggestions are appreciated.</p><br /><p>William</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MacBruins</strong> on 4 Sep 2011, 08:22)</p>

					<p>Interesting. I have some old Pentium Celeron and/or AMD Duron computers that are not in used. Perhaps, when I get some free time, I sure will like to give this a try. Thank you for sharing.</p>									</div>
