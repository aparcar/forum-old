					<p>Hey folks!</p><p>This old and cheap modem was bricked while trying to flash the factory firmware and now all lights are blinking. I thought it is a good opportunity to gain some experience with unbricking by serial connections, even I don&#039;t need this modem anymore. </p><p>So, I read a lot on this forum about this specific device and ended up flashing the device successfully with both OpenWrt &quot;factory&quot; and &quot;sysupgrade&quot; firmwares and also the stock firmware on the TP-link site.</p><p>But: the problem is still there! All lights blink after restart of the modem.</p><p>Setup:</p><p>- Ubuntu 14.04 32-bit<br />- PuTTy<br />- tftpgui</p><p>Any advice plz?</p>									</div>
