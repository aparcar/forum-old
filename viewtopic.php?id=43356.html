					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to build a package from the sources and not downloading them.</p><p>When you compile a package what actually happen is: <br />1) The package archive is downloaded from the server and extracted in the buildroot<br />2) The patches are applied<br />3) The source is compiled</p><p>I managed to compile the sources: by using:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; mkdir -p $(PKG_BUILD_DIR)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; $(CP) ./src/* $(PKG_BUILD_DIR)/</p><p>So that&#039;s copies the sources to the build dir but it doesn&#039;t path... I tired to call $(call Build/Quilt/Default) but It didn&#039;t work...</p><p>Also tried to compile with QUILT=1 which seems that it runs the script but the patched were not copied, I tired to copy manually still doesn&#039;t work... </p><p>Any ideas?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mapisto</strong> on 5 Apr 2013, 20:17)</p>
