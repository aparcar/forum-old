					<p>Is there a practical difference (besides wifi support) between a broadcom installation with the 2.6 kernel, and the 2.4 kernel one? I&#039;ve been using DD-WRT for a while now on my WRT54GL, and I was looking at OpenWrt as a way to trim the &quot;fat&quot; off.</p><p>If you all don&#039;t mind me asking, what explicitly is meant by &quot;unstable&quot; as far as broadcom wifi on 2.6 goes? What happened that made wifi support terminate between 2.4 and 2.6?</p>									</div>

					<p>The wifi driver is written for 2.4 and is binary only. It would have to be adapted for 2.6. But there are no sources available.</p><p>There is a new free implementation, but it is not complete yet.</p><p>See the other thread about broadcom driver on 2.6 ...</p>									</div>
