					<p>Hi David,</p><p>I&#039;m using your LEDE build on WRT1200AC v1 and previously I was using the build from June. When I upgraded to the latest (timestamped 2016-09-10 14:21) started to have problems connecting to WAN. </p><p>The problem was very weird as it looks the modem (my provider is Virgin Media UK where I use their router in modem-only mode) was not giving a WAN address to the router. I connected a laptop instead of the router and I got no problem with getting the address from the modem. Using ifconfig I noticed that the router was sending packets (TX &gt; 0) but got 0 (RX=0) packets from the modem. </p><p>Since when I did upgrade I used sysupgrade with keeping the configuration I decided to update to the same version but using factory image which would blank my config. This got me further as after the reboot I was able to see some packets getting to the router from the modem. After a number of reboots (modem + router) I found out that if I reboot modem and at the same time the router I was able to get the WAN IP on the router.</p><p>Now I got a second issue which seem to be a bit more difficult as I cannot find anything in logs.</p><p>From time to time the connectivity to the outside world disappears. I&#039;m not able to ping any host (either via IP or full name). Querying DNSes (nslookup) is either extremely slow or it does not work at all - tried on the clients and directly on the router. The WAN has IP assigned. Bringing WAN down and up again does not help either. There is nothing in logs (logread) or in dmesg - literally no new contents since the issue appears.</p><p>I&#039;m a bit stumble how to debug it and my gut feeling is that this is either new wifi driver or the new kernel. For posterity I attach my /etc/config/network and /etc/config/dhcp but the same settings were used in June release of your LEDE<br />with no issues:</p><p>/etc/config/network<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;loopback&#039;

I cannot reliably pinpoint and correlate the issue with anything specific I&#039;m doing. It can happen 5 minutes after a router reboot but it can also happen after 4h running with no issues. I did not see any correlation with specific clients either. </p><div class="quotebox"><cite>davidc502 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>2. Will a keepalive ping change anything with the connection?</p></blockquote></div><p>Yesterday I had only one laptop connected via wifi and a linux box (nas) via Ethernet. The issue happened after 3h of work. On laptop my connection was constantly active (Citrix + a ssh tunnel) and the issue appeared in the middle of a active transfer. </p><p>I did try keepalive connection via ping. I pinged a remote machine (google.com and I used a DNS name as well as IP address as the target). To be precise: when the issue happens I can login to the router from all clients in my network. I can ping them within my network - the only problem is the connectivity to the outside world. I thought it might be forwarding hence I have a ping running on the router constantly but this does not help either. I did check and when the issues happens I the router does have WAN IP.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>davidc502 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>How far back in time was the image that worked?</p></blockquote></div><p>I had your LEDE June release (Jun 19 or June 06 - do not remember exactly) but I do not have a copy of it so I went back a month using stock LEDE from the end of August. This did not have any influence and I still got the same issue with connectivity.<br />Currently I use mrfreeze OpenWRT release from June 4 which is based on 4.4.11 kernel. This works very stable though I do not have such network performance as with your release from June - especially on 5G.</p><p>Lastly, I do not use neither QOS nor SQM but I did not try to remove them.<br />When I flash it back your release, I&#039;ll remove QOS and SQM, and see if the issue persist.</p><p>Could it be the latest firmware included in mwlwifi?

					<p>Hi David - question for you.</p><p>Background: Super noob, first open source router install. Have a 1900ACS, and I used your newest Shelby build.</p><p>Question: I did my best to review this thread, and I didn&#039;t see any solution to the USB drive issue a few folks were talking about. Basically, I&#039;m trying to mount an external USB 3.0 hard drive.</p><p>I have everything else running swimmingly (wifi, ethernet, internet, etc.) I was also able to install Samba. However, when I try to install some of the other packages that appear to be important (listed on your &quot;Pre-Installed Packages&quot; page), I get error messages like the following:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Installing kmod-fs-nfs (4.4.21-1) to root...<br />Downloading [....]kmod-fs-nfs_4.4.21-1_arm_cortex-a9_vfpv3.ipk.<br />Collected errors:<br /> * satisfy_dependencies_for: Cannot satisfy the following dependencies for kmod-fs-nfs:<br /> * &nbsp; &nbsp; kernel (= 4.4.21-1-d51c65d2028741629ed4cbd7397f11f8) * &nbsp; &nbsp; kernel (= 4.4.21-1-d51c65d2028741629ed4cbd7397f11f8) * &nbsp; &nbsp; kernel (= 4.4.21-1-d51c65d2028741629ed4cbd7397f11f8) * <br /> * opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package kmod-fs-nfs.</p></blockquote></div><p>Maybe I&#039;m getting ahead of myself. Do I need to update the kernel before proceeding? How do I do that? Or can you direct me towards a different solution?</p><p>Cheers!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nlilovic</strong> on 18 Sep 2016, 04:54)</p>

					<p>@nlilovic,</p><p>Did you change the package sources in system - software - configuration to the alternate location from davidc502?<br />Kernel 4.4.21 seems odd, since the firmware image from 09-09-2016 uses kernel 4.4.19!</p>									</div>
