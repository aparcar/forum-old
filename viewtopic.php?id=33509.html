					<p>I am an experienced Windows (C++) programmer with very little exposure to Linux and embedded systems.</p><p>I have this idea of a minimal build of OpenWrt, with routing, wifi, firewall and Luci stripped out (along with any other unnecessary stuff) so that it leaves enough space (on a router with 4MB flash) for installation of Asterisk (exposed through its WAN interface), potentially turning a $15 router into an Asterisk box.</p><p>Is this idea feasible? I am ready to spend the necessary hours and buy a couple of devices to try it out, if somebody can point me in the right direction.</p><p>Thanks,<br />-gkdada</p>									</div>

					<p>Sure, install openwrt minimal build and run opkg install asterisk18.<br />Plenty people are already running this on their $15 routers.</p>									</div>
