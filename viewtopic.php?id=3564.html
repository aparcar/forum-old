					<p>I have another router (192.168.1.0 - which just acts as a switch) connected to port 4 of my WRT54GS running openwrt (192.168.0.0). my linksys router is connected to the internet, so all machines connected to it work fine. However, I cannot access any machines in 192.168.1.0 and vice versa obviously because I need to configure the routing table in openwrt. Can anyone please give some advice how to do that?</p><p>Thanks, Thomas</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, technically, if your &quot;other router&quot; is giving out IP addresses, it isn&#039;t acting as a switch.&nbsp; I would try switching your other router into true switch mode, then everything should get their IPs from your linksys and the problem would go away.&nbsp; Is the other router&#039;s wan port plugged into port 4?&nbsp; If so then it should automatically know how to get to 192.168.0.1.&nbsp; If the other router can get to the linksys but the linksys cannot get to the other router, Something like below - added to the linksys should work, no guarantees though</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>route add 192.168.1.0 gw 192.168.0.XXX</p></blockquote></div><p>Where 192.168.0.XXX is the wan address of the other router when you check it&#039;s status.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks I&#039;ll try that. DHCP is disabled on it. Last time I gave the other router the IP 192.168.0.2 (which is the configuration menu and also the integrated print server). I was able to reach it from the openwrt router but I was unable to reach the machines connected to the other one, although I gave them static IP addresses (192.168.0.x). However, those machines were able to reach all machines connected to both routers.</p>									</div>

					<p>you have wan (internet) and lan (192.168.0.x) and a third segment (192.168.1.x) - you need 3 ip&#039;s for your wrt54g and must split the switch into a 3 port switch and a second wan port for (192.168.1.x),<br />or you must change your netmask from 255.255.255.0 to 255.255.0.0 (in all clients from 192.168.0.0 or 192.168.1.x -&nbsp; and also the wrt54g)</p>									</div>
