					<p>Hi everyone.<br />I&#039;m trying to fix a bricked Dlink DSL 502t and load openwrt, and could use some help. Please forgive my lack of knowledge as up until yesterday I&#039;d never done anything in this area.</p><p>(As is always does apparently) Upgrading the firmware completely destroyed it, and in my ignorance mtd3 (among others) has been wiped. mtd2 (with adam2) appears to still be intact and functioning.</p><p>I&#039;ve built a jtag cable and I&#039;m trying to connect it to tjag now, but I can&#039;t for the life of me get anything to work. The pin layout on the connector is very suspect, as it is labeled</p><p>8&nbsp; 9&nbsp; 10 11 12 13 14<br />1&nbsp; 2&nbsp; &nbsp;3&nbsp; &nbsp;4&nbsp; &nbsp;5&nbsp; &nbsp;6&nbsp; &nbsp;7</p><p>where as all the diagrams online show for headers in this fashion:</p><p>2&nbsp; 4&nbsp; 6&nbsp; 8&nbsp; 10&nbsp; 12<br />1&nbsp; 3&nbsp; 5&nbsp; 7&nbsp; &nbsp;9&nbsp; &nbsp;11</p><br /><p>I&#039;ve been attempting to follow this guide: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=7742">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=7742</a><br />but he only very briefly covers the section on how to modify a cable to fit properly (incase you haven&#039;t spotted already the header has 14 pins instead of 12)</p><p>My cable follows this diagram: <a href="http://www.t-hack.com/wiki/images/e/e7/Wrt_jtag-kabel_schaltung.gif">http://www.t-hack.com/wiki/images/e/e7/ â€¦ altung.gif</a></p><p>If anyone could help me interpret this information, and maybe give me some insight into how the pins need to be connected, or what I am doing wrong, I would greatly appreciate it.</p><p>Thanks in advance</p><br /><p>ADDED:<br />I know there is some form of a connection occuring, as hooking the cables up in different ways and probing returns a different CPU chip ID, either all 0s, all 1s or 100000....</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>granyte</strong> on 26 Nov 2012, 07:58)</p>
