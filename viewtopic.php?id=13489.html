					<p>&quot;none&quot; adsl2 router will be compatible with OpenWrt because OpenWrt acts already as router.<br />You will need buy a ADSL ethernet modem (or yes a router but with capability acting as &quot;bridge&quot; modem) like SpeedTouch series ( 510 , 536 , 546 )<br />In France Speedtouch rocks for its stability &amp; performance.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not sure if this means it is ADSL2+ already, but my (AR7) D-Link DSL-G604t shows (in /proc/avalanche/avsar_modem_stats) 11 Mb/s maximum attainable rate on my current connection to my ISP, though my subscription is only 1 Mb/s... this is with the ADSL driver in Kamikaze.</p>									</div>

					<p>AR7 is nearly stable on my regular ADSL connection (build 7038).&nbsp; It hangs on occasion (multiple bit-torrents at the same time) requiring a reboot to get things back up.&nbsp; This is on a 3mbps connection.&nbsp; I can&#039;t speak for ADSL2+ since it&#039;s not offered in my area, but I&#039;m pretty sure others on here have it working.</p><p>I&#039;ve been meaning to try something more recent and therefore built 9590 the other day.&nbsp; Just haven&#039;t had a chance to put it on the router (DG834Gv2) just yet.</p><p>I believe there are also Atheros boards with built in ADSL2+ but I have no idea what models.&nbsp; Might want to do some searching.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>KillaB</strong> on 26 Nov 2007, 05:11)</p>

I have always think that 16MB for a device to run 2.6 kernel and a few other programs that deals with<br />adsl and pppoe/pppoa et al is only just about right. But as soon as wifi and other things are also jammed packed into it, it becomes a little short in memory. What&#039;s more if you start to have bit torrent and other stuff .....</p><p>Regards.</p>									</div>
