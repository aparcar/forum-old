					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I would like to know if anybody tried the Belkin F9K1103 (N750 DB). It is highly rated on topten reviews and looks like a nice piece of work! I have somewhat difficulties finding adapter information though... I looked in the TOH and didn`t see any posting for that model... maybe i was tired and missed it but does anybody tried putting openwrt on it ?</p><p>Also, let&#039;s say that oenwrt is not supported for this router what would be an equivalent router to the belkini apart for the WNDR3700/3800/...</p><p>I am looking for good Max Throughput (Mbps), usb port ( to put usb wireless stick on the router as the primary internet access), Simultaneous Dual Band...</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>									</div>
