					<p>I have a DLink DIR600 A1 router, which was running Backfire 10.03.1-rc4.&nbsp; I tried to upgrade to the latest trunk, and inadvertently ran a sysupgrade with the wrong image (JFFS2.)&nbsp; After the upgrade the router sits with only the power button illuminated.&nbsp; I went thru the usual stuff, trying to get a recovery console, but it appears that the ethernet is not accessible.&nbsp; So I built a serial cable, got into uboot and using ymodem uploaded the file squashfs factory bin successfully:<br />---<br />ar7240&gt; iminfo&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />## Checking Image at 81000000 ...&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Image Name:&nbsp; &nbsp;MIPS OpenWrt Linux-2.6.32.27&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Created:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2011-07-15&nbsp; &nbsp;0:45:56 UTC&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Image Type:&nbsp; &nbsp;MIPS Linux Kernel Image (lzma&nbsp; compressed)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Data Size:&nbsp; &nbsp; 892906 Bytes = 872 kB&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Load Address: 80060000&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Entry Point:&nbsp; 80060000&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Verifying Checksum ...

					<p>OK, figured it out and recovered.&nbsp; The magic invocation, after ymodem transfer of the image was, at UBoot prompt:</p><p>erase 0xbf040000 +390018</p><p>cp.b 81000000 bf040000 390018</p><p>bootm 0xbf040000</p><p>and the system comes up working.</p>									</div>

					<p>Answer to cconn: Sorry, I posted a second time before seeing your query.</p><p>Yes, there is a recovery console feature, which has saved me in the past.&nbsp; Apparently tho, from my googling it seems if you mistakenly upload a jffs2 image it not only trashes the router, it messes up the ethernet too.</p><p>It took me a while to realize I was never going to get the recovery console, after which I took the serial cable path, which allowed me to recover.</p>									</div>
