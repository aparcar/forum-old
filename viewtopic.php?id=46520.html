					<p>well AFAIK if you &quot;poweroff&quot;, means NO SOFTWARE is been executed from the cpu anymore, so you have NO WAY to turn it on, other than a hardware reset.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nebbia88</strong> on 29 Sep 2013, 19:57)</p>

					<p>You don&#039;t specify your router that runs OpenWrt.<br />That makes answering your question impossible.<br />See point 4 of <a href="http://sincealtair.blogspot.co.uk/2010/04/how-to-ask-questions-in-technical-forum.html">How to ask questions in a technical forum</a></p><p>However:<br />Using the router itself is unlikely to work on many OpenWrt platforms.</p><p>Why ?<br />1. In order to wake up at 7pm your router needs a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_clock">RTC</a> - because it needs to know the time if it should wake up by itself. Many routers dont have that hardware.<br />2. Some hardware use real switches, some HW doesnt have any; so sometimes a &quot;real&quot; hardware reset is happening<br />3. Hibernation implies power management logic. Most router hardware does not use that in the CPU.<br />You can disable Ethernet(LAN,WAN) and/or use EEE/802.3az if your unit has support. Disabling of wireless radios is possible in OpenWrt.these features.</p><p>Of course you can create some elaborate hardware project (Arduino ?) that has a RTC, different IO Pins that you solder onto the router (replacing hardware switchs with software) ...</p><p>A Netgear WNDR3700v1 uses around 5.3W with active WLAN idle and 3.7W with WLAN disabled. </p><p>Even in Europe disabling 3.7W-&gt;0W for 7 hours that should be amount to 9.5kWh in a year. Even if pay 0.30$ per kWh thats 2.85$ a year. So - did you optimize every other appliance in your household ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zloop</strong> on 29 Sep 2013, 22:06)</p>

					<p>@zloop,<br />Thanks for the information.<br />I am using a TP Link TL-WR740N router running&nbsp; ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT (12.09, r36088)<br />I was wondering if OpenWrt could be used like another GNU/Linux box has power management. Based on your points 1-3, using the router like a more capable desktop box does seem possible. It was really a curiosity sparked by tinkering with wakealarm in Debian. Disabling the radio for those time periods might better meet my goal.<br />How did you generate the Netgear WNDR3700v1 power usage measurement? The annual power savings listed would be marginal.</p><p>While I could go through every outlet in the house, its out of scope.<br />I wanted to try out something I could easily tweak the software. My outlets don&#039;t have an open firmware, unfortunately.</p>									</div>

What you need is a power switch with a built-in timer that you can set, i.e. OFF @12:00AM and back to ON @7:00AM, etc. This will ensure all the AC/DC adapters attached to the power switch will be a complete OFF.</p>									</div>

					<p>A power switch with a built-in timer will in itself consume some power running the timer. </p><p>Around here you can borrow a single socket power meter that shows the usage in KwH from the local electrical utility. I tried it with my router, dsl modem and two switches, the load was so low it hardly registered, if I remember correctly it was something like .02 KwH.</p><p>Edit - I just found my notes from then: max power consumption for a dlink router , a tplink adsl modem and two NN 8 port switches was 12.15 watts, over a eight hour period they consumed&nbsp; .009 KwH.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zzz2002</strong> on 1 Oct 2013, 17:29)</p>
