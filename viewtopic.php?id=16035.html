					<p>what is the bin number for WRT160N, i&#039;ve been having this problem where my brother and i, when playing starcraft together (in the same game with an extra player) the game starts to lag. However, when one of us leave, the lags gone. Do you guys have solutions for fixing this problem, i read someones article about fixing the problem, but he said i needed to get the * bin for my router model. I have no clue what hes talking about, does anyone have a solution for this problem?</p>									</div>

					<p>As far as I know we do not support the WRT160N currently. None of the developers have that specific router. Patches that add support, or donations of routers so we can add support are welcomed.</p>									</div>
