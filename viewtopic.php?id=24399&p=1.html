					<p>I opened my dir-825 and found out that there is extra usb port. even I never soldered in my life, I want to try. so I cut one usb line and soldered the line with extra port. but when I connect the line to external usb harddisk(with no power), the power turns into the hdd but system cannot catch the usb port differences. Maybe I made a mistake when I soldered so the hole was broken or is not connected. For those who want to try himself, I am putting few links that I looked. </p><p>First, the picture of the router(on right down, there is one unpluged usb port)<br/><a href="http://fs.textcube.com/blog/4/47730/attach/XfapcJiKbO.jpg">http://fs.textcube.com/blog/4/47730/attach/XfapcJiKbO.jpg</a></p><p>Second, Usb cable schematics.<br/><a href="http://pinouts.ru/SerialPortsCables/usb_cable_pinout.shtml">http://pinouts.ru/SerialPortsCables/usb_cable_pinout.shtml</a></p><p>If you success the plug-in, please post it here!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nikescar</strong> on 21 Apr 2010, 17:15)</p>

					<p>I think that the usb filter caps / resistors are not soldered. Try tracing the D+ and D- USB lines on the PCB. I think there is some sort of a small chip that is soldered for the first USB port, but not for the second. If thats the case you can try to get one of that chip (probably not easy), but i think that they are much harder to solder ;-)</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi!</p><p>No, I live in Hungary. That was only a question, before I bought my DIR-825. When I good think, the NA and EU versions differs only by WiFi channel.<br/>So, I have tested the ftp speed (with vsftpd): the read speed is very good. With my Samsung S2 160GB the read speed was 21 MB/s average.</p><p>vargalex</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>devnullfast wrote:</cite><blockquote><div class="quotebox"><cite>vargalex wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Hi!</p><p>Have you the EU, or NA version?

					<p>Good day 2all.</p><p>I&#039;m going to solder in second USB into one of the DIR-825 I own and it would be very helpful if somebody post here some photos with second USB port soldered in. I&#039;m most interested in looking at the correct place where the line bridges should be soldered. While I&#039;m pretty sure that I had traced the lines right, it wouldn&#039;t hurt to double check anyway :-).</p>									</div>
