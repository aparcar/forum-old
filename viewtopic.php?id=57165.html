					<p>I am using a router with openwrt as a switch. Connected to this router I have 2 wireless AP’s, also running openwrt. This AP’s are in fact simple wireless routers in which I have disabled dhcp (so they are considered dumb AP’s). Also to this router it&#039;s connected a computer (LAN Port 3) which generates traffic to 224.0.0.x, 224.0.0.y (multicast groups).</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1175108/diagramaRede.jpg" alt="Network Diagram" /></span></p><br /><p>How can I configure the Router (Switch) to send to AP1 (LAN Port 1) all multicast packets with respect only to group 224.0.0.x, and to AP2 (LAN Port 2) all multicast packets with respect only to groups 224.0.0.x and 224.0.0.y?</p><p>I know that IGMP snooping, when activated, allows the switch to forward multicast traffic to the links where that traffic has been solicited. But, for instance, I want to prevent all wireless clients connected to AP1 to assign (and receive) multicast traffic concerning to 224.0.0.y group.</p>									</div>
