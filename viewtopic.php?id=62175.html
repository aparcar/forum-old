					<p>Hi.</p><p>I have a WNDR4000 that i have flashed with openWrt.</p><p>My ISP delivers 300/300Mbps and with the stock firmware on the router the speedtest shows 320 down and 310 up normaly. But after i flashed it with the openWrt the new 15.5 Rc3 it just get max 180 down and around 100 up.</p><p>What can the reason be for this? Is there a way to improve this? i tried the software once before and then i get over 300 but not in any test now. </p><p>MÃ¸ller</p>									</div>

					<p>The reason is probably NAT. TP-Link routers usually come with hardware NAT, which means the hardware has an accelerator for NAT operations. However, there is no driver for that in mainline linux, so OpenWrt has no way of using that accelerator, in which case all the work has to be done by the CPU alone. In your case, the CPU is slower than average but for connections &gt;200Mbps there aren&#039;t many routers in general that can deliver full speed with open source software and drivers. So, you either need a faster router or a seperate device to do the actual NAT routing (in which case your current router would only server as an access point). Btw. if you have an IPv6 connection, you should be able to achieve faster transfers speeds, too, because in this case you can avoid NAT.</p><p>Edit: Sorry. I was mistaken about your router model. I thought it&#039;s a TP-Link device which is wrong. Nevertheless the explanation is probably valid anyway since Netgear claims as well to use hardware NAT.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>silentcreek</strong> on 16 Jan 2016, 04:32)</p>

In this case other users with the same device may have more insights. But then again, I still have some doubts about that because there are routers with faster CPUs that don&#039;t even reach 300Mbps without hardware acceleration. But I may as well be wrong, so someone with the actual device should be able to give a definitive answer.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>per.egil.moller wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Is there something i can try to improv it?</p></blockquote></div><p>Hard to say. If it&#039;s really a regression and used to work faster on older builds, you might try these builds again and from there move to newer builds to isolate the issue. Configuration-wise you probably can&#039;t do anything about it. But it might be worth while looking at the processes and cpu usage during larger (and fast) transfers. If the CPU is under maximum load caused by &#039;sirq&#039;, it&#039;s an idication of hardware limitations.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>per.egil.moller wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I have a Asustore 604T that have a DHCP server and are very powerfull, i will use this as dhcp to handel the nat since is have 2 ethernetport ports. i set the router to 192.168.1.1 static and let the nas do the dhcp job and nat.</p></blockquote></div><p> I hope you have proper security measures in play. Personally, I wouldn&#039;t wan&#039;t a server that hosts important or personal data act as my internet gateway. I&#039;d rather buy a Banana Pi or something like that, add a USB gigabit ethernet adaptor and use that as a router and firewall, then connect the previous router as an access point. But&#039;s that up to personal preference (and maybe paranoia).</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi.</p><p>Thx for your answer. I will run a IDS and IPS system on the NAS and it will just be connected to a sandbox until i now its safe. </p><p>I have given up to run openwrt on the router, but with stock firmware it has no problem keeping up but the stock firmware is not stable.</p>									</div>
