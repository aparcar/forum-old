					<p>I have begun to scour the &#039;net for info after seeing the wifi router internet radio on mightyohm. My question is- Is there a package or something that can be used to interface a handheld walkie or ham radio to a usb sound card that is shown on the mightyohm site? the cm119 datasheet is here= <a href="http://datasheets.weeqoo.com/88888/200712393442871.pdf">http://datasheets.weeqoo.com/88888/200712393442871.pdf</a> and it works well with the wifi radio. I saw something called thelinkbox but i think it is unrelated to what I&#039;m trying to do. Does anybody have any suggestions or comments on it? Any hams out there?</p><p>John</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorta but... not really. I&#039;m not wanting any sort of data or packet type repeater, more or less a &quot;remote base&quot; type of system. Where one talks into the system by some type of web interface (or another router/usb sound/walkie) on the internet end and it sends a push to talk and plain voice back into another walkie. Similar to the now-defunct Dingotel 2way FRS adapters, but not requiring a large computer.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>incognito53</strong> on 29 Mar 2009, 13:25)</p>

					<p>You might consider a packet radio device like those made by FreeWave.&nbsp; I was able to get a 900 MHz 56 kbps symmetric connection setup on WhiteRussian (see <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=15913)">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=15913)</a> without too much trouble.&nbsp; You would probably get better bitrates with such a device instead of a walkie-based setup.&nbsp; Ebay might have some of the older 33 kbaud devices for cheap.</p>									</div>
