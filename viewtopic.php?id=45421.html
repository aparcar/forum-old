					<p>Hello,</p><p>My goal is to setup OpenWrt+ LIRC + USB audio mic input + IR remote system.<br />I was following this FAQ: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/lirc-audio_alsa">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/lirc-audio_alsa</a></p><p>I&#039;ve two OpenWrt setups: one is OpenWrt (AA) x86 Virtualbox and second is OpenWrt (AA) on WR703N.<br />Both systems has the same ALSA, LIRC configuration files. </p><p>The same piece of hardware (IR receiver+USB audio) is working well on OpenWrt x86, and irexec proceeds commands well, but on OpenWrt WR703N is doesn&#039;t work:<br />- irw doesn&#039;t shows any messages coming<br />- irexec doesn&#039;t executes any commands<br />- BUT irrecord util is able to record signals from IR remote, and makes LIRC configuration file (which works on x86 btw)<br />- mode2 util also shows good signals coming from IR remote</p><p>Lircd log file doesn&#039;t shows any errors, or problems. Lirc is recompiled with alsa support.</p><p>OpenWrt on WR703N plays audio files well using this USB card. Alsamixer also shows this card as recognized.</p><p>Could you please help me to debug this situation? </p><p>Where to start?</p><p>The strange part is, that sometimes (after reboots, or after some time) irw&amp;irexec starts working well for several minutes, and then stops with no reason. No changes are done in configuration during that time...</p><p>Thanks,<br />Valentas</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />I think I know what your problem is. When I started trying to accomplish the same thing I spent like two days trying to figure out a solution. <br />I don&#039;t think this has nothing to do with the ar9331 problem.<br />So, good and bad news. Bad news: I still dont know what the causes are. Good news: If it&#039;s the same problem it&#039;s just a matter of running a script every time you reboot (which luckily in my case is when the AC power goes down or something like that). <br />As you said, the strange thing is that after you mess a little with lircd it works, but then somehow when you try to reproduce that you just can&#039;t. The only thing one can do then is try to find a way of improving chances.<br />In my case this was a call in rc.local to a script: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/ash

if [ &quot;$1&quot; == &quot;boot&quot; ]; then

for countv in 1 2; do
amixer sset Speaker &quot;0%,0%&quot;
killall lircd
mpc play
lircd -d plughw@8000 /etc/lirc/lircd.conf
irexec --daemon /etc/lirc/lircrc 
sleep 1
mpc stop
amixer sset Speaker &quot;68%,68%&quot;
sleep 1
done

else

amixer sset Speaker &quot;0%,0%&quot;
killall lircd
mpc play
lircd -d plughw@8000 /etc/lirc/lircd.conf
irexec --daemon /etc/lirc/lircrc 
sleep 1
mpc stop
amixer sset Speaker &quot;68%,68%&quot;

fi</code></pre></div><p> </p><p>Now I don&#039;t know why but I discovered that whenever you make mpd(already running and with an mp3 loaded at this point) silently play something the chances of getting lircd to work were a lot higher. I play-start_lirc-stop twice at boot and sometimes it works, but sometimes it doesn&#039;t so after it&#039;s done booting I ssh into the router and run the script(without the boot flag) and try if the remote works. If it doesn&#039;t I do it once more. <br />I have been using this trick for like two years now and I don&#039;t think I ever needed to run the script manually more than two or three times per boot. It usually works at boot time is what I&#039;m saying.<br />My thoughts on why this needs to be done is that the music player does something to the soundcard when playing music, that the lirc&#039;s alsa driver is missing. But it is just speculation because I don&#039;t have the knowledge to trace the error. <br />What baffles me is that sometimes it works at boot, sometimes you have to run the script once after boot and sometimes twice. When computers approach randomness I usually get scared. So there has to be some logical explanation, as with the Flite software.<br />Finally, I couldn&#039;t generate a usable configuration file using irrecord but luckily I found one that works on a web site. The only thing I had to correct is the aeps value (to 200) and that improved sensitivity a lot.<br />Let me know how it goes or if you find a better way of dealing with this issue.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, as I suspected. You have a wrong configuration option set. So, fixing the volume control is easy. <br />Having said that, if you have a similar USB sound card to the one I have you may have another problem with that configuration. With some mp3 files I used to hear like a metallic sound. So I recommend you to try something like:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>audio_output {
         type &quot;alsa&quot;
         name &quot;My ALSA Device&quot;
         mixer_control &quot;Speaker&quot; 
         device &quot;plughw:0,0&quot;  
} </code></pre></div><p>That is the one my sound card liked the most. Also, if I tried changing the resampling option it downgraded the quality. So keep the following options disabled and see how it goes:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#audio_output_format        &quot;48000:16:2&quot;
#samplerate_converter        &quot;internal&quot;</code></pre></div>									</div>
