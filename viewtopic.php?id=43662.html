					<p>In a sense, yes. </p><p>When you send a TCP/IP packet across a network that packet will be received by one or more devices (nodes or routers) which will then have to decide if they should re-transmit the packet and, if so, to which interface(s) should it be re-transmitted. In this way, your packet will move closer toward your intended recipient.</p><p>How do the intermediate devices determine if and how to re-transmit the packet? They look at the destination IP address in the packet header and compare it to the routes that it knows how to reach in its own route table. If it doesn&#039;t have a suitable route in the route table then it will drop the packet, but if it does have a suitable route then it will forward the packet to that route.</p><p>For a small, simple network, you could configure the route table of each network device by hand. However, as the network grows larger it will become burdensome to keep all the route tables up-to-date (especially if the physical topology changes frequently, eg devices appear, disappear, or change location). That&#039;s where a mesh routing protocol comes in. A mesh routing protocol allows the devices on your network to automatically discover their neighbors and propagate up-to-date route tables to all the devices on the network. Many routing protocols like OLSR operate userland services which send and process discovery packets on the network and then manage the routes in the local route table. BATMAN operates in a slightly different way but effects the same result.</p><p>Could you create a mesh network without using a mesh routing protocol? Technically yes, but managing the route tables does become onerous for medium to large networks.</p><p>Does a network such as the one you&#039;ve described constitute a mesh network? Generally when people speak of &#039;mesh networking&#039; there are some implied features or constraints. One of the biggest of which is the existence of redundant links which could provide an alternate route if one path in the network goes down. In your scenario you have four devices which are connected linearly with no redundancy, therefore it doesn&#039;t really satisfy the redundancy component of mesh networking.</p><p>Best of luck.</p>									</div>
