					<p>I am running Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 on TL-WDR3600. I have a 70 Mbps internet connection, and I see similar speed on my 5 Ghz wifi channel, but only about half on the 2.5 Ghz. I tried different channel/width values for the 2.5 Ghz wifi channel, but I still can&#039;t overcome the 40 Mbps barrier. Any tips please?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>samsingla</strong> on 11 Apr 2017, 15:51)</p>

I have a Galaxy S6 and I get 70 Mbps on it if I use the 5 Ghz channel, but &lt; 40 Mpbs if I use the 2.4 Ghz. Got similar results with my Desktop.

As you mentioned this is just the connection, the net download speed is considerable slower.
