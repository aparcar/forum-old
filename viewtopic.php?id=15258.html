					<p>Hi,</p><p>i use the official Kamikaze 7.09 Kernel 2.6 Image on a Netgear WGT634U.<br />When i try to open a slave pseudo tty (e.g. /dev/pts/3) which was previously<br />created by opening /dev/ptmx i get always a input/output error message.<br />In detail i try to create a AX25 kisslink from a program called XNET<br />and afterwards try to attach the Kernel AX25 by usage of kissattach.<br />If i try to open the /dev/ptmx with cat and afterwards try to echo some<br />characters into the corresponding slave device the write fails due to an error<br />opening the slave and also the ptmx side is closed.<br />On the other hand the pseudo tty system seems to work somehow because<br />there are already slave devices open after boot.</p><p>Hope someone has an idea. Thanks in advance.</p><p>Mario</p>									</div>
