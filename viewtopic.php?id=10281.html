					<p>Hello to everyone! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> As you can see, I&#039;m new and I&#039;m sure I would learn a lot here.<br />I&#039;m experiencing a problem with a friend&#039;s G604T. After it crashed to the ground, the wireless connection stopped working. He tried to get it work again with no success then gave it to me.<br />I opened it, desoldered the plate over the wireless card and found out that the mini-pci card (an Alpha Network WMP-G04 with TI TNETW1130GVF chipset) was a little dislocated. I put it in place and resoldered the plate but it didn&#039;t work: the wireless couldn&#039;t be started.<br />I&#039;m quite sure that the card could be damaged. Do you agree with me? Is there a way of interrogating the card by the Linux subsistem accessible by telnet? If I have to change the card, is it possible to replace it with a different card? I fear not because I think that somewhere in the router mtd3 there might be some drivers for it and this will lead to a lot of errors.<br />Alpha one isn&#039;t to be found anywhere, while I&#039;ve found a couple of TNETW1130GVF based cards. What do you think I should do?<br />Thanks for your replies! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
