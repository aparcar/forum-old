					<p>Dear all,</p><p>I&#039;m puzzled that after several hours of research, I still cannot get all details of what I need for proper German Telekom VDSL connections. More likely than not, I will switch to a <a href="https://www.telekom.de/privatkunden/zuhause/internet-und-fernsehen/magenta-zuhause-m">&quot;Magenta Zuhause M&quot;</a> contract (Telekom Germany), despite the fact that they don&#039;t support T.38 for fax over IP. Because generally I&#039;m a happy customer there, and we have access to slightly cheaper options as the contract is supported by my employer.<br />So what kind of hardware should I buy? I don&#039;t want a FritzBox if I can avoid it, and I want to restrict to as few devices as possible. Best option: One router with integrated modem, one VoIP DECT phone base station.</p><p>So far on the wishlist: The router/modem should have<br /></p><ol class="decimal"><li><p>VDSL2 support (necessary for Telekom VDSL50 and above?) and ADSL2+ support (just in case)</p></li><li><p>Annex B/J support</p></li><li><p>ITU-T G.993.5 support (should be required for bandwidths &gt; 16 Mbit/s, but I read other claims, too)</p></li><li><p>preferably OpenWRT support</p></li></ol><p>Also, I&#039;m unsure about whether additional capabilities are required to ensure QoS for phone calls from a VoIP PBX (thinking about something simple like a <a href="http://www.gigaset.com/en_HQ/shop/gigaset-c430-ip.html">Siemens Gigaset C430 IP</a>) connected to the router (VLAN tagging?), and if so, if they are de-facto standard for all newer models. Things used to be so simple a few years ago...</p><p>I had a look at TP-Link, Netgear, Linksys and D-Link devices. The closest match seems to be the <a href="http://www.tp-link.com.de/products/details/?categoryid=3788&amp;model=TD-W9980B">TP-Link TD-W9980B(DE)</a>, a.k.a. N600, which I guess will be OpenWRT-supported at some point in time, but it only has G.993.2, not G.993.5.<br />Also, I could not find separate VDSL2-Modems except full FritzBoxes which can be turned to pure modem mode.</p><p>So, is there really no way around FritzBoxes for the time being if I want to enjoy the 50 Mbit/s connections via Telekom VDSL?</p><p>(BTW: Our current phones are three standard analog phones plus analog fax, connected to an old ISDN PBX. AFAIU, all current routers with integrated PBX and TAE sockets or old-school a/b-connectors for plain old analog phones do not offer PBX functionality under OpenWRT? Also, are there affordable home-user router/PBX combos with more than two TAE sockets?)</p><br /><p>Thanks a lot in advance for your advise!<br />Alexander</p>									</div>

You will need a G.993.5 if you are on a vectoring Outdoor-MSAN, otherwise I believe DTAG will fall back to VDSL16 without vectoring, not too attractive. The TP-Link does not (yet?) support vectoring to my knowledge (which admittedly is limited). I do not know any other pure VDSL modem.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ADSL2+ and VDSL ITU standards use sequential letters to organize their annexes:</p><p>Annex J for ADSL2+ is a bandplan/profile that reuses the complete POTS/ISDN range for upload and can offer up to 2.8 Mbps uplink on a ADSL2+ link (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.992.3_Annex_J).">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.992.3_Annex_J).</a> </p><p>For VDSL2 Annex B is a collection of band plans and other technicalities in use in Region B (Europe) and Annex J is not yet assigned (as far as I know)</p><p>So for VDSL2 you need an Annex B VDSL2 modem and for decent ADSL2+ you need an Annex J ADSL2+ modem. This is a bit confusing, but also logical once one accepts that the annexes always reference a &quot;base document&quot;.</p><br /><div class="quotebox"><cite>perpeduumimmobile wrote:</cite><blockquote><div class="quotebox"><cite>moeller0 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Alternatively the speed port w723v type A can be almost used as&nbsp; VVDSL modem (almost: it insists on terminating the VLAN so this might not work with DT&#039;s IP-TV offer).

Anyway I do not own a friotzbox so can not really comment upon their security or lack thereof... I do note though that AVM offers several boxes that allow to plug in analog phones via a TAE-style socket and/or a RJ-45 S0-bus for ISDN devices; again no idea how well these work. I would assume that you have more control with setting up your own openwrt router, and more convenience by paying AVM to integrate all the components into a package, just decide what you value more <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>
