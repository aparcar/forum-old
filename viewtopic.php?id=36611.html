					<p>Hello,</p><p>&nbsp; I&#039;ve a WRT54GL acting as AP for my neighbours, connected on an external omnidirectional antenna.</p><p>I&#039;ve recently upgraded it from a OpenWRT 10.03 with brcm-2.4 image to a 10.03.1 with brcm47xx, and since then, almost all my neighbours lost their connection :-(</p><p>Investigating the problem, I wonder if antenna selection which was set before is still applied :<br />- using Luci, I can&#039;t set-up the antenna selection (there is no option offered)<br />- when manually setting&nbsp; options in /etc/config/wireless, it seems not modifying anything :</p><p>my previous /etc/config/wireless was like :</p><p>config &#039;wifi-device&#039; &#039;wl0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;type&#039; &#039;broadcom&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;channel&#039; &#039;6&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;txpower&#039; &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;txantenna&#039; &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;rxantenna&#039; &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;distance&#039; &#039;300&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;disabled&#039; &#039;0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;hwmode&#039; &#039;11g&#039;</p><p>config &#039;wifi-iface&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;device&#039; &#039;wl0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;network&#039; &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;mode&#039; &#039;ap&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ssid&#039; &#039;MY-SSID&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;encryption&#039; &#039;psk+psk2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;key&#039; &#039;MY-KEY&#039;</p><p>and using Luci, the new one is :</p><p>config &#039;wifi-device&#039; &#039;radio0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;type&#039; &#039;mac80211&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;macaddr&#039; &#039;00:1d:7e:bc:55:de&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;hwmode&#039; &#039;11g&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;channel&#039; &#039;6&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;country&#039; &#039;FR&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;distance&#039; &#039;300&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;txpower&#039; &#039;0&#039;</p><p>config &#039;wifi-iface&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;device&#039; &#039;radio0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;mode&#039; &#039;ap&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ssid&#039; &#039;MY-SSID&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;network&#039; &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;encryption&#039; &#039;psk-mixed&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;key&#039; &#039;MY-KEY&#039;</p><br /><p>I also tried to use &quot;iw&quot; to set up manually antenna selection :<br /># iw list |grep -i antenna<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Available Antennas: TX 0x3 RX 0x3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Configured Antennas: TX 0x1 RX 0x1<br /># iw phy phy0 set antenna 1 1<br />command failed: Operation not supported (-122)<br /># iw phy phy0 set antenna 0 0<br />command failed: Operation not supported (-122)<br /># iw phy phy0 set antenna all<br />command failed: Operation not supported (-122)</p><br /><p>&nbsp; I wonder if it&#039;s possible to select tx/rx antenna on WRT54GL with brcm47xx ?

					<p>The &quot;not supported&quot; error code is misleading. It actually means it does not support setting the antenna while the radio is up.<br />Use &quot;uci set wireless.radio0.txantenna=1/2/3; uci set wireless.radio0.rxantenna=1/2/3; wifi&quot; to try different antenna settings.</p><p>Oh, and your config is wrong. It should have type mac80211 when using brcm47xx - follow <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless#regenerate.configuration">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireles â€¦ figuration</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your clarification. I&#039;ve reverted to brcm-2.4 meanwhile, but I&#039;ll retest brcm47xx with your indications !</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve tested another time the brcm47xx image, using your indications, but without more success.<br />I tried the three possible valid values for rxantenna/txantenna : 1, 2 and 3 (which is I suppose the 1+2 antenna = diversity) :<br />with 2 setting, my far neighbours can&#039;t see my AP. With 1 and 3 setting,&nbsp; they can detect it, but with a so low S/N ratio (1 or 2 dB) that they can&#039;t associate/use them. I&#039;ve verified each time with &#039;iw list | grep -i ant&#039; that the antenna setting was changed, and wait a bit before to switch.<br />Another strange thing is that with brcm47xx image, the associated stations shown in the bottom of Luci&#039;s main status are with a very high noise floor, about 70dB, whereas with the brcm-2.4 image, it&#039;s about -94 dB ! Perhaps it&#039;s related ?</p><br /><p>About the config, I had already the &#039;mac80811&#039;&nbsp; type in my config (i called it the &#039;new one&#039; in my first post). I&#039;ve checked the wireless reconfiguration as you mentionned, but didn&#039;t find a difference with my config... but learnt some interesting other things about wireless config, as the way to avoid to put the MAC address in the config (using phy name instead) :-)</p><p>I&#039;m going back to brcm-2.4 for the moment. If you see what can be wrong, tell me please !</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks.</p>									</div>
