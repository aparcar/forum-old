There have been several improvements in the past few months. (The best would be a self-built version with all the improvements/fixes also realted to IPv6 even after rc4)</p><p>I have a static 6in4 tunnel from SixXS, but the config shouold be rather similar as with HE. Only the &#039;6in4&#039; package is needed and I have not even installed 6tunnel or 6scripts.</p><p>You might read this: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27541">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27541</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 12 Feb 2011, 18:05)</p>

					<p>I do have it working and serving IPv6 addresses to my LAN.&nbsp; As I had upgraded the image while telling Luci to keep my configuration, I found that the 6in4 package still wasn&#039;t available.&nbsp; Following the &quot;Edit package lists and installation targets&quot; link and changing the URL to the correct repository fixed that and I was off and running.&nbsp; It&#039;s likely that I do not need to firewall rule listed in the first post as I&#039;m using HE.net as my IPv6 broker but I added it for completeness.&nbsp; Also, I did not add any additional firewall rules as the default Incoming and Forward policies are Drop and Outgoing is Accept and Masq is enabled.&nbsp; I also followed some of the configuration details on the Wiki page for HE.net.</p><p>After setting up Radvd, my desktop is receiving its Global IPv6 address and everything &quot;just works&quot;.&nbsp; My laptop on wireless does not get a global IPv6 address, however.&nbsp; I think that is due to my AP being a WRT55AG even though it is functioning as a bridge and not a router.&nbsp; I would appreciate any insight into whether this is the case.&nbsp; In other words, the WRT55AG has a connection to the WL500GP via one of its switch ports and not the WAN port.&nbsp; This way all wireless devices are part of my main IPv4 private subnet.&nbsp; I suspect that the lack of IPv6 support in the WRT55AG is preventing my laptop from getting its IPv6.&nbsp; All my computers are running latest versions of Debian.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Nate</strong> on 13 Feb 2011, 16:25)</p>
