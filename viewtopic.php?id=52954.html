					<p>I just installed Openwrt Attitude Adjustment in a brand new v8.4 TP LINK tl-841N router. </p><p>Right now, I&#039;m facing three major problems which I&#039;m not able to solve. </p><p>1) The DNS entries are automatically populated to /tmp/resolv.conf.auto and dnsmasq is supposed to populate it&#039;s entries from this file. But, for some weird reason this is not happening. I tried various solution posted online, including restarting dnsmasq as root, but nothing worked. The only thing that seems to work, is to copy the entries from this file to /etc/resolv.conf. But, when I connect to a new network, I would have to repeat the whole process. </p><p>2) Even when DNS is working in the router (because of copying entries to /etc/resolv.conf), my computer which is connected to the router via the LAN port is not able to resolve DNS. In the computer&#039;s resolv.conf, the router&#039;s ip is given as the name server. Still, DNS is not working. </p><p>3) After about 10 minutes from starting the router, the WAN connection just hangs. The LAN is working perfectly, but any communication to the Internet becomes impossible. I try pinging to external IPs from the router and all the packets are dropped. To solve this, I have to restart the router. But after restarting, the same problem again happens within a few minutes. </p><p>All these problems make my router totally unstable now. It would be of great help if someone could suggest solutions for the above problems.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hashken</strong> on 26 Sep 2014, 19:38)</p>
