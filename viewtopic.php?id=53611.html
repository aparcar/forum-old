					<p>Hey there.</p><p>Could you please explain what particular problem you are up against? Imho it&#039;s at all the domian of DNS servers to skip a certain class of responses. So I really doubt there is a dnsmasq config option for this.</p><p>The first thing is: It&#039;s completely up to the client which records it is asking for.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>C:\Users\me&gt;nslookup -q=a google.de</p></blockquote></div><p>This is the client asking for all A records on windows.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>C:\Users\me&gt;nslookup -q=aaaa google.de</p></blockquote></div><p>This is the client asking for all AAAA records on windows.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>C:\Users\me&gt;nslookup -q=any google.de</p></blockquote></div><p>This is the client asking for each and every record the server knows.</p><p>If I was up to implementing such a thing, I would trat every class equally and not make any differences for certain classes as long as a class specification doesn&#039;t require one.<br />So if it was my implementation, having the DNS server skip AAAA out of the &quot;any&quot; query would *not* be done by &quot;remove the AAAA package&quot; but by &quot;make the server to be aware of differences between A and AAAA and skip AAAA if found&quot;.</p><p>The next thing is everything execpt A and AAAA records containing IPs as well.</p><p>Think about MX records. It&#039;s really unlikely, but as far as i know it&#039;s completely valid to make MX reords directly point to IP addresses instead of host names. <br />So you not only need a DNS server that is capalble of treating A and AAAA records differently but identify the payload of every record in order to decide if it&#039;s an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address or a host name.</p><p>Ontop of that you have e.g. spf data in TXT records.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>example.com. IN TXT &quot;v=spf1 ip4:192.0.2.0/24 ip4:198.51.100.123 a -all&quot;</p></blockquote></div><p>Here you not even require the DNS server to identify the payload of records but you also need to make the DNS server to be fully aware of every common format variant of those specific data types and allow the DNS server to recreate those records as IPv4 only.</p><p>And now you&#039;re in the domain of DNSSEC. As soon as you have client software that uses DNSSEC, skipping or recreating DNS data and skipping IPv4 is completely out of scope because you simply break functionality.</p><p>If I would implement e.g. &quot;OTA&quot; software distribution for mobile phones, or every other software distribution, that&#039;s at least what I would do:<br />* Hard code RESTy endpoints to ask for updates and receive update information.<br />* Secure the payload through valid certificates on my webservers.<br />* Secure the endpoint validation through valid DNSSEC.</p><p>So if I was a smartphone manufacturer, you would most likely break every chance of updating those.</p><p>And now the main thing: What&#039;s the use of it?</p><p>If your clients have no IPv6 connectivity. You simply reach that by not giving them IPv6 addresses expect the ones they make up out of link lokal (fe80::/10) and not announce any IPv6 router.</p><p>This will definitively force your clients to recognize the IPv6 responses as unreachable, drop them and use IPv4 instead.</p><p>There&#039;s only one situation where I would want to influence the IPv4/IPv6 intereatation: If I had different connection quality for IPv4 and IPv6, e.g. when my IPv6 is only realized through tunnel broakers and the broaker is far far away. Here I would want my clients to always use IPv4 if there is a IPv4 response and only fall back to IPv6 if no Ipv4 is available for a certain resource.<br />But that&#039;s clearly not your desire because you&#039;re asking for dropping IPv6 completely.</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>									</div>

My main problem is that the DNS relay gives out IPV6 solutions to querys preferentially, and that windows, and android try those IPV6 addresses, unfruitfully. </p><p>This results in pages not loading. Facebook for instance. </p><p>If i try Facebook.com in a recently booted PC, the page does not load, until i F5 it several times. Then, once the local cache (Of the PC), marks the V6 entry as unreachable and loads the V4 ones, facebook works as usual. </p><p>Then i try Google, and Google doesn&#039;t load, because it is ipv6 ready, and i have to masturbate the F5 button until it flags the V6 name as bad, and loads the v4 ones. </p><p>That&#039;s for Google</p><p>Addresses:&nbsp; 2800:3f0:4001:811::1003<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 173.194.118.39<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 173.194.118.46<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 173.194.118.36<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 173.194.118.37<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 173.194.118.32<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 173.194.118.33<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 173.194.118.41<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 173.194.118.40<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 173.194.118.35<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 173.194.118.34<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 173.194.118.38</p><br /><p>Sites that are NOT ipv6 ready, such as BBC.com, never have this problem, because there are no V6 addreses to try.</p><br /><p>So, how would i go about treating those unfortunate ipv6 addreses differently than the V4 ones? </p><p>There is a mechanism to make IPV4 be tried first every time, instead of V6?</p>									</div>
