Seems more like something causing DNS lookups to be slow at times. I can also watch messages in Chrome browser that show looking up host and then page loads. Again I do not see this behavior on DD-WRT. This is intermittent and most pages load fine for me, just the occasional one and may be a site I visited not that long ago, where the DNS cache should still have the contents.</p></blockquote></div><p>So from what you and 2 others recently posted, it affects @david&#039;s builds (built from development/trunk branch) and official LEDE 17.01.2 and it affects @beachbum&#039;s 1200AC V1.&nbsp; I also have a 1200AC V1, but have never encountered this issue.</p><p>I&#039;m assuming those that this affects is in the minority or there would be many more complaints.</p><p>Does DD-WRT use dnsmasq like LEDE?&nbsp; If so, what version does it use?&nbsp; Also, have you compared /etc/config/dhcp in LEDE vs in DD-WRT (assuming it exists in DD-WRT and uses dnsmasq -- not very familiar with DD-WRT, sorry)?</p><p>The main thing I don&#039;t understand is why this issue affects only a few.&nbsp; What OS are those of you with the issue running?&nbsp; Have you tried manually setting the DNS server from inside the OS (to bypass the router) and see if that fixes it?</p>									</div>

					<p>I have been running davidc502&#039;s snapshots on my wrt3200acm for about a month now. For the most part it has been stable. Lately, I&#039;ve had to reconnect the lan interface through Luci to get it to work. The weird part is that it seems to affect devices differently. I am unable to access the Luci Config Page from most machine (OSX, android, IOS), but was able to gain access through a wifi connected windows 10 machine. Directly connecting a machine to the router doesn&#039;t seem to make a difference. This happened at least 3 times since I upgraded 4 days ago. </p><p>Additionally, I somehow managed to flash both partitions with the latest version of LEDE. Is there a way to revert the current partition to the Factory image or to at least dd-wrt? </p><p>thanks</p>									</div>

When you flash from either OEM, Openwrt or LEDE, <strong>you always flash the other partition</strong>, so that the current one stays as the fallback option.

					<p>Hey all,</p><p>I&#039;m having some trouble with the firmware and I&#039;m hoping someone might be able to help me troubleshoot it. I recently purchased a WRT3200ACM. I originally installed the latest version of OpenWRT and then upgraded to Davidc502&#039;s firmware (the July 29th version). Everything was working fine, until I upgraded to the July 30 firmware. After that, I had no DNS resolution on my local network. The router can ping and access the Internet without a problem, but none of the machines on the LAN were able to resolve hosts.</p><p>Even downgrading back to the original OpenWRT firmware didn&#039;t fix the problem, so I re-flashed the stock firmware and everything was fine. I just tried flashing Davidc502&#039;s factory image from stock and ended up with the same problem. I did notice that my computer, which is connect directly to the router via an Ethernet cable, listed the DNS server as 192.168.1.14, even though the router&#039;s address is 192.168.1.1, but I&#039;m not sure how to get the router to give out the proper address. Does anyone have any idea how to fix this?</p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I tried setting&nbsp; &quot;option nonwildcard&nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;0&#039;&quot; in /etc/config/dhcp and setting custom DNS servers for the LAN interface, but it did not fix the issue.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>access</strong> on 7 Aug 2017, 00:05)</p>
