					<p>I have a Fonera 2100 with DD-WRT v24-sp2 (03/25/13) std (SVN revision 21061). I know it is an OpenWRT forum but I hope you will understand that I could also switch to openwrt very easily if this could solve my problem. Furthermore, I did not get any reply in the DD-WRT board. </p><p>Returning to my problem, the Fonera successfully connects to a modem/router via wi-fi (the modem/router has wpa2 password). Then the Fonera repeates that signal with another wifi essid. Therefore, I had to create a wifi virtual interface in order to so.</p><p>Everything works fine, even though the performance are not great but I can understand since the single antenna of the Fonera has to receive the signal and then transmit.</p><p>Now, the Fonera has also an ethernet port. I would like to use that ethernet port and connect a device. This device should receive the &quot;internet&quot; which arrives from the wifi signal of the modem/router.</p><p>Right now, if I connect a laptop via ethernet to the Fonera it does not connect to the internet and presents another class of IPs.</p><p>Do you know if it is possible to achieve what I want? Why the ethernet port seems &quot;disabled&quot;?</p><p>I hope I was clear.</p>									</div>

					<p>The troughput on the fonera 2100 is pretty bad period, so don&#039;t get your hopes up by using the ethernet port for substantial better connectivity.</p><p>But my guess would be at this point, that the ethernet port currently is deignated as wan, and you can just plug that into your modem/internet and it should work. (but no gurantees because I don&#039;t do much with dd-wrt)</p><p>But if you have openwrt on the device, the ethernet port would default to lan, but you can then change it to wan fairly easy via the web gui, or via cli.</p>									</div>
