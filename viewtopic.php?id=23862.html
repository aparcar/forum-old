					<p>Hi all!</p><p>I&#039;ve spent some hours in last days on Google and forum Search, but no success till now.<br />Any help on this is greatly appreciated!&nbsp; Bellow you can find all details.</p><p><strong>Problem:</strong> can not register SIP softphone/device from web (WAN). I only get timeout. Same softphone/device works 100% ok when within LAN.</p><p><strong>Environment:</strong><br />Fonera is main router and also the Asterisk server:<br /> - Kamikaze v8.09.2 (in fact Gargoyle v1.1.7)<br /> - embedded Asterisk v1.4.23.1 (asterisk14-mini package installed via opkg)<br />Fonera is pluged to a cable modem (WebSTAR DPC2100R2)<br />Dynamic IP<br />Fonera DDNS is pointing to xxxx.no-ip.org<br />PC/ATA/smartphone on LAN via WiFi to Fonera/Asterisk<br />Asterisk registered ok to some SIP providers.</p><p><strong>Fonera Firewall:</strong><br />UDP 4569&nbsp; &nbsp; forwarded to 192.168.1.1<br />UDP 5036&nbsp; &nbsp; forwarded to 192.168.1.1<br />UDP 3478&nbsp; &nbsp; forwarded to 192.168.1.1<br />UDP&nbsp; &nbsp; 8000~8050 forwarded to 192.168.1.1 (all SIP clients are set to use 8000~8050 RTP)<br />UDP/TCP 5060~5065 forwarded to 192.168.1.1 (all SIP clients are set to use 5060~5065 SIP)<br />(also tried DMZ to 192.168.1.1 but did not help)</p><p><strong>asterisk.conf</strong><br />[options]<br />languageprefix = yes<br />systemname = xxxx.no-ip.org</p><p><strong>rtp.conf</strong><br />[general]<br />rtpstart=8000<br />rtpend=8050</p><p><strong>sip.conf</strong><br />[general]<br />context=XXXX<br />externhost=xxxx.no-ip.org<br />externrefresh=60<br />localnet=192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0<br />port=5060<br />bindaddr=0.0.0.0&nbsp; <br />useragent=xxxx.no-ip.org<br />realm=xxxx.no-ip.org<br />srvlookup=yes&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />defaultexpiry=1800<br />nat=yes<br />canreinvite=no<br />qualify=yes<br />insecure=port,invite<br />disallow=all<br />allow=ulaw<br />allow=gsm<br />dtmfmode=auto<br />rtptimeout=120<br />rtpholdtimeout=300</p><p>[500]<br />type=friend<br />context=YYYY<br />username=500<br />secret=xxxxx<br />callerid=(&quot;Wilson Cel&quot; &lt;500&gt;)<br />host=dynamic</p><p><strong>SIP clients on LAN:</strong><br />eyeBeam, ATA and Nokia smartphone can register to Asterisk with no problem.<br />All are configured to register to xxxx.no-ip.org (not to LAN IP 192.168.1.1)<br />Can call and receive calls ok.&nbsp; Even no audio problems.</p><p><strong>SIP clients from Web:</strong><br />eyeBeam and Nokia smartphone can not even register to Asterisk.&nbsp; Only gets timeout.<br />All them are configured to register to xxxx.no-ip.org<br />Have tried with and without STUN server configured on them.</p><p>In Fonera, if I don&#039;t forward ports and/or don&#039;t DMZ 192.168.1.1 registration is refused almost instantly.&nbsp; So when forwarding and/or DMZing seems some communication is started between clients/Fonera because it takes almost a minute to get timeout.</p><p>Just as additional info: all SIP clients can register and works fine with other hosted SIP PBXs (SipSorcery, Voxalot, PBXes), so it is not restrictions on clients&#039; LAN/WAN.&nbsp; Problem for sure is in my OpenWrt+Asterisk</p><br /><p>Any tips?<br />Can you register your SIP clients to your embedded Asterik?&nbsp; If so, how are your Asterisk conf files?&nbsp; How is your OpenWrt firewall config?</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wilsonhlacerda</strong> on 8 Mar 2010, 23:45)</p>

					<p>Solved!&nbsp; But.....<strong>I think I found a bug in Gargoyle/OpenWrt!</strong><br />Is REDIRECT broken????</p><br /><p>As written above I forward all ports using Gargoyle GUI.<br />If I go to \etc\config\firewall I can see REDIRECTs like this one:<br /><em><br />config &#039;redirect&#039; &#039;redirect_enabled_number_1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;name&#039; &#039;SIP&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;src&#039; &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;dest&#039; &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;udp&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;src_dport&#039; &#039;5060-5065&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;dest_port&#039; &#039;5060-5065&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;dest_ip&#039; &#039;192.168.1.1&#039;</em></p><p>This is expected to:<br />1- WAN accept inbound on ports 5060~5065<br />2- forward everything to LAN 192.168.1.1 ports 5060~5065</p><p>But sure this is not happening, otherwise Asterisk could register the SIP clients.</p><p>So I just added to \etc\config\firewall RULEs like this:</p><p>config &#039;rule&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;src&#039; &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;udp&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;dest_port&#039; &#039;5060-5065&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;target&#039; &#039;ACCEPT&#039;</p><p>And bingo!&nbsp; Everything works just perfect!</p><p>So....seems that Gargoyle/OpenWrt REDIRECT itself is not enabling WAN inbound.&nbsp; We do have to explicit ACCEPT inbound on desired port ranges.&nbsp; In my point of view this is clearly a bug in the firewall.</p><p>And for my specific case, as I endup having to add the RULES, I then just deleted the port forwards.&nbsp; &#039;Cause with the RULEs now Asterisk can interface to the outside directly through WAN side.</p><p>Hope this can help other people running Asterisk or other kind of server in the router.</p><p>And also help developers in fixing this REDIRECT bug.</p>									</div>

					<p>If your FON has a public IP Address, I reckon you should use <strong>localnet=&lt;the public IP Address&gt;</strong>. If the public IP Address is on a subnet A, B, or C, then use <strong>localnet=&lt;the public IP Address&gt;/8</strong>, <strong>localnet=&lt;the public IP Address&gt;/16</strong>, or <strong>localnet=&lt;the public IP Address&gt;/24</strong>, respectively. The configurations for your extension phones should use <strong>nat=yes</strong> if they are behind your FON device with a private IP Address. On this architecture, you can configure your asterisk with a <strong>canreinvite=yes</strong>, too. This way, your FON device won&#039;t waste its CPU resources for asterisk o control the RTP traffics.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mazilo</strong> on 10 Mar 2010, 14:57)</p>

					<p>AFAIK, so long as no transcoding is involved, Asterisk could care less what CoDec is used by the clients. For instance, my Asterisk PBX system doesn&#039;t have a G729 CoDec, yet I have configured my Asterisk PBX system + all ATA devices to use G729 as their primary CoDec and they all work just fine.</p>									</div>
