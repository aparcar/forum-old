					<p>Dumb question time, I&#039;m afraid. I&#039;ve just spent a couple of hours this morning scouring Google and these forums, trying to work out how to turn on ICMP ECHO responses (WAN ping) on my router&#039;s WAN interface, and I&#039;m well and truly stumped.</p><p>My router is running Attitude Adjustment 12.09 with LuCI 0.11.1</p><p>I don&#039;t remember ever selecting an option to disable WAN ping responses when configuring the router for my ISP. If I ever did select such an option, I&#039;ve not only forgotten doing so but I also can&#039;t find the option again to change it.</p><p>Is there an option in LuCI for enabling/disabling WAN ping responses? Do I need to type something on the router&#039;s SSH CLI?</p>									</div>

					<p>That&#039;d be why. Thanks for the pointer. That rule doesn&#039;t exist in /etc/config/firewall on my router. Not sure why; I don&#039;t remember deleting it. But at least now I know what to add.</p>									</div>
