					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am currently running backfire 10.03.1rc5 in my main router (an alix board). </p><p>I have a captive portal using the nodogsplash package to share 3mbps/200kbps with my neighbours using the nodogsplash capabilities to limit the bandwidth usage (the bandwidth limitation feature depend on the package iptables-mod-imq). It has been working like a charm for near 2 years.</p><p>As I have some spare time now I was planning to upgrade to attitude ajustment just to take a look at the new release but I have seen that the package iptables-mod-imq is no longer available in attitude ajustment so I suppose I canÂ´t limit the bandwidth usage in the captive portal if I use nodogsplash.</p><p>does anyone knows if there is any way to configure a captive portal in aptitude ajustment with download/upload bandwidth limitation? or any way to get iptables-mod-imq working in attitude ajustment so I can continue using nodogsplash?</p><p>thanks in advance for any suggestion.</p>									</div>

					<p>to get nodogsplash working in backfire with bandwidth limitation you should read this wiki entry:<br/><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/wireless.hotspot.nodogsplash">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/wireless.hotspot.nodogsplash</a></p><p>I think you are missing these two packages:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>opkg install ip
opkg install tc</code></pre></div><p>You should also check if you have edited the file /etc/init.d/nodogsplash and uncommented the last three lines. You have more detailed info in the wiki entry.</p><p>In attitude ajustment you won&#039;t get bandwidth limitation with just nodogsplash because package iptables-mod-imq is not available.&nbsp; I think the easier approach for a public hot-spot with bandwidth limitation in attitude ajustment would be to use nodogsplash+wondershapper with a config like this in /etc/config/wshaper. ( thanks for the people at openwrt-user mailing list for the suggestion)</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wshaper &#039;settings&#039;
        option network &#039;pubwifi&#039;
        option uplink &#039;160&#039;
        option downlink &#039;40&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Another option is to use coovachilli but that depends in an external radius server and is more complex. I think there is some option in coovachilli to work without a radius server but I haven&#039;t tried it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>esplinter</strong> on 30 Apr 2013, 14:01)</p>
