So for LAN interfaces one needs to invert the &quot;meaning&quot; of the up- and download fields in the GUI. You can easily instantiate multiple concurrent SQM instances (on different interfaces). Please report back whether things work now.</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>

Nah, asking is fine; after the fact the rationale is clear ( I hope) but the GUI does (for lack of space) not do a good job explaining these subtleties.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>pocha wrote:</cite><blockquote><p> I have tried both on eth0 &amp; br-lan interface &amp; I see similar behavior in ping time as I put SQM on one of the wan (&amp; keep other disconnected).</p></blockquote></div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So SQM on br-lan will probably also account pure internal traffic against the specified bandwidth limit, which for most people is somewhat unexpected...<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>pocha wrote:</cite><blockquote><p> There is a small glitch though.

I had a similar situation just recently, when I switched to a nominal 50/10 Mbps VDLS2 link; it turned out my ISP already shapes the 51/10 sync of the modem to 48/9.5 at his BRAS, once I lowered my egress shaper from 10 to 9.5 things statred to look more reasonable. In other words, please try to lower the shaper rates to 50% of the nominal values, see whether the phenomenon is still there, if not slowly ramp up first the egress until latency under load starts to increase again (pick the highest rate with acceptable latency under load for your taste) then do the same for ingress. Ideally use flent to measure the bufferbloat/latency under load increase while saturating both up- and downlink simultaneously.</p><br /><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;M.</p>									</div>
