					<p>Still using an old Linksys WRT54G as the gateway/router for my wired/wifi network. Cable TV co. supplies my internet connection. The thing handles firewalling, DHCP serving for both wired and wifi networks, as well as authenticating with my ISP and functioning as a gateway.</p><p>The network has been working ok although it is limited to 802.11g. Plus I would like to have some extra wired ports. Since I&#039;m fiddling with IPTV stuff these days, bringing in video over the g bandwidth might be a bit inadequate. So I&#039;m thinking of doing an upgrade/update to major parts of the network.</p><p>I&#039;ve looked at wifi routers that have 8 wired ports but there&#039;s not much out there for the budget-conscious. Plus, I would prefer running custom firmware such as openwrt. I do have many DD-WRT installs under my belt and a few openwrt ones, so I have a decent basis in the process and procedures involved. But my main question here will be about hardware.</p><p>I recently installed openwrt for someone on a Nexx3020. I&#039;m familiar with its specs and capabilities and am wondering whether one of those might be fruitfully pressed into service for my network upgrade/update. Could I expect this little device to do much the same thing as my WRT54G has been doing? Anyway, here&#039;s one possible scenario using that piece of equipment.</p><p>I&#039;ve found an 8-port fast ethernet switch that has good reviews and an unbeleivably low price. If I were to get a Nexx and install openwrt to it, could I then use the Nexx to act as a firewall/gateway, authenticating with my cable provider, and as a router for both wired and wifi networks? I would obviously be hooking its WAN port to my cable modem, and hooking the LAN port to the uplink jack on the aforementioned switch. That way I&#039;d have 7 open wired ports, instead of the 4 I&#039;m now limited to. Would that be over-taxing the thing?</p><p>I live in a smallish apartment, by the way, so I wouldn&#039;t expect the more limited wifi range of the Nexx, with its internal antennas, to be a problem. And I would have better wifi speed being on the N band. I know the ethernet ports on the Nexx are limited to 10/100 speed (as would be the inexpensive switch referenced). And although machines on my LAN are gigabit-ready, I don&#039;t expect my internet connection speed to exceed 100 mbps anytime in the near future. So being limited to fast ethernet on my WAN/LAN should not prove problematic.</p><p>In any case, I&#039;m up for input of any kind. Criticisms of my approach, suggestions for alternate equipment, corrections of misconceptions--feel free to offer it here.</p><p>A few additional details: There will actually be 2 video streamers on my LAN since I share my internet connection with a neighbor. Think something along the lines of netflix, possibly being streamed by us both simultaneously. 6-7 devices might be on the LAN at any given time. Occassional copying of larger files (1-2GB maximum on rare occassions) between hosts. So far the 10/100 speed limit has not proved much of a problem. Total costs for this project as laid out could be as low $25US according to research I&#039;ve done over the last day or two.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, apologies if I&#039;ve strained anyone&#039;s reading-comprehension abilities with those 563 words <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />. But there was an important question embedded in there--namely whether the Nexx wt3020 is sufficiently robust to handle the needs of a sometimes-demanding home LAN. Anyone have feedback on that question?</p><p>As far as price is concerned, the set-up I&#039;ve described is attractive in that regard; but it obviously won&#039;t have been a worthwhile expenditure if important elements like the Nexx turn out to be unable to handle the demand or if they will give out prematurely (overheating, perhaps?). It will prove to have been more expendient to have spent more on that element and to get something more robust. Which leads to the next logical possible form of input I am aiming to solicit--suggestions for alternate hardware. For example I&#039;ve run across the GLI GL-AR300M at about 3 times the cost (when shipping charges are factored in) for the Nexx. Perhaps that might be a better choice for the scheme under consideration?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wayover13</strong> on 29 Dec 2016, 18:46)</p>

					<p>I&#039;ll suggest you want to by a router other than the NEXX just because it only has 8MB of flash.&nbsp; While it will support current OpenWrt and LEDE images it&#039;s considered on the small side, especially if you load packages.&nbsp; Look for 16\64.</p><p>I run a PC-Engines 10/100 device with GB switches (Netgear) and have great LAN speeds, so that&#039;s no issue.&nbsp; </p><p>Hard to say how well the wireless will handle 2 concurrent video streams.</p>									</div>

					<p>You can buy a mini Nexx for like $12 on AliExp. Just buy it and try it. Don&#039;t get me wrong, 54G is a classic, but if life has been good with that you really don&#039;t need to worry about what router you&#039;re getting unless you are looking for cutting edge of wireless range and speed. You can get 4 port switches for like $5 each also. But why screw around with mini routers if you&#039;re even the slightest concerned about performance under demanding situations... just invest $75 on something that will keep you going for another 10 years and add switches as needed. Or keep your 54G and just buy a wireless N AP and add a switch to the 54G to get you your 8 ports you want.</p>									</div>
