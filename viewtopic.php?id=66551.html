					<p>Hi everybody, and thank you for accepting me on this forum <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p><p>My problem is that i have a D-LINK Dir 600 B6 modem/router and with the original firmware, i was unable to connect to the internet (pppoe) because i wasn&#039;t able to set my ISP&nbsp; VPI/VCI which are 0/38.</p><p>Now i successfully flashed it with openwrt thanks to this topic <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=49396&amp;p=2">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php â€¦ 96&amp;p=2</a></p><p>Actually i&#039;m with the openwrt-ramips-rt305x-dir-610-a1-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin</p><p>I set all the settings, but now the problem is that i don&#039;t have any adsl synchronization: I can set pppoe, my username/pass, vpi/vci, but i cannot find any&nbsp; place where i can see if my adsl line is synchronised or not. I think that the adsl driver of my Dlink dir-600 is not installed with openwrt. I tried to install it but i didn&#039;t find any adsl drivers that matchs with my dlink dir 600. </p><p>PS: My adsl line also didn&#039;t synchonized with the original firmware.</p><p>It&#039;s been 2 days of intensive search but now i&#039;m absolutely stunned. </p><p>Any help would be awesome !! Again thank you very much for your help !!! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
