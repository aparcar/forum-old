					<p>Hi,</p><p>We&#039;re on the same boat.&nbsp; After struggling a lot myself, managed to build image after following your thread <br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=32229">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=32229</a>. Thanks for it.</p><br /><br /><p>My intention was to run freeswitch with conference on the router. But somehow the freeswitch hang when I run it on the router. Any experience running freeswitch on this router?</p><p>Actually was thinking to dump this router for D-Link 825 as there is no news on backfire for nh2. But not sure with D-link also I&#039;ll end with the same problem on freeswitch.</p><p>Any advice?</p>									</div>
