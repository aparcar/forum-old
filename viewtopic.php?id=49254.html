					<p>i have a TP Link TL-MR3020, and installed OpenWRT.<br />1. I want to use the router to connect to other wireless network and other clients can connect to it.<br />2. The wireless connection i connect uses captive portal,Is it possible to setup the router to auto autheticate username and password for the wifi i connect to so that the clients connecting to MR3020 will not be prompted for authentication when using the internet</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, 1 &amp; 2 are possible. For 2 I would write a script which authenticate to the hotspot. Once you are connected to the Hotspot via another wireless interface (in sta mode) you can share the connection over the other wireless interface (in ap mode).<br /><a href="https://github.com/yath/hotspot/blob/master/hotspot.sh">Here</a> is such a script which e.g. authenticates to the Telekom Hotspot system (from german Telekom).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>written_direcon</strong> on 27 Feb 2014, 18:03)</p>
