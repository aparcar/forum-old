					<p>Hey guys.</p><p>I tried to run OpenWRT on my TP-Link TL-WR1043ND for several days without any success (it wasn&#039;t really stable). Today, after installing luci-proto-core and defining a new WAN interface, I wasn&#039;t able to access LuCI and the CLI after reboot any more (but the switching device of my router still works)</p><p>Any suggestion?</p><p>Best regards, Stew<br />(please excuse bad spelling/grammar <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />)</p><p>EDIT: Just found out that the DHCP also doesn&#039;t work.</p><p>EDIT2: Well, I can&#039;t tell you why but I&#039;am able to access LuCI when I&#039;m connected via WLAN. It looks like only the ethernet ports are dead. I realy don&#039;t know what caused this problem. Thanks anyway <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>steward</strong> on 17 Apr 2012, 13:24)</p>

					<p>You have only installed luci-proto-core, of course you cannot access the luci webui.<br />Just like, you want to install Win7 to your PC, but you&#039;ve just put win.exe to your hdd, of course your windows won&#039;t bootup can&#039;t start.<br />Luci work with tens of modules, and of course you Don&#039;t need to install them one by one.</p><p>BTW, Did you study the wiki ?</p>									</div>

					<p>My LuCi was running already, but I crashed it and also my SSH Access. Later I tried it via my Notebook (WLAN, not RJ45) an there it worked. Anyway, I just reset the OpenWRT firmware to the defaults and all works fine again. </p><p>Thanks for your answer.</p>									</div>
