					<p>I have a router running 15.05, and want to upgrade to 15.05.1; this device is configured to mount an external USB memory as extroot, and there are a bunch of packages and configuration files on the external device.</p><p>What is the recommended upgrade procedure in this case?

					<p>As someone with the <em>pivot overlay</em> type of ExtRoot - I can say, it is doable.</p><p>The only caveat is:<br /></p><ul><li><p>your settings will be saved to the tar.gz archive from the whole system - including the overlayed part of the file system</p></li></ul><p>This means that after the sysupgrade you&#039;ll finish with the squashfs partition with your full set of the settings (i.e., including the settings of the software not present in the bootable partition - which was installed only on the overlayed space).</p><p>For me - it is OK, I have almost the same settings in the bootable partition and on the overlayed space.<br />But if you have different, say, /etc/config/fstab here and over there - your overlay may not automount - no big deal, though. Just restore your boot partiton /etc/config/fstab file as it was before the sysupgade. Or have it (fstab contents) the same in the bootble and on the overlay.<br />No need to re-do all the pivot overlay procedure again.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>booBot</strong> on 19 May 2016, 20:01)</p>

					<p>I just upgraded from OpenWRT 14.x to LEDE 17.x via sysupgrade image.<br />I decided to upgrade, then clean-up the extroot.</p><p>When I upgraded the external drive was not mounted due to lack of necessary kernel modules and utilities. Then I went through extroot setup instructions and just removed all files from the mount point as an additional step. I actually didn&#039;t need to fix fstab or any other config. To recap:<br />* upgrade without giving a sh*t about extroot<br />* install extroot required packages<br />* remove all files from device<br />* copy overlay files per extroot docs<br />* reboot</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>avalon</strong> on 11 Nov 2017, 17:34)</p>
