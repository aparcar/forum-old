					<p>I&#039;m discussing with a programming partner of mine building a crude website that would let you build custom firmware images and download them.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also got server resources and some bandwidth to offer.</p><p>The main desire is to avoid having to use package manager and to get people testing the newer Trunks on the 802.11N platforms routers.</p><p>My early thoughts are for version 1.0 is to frontend the normal make menuconfig system with a web form something like:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Pick Target System: [Atheros AR71xx/AR913x (2.6)]
Pick Target Profile: [TRENDNet TEW-652BRP]

Modules you want added: [ kmod-ipv6 kmod-ip6tables ip6tables-utils kmod-ip6-tunnel kmod-iptunnel4 kmod-iptunnel6 ]</code></pre></div><p>some key design aspects to work out:</p><p>1) The system would come up with a unique identifier for each:&nbsp; SVN_version + target_system + target_profile + module_list&nbsp; .&nbsp; Such an identifier would be used to name the output file and present description of the build.<br />2) All requests would go into a queue and generate one at a time.&nbsp; It isn&#039;t like OpenWrt is _that busy_ at this point <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />3) Every 24 hours the build tree is deleted and fresh checkout from SVN on latest Trunk</p><p>Obviously this could evolve... but I would rather get something primitive up than overperfect it.<br />The overall goal is to make it similar to the normal make menuconfig system so that user can transition their experience with a particular combination of packages to their own local system.</p>									</div>

Windows users can use Virtualbox and install a linux. It&#039;s very easy to do this. And it would probably be a security issue for the server administrator if anyone could execute their own makefiles on the machine.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>CyrusFF</strong> on 3 Mar 2009, 21:59)</p>

					<p>yes, but for example: Mac users cannot compile samba3 and numerous of other packages <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /></p><p>but yes - you are correct: it would be too high risk on security..</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jake1981</strong> on 3 Mar 2009, 23:12)</p>

					<p>If you want to work with the image builder instead of compiling stuff, you might want to look into forward porting my old web image builder, which did<br />something very close to what you&#039;re proposing.

					<p>Great Idea.<br />I had posted a request for something like this a few weeks ago since I was hoping to avoid buying a new powerful PC just to speed up trunk builds. </p><p>Apart from the latest snapshot, it would be good to also have the latest release candidate (8.09 at this time) always available to build. </p><br /><br /><p>Original posting at <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=18383">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=18383</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; repeated below </p><p>My 2 year old 1.8 GHz laptop takes almost an hour to do a new buildroot. <br />Its a shame that I have to get a new desktp and cause all that waste for just reducing buildroot times.<br />Dedicated hosted servers are pretty expensive ($50/month) and they don&#039;t really save any energy or other resources<br />I don&#039;t think any of the standard shared hosting providers will allow you to add all the development packages need for buildroot (even if they do allow ssh access)</p><p>It would be nice if any of the Openwrt users/developers could come up with a shared build server for approved forum members to do their builds.<br />I think if someone moderated requests and put a min threshold of x postings on the forum, you could&nbsp; <br />Not sure if this is just a pipe dream or if there are other inexpensive ways to accomplish the same. ...</p>									</div>
