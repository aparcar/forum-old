					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have tested VPN pass through functionality in CD router and found the following testcase is failed <br />cdrouter_ipsecpt_110 </p><p>When analyzed the issues, I found the issues is the gateway is sending the IPSec ESP packet with invalid SPI. </p><p>In the test, CD router Simulates 2 LAN Devices on LAN port and try to setup vpn session to VPN server on the WAN side on both the clients. </p><p>We found Both the clients are sending IPSec package with unique SPI, But the gateway is not forwarding the packages correctly.</p><p>for the first client packet, the SPI is correct and forwarding the packet to VPN server on the WAN side. <br />But for the second client, the GW is changing the SPI as first one and forwarding the packet to VPN server. So the VPN server rejects the duplicate IPSec package from different client as there is already one client registered with same SPI.</p><p>Could anyone help me to how to debug this issue?</p>									</div>
