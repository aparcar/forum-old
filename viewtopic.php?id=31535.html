					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;m hoping someone can help properly configure my setup. I have a WRT54G v2.0 flashed with the latest OpenWrt backfire (10.03.1-rc5). I have been using the LuCI web interface to configure my setup. I unbridged the WAN/LAN interfaces, and enabled the wifi in client mode. I can successfully connect to a wireless network with WPA2-PSK encryption, however when I try to connect to a wireless network with WPA2-EAS TLS encryption it does not work.</p><p>I have a valid certificate for the network I&#039;m trying to connect to, which I downloaded to my local machine (netcert.p12). The certificate came in .p12 format, and I have the password. I am unsure how I am supposed to properly setup the certificate for use with my WRT54G/OpenWrt configuration. The LuCI interface asks for the &#039;Path to CA-Certificate&#039; and &#039;Path to Private Key&#039; and &#039;Password of Private Key&#039;.</p><p>I have seen some instructions for extracting the certificate and key which I tried to follow, namely:</p><p>openssl pkcs12 -clcerts -nokeys -in netcert.p12 -out cacert.pem<br />openssl pkcs12 -nocerts -in netcert.p12 -out key.pem<br />*(the 2nd command here asks me to set a password for the key.pem, which let&#039;s say I set as &#039;password&#039;)</p><p>I then go to the LuCI interface, and after inputting the basic network settings I direct to the &#039;Network&#039; -&gt; &#039;Wifi&#039; -&gt; &#039;Wireless Security&#039; tab, upload the two files I just generated, and use &#039;password&#039; as the &#039;Password of Private Key&#039;. However no luck in connecting. Am I generating the .pem files incorrectly? Is there some other step I&#039;m missing here? I have seen some references to OpenVPN but unsure if I need this or not.</p><p>Any help is appreciated! Thanks!</p>									</div>
