In fact, I will transfer LAN port 1 to WAN2 and then installed mwan3 after. So the presence of switch tab is a must.</p><p>In my previous WNDRMACv2 flashed with OpenWrt BB, the /etc/config/network looks like following and it works perfectly:</p><p>...<br />config switch<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option name &#039;switch0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option reset &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option enable_vlan &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option blinkrate &#039;2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option enable_vlan4k &#039;1&#039;</p><p>config switch_vlan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;switch0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ports &#039;0 1 2 5t&#039;</p><p>config switch_port<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;switch0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option port &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option led &#039;6&#039;</p><p>config switch_port<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;switch0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option port &#039;2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option led &#039;9&#039;</p><p>config switch_port<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;switch0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option port &#039;5&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option led &#039;2&#039;</p><p>config switch_vlan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;switch0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan &#039;2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ports &#039;3 5t&#039;<br />...</p><p>So port 5, the CPU, is tagged in both Vlan1 and Vlan2. I copy-paste switch_vlan part onto my WRT1200AC&#039;s config file and it bricked. So what will be the exact configuration for the WRT1200AC, should CPU also be tagged? (port 5 on WRT1200AC seems CPU also, and don&#039;t know what&#039;s about port 6). Thanks a lot in advance!</p>									</div>
