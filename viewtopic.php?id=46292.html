					<p><strong>This is the factory default</strong> (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300">ver 1.6</a>):<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/YFpy7PM.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/YFpy7PM.jpg" /></span></p><p><strong>After the mod</strong>:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/T1m7x0h.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/T1m7x0h.jpg" /></span></p><p>It&#039;s possible to do this mod if you have the skills to work with very small SMD parts and very specific &#039;ESD SAFE&#039; tools, a word of advice, this is not an easy task. You&#039;ll need:</p><p>1. A SMD rework system like the <a href="http://www.hakko.com/english/products/hakko_851_set.html">Hakko 851</a><br />2. Soldering iron<br />3. Desoldering tool, I used <a href="http://www.hakko.com/english/products/hakko_808.html">Hakko 808</a><br />4. Lead-free solder and Flux<br />5. A good set of Assembly Tweezers, I use a TEUBER SM109-SA.<br />6. 20x 21mm Loupe Magnifier.<br />7. A grounded Antistatic wrist strap.<br />8. White/Transparent/Clean liquid flux (not the yellow one!)<br />9. Isopropyl alcohol</p><p>The board uses 0603 led&#039;s with <strong>1.6 mm × 0.8 mm</strong>, they are very small.<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JtDTikc.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/JtDTikc.jpg" /></span></p><p>A plus (+) sign at the board indicates the LED Anode, an SMD LED has a green mark indicating the Cathode side, please <a href="http://lighthouseleds.com/blog/polarity-guide-of-0402-0603-0805-1206-and-most-all-smd-leds.html">check this guide</a> for reference. <strong>DO NOT REVERSE THE POLARITY OF THIS COMPONENT, EVER!</strong> or you&#039;ll do a permanent damage&nbsp; to the led it self and to the router board, you kill the led port and it won&#039;t lit anymore.</p><p>After you <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300">disassemble the router</a> remove the board from the bottom case and use the SMD rework station to desolder the led&#039;s you want to change, set the air flow to 4.5 and temperature to 300ºC (3), do not go over 300ºC, if you do the board will burn out. Pay special attention to the air flow pressure, otherwise you will blow the components near the tip away.</p><p>Clean the area with the desoldering tool and a desoldering wire/wick if necessary and check with the loupe magnifier.<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/lWYfRhM.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/lWYfRhM.jpg" /></span></p><p>Put solder on the right side of the pad, just enough to cover it. Grab the led with tweezers with the green mark to the right side, heat the pad with the iron (do not use hot air) and slide the led in, make sure it has a good joint, solder the other side and check for electric short, clean it up with Isopropyl alcohol. Do the same for the other leds.</p><p>If all went right, you should end up with something like this:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/sVk6Pqc.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/sVk6Pqc.jpg" /></span></p><p>This colors wasn&#039;t chosen at &quot;random&quot; it has some logic behind it:</p><p>Power = Red<br />System = Orange<br />Wired Network = Green<br />Wireless Network = Blue</p><p>This is my &quot;logic&quot; by the way, choose your own. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />Check all your work, reassemble the unit, take a step back and enjoy. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /><br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/6X39rwj.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/6X39rwj.jpg" /></span></p><p>Please note that the pictures show washed out colors, for some reason my camera (Sony NEX-F3) can&#039;t capture the led&#039;s true color that is more vivid and beautiful.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>katananja</strong> on 16 Sep 2013, 23:50)</p>

					<p>Neat.<br />But about LED polarity: there is no threat in putting it in the wrong direction, it will just not light up. But there will be no damage to either the LED or the router by doing this mistake.</p>									</div>

					<p>Could you please explain, how this should work out? My understanding of a misplaced diode (or LED) is, that it blocks the current, so it has an almost infinite resistance. And without a current, nothing can burn.</p>									</div>

					<p>The power source in your image is confusing me a bit. Is the following image representing your intention (left side regular configuration, right side with LED in reverse polarity)?<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://s24.postimg.org/ce84s2dhh/Router_LED.png" alt="http://s24.postimg.org/ce84s2dhh/Router_LED.png" /></span></p>									</div>

					<p>Maybe MSB...</p><p>But there is something wrong with your schematic already, in your schematic both Vcc are equals and they are not. If we take the schematic on the right I would rename Vcc to Vcc1 and Vcc2(led), I don&#039;t know where Vcc2 comes from and isn&#039;t from the same Vcc1, because Vcc2 on my board is dead and Vcc1 is not.</p><p>Since Vcc2 comes from some place else we don&#039;t know, when &#039;Q&#039; it&#039;s not ON a small current can flow from Vcc1 to Vcc2, damaging what ever is sending Vcc2 IF it is in fact Vcc, it coud be a DATA BUS, a CONTROL BUS, a ADDRESS BUS, I/O BUS, etc.</p><p>Now, that is the point.<br /><strong>We don&#039;t know the current circuit schematic</strong>, it can be anything, all we are doing so far is to guess what went wrong. And since we are guessing it&#039;s like trying to catch our own tail running in circles.</p><p>Be my guest, buy a 4300, open it up, revert the wireless leds and share with us your findings.</p>									</div>
