					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have Attitude Adjustment 12.09 on a D-Link DSL-G624T (H/W Ver.: A5 with 32 MB onboard).</p><p>It works fine except for being somewhat &quot;fuzzy&quot; when it comes to supplying an ip address to my two tablets.</p><p>These tablets are one Mediacom Smartpad 101s2 with Android 4.1.1 and one Start101 with Android 4.0.3, while my OpenWrt router is configured with WPA2-PSK.</p><p>Actually they both seems to associate but then they remain stuck at &quot;obtaining an ip address&quot;, until I switch off and on again the router and then they are able to connect fine. It doesn&#039;t help just turning off and on again the wifi on the tablets.</p><p>I have some other device that always connect fine, two iPod Touch, three Samsung Android 4 phones and one Samsung Bada phone, the problem only arises with my two Android tablets.</p><p>Could it be an issue with my router configuration or perhaps a problem on my tablets?</p><p>Many thanks in advance for your help.</p>									</div>

					<p>I can confirm this problem with a completely different hardware:<br />at me it obtains sometimes, I cannot see what the problem is. I think it&#039;s kernel-related, as with a version &lt;3.10.4 I&#039;ve had this problem, too, with 3.10.4 I didn&#039;t. Here it is an ath-based Buffalo WZR-HP-AG300h and Motorola and Samsung Android devices are affected.</p>									</div>
