					<p>The reason I cannot connect via wifi is that setting the mac of the bridge &quot;lan&quot; will set the mac on the interfaces the bridge consist of.<br />Therefor wlan0 will get a new mac that won&#039;t match the bssid/mac in /tmp/run/hostapd-phy0.conf.</p><p>Any idea if this is a bug? Or rather a feature request to have the hostapd config file updated when the mac on the wifi device changes?</p>									</div>

					<p>Settings the mac for each interface of a bridge doesn&#039;t seem to be necessary.<br />A bridge will use the lowest mac of it&#039;s interfaces - even switch to a another mac if it&#039;s lower.<br />You could set the mac of the bridge afterwards, but it has to be the mac of one of it&#039;s interfaces.<br />OpenWRT set&#039;s the mac of the bridge by setting all interfaces to the same mac - well, that&#039;s one way to it it,<br />but it interferes with the inflexible hostapd. - That&#039;s some kind of bug or missing feature.</p><p>A trick to set the mac of the bridge freely would be to create a tun/tap dummy interface, set it&#039;s mac and use it<br />to create a bridge.</p>									</div>
