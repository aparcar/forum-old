					<p>Hi,<br />I am absolutely new to OpenWRT. I plan bying the Speedport w724v Type B modem/router. It is not (yet?) listed as supported in the Table of Hardware.</p><p>However - the original firmware seems to be based on OpenWRT. Maybe it is an OpenWRT which is branded and customized (castrated). The source code can be downloaded from the telekom web site:</p><p><a href="http://hilfe.telekom.de/dlp/eki/downloads/Speedport/Speedport%20W%20724V%20Typ%20B/w724_2.0_opensource_20140627.tgz">http://hilfe.telekom.de/dlp/eki/downloa … 140627.tgz</a></p><p>When searching for files with &quot;openwrt&quot; in the file name I find this amongst others:</p><p>$ cat ./package/base-files/files/etc/openwrt_release<br />DISTRIB_ID=&quot;OpenWrt&quot;<br />DISTRIB_RELEASE=&quot;10.03&quot;<br />DISTRIB_CODENAME=&quot;backfire&quot;<br />DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=&quot;OpenWrt Backfire 10.03&quot;</p><p>Are there any big obstracles to be expected to put a real OpenWRT on the device?</p>									</div>

Or is that impossible due to legal or other issues?<br />- If the telekom/Arcadyan firmware is based on OpenWRT - would it be possible to somehow &quot;convert&quot; the telekom sources into &quot;regular&quot; OpenWRT - e.g. by substituting the telekom GUI with the regular OpenWRT gui package (if the GUI is somehow isolated enough to do this)</p><br /><p><strong>Telekom source code incomplete - doesn&#039;t compile</strong><br />I tried to compile the telekom firmware.

The next build didn&#039;t complain about drv_mei_cpe anymore, but then the missing drv_dsl_cpe_api_vrx-4.15.2.tar.gz was the next trouble.</p><p>I tried the same for drv_dsl_cpe_api_vrx-4.15.2.tar.gz (also available from xdarklight on github), but this time I wasn&#039;t lucky. </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>gzip -dc /home/frank/Downloads/w724_2.0_opensource/dl/drv_dsl_cpe_api_vrx-4.15.2.tar.gz | /bin/tar -C /home/frank/Downloads/w724_2.0_opensource/build_dir/linux-platform_vr9/drv_dsl_cpe_api-4.15.2/.. -xf -

					<p>Hi @Sisyphos.<br />How is your actual state of the project? Did you manage to bring up the openwrt on the speedport?<br />Thanks for your instructions, I was able to complete the build process by using the drv_tapi 4.7.3.6 source package.<br />(ATM I don&#039;t applied the customized patches which are provided provided, by renaming the folder package/infineon-utilities/feeds/ifx_voice_cpe/ifx-voice-cpe-tapi/src to package/infineon-utilities/feeds/ifx_voice_cpe/ifx-voice-cpe-tapi/src_orig). Some files are needed tough, I took some from here <a href="https://github.com/uwehermann/easybox-904-xdsl-firmware/tree/master/dl">https://github.com/uwehermann/easybox-9 … /master/dl</a>).</p><p>Now I don&#039;t know how to &quot;install&quot; the image. The bin folder contains the following files:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>kernel-debug.tar.bz2
openwrt-ltqcpe-squashfs.image
openwrt-ltqcpe-uImage</code></pre></div><p>The embedded installer at the web frontend don&#039;t like the openwrt-ltqcpe-squashfs.image file :-(<br />Are there chances to flash the image via serial connection or TFTP or so?<br />There is an function at image.mk which defines a function Image/mkfs/jffs2 which is never called.<br />Can I check how this function can be called, and perform this function?</p><p>(As side node: I&#039;m afraid that not alle files are provided, e.g. I can&#039;t find the Telekom specific html pages...)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>QAuge</strong> on 5 Apr 2016, 11:41)</p>

					<p>Hi QAuge,</p><p>I didn&#039;t continue working on it. I finally managed to compile the provided open source code. I needed to download a ton of additional open source libraries which were not provided with the Telekom package (which is no GPL compliant behaviour of Telekom I guess, but only authors of these packages can sue them). I didn&#039;t even try to flash the resulting image, because I was sure it wouldn&#039;t be accepted by the router. The original Telekom image on the router is somehow encrypted, and the build process of the provided open source package doesn&#039;t include this encryption routine. </p><p>The encryption method&nbsp; is a fixed key xor followed by a byte scrambling. The length of the xor key length is 160 bytes, but the key is changed after maybe 2 MB (?) (not sure if i remember correctly) of data.</p><p>In the process i gained some crypto knowledge (I&#039;m not a crypto expert unfortunately), but not enough to get it decrypted completely. I was able to undo the scrambling. But I could only extract parts of the key (or better: the keys). </p><p>If some one is interested on continuing these efforts, I could share the insights I gained about the scrambling and the xor encryption.</p><p>My guess is, that the installer embedded in the original firmware does the decryption, and then flashes the decrypted image. Other possibility would be, that the hardware itself does the decryption, and the encrypted firmware is directely flashed, and the installer only checkes if the firmware is correctly encrypted.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi sisyphos!</p><p>Thanks for your explanations about the decryption <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />&nbsp; Sadly that&#039;s not my line - so I think someone other can try to decrypt the image. In my opinion I think the decryption is done at software. I looked at the GPL-sources of the type C of this device, an I found out, there is an binary called &quot;imageupgrade&quot; which is called via the webfrontend. This binary has a command line switch to decrypt (and flash) an given image. Maybe with this device it is similar. As you wrote, we don&#039;t know because of the incomplete sources.</p><p>So is there any chance to flash an compiled openwrt on this device (Sorry, I don&#039;t have some experience about openwrt, I&#039;ve&nbsp; done only some freetz-ing)? Has someone checked the boot process via the serial command line? (At the wiki there is a big &quot;yes&quot; on the serial line feature). (Maybe I should do it, and provide some logs - if there are any available).</p><p>Again, thanks for your effort.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi bartosznowak,</p><p>what exactly do you mean? Are you searching for the original firmware, provided by Telekom? You can download this from Telekom website:<br /><a href="https://www.telekom.de/hilfe/geraete-zubehoer/router/speedport-w-724v/firmware-fuer-den-speedport-w-724v-typ-b">https://www.telekom.de/hilfe/geraete-zu … 724v-typ-b</a></p><p>This is of course capable of doing VoIP. </p><p>Or are you asking for an open source OpenWRT firmware? <br />The wiki suggests it&#039;s not yet supported:<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/t-com/spw724vtypb">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/t-com/spw724vtypb</a></p><p>Not sure if you can actually use this device behind another modem.</p>									</div>
