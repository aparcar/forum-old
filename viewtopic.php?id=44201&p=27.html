					<p>Hi everyone! Great job for posting all this useful info!</p><p>1. Sorry for chiming in like this, but may I ask why is it necessary to upgrade the flash from 8mb to 16mb on the WDR7500 v3 ? I&#039;m asking because I found a seller on aliexpress who ships the WDR7500 with openwrt preinstalled. Asked him about the size of the flash and he said it&#039;s 8mb. He claims that 5GHz works fine and everything is perfect(like any seller would do meh..).</p><p>So can anyone tell me what will the router lack if it gets openwrt with only 8mb flash?</p><p>2. Also the only difference between Archer C7 v2 and WDR7500 v3 seems it is the antennas. THe ARcher C7 v2 has 3 external and 3 internal the WDR7500 has 6 external. The price nowdays seems almost identical, or very close. Is there a point in getting the WDR7500 for the 3 extra external antennas?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>spiritfly</strong> on 29 Mar 2015, 06:51)</p>

					<p>Thanks. Helpful to know. I&#039;ve made good progress by swapping in a SB6120 modem and returning to an<br/>to an almost pristine network config. I&#039;m not seeing IPv6 addresses and able to ping.<br/>However, my downstream machines aren&#039;t binding. When I do &quot;rdisc6 br0&quot; on my Fedora, for instance,I get a nice long report that<br/>includes &quot;Stateful address conf yes&quot; and &quot;Stateful other conf yes&quot;<br/>Shouldn&#039;t those both be &quot;no&quot; ? I believe this is coming from the C7, but I can&#039;t figure<br/>how to fix it. Any hints much appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>You can install the BB 14.07 release which has working 2.4GHz and a web interface in the image. For 5GHz you need to install the ath10k driver (this can be done from the web interface too if you are afraid of the command line).</p><p>If you want to install a trunk image (latest development), you need to install the web interface via SSH.</p><p>Gigabit LAN should work in either case.
