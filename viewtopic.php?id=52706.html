					<p>Hello every one,</p><p>I&#039;m an Arduino/C++ guy, and I was working on a school project that included an HLK-RM04 wifi device. All was going well, until I left my board alone with a &quot;friend&quot; who installed OpenWRT on it while I was away. lol</p><p>I have no doubt that OpenWRT is better the the original firmware, how ever now I&#039;m stuck. I know pretty much nothing of Linux, well I know &quot;startX&#039;. lol any way, I got stuck in middle of this anti-corporate war, that I have nothing against since I&#039;m pro-OpenSource.</p><p>I knew that sooner or lather I would have to face this linux challenge, although not now would of been a better timing.</p><p>I&#039;ve been reading, for hours, the documentation on the Openwrt site, basically running around in round not understanding any thing, so I give up and ask for help </p><p>Basically I just want to start the WIFI interface so I can go on on my school project. I had my lesson I will never leave my equipments alone with any one any more.</p><p>Can any one please help?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>frederic.plante.76</strong> on 13 Sep 2014, 05:34)</p>
