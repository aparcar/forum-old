Then set-up routes on the main router to route all traffic for that subnet to that WAN port. The WR1043ND should then be set up with a static IP, NAT and firewall turned off, and routes configured to send all traffic for the 192.168.0.0/24 subnet to it&#039;s WAN port.</p><p>This would only achieve routing between the two subnets though. Do the clients on the WR1043ND require access to the internet via this connection? If so, I think you&#039;re out of luck, as the main router&#039;s NAT cannot serve them. Only way to achieve that would be to bridge the networks or use 2 layers of NAT, which you don&#039;t want. </p><br /><p>Disclaimer: I&#039;m a network amateur here, just thinking about how I would go about achieving your goal, maybe someone knows a better solution.</p>									</div>

					<p>Imho you ALL are really OVER-complicating this.</p><p>assume starting from default config.</p><br /><p>1) do not disable firewall, just comment the &quot;option masq 1&quot; line in wan section.<br />add a new forwarding section wan to lan, similarly to the existing one that forwards lan to wan.</p><br /><p>2) set static ip for wan interface.<br />example, &quot;main&quot; router has 192.168.0.1. set the second router wan to 192.168.0.254, subnet 255.255.255.0, gw and dns the main router ip so 192.168.0.1.</p><p>3) on the MAIN router add a static route that points to 192.168.0.254 to reach 192.168.1.0/24.</p><p>it should be done, let me know <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

					<p>This is good stuff nebbia88!</p><p>A couple questions:<br />According to your suggestions, the relevant sections of /etc/config/firewall and /etc/config/network should look like the ones copied below with the exception of an IP flip, since my Main Router uses IP: 192.168.1.1</p><p>As you can see, my secondary router currently uses the WAN IP:192.168.1.5 with a Metric = 1.

					<p>Thanks nebbia88, this really helps.</p><p>Prior to your response I had tested and edited the posted configs but could not get them to work without re-enabling &quot;option masq 1&quot; which didn&#039;t make sense.</p><p>After 3 days of edits I suspected I had hosed my settings and flashed Chaos Calmer r44753 last night. Today I separated the two forwarding entries like you suggested but it still exhibits the same behavior: I can connect to my upstream clients but can never get Internet access without the Masquerading flag enabled. Not a big deal but certainly not ideal.</p><p>As a new user, I&#039;m unsure why Masquerading or OpenWRT&#039;s firewall is even necessary on a router already behind a gateway with its own firewall. Are the configurations you suggested equivalent to an iptables command such as:iptables -I FORWARD -j ACCEPT and would this be another option? After configuring over 100 different routers, I&#039;ve never had to spend days trying bypass a stubborn firewall I didn&#039;t need or want....sorry, just very frustrated.</p><p>Thanks for your continued help.</p><p>OG</p><p>Updated firewall modifications:</p><p>config defaults<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option input &#039;ACCEPT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option output &#039;ACCEPT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option forward &#039;REJECT&#039;</p><p>config zone<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option name &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option network &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option input &#039;ACCEPT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option output &#039;ACCEPT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option forward &#039;ACCEPT&#039;</p><p>config zone<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option name &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option output &#039;ACCEPT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option forward &#039;REJECT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option input &#039;REJECT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option network &#039;wan6 wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option masq &#039;1&#039;</p><p>config zone<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option name &#039;vpn&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option input &#039;ACCEPT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option output &#039;ACCEPT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option forward &#039;ACCEPT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option network &#039;vpn&#039;</p><p>config zone<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option name &#039;tor&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option input &#039;REJECT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option output &#039;ACCEPT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option forward &#039;REJECT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option conntrack &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option network &#039;tor&#039;</p><p>config forwarding<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option src &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option dest &#039;wan&#039;</p><p>config forwarding<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option src &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option dest &#039;lan&#039;</p><p>config forwarding<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option src &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option dest &#039;vpn&#039;</p><p>config forwarding<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option src &#039;vpn&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option dest &#039;lan&#039;</p><p>config forwarding<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option dest &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option src &#039;vpn&#039;</p><p>config rule<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option name &#039;Allow-DHCP-Renew&#039;<br />&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; SNIP &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>									</div>
