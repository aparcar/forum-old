					<p>Hi folks, I just set up my router with OpenWrt White Russian yesterday and I&#039;m having trouble getting my wireless running.&nbsp; I have the wired ethernet working fine, and can connect to the WAN over the wire.&nbsp; But wireless is not working so well.&nbsp; One of the previous firmwares I had tried on this router was Tomato, which I had wireless working on.&nbsp; It looks like many of the settings got carried over into this setup.&nbsp; I am trying to use WPA1 / TKIP.</p><p>On my laptop(the wireless client), I can see my ESSID being broadcast, and I am able to &quot;connect&quot; to it via Ubuntu&#039;s GUI NetworkManager Applet.&nbsp; It shows the signal strength bars that I usually only see when I am properly connected, however I am unable to ping the router or anything else.</p><p>I noticed in the X-wrt Interface Status, it says &quot;Encryption Key off&quot; even though the Wireless settings(WPA, TKIP, password, etc.) look like they are set properly.</p><p>Any help would be appreciated. <br />Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m thinking this might have something to do with my dhcp not being confirgured correctly on the wireless interface.<br />In x-wrt under Network -&gt; DHCP, it shows a table like this<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Name    Interface Interfaces          Action
lan     br0       eth0 eth3 eth4 eth2 Modify
wan     eth1      eth1                Modify
wifi                                  Modify</code></pre></div><p>Where the &quot;Interface&quot; and &quot;Interfaces&quot; columns are blank for wifi.&nbsp; When I click modify nothing happens.</p>									</div>

					<p>Actually, on the WRTSL54GS, eth2 is your wireless network interface (see <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WRTSL54GS)">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har â€¦ WRTSL54GS)</a> so your DHCP settings are probably correct.&nbsp; </p><p>I had a few problems both of my WRTSL54GS units after I flashed them.&nbsp; First, try using the web-interface to turn off all encryption and then shut off the radio.&nbsp; Then, turn the radio back on and try to connect.&nbsp; If it works without any encryption, you don&#039;t have a DHCP problem.&nbsp; Then, turn encryption back on and try to connect again.</p><p>Oh, you might also check to see if you have any MAC-address blocking enabled.</p>									</div>

					<p>Two things happened tonight:<br />Good thing: I got it working!<br />Bad thing: Not really sure what I did!!! <br />I cleared some nvram variables related to wifi_dhcp, but it might as well have been a reboot of Gutsy that cleared some stuff on my laptop...</p><p>Anyhow, DHCP is working... Now I&#039;ll start fiddling with something else instead! ;-)</p>									</div>
