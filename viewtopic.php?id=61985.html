					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I have a very simple and silly question, but I need to make sure the answer: At what layer are encryption methods applied? I mean when we specify psk2+aes in wireless configuration file does it mean that a secret key is shared before data transmission and each layer 3 (IP layer) datagram is encrypted with this key by using aes encryption algorithm?</p><p>Similarly, can we say when we install authsae on a device, it encrypts layer 2 (MAC layer) frames?</p><p>Thanks in advance. Also, I apologize for this kind of a question.</p>									</div>
