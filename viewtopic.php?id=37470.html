					<p>Hello Everyone,</p><p>I am running into an issue. This is what I will need to be able to do:</p><p>Reroute certain MAC address&#039;s to a proxy on another machine while all other traffic gets routed locally to tinyproxy (or another proxy that would work well on a WRT54GL (space being the issue)).</p><p>I have the above working currently, but I really need to be able to forward all the remaining traffic to something like: <a href="http://somefakewebsite.com/reg/&lt;MAC">http://somefakewebsite.com/reg/&lt;MAC</a> here, without the :&#039;s&gt;</p><p>The reason I need this is so I can add them to the iptables to allow them to get to the other proxy. </p><p>Tinyproxy doesn&#039;t seem to handle URL rewriting. I&#039;m not really sure if iptables can do what I want it to do. Any advice/suggestions?</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>
