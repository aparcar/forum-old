					<p>Hi everybody,</p><p>I&#039;m thinking of making international calls cheaper, but I don&#039;t want to use any voip provider.<br />I have internet on one end, but I have only landline phone on the other end, but I also have a landline &amp; internet in the middle (in the same country where the landline is). What I have in my head is the following:</p><p>Landline makes a call to the other landline (local call), where a gateway grabs the call, converts it to internet protocol and forwards it to a pc trough internet. On the pc I could run Gizmo, Ekiga, Skype or whatever is necessary, or it could be a device as well if necessary. Also I would like to set up some sort of logic in order to let normal landline to landline calls go through. For example the forwarding to internet would swich on after 30min of ringing or the forwarding would be offered by a voice.</p><p>The only info I need is....what sort of device is capable of doing this type of forwarding? Something cheap with low power consumption would be awesome <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> I thought of some smart device like fritz!box (or a wl500g with a Linksys Pap2T) would work with openwrt running maybe asterisk.</p><p>Any idea or suggestion is welcome!</p><p>Many thanks ahead!</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dp79</p>									</div>
