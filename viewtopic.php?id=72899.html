					<p>The &#039;hostapd&#039; project, and more accurately its &#039;wpa_supplicant&#039; side seems to have <a href="https://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/plain/wpa_supplicant/README-HS20">some level of support for this</a>.</p><p>You might need to wrap the sleeves and modify the package responsible for building the sources of wpa_supplicant (this would be the &#039;hostapd&#039; package found from the primary source tree), so as to configure the code-level switches responsible for enabling HS2.0 support.</p><p>You will also need to tinker around in the UCI configuration system so it knows how to read HS2.0 -related settings from /etc/config/wireless and write them to the wpa_supplicant&#039;s configuration file correctly.</p><p>Finally, you will need some fail-safe handling in the UCI system, in case some other WPA supplicant is being used (e.g. wpad, wpad-mini or hostapd-mini) which might not understand about HS2.0 -related settings in /etc/config/wireless.</p>									</div>
