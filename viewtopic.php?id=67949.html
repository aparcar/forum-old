					<p>Hi,</p><p>I was messing around with interfaces trying to get those @&amp;#%! privoxy and dansguardian working with my PIA VPN. </p><p>So the colors of the interfaces changed, but what bothers me most is that WAN which was previously in Red became Grey...I read here : <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=67926">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=67926</a> that the WAN color should be in grey.</p><p>So WAN in Grey is it bad?</p><p>What makes the changes is when I check the &quot;Covered Networks&quot; box when I edit a zone.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>
