					<p>Hi, my name is lostpacket and I was hit by OpenWRT</p><p>Searched a bit through the Google to see if there are users with problems like mine but didn&#039;t succeed <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>Ok, let&#039;s explain what are they:</p><p>1. Installed <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr1043nd-v1-squashfs-factory.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ â€¦ actory.bin</a> on TP-LINK TL-WR1043ND, v.1.8, through the System Tools &gt; Firmware upgrade. All seemed ok, but ...<br />2. ... after the reboot there wasn&#039;t a Web UI. Sum&#039;d 2+2 and installed LuCI. Everything was fine except that ...<br />3. ... the interface doesn&#039;t load after each reboot. Checked that the uhttpd is in StartUp list - yes, it is there, LuCI too. Everytime after reboot I must manually start the web server with /etc/init.d/uhttpd start ... Ok, moving on to the next ...<br />4. ... problem. Found that after reboot the access to the router is randomed. For example sometimes it allows access only through telnet, sometimes through the SSH. The interesting part is that SSH waits only for the default root password, nevertheless it was changed at first telnet session after the installation. Goto 5<br />:5. Read this tutorial for USB - <a href="http://h-wrt.com/en/doc/flash">http://h-wrt.com/en/doc/flash</a> . Everything seems fine (in Web UI, under Mount there are /dev/sda1 as SWAP &#039;64MB, /dev/sda2 as RootFS &#039;64MB, /dev/sda3 as /home &#039;7700MB), but sometimes after reboot I&#039;ve got error while trying to do mount_root. Yes, I must mount that manually (weird) so I can use the Web UI. Go go go to the next problem ...<br />6. Affirmative! Or not ... My main goal is to use OpenWRT on this TP-LINK as git/sqlite server, just for hobbyist goals, nothing special. It is behind another WR1043ND, in which I setup ports from 1 to 65000 to be forwarded to the OpenWRT. This range is the only one active, DMZ is stopped too, same with DHCP server. Doh, it&#039;s not working, not possible to connect to the OpenWRT (no ping replies). SSH is enabled with Dropbear WAN checkbox in Web UI.</p><p>The scheme is this:</p><p>Internet ---&gt; [main router with internal address 192.168.1.1] --- &#039;cable from main router&#039; switch to OpenWRT wan&#039; ---&gt; [OpenWRT with static address 192.168.1.3]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;--- &#039;cable from main router&#039; switch to the network card&#039; ---&gt; [my pc with static address 192.168.1.2]</p><p>So if I want to connect to OpenWRT, I must disconnect the cable from it&#039;s WAN port and connect the cable from my pc to one of its switch ports.</p><p>Can someone help me in this deadly situation?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lostpacket</strong> on 14 Mar 2012, 19:02)</p>

					<p>So no one has some ideas where&#039;s the problem with connecting? I already flushed the iptables, put a new cable between the pc and the router, but nothing changed <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> Only got a ping replies.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lostpacket</strong> on 15 Mar 2012, 02:27)</p>

					<p>and what&#039;s the lan-subnet of your openwrt-router ...&nbsp; 192.168.1.0/24? <br />if that&#039;s the case that&#039;s the problem. <br />the openwrt-router thinks that this subnet is reachable through both interfaces, so it&#039;s sending out packages on the wan or lan interface depending on the metric of the interface. but only one interface is actually connected to your lan... so hmm... how should this work?<br />If the second router should act as a dump AP, please configure it as <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap">dump AP</a>. You can even use the wan-port as lan-port, it&#039;s only seperated by the switch vlan-config.<br />If it should act as a router/firewall use another subnet on its lan.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 15 Mar 2012, 11:33)</p>

					<p>Yes. The main problem became bigger yesterday. Now I can&#039;t access the router through telnet or ssh in normal mode, only through telnet in failsafe <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />I did nothing - just powered it on and bang, nobody home.

					<p>having the same subnet on lan and wan doesn&#039;t work and makes a lot of problem. that you can&#039;t reach it now is one of it. </p><p>So don&#039;t do it! <br />You can run whatever you want on this device (but you probably will have issues with git on a device with only 32MB ram). <br />But this means you don&#039;t need any routing or firewall dhcp stuff on the router - so ok you are right, the network config isn&#039;t a dump AP it&#039;s a dump switch, but the dump AP config will be fine, just don&#039;t configure the wifi </p><p>So don&#039;t configure the wan-interface (remove it from /etc/config/network), just configure lan and connect a lan-port of your openwrtbox to the mainrouter. and disable dhcp and filewall (like in the dump AP document)</p>									</div>
