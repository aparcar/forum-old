					<p>I got 200...300Mbit tcp LAN to LAN performance with snapshot openwrt. With dd-wrt r29095 little bit more.<br />It was tested with different cables and network cards. I think there is a problem with the ethernet driver. Polling? DMA? PLL config?</p><p>The performance problem was also seen in a WR1043v4. There are little bit more CPU clock frequency, but little bit slower than Archer C7, with very similar hardware.</p><p>It looks like a platform default driver problem.</p>									</div>

					<p>LAN to LAN or WiFi to LAN or NAT LAN to LAN?</p><p>LAN to LAN doesn&#039;t make sense, as its only over the switch.<br />NAT LAN to LAN that seems about right, any faster than that is only via stock with the hardware NAT support (although that potentially creates its own compatibility issues).</p><p>Also, were you running iperf on the router itself, as that is not recommended as it WILL be CPU bound.&nbsp; eg on my Archer C7 running iperf on the router only achieves 148Mbit max but from a PC on WiFi to LAN it does up to 500Mbit.</p><p>Speed tests should always be PC to PC where there is unlikely to be a CPU bottleneck.&nbsp; I also would recommend iperf3 rather than iperf, as I have had iperf results when testing over the Internet that were completely impossible - faster than my broadband speed.</p>									</div>

					<p>Have anyone tried alternative ath10k firmware from Candela Technologies (candelatech.com/ath10k-10.4.php)? I&#039;m using it on my Archer C7 and it seems pretty realiable, however I can&#039;t run mastabog&#039;s tests. In my setup the bottleneck are 200Mbps ehternet powerline adapters (and I have no access to the back of the router without breaking stuff), so actually there&#039;s no point to test higher WiFi rates.</p>									</div>
