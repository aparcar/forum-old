					<p>Hi people,</p><p><a href="http://lartc.org/howto/lartc.rpdb.multiple-links.html">http://lartc.org/howto/lartc.rpdb.multiple-links.html</a></p><p>does the tutorial at this address apply to kamikaze too ?</p><p>I mean, the tutorial requires to edit the /etc/iproute2/rt_tables file in order to create 2 different routing tables.</p><p>Is there an equivalent solution in kamikaze ?</p><p>Also, the tutorial requires to issue the command:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ip route add default scope global nexthop via $P1 dev $IF1 weight 1 \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;nexthop via $P2 dev $IF2 weight 1</p><p>could I issue such a command in kamikaze too ? I managed to boot an image in kvm and issued &quot;ip&quot; and got this message: &quot;/bin/ash: ip: not found&quot;</p><p>Is ip installable with ipkg ? I found this but it&#039;s for whiterussian.<br /><a href="http://www.ipkg.be/package/5518233">http://www.ipkg.be/package/5518233</a></p><p>I ask these questions because I don&#039;t know exactly how openwrt is layed out and I was not able to have it run properly in qemu/kvm and I can&#039;t use vmware.</p><p>So I couldn&#039;t test myself, I&#039;d have to buy a router and try without any precautionary test.</p><p>Thanks for any help</p><p>PS one of the problems I have with it running in a kvm virtual machine is that even if I issue the -k it switch, the keyboard still doesn&#039;t work correctly. </p><p>As for the network, I still have to see how it is to be worked with. So I can&#039;t install nano; I hope you understand that working with vi with the semicolon being under god knows which key is not that pleasant.</p><p>PPS I know this will sound dumb, but I also don&#039;t get the differene between the 3 appliances</p><p>WRT54g<br />WRT54gl<br />WRT54gs</p><p>I looked at the web pages quite good but I couldn&#039;t notice any relevant difference.</p>									</div>
