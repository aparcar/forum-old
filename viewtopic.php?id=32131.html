					<p>there&#039;s a HowTo debrick router....<br />You can use an Nokia DKU5 DKU-2 CA-42... well those cables are not exactly usb cable, well those have an USB port, but it acts as BRIDGE, between USB--&gt; TTL Serial (TTL is not equal RS-232 Serial..... TTL works at 3.3Volts when RS232 at 12Volts even 24Volts)<br />So, you have to buy a cheap cable i wrote before, then you will able to connect at the TTL serial interface that you router board have.<br />be carefull what you will do, you can kill your routerboard....<br />You will need to establish connection with just 3 wires RX,TX,GROUND....<br />Hope help you... Ups, sorry about English, I just speak Spanish....<br />this link will help you... <a href="http://parkyjimbo.blogspot.com/2011/06/tp-link-mr3220-debricking.html">http://parkyjimbo.blogspot.com/2011/06/ â€¦ cking.html</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi humanblackstorm ,dont take my words as an expert ,Im just amature , I had same ur problem couple of times and by trial and error I restored to original firmware,<br />try what I did.<br />connect thru wired wit any IP,but lan gateway 192.168.1.1. open cmd window with&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ping -t 192.168.1.1&nbsp; ,connect power but as soon as first LED light appears start multiple pressing on QSS hardware button(this important) for about 10-15 seconds and leave it,in secods it will start to make a very fast flashing (SYS&nbsp; LED),then open Putty and putt&nbsp; &nbsp;root@192.168.1.1 thru telnet not ssh,now change password as instructions,but u have to change it to a strong pass not simple one&nbsp; like admin but a longer password ,dont exit telnet window. now the nice part where u putt this command in the same command window&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;mtd -r erase rootfs_data&nbsp; ,it will reboot by itself, then give a time of 2 mins then waaaw it is back to life,..again Im not expert at all, but I will be very happy to hear a good news from u.</p>									</div>
