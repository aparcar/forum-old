					<p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=34191">This is my post</a> in another forum about the very same topic.<br />In a few word: I&#039;d like to use a USB 3G dongle as a backup of my main PPPOE xDSL conenction.<br />So far I&#039;ve been able to bring both up and running with a shent of load balancing and a few issues.<br />Unless I&#039;ve done something wrong (which is possible as the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/multiwan">WiKi pages about this</a> are confusing to me at the language level), the recovery procedure seems not to work.<br />And, yet, the fail-over configuration is far from my understanding.</p><p>Is there anyone trying to do the same? Is he/she willing to share the experience with me?</p><p>TIA.</p>									</div>
