					<p>I recieved the newest linksys router today -- wrt3200acm -- and immediately tried to install the openwrt rango image.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I wont enjoy the new router today as the image has put my router into an odd state where I cannot connect to the routers website but I can access any other website, all while the power light flashes.&nbsp; A 30/30/30 reset is not working either, and overall because of the odd nature of these issues I figured I&#039;d ask if anyone else had similar issues.&nbsp; It could just have been a bad flash but I wasn&#039;t sure because of the other issues.&nbsp; Please let me know if you have struggled with this new build, or anything I could be missing about the router/build in general.</p><p>Thanks for the help</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi mate a 30/30/30 reset is a old ddwrt thing. You are verry brave to test such new firmware.lol&nbsp; You are lucky not to end up with a bricked router. You cant get to the routers userinterface because there is not one installed. The build you have installed is from trunk and it does not come with luci installed. To install it you need to down load putty and Telnet or SSH to your router at 192.168.1.1 username is root and I don&#039;t know what your password will be. Then when you get logged in at the command line tipe.<br />opkg update<br />opkg install luci-ssl<br />/etc/init.d/uhttpd start<br />/etc/init.d/uhttpd enable<br />reboot</p><p>let the router reboot.<br />Now you should be able to connect to the web server serving LuCI at <a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a>. <br />More info here:<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials</a></p>									</div>

					<p>@tapper</p><p>Actually it&#039;s opkg update &amp;&amp; opkg install luci, no need to start httpd. Also, if luci-ssl is installed, the address is <a href="http://httpS://192.168.1.1">httpS://192.168.1.1</a>.</p><p>nitroshift</p>									</div>
