					<p>Still looking around.</p><p>The FreeRADIUS people suggest that:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Optionally, if you want to strip all realm names (i.e. you want user joe@domain.com to authenticate as just &#039;joe&#039;), then in file /etc/raddb/mods-config/sql/main/sql_dialect/queries.conf , under the &#039;query config: username&#039; section, you MAY need to adjust the line(s) referring to sql_user_name. For example, in uncomment the line:</p><p>sql_user_name = &#039;%{Stripped-User-Name}&#039;</p><p>...and comment out the following line referring to just User-Name. If you want to see what&#039;s happening here, switch on all the logging options in radiusd.conf and run radiusd in debug mode (-X) to see what&#039;s happening : you&#039;ll see &quot; user@domain&quot; being passed to SQL when using User-Name, but just &quot;user&quot; when using Stripped-User-Name. Of course, set all your other SQL options as needed (database login details, etc)</p></blockquote></div><p>Does anyone know where the queries.conf file is?</p>									</div>

					<p>Not directly. But because I develop hotspotsystems for a living, several times I set up a remote freeradius+mysql. Remote, because of resource limits of the openwrt box, and because of further processing of the radius data (i.e. user accounting). sql config for freeradius depends a bit upon host OS. But there is a very good doc: wikiDOTfreeradiusDOTorg/guide/SQL-HOWTO<br />I strongly suspect, your issue is _NOT_ openwrt-related but a general question regarding freeradius config.<br />Which is a bit black magic, I have to admit.<br />You might post your question on the freeradius forum.<br />Another approach would be, to set up freeradius+mysql according to the mentioned doc on a small unbuntu server (vps is about $10/month); and then port to openwrt.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>augustus_meyer</strong> on 15 Sep 2017, 09:10)</p>
