					<p>Hi guys, I&#039;m in stuck with this strange problem about LAN on my fonera 2200. <br />Basically I can&#039;t ping it at all, neither to access to redboot. <br />With a serial cable I can see redboot normally work, expect for this error, related to eth0:</p><p>/home/alfa/Atheros_Beta5.0/linuxsrc/src/redboot_fon1/ecos/packages/devs/eth/mips<br />/ar531x/current/src/ae531xecos.c#415:ae531x_send eth0 Tx: cannot get txDesc</p><p>This problem appear suddenly, after months it was perfecly operational. It was however clocked to 200 Mhz that is generally considered a safe choice for a 2200.</p><p>I try everything on my own, changing mac and serial, powercycling, try to reflash redboot<br /> partitions and configurations but with no luck. With a 2100&#039;s redboot my 2200 work well, but with the power led off, reply with this string: PHY ID is ffff:ffff<br />It is normal? Could be related to this problem?</p><p>I&#039;ll very appreciate any suggestions.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mazxim</strong> on 12 Feb 2009, 17:12)</p>

					<p>I did it. I flashed with that .bin with no results, I got same &quot;cannot get txDesc&quot; error. Since I cannot verify if the hardware is damaged (most unprobable) I suspect the problem could be related to a redboot misconfiguration. With a 2100 redboot I got PHY ID ffff:ffff string out as a message on redboot console. It is normal? It is so strange even because if I total erase and replace the redboot area I should have clean up somehow all misconfigurations. To reflash I just use the command &quot;fis create RedBoot&quot;. Maybe could be better to try directly with the hex locations?</p><p>Thanks for reply.</p>									</div>

					<p>I had this problem *before* start to playing with the redboot partition as I thought it was probally related to it. As I said, it worked well as a repeater with dd-wrt and beside it&#039;s concerned instablity, was fully responsive and safely located on a dry place. It sound weird to me that somehow was compromised *only* the lan part, I don&#039;t understand what you mean with &quot;high loads&quot; since the lan was however very less used compared to wifi part and was not powered for long period. I&#039;m not sure but I suppose these parts are pretty much integrated on single chips, no? I never had the need to open the case but now (i&#039;m defenitively unexpert in elettronic stuff) the board looks good. This obviously doesn&#039;t mean nothing.</p><p>Now I come back to original redboot partition but the 2100 one does it work well beside it&#039;s problem with the leds (on 2200 model). I don&#039;t know if they are interchangeble. </p><p>On a telnet session via wifi, trying to up the eth0 with ifconfig command, Ii simply don&#039;t up nothing.</p>									</div>
