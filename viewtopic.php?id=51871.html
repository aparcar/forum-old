					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a few port forwards set up on my router (currently on BB r41835), and it seems that after a reboot I need to manually restart the firewall to get fully operational again.</p><p>As an example, I have one rule that forwards UDP port 10013 to a machine in my lan. The external device that uses this port sends UDP packets with 10 seconds intervals.</p><p>This is how the redirect looks:</p><p>config redirect<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option target &#039;DNAT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option src &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option dest &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;udp&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option dest_ip &#039;192.168.12.126&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option name &#039;Test1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option src_dport &#039;10013&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option dest_port &#039;10013&#039;</p><p>After a reboot, this redirect does not work until I manually restart the firewall:</p><p>/etc/init.d/firewall restart</p><p>Reloading does not work, it needs to be restarted. The packets still arrive at the wan interface (obviously), it&#039;s just that they are not forwarded anywhere.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure how to diagnose this, because the config is obviously working after a firewall restart, and during a reboot the firewall is also by definition restarted.</p>									</div>

					<p>Anyone knows if this behaviour could be a bug? Could it be related to the fact that packets are coming in while the router is still booting (before firewall is operational), creating entries in the connection tracking table that confuses the firewall?</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, thats exactly the case.

					<p>Hmm. In my case I have a static WAN IP (I am actually using DHCP on WAN, but my ISP has a static lease of this IP), so I guess the solution as proposed will not work if it is triggered by a WAN IP change?</p><p>In my case, the problem appears because UDP-packets hits the router before the FW has been initialized (after a reboot), and the way I read this, it would not fix this problem.
