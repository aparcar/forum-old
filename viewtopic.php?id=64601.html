					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a WR940N V3 which the wiki says is similar to the WR941ND V6.<br />I flashed openwrt to it from the stock web interface. The router accepted the file and appeared to perform the update, but It didn&#039;t return to the interface or appear to reboot correctly.<br />The file I flashed -&gt; <br /><a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05.1/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-15.05.1-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr941nd-v6-squashfs-factory.bin">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal â€¦ actory.bin</a></p><p>To the point.. the wiki actually told me that this firmware will brick the unit but I missed that.</p><p>Now when I power cycle it, All the lights come on or a second, then the &#039;internet&#039; light turns from green to orange for a second, then all the lights turn off except the power led which stays on.</p><p>The numbered ethernet port LEDs do not light when i plug a cable in to them.<br />yep. bricked.</p><p>So I got out a USB -&gt; serial TTL adaptor and soldered it where the wiki says. </p><p>Connecting with &#039;goSerial&#039; or &#039;putty&#039; at 115200 8,n,1 None, gives me gibberish. in the past this was solved by setting the baud correctly but I tried all possible options but its still gibberish.</p><p>the wr941nd page also has a line on it <br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Note: The console output may have garbage characters in it, as well as it will not take input. In this case pulling TX high with a 15K resistor from 3.3 volt resolves this</p></blockquote></div><p>It kinda describes what I&#039;m seeing but it seems for a different version of hardware...</p><p>This page -&gt; <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr940n">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr940n</a> seems to imply that the serial console should work. it provides the root login details for the serial console on the stock firmware.</p><p>This Page -&gt; <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr941nd">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr941nd</a> says Chaos Calmer is not supported and will brick the international model. </p><p>Oops.</p><p>Any ideas? Id like to flash it back to factory.</p><p>Edit:<br />Mailing list where they discuss the brick that occurred <a href="http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/504451/">http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/504451/</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tpwn3r</strong> on 2 May 2016, 23:03)</p>
