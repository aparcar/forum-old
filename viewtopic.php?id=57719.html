					<p>I am running Chaos Calmer 15.05-rc1 on an Archer C7 as a wireless access point.&nbsp; I am trying to set it up as a secondary DHCP/DCPv6 server.&nbsp; I used DHCP option 3 on the advanced page to set the DHCP(v4) default gateway to the IPv4 address of my router.&nbsp; </p><p>How do I set the IPv6 gateway to the IPv6 address of my router?&nbsp; </p><p>Also what router advertisement server mode should I set?</p>									</div>

					<p>IPv6 configuration works differently. Router Advertisements are used to announce routes, DHCPv6 is mainly optional and doesn&#039;t do anything with routing.</p><p>For Router Advertisements there is also no &quot;router address&quot;, instead clients use the source-address of the&nbsp; RA as gateway for all the routes advertised by a router.</p><p>In general the default setting should be fine.</p>									</div>

					<p>The C7 canâ€™t be used as a gateway because it has nothing connected to its WAN port.&nbsp; I want the C7 to tell the clients to use the IPv6 address of my router as it does for IPv4 using DHCP(v4) option 3.</p><p>I hope Dnsmasq can do this.</p>									</div>

					<p>You did not listen, DHCPv6 does not have an option 3, there is no way to announce routes using it, the protocol doesn&#039;t specify it.</p>									</div>
