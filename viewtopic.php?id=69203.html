					<p>Hello everyone.</p><p>I currently run a (Huawei) LTE-Modem which i got from my provider. This device has the ability to run a so called &quot;bridge mode&quot;. It allows me to use my wan-ip-address on my main router, which gets it via DHCP.<br />The Modem is then unvisible for everyone.</p><p>[ISP] &lt;-------------&gt; [LTE-MODEM] &lt;--------------------------&gt; [Main-Router] &lt;----------------&gt; [Several Subnets]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;WAN-IP via DHCP</p><br /><br /><p>I now wanted to replace the device whith a device, that runs OpenWRT. I got a LTE-Card working, so i have an internetconnection via the interface wwan0.</p><p>Is it now anyhow possible, to setup openWRT, so that it will passthrough the wan-ip address and act like a bridge?<br />I found <a href="https://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-replies.cfm?t=2530290&amp;p=18#r360">this post (bottom of this page)</a>, where someone describes how to do it, but this is outdated and does not work anymore due to the fact, that dhcpd isnt available anymore.</p><br /><p>can openwrt do the same?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>buggers</strong> on 5 Jan 2017, 22:40)</p>

					<p><strong>buggers</strong>, to my mind the bridge is feature of modem, not router. If you specify DHCP in router settings, it behaves in right way?</p>									</div>

					<p>yes, but i want to replace my modem with an openWRT device, and openWRT cant do a &quot;bridge mode&quot; (also named &quot;ip-adress forward&quot; or &quot;single user mode&quot;)<br />and i want to know how to hack this into openWRT</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>buggers</strong> on 5 Jan 2017, 22:39)</p>

					<p>Yes you would just put the LTE modem (e.g. usb0) into the lan bridge instead of having a separate wan.&nbsp; The ethernet packets would pass directly to the modem then to the ISP.</p><p>By default, the lan network provides a local DHCP server, you don&#039;t want that so turn it off.&nbsp; Since there is only one public IP available from the ISP, only one device should ever submit a DHCP request into the modem, and that must be your other router.&nbsp; This means the OpenWrt device cannot (directly) reach the internet for internal purposes such as setting the clock or downloading packages.&nbsp; You can give it a LAN address so you can log into it.</p><p>It&#039;s not clear why you&#039;d do this rather than let OpenWrt handle all your routing and not use a second router.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 6 Jan 2017, 00:57)</p>

					<p>Thank you for your answer.<br />The problem is, my LTE Card (Sierra MC7455 connected via mPCIe) is using using mbim protocol, so there is no ethernet but direct IP (raw-ip) without ethernet-header. this makes the situation a little bit more complex.</p><p>this causes also the situation that there is no real dhcp from my ISP. so what i would have to configure is to<br />1) setup a DHCP that gives away the exact ip address from the interface wwan0<br />2) setup openWRT to forward every packet to the oposite interface (wwan0 --&gt; eth0 and vice versa)</p><p>is this &quot;hack&quot; even possible?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>buggers</strong> on 7 Jan 2017, 19:12)</p>
