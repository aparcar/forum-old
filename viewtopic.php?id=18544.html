					<p>Hi</p><p>I just installed openwrt on a wrt54gl ,) this is great, im connecting on a hotspot in client mode with a auto auth script running on cron and my 3 wifi laptop are behing a virtual AP and can surf freely.</p><p>Im very happy about this and it could stay like that but... I might be a kind of perfectionnist (but not enought to read linux for dummy til the end)</p><p>- So now I would like to set up a vpn connection from the router to another computer in my parents house who own a openvpn server.</p><p>I can connect to this vpn from my laptop but i&#039;d like to do this from the router so all computers here can share this tunnel</p><p>- at the moment, vpn is not forwarding internet true itself yet. Im reading openvpn handbook actualy but dont really know if it will work.</p><p>conf will be like this&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; net &gt; box 192.168.1.1 &gt; 192.168.1.50&nbsp; winxp &amp; openvpn server 10.8.0.1 &gt;tunnel vpn &gt; openwrtbox 192.168.1.1 &gt; local network.</p><p>- at the moment, I dont know how to set up a vpn client on openwrt....... I istalled the package but the /etc/openvpn is empty and I dont know if I must put the config file, ca and keys here or not.</p><br /><br /><p>Finaly, as my hotspot is very restrictive, i would like to forward everything who need the closed port but not the requests on open port.</p><p>like using port 80 on hotspot but all other port on vpn.</p><p>If I cant redirect like this, May I assign the SES button to start or stop a fully redirected vpn tunnel?</p><br /><br /><p>Sorry for writing a book ,) <br />thank for help</p><p>Glob</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>globul</strong> on 22 Jan 2009, 01:56)</p>
