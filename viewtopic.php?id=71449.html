					<p>I newly installed Chaos Calmer on my router. Also OpenVPN and DDNS is working well.</p><p>Now i have to change the standard IP Range of OpenWRT from 192.168.1.0 to something like 10.6.1.0 because some tutorials of vpn configuration mentioned to change the standard ranges...</p><p>Therefore i went into interface lan and change the ip of the router from 192.168.1.1 to 10.6.1.1 but after that it was not reachable any longer...i thought this should be the right way because i searched for dhcp addresses and only found that it start from 100 and ends up to 150 therefore i thought it would automatically recognize my change of the network...it seems not.</p><p>So, is there a tutorial&nbsp; or can please give me some information how to handle this change so i can reach my router.</p><p>thx</p>									</div>
