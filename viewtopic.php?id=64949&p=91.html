					<p>Hello community, FNG on here and just picked up an WRT1900AC V1. It was on clearance at Walmart for $60 so I couldn&#039;t just pass on the deal. So a friend recommended I install OpenWRT on this router so I did some looking around the interweb. Came across this forum and thread. So that leads me to ask. Are there any known issues to the firmware should I decide to flash OpenWRT on this said model? Another person I know who has the ACS version said that my model has been know to have issues and I wanted to come in here to maybe get confirmation. I&#039;m mostly intending to use this just exclusively for wifi devices and streaming Netflix and such. No gaming as I have another router for that in my home network. Who knows if I find it to be stable I may end up using it for gaming as well since I&#039;ve heard some high praise for SQM. So that&#039;s my story pretty much. In conclusion I want to find out really the stability of the firmware ( latest or old ). Looking forward to y&#039;all replies and I&#039;m happy to be apart of this community. Thank you for your time.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>R3MIX</strong> on 9 Jun 2017, 18:08)</p>

The solution would be to first change the u-boot boot parameters to the other partition, so that sysupgrade will think that it needs to flash this current partition (instead of the other).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 9 Jun 2017, 20:12)</p>
