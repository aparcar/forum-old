None. When you are setting a password and switching to ssh you might as well just start out with ssh for the first connection. Ever since Vista, Windows doesn&#039;t come with neither a telnet nor an ssh client out of the box anyway, so there is no point in installing two clients if you&#039;re using telnet just once. And Un*x usually already comes with both. Besides, obviously, telnet being insecure -- enforcing ssh is teaching good practice.</p>									</div>
