					<p>I&#039;ve had this problem too but I&#039;ve found a way around it. You can edit your /etc/init.d/S45firewall such that you forward port 22 on the WAN side to some host on your private network (be sure to comment out the SSH from WAN section). From that node on your LAN you should have no problem connecting to your router or any other node.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>femtonaut</strong> on 11 Aug 2005, 00:23)</p>

					<p>Many thanks!&nbsp; Setting PasswordAuthentication to Yes solved the problem.</p><p>The documentation is uncertain at best- the config file has the comment:</p><p># To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here!<br />PasswordAuthentication no</p><p>I&#039;m not sure I follow.&nbsp; But because I&#039;m using ssh to get to OpenWrt, I&#039;m pretty sure that the password I send isn&#039;t in cleartext anyway.</p><p>And...&nbsp; I can ssh to that linux machine, using a password, from other machines, just not from OpenWrt.</p><p>perhaps the taret linux box issues some kind of ssh authentication challenge that other PCs pass and OpenWrt fails, and therefore I can&#039;t use passwords.</p><p>Heck, I&#039;m speculating.</p><p>You got me up and running.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>									</div>

In theory, someone with root privileges on the server could see your non-encrypted password, but that&#039;s highly unlikely. Someone snooping the network traffic will never see your plaintext password - the SSH communication sets up encryption before you&#039;re even prompted to enter your password!</p><p>So, why would anyone ever disallow PasswordAuthentication? Because there is that possibility that someone on the server could see your password. When you use public key authentication, the server never sees your password (or pass<em>phrase</em>) - a different encryption-decryption-authentication method is used. For more information, see the Wiki page on <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/DropbearPublicKeyAuthenticationHowto">Dropbear public key authentication howto</a>... but note that it, too, implies that passwords are sent as plaintext! Argh!</p>									</div>
