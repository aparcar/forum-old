					<p>This is ATM over ADSL, right?&nbsp; I think the problem is that the hotplug infrastructure does not detect the ADSL modem training status, so it doesn&#039;t actually know when a PPP session is possible or impossible. I&#039;m not sure whether this is a deficiency in the driver or in the scripts... how does interface configuration work for ethernet NICs when link comes and goes?&nbsp; Is that the job of the DHCP client layer to poll the NIC for its link status (and so an equivalent script is needed for polling the ADSL device)?</p><p>There was another thread about this issue, including automatically reconnecting in general. I&#039;ve had to write my own script that polls the status and restarts the interface not just at boot but sometimes much later when ADSL sync is lost and my PPPoE session is not reset properly when the sync is restored.</p>									</div>

					<p>The hotplug support in the AR7 ADSL modem driver IIRC is still WIP, but NRForbes has been making some excellent progress towards this. You can experiment with his offerings at <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/2996">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/2996</a></p><p>As for the meantime, I get around this problem by adding the following hack to /etc/init.d/rcS :<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>sleep 35 ; /sbin/ifup wan  &amp;</code></pre></div>									</div>

					<p>I have uploaded a new patch to ticket <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/2996">#2996</a> which contains just the DSL hotplug support, so you can use it without all the LED stuff. You&#039;ll need to create a file in /etc/hotplug.d/atm which contains the commands you want run for each event.</p><p>As an example, this is what I had in a file called <em>10-leds</em> to change the LED state as the line syncs - I am sure you can adapt it to do what you require:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>DSL_LED=&quot;adsl&quot;

        SHOWTIME|remove)  
             led_off &quot;$DSL_LED&quot;
