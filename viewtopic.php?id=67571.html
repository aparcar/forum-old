					<p>Hi folks. I&#039;ve recently installed OpenWrt for the first time on a new Linksys WRT1200AC router that I got to serve as my first ac wifi access point. It&#039;s my first OpenWrt install. I&#039;ve used Tomato and DD-WRT before, and I still do actually, because I have a total of three wifi routers now. I&#039;ve got a bandwidth problem on the new router, though. If I have two computers connected to the ac wifi and do some kind of transfer between them, I&#039;m only getting about 350-400kB/s (kilobytes). But if I leave one computer on the ac wifi and connect the other to one of my other access points, I get over 5MB/s (megabytes). I&#039;m pretty good with networking in general, but this is my first foray into OpenWrt. Where should I start with trying to figure this out?</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, if you are using CC I suggest updating the wireless driver (I&#039;d say know issue). You can also use Kaloz images which already have the updated driver included.</p>									</div>

					<p>You can all so try gargoyle. This build has a updated&nbsp; kernel. gargoyle is built&nbsp; ontop of Openwrt it&#039;s the user interface that is different&nbsp; and some of the plugins. <a href="http://www.lantisproject.com/gargoyle_mvebu/newgui/">http://www.lantisproject.com/gargoyle_mvebu/newgui/</a></p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m using CC 15.05.1, yes, and problem solved! Thanks for the tips. All I needed to do was find the right spot in the device page under &quot;88W8864 mwlwifi&quot; (unable to post links). I followed the instructions there to install kmod-mwlwifi_3.18.23+10.3.0.17-20160531-1_mvebu.ipk, and it worked without a hitch.</p><p>I noticed there was an even newer version of the driver in the git repo, but I didn&#039;t try that one.</p><p>Thanks again!</p>									</div>
