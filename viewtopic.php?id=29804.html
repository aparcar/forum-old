					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m looking to reduce to global build time of a new project. For example, the first build (tools, toolchain, ....) takes about 90 min on our desktop PC. The first idea is to compile the toolchain once, and then to distribute it to the involved people, using it as external toolchain. </p><p>So I made following try:<br />1. get the project and compile with &quot;Build the toolchain&quot; option<br />2. install the builded toolchain from .../bin/target/&lt;openwrt-toolchain&gt; in my home folder.<br />3. get the project again from svn, configure it to use the external toolchain installed in the home folder and compile</p><p>But I get linkage problems with several packages (e2fsprogs, iperf, etc) using the &quot;external&quot; toolchain. The linker complains about some &quot;missing&quot; libraries, still if paths are ok.</p><p>So the basic question. Is this idea ok ? Can I re-use the toolchain in this way ? <br />Some points I had to knows ?</p><p>There is an alternative here:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/external_toolchain">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/external_toolchain</a></p><p>Any others ideas to reduce the time for the first build ?</p><p>Regards</p>									</div>
