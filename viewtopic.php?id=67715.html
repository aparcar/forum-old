					<p>The log option you have added in /etc/config/system is correct.</p><p>Execute from the command line (ssh) the quoted commands of my previous post and I think the problem will be solved. If you are not familiar with vi, install nano which is easier to handle.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>angelos</strong> on 26 Sep 2016, 01:09)</p>

					<p>I dont really know, why angelos suggested to set system to priority 50. That makes no sense to me. System should stay realy early in this chain, so let it stay at 10. If you look in the init.d scripts of system and log, you will also notice, that the system script does nothing with the log values in the system config, log does, which also reads the values from the system config. So in my understanding, it would make way more sense, to set fstab to a priority of 11, after system, and before log. System script just writes router name and sets time btw, nothing else, and this should happen in the first priorities, not at last.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makedir</strong> on 10 Dec 2017, 13:58)</p>
