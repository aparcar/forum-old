					<p>Hey there.</p><p>I do know how to do this by iptables in general, and I do know how to do this with the web gui. But I have absolutely no clue which specific iptables strategy OpenWRT has. So I stick to the web gui. I hope that&#039;s what you want.</p><p>Go to the &quot;General Settings&quot; tab of the &quot;Firewall&quot; page.<br />Usually you have a zone &quot;from LAN to WAN&quot; which has &quot;Forward&quot; activated. Uncheck this. That should block all outgoing traffic that&#039;s not caused by your OpenWRT device itself (that would be &quot;Output&quot;. Leave &quot;Output&quot; checked, there is no need to disable the OpenWRTs own outgoing traffic.<br />Now go to the &quot;Traffic Rules&quot; tab.<br />For each port you want to open, go to the &quot;New forward rule&quot; panel and add a new one. After saving (&quot;add and edit&quot;), you need to adjust the &quot;destination port&quot; and make sure the &quot;Action&quot; is set to &quot;allow&quot;.<br />That&#039;s basically it.</p><p>If you really want to have the traffic allowed in general, create a all-catching deny rule and spcific allow rules, then you need to have your all-catching deny rule being the last rule. Because rules are executed in a very specific order, the first matching rule counts. So if your first says &quot;deny&quot;, then everything is denied.</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>									</div>
