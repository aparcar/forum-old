					<p>I&#039;m trying to connect to Dropbear using PKI authentication. I pasted the pub key under SSH-Keys in Dropbear&#039;s GUI, however I can&#039;t figure out what settings need to be enabled for it all to work. When I attempt to connect using Putty, I get a reply back saying connection closed (PublicKey) or something along those lines. I tried disabling Password Authentication and Allow Root Logins in Dropbear, however, this has no effect. It won&#039;t accept the key at all. I have the correct pubkey syntax in the SSH-Keys heading. Anyone have ideas?</p>									</div>

					<p>Based on that error, I would try to confirm that putty is really using public key authentication, and is using the right key.</p><p>/etc/dropbear/authorized_keys should look something like:<br />ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC... &lt;name of key&gt;</p><p>What dropbear messages do you see (logread). Successful authentication will look like:<br />dropbear: Pubkey auth succeeded for &#039;root&#039; with key md5 ...</p><p>This is easier to troubleshoot with the OpenSSH client. You would do &#039;ssh -v openwrt&#039; and it would provide plenty of information about the authentication methods and keys offered. I do not know if putty has a similar option.</p>									</div>

					<p>I see. I know there are different outputs that have the pubkey, but the pre-key tags are usually ssh-rsa or ----Begin PGP Line-----. I&#039;ll try the ssh-rsa and that text to see if that works.</p><p>I got it up and running. Didn&#039;t realize that ssh-rsa needed to be included.
