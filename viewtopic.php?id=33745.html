					<p>Hey folks, I&#039;m trying to turn my ASUS WL-500W into a music player but I&#039;m running into barriers.</p><p>My router still has the stock BCM4321-based Mini PCIe wireless card.</p><p>I&#039;m able to get wireless functioning with a Backfire brcm-2.4 build, enabling broadcom-wl-mimo.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the sound libraries seem messed up.</p><p>I&#039;m able to get streaming music working with a Backfire brcm47xx build over Ethernet WAN, but of course there is no hope for 4321 wireless on that target.</p><p>I tried trunk (r29617) brcm47xx and sound seems OK, and I could configure a proprietary Broadcom wl driver but there was no wl-mimo option.&nbsp; In any case my trunk build isn&#039;t detecting the 4321 radio so no wireless luck here, either:</p><p>[&nbsp; &nbsp;19.004000] wl: module license &#039;unspecified&#039; taints kernel.<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;19.008000] Disabling lock debugging due to kernel taint<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;19.080000] SSB/BCMA glue driver successfully attached<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;19.084000] PCI: Fixing up device 0000:00:02.0<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;19.116000] wl%d: 5.10.56.27 driver failed with code 17</p><p>Took a closer look at <a href="http://www.broadcom.com/support/802.11/linux_sta.php">http://www.broadcom.com/support/802.11/linux_sta.php</a> to verify that their 5.100.82.112 hybrid driver supports the 4321.</p><p>Is there any hope for getting this functionality in OpenWrt?</p><p>TIA!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Braklet</strong> on 28 Dec 2011, 22:13)</p>

I didn&#039;t remove &quot;kmod-usb-audio,&quot; I just commented out the &quot;audio&quot; module load in /etc/modules.d/60-usb-audio and that allowed all programs that default to ALSA to work again.
