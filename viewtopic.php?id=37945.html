					<p>I have the WRT350N v2 downstream behind my DIR-825 and are using it as a NAS only. After open up firewall for samba and ftp it is working as it should. As the WRT350N has Gbit speed on the LAN side and only 100Mbit on the WAN port Im now trying to configure using LAN side only. My idea is to ditch the WAN port totally and use the router as a &quot;dumb&quot; attached DNS. I thought it would be to only set a fixed IP in the same subnet as the DIR-825, set gateway and DNS and I would be set. However, it turns out I cannot even ping to the router if I do that. From what I understand so should LAN-LAN communication be unrestricted, but I must have missed something. What have I missed here? Anyone have some idea?<br />Thanks!</p>									</div>
