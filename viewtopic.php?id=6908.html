					<p>Hi all.</p><p>I&#039;ve built an image using the whiterussian branch buildroot for an Asus WL-500GD following the shipped documentation, using uClibc-0.9.27.</p><p>Cupsd hangs on startup, no difference if I use the precompiled cupsd package or a self compiled. No errors logged with log-level debug2,<br />cupsd hangs on &quot;Full reload&quot;.</p><p>Well, tested downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/newest/bin/openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx and cups_1.1.23-2_mipsel.ipk, works out of the box.</p><p>I&#039;ve built an image using a fresh buildroot install without any modifications and tested with cups_1.1.23-2_mipsel.ipk, cupsd hangs, and probably a lot more.</p><p>Adding debug info to scheduler/mime.c shows clearly that cupsd loops in line 235 because of readdir() malfunction.<br />This is probably because of opendir() malfunction in line 220.</p><p>Tried to compile the code of opendir() and readdir() as myopendir() and myreaddir() in mime.c.<br />It fails with&nbsp; &quot;dereferencing pointer to incomplete type&quot; errors.</p><p>What to do as next ?</p><p>S.</p>									</div>

					<p>I am experiencing the same problems with a WRTSL54GS. I can&#039;t get a firmware that boots normally, only failsafe seems to be working.<br />Also nbd whiterussian images from 30 jul have the same trouble.<br />However, building a rc5 from source gives a working image (so my environment is working properly).</p><p>Any hints ?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Anael</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Spaetzle</p><p>Here&#039;s my suggestion: <br />Set the debug level to 0 and reboot.</p><p>I had a similar problem with the latest version of olsrd which made the DMZ LED of my WRT54G to stay permanently on. After changing the DEbugLevel to 0, the problem was sorted.</p><p>I do not know much about the cups package, but with olsrd when it is run manually with the debug level greater than 0 then it stays on the foreground. <br />So in that case imagine when the router runs the startup script of the olsrd from a reboot.</p><p>That&#039;s my 2 cent&#039;s worth.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>I did some tests on my WRTSL54GS with various svn revisions of whiterussian, using a customized image not very different from default (I can provide the .config) :<br />Every time I did a full svn checkout and rebuilt everything from scratch.</p><p>It turns out that the last revision I found that produces a booting image (not in failsafe) is 4134.<br />Revision 4155 is broken.</p><p>Then&nbsp; I guess the commit 4155 causes some trouble...</p><p>Anael</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>aorlinsk</strong> on 19 Aug 2006, 21:03)</p>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>It looks like the patch found in the buildroot-ng changeset 4634 applied on the lastest whiterussian makes the images working again...</p><p>Then I would suggest a backport in whiterussian !</p><p>Anael</p>									</div>
