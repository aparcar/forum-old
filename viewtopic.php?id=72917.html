					<p>ok - managed to install a trunk firmware and lost all GUI - SSH works on only 1 Ethernet port and I can log in.<br />Able to see network settings, set a static IP on WAN port and changed my home network to 192.168.1.2 to accomodate the device.</p><p>However - unable to get onto internet in spite of SSH working over LAN (suggesting it is now connecting on my home network after changing router to .2).</p><p>How can I get internet access onto the router please so i can re-install LUCI? banging my head against a wall at the moment... Many thanks in advance:</p><p>any help on commands in SSH to get to internet via ethernet would be enormously appreciated</p><p>Update: managed to restore LUCI:<br />used WINSCP - got WLan on and updated IP of ethernet<br />found Luci guide on Luci essentials how to<br />had to check the path in the guide for the &quot;script&quot; to find the actual files needed (no easy way to find them...)<br />copied offline, WinSCP to unit and executed, went to ip on URL and bingo! Now restored older GUI from Squash and back in business...</p><p>So - closing this post as this is now all sorted.</p><p>Next post will be about Wifi Repeater on same subnet - so far drawn 2 blanks with 1 solution (as per out of box on diff subnet with NAT) and another with same subnet but no Wifi and only 1 ethernet port bridge... that one feels closer to what I want...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rupert.abbott</strong> on 4 Jan 2018, 02:13)</p>
