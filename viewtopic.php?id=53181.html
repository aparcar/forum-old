					<p>Hello,<br />At present I am using OpenWrt &gt; Luci as the GUI. I have modified the theme to run with jquerymobile and CSS.<br />What I am now trying to work out is how do the scripts convert .Lua files to HTML files and output them in the browser. Currently it simply works, and my theme also works with it but i would really like to know how it is done.<br />I know where some of the files are and i can add things such as &quot;buttons&quot; lists, styles etc. However i would like to know how i can change the size of the buttons within a specific page. <br />Currently i set everything as global in the /themes/openwrt/header.htm file. And with other files which display everything using .htm files i simply add the CSS and jquerymobile styling to the .htm file which overrides the global settings and allows me to do specific styling to the page.<br />Here is a link to show you what i am looking at, (I am just a noob having a go and by no means do i understand even half of it). So any information would be great.<br /><a href="http://whrl.pl/Rd56jH">http://whrl.pl/Rd56jH</a><br />For a look at how the theme looks so far go here (sorry about the low quality video):<br />skip ahead to 2:45 min if you want to get past our website:<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=716QNKbaR00">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=716QNKbaR00</a><br />This allows me to login and easily use the theme on smart phones and also tablets (cross platform).</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not sure what your question is exactly, the things you mentioned are a bit too broad to explain in a simple forum post.<br />Anyhow, all HTML emitted by LuCI is assembled from templates and template fragments which are basically *.htm files with HTML snippets and special processing directives in it (the &lt;% ... %&gt; tags).</p><p>That&#039;s pretty much comparable to how programming in PHP works. I&#039;m afraid I cannot help you much further here unless you have more specific questions.</p><p>If you like you can also find me in IRC at #luci-hackers on freenode, maybe its easier to qanswer these kind of questions in realtime.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello Jow,</p><p>I have seen your name many times and I respect your work. I am honored that you would even take the time to reply to my post.<br />Sorry I am not very good at explaining myself.</p><p>What i am really after is:</p><p>I want to edit the layout of some of the pages in Luci but I cannot find the .htm files to do this.<br />I have done this as you can see on the video with several .htm files that we have added to luci for customization.<br />I have found that if i edit the .lua files associated with the .htm pages that i change things but i can not really change the layout much. So i cant line up the button in tables or move the to the left or right or make them bigger etc.</p><p>What i need to know is how does Luci take a lua file and throw it into a template and then publish it as a .htm page when i browse in Luci.</p><p>Someone posted this the other day and i am not sure if it is a clue?</p><p>Inside dev environment it&#039;s ./feeds/luci/po/template/[application].pot the translation template<br />Inside .../po/[language]/[application].po are the translations based on the template file.<br />The webpage is html/javascript but build by the lua/luci environment during runtime.</p><p>Cheers for taking the time Jow <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />I&#039;m originally from Munich.</p>									</div>
