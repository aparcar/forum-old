					<p>You can send in a patch to the mailing list or open a bug report.</p><p>As an aside: I have been running 15.05 on 4/32 MB devices just fine. If you don&#039;t use LuCi (and it seems you don&#039;t) you save some extra space, you can strip PPP support as well if you don&#039;t need that, that eats a lot of space as well. You should give it a try.</p><p>14.07 was the last release where OpenWrt devs built the &#039;old packages&#039; along with the official firmware builds etc., so you&#039;d need to check if the packages you need are either part of the official tree (don&#039;t think so), or community supported - see <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/packages">https://github.com/openwrt/packages</a> for the latter.</p>									</div>

					<p>PPP is mostly used for WAN connection when your ISP uses it, it&#039;s mostly used on DSL I think (PPPoA or PPPoE). It is also used in some VPN setups, for L2TP and PPTP.</p><p>To remove PPP, you have to deselect it from the Networking menu first, after that you can deselect the kernel modules.</p><p>In menuconfig, you can highlight any package, and go to Help and look at &quot;Selected by&quot; to see what packages have selected this package.</p>									</div>
