Since I&#039;m no developer, I&#039;m asking the questions: Could this info be useful for a developer for searching / comparing devices with the same chip / type of flash?<br />Could this info be useful for users who want to enlarge flash/ram memory?</p><p>Edit:</p><p>3) Why did you move out Identical to / AKA / Similar / OEM-firmware_url?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tmo26</strong> on 1 Jun 2015, 21:46)</p>

I give up, given what they did in 15.05 I have no case.<br />I have a horrible new idea: in the data entry, can we have<br /> - 14.07 factory image<br /> - 14.07 sysupgrade image<br /> - 15.05 factory image<br /> - 15.05 sysupgrade image<br /> - trunk factory image<br /> - trunk sysupgrade image<br />?</p><p>2) Problem with Flash Chip Type is that if there is two types of flash (16MB+128MB NAND) then the Flash Type gets complicated.

					<p>@zo0ok: I would put this step - &quot;Automatically generate 9XX data entries from old ToH&quot; - as the first item, then start the iterations...</p><p>That&#039;s because this tests the actual data we have (from the current ToH) instead of the data we think we have (if we create our own dataentry pages). </p><p>(I realize that we all would need to keep private/local copies of any modifications we made to the small number of dataentry pages that we experiment with (say, links to vendor pages/firmware, etc.) while we test out the broader procedure.)</p><p>My preference would be something like:</p><p>a) Automatically generate 9XX data entries from old ToH<br />b) Create a few device pages to validate the data entry template and our ideas<br />c) Review (and update, if needed) the data-entry-fields and/or the template for the detail page<br />d) Possibly go to (a) and iterate until we&#039;re happy </p><p>When we think that that things are pretty stable, then:</p><p>e) Automatically generate a &quot;final set&quot; of 9XX data entries from old ToH<br />f) Create a new dynamic ToH based on data entries &lt;== not sure of the order here...<br />g) Import 9XX data entires<br />h) Possibly go to (f or g) and reiterate (can we do this?)<br />i) Replace old 5x ToH with new dynamic ToH<br />j) Start working on (all the rest of) the Device Pages</p><p>Whether we do the automatic generation first or not, I will take a shot at one of the detail pages this week to move the process forward.</p>									</div>
