					<p>@klaberte, the password is kept as clear txt on the router is not good. This is because: when you setup your router for the first time, the password is set for both OpenWrt and wifi. As wifi key is clear text, so your password is clear text. But we know that this is not good. We are storing the password as SHA256 hash now. WiFi password will not be the same as OpenWrt and WebUI in the coming version.</p><p>The interesting thing is, most people don&#039;t change the default wifi password when they set up the router. So, there has been a way to force them to change the password. That is what we did. But we would like to change as people concerned.</p><p>The ddns is only for finding your device if you have a public IP. There is nothing more info submitted to our server. As you can read the code in /usr/lib/ddns/glddnsupdater.sh. You can disable this by just editing /etc/rc.local or remove this script completely. The first two letters of the ddns is generated randomly. So it is not so easily guessed. </p><p>But, of course, if you don&#039;t trust anything, just compile your firmware from source and install it on the router. That is what we encouraged.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sounds a lot like the lockouts i had with the NEXX. When i added an extra IP to the LAN then i got locked out of ALL networks.&nbsp; Only way to fix was login on the UART and remove the changes in the config files manually.</p><p>Not something that an &#039;average user&#039; can do.&nbsp; BTW. routers with a U-boot failsafe mode, does that failsafe also allow ssh logins?&nbsp; Or can it only be used to flash firmware??&nbsp; (i have not tried it yet)&nbsp; </p><p>For non technical users this still would seem to be a somewhat workable solution if SSH works in failsafe mode...&nbsp; Then they at least don&#039;t need to fence around with the &#039;hot-sword&#039;. however they then still need to wrestle with ssh, install nano (this is not standard in all OpenWRT firmwares??) and then manually hack the configs.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>BTW i still need to figure out if this bug is actually related to the lockout i described.</p>									</div>

					<p>As i read many of the posts related to user developed firmware, it is not clear that buttons and reset properly trigger fail safe or other actions, including the LEDS for operation status.&nbsp; &nbsp;It also is a problem for battery powered units for battery level reporting.&nbsp; In general the device does not have GPIOs well documented.</p><p>One would hope that things like SSH would be configured to operate the same in all product at the CC3 level.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think going forward, the first thing I will check after an upgrade is what happens when I trigger all the buttons and switches.&nbsp; It&#039;s too hard after that.</p>									</div>

					<p>@ RangerZ<br />What can users/noobs do to help the devs to improve the GPIO docs in a constructive way?<br />Would be nice if there was somekind of manual that lists some basics that devs need to do all the time to figure out GPIO stuff.

Then the devs have a place to compare data of devices.<br />Don&#039;t know if this makes sense, i don&#039;t have a clue what would work for the devs. I don&#039;t want to waste their time, I want to find a way save the devs some time with basic stuff. So that they have more time to focus on other things.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />This way the users also gain a little knowledge. etc. Closing the gap a little between users and devs</p><p>@klaberte<br />The guys at GLiNet have a lot of work on their hands, it&#039;s great to see a company that is openminded and close to the user base.&nbsp; The U-BOOT failsafe is well done on the 6416.&nbsp; I will give ddwrt a try if i can find the firmware..</p>									</div>

					<p>I think, but am not sure, that the early versions they radios were not balanced,and that this might have been the (a) connector that was added so they could read/adjust/balance.</p>									</div>

					<p>hmm so it is a connector... </p><p>small is ok but this is component size a bit #$@%.&nbsp; Does anyone know what type of plug that is?&nbsp; It&#039;s damn hard<br />to guess the right size hahaha</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://im01.taiwantrade.org/resources/member/53973/productcatalog/f18d4e09-c98d-4a41-b3ec-ff3af92d33f9_B0388857266.jpg" alt="WTF?" /></span>WTF?</p><p>IPEX MHF4, MHF, MHF2, MHF3.&nbsp; Right... <br />If they are not to pricey then i order one of each. </p><p>BTW, does anyone know how much current the voltage regulator can handle on this board?&nbsp; I want to connect a USB soundcard.

					<p>Actually it&#039;s the new GL-AR150.&nbsp; It&#039;s available with ($27) and without ($25) an antenna.&nbsp; I believe the on-board antenna is disconnected in the antenna version, so it&#039;s either or. </p><p>When you receive it please start a new thread.&nbsp; If your not in to much of a rush, can we please review the delivered product before any flashing?</p>									</div>
