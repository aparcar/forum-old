					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have two routers with two ADSL PPPOE (One PPPOE for per OpenWRT router).&nbsp; I have successfully enabled VRRP by Keepalived where Router-A serves as Active and Router-B servers as standby. </p><p>With this setup, I can sustain Internet access in node failure but ADSL PPPOE link failure. </p><p>As I know there are something called &quot;check script&quot; in Keepalived for native Linux platform. I am not sure it is available in OpenWRT.</p><p>See if anyone can give me some help to me. </p><p>Thanks in advance. </p><p>Happy New Year.</p>									</div>

					<p>Most platforms don&#039;t support PPPoE in HA configuration, rather the upstream devices would be configured as a router (only, i.e. no NAT etc). Of course you need more than one public IP for that configuration to work, one inside and one outside for each router device.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>J1mbo</strong> on 31 Dec 2015, 16:41)</p>
