					<p>Hi,</p><p>I try figure out how to use odhcpd for my setup.<br />There are three networks: wan, private and public.</p><p>I want Router-Advertisements (RA) from the public network to be relayed into the private network, so I do this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config dhcp
    option interface private
    option start 100
    option limit 150
    option leasetime 2h
    list dhcp_option &#039;3,192.168.133.1&#039;
    list dhcp_option &#039;6,192.168.133.1&#039;
    option ra relay
    option ndp relay

config dhcp
    option interface public
    option start 100
    option limit 150
    option leasetime 2h
    list dhcp_option &#039;3&#039; #no gateway!
    list dhcp_option &#039;6,192.168.132.1&#039;
    option ra relay
    option ndp relay
    option master 1</code></pre></div><p>(Only ra/ndp/master options are of interest here.)</p><p>This works as expected.<br />But I like to also announce an own prefix in the public network (using ula_prefix from /etc/config/network) as well.<br />This works when I replace &#039;relay&#039; by &#039;server&#039;. But now the RAs are not relayed anymore.<br />I tried to use &#039;hybrid&#039; instead of &#039;relay&#039;, but this seems no to work.</p><p>As for wan, it should just relay RAs in the private network.<br />But this is probably a different story. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I can achieve als this with using &#039;relay&#039; and an aditional RAs service like radvd.<br />But it would be nice if this would not be needed.</p>									</div>
