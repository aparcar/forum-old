					<p>Hi *,</p><p>I am trying to set up a mesh network and I would like to use WPA or WPA2. Now I wonder that encryption seems not possible in ad-hoc mode. According to the Wiki : <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless/encryption">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless/encryption</a>&nbsp; encryption should work with the wpad-mini package installed (no statement about ad-hoc mode there).<br />Tried Access Point mode an there encryption works.</p><p>Am I missing something or is encryption not supported with ad-hoc mode ?</p><p>Thanks, Stefan</p><p>P.S. Just tried also IEEE802.11s mode and this seems also not to work with encryption. You can enable Encryption in the GUI but then after scanning Wifi networks it pops up as open/non-encrypted. Again, what did I miss ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>StorageGuru</strong> on 23 Feb 2011, 18:45)</p>

					<p>Also, a caveat from the olsr-users listerv about using WPA2 encryption (should it become supported in ath9k + adhoc/mesh) with the higher bitrates:</p><p>&quot;You need to listen to 40000-80000 encrypted IP packets before you can calculate the 128 Bit key. Thats only a few minutes on a 802.11g full speed download.&quot;</p><p>The poster likened this to erecting a 50cm tall fence to keep out intruders.&nbsp; So, there does appear to be a point of diminishing returns.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>westbywest</strong> on 2 Mar 2011, 11:14)</p>

					<p>Encryption is implemented in open80211s!<br />So maybe you should give it a try and set up an 11s-meshnetwork with encryption. <br />You should be able to run 11n, but I&#039;m not sure if the encryption is done by the wifi-chip or if it&#039;s a softwareimplementation. </p><p>Check out <a href="http://o11s.org/trac/wiki/HOWTO#secmesh">http://o11s.org/trac/wiki/HOWTO#secmesh</a> for the securemesh implementation <br />and <a href="http://o11s.org/trac/wiki/OpenWrtBuilding">http://o11s.org/trac/wiki/OpenWrtBuilding</a> for the openwrt-specific part.</p>									</div>
