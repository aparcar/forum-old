Which is: lots of binaries but no source code since july.</p><p>Second, OpenWRT has (limited) access to those binaries through subscribers and they know very well that Sveasoft is using OpenWRT now. If you need a detailed analysis to believe them thats your problem. And if Sveasoft isn&#039;t using OpenWRT and thus not violating the GPL, then the invocation would be void and nobody has a problem.</p><p>Sveasoft has been playing this game for quite a while now. They keep using GPL code but they don&#039;t give anything back like they are required to. And YES, they have been asked many times for their source code (by subscribers and non-subscribers alike). So far all that got out is a the mentioned source code package from july which doesn&#039;t even compile.</p><p>However until recently they hadn&#039;t used OpenWRT directly, just &quot;borrowed&quot; some ideas and innovative hacks. This changed with a recent release and OpenWRT has reacted accordingly. If Sveasoft feels like that is unjustified they can declare that they don&#039;t use OpenWRT (which could be quickly disproven) or release the GPL source code as they are required to.</p>									</div>

Without releasing any source code.<br/>You can claim that its &quot;non-public&quot; all you want but the fact is that anybody who pays 20$ can get your firmware and nobody of the subscribers EVER get the source code when they ask for it. I know that from the visits I sometimes make to your forum with a friendly subscribers account.</p><p>You have been asked many times by your subscribers for the source code but like I said, the last time you released ANY code is July 2005. Since then you have released plently of publicly available binaries. I say publicly because anybody from the general public can get those files by simply paying you the 20$ you&#039;re asking.</p><p>Besides, the binaries you release contain neither the source code, nor a written offer for it. If that isn&#039;t a clear violation of the GPL, what is?</p><p>Also I consider its a pretty childish reply to say &quot;you&#039;re using my code without permission, too&quot;. If that was the case, why didn&#039;t you speak up earlier? And even if that was the case, that doesn&#039;t mean your allowed to use OpenWRTs code without releasing the source code.</p><p>Maybe its time for another Freeman release to give the public proof for your blatant abuse of the GPL. But I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll scream &quot;piracy&quot; in a matter of seconds. After all it seems to be ok in your book that you use other people&#039;s code while they can&#039;t use yours.</p><p>How about this: you stop using other people&#039;s code without a license and I stop redistributing yours without a license?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>TheIndividual</strong> on 12 Mar 2006, 11:22)</p>

					<p>Hmm... sveasoft posted quite an interesting story on <a href="http://www.sveasoft.com/modules/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=16013">http://www.sveasoft.com/modules/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=16013</a>.</p><p>Let me clarify a few things:</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>sveasoft wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>We had no prior contact with anyone involved with OpenWRT before their public notification and claim.</p></blockquote></div><p>In November 2005 I had an &#039;interesting&#039; IRC chat session with sveasoft in which I specifically asked him to respect our copyright (and others&#039; as well) and publish the source code for GPL&#039;d packages that he incorporated.<br/>I&#039;m sure that counts as prior contact. He told me that he was going to publish the source code for their &#039;Talisman 1.1&#039; release, which hasn&#039;t happened yet. </p><div class="quotebox"><cite>sveasoft wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>May 2005 - OpenWRT incorporates LZMA into bootloader/squashfs. Sveasoft copyright missing.</p></blockquote></div><p>Right, because there was no Sveasoft code in our implementation of it. Just because our implementation was added later doesn&#039;t mean that it is in any way based on sveasoft&#039;s code. There&#039;s no indication that there is any truth to the claim that we &#039;stole&#039; code from sveasoft, especially considering that our implementation was incompatible to theirs.<br/>By the way: We&#039;re talking about modifications of GPL&#039;d and LGPL&#039;d software, since most of the code (squashfs, the bzip2 loader that was used to create the LZMA loader, the C code for LZMA decompression itself) was already existing before sveasoft used it in their codebase.<br/>Both the LZMA loader and the integration code for LZMA decompression/compression in squashfs in OpenWrt were written by Oleg and based entirely on free software.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>sveasoft wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>December 2005 - OpenWRT releases switch support for ADM6996, robo controllers.

You are indeed correct that the GPL makes no special distinction for pre-release software and that anyone who receives binaries must also be able to receive the source. But... Sveasoft doesn&#039;t say they&#039;re restricting source because it&#039;s a pre-release. They say that their pre-release software is distributed only to a small group. As long as they provide the source code to the people in that small group, then they&#039;re not violating the GPL. In other words, they don&#039;t have to provide the source to anyone, only the people they distribute binaries to.</p>									</div>

Sveasoft doesn&#039;t say they&#039;re restricting source because it&#039;s a pre-release. They say that their pre-release software is distributed only to a small group.

					<p>Yes. He released all &quot;dev builds&quot; to all subscribers and nobody (not even testers) get the sources. I don&#039;t know about OEM customers but I&#039;m guessing they don&#039;t get them either.<br/>And yes, they have been requested by subscribers. Many times.
