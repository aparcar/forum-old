					<p>Hi,</p><p>I used the instructions at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build</a> to build OpenWrt images for Buffalo WZR-HP-AG300H by using the trunk source code.<br />The only changes to the configuration were to select the correct platform using &quot;make menuconfig&quot; (after doing &quot;make defconfig&quot; as instructed):</p><p>Target System (Atheros AR71xx/AR7240/AR913x/AR934x)<br />Target Profile (Buffalo WZR-HP-AG300H)</p><p>The build was successful, and several image files were created in bin:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>&gt; ls

After some more searching I found that this site<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtain.firmware.compile">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtai … re.compile</a> suggests to <strong>&quot;select your target before issuing defconfig&quot;</strong>. After following <br />that instruction, I managed to create sysupgrade files that are similar to those from openwrt.org.</p><p>From my experience, selecting the target <strong>before</strong> doing &quot;make menuconfig&quot; is essential, and if possible this information should be also<br />included <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build</a> to prevent other such problems in the future. </p><p>I made this post to inform other people of the problem and the solution I found. Should someone have any suggestions on this issue, please let me know.</p><p>EDIT: I just noticed that &quot;<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build</a>&quot; has been recently renamed to &quot;<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build2">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build2</a>&quot;,<br />and &quot;<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build</a>&quot; now points to &quot;<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtain.firmware.compile">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtai … re.compile</a>&quot;, so I guess that this<br />issue was already understood and documentation is being rewritten accordingly. That&#039;s great!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>razvan</strong> on 16 Aug 2011, 10:19)</p>

					<p>thanks for the post! I haven&#039;t been in the forums for a while, is Buildroot new? I guess I missed it when I was looking for the trunk ar71xx Imagebuilder. I too have a Buffalo WZR-HP-AG300H and am happy I can build from source, but surprised I missed it if its been around for a while....</p>									</div>

					<p>The WEB GUI Firmware upgrade no longer works for my Netgear <a href="http://support.netgear.com/app/products/model/a_id/2598">WGT634U</a> router for the past few upgrades. My last upgrade (two weeks ago) was done using the <em>sysupgrade</em> utility through an SSH login with a .trx firmware.</p>									</div>
