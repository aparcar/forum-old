					<p>Hi,</p><p>because python and mercurial are very big, I booted my Asus Wl-500g deluxe from a usb-flash-drive using this: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/KamikazeConfiguration/PackagesOnExternalMediaHowTo">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Kam â€¦ MediaHowTo</a> . I didn&#039;t know that it was so easy because I tried other solutions for getting more storage space before which worked not as good, btw.</p><p>I installed mercurial by typing &quot;opkg install mercurial&quot;. But when I want to use it e.g. executing &quot;hg --help&quot; I get the following error:</p><p>root@OpenWrt:~# hg --help<br />Traceback (most recent call last):<br />&nbsp; File &quot;/usr/bin/hg&quot;, line 11, in &lt;module&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; from mercurial import demandimport; demandimport.enable()<br />ImportError: No module named mercurial<br />root@OpenWrt:~#</p><p>This CAN be fixed by setting PYTHONPATH in /etc/profile, but hg seems to use commands like &quot;ssh Openwrt hg ...&quot; on the client-side, but dropbear is not setting PATH-variables when using commands like this.</p><p>There are two solutions I can think of, but don&#039;t have the knowledge to do them exactly. One would be to make dropbear setting the PATH even at commands like &quot;ssh OpenWrt hg ...&quot;. The other one would be making python find the modules without using PYTHONPATH, which is the one I prefer at the moment.</p><p>I think I have to fiddle around with the first line of hg which starts with #!/usr/bin/python to give python via an option the PYTHONPATH. But at the moment the python interpreter gives me just errors at everything I try <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>

					<p>A little investigation had shown me that python searches only in /usr/lib/python2.5 for modules. hg resists in /usr/lib/python2.4 . A little symlinking made it work. But now it seems that mercurial is broken ;_;<br />please message me if you have a working mercurial.</p>									</div>

					<p>Same problem here. I can successfully run hg when I&#039;m logged in because I&#039;ve set PATH and PYTHONPATH to the external usb drive where mercurial and python are installed.<br />However, I can&#039;t remotely manage the repo because dropbox doesn&#039;t set the environmental variables:</p><p>$ hg clone . ssh://user@my_openwrt_box/my_repo<br />ash: hg: not found<br />abort: could not create remote repo!</p><p>In effect, I can&#039;t remotely run any command...</p><p>$ ssh user@my_openwrt_box &#039;python -V&#039;<br />ash: python: not found</p><p>...without setting the path...</p><p>$ ssh user@my_openwrt_box &#039;export PATH=/mnt/usbdrive/usr/bin;python -V&#039;<br />Python 2.5.4</p><p>So the question is....... does anyone know how to set the environment for dropbox remote commands?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>xeper</strong> on 19 Apr 2012, 21:23)</p>
