					<p>If may be a question of asyncronous starting of network and other init scripts, or other timing issues. If you search for previous discussions for problems with /etc/rc.local, one solution that has helped many is adding a &quot;sleep 15&quot; (or 30) command before the actual commands.</p><p>I used the approach of having both a detached shell with &quot;(...)&amp;&quot; and a sleep command when I wanted to have the NTP-updated time printed to the log at the end of the boot. For me the sleep was necessary to give NTP enough time to sync from internet:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># Put your custom commands here that should be executed once
# the system init finished. By default this file does nothing.

(sleep 15 ; logger -t &quot;syslog&quot; - ntp client should have set time by now -)&amp;
exit 0</code></pre></div>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 28 Nov 2016, 12:01)</p>
