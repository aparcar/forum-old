					<p>Hi. Like your builds. But I have run into a problem, not sure if it is my router or I am missing something. Lately, when ever I reboot my router, I lose admin access. Usually several reboots may fix the problem, but the last couple of times I&#039;ve had to terminal in (also lost that) and reset the router. The router still gives out ip addresses, can ping the router etc. I just cannot log into the router any more. What am I missing? IS the router gone?</p><p>Also, the router is serving 169.x.x.x addresses, I can only get internet if I manually type in the info.

					<p>Know what 169 ip mean. I have done a full reset 3 times so far. Last two I rebooted after adding static ip for new hardware. Just when I reboot, I lose all access to the settings.

					<p>Hi, arokh! First of all, thank you, for making best fw for this old piece of hw.<br />And the thing why I&#039;m here is issue on latest builds, so there is a story: my ISP using L2TP with static IP for auth users, I&#039;ve easily solved this puzzle using static wan and creating extra interface with L2TP, but when I decided that I need all this updates and tor network (do it hard! factory update!), voila, while I&#039;m creating interface for vpn connection is showed button &quot;Install xl2tpd&quot; &#039;cause xl2tpd isnt installed, but, when I install it, the button wouldnt dissappear! And L2TP isnt working, I&#039;ve sshd to device checked all thing like depencies, routes, etc, but it seems problem is exact with Luci. <br />Could you give some advice? <br />Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>1. The &quot;vpn&quot; interface in my build belongs to OpenVPN, don&#039;t change that - add a new interface instead.<br />2. The l2tp config in luci (at least protocol installation) seems broken. xl2tpd is just a server, you most likely need openl2tp-full which includes client.<br />3. openl2tp-full is in the oldpackages feed so no binaries on openwrt.org download site (this might be why luci suggest xl2tpd i dont know). I&#039;ll add it but you won&#039;t see it until next build.<br />4. In the meantime, do some reading on how to set up l2tp properly <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>arokh</strong> on 15 Aug 2014, 12:53)</p>

					<p>First of all thank you very much for creating this build.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been using stock firmware on my WNDR3700 v1 for a few years and recently started suffering sporadic reboots.&nbsp; I went searching on Google for some better firmware and ended up on this thread.&nbsp; I was amazed at how simple it was to install and configure.</p><p>Now for my question.&nbsp; Is it possible to disable WPS?&nbsp; I looked around on every settings page, but haven&#039;t been able to find anything referring to WPS.&nbsp; It&#039;s my understanding that WPS is not very secure, so I wanted to disable it if possible.</p><p>I&#039;m currently using Firmware version r42165.</p><p>Thank you again!</p>									</div>
