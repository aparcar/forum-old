					<p>I don&#039;t believe so because the image files or .bin files are made specifically for certain types of routers to take advantage of their hardware.&nbsp; If your computer doesn&#039;t have the same chipset, lights to blink or ports to use than you won&#039;t get the full functionality out of openwrt anyway.</p><p>there&#039;s numerous packages that depend on the architecture of the router in question.</p>									</div>

					<p>White Russsian cannot be installed on anything but routers based on the Broadcom 47xx/53xx platforms.&nbsp; Kamikaze supports many more platforms including x86.</p><p>That port is mainly aimed at embedded x86 routers, but can run on computers too.&nbsp; Keep in mind that you&#039;ll probably have to build your own images (which requires Linux) with the proper drivers as your computer probably doesn&#039;t have the same hardware as the embedded routers currently targeted.&nbsp; Also keep in mind that VGA (monitor) support is disabled; it was working a while back, but was disabled in the move to the 2.6.21 kernel because it caused problems.</p><p>As with other installs, the serial console works, and so does ssh (though you have to use telnet until you set a root password.)&nbsp; The images produced by the OpenWrt build system can be copied directly to a harddrive with dd, for example: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dd if=openwrt-x86-2.6-ext2.image of=/dev/hdX</code></pre></div><p><em>Note: dd can be quite dangerous if you don&#039;t know what you are doing, wiping a harddrive is as simple as giving the wrong device node.&nbsp; /dev/hdX is used as the example because it is up to <strong>you</strong> to figure out what the proper device node is.</em></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Bartman007</strong> on 10 Aug 2007, 20:42)</p>

					<p>You may want to try one of smoothwall: <a href="http://www.smoothwall.org">http://www.smoothwall.org</a>/ ipcop: <a href="http://ipcop.org">http://ipcop.org</a>/ or m0n0wall: <a href="http://m0n0.ch/wall/">http://m0n0.ch/wall/</a> all of which are designed for using standard PC hardware as a router and firewall. These may be more suitable for your purpose. Good luck.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey, thanks for the replies...</p><p>I&#039;m currently running IPCop, and I do love it... The only problem I have with it is that it is not based on the 2.6 kernel and does not have IPv6.<br />I&#039;m not sure if smoothwall or m0n0wall does...<br />I was also interested in testing this out. <br />Thanks again for the replies.</p>									</div>
