					<p>After upgrading OpenWRT to r14066 (Atheros) and using opkg to install the ntpclient package, running ntpclient complains that it cannot load &#039;librt.so.0&#039;.&nbsp; A manual installation of &#039;librt&#039; resolves the issue.&nbsp; Looks like the ntpclient package does not have librt as a dependency.</p><p>Also seems to be documented and dismissed as not reproducible here:&nbsp; <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/4442">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/4442</a></p><p>-John</p>									</div>
