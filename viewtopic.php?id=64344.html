					<p>I just bought a Hootoo TM02 and am waiting for it to ship. In the meantime I&#039;d like to figure out the best way to switch configurations, maybe through the switch on the side of the Hootoo, or a Luci page.</p><p>What I mean by that is, there are a few different configurations that I&#039;d like to be able to easily switch between:<br />1) Home: Connect to my home network and act as a repeater<br />2) School: Connect to my school&#039;s network, act as repeater, stay connected when moving between access points, connect to my VPN (OpenVPN, SSTP, or Softether, depending on what I can get working) and keep it connected throughout access point changes<br />3) Hotspot: USB tether (or wifi if I can&#039;t get USB working) to my Verizon 5510L hotspot, stay connected to a different VPN, create wifi network<br />4) Client: Set Ethernet as a LAN port so I can connect to a wifi network from a device without a wifi card</p><p>So what would be the best way to easily switch between these configurations? Thanks to anyone that can help.</p>									</div>

					<p>If there&#039;s a slider on your router and you can poll its status with OpenWrt you may want to consider something like the config-switching script which was posted within the last few pages of the D-Link DIR-505 discussion.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks. I&#039;ll take a look at that. Also, I&#039;ve been testing stuff on my On Networks N150 from a friend, and I&#039;ve noticed that if I have an AP and client wifi settings configured (a.k.a WISP mode), then if OpenWRT isn&#039;t able to connect to the other router, then the AP network will be disabled. This is a major issue for me because I rely mostly on my iPad while at school so I can&#039;t just plug in an Ethernet cable and fix it. Do you know if anyone has found a fix for this?</p>									</div>
