					<p>I want to apply to AirPrint Server using DIR-825(OpenWRT Version is Adj.12.09).<br />and my printer is EPSON TX600FW that is can&#039;t support Airprint Features.</p><p>I connected this printer to DIR-825 Router by USB Cable.</p><p>I followed this article &lt;http://zed.0xff.me/airprint - printing from OSX &amp; iOS to Canon MF-4018 shared via WNDR3700&gt;</p><p>but, i had some problems.</p><p>I installed CUPS using Exroot, P910nd, kmod-usb-printer, kinds of packages.</p><p>but CUPS needs specified device driver or PPD File.</p><br /><p>Fortunately, I got a Driver Source code from EPSON Web Sites</p><p><a href="http://download.ebz.epson.net/dsc/du/02/DriverDownloadInfo.do?LG2=KO&amp;CN2=&amp;DSCMI=22586&amp;DSCCHK=f66a893c61091b7ddab36a0b9783a2597274f212">http://download.ebz.epson.net/dsc/du/02 â€¦ 597274f212</a></p><p>I already know It will be can&#039;t install before compile process when i apply to openwrt.<br />but it included PPD Files.</p><p>and I thought it will be work on ordinarily just add PPD file to CUPS system.</p><br /><p>Anyway, I connnected to http://ROUTERIPADDRESS:631 (CUPS for OPENWRT Web Command page),<br />added printer with PPD File from Driver Source Code.</p><p>but PPD File is not work because CUPS requested more files(epson-escpr-wrapper).</p><br /><p>So, I have a question about this problem.</p><br /><p>1. How to compile device driver(upper side&#039;s download link) and install to DIR-825 successfully?</p><p>2. How to apply my printer(TX600FW) to CUPS System?</p><p>3. How to set Environment Files for using Airprint Server?</p><br /><p>My english probably not correct.</p><p>Thanks. Have a niceday!</p>									</div>
