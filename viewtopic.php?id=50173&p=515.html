					<p>@Villeneuve<br />I&#039;m using 4.4.17 as well but I have NOT removed the revert-i2c patch.&nbsp; I also recall Kaloz indicating that was required for mamba devices to boot.&nbsp; I know some testing was done but you might want to try adding it back.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m trying to build Openwrt Daily Driver r49395, using the 4.4.16 kernel.&nbsp; I keep getting compilation errors due to the patches in target/linux/generic/patches-4.4/ not applying/failing.&nbsp; I&#039;m assuming that the patches are for a lower revision of the linux kernel and may not be needed, or already upstreamed, into the 4.4.16 kernel.

					<p>after being offline for work for nearly 6 months, I decided to use my holidays to flash a new version of openwrt (v1). As I also decided to not read the past 100 pages of this thread please forgive me if my questions already have been answered before.<br />I read the complete wiki-entries for WRT1900AC, chose the appropriate version of davidc502&#039;s builds, successfully compared all checksums and upgraded without keeping config-files.<br />As I started reconfiguring my v1 I realized different curiosities/issues:<br />- <span class="postimg"><img src="https://abload.de/thumb/statusudpba.png" alt="https://abload.de/thumb/statusudpba.png" /></span> : status tells me, kernel is 4.1.23, wiki states kernel would be 4.4.14. Possibility 1: the wrong (perhaps harmful) versions have been uploaded. Possiblity 2: the entry concerning kernel-version stated in the wiki is wrong. Possibility 3: The entry concerning kernel-version stated in the gui is wrong ...?<br />- <span class="postimg"><img src="https://abload.de/thumb/wifiuoq7m.png" alt="https://abload.de/thumb/wifiuoq7m.png" /></span>: No matter whatever I do (enabled/disabled SSIDs, /etc/init.d/network restart, reboot) - I cannot fully configure a single SSID, they won&#039;t come up. Is there any trick to do that?<br />- LED configuration: It seems there are only 3 LEDs preconfigured (WAN, USB2, USB3). I vaguely remember that in a previous version I had to change only one entry to get the LED configuration perfectly working but now there seem to be several entries missing. Would somebody please provide a copy of his/her /etc/config/system concerning the LEDs?</p>									</div>
