					<p>The hardware is very very similar. The WRT1200AC is considerably cheaper in the US, at least for a new model, so that would be my pick.</p>									</div>

					<p>It could be the 1200AC needs more RAM than the 1900AC. I&#039;ve been monitoring RAM on my 1900AC for about a month now, and it never uses any more than 25%.

Just speculation on my part. </p><p>RAM utilized on 1900AC since Saturday the 27th 2015.&nbsp; During this time it&#039;s gone through Gigabit file transfers, 600mbps downloads through NAT as well as nightly shows watched off Netflix, Hulu and Amazon using WIFI. </p><p>RAM% Used&nbsp; 27th-30th 10:pm<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://personalpages.tds.net/~davidc502/nat/RAM.jpg" alt="RAM Used" /></span></p>									</div>

					<p>Lots of manufacturers change the amount of RAM/ROM from version to version, but it&#039;s never clear exactly why because they tend to not add features and the stock firmware usually doesn&#039;t push the limit anyway. The Archer C7 did this as did the good old WRT54G/WRT54GS. I assume it has something to do with the deals the OEM makes with the RAM &amp; flash vendors. Or in this case, since it&#039;s being marketed as a high-end fancy router, maybe they just want to be the biggest and baddest spec wise.</p>									</div>
