					<p>Hi there.</p><p>I&#039;m using BARRIER BREAKER (14.07, r42625) on several WRT54G-TM (32MB RAM) (I got 4 in total, but only 3 play here).</p><p>First setup was:</p><p> ISPbox1 --&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;|-----|----&gt; SW1 -&gt; PCs<br /> ISPbox2 --&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;| BB |----&gt;&nbsp; SW2&nbsp; -&gt; PCs</p><p>This means WMAN3 was running on the &quot;BB&quot; which is the Brarrier breaker (and activated the ISP1 &amp; ISP2, cable and ADSL).&nbsp; This worked, for basic connections, and WMAN3 sort of worked, however, as soon as speedtest.net started from browser on PCs, the BB router rebooted!&nbsp; I do not have a serial console, and tail -f /var/log/messages didn&#039;t yield anything, this happened 10&#039;s of times, so I gave up <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><br /><p>Then it occurred to me it might be better to setup the BB (openwrt + wman3) after the ISP connection is established (each by a dedicated WRT54g-tm box), so built this setup:</p><p>ISPbox1 ------&gt; [RT2] -----&gt; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | BB | -&gt; SW1 -&gt; PCs<br />ISPbox2 ------&gt; [ RT1] ----&gt;</p><p>This means that RT1 and RT2 (both wrt54G-tm + tomato firmware), do the ISP connection, and act in &quot;gateway&quot; and NAT mode, thus providing DHCP connectivity to the OpenWRT (BB), and that guy in turn has a switch with all PCs connected to it.</p><p>It worked without crashes, but then I made some changes to the firewall and LAN rules, and can&#039;t get it working again <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>I&#039;m having hard time getting a valid configuration for the BB in this setup.. how does MWAN3 should look like? Is there a sample file setup for this?</p><p>I did follow: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/mwan3">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/mwan3</a></p><p>but that seems to be for the first-case setup (which was causing me kernel panics) where the BB does both ISP connections.</p><p>also, I&#039;m hoping to be able to put the RT1, RT2 and BB on same network, e.g.</p><p>RT1 ip: 192.168.1.1<br />RT2 ip: 192.168.1.2<br />BB wan ip1: 192.168.1.11<br />BB wan ip2: 192.168.1.12</p><p>then BB does NOT have DHCP or NAT or anything, just routes the traffic between the RT1, RT2 and the WAN and WAN2..</p><p>the firewalls already runs on RT1 , RT2...</p><br /><p>Here are some screenshots to help understand where I&#039;m at now, the FIREWALL:</p><p><a href="http://postimg.org/image/f7bseyv1f/"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://s29.postimg.org/f7bseyv1f/Screenshoot_73_01_Jun.jpg" alt="http://s29.postimg.org/f7bseyv1f/Screenshoot_73_01_Jun.jpg" /></span></a></p><p>I&#039;m not sure if this is right, I&#039;ve setup accept all ALL interfaces, because the FIREWALL already sits on the RT1 &amp; RT2...</p><p>This is the SWITCH view:</p><p><a href="http://postimg.org/image/fnyfawpcz/"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://s13.postimg.org/fnyfawpcz/Screenshoot_74_01_Jun.jpg" alt="http://s13.postimg.org/fnyfawpcz/Screenshoot_74_01_Jun.jpg" /></span></a></p><br /><p>This is the INTERFACES </p><p><a href="http://postimg.org/image/6tlb82ml1/"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://s2.postimg.org/6tlb82ml1/Screenshoot_75_01_Jun.jpg" alt="http://s2.postimg.org/6tlb82ml1/Screenshoot_75_01_Jun.jpg" /></span></a></p><br /><p>There are 3 players, LAN , WAN and WAN2.</p><p>This is for example how WAN2 looks like:</p><p><a href="http://postimg.org/image/86ltozq61/"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://s4.postimg.org/86ltozq61/Screenshoot_76_01_Jun.jpg" alt="http://s4.postimg.org/86ltozq61/Screenshoot_76_01_Jun.jpg" /></span></a></p><br /><p>I&#039;m ok with file based configurations, but thought this will be more visual for someone who may want to help...</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Stormy.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m curious how you plan to balance LAN traffic from multiple hosts between two different WAN connections without NAT.</p><p>Is there a reason you do not want to use NAT that I missed?</p><p>For this to work you would need to use DNAT (I&#039;m pretty sure) to rewrite the source IP so it looks like it comes from the CC router rather than the clients. I&#039;m not entirely sure how you would configure this properly though since it would be going out two different connections with different addressing. My recommendation would be to simply use NAT. It should still allow your PCs to connect to the upstream routers.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>arfett</strong> on 6 Jun 2015, 22:05)</p>

					<p>well, my naive thinking is that since the upstream routers, talking to the ISPs already use NAT, why bother with that &quot;overhead&quot; on the CC router?&nbsp; it just needs to somehow balance/send traffic to the &quot;right&quot; router based on &quot;session&quot; info? I&#039;m really not a network expert, all I wanted was a way for clients to still connect to the main routers talking to the ISPs (to be able to configure them), but I guess u&#039;re suggesting a static route will allow such access.</p><p>Also, I didn&#039;t want to load the CC router too much (DHCP and NAT), wanted to spread the load between the 3 routers.</p><br /><p>At this point I stopped trying, it was ~4 days solid, and couldn&#039;t find simple examples of my use case, so will re-try in a few months , maybe when CC release more WAN3 users will come online <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Frankly, I don&#039;t know how this is not a _hard_ requirement, for a small business, losing internet, is a huge deal!!</p><p>what i do now is simple:</p><p>ISP1&nbsp; ==&gt; Tomato1 RT1&nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; -&gt; PCs<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | SWitch | -&gt; voip, etc.<br />ISP2&nbsp; ==&gt; Tomato2 RT2&nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; </p><p>this way randomly clients connect/get dhcp from one router.. if an isp goes down i may pull the RT1 cable from Switch, and let the clients reconnect.. not best, but, worked now ~10 years <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Thanks...<br />Stormy.</p>									</div>

					<p>Personally I would just turn on NAT on CC and all your problems would go away then you could try other solutions later, if any exist.</p><p>This may only lead to the minor inconvenience of forwarding any necessary ports from R1/R2 to CC and then from CC to the desired LAN client.</p><br /><p>If you want to try it without then all I can recommend is make sure R1/R2 have static routes to the LAN behind CC.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>arfett</strong> on 7 Jun 2015, 02:48)</p>
