					<p>ring, if you cant get to the settings anymore, reflash it and start over.. its not a pppoe issue, dhcp should work fine, you should have mentioned earlier you were trying to connect this from a second router because theres a settings mismatch between your primary router and the openwrt router that was causing your issue</p><p>for pyther, you need to install kmod-ath9k to enable wireless, and you will need to install hostapd or wpad... either one is fine, and you can install all of these from the package manager in the hardware section under the system tab, and click software</p><p>i use kmod-ath9k and hostapd, but many people also recommend wpad, either one will work fine.</p><p>also, if youre going to use universal plug n play... ive found the miniupnp app doesnt work as good as the linuxigd</p><p>ive got samba file sharing and transmission running just fine, both running now, but ive never used the QoS feature on any router before so i wont be much help there</p><p>ill check out QoS later, if im unable to get my xbox 360 wireless N adapter working on my PC so i can get it to operate in 300mb mode</p><p>btw, if youre using an external USB hard drive for network storage, and want to use the ntfs file system (better than FAT)... install &quot;ntfs-3g&quot; and from the command prompt you will want to use the command &quot;ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /mnt&quot; or whichever folder you want it mounted to and this will give you both read and write abilities with NTFS... and of course, add these settings to /etc/fstab so you wont have to run the command everytime you reboot the router</p><p>as far as transmission goes, if you change the routers default IP address from 192.168.1.1 to something else, you will have to edit the &quot;/etc/config/transmission&quot; file and change &quot;192.168.1.*&quot; to whatever the first three letters of your routers IP address are, so for me i had to change this to &quot;192.168.11.*&quot; as i reverted back to buffalos standard hardware address</p>									</div>
