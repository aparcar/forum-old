					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have been trying to figure out a way to provide Internet access in a small office downtown where I&#039;m moving.&nbsp; The building offers managed IT infrastructure but the prices are ridiculous and they force me to use their VOIP infrastructure rather than my own Asterisk server for telephony because of potential &quot;congestion problem&quot;.&nbsp; The result is a is 333% increase in my telecom expenses compared to what I used to pay.</p><p>The new office is located downtown Montreal where the new Rogers, Telus and Bell <strong>LTE Networks</strong> have just been deployed.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t have thought using the 3G or HSPA+ network in the past simply for the high latency (150ms+) that can cause voice quality problem for VOIP.&nbsp; With the LTE Networks, latency is greatly reduced to &lt; 50ms which *I think* will be suitable for VOIP.</p><p><strong>My biggest problem is that I have no way to test this setup before signing a contract with a cellphone company</strong> so I&#039;m trying to get as much info as possible before committing to a solution.</p><p><strong>1. Companies only offer LTE USB Dongles or &quot;hotspots&quot;.&nbsp; I need a router with wired ports</strong></p><p>My first problem is that I need some kind of router to distribute internet to a fax machine, a computer, a VOIP ATA and a payment machine.&nbsp; Unfortunately, only USB Dongle are available at the moment.&nbsp; That wouldn&#039;t be a problem if I knew they were supported on OpenWRT/dd-Wrt but there is very little documentation on those new devices.</p><p>My first question is : Do USB Modem Dongle implement some kind of generic USB Modem driver known to work with OpenWRT/dd-Wrt flawlessly?&nbsp; If not, do some model do?&nbsp; Are USB Dongle said to be Linux compatible can play well with OpenWRT/dd-Wrt?&nbsp; Could it be necessary to create customs firmware images including more kernel modules?</p><p>Here are the LTE USB Dongle I&#039;m considering : <br />- Sierra Wireless AirCard® 313U (marked as Linux Ubuntu 9.04 compatible)<br />- Sierra Wireless AirCard® 330U<br />- Ovation MC679 4G LTE (marked as linux compatible)<br />- Novatel Wireless™ U679 4G LTE (same than Ovation MC679?)</p><p>Any advise on which one is likely to work out-of-the-box?</p><p><strong>2. Does anyone here has experience with VOIP over LTE or 4G wireless network?&nbsp; Any specific issues?</strong></p><p><strong>3. The connection needs to be reliable.&nbsp; Can wireless network be greatly affected by factor such as the weather or interference making the quality of the connection varying over time, even when the router is installed at a fixed location?</strong></p><p><strong>4. I&#039;m trying to get a hold on some Speed Test comparing the Telus and Rogers LTE Networks in Montreal... I found some for Rogers but not Telus (only Telus Toronto).</strong></p><p>Telus wireless network has a history of having better latency performance and I&#039;m wondering if this is the case for the LTE network in the Montreal region.&nbsp; If you have any info on this, please let me know.</p><p>I would really appreciate your comments and advices.</p><p>Fnk</p>									</div>

					<p>Its interesting problem and I think its perfectly possible to completely switch internet access to 4G or even LTE .</p><p>Ad. 1&nbsp; - LTE is a new thing and OpenWrt starts to support LTE modems. The problem lies not in OpenWrt per se but to properly switch modem to LTE communication. In Poland where LTE tests starts more than a Year ago&nbsp; and Huawei E398 modem is widely available, its fully supported in OpenWrt. As You provide 4 USB dongles names - search forums for those modems and find which one is supported and properly switches itself to LTE. <br />Otherwise those LTE modems act as standard 3.5/3G device which, again, is perfectly supported by OpenWrt but transfers are slower (LTE =&gt;3.5G=&gt;3G=&gt;2G=&gt;56.6kbs ;-p )</p><p>Ad. 3 - Main factors in connection stability is signal strenght - I think, the CRUICAL factor is distance from a cell tower. In my office Ive tested many configurations and few GSM companies and its always the same - the closer to CELL tower the better. The problem is that its not directly connected to signal strengts reported by modem. Its complicated problem but to make it short, during signal strenght fluctuation algorithms adapt various parameters making internet data flow to become interuppted to some extend. Anyway - Ive ended-up having an GSM operator Cell tower about 100m away and clearly visible by modem - this finally made my connection rock solid. Additionally, I dont see any fluctuations (earlier and now) caused by weather, time of day etc. Its not like WiFi where a person in a room interfere with signal.<br />Additionally - above information is valid for HDSPA. I dont have LTE yet so it can be different kind. From the opinion on internet, LTE by default is more solid and more reliable.</p><p>Hope Youll find a way to cut Your cost soon.</p><p>PS. - also: check if GSM provider not block certain ports,&nbsp; limit some protocols or use some kind of compressing technology. Ie. There are some providers which by default compress all transfer. In some cases its ok because you save some data but its not acceptable if You use 3G for professional activities. The solution is sometime to switch to alternative APN provided by them but You need to be sure its possible.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>janptak</strong> on 23 Feb 2012, 10:16)</p>

					<p>Thanks janptak for your answer.&nbsp; Really informative.</p><p>Unfortunatly, this forum, or the dd-wrt one, don&#039;t say a word about the dongles provided by my operators.&nbsp; In the meanwhile, I&#039;m trying to reach Sierra Wireless directly and will report back their answer on this forum.&nbsp; I saw that 3 or 4 people from Sierra Wireless submit code to the linux kernel for theirs devices (sierra.c and sierra_net.c) but it isn&#039;t clear if the driver available in the OpenWrt kernel 2.6.32.27 supports correctly the 313U and the 330U.&nbsp; Here is the closest I got from getting an answer :</p><p><a href="http://mycusthelp.net/SIERRAWIRELESS/_cs/AnswerDetail.aspx?aid=44">http://mycusthelp.net/SIERRAWIRELESS/_c … spx?aid=44</a></p><p>I&#039;m still trying to figure out that &quot;direct ip&quot; stuff the article is reffering to.&nbsp; I think it has something to do with the modem presenting itself as a network interface to the OS but I&#039;m not sure how that will work on OpenWrt.</p><p>I wouldn&#039;t mind buying my own dongle somewhere else if I knew for sure they where going to work in full LTE mode with OpenWrt and my provider.&nbsp; Again, documentation on which LTE dongles are supported on OpenWrt backfire is none-existent to my knowledge.&nbsp; If someone could report fully working LTE devices, those could be added to the wiki.&nbsp; I need something that works for the 700 MHz/AWS (1700/2100 MHz) and/or the 2600 (B7) MHz, AWS.</p><p>As I mentionned, LTE Performance is crucial for me, espacially for the latency aspect.</p><p>As for blocking ports and protocols, I currently use an SIP client on this network for &quot;long-distance emergencies&quot; (HSPA+) from an Android phone, so it should be fine.&nbsp; However, I don&#039;t know if new restrictions apply to the LTE Network.</p><p>Thanks again</p><p>Fnk</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>frankytown</strong> on 23 Feb 2012, 16:29)</p>

					<p>frankytown, take a look at the MOFI3500-3GN version 2,</p><p>It supports all the sticks you listed and they are very stable indeed</p><p>Many business users are beginning to go with this solution as LTE latency is very low.</p>									</div>
