					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I recently bricked my router during a reset and have since tried to unbrick it using many topics posted here and else where.<br />I was running manufacture firmware however I would be willing to put dd-wrt or original back on it. </p><p>The biggest problem I am currently having is when I connect via serial I get output but it stops immediately after using default environment and goes no further. It also does not allow me to input via serial. Any suggestions on what to do next would be appreciated. Thanks. </p><p>Below is the output I get on serial. </p><p>U-Boot 1.1.4 (Mar 31 2012 - 10:40:21) </p><p>AP83 (ar9100) U-boot 0.0.11 <br />DRAM:<br />sri <br />32 MB <br />id read 0x100000ff <br />flash size 8MB, sector count = 128 <br />Flash: 8 MB <br />Using default environment</p>									</div>
