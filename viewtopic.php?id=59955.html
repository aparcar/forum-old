Your 3g service charges for time connected rather than data used?</p><p>You could detect the failure of the primary wan using a script that regularly attempts to ping an external ip.

					<p>Since clocked connections may be too expensive (but the same applies to blockrounding on an always-on connection, if the session expiry is around 1 hour like some provider here in Austria does) to just let them run in the background, you will problably want to setup up dial up connection with a lower (numerical higher) metric.<br />I guess, it will be sufficent to set a timeout value (inactivity timeout) and a default metric.<br />That way, 3G will be used, when the other route is off an deactivated itself, when it is no longer needed.<br />You may still need to do some tricks in a cron job to take primary device offline or decrease it&#039;s priority (increase the metric), if it is obviously down - and test, if it is up again, to switch back.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>epek</strong> on 28 Sep 2015, 18:21)</p>
