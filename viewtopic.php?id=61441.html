					<p>Hi,</p><p>I got 3 router running the last version of OpenWRT.<br />I&#039;m trying to create a mesh network like this:</p><p>Client A &lt;-&gt; NODE 1 &lt;-&gt; NODE 2 &lt;-&gt; NODE 3 &lt;-&gt; Server</p><p>I try to implement this with the 802.11s protocol but i can&#039;t get it working.<br />I followed the instructions on this page <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/mesh.80211s">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/mesh.80211s</a> and it was not working at all.<br />Then i followed the instruction on this page <a href="https://github.com/o11s/open80211s/wiki/HOWTO">https://github.com/o11s/open80211s/wiki/HOWTO</a> and i was able to &quot;see&quot; the other node, but my client wasn&#039;t able to communicate with my server.<br />Does anyone have a good explanation/tutorial on how to implement a mesh network ?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Mark,</p><p>I&#039;ve recently set up a mesh using 802.11s and BMX6, Would you mind telling me what hardware you&#039;re using, and I might be able to help you out. My basic process (after using one of trondah&#039;s LuCi builds, here: <a href="http://luci.subsignal.org/~trondah/)">http://luci.subsignal.org/~trondah/)</a> is the following. Let me know if you need any clarifications, I just sort of&nbsp; threw this together. Obviously the part about ath10k is only relevant if your hardware uses ath10k. It sounds like you already figured out how to get the 802.11s protocol functioning on your device, so you can probably ignore that step.</p><br /><p>opkg update</p><p>(this is to install bmx6. If your kernel is older and can&#039;t use bmx7, replace bmx7 in the following line with bmx6)<br />opkg install bmx7 bmx7-uci-config</p><p>vi /etc/config/wireless</p><p>NOW replace the contents of “wifi-iface” after radio0 with:<br />config wifi-iface &#039;mesh&#039;<br />option device &#039;radio0&#039;<br />option ifname &#039;mesh&#039;<br />option network &#039;mesh&#039;<br />option mode &#039;mesh&#039;<br />option mesh_id &#039;OpenWrt&#039;<br />option disabled &#039;0&#039;<br />option mcast_rate &#039;18000&#039;<br />option mesh_ttl 1<br />option mesh_fwding 0<br />option encryption &#039;none&#039;</p><p>quit out and then:<br />(only do this if you&#039;re using ath10k. Sounds like you maybe don&#039;t need this)<br />vi /etc/modules.d/55-ath10k</p><p>replace the contents of that file with:<br />ath10k_core rawmode=1<br />ath10k_pci</p><p>quit out again, reboot, and then:</p><p>killall bmx6<br />bmx6 dev=mesh</p><p>and you should be up and running!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi zsherin<br />It&#039;s an old post, but there is not mush info on openwrt and bmx6.<br />I&#039;ve been able to setup an 802.11s network with authsae using 1 meshgate as DHCP server. It works, but not very stable. Especially when adding more nodes (more than 10). Although the MPs seem to be able to reach the MG, the MG cannot ping the node in return most of the time. So I was looking for an alternative and came across this post.</p><p>You have BMX6 running on top 802.11s working. When I try your instruction above it does not result i a working network. So I have some questions.<br />- do you use static IP(4) addresses or DHCP?<br />- How does your /etc/config/network look like?</p><p>I&#039;m using Atheros AR9331 based boards (/trunk/ar71xx/generic) for a sensor network. There are only MPs and 1 MG. No &#039;normal&#039; clients.</p><p>Thanks is advance.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Thedor</strong> on 29 Jun 2017, 16:21)</p>
