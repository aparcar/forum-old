I&#039;ve been doing a bit of searching for XB1 slow WiFi and you&#039;re definitely not unique, and there&#039;s a myriad of causes.&nbsp; Ideally, you always want gaming systems hard lined, however that&#039;s not always possible for the end user for one reason or another.&nbsp; The only thing that springs to mind is possibly electromagnetic interference in that specific wall or in your office/around your desk.&nbsp; That&#039;s such a dramatic drop in speed, it seems to indicate interference of some kind. </p><p>Ok... i missed something in your post.&nbsp; I need the exact settings values you have for your 5gHz network, as something isn&#039;t configured correctly if your only seeing a max of 17dB (max should be 30dB, or 1000mw [1W]).</p>									</div>

You may experience degradation of speed and or range by only dropping 1 dB, and if that occurs, I&#039;d recommend monitoring your router&#039;s temp at least once a day.&nbsp; That&#039;ll allow you to see where a problem is occurring and allow you to solve it before it becomes an actual issue.</p><p>There was a really good article I read a couple of months back that gave visual depictions and extremely detailed responses as to what increasing the dB range actually provides to the user.&nbsp; If I find it again, I&#039;ll post a link.&nbsp; You will almost always notice better improvement on the 5gHz spectrum by increasing the dB output, and will almost always notice a smaller improvement on the 2.4gHz spectrum.&nbsp; I wish I remembered what website the article was on, as it was aimed at people like us who prefer running custom firmware vs OEM, and was extremely well articulated.</p>									</div>

With it, I worked up something in a shell script that follows this pretty closely. You can download it here (apologies if the formatting/styling is weird, I&#039;m not used to working in shell):<br /><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jjack/openwrt-fancontrol/master/fancontrol.sh">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jjack … control.sh</a></p><p>It doesn&#039;t do any differential math for the 5 second temperature checks &#039;cause I&#039;m not sure how you&#039;d do that in a shell script, so I&#039;ve got it just looking for a 2 degree temperature change instead as a simple hack (the temperatures come back as integers, so a 0.5 degree check there wasn&#039;t going to work and I noticed that my temps generally fluctuate by about a degree every 5 seconds anyway).</p><p>As another note, while I added it in, checking all 3 load averages might be a little superfluous and could result in the fans running up 15 minutes longer than potentially necessary. Checking the 1 minute value would likely be sufficient.</p><p>It&#039;s got a verbose toggle at the top of the script that you can use for a little more output for debugging and testing. I tried commenting enough to hopefully help the non-programmers figure things out.</p><p>To run it<br />- download the script or save it to your router and be sure to &quot;chmod +x fancontrol.sh&quot;<br />- for testing and debugging, run it by hand with &quot;./fancontrol.sh&quot;<br />- if you want to have it run all the time or in the background, run it with &quot;./fancontrol.sh &amp;&quot; (make sure that VERBOSE is off!)</p><p>I believe that I have all of the logic in place, I just haven&#039;t had a chance to test it very much. Please try it out and let me know how well it works for you all.</p><p>DISCLAIMER: this is beta and might blow your router up and catch your house on fire and cause your cats to climb your curtains. But probably not. That would be really weird. I&#039;m not responsible for any damages caused to you, your property, or your pets by this software. But I will be really sad if something does happen.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jeremyjack</strong> on 21 Jun 2015, 07:10)</p>
