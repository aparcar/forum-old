					<p>Hi,</p><p>I recently got an old router from a friend, ea3500. I managed to flash openwrt using Wolftek&#039;s build openwrt-kirkwood-ea3500-pri.ssa since his build already includes luci.</p><p>I was able to access the router via luci.</p><p>However, under interfaces I changed it unmanaged and now I can&#039;t access the router. The router still works as a switch but I can&#039;t access luci to configure anything or restore it back from unmanaged.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>newopenwrt</strong> on 19 Jun 2017, 01:23)</p>

					<p>Can you be a bit more specific? Can you remember the menu option that you clicked to &quot;change it to unmanaged&quot;? Is this some special option that is only available in the Wolftek&#039;s firmware builds?</p><p>OpenWRT firmware images usually have a Dropbear SSH server running on port 22. Can you reach this server? If so, then you could use the root login to access the router, and restore whatever it was that you changed from the SSH prompt.</p><p>Since I do not know what exactly you changed, I can&#039;t really help you in restoring it either...</p>									</div>

					<p>I went in and changed the lan port to unmanaged. Because of this openwrt won&#039;t manage the port. No dhcp no static address.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried resetting it via failsafe but I can&#039;t connect to the router via 192.168.1.1.</p><p>My situation is similar to this one I found on reddit, however I can&#039;t get it to reset via failsafe so I can access it again.<br />reddit dot com/r/openwrt/comments/5miimg/locked_myself_out_with_turning_off_dhcp/</p><p>What happened was I accidentally made my router into an unmanaged switch. Now I can&#039;t reset it via failsafe or figure out how to set it so that it will be assigned an ip. Without being able to assign an ip to it automatically or manually, I can&#039;t connect to it to reflash the firmware or do anything with it.</p><p>The led on my router when powered on goes like this. It gives a green light then flashes very fast for a few seconds. Then the green light goes off then it flashes again very fast then a solid green light appears.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried resetting it via failsafe by powering the device off then holding the reset button during the first set of lights. I&#039;ve also tried powering the device then holding the reset button during the second of lights. If I hold the reset button with the first set of lights the led goes into a state where it just blinks very fast.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>newopenwrt</strong> on 19 Jun 2017, 03:31)</p>

					<p>If you turned off DHCP, but left the LAN interface otherwise intact, then you should be able to recover by setting a static IP address on your computer, plugging in the cable to a LAN port on the router, and then trying to access the router at 192.168.1.1.</p><p>By default, most OpenWRT firmwares set the LAN interface to IP address 192.168.1.1, netmask 255.255.255.0. So, by setting your computer to, say, 192.168.1.10 and netmask 255.255.255.0, you should be able to access LuCI again and fix whatever mistakes you made.</p><p>The same applies to the failsafe. When failsafe is on, the DHCP server on the router is off, and clients connected to the LAN ports do not get IP addresses automatically. You&#039;ll need to set the computer&#039;s IP address manually and then try connecting to the router.</p><p>If this does not help, then you&#039;ll need to get a USB-to-TTL cable, pop open the case of your router and connect to the UART pins on the PCB. Start up the router, access the console and fix the DHCP settings from the console&#039;s command prompt. It is somewhat difficult to do, but not impossible.</p>									</div>

					<p>I understand, that is exactly what I thought.</p><p>For some reason, I can&#039;t connect to the router either in failsafe or not in failsafe.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried both 192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2 (I changed it to this before I choose to turn DHCP off).</p><p>I&#039;ve tried connecting with the cable in the wan port, and in the other ports.

					<p>The EA3500 is one of the routers that has two partitions, for example if you&#039;re on Linksys firmware on partition 1 and flash OpenWrt, OpenWrt gets flashed to partition 2 and Linksys stays on partition 1. So if you follow these steps, you can boot back into the other partition that will still have whatever you flashed from and should be working - </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>1 Plug in the EA3500
2 Power led will blink rapidly
3 Power led will turn off
4 As soon as the power led turns off, unplug the router
5 Wait a few seconds
6 Plug the router back in and repeat the above process

Do that three times, on the fourth time keep the router plugged in and let it boot, hopefully you will now have a functioning router again.</code></pre></div><p>It might take a few tries to get the timing right of when to unplug it (step 4), so if you don&#039;t get it the first time, don&#039;t give up.</p>									</div>
