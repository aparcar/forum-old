					<p>Hello all,</p><p>I just was introduced to this and happen to have a WRT54G hardware version 8 laying around and figured it&#039;d be fun to play around with adding in OpenWrt.&nbsp; Has anyone been successful in installing the firmware and getting it to work on this version?&nbsp; Any tips/tricks or pitfalls I should look out for?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Neil.<br />KF4YBY.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>sadly this hardware revision only has 2MB flash and 8MB ram, OpenWrt does not support it (directly).<br />There is a DD-Wrt micro version which you could try, however the little amount of RAM severely limits the possibilities.</p>									</div>

					<p>make a wiki page for the router first and then try to compile your own firmware for it.......... reducing kernel size is the way to go...</p><p>from what I&#039;ve hear it has 16mb ram so it&#039;s going to be fine...</p>									</div>
