It looks like the router cannot pass (route) original Neighbor solicitation packet with local-link source address to the local lan (which makes sense). </p><p>I wonder if there exist, even theoretically, possibility to make it work. I understand that in &quot;normal&quot; scenario, both ISP box advertising router and local machine are on the same local link, so the ICMPv6 neighbor solicitation goes directly over the link to the destination and this should work.</p><p>Here however NPD steps in and it seems the packet either needs to be routed (not likely) or answered by NPD, which is not happening either. I tried two NPDs, ndppd, and npd6 and I do not know, if the packet is directly handled by kernel and does not even leave kernel to NPD, or NPD does not implement answer to such type of packets, but neither worked.</p><p>Any idea or comment will be appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>After some more investigation, I might be on something.<br />The NDP advertisements, which are ignored by ISP router, have IPv6 hop limit set to 64 (0x40), while those, which are accepted have hop limit set to 255 (0xff). Apparently, standard says, it should be 255 (0xff). So it seems like a problem is in 6relayd.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah the local /128-routes have a reason. If you have two /64-routes on both sides it is ambiguous for the kernel to which interface the packet needs to go therefore especially when the relaying router communicates directly with some clients on either side it is good to know where which client is (but it could also be disabled if you make a change in the /etc/init.d/6relayd).</p><p>The <strong>destination unreachable, beyond scope</strong> could maybe be avoided if you add some firewall-rules that block the incoming packets from fe80... to 2001... The 6relayd should not be affected as it catches the packet before the firewall but I&#039;m not really sure what the effect will be.</p><p>You can run 6relayd in RD-server mode while NDP-is runnign just set &quot;option rd server&quot;. It will then advertise all public addresses assigned to the lan-interface with a prefix of /64 or smaller as prefixes similar to radvd would. You can also do this with the dhcpv6-service. In this case your local dnsmasq on the relaying router will be announced as DNS-server for your clients.</p><p>So you can setup any conmbination of relay and server for NDP, RD or DHCPv6-service.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>CyrusFF</strong> on 9 Dec 2012, 18:25)</p>
