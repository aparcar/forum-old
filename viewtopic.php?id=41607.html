					<p>I am trying to do this too. If I am successful, I&#039;ll try to help. From this (<a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/32088">https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/32088</a>) it looks like the changes are now in the SVN, so maybe we don&#039;t need to patch.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>conn-fused</strong> on 11 Mar 2013, 04:30)</p>
