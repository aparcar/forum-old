					<p>I&#039;m trying to drive a relay with a 3.3v GPIO. From what I&#039;ve read, I could either use a solid state relay or use a NPN transistor and a 5v relay. I&#039;m no expert at computer engineering, so I was wondering if someone could explain how I would connect a transistor, relay and resistor (if necessary). I&#039;m also wondering what the exact specs on the parts I need would be. Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Connect the base of the transistor to the GPIO through a resistor (1k is a good starting value, 470R for more current). Connect the emitter to ground and the collector to the relay coil. Connect a diode in inverse parallel to the coil to absorb voltage spikes. Connect the other end of the coil to the power supply.</p>									</div>

					<p>There are reed relays with 500 ohm coils.&nbsp; I have some, but they are quite <br />old so I&#039;ve no idea where they came from.&nbsp; I have driven one of them <br />directly from 3.3v logic output in open-drain mode.&nbsp; You still need the <br />diode though.</p>									</div>

					<p>Have a look into opto-isolators. It will also protect your router from voltages in the circuit you are driving.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>R0b</strong> on 31 Oct 2007, 15:03)</p>
