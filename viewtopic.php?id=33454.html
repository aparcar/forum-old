					<p>Easy enough to do, I just implemented this for a customer&#039;s project.</p><p>On the OpenWRT box, you need to make sure you have all the necessary bits for USB sound (i.e. kernel module, core sound support, etc) that should all be described in the wiki/elsewhere. Make sure you have alsa-utils installed also to get the alsa programs. Once you&#039;ve got your USB sound card hooked up and confirmed detected and working the next step is to get a copy of RTPTools:</p><p><a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/irt/software/rtptools/download/">http://www.cs.columbia.edu/irt/software â€¦ /download/</a></p><p>You&#039;ll have to cross-compile them yourself for openWRT as I don&#039;t believe there&#039;s a package made for them (could be wrong though!)... I cross-compiled them since I was building a custom image anyway.</p><p>Then all you have to do is install the rtptools onto your device, and use a simple command line to pipe the RTP to aplay:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>rtpdump -F payload 224.0.0.56/6112 | aplay -r 44100 -c1 -f S16_BE</code></pre></div><p>You&#039;ll have to adjust the multicast IP and port numbers of course... and you can tweak your aplay rate/channel/format settings to match whatever you&#039;re using to generate the audio feed. In my case I was using the RTP send module from PulseAudio, and configured it to send 44100 mono in BigEndian format.</p><p>Best part of course is it works like a charm using almost no processing power (the RTP stream is raw audio, so you don&#039;t need to process/decode it on the openWRT box). I tested it on an old 200mhZ Asus WL-500gP and playback was flawless.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, I&#039;ll try it out. Do I need any special makefile for the CC? Did you use the openwrt toolchain for the CC and built a package from it? What did you use to create the RTP? ffmpeg?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tom</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>v1pr</strong> on 27 Nov 2014, 10:45)</p>

					<p>Jo, thanks for the&nbsp; good suggestion&nbsp; about cross compiling rtptools. <br />I need to do this for a project. The Openwrt-SDK successfully creates a .ipk package from the rtptool source </p><p>I installed it on a rt305x router with:<br /><span style="color: blue"> opkg install rtpdump_1_ramips_24kec.ipk </span></p><p>and run it with<br /><span style="color: blue"> sudo route add -net 224.0.0.0 netmask 240.0.0.0 dev eth0 </span><br /><span style="color: blue"> rtpdump -F payload 224.0.0.115/1234 </span></p><p>Normally this dumps the hex to the screen, but nothing happens on the router.<br />The rtp stream is visible from the traffic statistics on the eth0.</p><p>Were there any cross compiling tricks other than the special makefile changes.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Jim</p>									</div>
