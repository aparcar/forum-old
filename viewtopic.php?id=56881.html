					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have tried the early openwrt build from myopenrouter site and seem to be having a few issues!</p><p>The show stopper for me is that I cant change the interface address from 192.168.1.1 without loosing comms to the device.</p><p>I end up reflashing it, even changing it to 192.168.1.2 does not work. This is the same via /etc/config/network tweaks or the web interface. The next time it boots, all the leds are the right colours but no ping.</p><p>Any ideas what else I could try, or when there might be an &#039;official&#039; build that would be more stable?</p><p>Thanks</p><p>nick</p>									</div>

					<p>As far as I can tell the R7500 is not supported by OpenWrt in any way. The stuff on Myopenrouter is - code-wise - mostly open source, but more than that it is marketing. Netgear releases custom OpenWrt builds for a lot of their routers, but their official firmwares are actually based off old OpenWrt code since a few years (e.g. the official firmware for my WNDR3700 is based on old OpenWrt code).</p><p>Your best bet is to flash an official Netgear release - although it probably won&#039;t differ much from what you tried, besides some branding and maybe some extra binary blobs.</p><p>Hope you get it fixed.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Borromini</strong> on 17 Apr 2015, 21:28)</p>

					<p>OpenWrt on Netgear R7500 might be WiP with help of users having one unit.<br />see the thread for the R8000</p><p>Reasons:<br />- CPU/SOC is WiP / was added recently (ipq806x) - atm only a dev board exists - this is probably very similar to the real hardware<br />- its QCA so a little bit more source code is availble<br />- from the dual radio at least one should be supported<br />- Switch should be supported too<br />- usb3 (45345) should work<br />source for these is description at: <a href="https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Netgear_R7500">https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Netgear_R7500</a></p><p>a serial header is already available on board so only an adapter is needed for logging boot + other data from the board</p><p>first step for support would probably be posting bootlogs, content of nvram and possibly other stuff (cat /proc/mtd)</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Thanks for the advice. Reflashing with the netgear build worked.</p><p>Next I compiled &#039;telnetable&#039; which then gave me a command line interface into the r7500.</p><p>All the normal file/config changes worked fine. I even managed to load in and run a custom pacakge, although the network performance was poor.</p><p>Regards</p><p>nick</p>									</div>

					<p>As explained above, OpenWrt doesn&#039;t have build for R7500, you were *not* using OpenWrt.</p><p>If there is anyone with R7500 and serial console interested in *basic* OpenWrt support, please create a new thread with Netgear/DD-WRT bootlog attached and output of &quot;nvram show&quot;.</p>									</div>
