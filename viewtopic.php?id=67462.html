					<p>An unusual problem here ... </p><p>Suddenly yesterday (this worked every day for months with the same network configuration) outgoing remote desktop connections stopped working (only tested with one remote host since I only have that one to test with). This stoppage applied to all devices behind my linksys WRT1900ac OEM firmware. If I changed routers, networks (cellular LTE data network), or bypassed my router (connecting desktop directly to modem), my RDC attempt would go through flawlessly. I tried rebooting, factory resetting, power cycling ... nothing made a difference.</p><p>Anyways, that was the straw that borked the camels back so I successfully flashed openwrt (yay!!). But, to my surprise, the problem persists!?! I&#039;m pretty stumped as to why it would happen again given that I flashed a whole new firmware. </p><p>Any advice greatly appreciated ... this is driving me craaazy :S</p>									</div>

					<p>Derp derp ... sometimes writing things out is what you need to notice what&#039;s wrong.</p><p>I found a friend and connected to his remote desktop and that worked behind the router (which surprised me). Turns out, for some security reason (dynamic IP address at my end?), the MAC address on my router was blocked. Changed that puppy and everything is a working smoothly.</p>									</div>
