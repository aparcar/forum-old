					<p>Hello. </p><p>I have bought this [1] wifi antenna (21 dbi) to see and possibly (if open) connect to as many 2.4Ghz 802.11b/g/n networks in a small village (1km radius) as possible. I have used Asus WL-500W router with latest binary trunk Openwrt &quot;ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT (Bleeding Edge, r32647)&quot; and replaced the middle antenna with the abovementioned connected with 5 metres cable.</p><p>The thing is, when I place the antenna to the roof and connect it to the router, there is no signal gain, no more network shows up. Sometimes it even worsens the signal. I used airodump&#039;s PWR column values to measure the signal. I noted also that the PWR values are all negative numbers, usually from -69 to -90, sometimes -1. This is my screen [2]. </p><p>Am I missing something? Do I need more/another hardware to catch the wifis? <br />tx</p><p>[1] <a href="http://srvimg12.tetaberta.sk/images_tetabertask/251883_1_644x461/wifi-antena-bratislava.jpg">http://srvimg12.tetaberta.sk/images_tet … islava.jpg</a><br />[2] <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/63632916/Screenshot%20from%202012-08-13%2021%3A42%3A43.png">https://dl.dropbox.com/u/63632916/Scree … 2%3A43.png</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Slazer</strong> on 14 Aug 2012, 16:24)</p>

					<p>this is an directional antenna and 21dB is&nbsp; also a really high gain, so it will transmit a quite narrow beam (probably around 10 degrees horizontally and vertially), and it will receive only in this narrow angle. So only networks the antenna is directly directed to will get a stronger signal, all networks outside his narrow angle will be much worse. <br />So that&#039;s why you see less networks. And that&#039;s actually a good thing, because that means that less networks will interfere with your connection.<br />But directional Antennas are used to connect to other directional antennas (or at least highgain omidirectional antenna), so you have to point directly to the other antenna.<br />Directional antennas aren&#039;t the right wardriving equipment! </p><p>And you should keep in mind that the allowed transmit power is limited too. You have to check for your country but normally a ERIP of 20dBm or maybe 23dBm is allowed, which mean that you have to reduce the txpower of your wificard a lot. You will only be allowed to set it to (around) 5dBm to compensate the loss of the 5M cable, connectors etc. <br />But sending only with a ERIP of 20dBm over a long distance will only work if there is a high-gain antenna on the other side, to get a high receive sensitivity. </p><p>But as you are trying to steal (ok this word is too strong), but as you are trying to use the wifi of unkown parties unauthorized, I guess you don&#039;t care about wireless regulations either.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 15 Aug 2012, 08:52)</p>

					<p>@elon 21db gain minus 5db cable loss (approx 1db/m plus loss on connectors) will reduce the mean gain to 16db.<br />Bringing the router to 4db or less output will keep it in within 20db EIRP.</p><p>Mounting an antenna on the roof does not indicate wardriving - quite the opposite.</p><p>@Slazer: You need to set the correct antenna in /etc/config/wireless (txantenna 1, rxantenna 1) in the main section and restart the router. (or execute wifi from the console).<br />Keep in mind, that some routers are real mimo-devices (one antenna per stream), while others have an antenna switch, which connects two antennas to one stream.</p><p>txantenna/rxantenna values may vary. Please see iw info / iw phy phy0 info for all possible values.<br />0 is auto, 1 is main antenna, 2 is aux antenna in most cases, 3 is often diversity for two antenna devices.<br />Newer MIMO-devices may need other settings. Stick to the wiki.</p>									</div>
