					<p>Hello you guys. I am new to OpenWRT and have just gotten away from DD-WRT as it has failed to provide a proper method for the WRT54G3G router with a 3G data card. I went with OpenWRT because there is a <a href="http://www.evdoforums.com/thread6621-0-asc.html">great community</a> behind getting the 3G cards and this certain router and firmware to work together.</p><p>However, I have noticed that there are a couple of options missing in OpenWRT that were a little more relevant in DD-WRT. One of them is the ability to administer to the router remotely via a certain port (such as 8000) and the other is the missing page for assigning static routes to certain IP addresses.</p><p>As far as both of these problems go, I am learning toward the Firewall page being the place to make these changes, however, I do not know how and cannot find any documentation explaining how this is done. I have found something for White Russian RC6 for editing the system via telnet to add a static route, however this is slightly confusing.<br />My network scheme in a few short words or less is that I have 192.168.0.1 as my main router, and then another network 192.168.1.1. I have assigned my 1.1 network the WAN IP of 0.2, and am able to see the 1.1 network router config page by going to 0.2, but I cannot access it via 1.1, as I could before. Is there a way to tell the OpenWRT router (1.1) to direct all 1.0 network range requests to the 1.1 router? This is what I hope to achieve through static routing.</p><p>For using remote administration, is it possible to setup some type of port forwarding to allow the router to be logged into via the WWAN(see below) or WAN port?</p><p>Just off the record, if there is anyone out there that is using the same setup as me (Evdo Wizards custom build), is it possible to add a DynDNS (or the like) entry for the WWAN port, or is this just for the WAN port? I cannot seem to get my DynDNS account talking with my router...</p><p>If I am in any way unclear, please tell me to explain myself.</p><p>Thanks for your response, it helps! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>-Patrick</p>									</div>

					<p>Okay, perhaps I am not explaining myself clearly enough because I do not understand...</p><p>Here is what I want to do: when I am on the 192.168.0.1 network (say 192.168.0.103), I would like to type into my browser 192.168.1.1 and the next router config pages show up. I have not changed anything on the 192.168.1.1 router so far and it worked with my past setup. However, this was with the default Linksys firmware, now I have OpenWRT flashed to it. In default firmware I was able to set up a static route under Advanced Routing. However, with OpenWRT (with the X-WRT extensions), I am not able to assign a static route because there is no config page for it.</p><p>As far as physical media configuration goes, I have the 2nd router plugged into the first router with the WAN port used on the 2nd router and a LAN port on the 1st router.</p><p>Where do I enter in the information to be able to connect to the 192.168.1.1 network from the 192.168.0.1 network. Basically, where do I assign a static route within the router configuration?</p><p>Thank you for your patience with me..<br />-Patrick</p>									</div>

					<p>The static routes configuration page has not been created yet in webif2 for White Russian. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />Use this guide to create the static routes NVRAM variables <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtNVRAM#head-6811613ee2c1315294858674d91d3de5a0e21bfa">Static Routes</a>.<br />If I understand your current topology, you are sitting in the network of the first router and you are trying to go to the second network which is masqueraded via the wan port of the second router. There is no possibility to create a static route for the masqueraded network <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Everything you have is the 0.2 address, the traffic to this address is forwarded to the second network using the firewall.</p>									</div>
