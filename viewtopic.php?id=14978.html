					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;ve got a wrt54g v1.1 with the precompiled Kamikaze 7.09 firmware on it.&nbsp; If I have the LAN side connected to my main network, it takes about 1 hour and 8 minutes from the time I plug in the power to boot completely.&nbsp; Once the router boots (after an hour of waiting) everything seems fine.&nbsp; &nbsp;During the hour-long wait, the power light flashes in kind of a three-beat pattern, although it&#039;s not very steady.&nbsp; And the DMZ light is not on.</p><p>However, if I boot the router when it&#039;s not connected to anything, it will boot up fine in about 1 minute.&nbsp; Same if I have it hooked to a stand-alone switch with only a laptop connected to the switch - 1 minute and the router is up and I can SSH in from the laptop.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, if I boot it disconnected, then connect it to the main network, it works fine.</p><p>I thought maybe it was a link-level problem with autonegotiation of 100 Mbit on my main network switch, so I hooked the router to the isolated switch (which the router works fine with), then hooked that switch to the main network and power-cycled.&nbsp; Same problem - blink-blink-blink for an hour.</p><p>However, I did notice today that there is a rogue device somewhere on the main network that&#039;s using the 192.168.1.1 address (our normal IPs are in the 172.x.x.x net).&nbsp; Could THAT be causing the problem?&nbsp; Might the bootloader be freaking out when (or rather if?) it issues its first gratuitous ARP for 192.168.1.1 and gets a reply?&nbsp; And if so, why is it taking sooooo long to get past that and start booting openwrt?</p><p>Any suggestions or advice are much appreciated.</p><p>Dave</p>									</div>
