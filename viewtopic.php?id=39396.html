					<p>Separating interfaces using VLANS will be the way to go but you will want to first take the WNR-1043ND router out of the DHCP pool. Give it the address 192.168.100.2. You want to only use the gateway router as your DHCP server. On the gateway router, you will want to add a vlan for your guest wifi and trunk it through port 1.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the replies.<br />So, I connected the WR-1043ND with LAN1 to the Modem/router (instead of the WAN).</p><p>But now PC1 has a strange IP address. Clients connected to the WLAN GUEST do get a correct IP in range, but no access to the internet.</p><p>Probably I have to add a route or define a DNS? But I don&#039;t know which and how.</p><p>Can you help with with the next step? <br />Thanks!</p><p>Best regards,<br />Dre</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dre111</strong> on 17 Sep 2012, 23:09)</p>
