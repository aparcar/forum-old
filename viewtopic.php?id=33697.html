					<p>I compiled my new build Backfire (10.03.1, r29607) (synchronised with the latest backfire branch).</p><p>After several tests and and reverse troubleshooting I found that the reason for the layer 3 communication break are the qos packages:<br />root@Core-Sf:~# opkg list_installed | grep qos <br />luci-app-qos - 0.10+svn7969-1<br />qos-scripts - 1.2.1-3.2</p><p>Here is interesting - Layer 2 connectivity was confirmed, since i got arp replies and arping replies from my gateway and successfully got an IP address from my ISP.</p><p>So,<br />After restoring my backup I had no internet connectivity, so I started from the beginning, restoring first the most basic configuration and testing on every step. And I discovered that the problem appears when I start the qos.<br />I see modules for qos like imq, schedulers, etc loaded&nbsp; correctly.</p><p>Its strange, because the only package that I added in this build and that might have caused this mess is probably:<br />CONFIG_PACKAGE_iptables-mod-ipp2p=y<br />and probably:<br />CONFIG_PACKAGE_kmod-ipt-queue=y</p><p>After stopping qos I need to reboot the box and after that the l3 connectivity is OK, internet connection too.<br />Any suggestions?</p>									</div>
