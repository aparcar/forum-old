					<p>hi, </p><p>dropbear itself doesn&#039;t use a config file, run &quot;dropbear -h&quot; for the commandline option. </p><p>but the startup-script (/etc/init.d/dropbear) use the configfile /etc/config/dropbear.<br />and there are two options passwordauth, and port. <br />and it seems like you can use the port option, because there you can specify the address too. ( -p [address:]port )<br />so </p><p>option Port&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;192.168.1.1:22&#039; </p><p>should work. </p><p>if it does not, you should try starting it from the command line, and adapt the startupscript.</p><p>if nothing works, you can restrict the access with firewallrules, or you can install openssh-server if you need a fullfeatured ssh-server.</p>									</div>

					<p>thanks for your reply,</p><p>i&#039;ve put it in the config file and restarted the dropbear service - now i even can&#039;t connect from local lan, meaning something went wrong / configuring this by config file doesn&#039;t work...<br />seems like somebody only did half things ):<br />will use the emergeny telne tserver or reflash by tftp and then try modding the parameters.<br />i just can&#039;t understand why the ssh server by default is reachable from everywhere ):</p>									</div>

					<p>the ssh-server is not available from everywhere, only from the lan-side. <br />per default all inboundtraffic from the wanside is blocked by the firewall. you have to open port 22 if you want to reach the sshserver from the wanside. <br />it is maybe confusing, that the sshserver is reachable on the wanip from the lanside, but the firewall blocks traffic coming to a specific interface (wan-interface) and not a special ipaddress (would be difficult if you have a dynamic wan-ip). It is important on which interface the package arrives the router, and not to which address it should go. if it comes to the lan-interface of the router it is accepted, if it enters on the wanside it is blocked per default. <br />so per default the sshserver is only available from the lanside (through the lan-interface) on all router-ipaddresses (also on the wan-ip) but not on the wan-interface!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 9 Feb 2008, 22:56)</p>
