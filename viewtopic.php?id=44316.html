					<p>I posted a question on the developer mail list regarding supported chipsets for ADSL functionality some time back. Daniel was nice enough to answer my question and advised among other things:<br />* To look through <a href="http://wikidevi.com/">http://wikidevi.com/</a> for device specs.<br />* That &quot;xDSL is only supported on Lantiq and TI AR7 chips for now. POTS/VoIP is only supported on Lantiq&quot;</p><p>Accordingly, I searched for &quot;lantiq&quot; on the wikidevi site and came up with 16 devices. Among these, the more interesting ones:<br />* <a href="http://wikidevi.com/wiki/Buffalo_WBMR-HP-G300H">http://wikidevi.com/wiki/Buffalo_WBMR-HP-G300H</a> (already known to work)<br />* <a href="http://wikidevi.com/wiki/TP-LINK_TD-W8970_v1">http://wikidevi.com/wiki/TP-LINK_TD-W8970_v1</a><br />* <a href="http://wikidevi.com/wiki/ZyXEL_PK5001Z_%28CenturyLink%29">http://wikidevi.com/wiki/ZyXEL_PK5001Z_ â€¦ uryLink%29</a><br />Am I wrong therefore in thinking that the tp-link and zyxel devices should also be able to run openwrt + adsl, or am I missing something?</p><p>My second question is, about the pots/voip comment: how does a router support or not support voip? AFAIK voip needs the FXP/FXO cards, which are housed in another box, with its own OS. Is it possible to install FXP/FXO cards directly on the router?</p><p>Finally, if I may suggest, an &quot;ADSL Devices&quot; page as addendum to the TOH would be most helpful - just a list of devices which have ADSL working under openwrt...</p><p>Regards.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Beeblebrox,</p><p>For routers with PCI, Mini-PCI or Mini-PCIe expansion slots you can plug in FXO/FXS cards.<br />For example...<br />Alix<br />Geos<br />Soekris etc.</p><p>Of course I would advise you to use hardware that is fully open source supported (no binary blobs)</p><p>Regards,<br /> - Guy.</p>									</div>

					<p>@guy.ellis: Who would have thought? I looked through some of the images of those devices and I see the pci/pcie slots. Those are of course large boxes, I was thinking in terms of the home/office breed.</p><p>Thanks for helping me get the concept right.<br />Regards.</p>									</div>

					<p>Some further digging shows that the Zyxel-CenturyLink (#3) device is country-specific so not worth the effort probably.</p><p>On the other hand, device #2 (TP-LINK TD-W8970) looks very promising:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/td-w8970">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/td-w8970</a><br />My thoughts are to focus on that device...</p>									</div>
