					<p>Hello,</p><p>I found out that after adding a self powered 3,5&quot; hard drive (via SATA-2,5&quot;-3,5&quot; -&gt; USB) to my HUB,<br />I got several &quot;connect-debounce failed&quot; lines in dmegs and USB devices started working erraticly (detach-attach a little later automatically).</p><p>I found out that this self powered 3,5&quot; hard drive is working like a charm in other conditions.<br />The power adapter of this drive is cheap Chinese +5 +12V type.</p><p>When I powered the HUB from HD&#039;s power adapter (instead of its own power plug) &quot;connect-debounce failed&quot; problem eliminated (when I plug hard-drive).</p><p>My theory:<br />- More (cheap?) self powered device together could cause &quot;connect-debounce failed&quot; if their zero points are not grounded together.</p><p>My system:<br />TP-Link TP-1043ND with Backfire (10.03.1-rc4, r24045)<br />- 1a40:0201 TERMINUS TECHNOLOGY INC. - self powered 7 port HUB <br />- 090d:1001 Multiport Computer Vertriebs GmbH - flash disk<br />- 0a81:0101 Chesen Electronics Corp.

					<p>... I have strange feeling like talking to myself :-)</p><p>Anyway if somebody will have similar problem ever, my &quot;problem&quot; could be a possible reason and I give solution also.<br />So I connected every self powered device&#039;s GND line together (which is connected through my USB HUB) and &quot;connect-debounce failed&quot; gone away.<br />GND here means the zero (ground) potential wire which goes to self powered device.</p><p>In my case I connected every GND point:<br />- 3,5&quot; hard drive (where power input is like this: +5V, GND, GND, +12V)<br />- self powered USB HUB (where power input is like this: +5V, GND)<br />- old HP DeskJet (where power input is like this: +16V, GND, +32V)</p><p>... and this solved my &quot;connect-debounce failed&quot; problem ever.<br />How did I connect? Just soldered them together with a wire.</p><p>BR,<br />Mark</p>									</div>
