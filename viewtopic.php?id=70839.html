					<p>WNDR3700V1</p><p>I have just installed the latest openwrt firmware using TFTP (prior to that it was using DD). The firmware install went fine. When it restarted, I was presented with a screen asking for me to log into Luci. It offers the user root. Now, according to this wiki-openwrt-org-doc-howto-firstlogin, it should tell me that there is no password, but it doesn&#039;t. Now, I have tried the following passwords:<br />- blank<br />- password<br />- root<br />- admin<br />None of these work.<br />I have re-installed the firmware - same problem. <br />I have used putty. It also asks for a user name and password and I tried the same combination as above - no luck. </p><p>I&#039;m having a sense of humour failure as if this is some Kafkaesque Openwrt joke...</p><p>Can someone please tell me what password I should use to log into Luci for the first time?</p><p>TIA<br />m</p>									</div>

					<p>Ta for the reply, but...</p><p>Re browser - done that - 3 browsers (Chrome FF and IE)</p><p>Re telnet: &quot;connection&nbsp; refused&quot;<br />Re SSH: it asks for a user name and password as per my OP.<br />Oh, and heading off your next question, the power led is fast blinking so I believe it to be in failsafe mode.</p><p>I can assure you that the password is definitely not blank.</p><p>EDIT: Is it just a OpenWRT bug maybe?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mossywell</strong> on 6 May 2017, 17:44)</p>

					<p>OK - I fixed it by installing the stock and then installing OpenWrt. However, this relationship is short lived because it seems that the 5-year bug of 5ghz still exists. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>viewtopic.php?id=37896<br />ticket 16543</p><p>Soz folks but I really need 5ghz working.</p>									</div>
