					<p>I tried to install openwrt on this router TL-WR2543ND.<br />I managed to succesfully setup WAN, LAN and WLAN.<br />After some setuping, router become very weird:<br />I couldnt ssh or http to setup it (kinda bricked).<br />It was connected to WAN and was DHCPing to local computers strange IP&#039;s (not 192.168.1. kind of).<br />Internet was working when I was connected via LAN, was not working when I was connected via WLAN.<br />Anyway I couldn&#039;t make any changes..</p><p>Then I tried to enter failsafe mode using this guide <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe</a><br />It was not working, however after some research I managed to enter failsafe mode (after switching on, one must rappidly click WPS buttom and then it was possible to ssh to router).</p><p>However here I was unable to re-set to sort of factory settings OpenWRT (command firstboot was not obviously working).</p><p>So, how can I reset OpenWRT when in safemode?<br />I don&#039;t mind getting router screwed up, unless I&#039;m able to get in via failsave, restore &quot;factory openwrt&quot; settings and then load last known good config. But how can I do it?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>..and one more additional question.</p><p>Is it possible to tie reset button of router to some action that would for example rewrite /etc/config with some predefined files?<br />meaning if I screw router up, I could replace bad config with good config.<br />is this possible?</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t know if it is the same problem but it as the least similar, on the same model: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39728.">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39728.</a></p><p>For me it some times failed to start correctly and only accessible through telnet but without possibility to change anything. Then after many restarts (including full power removal) it is starting to work. Anyway I don&#039;t mind very much because it is always on and the problem is not repeating very often.</p>									</div>
