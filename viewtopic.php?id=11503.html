					<p>Is it possible to have multiple SSID and WPA (on at least 2 SSID) with Broadcom?<br />Last time I checked it wasn&#039;t possible, any news about this? I&#039;m asking since I now see this working on dd-wrt..</p><p>Thanks for any input.</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s possible with both OpenWrt Kamikaze and DD-WRT (only v2.4 Beta).<br />The only one problem using both OpenWrt and DD-WRT, is Broadcom driver. Making a site survey using a Unix system, you will be able to see all your ssids. Making a site survey using Windows, you will be able to see just one ssid per time.<br />Typing &quot;iwconfig&quot; on OpenWrt, i just could see only one wl0 interface working correctly. About wl0.1 I could read &quot;No wireless extensions&quot;. But site surveying I could see that interface and I could correctly use it.<br />I think you can find some other useful posts using the search function on this forum</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ggp81</strong> on 5 Jul 2007, 11:05)</p>
