					<p>hi all, i am a happy existing openwrt user, however in light of the upcoming &quot;fcc lockdown&quot; i would like to buy a newer, more powerful router (i got a TL-WR1043ND v1.0) which of course must support openwrt.</p><p>any advice on what to buy? i need the gbit lan ports. looking for it to be &quot;kind of&quot; futureproof as far as hw specs go. currently, i think a DIR-860L or a WZR-600DHP2 could do, but i&#039;m undecided and open to suggestions for other models</p>									</div>

					<p>Bracco, I agree that you should stay away from TP-Link as a brand unless there is an overwhelming reason to do so. The lockdown isn&#039;t &quot;coming&quot;, it&#039;s already here. TP-Link has already issued firmwares which have intentionally done what they can to lock out modders. Their recently released Archer c2600 removed the level-shifter needed to make the TTL-serial port work, making console access difficult.</p><p>That D-Link DIR-860L uses Mediatek chips (not OSS friendly), and AC is only supported on 2.4Ghz. That doesn&#039;t look like a good router. On the up-side, it&#039;s super cheap and console looks easy to get.</p><p>You didn&#039;t say what your needs/requirements were. USB? Flash space? You did say you wanted 1000BASE-T.</p><p>The WZR-600DHP2 doen&#039;t support 802.11ac, so I&#039;d not consider it.</p><br /><br /><p>Since I don&#039;t know what you want, I can&#039;t advise anything. Look for Atheros/QCA chips for the best support. There are a bunch of routers based on QCA&#039;s recent chips (&quot;AC2600 routers&quot;). I am currently working on trying to get the TRENDnet TEW-827DRU supported, but it will be a few more weeks likely. There is also the Linksys EA8500 and a couple of Netgear models priced around $150 USD, though the Netgears are a bit more expensive (better hardware).</p><p>I am personally biased againt the Linksys 1900ACS and the modern Linksys brand for what should be well-known reasons.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jmomo</strong> on 3 Aug 2016, 11:05)</p>
