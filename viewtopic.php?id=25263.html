					<p>Sorry about the crosspost on General Discussion, but I feel here would have been a better place.</p><p>I&#039;ve compiled the latest revision of mt-daapd, a.k.a. Firefly Media Server for OpenWrt. <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/file/ymzn2wgz02n/mt-daapd-svn1737-openwrt-makefile.tgz">Here</a> is the Makefile, files and patches.<br />It works great on my DIR-825 B1 with both Roku Soundbridge and Mac iTunes.<br />The patches corrects a nasty problem with persistence of the songs database, but only for sqlite2 for now. I didn&#039;t test the playlist feature, nor ogg/flac decoding. In fact ogg, musepack and flac are not enabled in my Makefile.</p><p>Issues that needs to be solved:<br />- Using sqlite2, don&#039;t try to rescan your library on the first run the database is created, you will end with duplicate entries.<br />- Using sqlite3 the database is not persisted thru successive runs of mt-daapd.<br />- Numerous bugs and SEGVs when using the web interface.<br />- The config file that gets installed has to be modified for the server to run. The most important setting is cache_dir, that should point preferably to an external storage. This directory should be writable by user nobody.</p><p>Still the server is very usable and allowed me to replace my dead nslu2.</p><p>I also uploaded <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/file/0mmq1fztlnz/mt-daapd_svn-1737-1_ar71xx.ipk">the package for DIR-825</a> if you are using snapshot/trunk as myself.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello, <br />I am looking for the latest svn of mt-daapd (1696) as package for ar71xx routers (WR1043ND with OpenWRT trunk here). Unfortunately I have no experience in compiling stuff from source, so I am not able to try it myself. Has anybody the toolchain for package creation ready to make an mt-daapd-svn package?</p><p>The source can be found at <a href="http://nightlies.fireflymediaserver.org/version.php">http://nightlies.fireflymediaserver.org/version.php</a> . I had the svn 1696 version running on my uNSLUng box for some years without problems, I consider it as stable enough for daily usage.</p><p>Thanks in advance, Goemon GC</p>									</div>
