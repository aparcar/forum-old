					<p>Does anyone know how to recover from the following scenario without re-flashing? Is this just a known issue with yaffs2?</p><p>After getting errors about running out of (flash) space, I (expectedly) see output like the following from &#039;df&#039;:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># df -h
Filesystem                Size      Used Available Use% Mounted on
rootfs                   60.0M     58.7M      1.3M  98% /
/dev/root                60.0M     58.7M      1.3M  98% /
tmpfs                    14.3M    388.0K     14.0M   3% /tmp
tmpfs                   512.0K         0    512.0K   0% /dev</code></pre></div><p>However, despite removing some files that I had stored on the router, I still see &quot;Use&quot; at &quot;98%&quot;, even though &#039;du&#039; suggests otherwise:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># du -sh /
11.1M    /</code></pre></div><p>This has occurred to me several times, but I&#039;m not sure what the precise repro steps are. Most recently this occurred when I tried installing a package with opkg, and ran out of space during the install. I removed a large file I had on the router, and could see that &quot;/&quot; was back down to &quot;21%&quot; usage, but after rebooting the router, it was back up to &quot;98%&quot; even though &#039;du -sh /&#039; showed only 11.1M.</p><p>The only way I&#039;ve been able to recover from this in the past is by re-flashing, and I&#039;d rather not have to do that if I can avoid it.</p><p>This post looks related, althout it&#039;s quite old: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=13171">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=13171</a></p><p><span class="bbu">Further Details</span><br />OpenWrt version: ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT (Attitude Adjustment, r36088)<br />File system type: yaffs2<br />Flash type: NAND flash<br />Hardware: RouterBoard 750UP</p>									</div>
