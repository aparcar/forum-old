					<p>First, censorship is evil! Are you God to choose what is proper and what isn&#039;t? Not even God makes decisions for people!</p><p>Now to the topic. How do you want to filter? Easiest method is probably make an account at opendns and specify what kind of sites you wan to allow/deny. Then change DNS on openwrt to ask opendns instead of your isp&#039;s. You can also block some specific sites using hosts file. Openwrt has also very good adblock, which can act as a content filter, you can alter rules to your needs. There are many ways to prevent people from seeing what they want to see, but (luckily) there are conuntless ways to circumvent blocking <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

					<p>If you just want to block a few ip addresses (or just allow a few), you could use iptables. If you want to do some ad-blocking or something like that, I would use a proxy (like privoxy), which block/filter unwanted sites/content.</p>									</div>

					<p>I just want to block a short list of sites from being openable in the home network. I want to do it on the router because it&#039;s the most simple way.<br />In the stock firmware I could simply go to the appropriate part of settings, edit a list, and be done. Not so much here...</p>									</div>
