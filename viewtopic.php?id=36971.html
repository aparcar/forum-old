					<p>Hi,<br />We brazilians have this new Sagemcom 2764 vdsl2 modem router with crippled firmware in it. We are looking to develop a OpenWrt firmware for it. I was looking for dd-wrt but they dont support modems yet. I read in a site that there are a few modems supported by Openwrt.<br />The main reason for doing this is to remove the QoS settings that the ISP has set for the home network (because of the TV services). And who dont have those services, also get this useless QoS.</p><p>The Sagemcom 2764 has an Ikanos chip and atheros chip. <br />here is a nice pic among others:<br /><a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/26/sam0168p.jpg/">http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/26/sam0168p.jpg/</a></p><p>Some info about it:</p><p>system type : Sagem fast2864<br />processor : 0<br />cpu model : MIPS 24K V4.12<br />BogoMIPS : 330.13<br />wait instruction : yes<br />microsecond timers : yes<br />tlb_entries : 64<br />extra interrupt vector : yes<br />hardware watchpoint : yes<br />ASEs implemented : mips16 dsp<br />VCED exceptions : not available<br />VCEI exceptions : not available<br />K0 in write back : no </p><p>Is it possible to easily build a firmware for this device?<br />Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>facsi</strong> on 21 May 2012, 07:05)</p>
