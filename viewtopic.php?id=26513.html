					<p>Hi for all,</p><p>I have an Aztech router, DSL605EW, MIPSEL with linux kernel 2.4.17 (malta), is there any plan soon to support this router?</p><p>Actually, I need to make a load balance on the router but the multipath route, queu and filters are disabled, also TQL and bonding. Can I install the bonding package of openwrt on my Aztech router to enable the bonding?</p><p>Can any one send me the bonding driver and the ifenslave.o for MIPSEL and linux 2.4.17? I&#039;ll try to install them in the router to enable the bonding.</p><p>I tried to re-build the kernel on my windows PC by using MingW, Msys and OVP toolchain but it failed!!!</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
