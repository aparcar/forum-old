					<p>Hello hnyman,<br/>I&#039;m building Archer C7 trunk releases based on your build.<br/>Unfortunately in laste releases I found that DHCP protocol on WAN is not working. router is obtaining an address from the router of the service provider.<br/>My last working is 43292.<br/>I then built 43347, 43350, 343368 not working.<br/>I suppose can be the netifd version changed in 43346 or the change of kernel release fro 3.10 to 3.14 in 43344 - 43347<br/>Did you experience any problem on wndr3700?<br/>Can you please explain how I can build an old release so that I can catch the last working release?<br/>Thanks and regards</p><p>Sergio</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sergiosatellite</strong> on 24 Nov 2014, 22:32)</p>

					<p>hnyman, have you seen anything related to this issue:<br/><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/18497">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/18497</a></p><p>I&#039;ve based my builds loosely on your config, so perhaps you&#039;ve seen this too? My WNDR3700 ran flawlessly for a month (in continuous service) with r43427 (based on the 3.10 kernel), and this issue must therefore have&nbsp; been introduced some time between r43427 and now.

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m used this build for a while, and it&#039;s worked well. All clients get an ipv6 connection. However, I&#039;m a bit confused as to how everything works.</p><p>Windows clients get an ipv6 lease and can register hostname (so reverse dns works)<br/>Mac clients also get an ipv6 lease but do not register a hostname. Mac clients also seem to configure ipv6 with SLAAC as well, so I have multiple ipv6 addresses on mac.<br/>Linux clients (with isc-dhcp 4.2) do not get a ipv6 lease but still configure a ip, I assume with SLAAC.</p><p>Now I want reverse dns to work for all clients (so kerberos and stuff can work for ipv6). How come all dhcp clients behave so differently? Is this something I can configure on openwrt, or is it only the client responsibility?</p>									</div>
