					<p>Hey everyone.&nbsp; I have openwrt 7.09 2.4 kernel installed on my wrt54g v2.0.&nbsp; I have a web server that port 80 is being forwarded to but it seems that I need to configure both dropbear and my firewall to forwrad port 22 to that machine so I can do work remotely.&nbsp; I was reading th4e docs that I could find but it seems the dropbear server installed does not support all of the features and I was wondering if anyone could help me with the config.&nbsp; I tried just adding the -a option to forward requests to lan and set in my firewall where that should go but it seems that I would have to configure dropbear to send it there and just set the firewall to allow incomming connections on port 22.&nbsp; This is what I&#039;m attempting.</p><p>Instead of logging into openwrt and running passwd for root I copied an MD5 sum from my /etc/shadow file and pased it for root in /etc/passwd on the router.&nbsp; From what I&#039;ve read this stops the disabling of the SSH server and telnet server, although I&#039;ve disabled telnet manualy.&nbsp; I would like to have the router listen on port 23 for ssh connections to the router, using the firewall I am not allowing incoming connections on port 23.&nbsp; On port 22 in the firewall I&#039;ve set to forward to the ssh server in the lan.</p><p>From what I read on the net I would have to run dropbear to listen to both ports and forward one to another IP.&nbsp; Using this setup I can also use the firewall to disallow anyone to remotely log into the router without stopping me from remotely logging into my system.&nbsp; From what I read on the net I need to use the -L option which doesn&#039;t seem to be available in the openwrt version of dropbear.&nbsp; Will I have to download a fuller featured version of drop bear to be able to do what I want?</p><p>Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>Oh, and I don&#039;t even know what version of dropbear I have.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure I could go into the kamikaze change long and find out but the -V option was not included.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>WrinkledCheese</strong> on 1 May 2008, 20:06)</p>

					<p>You seem to be confused between destination NAT and ssh forwarding. If you just want incoming connections to port 22 to be forwarded to a pc then just set up your NAT rules to do that. You don&#039;t even need to change dropbear on the router to listen on port 23 if you are not going to allow connections to it from the wan. It does not sound like you need to recompile or even reconfigure dropbear. Also why did you copy the password hash instead of running passwd?</p>									</div>
