					<p>Hello *,</p><p>yesterday I destroey my TP-Link TL-WR2543ND router. First I had an OpenWRT running and then I flashed with the webinterface to DD-WRT. And then I tried to flash to OpenWRT again. The webinterface said &quot;upgrade failed&quot;. Then I did VERY STUPID THINK I tried to refresh (delete) the DD-WRT firmware by flashing some wrong .bin file (from here: <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Linksys_WRT54G2#Reverting_back_to_stock_Linksys_firmware)">http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Li â€¦ _firmware)</a> and something went wrong.</p><p>Now when the router is running, all LEDs (except power LEDs) are flashing continuously and the power LED is always on.<br />I think, the bootloader doesn&#039;t start up, because the router doesn&#039;t answer on pings, when reconnecting the power supply. Before I flashed the router it did answer on pings. I already tried: <br />-30/30/30 - nothing<br />-fail save - nothing<br />-serial recovery (I have DKU-5 cable) - i can&#039;t connect with device via PuTTy (tried 115200 8n1) - only I had on terminal screen were unreadable symbols and also in that case, I had connected network cable with my notebook</p><p>Has anyone an idea how I could reanimate the router?</p><p>Thank you so much.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>raduzsvk</strong> on 30 Apr 2013, 17:48)</p>

					<p>Hi Lorenzo,</p><p>no I didn&#039;t. I tried several cables (homemade, from shop), but without effect. So I decide to sent it back to the shop for claim and they accept it so they sent me back the newer version of TP-Link router (TP-Link 3500). :-) I was lucky.</p><p>I am sorry, that I can&#039;t help you.</p><p>Good luck.</p><br /><p>Regards<br />Raduz</p>									</div>
