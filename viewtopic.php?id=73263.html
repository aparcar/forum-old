					<p>hello to all, I have a tp link wr740n and I want to fix it, it happened to brick it, my opinion I think the bootloader is corrupted, when I connect it does not turn on all the leds, only the power and the last two lock and internet I mentioned that the last two LED lights are very weak, I plugged a usb-ttl ch340g at the serial port and did not go in putty does not appear anything, how can I repair it?</p><p>Please tell me if it can be repaired with a BIOS ch341a (SOIC8)</p><p>the last time it worked, I was talking to someone on the messenger, and the router restarted and so I stayed waiting for an answer as soon as possible!</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes you can rewrite the bootloader with a CH341 based programmer.&nbsp; If that is the problem.&nbsp; Did it brick because you tried to flash something?</p>									</div>

I read on a forum that she needs the art too!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>laurentiu340</strong> on 15 Feb 2018, 17:55)</p>
