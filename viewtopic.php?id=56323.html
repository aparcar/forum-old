					<p>Hi,</p><p>Since the snapshot trunk, I got some problems with my Atheros AR9580 802.11an Chip. I can&#039;t set it to 30dBm (1000 mW), with the release of BarrierBreaker, it worked, since Chaos Calmer (r44797) not anymore. I can set it only to 21dBm.</p><p>Any help for me? </p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>The GUI might not have filtered out impossible userpresets in the past, but that doesn&#039;t means the device has actually transmitted at those power levels before. Regardless of what you configure, the hardware of your router has its own (hard) limits - which are somewhere between 17-20 dBm for the TL-WDR4300 (likewise are the regulatory domain ranges).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>slh</strong> on 17 Mar 2015, 22:42)</p>
