					<p>Hi,</p><p>It is my understanding (from forum searches here) there there were bugs related to WDS in Kamikaze 7.06.&nbsp; I tried the latest build (July 20, from nbd&#039;s area) of 7.07 and WDS does work without encryption.&nbsp; However, whenever I enable _any_ encryption (I&#039;ve tried psk, psk2, and wep) the WDS link breaks.</p><p>Please keep in mind that I changed only two lines on each router in /etc/config/wireless --<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option encryption ${psk, psk2, wep}<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option key&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;my-password&quot;</p><p>when they are commented out, everything works and WDS is established.&nbsp; When I re-enable them -- and they are pasted verbatim into each configuration file -- it breaks WDS.</p><p>Please understand that I&#039;m not asking for a fix, or even a timeline.&nbsp; I just want to know if this _should_ work, or if it is a known issue.&nbsp; Forum posts in my searches are inconclusive, but I see reports from people who say it works so I&#039;m not sure.</p><p>Thanks for your great work with OpenWRT and Kamikaze!</p>									</div>

					<p>It appears that, according to dev.openwrt, this has not been corrected? It&#039;s strange considering there is even a good fix (in the link provided by placebo). It&#039;s kind of odd that it didn&#039;t make it into 707, of may not even make it into 708 considering it wasn&#039;t changed yet. Is there any reason why? Seems clean enough.</p>									</div>
