					<p>I am just curious why U R so into a Fonera 2.0g. Is it because of its USB2 port? If so, what is your applications to use this device?</p><p>To run a Linux embedded system, perhaps a better hardware is this <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org">RaspBerry Pi</a>. Not only it is inexpensive and very affordable, but also a much powerful system. With a 3G / 4G USB WiFi dongle, this device can be turned into a router, too.</p>									</div>
