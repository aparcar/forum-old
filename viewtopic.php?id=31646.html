					<p>I am running Backfire on a D-Link DIR-615 rev E3.&nbsp; I am trying to use OpenWrt as a client to an Access Point (AP) that is sometimes near me but not always.&nbsp; I also want the router to be an AP for a wired network it shares with others in the area.</p><p>Everything works fine when the client mode is connected, but when the client disconnects, the router stops sharing its AP.&nbsp; Is this related to powersave (ie.&nbsp; the router thinks that since the client is down that the AP should be down)?</p><p>I noticed that power save was enabled on the AP&#039;s interface:</p><p># iw wlan0 get power_save<br />Power save: on</p><p>But I could not turn it off:<br /># iw wlan0 set power_save off<br />command failed: Operation not supported (-122)</p><p>I am able to alter the power_save mode of the client, but it doesn&#039;t fix the problem or alter the reading wlan0&#039;s power_save value.</p><p>So, two questions:<br />1.&nbsp; Is this really a power save issue?&nbsp; If not, please give me some ideas what is wrong.<br />2.&nbsp; Is there some way to disable power save?</p>									</div>

					<p>Run an init script or cron job to scan the air and detect the client connection and add/remove the sta interface with &quot;uci&quot; and &quot;wifi&quot; commands. I&#039;m working on a modified MagicConnect awk script which will try to connect to the strongest signal available. It&#039;s going to take a while because MagicConnect also doesn&#039;t take care of the disconnected sta situation.</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=30896">OpenWrt / enabling / disabling individual vlans on wifi</a><br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27401">OpenWrt / Why can&#039;t scan AP?</a><br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=22427">OpenWrt / MagicConnect - connect to open APs</a><br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=21636">OpenWrt / Announcing AAP (aka AutoAP) for OpenWrt Kamikaze 8.09+</a><br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=26116">OpenWrt / Atheros only! - Next Generation Piranha firmware (v4) + AAP (v3)</a></p>									</div>
