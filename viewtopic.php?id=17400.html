					<p>Hi</p><p>I need to access the Compact Flash on the Avila board. The driver modules availlable (kmod-ide-core,etc) are not being compiled even though I&#039;ve selected them.<br />I went as far (using both make menuconfig config and/or make kernel_menuconfig, followed by make clean;make V=99) as un-selecting all other drivers and then <br />enable one-by-one interchangeably, the other drivers were compiled except for the IDE. </p><p>I&#039;d appreciate any pointers to getting this right.</p><p>Regards<br />//Socrates</p>									</div>
