					<p>My goal is to use the sysupgrade script to flash a Compex wp543 board. I believe that sysupgrade needs a .bin file to do the upgrade.<br />When I build the OpenWrt code base for this target, the build seems to be good and several files are generated in the bin directory. E.g.&nbsp; <br />openwrt-ar71xx-generic-wpj35-squashfs-factory.img<br />openwrt-ar71xx-generic-root.squashfs<br />openwrt-ar71xx-generic-root.squashfs-64k<br />openwrt-ar71xx-generic-rootfs.tar.gz<br />openwrt-ar71xx-generic-vmlinux-lzma.elf<br />openwrt-ar71xx-generic-uImage-lzma.bin<br />openwrt-ar71xx-generic-uImage-gzip.bin<br />openwrt-ar71xx-generic-vmlinux.gz<br />openwrt-ar71xx-generic-vmlinux.lzma<br />openwrt-ar71xx-generic-vmlinux.bin<br />openwrt-ar71xx-generic-vmlinux.elf</p><p>I&#039;m expecting to see a bin file such as openwrt-ar71xx-wp543-squashfs.bin in the bin directory, but there is no such file?</p><p>Anyone know where I should be looking to understand how this gets generated? <br />Or, what I should do to generate the .bin file?</p>									</div>

					<p>Most likely answer is that you selected too many packages. The wiki should really mention this. Comes up quite often and I&#039;ve experienced and asked the same question when I tried to build my first image.</p>									</div>

					<p>The .bin file required to use sysupgrade should&#039;ve been generated during the build process. I.e. I&#039;m building my own image and do not want to use dd to copy it off an existing unit.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried reducing packages during the build, but it made no difference.</p><p>After further investigation it seems like:<br /> -Compex uses their own boot loader called &quot;myloader&quot;<br /> -During the build process they use a tool called mkmylofw to generate the .bin files (specific for their bootloader I assume)<br /> -With this product (wp543) it seems like they&#039;re generating an .img file instead of a .bin file<br /> -I then tried using the .img file to do an sysupgrade, but got the following message:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sysupgrade is not yet supported on wp543.&quot;</p>									</div>

					<p>Like I understand you use OpenWRT SDK downloaded from Compex, then you selected wrong board, because it created img file for wpj35.<br />Compex img by default haven&#039;t upgrade support.

					<p>Thank you, I&#039;ve noticed that I had the wrong board selected at one point and rectified that.</p><p>I understand the tftp option, which is available for 5 seconds when booting, but this is not helping me. I need the ability to do a remote upgrade (i.e. I do not have physical access to the unit). Also the unit may be on a different type of network, which would not allow traffic for a 192.168.168.x address and submask.</p>									</div>
