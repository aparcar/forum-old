					<p>The how-to shows how to setup OpenVPN on Asus WL-500G Premium (Kamikaze 7.09) configured as LAN client (no WAN and WiFi disabled).</p><p>This guide shows how to setup an internet gateway being accessible from outside of your LAN (via ADSL Router) to &quot;tunnelize&quot; all the client traffic via remote internet connection.</p><p>The pourpose of this solution is aimed to &quot;roadwarriors&quot; to bypass certain restrictions applied by the client carrier (example: mobile connectivity behind a proxy/nat; or a &quot;hotel&quot; connection opened to only web traffic; etc.) using a tunnel built on a &quot;almost sure&quot; open route (in the example: port 443/TCP used by the HTTPS service).</p><p>The guide is specific for certain hardware (Asus WL-500G Premium as server and, Windows Mobile 6 device as client, Mobile Carrier with proxy connectivity) but it may be adjusted to suit different necessities. It also uses a phisical &quot;bridge&quot; b/w the router ethernet switch and the virtual tap0 OpenVPN device, a different (more complicate, but also more versatile) would be to manage with routing tables to obtain the same result separating the two network (routing the whole traffic via internet wouldn&#039;t been the best solution in certain situations). It is even possible to adapt it to WLAN usage or WAN routing, but i prefeer to have a dedicated device for this pourpose (the traffic over the tunnel may keep some big CPU cycles if you use HSDPA).</p><p>This solution does not only route the traffic outside, it gave also the possibility to access to your LAN remotely (basic OpenVPN configuration).</p><p>The guide is not yet completed (the client part will be added asap), and it may contains some errors (i wrote it by memory, since i have no time to replicate it step by step atm), if you spot (small or big) mistakes please let me know so i will correct em. It also lacks of images (i&#039;m lazy).</p><p>The guide is available here: <a href="http://arctic-things.blogspot.com/2008/01/internet-gateway-openvpn-openwrt-on.html">http://arctic-things.blogspot.com/2008/ â€¦ rt-on.html</a></p><p>@Moderators: if i need to copy/past it here because an external link is not allowed, please lemme know.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ARCTiC</strong> on 17 Jan 2008, 22:45)</p>
