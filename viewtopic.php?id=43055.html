					<p>I would like to use an SDK from Attitude Adjustment 12.09-rc (OpenWrt-SDK-brcm47xx-for-linux-i486-gcc-4.6-linaro_uClibc-0.9.33.2) to build a single package. So I extract the SDK and link the package&#039;s directory into the SDK&#039;s &#039;package&#039; directory.</p><p>While the results seem ok, every make will tell me that the onfiguration is out of sync, and that I should run make menuconfig, oldconfig or defconfig, e.g.:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>malte@spiro:~/openwrt/attitude_adjustment/12.09-rc1/sdk-brcm47xx$ make package/bro/download V=s
Collecting package info: done
WARNING: your configuration is out of sync. Please run make menuconfig, oldconfig or defconfig!
...</code></pre></div><p>Why? Isn&#039;t the configuration stored in .config? But that&#039;s part of the SDK already.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried oldconfig and defconfig. Both result in a very small .config file. With that, the build does not work anymore:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>malte@spiro:~/openwrt/attitude_adjustment/12.09-rc1/sdk-brcm47xx$ make package/bro/download V=s

make[2]: *** [scripts/config/mconf] Error 2

					<p>The best way to solve the problem you have encountered is to get the Attitude Adjustment 12.09-rc buildroot source and select the package you want to build. This way, the build process will build everything needed to compile the package. Sure it takes time; however, it will solve a whole lot of other issues.</p>									</div>

					<p>That error message is misleading and wrong in the SDK case. Since everything is precompiled you cannot run oldconfig.<br />You need to restore the .config from the archive and ignore the warning from then on.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks to both of you. I have added <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtain.firmware.sdk#compile.packages">a note about this</a> to the SDK wiki page. And I&#039;ll try the buildroot to find out whether it will resolve a compilation issue I have.</p><p>How do I use defconfig and oldconfig with the OpenWrt buildroot?</p>									</div>
