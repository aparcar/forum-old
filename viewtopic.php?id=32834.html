					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am looking for some help on getting a programming language to read the serial port.</p><p>Desired end result:<br />A deamon that fills a DB with key-&gt;value pairs from the serial port.</p><p>background:<br />I am using a&nbsp; number of Arduino based Jeenodes to power my home automation (heating system, sprinklers, wind turbine, etc)<br />I would like to do analysis on what&#039;s happening to improve.</p><p>I started with a pc (ubuntu linux) based setup which I would the like to replicate on my Linksys WRT160NL-EZ.</p><p>First try: php, not really suited to grab every relevant serial message, can just do polling. I have seen some interfaces with C programs but that doesn&#039;t feel right.<br />Then I looked at Ruby, which worked very simple on the PC:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>require &quot;rubygems&quot;
require &quot;serialport&quot;
require &quot;sqlite3&quot;

# Open a database
db = SQLite3::Database.new &quot;test.db&quot;

# Create a database
#rows = db.execute &lt;&lt;-SQL
#  create table readings (
#    id varchar(30),
#    val int
#  );
#SQL

#params for serial port
port_str = &quot;/dev/ttyUSB0&quot;  #may be different for you
baud_rate = 57600
data_bits = 8
stop_bits = 1
parity = SerialPort::NONE

sp = SerialPort.new(&quot;/dev/ttyUSB1&quot;, 57600, data_bits, stop_bits, parity)

#wait for entire byte to come in
sp.read_timeout = 0

puts &quot;print lines&quot;
p Time.now.strftime(&quot;%F %T&quot;)

# recieve part
while true do
  line = sp.gets.split(&quot; &quot;)
  if(line[0].to_s == &quot;##&quot;)
    id = line[1]
    value = line[2]
    db.execute &quot;insert into readings values ( ?, ?, ?)&quot;, id,value, Time.now.strftime(&quot;%F %T&quot;)
    printf(&quot;%s : %s.%s @ %s\r\n&quot;, id, value[0..-2],value[-1,1],Time.now.strftime(&quot;%F %T&quot;))
  end
end


sp.close</code></pre></div><p>However I cannot seem to get the gems (serialport &amp; sqlite) working on openwrt. I have read on this forum that gems aren&#039;t really supported due to the difficulty porting them.<br />I have found a ipkg source which seems to have a ruby-serialport package: <a href="http://www.aprs4r.org/openwrt/backfire-10.03/brcm47xx/">http://www.aprs4r.org/openwrt/backfire-10.03/brcm47xx/</a><br />It installs but when running the program it complains that the file serialport.so is not for MIPS.<br />This is apparently a &quot;mipsel&quot; package and won&#039;t run on my device. I am a novice so I don&#039;t really know how to compile my own.</p><p>Does anybody know how to read (and hopefully write) to aserial port under Ruby?</p><p>I am open to changing to something else like Python or Perl, any sugestions?</p><p>p.s. I am a newbe on the OpenWrt platform.</p>									</div>
