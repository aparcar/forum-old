					<p>I have new Archer C7 unit 3.14.3 Build 150427 Rel 36706n that I would like to flash with openwrt.<br />I have read about the locking down of the TPLINK units and wonder if I should even attempt to do this.<br />I would like to have QOS for my voip connection and also could use the features of openwrt.<br />Should I try this? I have flashed other equipment before but have no experience flashing routers.</p>									</div>
