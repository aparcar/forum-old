					<p>Hey,</p><p>Being totally fresh in the forum, I hope I&#039;m not posting this in the wrong place. If so, please move it to a more appropriate place.</p><p>I bought a router with OpenWrt preinstalled a couple of months ago on recommendation from a friend. Here&#039;s the router I bought:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Customized-MT7620A-openwrt-wireless-router/32267126259.html">http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Customiz â€¦ 26259.html</a>. Soon I&#039;ll be leaving my home country to reside in a warmer and sunnier place during the winter. Because of this I would like to use my router as a VPN if possible. Not router to router, but by being able to access it from select programs/applications. If possible, I want to be able to use it with different IPs to let friends use it too.</p><p>The first question is if it&#039;s possible at all? I&#039;m quite computer litterate, but a total noob when it comes to OpenWrt and configuring it.</p><p>Thanks for your time.</p><p>Snah</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, that seems possible; but in my experience, setting up a VPN server in OpenWrt was not an easy task (at least,when compared to other tasks I performed on OpenWrt).</p>									</div>
