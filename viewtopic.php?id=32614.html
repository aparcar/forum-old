					<p>Hi, Everyone,<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; I&#039;ve read through the WNDR3700v2 info on the HW wiki at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3700">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3700</a> but I&#039;m still a bit confused on exactly <em>which</em> file to use for the initial flash.</p><p>&nbsp; Given the fact my new WNDR3700 is, in fact, v2 of the hardware, I understand that I need to use the most recent RC of &quot;Backfire,&quot; v10.03.1-rc5, for it to work.&nbsp; I also understand the devs recommend the squashfs images...&nbsp; that being the case, then, there are three possible files:</p><p>openwrt-ar71xx-wndr3700v2-squashfs-factory.img<br />openwrt-ar71xx-wndr3700v2-squashfs-factory-NA.img<br />openwrt-ar71xx-wndr3700v2-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin</p><p>&nbsp; If I&#039;m trying to flash the router which is currently running the Netgear image, which do I use?&nbsp; I am located in North America, so is that what the &quot;NA&quot; tag means on the second file?<br />&nbsp; Being new to OpenWrt, are the &quot;sysupgrade&quot; files used for upgrading a router already running an older version of OpenWrt?</p><p>&nbsp; I apologize in advance if this is listed in detail elsewhere; I searched the OpenWrt forums and Wiki about the WNDR3700v2 and didn&#039;t seem to be able to find a step-by-step guide with specific filenames...&nbsp; just wanted to be sure I had the right info before I got started...</p><br /><p>&nbsp; Thanks very much in advance for any assistance!</p>									</div>

					<p>It occurred to me the router is new and returnable so I might as well try it and see what happens...</p><p>I used the 10.03.1-rc5 file &quot;openwrt-ar71xx-wndr3700v2-squashfs-factory-NA.img&quot; and, thankfully, it flashed fine.&nbsp; Hope that was the right one!&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Initial impressions with OpenWrt compared to dd-wrt is that this looks <em>very</em> nice!&nbsp; I&#039;ll try messing around with the wireless radios this weekend.</p>									</div>

					<p>You got the correct file, (even the NA = North American version for avoiding Netgear firmware warnings during the initial flash).<br />If future, use the sysupgrade for upgrades from existing Openwrt systems. (And then again factory, if you need to use the failsafe mode to recover from a bad flash.)</p><p>Ps. There are also ready-compiled tailored versions available for 3700 (from the Community releases section of the forum) with all the buttons working etc. If you are interested, check Arokh&#039;s and my threads in that section.</p>									</div>
