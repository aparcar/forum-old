					<p>Without seeing more of the protocol trace it is hard to tell what is happening exactly.</p><p>There are two independent parts to this message:</p><p>1. &quot;TCP Retransmission&quot;<br />2. &quot;Continuation or non-HTP Traffic&quot;</p><p>TCP Retransmission means that TCP detected that a packet was lost somewhere in the network and it is retransmitting the lost packet.<br />Lost packets can be due to a number of reasons including errors on the line, congestion in the network or excessive delay (an ACK is delayed longer than the retransmission timeout).&nbsp; It isn&#039;t unusual on the Internet.&nbsp; I usually don&#039;t worry about them unless I get a lot.&nbsp; When looking at Wireshark traces you are likely to see other anomalies such as &quot;TCP Previous segment lost&quot;,&nbsp; &quot;TCP Dup Ack&quot;, &quot;Out of Order&quot;, etc.</p><p>The packets could be dropped anywhere on the path between your client and the server so it might not have anything to do with your wireless LAN or router.&nbsp; Of course, if both ends are on your local network, then it could indicate a local problem.&nbsp; But retransmissions happen occasionally so unless they are excessive I don&#039;t worry about this.&nbsp; If you are getting excessive retransmissions it will slow down your downloads and you will probably need to troubleshoot.</p><p>The wireshark website has some good tutorials on how to use wireshark to troubleshoot problems.<br /><a href="http://www.wireshark.org">http://www.wireshark.org</a>.</p><p>The second item isn&#039;t necessarily an error.&nbsp; It usually means that Wireshark got a packet on port 80 that it could not decode as HTTP.</p>									</div>
