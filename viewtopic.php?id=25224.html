					<p>Good afternoon to everyone.</p><p>First of all I would like to introduce myself to the forum. I am Alkis and I am software engineer based in Athens Greece.</p><p>For the purposes of a project we need a BT-AP+router so that &quot;dummy&quot; Bluetooth devices can send their data to our server. We searched for off-the-self BT-AP but prices where too high. A colleague in the lab, suggested to go for an OpenWRT router and then add a USB BT-dongle that with some programming/configuration would get BT-data and forward them to our server (specific IP/Port).</p><p>However, because I&#039;m new to this and I would like to avoid spending hours searching for something that some of the members might already know I humbly make the following questions:<br />1. Is there a preferred OpenWRT router for doing that? Colleagues here suggested the Linksys ADSL2MUE.<br />2. Is there a preferred USB BT dongle that I should buy, or any could do?<br />3. Is there any documentation/steps on what I have to do in order to achieve my task?<br />&nbsp; 3.a. Is there any off-the-self software/application already created by any of the forum members that forwards BT data to an IP address?</p><p>Thanks in advance and I hope I haven&#039;t violated any forum rule.</p><p>Kind Regards<br />Alkis</p>									</div>

					<p>I am also trying to get my device to use bluetooth.</p><p>I am having troubles getting it working but I thought I would respond to say there does not seem to be a lot BT response beyond cookbook stuff.&nbsp; In other words, I have not found much in the way of troubleshooting.</p><p>I am using a Dockstar to connect a bluetooth dongle.&nbsp; I infer from comments that some BT dongles require uploading firmware.&nbsp; Whether that is still the case with recent Openwrt versions I am not sure.&nbsp; This is an extra step or more.</p><p>There is other info on making a BT access point on the NSLU-2 forum.</p><p>I believe my problems are related to the latest version Backfire so I think using an earlier proven version of Openwrt should be pretty straight forward.&nbsp; Just install the modules.</p><p>Almost any router with a usb port should suffice.&nbsp; One of the common Asus devices has two ports already configured and I believe it works well on the 2.6 versions of the firmware so other features are built into the kernel. But 2.4 is pretty hardy so I am sure there are ways to get that going without much effort.</p><p>My goal is to use the dockstar in my car to pair my 3g phone connection to unit and use wireless dongle to provide connections to anyone in the car. Basically a portable hotspot.</p><p>The other dockstar application here describes using bluetooth to announce the presence of BT-equipped cellphone users when the come in proximity to the device for call routing.&nbsp; It is part of the home pbx device.</p><p>I am not very capable with the openwrt tools, I use the images others have built.&nbsp; I have not succeeded in comprehending everything necessary to do this myself although I am progressing toward that goal.&nbsp; So I am not the most authoritative source to answer your questions.&nbsp; But I hope this provides some guidance and perhaps prompts others to respond.</p><p>Paul</p>									</div>

					<p>I have another idea.&nbsp; Try the guru plug.&nbsp; The latest version has built in bluetooth as well as wireless and two gigabit ethernet sockets ready to go out of the box for about 135 dollars.&nbsp; If I was so cheap I would give away my dockstar and go that route. </p><p>Paul</p>									</div>
