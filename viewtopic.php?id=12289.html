					<p>The problem is as follows: I have created an ssh tunnel (using putty on a winXP machine) to a remote Linux server. My router to the internet is a WRT54G with whiterussian 0.9. The diagram is as follows:</p><p>Windows XP-Putty &lt;---&gt; openWRT (WR 0.9) &lt;---&gt; Remote Linux (openSSH 3.9p1)</p><p>The remote linux machine runs apache so I create a ssh tunnel on port 80 on the winXP to the remote machine (127.0.0.1:80). Now when I access the remote pages through localhost on the windows XP machine everything seems to be working ok except a number of complex pages which are always broken. It is like the connection is dropped at a specific point in the page (inside iframes). It has to be an openwrt problem as any other router (or DD-WRT on the same router) in place of the openwrt works ok. </p><p>The pages come from an asterisk trixbox installation. Some complex pages like the backup schedule page are incomplete when the ssh tunnel traverses the openwrt.</p><p>I guess that either there is an incompatibility with the kmod nat helpers or I need another contrack helper which is not in the standard distribution.</p><p>Anyone had the same experiences?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
