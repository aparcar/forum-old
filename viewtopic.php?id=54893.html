					<p>I&#039;m running OpenWrt Chaos Calmer r43814 (compiled from source) on a TP-Link Archer C7 v2 with the default configuration. When booting the router, it doesn&#039;t get it&#039;s ip address from the cable modem : the only way I can make it work is to physically unplug and replug the ethernet cable of the cable modem then it gets it&#039;s IPv4 address.</p><p>I tried different things but I always have the problem:</p><p>-shutting down the cable modem for several hours<br />-enabling DOCSIS 3<br />-masquarading the MAC address using my old router MAC</p><p>Any ideas?</p>									</div>

					<p>If it&#039;s any help -- I&#039;ve just returned my Archer C7v2 to newegg because of the defective WAN port. Have you considered yours could be defective too? Have you tried a different provider? Stock firmware?</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve got the same problem and I can&#039;t help you FIX it but I&#039;ve got a workaround.</p><p>1) It seems to be OpenWrt that is the problem, not the router.&nbsp; <br />With the stock tp-link firmware it doesn&#039;t do this.</p><p>2) I&#039;ve plugged the WAN port of the router and the LAN port of my cable modem into a small switch.&nbsp; Those are the only 2 devices connected to the switch.<br />For some reason it works in this configuration.&nbsp; That is to say, it will get a DHCP address w/o having to unplug/replug the WAN cable.</p>									</div>
