					<p>Hi Every one:<br />I&#039;m a newer to openwrt, but i have experience working on other platform of ucLinux/Linux system.</p><p>now, i get the source code from git repository and the first time i didn&#039;t change any other settings only set the target boart as: ralink28xx/ rt5350/HLK-RM04 profile.</p><p>then, after complier, i could get the correct image openwrt-ramips-rt305x-hlk-rm04-squanshfs.bin.</p><p>i think this image contains the rootfs and the kernel, the size was around 2.8MB. <br />after i changed some setting just like enable LUCI and so on, i also could get the correct image for programming the spi flash memory. the size increased to 3.4MB.</p><p>but later, i didn&#039;t know where i changed in the menuconfig, i never get the correct image anymore. but the compiler result shows finised without errors. i only get the kernel image (around 900KB) and the rootfs image (2.8MB). the purpose was get an image conbined these two packs. So that i could program the image to the flash memory use the programer made by me. <br />i ever meet similar issue on blackfin DSP uclinux builder, that time because i deselected the rootfs image type, but now, i checked all the settings and didn&#039;t found this error. i hope some one could tell me what&#039;s the root case. many thanks.</p><br /><p>by the way, i want to change the wifi mac in the source code. my platform was ramips based RT5350, 8MBYTE flash / 32 MB SDRAM (I changed it myself).</p><p>Waiting good new online.</p><p><img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
