I&#039;ll worry about restricting access once it&#039;s working.

Have spent several days pouring over docs and posts (many of which are years out of date) and have come up empty.

					<p>You should try enabling NAT on the br interface I think, and enable default route on br. If the main router recognizes 10.0.0.x, and has a static route to 10.0.0.x, then you shouldn&#039;t need NAT on br.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks. I really wish I had a better handle on routing. The default route for br is assigned by DHCP and points to the Internet router. From the Openwrt device, I can reach the Internet (via the br interface) and the computers connected to the guest interface. I&#039;m just not sure how to route packets correctly between the two.</p>									</div>

					<p>what does the routing table look like on the default gateway?&nbsp; if you are not masq then you need some routing protocol active to let the internet router know where the 10.0.0.0 network is otherwise its going to either drop the packets or send them to its default gateway.</p><p>It is also possible your ISP is using the 10 network internall fouling up the mix.</p><p>the statements you made about your routing table are accurate EXCEPT, and this is mostly semantics, the default gateway sends all unknown addresses to the default gateway.&nbsp; So if you tried to get to 192.168.33.33, it would go to the default gateway as well even though it isn&#039;t an &quot;internet&quot; packet.....</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you mikma and WWTK!</p><p>Your comments pointed me in the correct direction. I&#039;m not sure why it didn&#039;t work the first time I tried it, but the key was mikma&#039;s idea about enabling nat on the br interface (NOT the guest interface). Since the main router (the one providing addresses on the bridge) has no knowledge of any other subnets, this is necessary. But it&#039;s also important to restrict masquerading to the 10.0.0.x guest subnet - no need to confuse main router by masquerading addresses on its own subnet. So the correct (/etc/config/firewall) zone stanza for the bridge is:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config zone
        option name  br
        list   network  &#039;br&#039;
        option input  ACCEPT
        option output  ACCEPT
        option forward  ACCEPT
        option masq     1
        option mtu_fix 1
        option masq_src &#039;10.0.0.0/24&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Then the guest zone can be defined as:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config zone
        option name &#039;guest&#039;
        option network &#039;guest&#039;
        option input &#039;REJECT&#039;
        option forward &#039;REJECT&#039;
        option output &#039;ACCEPT&#039;</code></pre></div><p>...with appropriate firewall rules for what gets passed from guest to br.</p>									</div>
