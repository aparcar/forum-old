I would still recommend to try qos-scripts and sqm-scripts as both should make it more likely that your users stay happy (or at least calm <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> ). sqm-scripts advantages are link layer adjustments and IPv6 support as far as I know, both of which seem not required in your case so just test both and keep the one you are happier with. It would be great if you could post the results of your tests though, so other might learn fem your experiments.</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>

What kernel are you using, if I might ask?<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>I used iperf to test traffic in a single direction - remote site to router - to reduce variables and because the majority of traffic is incoming (web pages, streaming multimedia.)</p></blockquote></div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Okay, that is introducing another problem, your router already will struggle to actually run qos-scripts, so also running iperf on the router itself will reduce the effective shaper rate even more. Unless you actually envision your router to do other cpu demanding things like file serving, your are not testing the configuration you want to use.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>The throughput tracks consistently against the qos &quot;download&quot; property from the default (1024kbps) through 12000kbps where it seems to level off.&nbsp; I could not achieve a higher download throughput than 11.8Mb/sec with qos on.&nbsp; When I disable qos and rebooted, download throughput returned to ~50Mb/sec.</p></blockquote></div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the fun of it logg into your router while the test iOS running and run &quot;top -d 1&quot; and look at the percent idle column in the header as well as the sirq column; I would not be amazed if idle would hover around 0% and sirq maybe in the 50-90% range...<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>I suspect the culprits to be the netfilter qos_Default and qos_Default_ct chains, appended to the FORWARD chain when qos is running.&nbsp; So I looked at the iptable dumps.&nbsp; Packets bound for the router should be using INPUT chain so the qos chains should have nothing to do with the iperf server session on the router itself.&nbsp; I added a rule to accept the iperf port 5001 in zone_wan_input and this has NOTHING to do with the qos rules.</p><p>To summarize: on a tp-link tl-1043ndv2, enabling qos seems to drop throughput to a max of 12Mb/sec to the router.&nbsp; The QoS netfilter rules should not be tested for traffic bound for the router but they appear to be.</p></blockquote></div><p>I have no opinion on net filter configuration issue you raised, but I would propose to test the router while routing and run iperf on a machine behind the router in your internal network. I have never used a 1043ndv2 myself, but would be amazed if this would top out at 11.8Mbps. </p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>
