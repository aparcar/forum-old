					<p>Hi there, I have an Airlink AR525W router on which I just installed the Kamikaze 8.09 X-wrt build (openwrt-rdc-squashfs-ar525w-web.img) on it.&nbsp; I read in the common mistakes about an issue where the password isn&#039;t being saved on reboots.&nbsp; My router doesn&#039;t save any data on it during reboots, so I tried running</p><p>mtd linux unlock<br />jffs2root --clean</p><p>However, the jffs2root command is not included in my build.&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp; Anything that requires a router reboot isn&#039;t going to work, and I can&#039;t remember if ipkg reboots after installing a package.&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp; I&#039;d also be happy to simply reflash it with a newer build, but the web interface in X-War won&#039;t accept any of the images built for the AR525W.</p><p>So, any suggestions would be great.&nbsp; I&#039;ve searched around to no avail.</p><p>Thanks<br />Eamon</p>									</div>
