					<p>Yes, if you do the upgrade through LuCI or sysupgrade you can tell it to preserve previous config files.&nbsp; Alternatively, a backup/restore of the config thorugh LuCI should also be fine, or - depending on whether your image uses squashfs or not - a copy of /overlay using SCP is also a good failsafe backup mechanism.&nbsp; Last-ditch, almost all config you can make resides in /etc/config, so a backup copy of that would also help.</p><p>I&#039;ve not used chaos calmer yet; from recent forum postings it seems stable enough by now, but with trunk it is always a bit of a case of &quot;life is a box of chocolates...&quot; Testing with a known-good version is a good sanity-check.</p>									</div>
