					<p>Hello,</p><p>First of all, to all of the contributors, THANK YOU for making this available and possible. My son and I are working on this together and it has been both rewarding and educational.</p><p>Here is what we have:</p><p>mike@alex:~/openwrt/trunk/bin/ramips$ ls<br />md5sums&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;openwrt-ramips-rt305x-root.squashfs&nbsp; openwrt-ramips-rt305x-vmlinux.bin&nbsp; packages<br />openwrt-ramips-rt305x-esr-9753-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin&nbsp; openwrt-ramips-rt305x-uImage.bin&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;openwrt-ramips-rt305x-vmlinux.elf</p><p>So, What in the world do we send to the router??

					<p>Really! wow no advice as to which binary should be used. There is no documentation on this. This website has good information but is terribly disorganized. </p><p>Conclusion: We flashed the ESR-9753 UPGRADE. It all works fine sept no luci. She didn&#039;t compile in for some reason. We won&#039;t be needing her anyway!</p><p>Thanks for the build tools and website.</p><p>Regards</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mroussin51</strong> on 3 Mar 2012, 06:16)</p>

					<p>I just want to say thanks again. That was an encore router that we flashed. It is still working fine. This machine is connected to it and bandwidth is normal. I will hang on the wall tonight. I am excited about it. I think I am going to purchase obscure routers and upgrade their firmware. You know, routers that are not on the supported hardware list like this one. It was fun and quite easy. I wish my job were that easy. I work in a highly regulated industry where documentation really counts. We can be shut down or have product recalled over documentation. I definitely know good documentation when I see it. I am qualified to validate documentation. I like BSD better than linux because they get it. Get it?</p>									</div>
