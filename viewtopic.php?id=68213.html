					<p>No , the reg works fine. Maybe I should be more clear. The local regulation laws has made us to only have our country fixed on the reg domain , so we can only choose our country&#039;s free channels . and we want the firmware to not show any other countries or give us any options.<br />Thank you</p>									</div>

					<p>You can only fix it if you control the hardware, everything else is at best an attempt at obfuscation. So unless you are the manufacturer or get the manufacturer to build a special batch for you I don&#039;t see how you can comply with your local law.</p><p>How to trick the dd-wrt gui into displaying what you want brings us back to eduperez suggestion.</p>									</div>

					<p>You can certainly do this in Openwrt, but it would require making some custom modifications to the source code and building your own image</p>									</div>
