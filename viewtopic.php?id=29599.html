					<p>I am using a TP-LINK MR-3220 router to run some scanning software I am currently developing. I have had no problems building my software and getting it all up and running when connected to it via Ethernet, but now I want to set it out in a remote location and access it via WiFi. All I am looking to do is have the MR-3220 connect to an existing WPA WiFi network, grab a DHCP lease (or use static, either will work), and let me connect to it via SSH. It doesn&#039;t need a firewall, or run NAT, or really do anything else.</p><p>I have disabled dnsmasq and the firewall, and have setup the network and wireless configuration files as follows:</p><p><em>/etc/config/network</em><br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;interface&#039; &#039;loopback&#039;

As soon as I unplug the Ethernet cable, all communication to the wlan0 IP stops. I have been trying to debug this for some time, but don&#039;t seem to be getting anywhere. I was thinking there might be some kind of bridging or VLAN issue going on that is linking the wired and wireless interfaces, but I am not sure how that can be since I removed all of that from the networking configuration file. </p><p>I have looked online for awhile and have not been able to find any information on this problem, and would appreciate any guidance on what I can do to figure it out.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, I have gotten it working, but I am still not really sure as to what the problem itself is.</p><p>After some experimentation, I found that if I use the WAN port (eth1) rather than the switch (eth0), it works as expected. Also, if I bring up the eth0 interface manually after boot (ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.20 up), it also works as expected.</p><p>So the problem seems to be if I have both the wlan0 and eth0 interfaces configured at the same time in /etc/config/network. I don&#039;t know why this is, but the workaround of using the WAN port is good enough for me at this point.</p>									</div>

					<p>The problem is that you have the same subnet at the same time. This is not supposed to work and what you did as workaround is just voodoo to make it work somehow while the underlying issue is still present.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you read a few posts up, you will see I tried with eth0 on a completely different network, and had the same problem.</p><p>Even still, I don&#039;t understand how that would be considered normal behavior. It should be no different than having a laptop connected to the same network over Ethernet and WiFi at the same time. If I unplug my Ethernet cable, my WiFi doesn&#039;t simply stop working.</p><p>Also, I don&#039;t want to even use eth0, it is simply there as a fallback incase WiFi is not available. Under normal operation, eth0 won&#039;t even be connected to anything. So again, it is like saying you have to manually bring down an Ethernet interface to use WiFi on a laptop. It just doesn&#039;t work that way on normal hardware and full Linux OSes (or any other OS for that matter).</p><p>Plus the fact that the same configuration works when using eth1 would seem to show pretty clearly that there must be some internal conflict between the two interfaces which would normally be LAN facing.</p>									</div>
