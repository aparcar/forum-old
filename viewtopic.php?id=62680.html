					<p>Hello all.</p><p>Some time ago I got from a friend of the old Linksys WRT54GL. Because now i have some free time, I thought whether it is possible to connect the display 2x16 LCD with HD44780 via I2C. Do I need to hook up the GPIO is there another way to make this idea?</p><p>I was read about LCD4Linux, but i have some problem to connect LCD to main board.</p><p>Greetings!</p>									</div>
