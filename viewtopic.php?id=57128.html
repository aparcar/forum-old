					<p>I have very few modules installed on my router, mainly those needed for usb mounting, QoS and samba, everything else is unchanged. I&#039;ve noticed my router runs with about 83MB free out of 128MB. I tried moving some data to a samba share and it instantly drops to 2MB-5MB free. I run free or top and memory usage the smb daemons only consume about &lt;5% total. I am never able to reclaim this memory unless I reboot the router. I am running an ASUS RT-N56U with Chaos Calmer r45496. Anyone else experience this??</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rensorek</strong> on 3 May 2015, 00:24)</p>

					<p>Isn&#039;t it just the disk cache? In that case you should regain it by unmounting the disk. And you shouldn&#039;t worry about it, as Linux will free it up as soon as someone else needs it.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have the same problem. I am with Linksys WRT1200AC with ARM SoC. When i copy large files from PC to router with samba, the free memory going down from 440 MB to 3 MB, pyload and transmission are started. <br />Pyload and later transmission crash. Reboot in Lucy interface or as command in Putty not working, i must power off and on.<br />I have tried OpenWRT CC rc3 und trunk r46760, and different samba version samba server 3.6.25-4 and samba server 3.6.5-3<br />I have activated swap, but is not used, maybe another bug?</p><p>I will try this fix, modifying /etc/sysctl.conf</p><p>vm.min_free_kbytes=8096</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>slan</strong> on 2 Sep 2015, 12:45)</p>
