					<p>Hi, </p><p>I am trying to set my Gateworks Avila GW2348-2 router as a wireless access point. I downloaded backfire R3 version openWrt and flashed my router. </p><p>I disabled dnsmasq and firewall servises, enabled the radio card and set it as a AP. it works perfectly and I can connect my personal PC to router and surf Internet.&nbsp; </p><p>But, when I enable encryption for my wireless, (I enabled WPA-PSK2), the ESSID disappeared from wireless network scan. Or, sometimes, the networks appears, but block me from connection (there is no dialogue box poped up that asking me to enter the password). </p><p>Can I get some advice about where I did wrong? Did I miss some setting?</p>									</div>
