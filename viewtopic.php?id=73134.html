					<p>Hello friends,<br />I have this router which is working great and I wanted to switch to openwrt.<br />I have (my mistake) flashed the wrong firmware (15.05.01) instead of the supported one (15.05).</p><p>The problem that appeared was that the download speeds were undes 1Mbps... awful.<br />I saw the mistake, and reverted with tftp to last netgear firmware (which had ~140 Mbps) to see the same mega low download speed again, as in openwrt.</p><p>I have reset to defaults, wrote the firmware again (this time with LEDE) but the result was exactly the same.</p><p>What can I do, I don&#039;t think the router is malfunctioning due to hardware.<br />Is there a way to solve this?<br />Thanks.</p><p>Edit: router is v1 (Atheros). Also, it is disconnecting from time to time...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>overboost</strong> on 1 Feb 2018, 15:57)</p>

					<p>your netgear wndr4300 should behave exactly how it behaved when you flashed it back to the factory firmware.&nbsp; have you considered checking your ISP?&nbsp; e.g. cable mode, DSL modem.&nbsp; check your download speed directly with the modem to rule out any issue with your ISP.&nbsp; have you validated your modem is properly functioning?</p>									</div>

					<p>I have a backup&nbsp; router, which works flawlessly, on the same configuration.<br />Everything was check, no issie with ISP, cables, or other.</p><p>I presume there is some leftovers in the router&#039;s memory.<br />I tried 3 times back and forth to netgear genie, and openwrt firmware. The same bug is all over the place.</p><p>When I download the stock firmware, everything is rewritten?<br />It worked before, I have used it on stock firmware with &gt;100 Mbps. I am confident there is a minor bug somewhere, I do not know how to work it around.</p><p>Please, anyone can help?</p>									</div>

					<p>No, I&#039;m no expert.<br />I just managed to use the router with the stock netgear firmware, but it is very annoying as it keeps disconnecting frequently.<br />In this state (stock firmware) I presume it is impossible to explore firstboot.<br />I try to upgrade to Openwrt again, and get back here.<br />Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think I found the source of problem.<br />On my asus desktop openwrt netgear routers do not work.</p><p>I have tested both wndr3700 + wndr4300 on another desktop (dell) and they both work flawlessly.<br />However, when I plug them into my desktop, both have speeds of under 1Mbps.</p><p>Has anybody met this kind of issue?<br />I have been using Tp-links with dd-wrt without issue on my asus desktop.</p><p>PS: when i plug netgear with openwrt, for a few minutes everything is ok, then it hits me with low speed.<br />Please, any solutions?</p>									</div>
