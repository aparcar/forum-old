					<p>Well, you have to create swap in order to format since your router dont have enough memory to format large HD.<br />64 or 128 Mb should be enough. Otherwise just format the HD on another system and then replug.<br />Then just look if YOUR router needs extra ram or not.<br />If your average ram usage ( free )&nbsp; is usually below your router ram size you can safely delete the swap partition after you have formated your drive and convert it to storage space. I your router actually needs more ram well, just keep it.<br />But anyway, what&#039;s 128 or 64 Mb on current HD size ? Nothing much. So just keep it in case you later have use of it to format other hd or other tasks.</p>									</div>
