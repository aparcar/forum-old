					<p>I have setup my OpenWRT box (TP-Link WDR4300 with Chaos Palmer 15.05.01) in a OpenVPN network with external OpenVPN server. That works so far. The VPN network is 10.8.0.0/24, the physical interfaces of the box are 192.168.1.0/24 (LAN) and 192.168.178.0/24 (WAN). Now I want to connect an IP webcam via ethernet and access it via the VPN. What are the best options? DHCP would give the camera a 192.1.68.1.x address. Is forwarding the address to the VPN ok, or should I give a 10.8.0.1 address to one of the pyhiscal ports? How would I do this?</p>									</div>
