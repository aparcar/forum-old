					<p>Thanks to Mactalla and ValXdater, I can once again see the wireless radios and the proper id is showing for them.</p><p>I&#039;m going to let Mactalla put together the instructions (unless you would like me to Mactalla?) so that you get the exact details correct.&nbsp; I&#039;ve uploaded the modified firmware image that Mactalla created to make it easy for everyone to get.&nbsp; I gave him a link to it, so he&#039;ll include that in the directions.</p><p>I really want to thank Mactalla and ValXdater for their help.&nbsp; You are both a huge asset to this forum and this project, from all of us, THANK YOU!</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, ValXdater!</p><p>No point posting my instructions as it does the same job.&nbsp; Just to expand a little on the above instructions:</p><p>* These instructions are for you if the commands<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>hexdump /dev/mtd5ro -x | grep ^0001000
hexdump /dev/mtd5ro -x | grep ^0005000</code></pre></div><p>either do not produce any output, or the output they produce does not contain &#039;a55a&#039; as the second number.<br />Example of good output:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>0001000    a55a    0000    0003    6000    168c    0029    6008    0001</code></pre></div><p>* Your MAC for step 5 is printed on your box.&nbsp; Use this address to calculate the MAC for step 4.</p><p>* After doing this fix and rebooting / confirming the radios are working, I recommend flashing with a standard firmware to ensure this storage area remains readonly.</p>									</div>

					<p>THANK YOU GUYS so much for doing this!</p><p>Now I am not afraid to try OpenWRT and dd-wrt again!</p><br /><p>Now a question, if you don&#039;t mind...&nbsp; In these instructions, you created a file &quot;caldata&quot; and then wrote that to the caldata area of the flash, right?&nbsp; Well, if I have a working dir-825 where the caldata is already good, what command would I need to execute in order to create a backup of my existing calibration data, in case dd-wrt breaks it?&nbsp; </p><p>Just wondering how I could create a backup of my existing caldata if it is not yet broken, in case I need it later (in case I try dd-wrt again).</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello</p><p>Thanks for this solution.</p><p>I was able to rescue my DIR after using DD-WRT with &#039;clear jffs&#039; or something (maybe that was the cause ?). I used files from ValXdater and now from EU I have NA router (at least dmesg is saying that <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />) </p><p>anyone has cdata for EU ? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>BTW: There is one strange thing about MAC handling in openwrt. MAC on my DIR box is ending with _:58 and dd-wrt (original dlink firmware as well) is assigning that mac to WAN port. What is strange with openwrt is that _:59 is assigned to LAN, _:5a is assigned to WAN (I noticed it just because my ISP is filtering MAC adresses).</p>									</div>
