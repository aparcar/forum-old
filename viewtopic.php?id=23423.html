					<p>Hi All,</p><p>I understand that there has been at least one discussion on this here, but that hasn&#039;t really come to any conclusions (in fact, the original proposal was wrong, I believe, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=19979&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), so I would like to raise this subject again. In short, I would like to add a USB port to my Linksys WRT54G router, and I was wondering whether one could do this without hacking the hardware. There are USB-ethernet adapters, which connect to the RJ45, and have a USB A male on the other end, and they are supposed to connect a USB modem to the router. The point is that it basically and physically converts the RJ45 port into a USB socket, into which all the standard USB sticks, mouse, keyboard, webcam, whatnot can be plugged. So, the question really is, if I could use this to add perhaps up to 4 USB ports to a router. I think, the difficulty is that the router&#039;s got to play the host. I am really new to this subject, and I don&#039;t quite know where exactly I should start. Has anyone written a USB host application for a router? If so, can it be &quot;hijacked&quot;, and piped through the ethernet port?<br />Thanks,<br />v923z</p>									</div>
