					<p>Hi :-),</p><p>Thanks to all of you analysing hardware and adding support for OpenWRT!</p><p>If you ever wondered why it might be difficult to get OpenWRT on modems here is a nice document explaining our dear secret services interest:<br /><a href="http://cryptome.org/2013/12/Full-Disclosure.pdf">http://cryptome.org/2013/12/Full-Disclosure.pdf</a></p><p>Short-Summary:<br />Every DSL- or cable modem can be repurposed as a private-eye for the secret service (atleast in Great Britian the British Telecom does it). According to the cryptome document below the same approach is effectively available in UK, Sweden, Germany and similar free, democratic states. The technical ability has been present for years (provider updating a modem or router via a remote connection). But effectively using those possiblities in the field have mostly been deemed wild conspiracy theories. Provider modems are property of your provider, they run remotely updatable software and usuallly their source code is propertary and not public. The providers defend their approach with security reasons and protecting their internal network infrastructure. On first sight this might make sense - you don&#039;t want your neighbours playing around with your local block&#039;s power distribution board, water or power meters. SCARY is if your local home network traffic can be inspeced, your supposedly &quot;local private&quot; shares can be accessed by re-flashing your modem device ... well read for yourself:</p><p>German UnityMedia might or can use<br />.. in AVM modems: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TR-069">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TR-069</a><br />.. in my cisco modem: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calea">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calea</a></p><p>I searched the forums and did not see anyone mentioning it. I hope you&#039;re all well :-).&nbsp; Working on cable or broadband modems seems to a rebellious hobby :-). Likely Router hardware is close, but barely acceptable. I&#039;d really like to hear your perspective on things why cable modems do not run OpenWRT. Legally I think the most obvious reason is that you get sued if you re-distribute the propertary modem driver software.</p><p>Has anyone ever reverse engineered the hardware modem drivers for backdoors?<br />Is anyone aware of OpenWRT, open-source compatible DSL or DOCSIS modems?</p><p>Happy hacking! I&#039;m glad to have OpenWRT.</p>									</div>

					<p><strong>davie</strong>, I strongly think that installing OpenWrt gives you enough protection against unexpected functionality on your router/modem. At least - if you are not someone specifically targeted by special services.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>booBot</strong> on 12 Aug 2016, 19:12)</p>
