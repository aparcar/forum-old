					<p>I finally got around to documenting my WRT54G/OpenWrt OpenVPN server and a notebook Win2K OpenVPN client in one spot.&nbsp; Lacking is key generation.&nbsp; I think I used about every security option there is, though.</p><p>I don&#039;t have a full understanding of cert and key files - but client keys were all generated the same time as the server and each end should have the minimum files required.&nbsp; I generated more keys than I&#039;ll ever use long ago using Win2K commandline easy-rsa in version 2.0.5.&nbsp; I understand new key file formats may be used now and the GUI is much easier to use.</p><p>This particular configuration has been used for over a year with much success and remained virtually identical on RC4/5/6/0.9.&nbsp; I recall user and group &#039;nobody&#039; and &#039;nogroup&#039; may have been an issue on RC4(?)&nbsp; OpenVPN itself started at 2.0.5 which is what I still run on the Win2K notebook.</p><p>From hotspots and hotels anywhere in the world my Win2K notebook can connect and behave as if it were plugged into my LAN including internet access out my LAN gateway.&nbsp; It uses my LAN DNS server, too.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t have a LAN DNS server I think you should be able to push your ISPs DNS the same way.&nbsp; I wanted nothing, including DNS, to be public and I watched it several times to be sure *everything* was through the tunnel and added a note about TAP networking order in Win2K to accomplish this.</p><p>This is a BRIDGED configuration.&nbsp; If you just want to connect to the OpenVPN server and not become an IP on an existing LAN then this configuration is not for you.</p><p>Linux clients and Windows servers should be very similar.</p><p>I like to convey important things rather than &quot;do this&quot; HowTo format.&nbsp; For example, you can use chmod or WinSCP to set x permissions for the startup file /etc/init.d/S70openvpnserver.</p><p>I&#039;ve munged most filenames to generic ones and carefully altered addresses (these are not my real LAN addresses).&nbsp; I hope there are no errors.&nbsp; My goal is to get this down for any discussions.</p><p>First, the WRT54G Server...<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>*** OpenVPN Server on OpenWrt 0.9

As a simple AP on my LAN (no WAN configured):
  Forward UDP port (MyOpenVPNPort) to the WRT54G&#039;s LAN address at the main router.
If this WRT54G is the main router:
  The WAN firewall must be set to &#039;accept&#039; UDP (MyOpenVPNPort)</code></pre></div><p>Now for the Win2K client...<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>*** OpenVPN Client on Win2K - version is 2.0.5 with GUI

It is important when connecting via public hotspot to place TAP interface as top priority.
This forces remote DNS from the LAN to be used and not the local DNS.
This is in Win2K Networking Properties: Advanced -&gt; Advanced Settings under &quot;Connections&quot;.
The client CANNOT connect successfully when already on the LAN.</code></pre></div><p>All Comments Welcomed.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Bill_MI</strong> on 26 Feb 2007, 00:39)</p>
