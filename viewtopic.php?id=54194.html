					<p>Hello, congratulations for the your work. I have found too many interesting things here, and im glad about this community tools.</p><p>Two years ago, i used your firmware to resurrent a huawei, stablishing two vlans, setting 1 lan port as wan.</p><p>Now with Tp-wr841n ver 8.4. I&#039;m trying to change his awfull native firmware.</p><p>Instead using a serial connection, i have use the web method, uploading the bin file.</p><p>Well, i had no problem at all, while my Tp-wr841n&nbsp; was connected (wan-to-lan) to my other router, getting via dhcp protocol, his new wan ip direccion.</p><p>The problem is, when i connect my wan port directly to my DCE, in dhcp mode, it didnt get a public ip, instead, it get a private one.<br />If i connect my other router or my pc to my DCE. They get a public one.</p><p>So ... i try to stablish a static ip, with the same values as my other router (gateway, dns, etc). But that didnt work. Probably because my isp bind MAC-PUBLIC_IP.</p><p>Do you know, how can i make my wan works?</p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Alikornio</strong> on 24 Nov 2014, 16:03)</p>
