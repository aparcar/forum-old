					<p>I&#039;m not very good on these things, but I had the same problem. I googled and googled again.<br />I have managed to get pptp vpn working by adding the following lines to the /etc/firewall.user file.</p><p>iptables -t nat -A postrouting_rule -p 50 -j ACCEPT<br />iptables -t nat -A postrouting_rule -p 51 -j ACCEPT<br />iptables -A forwarding_rule -i $WAN -o $LAN -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT</p><p>iptables -A forwarding_rule -o $WAN -j ACCEPT<br />iptables -A forwarding_rule -i $LAN -j ACCEPT<br />iptables -t nat -A postrouting_rule -o $WAN -j MASQUERADE</p><br /><p>I am not sure if they are in the right order but it works for rc5 pptp tested with two different servers. The first two relate to ipsec and are probably not required, but have not tested it. I think the third line is the key on as I think it says allow anything back if it originates from LAN.<br />Not sure how secure it is as it is behind another NAT router.<br />The information came from this page <a href="http://www.e-infomax.com/ipmasq/">http://www.e-infomax.com/ipmasq/</a> as most of the other pages are too far out of date for current iptable syntax.<br />Good luck<br />If someone could point us to a realtively simple guide to iptables I would be most grateful!<br />Regards<br />Chapelhill</p>									</div>

					<p>I havent changed anything on the RC5 config. It worked out of the box (so as to speak). I also have it working with RC4.</p><p>If you ssh into your router and run the following command<br />&gt;iptables -L <br />you will see that one of the input rules is to forward all your GRE traffic.</p>									</div>

					<p>Don&#039;t know if this is gonna help. I had simmlar issue with my vpn which turned out to be a vlan problem. </p><p>I connect my laptop through wireless and vpn connection can be established without a problem. But I can&#039;t access anywhere. From the vpn client&#039;s statistic I found there is no single incoming packet. I tcpdumped on the router and found that all the ESP packets from my lappy to vpn server were dropped by the router. ISAKMP packets are OK. The difference between these two types I see is that ESP packets all have a VLAN tag with ID 0. I&#039;m not familliar with VLAN at all and don&#039;t know if this ID means src or dst. So I moved my laptop to a wired connection and, dah, it works.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dreamdreams</strong> on 13 Sep 2006, 05:32)</p>
