					<p>Hi all. Now that 8.09 is released, can anyone recommend a router that works well with openwrt and that has (preferably built-in) adsl, wireless and a usb port (or 2). I&#039;m currently using a Netgear DG834G v2 which provides me with everything except for the USB, and a couple of Asus wl-500g routers (which don&#039;t have adsl).</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions for a single box that combines all these features?</p><p>Thanks in advance for any advice that people may have.</p><p>Jaime :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>I agree with Yanira.&nbsp; Is a tale of tears on the integrated chipsets.&nbsp; The vendors are not Linux friendly and/or chipsets update less and older designs that stick around too long.</p>									</div>
