					<p>Hi,<br />I just resently moved from dd-wrt and would never go back :-)</p><p>Just a small question:<br />I used my openvpn-config from my ddwrt and it worked without any problems. I had to change the format from a &quot;normal&quot; config file to the format in /etc/config/openvpn, but that&#039;s not the topic here.</p><p>Then I changed a little thing in openvpn-luci-webinterface and saved. I didn&#039;t see that this deleted also &quot;option &#039;script_security&#039; &#039;2&#039;&quot;, I need this because I have a simple route-up and down-script configuring some firewall rules.<br />I&#039;ve tried this out whenever I save my openvpn-config in luci-webinterface &quot;option &#039;script_security&#039; &#039;2&#039;&quot; gets deleted, everyhing else is working ok.</p><p>It&#039;s just a little thing, I have to think whenever I change something in the webinterface, but it&#039;s annoying ...<br />Am I missing something, is there a trick, or is this a bug?</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes it is a bug. Note that the openvpn gui isn&#039;t terribly useful anyway, all it really gives you is some restart knobs which you can also do through the init script menu.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, that was quite fast. Sorry forgot to mention that my version is 10.03.1 (if someone has this issue too). I know, all in all I&#039;m used to commandline from more than one linux-machine, but I found the configuration in luci quite impressive compared to the ddwrt-webinterface I used before.</p>									</div>
