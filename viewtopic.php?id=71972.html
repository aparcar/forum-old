					<p>Hi, I have a UniFi AP (Atheros AR9561) that I flashed to OpenWRT (Bleeding Edge, 50108).&nbsp; It works fine with my PC (a RTL8188RU wlan adapter) for the first few minutes, but then somehow it stops forwarding UDP/TCP/ICMP traffic.&nbsp; I still see the LEDs on the access point blinking though, so I&#039;m pretty sure the traffic is arriving on the access point.&nbsp; The non-IP traffic (EAPOL) still gets responded (&quot;Group rekeying completed&quot; from time to time in the wpa_supplicant log).</p><p>- To eliminate possible routing table issues, I&#039;ve tried to ping the access point on its link-local address, but it doesn&#039;t respond either.&nbsp; Clearing the ip6tables doesn&#039;t seem to help.<br />- With wireshark I notice a lot of neighbour solicitations.&nbsp; To eliminate possible NDP issues, I&#039;ve put permanent neighbour entries in both the access point and the PC.&nbsp; This makes the NDP traffic go away, but still no response to the outgoing ping requests.</p><p>When I try the other way around (ping from the access point to the PC on its link-local address), I see with wireshark that the PC is receiving the ICMP requests and responding to it, but somehow the &quot;ping6&quot; command on the access point still shows &quot;timeout&quot;.&nbsp; So I suspect that the traffic is somehow blacklisted or dropped on the access point, but I have no clue as to why/how (dmesg is empty).<br />This state doesn&#039;t recover;&nbsp; the only way to get the link going again (for a few minutes) is to restart wpa_supplicant and force a new connection.</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions on how I could debug this issue?&nbsp; Any suggestions (even the silly ones) are welcome!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>billcarson</strong> on 4 Sep 2017, 21:19)</p>
