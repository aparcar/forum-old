					<p>Hello,</p><p>I took a Nexx WT1520, installed the openwrt-15.05.1-ramips-rt305x-wt1520-8M-squashfs-factory.bin image and attempted to create a WiFi bridge using the NaCl interface. Everything went fine until in a moment of foolishness I reconfigured the LAN bridge to cover wwan instead of eth0.1. As a result, I am locked out of the device and cannot get back in to reconfigure. The device is however functional and correctly connects to wwan and broadcasts its own wireless network.</p><p>Using the &#039;normal&#039; mode, I have tried this:</p><p>1) Connecting to the &#039;old&#039; LAN address (192.168.1.5) using the LAN (and also WAN) port, to no avail.<br />2) Connecting to the &#039;client&#039; WWAN address given to the device (192.168.1.141) by the main router, to no avail.<br />3) Connecting to the wireless network broadcast by the device, attempting connection to the former addresses, also to no avail.<br />4) Pressing the reset button, to no avail. This is to say, the device neither restarts for a short push nor does it &#039;factory reset&#039; for a long push, as it should as per the <a href="https://github.com/hackruu/nexx-wt1520-openwrt/blob/master/FILES_1520/etc/rc.button/reset">default rc.button action</a>.</p><p>* NOTE: I am able to &#039;ping&#039; the device WAN (Ethernet) and WWAN (802.11n) addresses from those subnetworks. However, because of the default OpenWRT security mechanisms, this doesn&#039;t appear to be very useful as all ports are closed from the &#039;outside&#039;.</p><p>I have also attempted to enter failsafe mode. For those of you not familiar with this Nexx model, there seems to be only one accessible button, the &#039;reset&#039;. However, no amount of pressing &#039;reset&#039; seems to do any good during start up. For starters, the single visible LED does not appear to show any boot cycle feedback. What is more, I have tried listening for the special UDP message broadcast during boot using tcpdump as per the wiki instructions and I was unable to locate it. Pushing the reset button repeatedly since powering up for about 30s shows no indication of failsafe working, and 192.168.1.1 remains &#039;offline&#039;.</p><p>I would greatly appreciate any help on this matter to make my device accessible again. I would prefer software solutions that do not involve opening up the device to get serial or JTAG access, but I would consider those options as a last resort. Right now, it seems like I should be able to get into failsafe mode, if only I did everything right.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>EDIT: I forgot to mention I have another identical and functioning Nexx WT1520 with the same OpenWRT image. The second unit may help in some way to figure out a solution.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>corrideat</strong> on 16 Jun 2016, 02:23)</p>
