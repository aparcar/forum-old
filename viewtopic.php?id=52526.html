					<p>I noticed you deleted this post:</p><p>Hi,<br />I&#039;m trying to customize OpenWRT for my platform to change language and theme, so I added a custom ect/config/luci with language and theme settings. After compiling the settings I get in the /etc/config/luci at rootfs folder are the LuCI default settings. OpenWRT completely override the settings I try to set.<br />Please could anybody tell how to change this OpenWRT behaviour?</p><p>What i have done so far is add to the openwrt scripts and then add these scripts to the buid as you have done (thanks to Dairyman). I have added jquery mobile .css .js files along with the usual www/luci-static/openwrt.org/cascade.css file.<br />One thing i found is when you make these changes and you need to see if it has made a difference is you need to go into TOOLS&gt;CLEAR BROWSER settings in Chrome (if you are using crome) before you see the changes.</p><p>I would love to get this theme to be completely standalone but it would mean somehow telling openwert/luci not to use the cascade.css files contents throughout its formatting. IT is a pain to add to it and if you have the time it would be worth a complete re-write but i am doing this after work finishes each day and i have a baby and wife to tend to also = not much time.</p><p>Checkout this post of mine it may help:</p><p><a href="http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-replies.cfm?t=2294185&amp;p=37#r737">http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-re â€¦ ;p=37#r737</a></p>									</div>
