					<p>Hi,</p><p>I reliaze there&#039;s kernel dependency problem while installing packages from the CC release repository, while the kernel version is mismatching. For example, the CC 15.05.1 was released with Linux Kernel 3.18.23</p><p>But the one I installed has kernel version 3.18.29(this one has proper support for my router)<br />So what&#039;s the proper way to solve this problem?</p><p>Shall I download the pacakge to local then force install them? Some will work, some will not install.</p><p>Many thanks,</p>									</div>

					<p>Openwrt has strict kernel module checksum checks. It is not only about the kernel version itself, but also about the options used when compiling the kernel (and kmods).</p><p>In practice you need to install kernel modules (kmod-*) from the same build run that built the main firmware.</p><p>Either<br />- use an official release so that you can install kernel modules from the official repo<br />- use a third-party firmware and use kernel modules from him.<br />- compile everything by yourself.</p><p>you may try --force-depends option in opkg, but that is pure lottery especially if there is already 3.18.23-.29 difference.</p>									</div>
