					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m pretty new to openwrt, but i absolutely love the concept of it. I currently own 3 routers;<br />1 Topcom Skyracer WBR 7011b (where this topic is about, rev a?)<br />1 D-link DIR-655 (unfortunally will be never supported, unknown rev.)<br />1 D-link DI-604 (rev D1, F/W 3.01), found while dump diving, unsure if its still working due missing 5V-2A power adapter (also not supported by openwrt)</p><p>On the side note i also owned a DIR-615, wich i sold for 15€ to my girlfriend. And a TP-LINK TL-WR703N is in order, what i plan to hack with a usb ports and network monitor on a DPF.<br />Anyways, about the Topcom:</p><p>I popped it open to see what&#039;s under the hood:<br />RTL8181<br />RTL8305SB<br />MXs042305</p><p>And a free ram space!&nbsp; (ram mod? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /> ) I also see a 8 pin programmer plug, wich run to the RTL8181 (not jtag, right?)</p><p>Since this is a not so popular router, can anyone give me a some hand on finding out if its posible to run openWRT on it, and maybe help me compile?</p><p>Thanks!</p><br /><p><strong>Edit:</strong> Just found this: <a href="http://openlinksys.info/forum/viewthread.php?forum_id=21&amp;thread_id=146">http://openlinksys.info/forum/viewthrea … ead_id=146</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dabeast</strong> on 22 Jan 2012, 21:20)</p>
