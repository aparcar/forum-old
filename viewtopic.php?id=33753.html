					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have a device that requires connection to other device that is only within same IP block with mask 255.255.255.0 (need only to differ with last number block).</p><p>So is it possible to VPN two home networks and make all computers with IP like 192.168.5.xxx ?? in both networks?</p><p>Also, I would like to let 2 routers handle Tunnelling, so no PC needs to be turned on, I assume it&#039;s possible.</p><p>+ One of networks is public Dynamic IP.<br />+ Seccond network does not have public IP. Its local network that divides Internet to all flats.</p><p>As an alternative I think of using hamachi like software (and connectiong bridging), but would like to avoid it since it requires PC to be turned on.</p><p>Thank you all for help.</p>									</div>
