					<p>Hi !</p><p>I have created 2 x SSIDs (1 for staff and another for guests) on the same WiFi interface.<br />Now its need to block some IPs and IP ranges on guest network, for example SMB, AFP, SSH, etc.<br />However, in firewall rules I can specify only network name (e.g. LAN).</p><p>How to define firewall rules to block ports on guest WiFi only?<br />Or I should create new network (e.g. guest_lan) and assign that WiFi SSID to it ?</p><p>Thanks in advance for any suggestion(s).</p>									</div>

					<p>If both SSID are on the same &quot;LAN&quot; network, then there is no separation between them, and you cannot do that type of filtering. Have a look at these guides to see how to accomplish that:</p><p><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan</a><br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan-webinterface">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/gu â€¦ binterface</a></p>									</div>
