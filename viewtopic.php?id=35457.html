					<p>Hello,</p><p>For a while I&#039;ve been building my own openwrt for my Netgear WNDR3700, and they work fine for the biggest part. However, I do have some wireless devices (to be specific: a Logitech Squeezebox Boom) that disconnects regularly after a few days of uptime. I regularly compile new builds, especially when I find new ath9k or mac80211 checkins in the dev-logs (<a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/log/trunk">https://dev.openwrt.org/log/trunk</a>), to see if things are changed for the better. The connection was rock-solid with the stock firmware, so I&#039;ve been digging around some more to find anything which is related. </p><p>I came up with this change: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/23163">https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/23163</a>, which changed the rate_control from &quot;ath9k specific&quot; to &quot;minstrel&quot; by default. Just for testing, I want to undo only that change (and keep any newer patches) and now the question is: how do I do that? I tried simply deleting the trunk/package/mac80211/patches/017-remove_ath9k_rc.patch file, then do a make dirclean, but then the build process fails. I think I have to undo the changes to the makefile as well, but that seems a lot of hacking which in turn might break other patches. Is there a better way to do this?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>It is highly unlikely that the RC algorithm is to blame here. Usually the compatibility issues revolve around broken aggregation setup or wpa interop problems, sometimes bad timing as well.</p>									</div>
