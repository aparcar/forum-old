					<p>(cause some wrt devs doesnt read/answer mails..)</p><p>i seen recently a common thing about a lot of devices who could run owrt :<br />there is no clearly explaination about how to install it.</p><p>i mean everybody here is supposed to be a geek, but what if somebody have a supported router (exact model), without being a geek, just wanna test openwrt, maybe for experimentations or just gathering knowledge and skills, even for use it everyday;</p><p>the matter is, about the wiki:</p><p>there is NO any page seems like another;</p><p>all pages about devices are just a mass of records and note (which is good) without any organization (not so..);</p><p>my suggestion, would be :</p><p>why dont put three or four clearly parts in each device file?</p><p>Like :</p><p>1- Information<br />data of the device, board, hardware, compatibility..<br />2. how to install it (few ways, but for example explaining with several methods of flashing..)<br />3. how to access it..</p><br /><br /><p>for example, i expercienced these issues when converting some devices recently :<br />DG834GT : broadcom based, was able to flash it with backfire, but stopping during boot;<br />works perfectly on attitude adjustment.<br />These two last information are not mentionned anywhere in this netgear model page.</p><p>neufbox6: no way to find how to flash it. eg, the flashimage.py is a deadlink from old device.</p><p>another one, which i could get these days :<br />a chinese router, some information of it running owrt, but nothing about install it on device.</p><p>sometimes...</p><br /><br /><p>other thing, i wondered about..</p><p>why, instead of having it in a wiki, having a big database of owrt devices?<br />i mean, just have a search engine, type WRT and all wrt-something models appear...<br />or with a manufacturer selection before.... could be great to avoid spending hours in the wiki..</p><p>just suggestion:)</p>									</div>

					<p>(another issue, when testing several versions of owrt :<br />why there is not the version name in the generated files? or ver number?<br />usually when you want to test CCalmer, but you have to test a legacy or older one, all files have the same names... things like this must be updated <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />(yes, i&#039;m trying to do end-user quality)</p>									</div>

Just type wrt into say the empty textfield below the &quot;Model&quot; column header and get a restricted view of all hardware entries that have wrt as part of their model name. And if you start from <a href="https://openwrt.org">https://openwrt.org</a> this searchable database is linked from the sole link &quot;Supported Devices&quot; (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start</a>) in the first section (&quot;Waht is OpenWrt&quot;).<br />Maybe doing a bit more research before posting might be a good idea?</p>									</div>
