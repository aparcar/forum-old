					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have 2 linksys routers, a WRT54G and a WRT54GS.&nbsp; I built and flashed the openwrt binary for the WRT54G router and everything worked fine.&nbsp; Now, I&#039;m trying to flash the other router (GS), and tftp keeps telling me that I have an invalid password:</p><p>[sam@localhost build_30062004]$ ls<br/>openwrt-g-code.bin&nbsp; openwrt-gs-code.bin<br/>[sam@localhost build_30062004]$ tftp 192.168.1.2<br/>tftp&gt; binary<br/>tftp&gt; trace<br/>Packet tracing on.<br/>tftp&gt; rexmt<br/>(value) 1<br/>tftp&gt; put openwrt-gs-code.bin<br/>sent WRQ &lt;file=openwrt-gs-code.bin, mode=octet&gt;<br/>sent WRQ &lt;file=openwrt-gs-code.bin, mode=octet&gt;<br/>sent WRQ &lt;file=openwrt-gs-code.bin, mode=octet&gt;<br/>sent WRQ &lt;file=openwrt-gs-code.bin, mode=octet&gt;<br/>sent WRQ &lt;file=openwrt-gs-code.bin, mode=octet&gt;<br/>sent WRQ &lt;file=openwrt-gs-code.bin, mode=octet&gt;<br/>sent WRQ &lt;file=openwrt-gs-code.bin, mode=octet&gt;<br/>sent WRQ &lt;file=openwrt-gs-code.bin, mode=octet&gt;<br/>sent WRQ &lt;file=openwrt-gs-code.bin, mode=octet&gt;<br/>sent WRQ &lt;file=openwrt-gs-code.bin, mode=octet&gt;<br/>received ERROR &lt;code=100, msg=Invalid Password !!&gt;<br/>Error code 100: Invalid Password !!<br/>tftp&gt;</p><p>Now everything has been done according to what&#039;s written on the FAQ (boot_wait is on, I plug the router in after the put command has been sent) and I did exactly the same with my WRT54G (successfully).&nbsp; I even went back to firmare v2.06.1 to make sure linksys had not put some kind of password protection.</p><p>Note that I changed the IP of that router for 192.168.1.2.</p><p>Anybody has another way of flashing openwrt on the GS router?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Sam</p>									</div>

					<p>you know, I have flashed 5 wrtgs&#039;s now, and I swear each one of them seemed like I had to different stuff to get them flashed....it seems some sort of combination of unplugging it, and holding on the reset button for 10-15 seconds and, plug the power in(while still holding down on the reset) and hit enter on the tftp xfer. I&#039;v also held the reset button for 20 seconds after its powered up and gotten it to take an image -lol</p><p>I think it helped me to have a ping -t open on a seperate dos window. you will see it returning a couple of pings and then time out before resuming after its booted up....those couple of pings are the magic window I think</p><p>try the reset thing, after making sure boot_wait=on of course</p><p>keep screwing with it, it took me 3 hours to get one of my wrt54gs&#039;s flashed, and the next one i did took 5 minutes -lol</p>									</div>

					<p>First of all, thanks for your hints.&nbsp; </p><p>I finally decided to give a try to the update firmware facility from the original linksys administration web page on my router.&nbsp; I could&#039;n find any information whether or not this would work, and I figured the only way to find out was to try it.&nbsp; </p><p>I was then surprised to see it worked like a charm on my wrt54gs.&nbsp; Good thing, I would probably have bricked it had it failed.&nbsp; I still have no clue though as to know if I would be able to go back to linksys original firmware by sending it with tftp.&nbsp; I might try it soon.</p><p>Thanks, and keep posting if you have any other info useful for wrt54gs users out here...</p><p>Sam</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not sure if this is because I have a wrt v2.2 but I&#039;m getting the same thing when I try to flash it via tftp. I also tried to flash it using the linksys default front end. I&#039;ve tried 3 different tftp clients.</p><p>Any clues?</p>									</div>

					<p>Have you tried the tftp method I described in the forum topic:<br/>WRT54G 2.2, boot_wait = ON<br/><a href="http://www.openwrt.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=848">http://www.openwrt.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=848</a></p><p>This is a guess, but I believe that some tftp clients will try to use a password, while others don&#039;t, and apparently a password isn&#039;t necessary, but if the tftp client thinks it needs to specify one, you could have this problem.</p>									</div>
