					<p>I&#039;d like to thank those in this thread for the valuable information that allowed me to recover my bricked<br />wrt54gr.</p><p>I had installed OpenWRT on it and it worked for a few weeks but then stopped talking to the outside world after updating some network settings from the web interface. No HTTP access. No ping access. No TFTP access. The reset button did nothing. </p><p>I could telnet to it only by connecting it to another router and using that DHCP supplied address (in this case 192.168.1.3). It was frustrating knowing it was alive, but unusable. I found a recovery program in /etc, but it reported that it wasn&#039;t supported on this platform. There was no nvram support since this version of OpenWRT was running linux 2.6.24.7. Further investigation determined that mtdBlock1 was broken and mtdblock0 was also inaccessible. MTD erase nvram didn&#039;t work. firstboot didn&#039;t work. I could find no easy way to recover this box.</p><p>In the end, I ordered the SCHMartBoard RS232-TTL converter ($15). I removed the header pins from an old SB16 sound card (circa 1996) and used them to solder a serial header and Jtag header to the router PCB. I then crafted from some old cd-rom sound cables a wire harness to go between the serial port and converter.&nbsp; It all worked on the first try! </p><p>Once I had access to the serial console, it was just a matter of hitting CTRL-C at power up to get to CFE (REDBOOT&gt;) command mode, start up the TFTP daemon (REDBOOT&gt; tftpd), and then use tftp from windows to upload the original factory firmware.</p><p>I couldn&#039;t have done any of this without the information in this and other threads.<br />Thanks again for sharing your knowledge so that others can benefit!</p><p>Doug.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>doug80638</strong> on 10 Dec 2009, 02:47)</p>

I&#039;m stuck and getting the same errors :S, I flashed the WRT54GR with openwrt-rdc-jffs2-64k-ar525w.img using tftp, I enabled the wifi but with no avail, thus I couldn&#039;t flash back the stock firmware, tried several time using tftp and from inside the X-wrt : (&nbsp; I&#039;m able ssh the router and I still can connect to it from the web.. Should I now use the TTL converter or there&#039;s another trick that I&#039;ve missed in the forum to flash it back?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ramx2</strong> on 30 Mar 2010, 14:18)</p>

					<p>I own WRT54GR too.</p><p>I tried different openwrt and xwrt builds including the latest 10.03.1-rc1 but with no luck. Error was always the same. The router was completely inaccessible from ethernet interface both at my custom ip and at 192.168.1.1 So I couldn&#039;t reflash without serial interface. Once I soldered TTL to RS232 converter using this scheme: <a href="http://picprojects.org.uk/projects/simpleSIO/ssio.htm">http://picprojects.org.uk/projects/simpleSIO/ssio.htm</a> (page seems to be dead write if you need the scheme) and mounted using instructions on this site I saw in the log that the boot process stoped at <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mem_size: 1000000</code></pre></div><p>The only build I managed to get running was kamikaze x-wrt jffs2-64k (can&#039;t remember exact version) but it didn&#039;t support wireless interface correctly.</p><p>Finally I flashed with the manufacturers default firmware and got the routed working again.</p><p>I would really like to get <span class="bbu">OpenWRT</span> working.
