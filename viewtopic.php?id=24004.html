					<p>I am not sure any ADSL routers are supported as there would have to be driver support for the ADSL chipset and ATM drivers ect.</p><p>I could be wrong though.</p><p>The best way would be to use an ADSL Modem such as a Speedtoch 510v6 in proxyarp mode connected to a Openwrt capable router. If you need a hand with that let me know I have set it up before and it worked well. Another option would be using DHCP spoof but I prefer the proxyarp setup.</p>									</div>

					<p>If your provider doesn&#039;t give you ADSL2(+) IMHO the best solution is a USB ADSL Modem like speedtouch 330 or some ueagle compatible (Sagem ?, etc). Of course you need USB in your Openwrt router, but you can get rid off a power cable.<br />I also use a SAGEM Fast 1200 but connected via ethernet. BTW I bricked a Speedtouch 510v6 trying to configure it with Static IP an RFC1483 routed like the 1200. Has anyone debricked such device? Both 1200 and 510v6 support ADSL2(+)</p>									</div>
