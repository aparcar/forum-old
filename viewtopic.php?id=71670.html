					<p>I was reading up on AutoAP for DD WRT and it seems that the development work moved to Open WRT, but there has not been much discussion about it lately, and it doesn&#039;t seem to be complete. Am I missing something. I&#039;d like to build a wireless repeater for both opens and secure wireless networks to use in my RV. Any direction for me on this?</p>									</div>
