					<p>Hi there, i apologize if this is in the wrong section. Im very new to networking setup, and while iv had experience with website design coding iv found this is a whole different kettle of fish to understand. Im hoping for advice or suggestions to assist me with my goal.</p><p>My goal is to setup my Linksys Router (WRT1900ac) with website logging for each individual device on my router, but i assume running an IP connection through another program may result in slight slower streaming, aswell as logging of irrelevant data would take space,&nbsp; i would like to have it set up so that the devices which are used for streaming and gaming only - and do not have access to internet browsers - (our 3 PS4 consoles) are able to Bypass the monitoring system, while all other computers, laptops, tablets and phones connected to our router are directed through a monitoring/logging&nbsp; system</p><p>So far regarding monitoring the standard software which comes with the linksys router has been nothing but disappointing. One can only Block certain websites, and i believe their is a maximum, and trying to block all inappropriate addresses using only 10 slots is impossible and completely pointless.</p><p>So following advise on various threads and forums i have installed openWRT on my router. I thought once installing openWRT on the router the settings and options would be all there for me to set-up, and now i see i am wrong and need to configure alot of options and possibly add additional packages to have openWRT do as i require. </p><p>So first of all, i believe i will have to create two pathways in which devices can reach the internet - One will include the devices i dont need monitored, and the other will have the devices i do wished to be monitored. However i am a little confused as the router has a 5gz connection and a 2.4g connection, will each device that has the ability to connect with 5gz AND 2.4g require two Fixed Ip addresses? </p><p>Do i create the two seperate pathways to the internet using routes? </p><p>If anyone can advise me on what i will need to install and configure to obtain my goal i would be most appreciative, even links to tutorials, programs etc is always helpful.<br />Thank you for reading,<br />Steph</p>									</div>

					<p>Google tells me that PS4s come with A Webbrowser. So excluding these will probably not work. Also you could configure a computer to use a PS4s MAC and IP address, so what ever you do you should most likely not exclude any device. Either your monitoring is &#039;universal&#039; or not worth the hassle <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />I have no input about the actual monitoring, except asking what is the real goal you want to achieve?</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>
