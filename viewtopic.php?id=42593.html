					<p>As of now, I have the following setup on my openwrt :</p><p>lan0 (wlan0 and wired ports) : 192.168.0.x<br />lan1 (wlan1) : 192.168.1.x</p><p>lan0 is for printers, mythtv backend, and fileserver (smb), and for parent network access<br />lan1 is for the kids</p><p>I would like to allow the kids to access the machines on lan0, (and vice versa). But still have them kept on a seperate subnet / wireless network. So we are able to control their internet habits (no internet after 10pm, or if they have homework to do)</p><p>I have developed firewall scripts for lan1, that enables / disables internet for computers on that lan, based on their MAC addresses (When disabled they can still go to the schools intranet pages, for homework, but everything else is redirected to a local webserver that displays a default splash page)</p><p>In the future I might add another lan to the setup, for all the media centers in the house, just to keep them seperate from everything else, these should also have access to the servers in lan0.</p><p>Any hints?</p><p>/ Thomas</p>									</div>
