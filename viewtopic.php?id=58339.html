					<p>Hello,</p><p>I own a TP-Link TL-WR841N v9 and I wanted to try OpenWRT.<br />I read the Wiki on this model and read some more pages on the internet about this.</p><p>In order to avoid the GUI (Luci) flashing part I decided to do the following:<br />- I flashed the factory image of v14.07 from Barrier Breaker &quot;openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr841n-v9-squashfs-factory.bin&quot;;<br />- I flashed the sysupgrade image of v15.05 from Chaos Calmer RC2 &quot;openwrt-15.05-rc2-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr841n-v9-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin&quot;.</p><p>My router boots and the Ethernet light blinks.<br />But I cannot access to it through &quot;<a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a>&quot; GUI or through the command: &quot;telnet 192.168.1.1&quot;.</p><p>I am new in this scene, but I want to learn as much as I can.<br />So, can you help me with this.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p><p>Best regards.</p>									</div>

					<p>You cannot use the same IP address on the router and your PC. Change the address on the PC or use DHCP. Connect your PC to the router with a cable to one of the lan ports. If your router works and your&#039;re using DHCP, then you should have got an address for your PC. Then try telnet.</p>									</div>
