					<p>Hi everybody,</p><p>approximately for 2 months&nbsp; I have been dealing with openwrt on netgear wndr-3800. Interestingly one of the component,conntrack, seems to not work. Actually all modes such as list,update, etc mode function well, however when we come &quot;event mode, it is called like conntrack -E&quot; there is any reaction on the screen and the flow count is illustrated as 0. In order to be&nbsp; able to work in event mode, conntrack needs indeed libnfnetlink module which is also defined while installing. Such components are also installed, but again the same scenario!. I have utilized the different images from kernel version 2.6.32 (image on openwrt website) to kernel 3.3.8.1(my Image), again no response. I know or feels that there is a problem with kernel modules (kmod-nf-netlink-conntrack), but I cannot propose a solution. </p><p>May be you can say the kernel version is smaller than the version defined in Install page of conntrack,but I checked it too. </p><p> Any idea?</p><p>Cem</p>									</div>
