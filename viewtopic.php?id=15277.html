					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m having trouble getting into failsafe mode on my wrt54GL (which sucks, because I set a password, and now both telnet and ssh are no longer working).</p><p>In the docs it says that once the DMZ light goes on, I should press the reset button for 2-3 seconds OR (another wiki page) says I should just hit any button multiple times...<br />Problem is, DMZ light never goes on.<br />Yes, the wrt works fine, with radius auth etc.. I can connect to the wireless network etc.. it&#039;s not bricked.</p><p>So, then I tried the other way.. apparently it broadcasts an UDP packet, and once i saw that (like.. &#039;press reset now blabla&#039; or something) I pressed and hold the reset button for several seconds, and another time I tried hitting it forever (hit, hit hit hit hit). But it just boots up normally (not with 192.168.1.1, but the configured address and everything, telnet/ssh connection refused).<br />Oh yeah, I *don&#039;t* get a second udp packet with like &#039;booting now in failsafe mode&#039;</p><p>So, hmm, any hints?</p><p>It&#039;s kamikaze 7.09 btw.</p><p>TIA.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>siesop</strong> on 12 Apr 2008, 20:45)</p>

					<p>i dont&#039; have your platform but if xwrt works you can go and see if in etc/rc.d there is a file Sxxdropbear where xx i think it&#039;s 50, don&#039;t know for sure. if it&#039;s not (very weird), then edit the file custom-start-up in /etc/init.d/ and add a line that says:</p><p>dropbear -p 22</p><p>save, apply and reboot.</p><p>hope this helps</p>									</div>

					<p>forum2008: yes, this is what I tried.<br />Wodin: ok, thanks for the info... then I&#039;ll no longer consider that &#039;strange&#039; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />. <br />dlbogdan: I&#039;ll check, but IIRC I got a 404 when surfing to the box (so http is running, but.. hmm..).</p><p>still, i wonder why i&#039;m having so much trouble getting into failsafe. I&#039;ll try multiple times again in a couple of days, pressing reset for minute, but.. i have little hope..</p>									</div>
