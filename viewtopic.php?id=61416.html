					<p>I didn&#039;t see much talk about the WRT1900ACS happening but after checking out <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1900acs">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1900acs</a> decided it looked similar enough to my WRT1900AC v2. The WRT1900AC v2 firmware flashed fine and no trouble to report there, but my ISP requires my WAN traffic to be on a separate VLAN and for some reason it just wouldn&#039;t make it happen. It couldn&#039;t seem to acquire an IP via DHCP.</p><p>It&#039;s interesting to note that the VLAN tagging and DHCP did work fine on the WRT1900AC v2. It was perfect and running within just 2 minutes or so from flash to finish.</p><p>So just a heads up to those who are considering it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> I&#039;m kind of bummed because I was looking forward to OpenWRT on it but I have limited time to play with getting it to work correctly. If someone has a fix I&#039;d love to hear about it! I didn&#039;t see any interesting errors in luci just that it was trying to acquire via DHCP repeatedly.</p><p>Fingers crossed the ACS gains popularity, dual core 1.6GHz... rawr</p>									</div>
