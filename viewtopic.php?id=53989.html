					<p>Greetings,</p><p>I have been running the stable Barrier Breaker for my Archer C7 V2 for about as long as it&#039;s has been available. Seemingly randomly my archer c7 v2 stopped working yesterday.</p><p>It now assigns 164.254.62.134 as ip but no default gateway. I&#039;ve been unable to access it via telnet/ssh/or luci. I&#039;ve tried manually assigning ip as my old scheme 172.31.77.x that did nothing, I tried manually assigning the default ip scheme 192.168.1.x that didn&#039;t help either.</p><p>I initially thought it just overheated as when I touched it after it stopped working it was hot, I let it cool overnight, nothing changed.</p><p>I don&#039;t own a jtag and I&#039;m uncertain which one I&#039;d need for my device. Would I have to open up the router to use a jtag?</p><p>I&#039;ve looked over the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.debrick">generic debricking guide</a>, I&#039;m not sure where my router is failing.</p><p>Hopefully one of you knows some quick/easy solution for me. If not, hopefully one of you can tell me which jtag I need to order. Thanks for any time/effort.</p><p>EDIT: I forgot to mention, wifi never initializes.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Anon28435</strong> on 13 Nov 2014, 19:27)</p>

					<p>try getting into failsafe mode to reset to defaults. otherwise, some TP-Link routers have a recovery mode to flash something new if you truly think it&#039;s bricked, but it doesn&#039;t sound like a brick to me since there was no failed flash involved.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve tried and failed to get into fail-safe mode. I tried both methods listed <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe">here</a>.</p><p>I attempted to access <a href="https://www.mikepalmer.net/tp-link-archer-c7-ac1750-v2-tftp-recovery/">recovery mode</a> with no luck.</p><p>I believe I have a unrelated(to OpenWRT) hardware issue and am attempting RMA.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Anon28435</strong> on 14 Nov 2014, 04:29)</p>
