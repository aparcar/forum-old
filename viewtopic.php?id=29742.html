					<p>Surely I&#039;m wrong, but it appears that I am getting memory leaks simply from appending to a log file. I would greatly appreciate input as I&#039;m not really understanding what is going on here.</p><p>I&#039;m using Kamikaze 8.09.2 on a Gateworks &#039;Cambria Network Platform&#039;</p><p>I&#039;ve been working on a project that keeps running out of memory. Sometimes it has been due to Madwifi driver leaks, but at other times, it appears to be because I am appending to a large log file. I ran the following script to test my theory:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/ash
while [ 1 ]
do
  free | awk /Mem/&#039;{print $4}&#039; | tee memory.txt -a
done</code></pre></div><p>And I can watch as the free memory (slowly) deteriorates. The same happens if using the append operator (&gt;&gt;) instead of tee.</p><p>I would have thought this was because the OS was, for some reason, loading the entire file in order to append it, using more memory as the file gets larger. However, after terminating the script, the memory is not returned. This indicates a kernel level leak, doesn&#039;t it? What is going on here!?!</p>									</div>

					<p>@jow - It&#039;s not /tmp, It&#039;s the home folder /root/</p><p>I get that, in principle, there is no reason for the memory to be freed, but this brings up two questions for me:<br />1) Why is more and more memory getting requested and cached?<br />2) Is there a way to check if the OS knows this memory is not being presently used and could be freed? When too much memory is used, it can slow down the router. But if memory is not freed for the speculative chance it might be useful in the future, it shouldn&#039;t slow the router because it could just write over that memory, right? How can I as a user tell the difference between these types of non-freed memory?</p><p>As for reading up, I have an exam on this stuff on Thursday, so I will be <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Linux will free ram used for IO caches immediately if a program requests more memory. So when checking the output of &quot;top&quot; or &quot;free&quot; you actually have to substract buffer and caches from the &quot;used memory&quot; figure when judging the free / used ram ratio.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, I think I&#039;m understanding now. Thanks a ton guys!</p><p>When I was appending to a log file, the kernel caches what I appended, just trying to be useful. This makes `free` diminish, but if you watch it over time, the memory usage approaches about 75%. Past that point, it starts to free up the memory so that performance isn&#039;t hindered. So yeah, this isn&#039;t a leak, nor a problem. This &#039;used&#039; memory is freed if it is ever needed. I can see this by `cat /proc/meminfo`. After appending a log for a long time, the &quot;Cached&quot; value and &quot;Inactive&quot; value are both really high (presumably mostly overlap), accounting for basically all of the used memory. In this way, it is clear that this action of repeatedly appending a file will not crash the board by using too much memory. So my original concern was misplaced.</p><p>For anyone as curious as I, I will elaborate a bit. When using malloc to eat a ton of memory, the Active value in /proc/meminfo increased. The OS will not free active memory. This type of memory leak can cause your program to be terminated by the Kernel if it uses too much memory. If you trigger a memory leak in the kernel or in a driver, you can watch as Slab, and specifically SUnreclaim increase. This indicates that unreclaimable memory structures in the kernel level are using more and more memory. This type of memory leak, because it is not associated with a process, will not result in the OOM killing the process. In this way, a program may repeatedly trigger a driver-level leak, allocate basically all the memory in an unreclaimable way, and make the board essentially non-responsive and unable to stop the problem. This last case is what I was originally experiencing and started me on this whole investigation thingy.</p><p>Assuming this understanding is correct, I&#039;m off to Google about my next problem: How to tell when a reboot is needed due to memory leaks in the madwifi driver? I can see the memory used by the leak in SUnreclaim, but I&#039;m not sure how to tell how large I can safely let that value grow... to the Google!</p><p>(again, thanks guys!)</p>									</div>
