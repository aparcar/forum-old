					<p>Well, you get all the features of OpenWrt in general of course - extremely stable firmware that&#039;s extensible to do just about anything you want. I use it for the stability and the superb QoS personally. Lots of people use it to enable their router to act as a file sharing device or print server. You also get a consistent interface and feature set across devices. </p><p>Stock is probably easier to use, but that&#039;s about it&#039;s only advantage. I suppose hardware NAT is one feature lost in OpenWrt because current implementations from the manufacturers are not compatible with certain parts of OpenWrt.</p>									</div>

					<p>The Archer C5/C7 use a fairly new chipset, so full support is still being implemented. For the most stable hardware/software combination, I&#039;d like at an 802.11n router. Most people really don&#039;t take advantage of 802.11ac speeds anyway. I believe it does work reasonably well on the Archer C5/C7 though, although probably better in the upcoming Chaos Calmer release.</p><p>Guest network is not a built-in feature unfortunately. I have argued that it should be.
