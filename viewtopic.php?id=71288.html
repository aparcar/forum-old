					<p>Hello,</p><p>i want to change the page which is shown after successful login on the LUCI webinterface. Normally there is the overview page shown but i need to show an other page first.</p><p>So my question is how to change this default page to another page. I changed several other pages and also add new pages but i have no plan how to change the default page after login but i really need to change it.</p><p>I also checked the /usr/lib/lua/luci folder but didn´t find any entry for it.</p><p>I run the default LUCI Webinterface for OpenWrt DD-r4851.</p><p>I hope somebody can help me.</p><p>Thanks in advance</p><p>Patrick</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>i played a bit around and searched for possible solution but still can´t find a way to change the page.<br />After some research i found the file /usr/lib/lua/luci/dispatcher.lua with a function called build_url(...)<br />which looks like this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>function build_url(...)
    local path = {...}
    local url = { http.getenv(&quot;SCRIPT_NAME&quot;) or &quot;&quot; }

    local p
    for _, p in ipairs(path) do
        if p:match(&quot;^[a-zA-Z0-9_%-%.%%/,;]+$&quot;) then
            url[#url+1] = &quot;/&quot;
            url[#url+1] = p
        end
    end

    if #path == 0 then
        url[#url+1] = &quot;/&quot;
    end

    return table.concat(url, &quot;&quot;)
end</code></pre></div><p>so i tested and changed für example the local url&nbsp; to {/cgi-bin/luci/admin/system/mypage} and restarted my system.<br />After reboot i was able to log in and the page appeared but no other page was working so this wasn´t my solution.</p><p>So i guess i have to find the file which calls this function after login and change the url there.<br />If someone have an idea let me know.</p><p>Greetings </p><p>Patrick</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry was a busy the last week,</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>My guess about the key files that leady to admin/status/overview getting displayed by default:<br /><a href="https://github.com/openwrt/luci/blob/ma">https://github.com/openwrt/luci/blob/ma</a> … /index.lua<br /><a href="https://github.com/openwrt/luci/blob/ma">https://github.com/openwrt/luci/blob/ma</a> … status.lua</p><p>If you replace the path components (admin, status, overview) on this line:</p><br /><p>entry({&quot;admin&quot;, &quot;status&quot;}, alias(&quot;admin&quot;, &quot;status&quot;, &quot;overview&quot;), _(&quot;Status&quot;), 20).index = true</p><p>with the patch components of the page that you want to display, I guess that it will display that page by default.</p></blockquote></div><p>thought the same before and tried it but i remember that when i did this i fully lost the overview page. It´s now a week ago i tested some things and also i remember that on this way(but could also happened on another way i tested) i got some Problems with the authentication. So i logged in and was able to see the custom page but my next problem was when i changed to another page i was redirected to the login page and end up in a loop of the custom and the login page.</p><p>If i find another solution i will post it here</p>									</div>
