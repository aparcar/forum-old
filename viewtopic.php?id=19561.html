					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I had a 2.4 kernel setup on my WL500gDeluxe, which was working as &#039;wireless bridge&#039;. I put wlan0 and eth0.0 in a bridge (wlan0 was in STA mode connected to AP). All clients from both networks (wifi and lan) were able to see eachother. I had the whole firewall disabled and all ip_tables related modules were not loaded.</p><p>Due to some USB problems I updated to 2.6 kernel. The b43 is somehow working, from the router I can ping the AP through wlan0. I am using the same configuration files as in 2.4 but I can&#039;t get the Client1 from LAN on the router get to the other side of the bridge (AP or Client2) and vice versa. I disabled firewall and all ip_tables modules.<br />So, this is the situation:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>+----+    WiFi   +---------+    LAN    +---------+
| AP |  &lt;-----&gt;  | OpenWRT |  &lt;-----&gt;  | Client1 |
+----+           +---------+           +---------+
  ^
  | WiFi
  |
  v
+---------+
| Client2 |
+---------+</code></pre></div><p>I want to have Client1 and Client2 both in the same network, so that&#039;s why I put wlan0 and eth0.0 in the bridge on openWRT. The brctl shows the bridge. Later I can post full configs. Strange is that under 2.4 kernel this worked fine.</p><p>I can ping AP from openwrt, as well as OpenWRT from client1 and client2.</p>									</div>

					<p>Seems that someone already had this issue, see <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/openwrt-users@lists.openwrt.org/msg00443.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/openwrt-use … 00443.html</a><br />Is the wireless bridge even possible? Are there any other solutions? I just want to get to the whole network from CLIENT1 and I want to be able to get to CLIENT1 from CLIENT2. Bridge just seemed to be the easiest because I don&#039;t have to do any routing etc.</p>									</div>

					<p>Does anyone have an idea how to fix it or where to look? In 2.4 the bridge was working.<br />Can I somehow &quot;emulate&quot; the bridge? I will only have one client PC on the LAN side of openwrt machine. I was thinking about something like DMZ</p>									</div>
