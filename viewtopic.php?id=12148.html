					<p>Hi forum,</p><p>I have a problem with wireless encryption on my Asus WL-700gE. I tried everything but neither WEP nor WPA encryption seems to work. However, setting encryption to none enables me at least to get connected to the router but the bridge between wl0 and lan does not work. I can only ping the router, no other wired host in the network.</p><p>Anyway, my goal is to set up a WPA2-PSK AES encryption. But whenever my windows client tries to connect to the box it first establishes a connection but after a few seconds the connection is broken up again. During the short time in between I can&#039;t ping the WL-700gE. Any help on this would be very appreciated.</p><p>My /etc/config/wireless goes as follows:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-device              wl0

					<p>Well, thanks anyway. I&#039;ve already removed the hostapd-mini package.</p><p>So far WEP seems to work. I think something went wrong with the encryption key when I tried first. But I still don&#039;t have WPA/WPA2. What bothers me most is that the iwlist and wpa_supplicant outputs seem to be okay but there is no chance to connect. I&#039;ve tried with several computers now running serveral OSes (XP, Vista, Ubuntu).</p><p>Is anyone aware of an alternative OS for the WL-700gE with the flexibility of openwrt?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hejira</strong> on 25 Aug 2007, 09:29)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m had the same issue and also wonder why we seem to be alone here.</p><p>Well I dug a little deeper than you did:</p><p>What I found out: no encryption works for me under a windows xp client trying to connect to a wl500gx kamikaze7.09.<br />What does work: but ONLY after a REBOOT. Changes in Settings alone don&#039;t suffice(eg. change from wpa to no encryption) are wireless non encrypted, and ethernet.</p><p>Sad, very sad. Linux clients have no problems at all. it&#039;s only the win boxes.</p><p>After doing a very in depth tcp dump session, I found, that there is litterally no communication whatsoever at the associaton/ip-getting procedure over the communicating interface (eg. wl0). only one thing:</p><p>15:58:50.865422 00:13:d3:5d:81:48 (oui Unknown) &gt; Broadcast Null Unnumbered, xid, Flags [Command], length 6: 01 00</p><p>the mac adress is the win box<br />so there is no dhc discover/offer/request or anything the like.</p><p>So i found it: &gt;&gt;Zonealarm&lt;&lt; just blocked it all.</p><p>The problem why it worked after a reboot only: the network interface was started before the userspace program Zonealarm.</p><p>Pretty nasty, isn&#039;t it.</p><p>Anyway, I HOPE this helps someone</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ye_old</strong> on 27 Sep 2008, 18:25)</p>
