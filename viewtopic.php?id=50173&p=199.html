I rolled back to a previous build (4.0.0-rc7) and it has been 99% reliable with small hiccups that do not require reboots just patience. While 4.0.1 has been better when it comes to lock ups compared to 3.18.11 it still suffers from them and hard reboots are required. Just my 2 cents on the issue. I&#039;m not sure if it is the wireless driver or the kernel but during hiccups i encountered there were logs that referenced nftables and some problem with odhcp reassignment (another problem i&#039;ve been experiencing is clients dc then reconnect). </p><p>I&#039;ll have ample time this week so i could test builds or record logs. </p><p>PS: When the router locked up i tried using the tty connection but it would not connect. so the usb is active, screen opens a terminal, but the terminal is empty and pressing enter or any other keys does nothing. </p><p>All the best,</p><p>lifehacksback</p></blockquote></div><br /><p>@lifehacksback,</p><p>I just experienced my first lockup with 4.0.1 ironically this evening. I couldn&#039;t troubleshoot it as I am on the road and only found out when I got a call from my wife that the Internet was down. I have to agree with what you have said and plan to back to 4.0.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tusc</strong> on 12 May 2015, 02:41)</p>

					<p>Question for you all.<br />Has anyone set up guest wifi on OpenWrt, on our router?<br />I&#039;ve got things all set up so that wired and wifi hosts/clients (both 2.4Ghz &amp; 5ghz), can all see each other (on the 192.168.1.x subnet), and have access to the internet connection.&nbsp; It&#039;s all working perfectly.</p><p>I would now like to configure a second SSID on the 2.4Ghz radio to allow guests access to the internet (via the same internet connection as above).&nbsp; However, I do not want guests to be able to see any of the hosts on the 192.168.1.x subnet.</p><p>I was thinking I would set up the guest wifi network on a 192.168.2.x subnet.&nbsp; But, can&#039;t quite work out the related configs to make it all work.&nbsp; Has anyone done something like this?&nbsp; Could you please share your /etc/config files?</p>									</div>

To make a very long story short, I tracked the source of interference (which appeared to be jamming the router) as coming from an HDMI transmitter that I have installed nearby.

Now I cannot explain the freezes after some 24 hours of stable operation. I can&#039;t get in via wireless or wired connection when it goes down.
