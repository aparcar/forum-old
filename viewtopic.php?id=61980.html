					<p>Ok I am new to openwrt....... I flashed my tp-link wdr3600 and I can log into web interface perfectly.....set password time and date and all that stuff........ and now I&#039;ll tell you about my setup and what I wanna do.</p><p>I have two separate vlans on my LAN..... vlan 6 (guest) and vlan 10 (private).....vlan 1 is used for switches.</p><p>I am using a sonic wall router as my firewall and dhcp server which has a trunk port setup with vlan 1,6,10 that connects to a trunk port on a cisco switch...... than from that cisco switch there is another trunk port set up with vlan 1,6,10 that I want to connect to my tp-link router with openwrt fw.</p><p>I then want to have the Ethernet ports on tp-link router part of vlan 10 (I know I will need to use one for a trunk port) &quot;can I use the wan port for the trunk????&quot;</p><p>I also want to have two separate wifi ssids, one for guest network (vlan 6) and one from private network (vlan 10) and yes I know how to create multiple wifi ssids in openwrt web interface.</p><p>The tp-link router will not be a dhcp server for ANY vlan.. ip addresses will all come from SonicWALL which has been configured already.</p><p>What is confusing me is this..........I go into &quot;interfaces&quot; in openwrt web interface and I am wondering exactly what interfaces do I need? <br />one for vlan 6<br />one for vlan 10<br />my wifi<br />switchport<br />anything else?</p><p>ok and now I go into configure the switch.....</p><p>port 1 is wan port, <br />port 2 is port 1 on router,<br /> port 3 is port 2 on router, <br />port 4 is port 3 on router, <br />port 5 is port 4 on router <br />and than there is the cpu</p><p>what vlans do I need? <br />there is already a vlan 1 and vlan 2 created...... can I delete vlan 2?</p><p>I created vlan 6 and vlan 10</p><p>so now I have <br />vlan 1<br />vlan 6<br />vlan 10</p><p>ok now I want to use port 4 on router (port 5 in open wrt) and my trunk that will connect to my trunk port on cisco switch (or can I configure wan port to work for this?)</p><p>I want the rest of the ports to be part of vlan 10 (private network)</p><p>so my understanding is this......<br />all vlans should be &quot;tagged&quot; on cpu and my trunk port &quot;port 5&quot;<br />every other port should be off on all vlans except on vlan 10 where they should all be &quot;untagged&quot; correct??</p><p>and now my wireless</p><p>I created two ssids........<br />one called guest<br />one called private</p><p>do I simply bridge <br />guest with vlan 6<br />and private with vlan 10 </p><p>please help me out.. thanks a million</p>									</div>

You don&#039;t have to assign an IP address to the interface if you don&#039;t want to. The ethernet bridge will work anyway and forward packets between the physical interfaces of the bridge. (Of course you need at least one IP address for configuring openwrt.)</p>									</div>
