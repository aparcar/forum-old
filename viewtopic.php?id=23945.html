					<p>I have the same question.<br />Playing with the telnet session I have seen some differences between DGN2000 and DG834Gv4. For example wifi chipset is broadcomm, not Atheros.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry for bumping such an old thread, but I&#039;d like to have OpenWRT on my DGN2000 too. Hardware-wise it looks very similar to DGN834Gv4. I did a diff between the original 834v4 and 2000 GPL kernel sources and they looked mostly the same. Biggest difference was in what I believe is in the mtd stuff. I created a patch between DG834Gv4_v5-01-16_src and DGN2000_v1-1-1_src mtd driver folder, see here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/jessenic/cf6050c6db5b985b0cdf">https://gist.github.com/jessenic/cf6050c6db5b985b0cdf</a> (note the DG834 directory structure in my patch differs a bit from the original)</p><p>Could someone implement/help me implement the needed changes?</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks to @sidepipe I now have working image tagger for the DGN2000. I flashed an image to it and now I believe that it&#039;s in a boot loop, network lights turning on and off. I will turn my Nokia CA-42 into a serial adapter tomorrow and see what I can get out with it.</p>									</div>
