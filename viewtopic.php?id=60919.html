					<p>I use a netgear SRX5308 for my network and one of the wan ports needs a PPPoE connection. The SRX5308 has a lot of trouble keeping up with my 100Mbit connection. The processor load is skyhigh.</p><p>The SRX5308 is configured as multiple vlans / wan connections so has to stay in the configuration.</p><p>What I want to do is setup an OpenWrt device which only acts as a PPPoE client and outputs its result to a lan port, without dhcp or NAT. So the Ip address that the PPPoE gets needs to be available on the LAN port of the OpenWrt box.</p><p>-------<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>+-----------+       +---------+         +---------+
-  Provider -       - OpenWrt -         - SRX8308 -
-  PPPoE    -  &gt; WAN- PPPoE   -LAN &gt; WAN- Router  - LAN to switch &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
-  server   -       - Client  -         - DHCP    -

+-----------+       +---------+         +---------+      -</code></pre></div><p>So the OpenWrt box has to take over the PPPoE function from the SRX5308 only.<br />The rest has to stay as it is now. <br />Does anybody has an idea how to do this?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dr-error</strong> on 14 Nov 2015, 16:36)</p>

					<p>The high CPU on your SRX8303 is probably produced by the NAT functionality, thus moving the PPPoE to another router is unlikely to be of any help.</p>									</div>
