					<p>Hi,</p><p>I want to enhance my ASUS WL-500gP (running very fine with Kamikaze 7.07) to a network scanning server with sane(d). <br />After installing sane-libs and sane-backends (and all packages needed for them), I added 192.168.23.0/24 to /etc/sane.d/saned.conf and connected the usb scanner (cannonScan Lide 25) to the usbport (yes, I also installed the usb-packages, the devices is listed by lsusb). <br />By the way: my Network is 192.168.23.0/24, the name of my Asus-WL500 is &quot;wundertuete&quot; and it runs behind a firewall (IPCOP).</p><p>I also added <br />sane-port&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6566/tcp<br />to /etc/services</p><br /><p>As a next step, I want to see, that everything is running before I prepair xinted.<br />So I started saned:<br />saned -d128<br />OUTPUT:<br />[saned] main: starting debug mode (level 128)<br />[saned] main: trying to get port for service `sane&#039; (getservbyname)<br />[saned] main: port is 6566<br />[saned] main: socket ()<br />[saned] main: setsockopt ()<br />[saned] main: bind ()<br />[saned] main: listen ()<br />[saned] main: waiting for control connection<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />So far so good.<br />If I make a telnet connection from an other console to this port (localhost connection), I got the following output:</p><p>[saned] saned from sane-backends 1.0.17 ready<br />[saned] check_host: access by remote host: 127.0.0.1<br />[saned] check_host: remote host is IN_LOOPBACK: access accepted<br />[saned] init: access granted<br />[saned] init: bad status=0 or procnum=1952805748<br />[saned] quit: exiting</p><p>seems fine. But if I make a connection from an other host, I got the following error:</p><p>[saned] saned from sane-backends 1.0.17 ready<br />[saned] check_host: access by remote host: 192.168.23.123<br />[saned] check_host: remote host is not IN_LOOPBACK<br />[saned] check_host: local hostname: wundertuete<br />[saned] check_host: gethostbyname failed: Success<br />[saned] init: access by host 192.168.23.123 denied<br />[saned] quit: exiting</p><p>The strange thing is the line: <br />[saned] check_host: gethostbyname failed: Success. <br />192.168.23.123 is my client, and it is included in 192.168.23.0/24.<br />A normal and reverse lookup of his name is also possible. I tryed hours for hours to solve the problem, but I got no single step ahead. I also wrote 192.168.23.123 to /etc/sane.d/saned.conf.</p><p>I tryed to link the saned.conf to a different place (e.g. /usr/local/etc/sane.d/saned.conf), but no difference. I looks like the sane daemon does not look to the config file, because after deleting the file, I canÂ´t see any difference. </p><p>So any ideas?</p><p>Robert</p>									</div>

					<p>I had the exact same problem -- SANE worked under Kamikaze 7.06, but under 7.09 it was broken. After letting it kick my butt for about 4 hours, I came across your post. It lead me to some troubleshooting steps. (My troubleshooting was aided by the fact that I have 2 Kamikaze devices - one running 7.06 the other 7.09.)</p><p>On the 7.06 device, Saned was detecting the hostname properly:<br />root@nas:/etc# saned -d128<br />[saned] main: starting debug mode (level 128)<br />[saned] main: trying to get port for service `sane&#039; (getservbyname)<br />[saned] main: port is 6566<br />[saned] main: socket ()<br />[saned] main: setsockopt ()<br />[saned] main: bind ()<br />[saned] main: listen ()<br />[saned] main: waiting for control connection<br />[saned] saned from sane-backends 1.0.17 ready<br />[saned] check_host: access by remote host: 10.240.5.254<br />[saned] check_host: remote host is not IN_LOOPBACK<br />[saned] check_host: local hostname: nas</p><p>However, on the 7.09 device, it kept detecting the hostname was &quot;OpenWrt,&quot; but in fact it was set as &quot;server&quot; in my hosts file. I figured there must be a bug with the way Sane is detecting the hostname, so I changed /etc/hosts from:<br />127.0.0.1 localhost.<br />10.240.5.1 server</p><p>to:<br />127.0.0.1 localhost.<br />10.240.5.1 server OpenWrt</p><p>I couldn&#039;t believe it when that worked! Basically, I just added the hostname OpenWrt and everything worked!</p><p>Hope that helps.</p><p>Best regards,<br />Russel</p>									</div>

					<p>Okay, instead of my poorly implemented workaround, it&#039;s better to just edit /etc/config/system and change:</p><p>config system<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option hostname OpenWrt</p><p>to<br />config system<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option hostname YourHostName</p><p>Anyway, it works for me.<br />--Russel</p>									</div>
