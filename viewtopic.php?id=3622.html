					<p>Hello! I&#039;ve been using RC4 for sometime now and I must say I extremely happy with it! Here is my problem: I just bought a brand new Palm T|X. This beauty has a builtin wlan card that allows it to connect to a wireless router. That is all fine, and it works on many access points in my work, but I cannot make it work with router. It is a Lynksys WRT54G v3.1 with OpenWRT RC4 installed. I&#039;ve tried many things already:</p><p>logging through IP tables:</p><p>Although I can see DHCP requests for all the other computers in my network (3 wireless devices besides the PDA), I get NO packet in from the PALM.</p><p>using kismet to passively monitor the wireless network, when I click &quot;connect&quot; at the palm, I can see this flushing:</p><p>10:06:22 - 00:0B:6C:4E:05:8A MANAGEMENT (Probe Request a2)</p><p>This is the correct mac address from the palm. So, I can see the poor guy is sending &quot;probes&quot; to the network, but the router never answers/detects that. It is like it doesn&#039;t sense the packets in the network. </p><p>I&#039;ve tried changing wireless channels and other little stuff, but I&#039;m running out of options here to understand why OpenWRT/my router cannot talk to the Palm.</p><p>Is there some magick I can try?</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, just got the problem now. My &quot;wl_maclist&quot; was too restrictive to let the PDA to connect... This probably even diserves an FAQ entry, I guess it should be pretty common.</p><p>Thanks anyway and keep up the good work!</p>									</div>
