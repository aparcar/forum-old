					<p>&gt;Does anyone knows why mwan3 and coova-chilli does not work well together?&lt;<br />coova-chilli creates a pseudo interface tun on which it operates. This is a tunnel (connection) betwenn phys interface (eth0) and coova SW.<br />This allows throtteling upstream and downstream traffic. </p><p>Dunno mwan3, but at first glance it messes around with iptables and routing, which interferes with coova, which also uses quite a few iptables rules, i.e. for dhcp.</p><p>In case, you can do some type of bonding eth0 and eth2 together into one single pseudo-interface, you should get what you want.</p><p>Alternative:<br />Depending upon the acceptable blackout time of internet conn, you might consider to ping the active wan-interface (eth0) and re-configure coova-chilli using eth2 as wan, in case ping times out.<br />And switch back to eth0, in case ping works again.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>augustus_meyer</strong> on 14 Feb 2016, 23:02)</p>
