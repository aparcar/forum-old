					<p>Hi guys thought I&#039;d put this question in.</p><p>Can AutoAP run on OpenWRT if so which one should I get? The Firmware should have the capability of locking in a script and grabbing files off the internet to install on the router. I&#039;m not too sure if this is a possibility this is why I&#039;m asking. Thanks for any info you can give me. AutoAP can be found on Sourceforge with the code. If anyone is interested. Should be a matter of changing commands is all. I&#039;m just a programming novice. Anyway what AutoAP does is scans the surrounding range of the router for unsecured Routers and Strongest Signal and latches onto it mimicking the router it finds ie.. SSID. Then you can log onto your router via wireless also and browse the net etc also bridge the connection to your lan ports. Thanks again for any info.</p><p>Dantin</p><p>P.S. My Router is a Linksys wrt54gs v7 with 16MB Main and 2MB Flash. Wired for SD Card reader with 1GB of ram. Thanks again.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Dachha2</strong> on 19 May 2008, 02:05)</p>
