					<p>Hi Guys,</p><p>now - i have all of my 3 TP-Link 1043ND running with OpenWRT and im really happy. It&#039;s rock solid, really good Performance - can&#039;t be better <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Only thing i can&#039;t get to work: WLAN-Roaming for my wireless attached client devices!</p><p>I&#039;ve configured my 3 Devices like this, all with the same password:</p><p>Router [Cellar]:<br />192.168.168.1<br />Wired to the local Network<br />DHCP: Yes<br />Firewall: Yes<br />Mode: 802.11g+n<br />ESSID: #wlan<br />Freq: 40Mhz<br />Channel: 2 + Above<br />Enc: WPA2 Personal - AES Forced</p><br /><p>AP 1 [First Floor]:<br />192.168.168.2<br />Wired to the local Network<br />DHCP: No<br />Firewall: No<br />Mode: 802.11g+n<br />ESSID: #wlan<br />Freq: 40Mhz<br />Channel: 7 + Above<br />Enc: WPA2 Personal - AES Forced</p><p>AP 2 [Second Floor]:<br />192.168.168.3<br />Wired to the local Network<br />DHCP: No<br />Firewall: No<br />Mode: 802.11g+n<br />ESSID: #wlan<br />Freq: 40Mhz<br />Channel: 11 + Below<br />Enc: WPA2 Personal - AES Forced</p><br /><br /><p>Wireless devices are Ipad&#039;s, Android Smartphones, Android Pads, Notebooks etc. - no one is able to roam to the stronger wireless device!</p><p>The biggest Problem is that you can have a signal to the Router in the cellar, even if you are on the second floor - but it&#039;s really really a bad signal, but good enough for no automatic connection lost ^^ So i have to deactive/activate wlan manually!</p><p>I&#039;ve googled already a bit around but haven&#039;t found a solution for my problem ... maybe someone here can help me.</p><p>big thanks<br />iZzy</p>									</div>

					<p>I think it&#039;s not!</p><p>Because every device is worked as a FAT AP,the 802.11 MAC layer is done in every individual device.<br />The solution is AC+FIT AP,every device(FIT AP)just work as a radio,many MAC layer thing go the AC.</p><p>I hope one day some cool guys can start a AC+AP project based on openwrt and openwrt supported device,that the roaming everyone expect!</p><p>Correct me if i&#039;m wrong.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi!</p><p>I&#039;ve changed now my Network to 20 Mhz (130 Mbit/s) and used Channels 1, 6 &amp; 11.</p><p>Now it seems to be working. Smartphones, Ipad&#039;s are roaming through my Access Points. Im Just going from my cellar upstairs and lost 1-2 signal bars and in a few seconds the wlan signal bars are again at maximum. on my system log, i see an handover, too.</p><p>I can live with that solution at my current situation here because i have no device which can reach 300 Mbits (40 Mhz) here. Maximum is 130 Mbits and most of them 65 Mbit&#039;s, so it&#039;s okay <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
