					<p>I did a search of the forums for WZR-HP-G300NH and found a few tips, I have also read the install page located at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr-hp-g300h">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr-hp-g300h</a>.&nbsp; I suppose I am still a little lost on how stable the unit is compared to DD-WRT and the factory firmware.&nbsp; Does this unit still have multiple wireless issues with drop connections, soeed issues such as not maintaining a 300 N connection?&nbsp; Any suggestions on the best way to install for a beginner?</p>									</div>

					<p>The WZR-HP-G300NH is a pretty nice router. Did you happen to buy yours after seeing the PirateBox? As far as stability goes, I&#039;ve yet to have any problems with mine. I was running a Droopy webserver on it for a bit, and never ran into any issues then. As far as installation goes, I ended up flashing the router with an OpenWrt .bin from a DD-WRT firmware (as were the instructions on the PirateBox wiki), and it&#039;s worked just fine. A TFTP transfer would probably work just fine though.

					<p>with offical firmware the N quite good, but will hang easily when large network loading, such as BT<br />with OpenWRT/DD-WRT the N seems something wrong, at least when I connect it with my galaxy S, but it is quite stable, no single reboot for 1 month (as I will update the firmware monthly, so dunno how long can it be)</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve been running mine for almost a year now. I&#039;ve used both OpenWRT and the stock 1.76 firmware for months at a time. The stock firmware has the most reliable wireless, but OpenWRT has much more flexiblity in everything else. OpenWRT and DDWRT both seem to have somewhat unstable wireless on this unit but it does work fairly well. My guess is that the stock firmware is using a different wireless driver (maybe the official Atheros driver?) instead of the open source ATH9K driver. I don&#039;t understand why ATH9K is still unstable even after I&#039;ve seen fixes regularly mentioned.</p><p>I would be using the stock firmware if it had bittorrent seed support. I couldn&#039;t figure out how to seed without downloading first. So back to OpenWRT which has several bittorrent clients that all blow away the Buffalo app.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>swaaye</strong> on 22 Apr 2011, 04:34)</p>
