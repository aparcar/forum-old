					<p>Why don&#039;t you just set the service to listen on the WAN interface, port 443? Port forwarding is normally used to expose devices that are behind NAT, the router isn&#039;t behind NAT, as it&#039;s the device doing NAT - so it can be exposed directly. I have OpenVPN listening on my WAN interface, and just have a rule to accept traffic:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>firewall.@rule[11]=rule
firewall.@rule[11].target=&#039;ACCEPT&#039;
firewall.@rule[11].src=&#039;wan&#039;
firewall.@rule[11].dest_port=&#039;11443&#039;
firewall.@rule[11].name=&#039;OpenVPN&#039;
firewall.@rule[11].proto=&#039;udp&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Your second rule works because it takes traffic from WAN destined to port 443, and redirects it to port 444 <em>on the same interface, i.e. WAN</em> - where the listening service receives it. You could probably make the first rule work, you might want to look into enabling NAT loopback, although this isn&#039;t the typical application of NAT loopback. I&#039;m not even sure this is a kind of loopback, I don&#039;t know what to call it really, besides very unusual.</p><p>Stepping back, is there a particular reason you need the service to listen <em>only</em> on the LAN interface of the router, <em>and</em> accept connections to the service from WAN? Or is this just what you <em>thought</em> you needed? I&#039;m trying to determine if it&#039;s the firewall or the service architecture that needs to be fixed.</p>									</div>

					<p>That&#039;s a fair question, but I&#039;ll say in this case my scenario is contrived a bit to simplify the results.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got a piece of software that can&#039;t be told what interface to listen on (listens on all always) running on port 443 already, so I want to pick up traffic incoming over the WAN and bump it over to 444.</p><p>The other interesting thing here is the same thing with TCP instead of UDP works in both iterations, so both of the following work flawlessly when NCat is listening on TCP instead.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>firewall.@redirect[2]=redirect

Either I don&#039;t understand something about the way UDP operates that makes it inherently different for this, in which case I&#039;d like to learn.&nbsp; The odd thing here is both methods (DNAT and REDIRECT) work in a build from last Spring, so I&#039;m leaning more to...</p><p>2. Something has changed with respect to UDP functionality in this case which worked differently last Spring (the production build I&#039;ve been running dates to then).&nbsp; Note I said changed, not necessarily broken, but I&#039;m trying to understand what changed and ultimately whether it is correct.</p><p>So I&#039;ll say definitely not trying to defend the service architecture (agree with you there is a better way to do it, and I&#039;m working on improving the software in question to make that possible), but I would really like to understand why what&#039;s happening is happening.&nbsp; Appreciate the response and the guidance thus far.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, just to say I&#039;m having the same problem where UDP port-forwards to the router&#039;s LAN interface fail to work on OpenWrt 15.05 and OpenWrt 15.05.1 but TCP port-forwards are fine. This bug report talks about the issue: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/18057">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/18057</a></p><p>Apparently the change in the firewall3 package that broke this functionality has been reverted but the fix happened after the 15.05.x CC release.</p>									</div>
