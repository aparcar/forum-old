					<p>I sucessfully built and booted OpenWRT, but I get this: &quot;turn off boot console early0&quot; followed by absolutely nothing. Is there a way to disable this so I can keep interacting with the system?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>shawnjgoff</strong> on 3 Oct 2010, 15:47)</p>

					<p>I found some more info here: <a href="http://old.nabble.com/9000-785-C8000---turn-off-boot-console-ttyB0-td27971797.html">http://old.nabble.com/9000-785-C8000--- … 71797.html</a><br />But I don&#039;t think I have the same problem. A few messages in, he figures it&#039;s because his serial terminal isn&#039;t recognized because he doesn&#039;t get a message like &quot;serial8250: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A&quot;. I do get that kind of message: &quot;serial8250: ttyS0 at MMIO 0x10000500 (irq = 13) is a 16550A&quot;. Someone else in the thread said you have to specify the console in the IPL. From what I can tell, the IPL is a boot loader for a specific HP machine. If that&#039;s the case, I&#039;m already doing that; I&#039;m specifying console=ttyS0,115200 in u-boot&#039;s bootargs environment variable.</p><p>I also found what is doing it: <a href="http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Kernel/2007-08/msg08564.html">http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-List … 08564.html</a> . It&#039;s printk, but I don&#039;t know how to &quot;replace&quot; the boot console the way it wants me to. In my boot messages I have:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>bootconsole [early0] enabled
...
console [ttyS0] enabled
...
turn off boot console early0</code></pre></div><p>This sure looks to me like the console gets setup properly. Any ideas?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>shawnjgoff</strong> on 4 Oct 2010, 18:23)</p>

					<p>Turns out the u-boot on this device was setting more arguments than just the bootargs. It was also sending a conflicting console argument at a different speed. It didn&#039;t like the two different arguments and that&#039;s why it wasn&#039;t using them. I cleared out the bootargs and to really fix it, I&#039;ll eventually reflash the bootloader to a normal version instead of the custom thing that&#039;s on there.</p>									</div>
