					<p>Hi all,</p><p>Sorry for my noob question, and I&#039;m sure that it has already been answered here (maybe many times), but as I&#039;ve got no clue what it&#039;s called I have no clue what to search for.</p><p>I&#039;ve got a TP-Link TL-WR1043ND (v1.10) here with LuCI Trunk (0.12+svn-r10530) OpenWrt Barrier Breaker 14.07 running on it nicely.<br />The WAN port of the WR1043ND is connected to an Alfa R36 in combination of an Alfa Tube U.</p><p>This setup is in a small boat, and when in a harbor I login on the WR1043ND&#039;s WiFi, and login on the R36&#039;s web interface to establish a WiFI connection with the harbor&#039;s WiFi. (I&#039;ve disabled the R36&#039;s WiFi AP to make things easer).</p><p>This is all working fine, but as this setup if on a boat I would like to keep the power consumption as low as possible.</p><p>Now my question.</p><p>Is it possible to eliminate the R36 (and Alfa Tube U) all together, and let the WR1043ND act as WiFi AP and Client(?) at the same time?</p><p>So basically make a WiFi connection with the WR1043ND to another internet AP, and at the same time get clients to connect by WiFi to the WR1043ND.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried, but as soon as I do a Scan &gt; Join Network and Submit the &quot;OpenWrt&quot; AP stops transmitting.<br />Internet does work when connected by a LAN cable to the WR1043ND.</p><p>I hope all is clear, and thank you for any info on this.</p><p>Noel</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>N0EL</strong> on 25 Sep 2015, 21:24)</p>

					<p>I see.. So that is what&#039;s going on here :(</p><p>I guess that I now need to look for a router with two radios in it.<br />Will a TP-Link TL-WDR4300 do?

					<p>In case you need the 3G Stick and the second wifi at the same time, a dual band router may be a better solution.<br />But there is yet another way: get a USB-WLAN that works with OpenWRT. In case you need directional radio this may be a problem, since many cheap USB-WLAN sticks cannot be configured to use lower output power settings. (E.g. rtl8188 based 2.4GHz USB-sticks with detachable antennas tend to deliver constant 16dB, diminished by approx 1dB for the connector and increased by 3-5 dB antenna gain. = 19-20dB EIRP.). Such a device could not be used for the following setup without violating regulatory rules of the harbour&#039;s national laws.<br />If the stick can regulate it&#039;s sending power, there are dishes on the market, that allow you to plug the stick itself in as the dish&#039;s feed.<br />That way you can use either the usb-wlan as wan (in ap station mode) or the 3G Stick as a USB-WWAN, but not a the same time.<br />The internal radio of the router will serve the clients on board of your vessel.<br />This may consume about 18 Watt or lower, that the TL-WR1043NDv1 power supply is delivering, while giving a maximum of performance with minimum of means. You could also use a TL-WR842ND, but that model isn&#039;t produced any no longer. It doesn&#039;t use Gigabit ports and is therefore equipped only with a 12 Watt power supply.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>epek</strong> on 26 Sep 2015, 20:44)</p>

					<p>Hi epek,</p><p>The USB on the router is needed for the 3G stick, and I do not see any other way of getting 3G to work. (or it needs to be some kind of 3G lan device)</p><p>I&#039;m also not in need for a &quot;long range&quot; WiFI connection. The WiFi is only needed when at port.<br />So no dish / directional antennas are needed :)</p><p>I&#039;m at the moment looking at a &quot;&#039;Gl.iNet 6416A&quot;.<br />Is has unfortunately still one radio, but the power consumption is so low,&nbsp; and for the &quot;2nd&quot; WiFi part the Alfa R36.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>N0EL</strong> on 26 Sep 2015, 22:37)</p>
