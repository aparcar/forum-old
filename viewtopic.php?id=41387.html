					<p>Hi... Trying to find a router that would fit my needs but there are quite a few so thought i post a question..</p><p>Requirements:<br />- &quot;Powerful&quot; CPU (something like the AR9344 with the 74k MIPS core). Could also be a possibility with a less powerful cpu but with HW support for blowfish. (DSP implementation or something?)<br />- Detachable antennas.<br />- 64Mb of ram, the more the better <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />- 8Mb flash is ok, but would be nice with 16Mb or more.<br />- 2.4/5Ghz dualband.<br />- TX-Power, would be good to support atleast 25dBm on 2.4 and 30dBm for 5Ghz.. Would like a minimum of 23/27dBm.</p><p>Thinking about TL-WDR4300 but it still has some way to go and would be nice to be able to pick something off the shelf that is already working.. Also waiting for a reply if the tx-power limit is on all devices after version 1.1.</p><p>Hope someone is feeling helpful today <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

I have been looking at some different arm dev-boards but have not been able to find any that can actually support the needed functionality in pure HW. (Ie still the need for an embedded DSP to do the work)<br />Next issue would be if using USB for network-adaptors the cpu-load would jump up, and this will cause additinal issues.<br />Also, if going the route of adapting something like this there would require some major work into getting everything working as wanted. </p><p>I&#039;m up for some development myself but i would like to either have a ready to go HW platform to start with or a ready SW stack to put on a custom HW platform (probably x86 with miniPCI wifi cards)..... And my preference is a ready to go HW platform like a router due to power-usage and physical size.</p><p>If anyone of you out there knows of some ARM/MIPS based boards with atleast 2 Ethernet ports and either built in WiFi cards (2.4/5Ghz) or 2 free mini-PCI(e) slots and a FPGA capable of fitting AES/Blowfish etc algo&#039;s on i would love to hear about it..</p>									</div>
