					<p>The version I want to compile for is backfire x86 10.03 final<br /> have downloaded the x86 SDK for that version, but reading the docs i am unsure as to how i set up the Alsa drivers for compilation; (I need the snd-via82xx driver)</p><p>Has anyone compiled any of the Alsa drivers, and can say how they did it? (e.g. do I download into the SDK packages folder, or just point a Makefile url somewhere? docs seem to imply both are options)</p><p>TIA</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>donquixote2u</strong> on 23 Mar 2012, 04:25)</p>
