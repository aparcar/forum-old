					<p>What would be the right forum?&nbsp; </p><p>This is general discussion, the rest of the subforums certainly aren&#039;t the correct place.</p><p>I would be helpful, but I have the same problem.&nbsp; In theory, you go into /etc/config/network and change vlan1 from &quot;0 5&quot; to &quot;4 5&quot;.<br />Then you go into /etc/config/wireless and comment out the line that disables the wireless (there is a comment right there, it is obvious).</p><p>That will give you wireless, however, then your ethernet connections and your wireless connections won&#039;t be bridged, which is what I don&#039;t know how to do.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not sure why iwconfig isn&#039;t available to you, I think it should be there but intially will show no wireless support on any of the interfaces...</p><p>Next you have to remove the&nbsp; &quot;option disabled 1&quot; lines under your respective wifi interfaces in /etc/config/wireless, have you already done that?</p>									</div>
