					<p>Hey all,</p><p>I have been playing with an old Netgear WNR2000v2 and I think I have kinda bricked it. It was running dd-wrt but mainly acting just as a Wireless AP, however, I wanted to try out a site-tp-site VPN using IPSec which dd-wrt doesn&#039;t support, so thought the OpenWRT might be a solution. </p><p>The WNR2000 comes in several versions and the ones listed are mainly the Atheros CPU, however, the v2 use the Broadcom BCM4716. As there seemed to be nothing specifically available, in the first instance I tried the &quot;<a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/brcm47xx/openwrt-brcm47xx-generic-squashfs.trx">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … uashfs.trx</a>&quot; image, which I flashed direct from the dd-wrt install. Whilst this booted, it seemed to put itself into a fail safe more - I could see packets being broadcast to port 4919. I tried to run some cleanup, but the router always booted into failsafe.</p><p>The next attempt was to run a copy a new image to the /tmp directory (this time the &quot;<a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09-rc2/brcm47xx/generic/openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx">http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_a … uashfs.trx</a>&quot; image)and run a sysupgrade, however, this is where things when awry. The upgrade seem to proceed OK (up until the &quot;Writing from &lt;stdin&gt; to firmware ... &quot;) but then things&nbsp; froze and I lost connection with the device. After a while, I had to reboot and now the device only partially comes up but looses its IP (192.168.1.1) very quickly. In addition, I can see TFPT requests being sent to 192.168.1.2 for the file &quot;vmlinuz&quot;. After approximately 4/5 requests, the device then drops of the network.</p><p>Is there anything else I can do from here on in? Help very much appreciated.</p><p>Many thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, you can get a copy of the vmlinuz kernel and put it on a TFTP server on 192.168.1.2</p>									</div>

However it should accept gzipped vmlinux that you can find at:<br />build_dir/*/linux-brcm47xx*/vmlinux.gz<br />(you need to compile OpenWrt by yourself to get this file).</p><p>So take this vmlinux.gz, put it in TFTP server directory and rename to vmlinuz.<br />You&#039;ll have to try this vmlinuz trick.

					<p>Cheers guys.</p><p>I hadn&#039;t quite banked on compiling the OpenWRT but its my own stupid fault. Little fingers will mess. Still I now need to get a suitable Linux VM system up and running order to get this sorted.

					<p>Oh dear. Just check the router and it behaving differently. Now. The light still come on but now I&#039; not seeing any TFTP request from the router and no network response at all when I start it up. Bugger.</p><p>I guess a serial connection is the only way forward now?</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m getting some odd result. I didn&#039;t get around to compiling the OpenDRT source so I didn&#039;t TFTP anything across. However, I&#039;m now seeing a very, very, VERY occasional response from the router if I run an extended ping (maximum of 3 ICMP replies), but this is not easily repeatable. The router is no longer sending TFTP requests at all.</p><p>The Router hardware lights are behaving relatively normally - i.e. After the traffic lights during start-up, if you plug into an Ethernet port on the LAN side, the port light will come up, as will the WAN port. The power light is constant amber, however, every so often the router will randomly reboot.</p><p>I am reading that with SOME kind of response from the router and with the TTL set to 100 (which it is), this is a sign that the CPE is functional????</p>									</div>

					<p>Early ping response are most likely coming from the CFE. Port lights are expected to &quot;response&quot; for cable connection even without firmware (OpenWrt) working. This handled on the hardware level, it is *not* OpenWrt controlling them.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t know how you guys bricked your routers, but I bricked my router in two different ways.</p><p>The first time, I tried flashing <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05/brcm47xx/mips74k/openwrt-15.05-brcm47xx-mips74k-netgear-wnr2000v2-squashfs.chk">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal … uashfs.chk</a> to the router. You&#039;d think that a file with &quot;netgear-wnr2000v2&quot; in the name would actually work on a Netgear WNR2000v2, but nope, bricked. When I turned on the router, after a few seconds the power LED would continually blink green. This time, I simply tftp&#039;d the firmware to the router using <a href="http://cyberstorm.altervista.org/wag354g/guides/howto_unbricking_wag354g_en.txt">this guide</a>. Easy.</p><br /><p>Now, the second time, this is where things got harder. I accidentally uploaded a DD-WRT image larger than the maximum firmware size (I can&#039;t seem to find this number now, but it&#039;s something like 34XXXXX bytes), meaning that I had just overwritten a settings partition at the end of the flash chip. Oops. Now, however, after a few seconds the power LED would stay orange. While if I pinged the router, I would get 2-4 ping responses briefly (TTL=100), I simply could not get the TFTP to work.</p><p>So, I went to Google, and found <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=81013">this topic</a>. Although I had to do what the second post in the topic said (plug the router in, THEN short the pins), it worked perfectly. One tftp later, and I now had one successfully unbricked router!</p><p>I hope this helps someone.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Hitechcomputergeek</strong> on 13 Jan 2016, 07:11)</p>

					<p>Mine bricked also but it was an extremely easy fix... I&#039;m on a windows machine so I just used tftp2.exe to flash the factory firmware. Just type 192.168.1.1 on the &quot;Server&quot; field, leave &quot;Password&quot; blank then browse for the firmware file and hit &quot;Upgrade&quot; it took only 20 seconds. Router is back to life but I still want to install openwrt. Any news on this issue?</p>									</div>
