					<p>I am really new developing for OpenWrt and was looking for it for a long time.<br />Sorry for my bad English, I am from Brazil.</p><p>I am using Lua and Luci to develop a OpenWrt interface.</p><p>I want to check if the router has internet connectivity. It could be making a HTTP GET request to my server or getting the IP address or in a simplest way.<br />I would appreciate not having to install external APIs. There is a way to do that?</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p><p>Melanke</p>									</div>
