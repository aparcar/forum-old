					<p>Dear all,</p><p>I am quite new to OpenWrt (used DD-Wrt a lot during the last couple of years, but finally want to get rid of it) and am very impressed of the project.</p><p>At the moment I am trying to set up a IPsec Road Warrior Configuration. Basically I would like to configure OpenWrt in a way, that I can log in to my private network from outside my LAN via IPsec and my iPhone.</p><p>What I did was:<br/>- Following Wiki IPsec Basics<br/>- Following Wiki IPsec Firewall<br/>- Following Wiki IPsec Road Warrior Configuration<br/>- And trying Wiki IPsec With Certificates<br/>- Gooooooooooogle * 1000000000<br/>- OpenWrt Forum Search<br/>- :-(</p><p>I am now struggling with it for three days and am about to give up :-(&nbsp; &nbsp;I really hope someone can help. Hardware is TP-Link TL-WDR4300, Build is openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wdr4300-v1-squashfs-sysupgrade_attitude-adjustment_12-09-beta.</p><p>First of all the Wiki articles seem to be buggy (?) or not adaptet for Attitute Adjustment:<br/>- The &quot;ps&quot; command has no &quot;-ef&quot; switch on my busybox, so I simply removed &quot;-ef&quot; from /etc/init.d/racoon<br/>- There was also a problem with &quot;blowfish&quot; encryption. This is statet anywhere (sorry, can&#039;t remember where), but my Kernel was not able to run that. So I simply removed that option. Finally racoon started without any problems (just startet, but no connection possible)<br/>- Then I followed the Firewall article but that broke my network connection. It says that you don&#039;t need to set up any Zone forwardings, but without you can&#039;t reach anything. Firewall does not seem to be an issue now, I can see that my iPhone is able to connect from outside. Possible, that my Firewall configuration is totally insecure atm, but since I&#039;m just testing internally that is no real concern up to now (would like to get IPsec working first before thinking about that).</p><p>Then I tried to configure racoon (for almost 3 days) but didn&#039;t get my iPhone connecting to it, tried almost everything :-(<br/>- When setting &quot;exchange_mode&quot; to &quot;aggressive&quot; I almost always get &quot;ERROR: exchange Identity Protection not allowed in any applicable rmconf.&quot;<br/>- When setting &quot;exchange_mode&quot; to &quot;main&quot; it seems to work better, but connection fails with &quot;ERROR: mode config 6 from 192.168.1.109[500], but we have no ISAKMP-SA.&quot;<br/>- Then I also played around with IPsec Certificates, this failed with &quot;unknown certtype&quot;.<br/>- Toggled almost every flag I found for racoon, no success</p><p>I could cry :-(</p><p>Please, I would be thankfull for any advice!!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hmm, noone with an idea? :-(</p><p>Struggled with it again today without success. Since I do not seem to be able to get racoon running properly I today tried strongswan. Read a few things about it and some articles mentioned that it is easier to configure and capable of serving for the iPhone.</p><p>What i did (again on Attitute Adjustment Beta):<br/>- opkg install strongswan<br/>- /etc/init.d/strongswan ==&gt; does not exist<br/>- /etc/inti.d/ipsec ==&gt; does not exist</p><p>Anyway there is an article here in the forum, 2 users had the same problem of a non-existant init script. A brief reply of another user was to look at the strongswan readme (actually there is nothing about that in the readme as far as I have seen it). Searched a lot and found that it seems that the strongswan team decided not to include init scripts anymore. Bump.<br/>Well, what is even worst, there does not seem to be a binary file for strongswan when i install it with opkg, so even with an init script nothing would run. That is the output of &quot;opkg files strongswan&quot;:<br/>Package strongswan (5.0.0-1) is installed on root and has the following files:<br/>/usr/lib/ipsec/libhydra.so.0<br/>/usr/lib/ipsec/libstrongswan.so.0<br/>/usr/lib/ipsec/libstrongswan.so.0.0.0<br/>/etc/ipsec.secrets<br/>/etc/strongswan.conf<br/>/usr/lib/ipsec/libhydra.so.0.0.0<br/>/lib/upgrade/keep.d/strongswan</p><p>So how can I run it!? Tried to search the binary manually, did not find anything :-(</p><p>PLEASE, any advice (ether on racoon = most prefered, or strongswan) would be GREAT!</p><p>Will google around another few hours and then propably try openswan. Up to now IPsec + Road Warrior Setup + iPhone seems to be a no-go on OpenWrt ..... or I seem to be to stupid for OpenWrt <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile"/></p>									</div>

					<p>Regarding strongswan installation: Yes, I have been to stupid :-)</p><p>Just in case anyone else ever struggles with it:<br/>- You should not install &quot;strongswan&quot; but &quot;strongswan-default&quot;, so &quot;opkg update &amp;&amp; opkg install strongswan-default&quot;<br/>- When installing it complained about &quot;check_data_file_clashes: Package strongswan-utils wants to install file /usr/lib/ipsec/_copyright&quot;&nbsp; &quot;But that file is already provided by package&nbsp; * strongswan-mod-stroke&quot;<br/>- I simply deleted /usr/lib/ipsec/_copyright and re-run &quot;opkg install strongswan-default&quot;</p><p>There is still no init script in /etc/init.d but the deamon seems to be existing. Thats a huge progress.</p><p>Does anyone of you have prepared init script for it!?</p>									</div>

					<p>I think I found the solution. Besides opening UDP ports 500 and 4500 you have to add the following iptables rule:<br/>iptables -A input_wan -m policy --strict --dir in --pol ipsec --proto esp -j ACCEPT</p><p>It&#039;s now working in my case!!! Hurray!!! The only worrying thing is that I have no real clue what this rule means, have to search a bit to sleep well with my firwall setting. </p><p>Would anyone be so nice and explain the rule?</p><p>@rossini: Also working for you?</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I now also wrote an init-script and it seems to work .... well, also thought that several times before <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink"/></p><p>I followed this GREAT description, especially to generate valid certificates for iOS:<br/><a href="http://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/IOS_(Apple)">strongSwan iOS (Apple iPhone, iPad...) and Mac OS X</a></p><p>Here are all my config files. Basically the OpenWrt router&#039;s IP is 192.168.1.1, it serves as DHCP server for 192.168.1.0/24. I also configured strongswan in a way that it requests IP adresses from the DHCP, so probably you have to install package strongswan-mod-dhcp (I think that was the name of it).</p><p>ipsec.conf&nbsp; .... I assume that these plutostart and nat_traversal settings are useless, but who knows:<br/></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># ipsec.conf - strongSwan IPsec configuration file

					<p>Sorry, can&#039;t really help. Just tell me if you need anything else. Maybe there is something wrong in your routing table?? (just a guess) </p><p>As far as I struggled with it I found that this rightsubnet setting in ipsec.conf is quite crucial. Then I also had to add forceencaps=yes in ipsec.conf, otherwise it seemed that iptables (the kernel??, the ipsec daemon??) did not mask/mark the ipsec packages correctly. Afterwards it just worked.</p><p>My project for the weekend is to reset the router again and to config everything from scratch again ... not just test-settings, but the stable-seetings of it ... i.e. no more &quot;thisisotto&quot; as password <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink"/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Up to now I also did not activate wlan. Hopefully it will also work after resetting everything. I&#039;ll definetly report.</p>									</div>

					<p>Back again. Regarding the [NNL] NAT mappings of ESP ...&nbsp; in which logfile do you get that one?</p><p>Today I set up StrongSwan in my productive environment. Despite everything working in my testing environment I can only reach my Gateway and nothing else in LAN (same situation like rossini). Seems that the search starts from the beginning again.</p><p>@rossini: Did you have any luck in the meantime?</p><p>Edit:<br/>Funny. Can reach my gateway on 172.16.0.1, AND my Switch web interface on 172.16.0.2 but nothing else.
