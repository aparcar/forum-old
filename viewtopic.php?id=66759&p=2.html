					<p>dizturbedxmind,</p><p>the only option that is changed from the defaults for releases is selecting luci, the web interface. No other changes are made. If you installed additional packages through the web interface you may want to select those as well. Don&#039;t worry, it will probably take a couple rounds of trial and error anyway to get the feel how things fit together.</p><p>If you build from up to date sources you always get the latest which OpenWrt offers. Sometimes there is a more recent driver upstream, in which case you can just change the version number in the Makefile but that&#039;s for another time and isn&#039;t needed here.</p><p>PS: Well, your ipv4 setup doesn&#039;t seem to work properly either <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />&nbsp; Resolves to 212.47.226.249 for me.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sera</strong> on 4 Jan 2017, 11:39)</p>

					<p>seur18,</p><p>Ideally you&#039;d just grab the SDK and run &quot;./scripts/feeds update &amp;&amp; make defconfig &amp;&amp; make&quot;, though that doesn&#039;t work as compat-wireless can&#039;t be built in this context as-is.

					<p>sera, <br />thanks for your help, and yes I know I was one that usually install the Nemoalex ipk , for this reason then I tried to it myselft but without luck.</p><p>dizturbedxmind, <br />the process to build only the mwlwifi driver it&#039;s what sera and me are talking about. It&#039;s not easy to build the driver for an old kernel version because you must to change the source code to make it compatible. Maybe the softbrick that you said is like when I installed the kaloz image in my WRT1900ACSv2. In my case the issue was that the switch has a bug, the port 6 disappear, for this reason if you have set up a vlan on the lan side you cannot reach the router until you reset it</p>									</div>

					<p>seur18,</p><p>This time I used the SDK as intended or so I thought, the first time was clearly an abuse. Guess will have to setup a test environment myself, will see where to fit it in. The backport is available as a patch so if someone else wants to try, be my guest, you might well beat me to the punch.</p><p>If you could test if the swconfig / vlan patch fixes your issue it could be upstream as a bug fix, currently it&#039;s closer to a feature change which wouldn&#039;t belong into the stable branch.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi seur18,</p><p>There is no prebuilt image for the switch patch, the patch is meant to be applied ontop of CC and then used to build an image yourself.</p><p>As for your worries, get yourself an usb2ttl cable and try to understand the recovery methods listed on the wiki. Basically if you know how to recover from a completely trashed flash there is no need to worry ever again. Not that it would be easy to trash it in the first place.</p>									</div>

					<p>@sera, sorry for the delayed response - work has been hectic. I finally took the time to sit down and build the image, and got it uploaded - yet i&#039;m still having the same difficulties. I&#039;ve spoken with some colleagues and I&#039;ve decided I&#039;m throwing in the towel on this setup. Just ordered a Ubiquiti access point lol</p>									</div>

					<p>dizturbedxmind,</p><p>As long as I can&#039;t reproduce it&#039;s hard to try figuring out what exactly goes wrong. Ubiquiti access point might indeed be the least painful solution.</p><p>Anyway mind posting your switch configuration so I can have another look at it?</p>									</div>
