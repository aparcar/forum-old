					<p>Hi!</p><p>I&#039;ve configured openwrt box to forward necessary ports to VPN server - 500, 4500 and 1701 udp. Also, I permit ah and esp traffic. However, VPN connection from internet cannot be established to the server. Phase 1 processed, Phase 2 cannot be established. It seems, like something messing in IPSec passthrough setup. <br />My openwrt box has static external IP. VPN server - static internal. In VPN server logs I can see, that all connections from Internet to VPN server seems like from my internal OpenWRT IP to my internal VPN server IP - ex from 10.0.0.1[4500] &lt;-&gt; 10.0.0.254[6778]</p><br /><p>Maybe, that&#039;s the reason?</p>									</div>
