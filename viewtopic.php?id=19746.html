					<p>What&#039;s the basic difference? To be more precise, can someone explain why we need both? I gathered that OpenWrt packages can be installed with ipkg and NSLU2 packages with ipkg-opt, ipkg-opt itself can be installed with ipkg, and they use different install roots. But to me it seems that they are basically the same ipkg, they both handle the same .ipk file format and package lists, and that confuses me. Isn&#039;t there a common, generic solution to access the two aforementioned and every other existing package repository with only one application and install them to, for example, only /opt, and not two different places?</p>									</div>
