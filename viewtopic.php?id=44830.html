					<p>Hi,</p><p>I try to use on my openWRT box the DHCP/DNS server from my clearos server, because I need the DNS capabilities of this server (there are DNS configs for my webserver etc.). Actually, this works fine, if I mask an external server (like a google server) with another name. But the local mask do not work - e.g. my webserver should be available with the name wpad -&gt; that is needed, so the browser can auto-detect the proxy.</p><p>But the webserver and the wifi are on a different subnet, because openWRT lan uses its own dhcp server (webserver/clearos: 192.168.0.0/24, openWRT-LAN: 192.168.1.0/24)&nbsp; When I disable the dhcp function on the lan, I have no dhcp at all on the openWRT box.</p><p>Is it possible to configure an external dhcp server and where can I do that?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Moe</p><p>PS: I already created a topic on the clearos forum, because I thought that might be a clearos problem, but it turned out, my configuration on the openWRT box is wrong. Anyway, here is the thread from the other forum: <a href="http://www.clearfoundation.com/component/option,com_kunena/Itemid,232/catid,28/func,view/id,53688/#53690">http://www.clearfoundation.com/componen â€¦ 688/#53690</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, I solved it.</p><p>I found a tutorial for what I was trying to accomplish: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/bridgedap">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/bridgedap</a></p><p>Because I have to wifi routers (that are both in switch mode) I also activated the Spanning Tree Protocol. The main problem was an IP filter I setted up on another switch.</p><p>Now, both routers are served by my DHCP server from the clearOS box, with the DNS server right up.</p>									</div>
