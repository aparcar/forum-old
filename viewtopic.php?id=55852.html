					<p>Hi,<br />I&#039;m attempting to get USB/IP installed on an ASUS WL320GE but am running into trouble. I&#039;ve done the first login and am now onto the PuTTY stage. When I attempt &quot;opkg update&quot; it returns the above error. From looking at other topics it seems this is due to conflicting IP addresses, or lack of a DNS address. I&#039;ve tried &quot;ping 8.8.8.8&quot; from within PuTTY and it returns:<br />ping: sendto: Network is unreachable<br />Now there do seem to be other people with similar troubles, for example this topic:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=35702">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=35702</a></p><p>I&#039;m not sure how to change the IP address or DNS address through PuTTY. Should I be doing so through the Windows Control Panel? I (think I) did change it on the control panel before but then everything seemed to go wrong and I couldn&#039;t connect so I reflashed and started again.<br />Thanks</p>									</div>
