					<p>Buy a <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wbmr-hp-g300h">WBMR-HP-G300H</a>.</p><p>It suits your needs, it&#039;s well supported, it has a lot of flash (32MB), 64MB of RAM, 4 Gigabit Ethernet Ports and a USB 2.0 port.</p><p>IMHO all the above makes it the best choice when it comes to a modem-router device that is supported by the OpenWrt project.</p>									</div>

					<p>I would, reluctantly, advise against the W8970. It works fine, but it is severely limited: Only one radio (albeit switchable to 5 GHz), CPU and RAM are not on the spectacular side of things. Also, in current release versions (CC) the kernel throws a lot of errors when WAN is saturated at about 50 mbit/s. In this case, SQM helps ... but pushes the CPU towards 100%. Additionally, the whole machine runs quite hot. All of that lead me to decide against this machine in an environment where I would want at least some baseline of reliability.</p><p>Instead I would recommend not going for an all-in-one solution and getting an external {A|V}DSL modem and a more capable router with multiple radios and an at least a little more powerful CPU.</p>									</div>
