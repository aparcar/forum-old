					<p>Hi,</p><p>Has this been checked for inclusion in openwrt ?</p><br /><p>As seen on sveasoft forum :<br />ASUS released a source tarball with a new wireless driver and enough source code so that we can support up to 16 virtual wireless interfaces on a single router. </p><p>It appears that you can actually mix and match client and AP modes, with some virtual wireless interfaces running in client mode and some running in AP mode. This is a bit of a routing nightmare but I think I&#039;ve got the web interface down to a point and click level so even beginners can do this. </p><p>There also appears to be the ability to run different levels of encryption (or none) on each virtual interface. </p><p>What this means is that the routers we support (wrt54G/GS) now have one of the most important Enterprise class features usually only found in very expensive gear. </p><p>For example, you will be able to run an open SSID with limited access, a closed SSID with WPA or WPA2, and a hotspot SSID, all at the same time. Our new QoS &amp; Firewall supports multiple interfaces simultaneously as well so you can have different rulesets for each virtual wireless interface and SSID with different firewall and bandwidth management values for each. </p><p>Look for these goodies in a new ???</p>									</div>

					<p>We have known about this for quite some time now. And as you can in this trac ticket: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/16">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/16</a>, we&#039;ve already integrated the new driver and done some work on integrating its new features.</p>									</div>
