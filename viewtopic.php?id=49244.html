					<p>Trying to backup the firmware before getting into more dangerous procedures.<br />Unfortunately, that device only offers a very restricted BusyBox and I don&#039;t know how to deal with it effectively.<br />I can&#039;t &quot;dd&quot; for example, and using &quot;cat&quot; to see file content always gives me the complete file....no &quot;less&quot; or &quot;more&quot; possible.<br />Tried to redirect the &quot;cat filename&quot; into a file /tmp/test.bin and it looks ok, but how do I get this file off the router?<br />This thing doesn&#039;t even have a ssh-server available, it seems - all I can do is manually start a telnetd. Could I try &quot;wget&quot; if the BusyBox on the router can&#039;t operate that command? I guess no.</p><p>So what else could I try?</p>									</div>
