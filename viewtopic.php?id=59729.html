Or something to that effect. I would have to defer this to another more knowledgeable person. To be perfectly honest, I never actually tried doing it within the UCI system since those four lines effectively take care of forwarding between everything and all the tun interfaces, of which my OpenWrt box is currently running three.</p>									</div>

					<p>@RangerZ @metai Thank you both for your help. I&#039;ve added the proposed config to firewall.user but still no connection to my devices in lan sub net.

Port forwarding from gateway to wifi router is definitly working. </p><p>Here is the client config to eliminate it as source of error:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>client

Absolutly no idea why there are two tun devices. <br />If its not working this way I will go back to the most basic config and proceed from there on.

If OpenVPN is not running on your gateway, the machines in your network receive a request, try to answer it, since they don&#039;t know any better their reply is of course routed to their gateway ... which doesn&#039;t know what to do with it either and probably sends it out its WAN where it (more or less) quickly gets discarded.</p><p>In such a setup, you need to set a static route on your gateway router that points the IP range you offer to the OpenVPN clients towards the machine the OpenVPN server runs on. In your case, this means a static route for 10.1.1.0/24 going to the IP of your OpenVPN server host&#039;s IP.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 19 Sep 2015, 20:39)</p>
