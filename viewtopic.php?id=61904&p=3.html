But in a controlled environment.&nbsp; Different user environments (clients, isp&#039;s, physical location etc) gives different outcomes in performance - and the image you provided me with has so far turned out to be great for my router. I have seen more complaints than positive stories about this router and the WRT1900AC. Maybe the people who get a good &quot;out of the box&quot; experience don&#039;t tend to write about it - and it&#039;s just us few? with problems who do some research and make posts about our experiences? I hope batch differences are not the main cause of issue(s) with this router - and I think the best approach to solve the issues are comparing settings and environments to reduce the number of unknowns to be able to reproduce and reduce problems.<br />I mean - my stock image worked like shit, which could indicate I got a router from a bad batch. But your image worked great, meaning there is hope for the people still experiencing problems.<br />I&#039;m lucky I stumbled upon this topic and saw your post, and I really appreciate the info and help you guys have provided. I would be happy to share anything I&#039;ve done (if anything) if it can help other OpenWrt noobs like myself <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi davidc502, I am a total openwrt noob but I flashed my cobra with your image and it seems to work great so far (had previously some issues with dd-wrt and the other open wrt image I flashed from arokh didn&#039;t work, my devices would not connect to the network for some unknown reasons). <br />My question is the following, do you have samba and dlna enabled on your image?

					<p>Hey there everyone,</p><p>im just following this thread vigilant, since i&#039;m rather unhappy with the performance of the router. Just bought i yesterday and tried first with the stock-firmware. On the first tries on speedtest.net it was very promising, since i got the my full isp speed at 120mbit, but after an hour or two it was around 50-60Mbit.</p><p>Thankfully, i thought, there is still openwrt around (had it on my old TP-Link 1043nd already installed, which i wanted to replace) and i installed the last snapshot. But unfortunately the same game. At the beginning at works as intended, but after a while the speed just drops to around 50Mbit.</p><p>I almost resigned to my fate, but today i have a new problem that the router responds very slow to new connections (e.g. browsing the a new website). You can see that on a speedtest as well, initial ping at around 200 (usually 20). (tried the old 1043nd, no problems here - same channel, same channel bandwith, same openwrt snapshot)</p><p>So you guys think those problems will be fixed in the near future? otherwise i&#039;ll send it back since 240Euro for this pice of crap is way too much.</p><p>@davidc502: i currently have your build installed. but i have a problem installing kmod-fs-ntfs.
