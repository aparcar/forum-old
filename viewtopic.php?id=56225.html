					<p>HI there<br />I have TPLink WR4300ND and BarrierBreaker installed. I want to have VPN server installed on it. But I was a little confused with all of this racoon, openswan, pptpd etc. So I need some consultation to choose.<br />I want to connect with native client on WIn7, Win8, Android, iPhone, MacOS so I think OpenVPN doesn&#039;t suite. My best priority is speed, security is second priority.<br />So what technology you can advise me? LInks to How-To&#039;s highly appreciated<br />Thanks in advance</p>									</div>

					<p>I have set up a VPN server for Android and iOS devices (did not try with Windows or MacOS machines). OpenVPN was not supported on my old (2.3) Android devices, and PPTP is frequently deemed as insecure; so I finally opted for L2TP. I am currently using openswan / ipsecd with xl2tpd, and it works pretty well.</p><p>I had to use several HOWTOs, guides, blog posts, forum messages, .... to make it work, and I have not bookmarked most of them; but I can provide my configuration files, if you need them.</p>									</div>

					<p>In fact I&#039;ve already tried to install L2TP based on openswan, I&#039;ve got some manual for it. But the first problem I&#039;ve got was:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# opkg install openswan
