					<p>Rather new to the OpenWRT forum.</p><p>Looking for information on why some modules such as ipt_imq is no longer being used in latest AR71xx .30 kernel. I see xt_imq in my modules folder. Without these older modules Nodogsplash goes crazy if I leave the /etc/init.d/nodogsplash file uncommented to do traffic shaping. I&#039;ve tried to edit nodogsplash to use xt_imq thinking that&#039;s the replacement for ipt_imq. That didn&#039;t work. I&#039;ve did numerous things like use an older ip tables makefile and even went so far as to replace the &quot;kernel&quot; package with an older one thinking that would somehow build these modules.</p><p>I then used an older OpenWRT trunk with a .28 kernel that did have the module and then told the newest trunk to use the same kernel. After it was all said and done I dropped the ipt_imq file from the older build into the newer build. That didn&#039;t go so well either. All I&#039;m trying to do is have the best of both worlds. The newest OpenWRT AR71xx files the random mac address on the RouterStation which is good, but along with that I need NodogSplash to work. I can make it work but it doesn&#039;t have traffic shaping. Maybe it&#039;s not OpenWRT that needs fixed, maybe it&#039;s NodogSplash that needs updated?</p><p>Thanks for any and all response.</p>									</div>

					<p>I might not have explained this very clear, but if anyone knows how to run Nodogsplash in the latest trunk of AR71XX with the ipt_imq module that would be of great help. I&#039;ve did a lot of research on why the ipt_imq is no longer in the modules folder and really didn&#039;t find anything.</p><p>Will any form of kernel/iptables compile in the latest trunk lead to having the needed modules like in older trunk/kernel builds?</p>									</div>
