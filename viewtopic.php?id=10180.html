					<p>Hello to the forum,<br />I&#039;m new here and I&#039;m interested to buy a device capable to run OpenWrt. Now I have a router, an ADSL modem and an access point WiFi. I want to consolidate these three devices into only one (also to reduce power consumption and waste less space). Running OpenWrt on it, with all the power of a linux system will be great. <br />I have already take a look to the TableOfHardware and I have found some D-Link products matching my specs (but the support for the WiFi is dubious...).</p><p>Anyway, anyone, here, have some product suggestion?</p><p>Thank you!</p>									</div>

					<p>My person opinion is that if your willing to have it as an &quot;all-in-two&quot; setup, you&#039;ll save yourself some serious headaches (modem, router/wifi).</p>									</div>

					<p>How would the modem work into the &quot;all-in-one&quot; solution you&#039;re talking about? afaik, you would still need this modem from your isp. I could be mistaken.</p>									</div>
