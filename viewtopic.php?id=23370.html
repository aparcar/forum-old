					<p>Hi, I just install openwrt on my ns2. I was wondering is it possible to change BSSID when the device wifi is in Access Point mode?<br />If it is possible, could you share the steps for doing that in Luci? or using command line on the router?</p><p>Thanks a lot</p>									</div>

					<p>The fact is that I can add &quot;bssid&quot; in &quot;wifi-device&quot; config in &quot;wireless&quot; file, and I can also change the Mac address for the interface in Luci. But none of this takes any effect. Although the interface status shows a change of mac address when I change it in Luci. The signal I pick up with network stumbler still shows the old mac address.</p>									</div>
