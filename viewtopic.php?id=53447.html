					<p>I have been examining the contents of the SPI flash chip on some Mikrotik RouterBOARDs, and I noticed that in the Hard and Soft configuration partitions, it has the magic draH or tfoS, then a 32-bit checksum, then a series of configuration fields.</p><p>I want to be able to modify the RouterBOOT settings in the Soft configuration partition from within OpenWRT, but I need to calculate the correct checksum so that RouterBOOT doesn&#039;t just erase it and write default values.</p><p>Does anybody happen to know what algorithm is used to calculate the checksum, and what parts it is calculated over?&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried all the combinations with CRC32, and none of them produced the value actually stored in flash at this position.</p><p>Example soft_config on RB433AH:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/# hexdump -C /dev/mtdblock3

					<p>From some googling and experimenting, it seems that the Soft configuration partiton uses the Ethernet Frame Check Sequence algorithm, and there is a utility called rbcfg that implements a way of changing the settings.&nbsp; The checksum is calculated over the entire 4K partition, with the checksum field set to 0x00000000.&nbsp; The checksum is stored in big-endian format.</p><p>I compared the hard_config partitions between two RB433AH boards and found only the software ID, MAC, and Serial Number fields changed, so there is no checksum.&nbsp; (This could be useful, if, for example, you populate more stuff on a low-end version of a board and need to change the model number passed to the kernel.)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>matthewr21</strong> on 19 Oct 2014, 04:33)</p>
