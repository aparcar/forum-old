					<p>Hello,<br />I have been trying for a while to configure OpenWrt to route only traffic on a certain WiFi network(which issues a different IP range than the LAN). I have almost got it working but am having a problem. I followed this forum post viewtopic.php?id=40760 (can&#039;t post a direct link, understandably so) to help solve the issue, as the OP is attempting to do the same as me, but it does not work. Much like he describes in the thread, on 15.05 after following the IP route script suggestions I get no internet on the WiFi network. I have included various configuration files below. I am running kaloz&#039;s build of 15.05.1 on a WRT 1900ACS. If anyone can help me solve this problem it would be greatly appreciated as I would love to get this working. <br /><strong>/etc/config/openvpn</strong><br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config openvpn &#039;pia_client&#039;

					<p>You have not posted your server config, so 50% of the puzzle is missing.</p><p>Can you explain what you&#039;re trying to do? Are you trying to access only the 10.0.0.0/24 network on the other side of the link, or are you also trying to access other networks (and even possibly the internet beyond). What IP address is your server pushing to the client? What IP address is assigned to the tun interface on the other side of the tunnel. What is your network addressing scheme on the network on the other side of the tunnel?</p><p>What is this interface &quot;guest&quot;? You&#039;re trying to assign an IP address to it that&#039;s part of what appears to be your VPN network, but guest has no associated interface name. And even if it did have an interface name that is distinct from tun1, this would certainly break routing.</p><p>Can you setup the tunnel then ping the local tun1 interface.

It also looks like he&#039;s trying to route via a commercial VPN provider and use it as the default route to the internet for the wifi clients. So the VPN provider should have the correct iptables rules in place already....</p><p>If the WIFI clients are on the network 10.0.0.0/24, the following line in the vpn-up script looks incorrect</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ip route add 10.0.0.0/24 dev $dev table vpn</code></pre></div><p>He only wants packets FROM this network to be routed via rules in the vpn table. The actual route TO this network should already be correctly defined as the local guest interface when the guest interface itself gets assigned its static 10.0.0.1 address.</p><p>However, the guest entry in /etc/config/network appears to be missing an interface name specification and/or a bridge specification. If he wants guest to be wifi clients, then he must define guest as a bridge and bind his wifi interfaces to guest in /etc/config/wireless (or if only one wifi interface, instead of a making guest a bridge just add a option _orig_ifname &#039;wlanX&#039; to the guest definition)</p><p>Furthermore, interface guest is assigned to the firewall zone guest and interface tun1 to the firewall zone VPN_FW. There is no forwarding rule between guest and VPN_FW, only between lan and VPN_FW and guest and WAN. Clearly from the up script, guest should have a forwarding rule via the vpn.</p><p>The /etc/config/firewall already has a masquerade option for zone VPN_FW, so the iptables masquerade rules in the vpn_up.sh are superfluous.</p>									</div>

Those were there mostly to problem solve since I could not figure out what I was missing(better to be redundant than miss something?). Also as far as bridging interfaces, without the VPN connected(so vpn_up.sh hasn&#039;t run) the guest network issues IPs and has internet access just fine. The second I connect the VPN, that network loses internet access but IPs are still issues fine. I will try adding the defaultroute &#039;0&#039; to my interface config and will add a forwarding rule for guest to VPN_FW and report back. Thank you.</p><p>Edit: Also of note, when I allowed pulled routes from the VPN provider(and didnt use an up script) it worked fine, it just tunneled all traffic instead of just traffic from 10.0.0.0/24.</p><p>Edit2: Interesting development. After making those changes I connected a device to the network on 10.0.0.0/24 and checked my ip/to ensure I had internet. After turning the VPN on while connected to the network, I tried checking my ip again and it was the VPN&#039;s ip. I immediately thought that had fixed it! However after disconnecting and reconnecting to the network, it stopped working again and I lost internet. I tried restarting the VPN again and the same thing happened. I had internet. Sort of. Google would load and show me the VPN IP but any other domain would not work. I thought maybe it was a DNS issue, but when I tried manually resolving reddit for example I got the error fastly error: unkinown domain: 151.101.129.140</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Q_Q</strong> on 17 Nov 2016, 01:16)</p>
