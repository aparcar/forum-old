					<p>I was looking for a small WNDR3700 build to suit my needs that had a full suite of routing features but none of the extra fluff that seems to always come packaged in most generic images. Lucky for me, hnyman provided a <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=28392">great build</a> for me to start from, but it still wasn&#039;t 100% of what I wanted.</p><p>I only do &quot;router things&quot; with my router. It is not a media or file server. It does, however, make for an excellent proxy server since it is already the single point of entry to my home network.<br />This build is mostly packaged as hnyman provides his, and what I based it from. I believe I may have only removed the FTPD then further added some additional iptables/kmod packages, squid, and mkfs tools. LuCI reports 1.39MB of free space for any additional tweaks/packages you feel like applying post-install.</p><p>I am currently running this on my router letting it serve as a transparent squid proxy with the cache residing on a mounted USB stick. All of hnyman&#039;s patches have been applied to this. Please see <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=28392">his thread</a> if you&#039;d like more info on that.</p><p>I hope some other people find this work useful and that it saves you some time. My goal is to provide a solid base that has a robust enough feature set to fully handle both IPv4/6 networks while not being loaded with so many optional packages as to leave zero room post-install for customization. I&#039;ll most likely be periodically updating from SVN and pushing new builds from the backfire branch. I currently have no intentions to build out of attitude adjustment.</p><p>All files and .config can be found here: <a href="http://gotr00t.us/openwrt/backfire/ar71xx/">http://gotr00t.us/openwrt/backfire/ar71xx/</a></p><p><strong>Latest: 16 Dec 11 - r29557</strong> (<a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset?old_path=%2Fbranches%2Fbackfire&amp;old=29364&amp;new_path=%2Fbranches%2Fbackfire&amp;new=29557">Diff From Prev</a>)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Kline</strong> on 17 Dec 2011, 02:14)</p>

					<p>Just wanted to say thanks for this. I also use squid at the gateway and it does a good job. Especially for wireless clients connected to it.</p><p>I tried polipo, which is light weight compared to squid, but it crashes too often.</p>									</div>
