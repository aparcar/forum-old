					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m a bit stuck with this: where/how could I change the *default* country being put into /etc/config/wireless ?<br />I guess it&#039;s read from the EEPROM of the card (TL-MR3420) where it&#039;s stored wrong (US instead of DE) so I&#039;d like to change it in my custom image (using buildroot/trunk)<br />Any hints where to start?</p><br /><p>best regards</p><p>Michael</p>									</div>

					<p>Sure, that works fine, my question is how to change that already in the image without touching the config of the specific router which gets the image flashed manually.<br />I was able to find several other things in base-files etc. but this config-file seems to be automagically created somewhere.. </p><p>Makki</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry I didn&#039;t accurately read your post.&nbsp; Maybe adding insult to injury: I invoke the iw reg set in /etc/rc.local.&nbsp; Perhaps you could alter the image&#039;s default rc.local to include the country set you want?</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, that could be an interims way. (but is it &quot;the right way&quot;?)<br />Though, what I want and expect is the user should be able to change that using LuCI to what he thinks he lives in <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />so really, I only want to change the default on a fresh router from US (wrong value in EEPROM) to DE, it shouldn&#039;t get touched afterwards if there was something else manually configured in /etc/config/wireless (using rc.local would ovveride that I guess)</p><p>BTW, just on&nbsp; a side note for the archives: anybody also fiddling on this should also set CONFIG_ATH_USER_REGD=y otherwise you won&#039;t get Ch 12&amp;13 alive in Europe/JP on this box as it insists being US/World regulatory domain <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Makki</p>									</div>

					<p>FWIW, I do it thru rc.local because I found (on Dockstar and in some past version of trunk) that the /etc/config/wireless country setting line wasn&#039;t &quot;taking&quot; at boot.&nbsp; I had to restart the wireless via wifi down/wifi up.&nbsp; Not sure about whether this is a bug, but in any case, setting the country code in rc.local on boot works.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>yawlhoo</strong> on 22 Apr 2011, 03:12)</p>

					<p>arokh, thanks I found this but honestly I&#039;m still stuck *where* it gets it&#039;s default-settings from <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />As I said, I don&#039;t want to override this &quot;the hard way&quot; but only preset it once with a sane value without touching the router after flashing. If the user changes it in /etc/config/.. it should be used for whatever the user set there.</p><p>Makki</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t think there&#039;s a default country setting in /etc/config/wireless, like I said it&#039;s generated by mac80211.sh and you can see in that script how it&#039;s gonna look. No country option. Just add it and you have what you want. Default is set by EEPROM and overridden by /etc/config/wireless.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>arokh</strong> on 29 Apr 2011, 10:28)</p>

					<p>Sorry, I gave up, whatever I do in mac80211.sh (other than setting it &quot;hard&quot;), the box reads 0x0 regdom and sets country=US as default fresh or after a flash without keeping config. I guess it might be somewhere in hotplug..</p><p>Anyway, I worked around dirty now. -&gt; Is there an official or recommended way to implement things that should only be done once after flashing *with* a config-reset ? (i.e. keep not checked in luci or firstboot called)<br />I do it now by rc.local and a file which is remembered but thats anything but &quot;clean&quot;</p><p>Makki</p>									</div>
