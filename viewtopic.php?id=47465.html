					<p>Hello there.</p><p>I have my main network in 192.168.0. and I have an experimental network in 192.168.3.</p><ul><li><p>PC-1 (192.168.0.50) is connected to a Gateway (192.168.0.1)</p></li><li><p>The WAN port of a TP-Link MR-3420 (192.168.0.2) is also connected to said Gateway (192.168.0.1)</p></li><li><p>PC-2 (192.168.3.100) is connected to a LAN port of the TP-Link (192.168.3.1)</p></li><li><p>In LUCI, I set up a Port Forward from WAN port 3389 (RemoteDesktop) to LAN 192.168.3.100</p></li></ul><p>There is no Internet involved. Just two separated LANs.<br />I want to achieve, that a Remote Desktop request from PC-1 to 192.168.0.2 establishes a connection to PC-2.<br />I do NOT want to be able to ping PC-2 from PC-1. The two networks should be separated from each other.</p><p>I thought that if I forward port 3389, Remote Desktop requests to the TP-Link should be routed to PC-2.</p><p>Sadly that is not the case.<br />Remote Desktop says, it can&#039;t connect to 192.168.0.2 <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>Am I missing something?<br />The Windows Firewall is configured to accept Remote Desktop connections.<br />Is there any way to test, if a request for port 3389 is forwarded to PC-2 other than trying to establish a Remote Desktop connection?</p><p>To be honest, this is not directly related to OpenWRT, but since the TP-Link is running OpenWRT Attitude Adjustment 12 I hope someone here has some tips for me anyway <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Thank you,</p><p>Hubbard.</p>									</div>
