					<p>This is correct behaviour, using the &quot;-d&quot; option only changes the install location. If the package contains files to be placed in /etc/rc.d they will now be in /path/to/storage/etc/rc.d. If you want links, you&#039;ll need to install them yourself.</p><p>You could just make a script that overlays your external storage to the root filesystem using symlinks.</p>									</div>
