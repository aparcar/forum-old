					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I just got an Archer C2600 v1.1 and I&#039;d like to flash OpenWrt or LEDE from the web admin app if possible.&nbsp; I&#039;d also like for the OpenWrt or LEDE web interface (LuCI) to be part of the new firmware package by default.</p><p>From reading some posts here, it looks like LEDE is the way to go for v1.1 of the router?&nbsp; Should I download the LEDE firmware from the official project site or use a custom (newer?) build from this thread?</p><p>The main reason I want to load 3rd party firmware is to enable OpenVPN on the router.<br />Is it possible to configure LEDE to use OpenVPN for only one of the modems/frequencies (e.g. 5ghz)?&nbsp; Or do I need two wireless routers to have both VPN and non-VPN wireless internet options?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

In my signature, you can see all the pending issues. If you can find a v1.0 router, you&#039;re currently better off as the v1.1 has a reboot issue with a known fix (as far as I can tell, not integrated into LEDE but into Heinz&#039; builds). Dissent1 has made a patch for it, but I didn&#039;t see a specific PR for it come across, so I don&#039;t know if he ever actually put it in under another one.</p><p>Otherwise, all major functionality is working.</p>									</div>
