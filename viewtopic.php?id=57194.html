The odd thing is that now WIDIMM_blabla is not available anymore while it tries to join the other non-existing wifi. If I set disabled to 1 for the STA interface, then the WIDIMM_blabla becomes visible again. If I join my TP-LINK_boil network again, WIDIMM_blabla becomes visible after it manages to connect to the AP.</p><p>Why is my WIDIMM_blabla AP not visible anymore while I try to connect to a network that doesn&#039;t exist ? Is there a way to prevent this ?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>This is a peculiarity of how Atheros drivers (or is it mac80211 or hostapd?) work.&nbsp; If you have both STA and AP mode interfaces, the AP ones will become unavailable if the STA one isn&#039;t associated.</p><p>I tried finding an authoritative bit of documentation that explains that, but my Google searching powers are failing me for the moment.</p>									</div>
