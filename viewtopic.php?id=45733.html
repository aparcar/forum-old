					<p>Hi there!</p><p>I just upgraded my ALIX2 Router from Backfire 10.03.1 to Attitude Adjustment 12.09<br />As expected my UMTS internet connection doesn&#039;t work anymore.. I have these issues with every major upgrade *sigh*.</p><p>I found out that the size=8192 option for my Novatel Merlin XU870 card for loading usbserial is no longer there, so i got rid of it. Also there is a new module usb-serial-wwan or something like that which seems a prerequisite for usb-serial-option now.</p><p>All settings which were working perfectly on Backfire 10.03.1 for over 2years are set in LuCi. However i can&#039;t establish a connection. Looks like pppd does something strange and just hangs there waiting forever... </p><p>I can talk to the modem with gcom and query the status, signal-strength, info and that all seems to work fine, so the connection to the modem itself seems to be available. However somewhere in pppd it goes wrong. I enabled debug in /etc/ppp/options but it doesn&#039;t spit out any information as to what is wrong. It also does not seem to send the AT command to establish the connection with the APN - at least i don&#039;t get the expected Green/Yellow LED for an established UMTS connection on the UMTS modem card.</p><p>Here is the awesome log:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Aug 10 18:32:46 router kern.info kernel: [   24.273748] usbcore: registered new interface driver usbserial

					<p>Hi!</p><p>Thanks for the hint with &#039;route -n&#039;.<br />I am one big step further, after directly pinging the address 10.112.112.112, the on-demand connection for pppd kicked in and started the AT script, did the dialup andf established the connection. Yes i can type this via my normal connection. Great!</p><p>So looks like i have an issue with the on-demand dialing and the default gateway... Or default nameserver... If i do a ping on a random internet address e.g. <a href="http://www.openwrt.org">www.openwrt.org</a>, it should establish the connection. After 10 idle minutes it should disconnect again. Obviously i don&#039;t want a connection established if i ping local adresses.&nbsp; printer.lan laptop.lan wnas.lan </p><p>Edit:<br />Hm.. maybe this is my issue: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/12847">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/12847</a></p><p>Bests,<br />Tobias</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>TobsTec</strong> on 10 Aug 2013, 23:14)</p>

					<p>Ok it wasn&#039;t that ticket.

					<p>Ok after a weekend of clueless fiddling here is the worlds ugliest workaround to get on demand dialing working:</p><p>1) Change nodefaultroute to defaulteoute in ppp.sh<br />2) Set the DNS of the 3g-wan connection in the lan tab of LuCI<br />3) Disable getting DNS from 3G WAN connection<br />4) Add a (executable) shellscript to send &quot;ifup wan&quot; in /etc/ppp/ip-down.d/</p><br /><p>1 - Makes sure the defaultgateway and route are set<br />2 - As 3g-wan is killed by netifd if it times out we need to keep the DNS in lan so that it doesn&#039;t get removed as well.<br />3 - Doesn&#039;t harm but why twice the same DNS servers?<br />4 - Immediately restart wan if it is taken down by netifd. The pppd is only triggered when somebody tries to access the internet again.</p><p>It&#039;s ugly, but it seems to work!<br />I&#039;d really like to know how a real fix looks like though!!!<br />Imho netifd should not put 3g-wan down on a demand timeout.</p><p>Bests,<br />Tobias</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>TobsTec</strong> on 12 Aug 2013, 11:26)</p>
