					<p>Hello all,<br />I just bought a wdr4300 V1.6 router and I&#039;m really happy with the increased speeds.<br />I had a wrt150n before. This is a nice upgrade.<br />I managed to first install 15.05. Everything went smooth, managed to configure everything, but I noticed on the 2.4GHz interface I can&#039;t get past the 17dBm power setting. I have as an option also 18/19/20dBm. On either of those the TX power remains at 17dBm. Channel is set at 6, and BW at 40MHz as I live in a more remote area. I think I&#039;m the only one with wifi in a 500 meter radius. Also I tried turning the 5GHz interface off. I played with the country codes, tried Germany, US and Canada. Still no joy.<br />I&#039;ve read online that some managed to set it to 20dBm, in various firmwares (stock, dd-wrt, openwrt), but mine caps at 17dBm.<br />This happened in 15.05, 15.05.1, and now I&#039;m on 49975 with no change.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OW:~# iwinfo wlan0 txpower

I&#039;ve seen Andrew Mcneil&#039;s clip on Youtube on how to add two pigtails for 2.4GHz tuned antennas, also going to mod the original antennas for 5GHz. So I&#039;d like to extract all the juice the router can muster, without damaging it or breaking the law. Maybe add some heatsinks on the chips. What else could I try to get to 100mW on the 2.4Ghz interface?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bob808</strong> on 1 Nov 2016, 03:56)</p>

This is not really an issue right now.<br />I&#039;m trying to experiment with different wifi antennas for good 2.4GHz coverage upstairs as well. I don&#039;t want to &quot;set it to max power&quot;, I just want to be able to use the most the router can offer so I can test a good setup. Theoretically I&#039;d lower the power until I see that I loose signal quality, and leave it at that. But right now I want to be able to use everything the router is able to offer in terms of power output, in a way that doesn&#039;t damage the amplifiers. I presume a 20-22dBm is a max setting for 2.4GHz. I think I read somewhere that the 5GHz has a hardware cap at 20dBm but I&#039;m not sure. The 5GHz is not important right now as I can only use it on the first floor, and it provides good coverage already. 2.4GHz is what I want to tune.</p>									</div>

					<p>I found an image from pope&#039;s server. I think I figured it out.

The datasheet AR9341.pdf says 17 dBm on 2.4 MHz band is typical. It is probably safe to assume that the absolute maximum theoretical power for any consumer router ever designed is 23 dBm (200 mW) (incidentally, it would break the law to have more). There’re claims to the contrary on the internet; judge yourself. In practice, it’s probably more like 20 dBm (100 mW). Portable devices will deliver less than half that much. A typical laptop WiFi card will probably generate about 15 dBm (25 mW) radio power.</p>									</div>

					<p>I will open up the router again to have another look at the power amps for both bands. They should give me an idea on the real power. Also, I want to try and separate the 2.4GHz from 5GHz antenna traces. Just need to look up the datasheet for the power amps on the 2.4GHz on the recommended filter (should be a LC filter). This shouldn&#039;t be a complicated mod, and having separate antennas would improve the performance for both bands.<br />I am a bit curious, you say that there is that 23dBm limit. I&#039;ve seen some Alfa cards (want to play with one of those), that are 2000mW rated. Here&#039;s one at 28dBm for 11bg (~600mW) : <a href="https://www.alfa.com.tw/products_show.php?pc=67&amp;ps=241">https://www.alfa.com.tw/products_show.p … amp;ps=241</a><br />The AWUS036NHV is rated up to 32dBm (1600mW!!). Also I&#039;ve seen people testing them with lab gear and staying consistent at 31dBm...</p>									</div>

					<p>I identified the amplifiers used. They are made by Skyworks.<br />On the 5GHz line there are 3 x SE5005L amp chips : <a href="http://www.bdtic.com/DataSheet/Skyworks/SE5005L.pdf">http://www.bdtic.com/DataSheet/Skyworks/SE5005L.pdf</a><br />On the 2.4GHz line there are 2 x SE2574BL-R amp chips: <a href="http://www.skyworksinc.com/uploads/documents/SE2574BL_R_202675A.pdf">http://www.skyworksinc.com/uploads/docu … 02675A.pdf</a></p><p>SE5005L has a rating of 18dBm Output power for 54Mbps, and has an integrated filter, draws 200mA at max power output.<br />Also I see that for MCS0 HT20 - there’s a stated output of 22dBm, but that’s not 450Mbps <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> So basically for 11a with an EVM of 3% you gain 18dBm. The compression point starts at 22-25dBm so forcing past that point it would heat the chip and loose power actually.</p><p>SE2574BL-R has a rating of 21dBm for 11b and 18.5dBm for 11g. Also has a filter included. The chip draws 165mA at 20dBm for 11b, and 140mA at 18dBm for 11g. Basically almost 1A with all amps to the max. The compression point starts at about 25dBm, so you could theoretically push these chips a bit.</p><p>I hope I read the datasheets correctly. I presume a 19dBm should be ok for both bands. More than that and you get diminishing returns.<br />The way to get more performance out of it at this point is to separate the 2.4GHz from the 5GHz line, and add proper antennas on both. Should make for really nice coverage this way while not being a beast.</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s hard to separate the RF-stage without adding additional loses due to impedance mismatching. You may look for good dual band antennas or make them by yourself. <br />Beside this, this router never will be a 2,4Ghz beast.<br />Instead of patching ART you can also make some minor tweaks in the sources to handle too restrictive regulations <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Impedance mismatching between the two bands? That shouldn&#039;t matter as there are different chips handling the data.<br />Impedance mismatching between the two 2.4GHz traces, then right now they are not equal. One is longer than the other by a fair bit, and I see they didn&#039;t take any action on that on the physical layout of the traces. No squiggly traces to match the length of both lines.<br />I was thinking of soldering the center of the coax directly on the capacitor, on both 2.4GHz lines.</p>									</div>

					<p>I noted the traces in the photos down below.<br />Clearly the traces are not equal. With equal pigtails I presume the lines would be pretty balanced. The mesh can be connected on the golden traces I presume. Removing the cap and soldering it 90 degrees offset should break the link to the 5GHz line, or just destroy the via next to the cap.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9ntV4O8.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/9ntV4O8.jpg" /></span></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/AdKkkSr.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/AdKkkSr.jpg" /></span></p>									</div>
