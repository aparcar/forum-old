					<p>Okay, now i got the same router status 3 times doing only one setting change and then apply it. It doesn&#039;t belong to MAC address change. All three times i got that some kind of &#039;bricked router&#039; when i change to &quot;40MHz and above channel&quot; in wifi section. All symptoms are the same as my first time: i switch this option from &quot;20MHz&quot; to &quot;40 and above&quot;, apply it, webgui tried to reload and timeout. Router keeps ip&#039;s, SSID and blah blah blah, blink all LEDs as normal, wifi scanners shows network encription, etc., accept my WEP key and so on. But NO access to webgui, no ping to router, connect but cannot put any file to router using tftp.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;d say bricked is a pretty bold claim, you seriously need to brake u-boot in a flash attempt in order to be unable to restore with the download mode. When you do break u-boot there&#039;s still JTAG access, though JTAG from scratch is the one bit about the wrt350nv2 where we are in the dark. Cause Linksys didn&#039;t provide us the full sources... but still, with time that should be possible.</p><p>If you ask me u-boot&#039;s the only thing needs patching in order to call this device fully supported.</p><p>- edit -<br />One more thought about changing MAC addresses. Sure it&#039;s good to having set the proper MACs to all interfaces, however, if you only use one wrt350n in your network you really don&#039;t need to change the MAC in order for the device to work. Okay, so maybe you have an ISP which requires a certain MAC, you&#039;ll only need to set the MAC for your WAN side, which is already supported in the /etc/config/network script. If it gives you so much trouble why not wait for a new release from OpenWRT which includes the MAC patch.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dirkNL</strong> on 9 Apr 2010, 01:46)</p>

Sure it&#039;s good to having set the proper MACs to all interfaces, however, if you only use one wrt350n in your network you really don&#039;t need to change the MAC in order for the device to work. Okay, so maybe you have an ISP which requires a certain MAC, you&#039;ll only need to set the MAC for your WAN side, which is already supported in the /etc/config/network script. If it gives you so much trouble why not wait for a new release from OpenWRT which includes the MAC patch.</p></blockquote></div><p>yes, that&#039;s true.

					<p>Hello everybody,</p><p>I am not a linux expert, but when I saw that the Backfire OpenWrt 10.03 was finally released, I decided to use it on my WNR854T router.</p><p>After some time and some worries (I lost once the Luci interface when I tried to remove the english interface), it is running without too many issues. I have however one concern: it is not really clearly described in the device page, but the Wifi does not seem to be supported (it is written &quot;disabled&quot; not &quot;not available&quot;...). I also read in this thread that there was some work on the wifi driver: could someone tell me when this function will eventually be available ?</p><p>Thank you in advance</p><p>PS: all my interfaces&#039; MAC adresses are wrong but that does not seem to create issues (as far as I can see..).</p>									</div>
