					<p>I just installed Kamikaze 8.09RC1 tonight via TFTP flash. The flash went great, and I rebooted, swapped the ethernet cable to switch port #1, and connected to 192.168.1.1. I logged in, and then the confusion set in. It&#039;s like X-wrt, but yet not. With that said, I cannot find how to activate wifi via the webGUI anywhere.</p><p><strong>Going to network:wifi, there are no devices available in the list. Is this normal? How can i get wifi working?</strong></p><p>I know nothing about bridged networks and the like, so perhaps I am missing something. Is anyone elese having trouble with no wireless devices available on a wgt634u running 8.09RC1?</p><p>Under 7.09 I could use wifi just fine. For the record, the wgt634u is a Brcm47xx device, so wifi should be supported. Do I perhaps need to download or configure madwifi to make it work? The router is a broadcom board with an Atheros mini-PCI card. Others on the forum seem to have 8.09RC1 working with wifi on this router.</p><p>Should I grab a fresh snapshot and reflash? (Please don&#039;t make me haul out the USB to TTL card again, tell me I can flash from within the webGUI, please, please, please)</p>									</div>

					<p>Note that I am lucky to have two WGT634U. One is a wireless client/print/torrent/whatever server for playing.&nbsp; The other is for my DSL.&nbsp; I tried out 8.09RC1 on the one for playing and did not try the PPPoE DSL thing with 8.09RC1.</p><p>I installed the Kmod-madwifi with the LuCI GUI and rebooted. The magically the /etc/wireless file had stuff in it and the LuCI GUI had a nice entry for WIFI0 in it.</p><p>I cannot advise about PPPoE DSL stuff but the vlan stuff I mentioned is probably affecting you.&nbsp; Just swap 0 and 4 in /etc/config/network or with LuCI on the switch page.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>--------------------------

Just get the file(s) to /tmp (wget it to there)and install with opkg on the command line or even download all the packages to a local server and edit your ?/etc/ipkg.conf file.</p><p>I went back to 7.09 already because it works just fine and I just wanted to see LuCI.</p><br /><p>EDIT:<br />Flashing from the GUI back to 7.09 does not work.&nbsp; I flashed back like this from some of my notes.&nbsp; You have to use the trx file!!

It was already correct.<br />However, in the LuCI interface I had to change Firewall:Zones to accept incoming traffic. Then suddenly everything worked.</p><p>The I installed madwifi as follows:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# opkg update</code></pre></div><p>This downloads the latest list of packages available. This must be done after every reboot before you can download any new packages.<br />Followed by:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# opkg install kmod-madwifi</code></pre></div><p>I then rebooted the router and I had WIFI0 under wifi in LuCI. I changed the SSID and configured my setting as needed. I realized I needed WPA-PSK, so I needed to download hostapd to allow it.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# opkg update
root@OpenWrt:~# opkg install hostapd
root@OpenWrt:~# reboot</code></pre></div><p>Now I had WPA available as options in LuCI under Wifi:WIFI0:Interfaces. I set my pre-shared key and rebooted again. and I was done.</p><p>As a side note, I would recomend installing the <em>luci-app-ntpc</em> to add a time client to the router and keep it&#039;s time acurate. Make sure to set it&#039;s update time to something reasonable like 21600 seconds (6 hours) so you don&#039;t hammer the server. You might also change the first server to Time. Nist.Gov<br />I also recomend installing <em>luci-app-upnp</em> if you need UPNP service on your router.</p>									</div>
