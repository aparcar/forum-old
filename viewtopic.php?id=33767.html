					<p>I feel very dumb for posting this, but...<br />I recently bought a TP-Link WR1043ND v1.8 and flashed it with OpenWRT Backfire 10.03.1.</p><p>After configuring *only* PPPoE, it says it&#039;s connected, but I can&#039;t ping (from the router via SSH or from the PC) any external IP address, like 8.8.8.8 (Google&#039;s DNS).</p><p>What I observed is that just after configuring PPPoE, my PC is able to ping 8.8.8.8 for a few seconds, and then it stops.</p><p>I searched the forums, Google and the Wiki, but I couldn&#039;t find any noob-proof guide to configure my internet connection.</p><p>I didn&#039;t touch any other configuration: only WAN&#039;s setting, changed from DHCP to PPPoE, set username and password.</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>									</div>
