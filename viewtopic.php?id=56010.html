					<p>Working to install OpenWrt Barrier Breaker 14.07 / LuCI Trunk (0.12+svn-r10530) on a MikroTik RouterBOARD 951G-2HnD.</p><p>DNS is not working out of the box.<br />WAN is by DHCP and the status-page tells, that the router knows the dns-servers from dhcp.</p><p>I can only get dns-servers to clients behid the router, if I add them as dhcp-options on the lan-interface&#039;s dhcp-options and as DHCPandDNS dns-forwardings.</p><p>But the router itself is not using those dns-servers. It cannot install software-packages, as it cannot resolv downloads.openwrt.org.</p><p>The system-log has a lot of entries with:<br />daemon.warn odhcpd[698]: A default route is present but there is no public prefix on br-lan thus we don&#039;t announce a default route!</p><p>Any advice on what is wrong ?</p>									</div>

					<p>GO ahead and install DDWRT. DDNS works like a sharm.. OpenWRT is not best solution for DDNS. Also BB is known for less internet performances..</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>deanMKD</strong> on 1 Mar 2015, 01:07)</p>

					<p>According to the DD-WRT routerdatabase only 4 Mikrotik devices are supported, and the 951 is not among them.</p><p>My problem is not with dynamic dns. I have not tried it and I do not need it.</p><p>It is the router itself that is not seeing or using any dns-servers. The diagnostic program cannot ping openwrt.org. I need the router to run a openvpn-client, but it cannot find the remote vpn-server by the servers FQDN.</p>									</div>
