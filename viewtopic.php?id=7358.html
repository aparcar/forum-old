					<p>I&#039;ve been playing with almost an identical scenerio... it seems as if the pl2303 driver has some issues.&nbsp; from what I&#039;ve noticed... on the transmit side... data keeps getting truncated at the very least.&nbsp; I was in the process of deb0rking it... but got tied up with other projects.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, <br />I was thinking if I can use the serial hack on RC5 as described in wiki, connected to the modem 56.6K, would that work to get a dial in connection with pppd and mgetty?<br />Does anyone has any experience with it?</p><p>Thanks<br />-B</p>									</div>
