					<p>Is it possible to sniff (with tcpdump) or mirror LAN traffic that doesn&#039;t get routed to WAN using openWRT?&nbsp; Say&nbsp; I have two PCs connected to LAN ports and I want to sniff on traffic one PC is sending to the other one? <br />--tee feature is of no use in this case as nothing gets routed and therefore iptables cannot pick it.<br />I have read somewhere that such thing might be possible by implementing VLANs but frankly I don&#039;t understand how. I have openWRT firmware on DIR-300 and Linksys E1200.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>astralmaster</strong> on 26 Sep 2015, 15:01)</p>
