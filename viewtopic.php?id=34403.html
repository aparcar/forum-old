					<p>I tried to intall luci-app-ddns through the luci web interface, but it terminated with an error message (too bad I did not make a screenshot). Since then Luci is no more working. When I start the web interface in the browser typing 192.168.1.1, a black website flashes briefly and then an empty website appears, url is <a href="http://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/luci">http://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/luci</a>. <br />SSh still works and the router works, too. Restarting the router did not help. Is there a way to find out what is broken and fix it through ssh?</p>									</div>

					<p>/overlay is 12% used. Since I did not customize a lot, saving setting is not necessary. I&#039;d be happy to have a clean new system. Is there any other reason you say I should save /overlay? Does running firstboot give me a clean new system?</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes it does. Your error happens if you install components belonging to an old version on a newer versioned LuCI, usually because opkg.conf was backed up and points to a now outdated repo.</p>									</div>

					<p>firstboot is what you want. It will return your router to the state just after you installed OpenWRT. All sw installed or configs will be lost. I generally save it all because some files does not get into the backup files if they are not explicity listed.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks. I first installed 10.03 and then installed the upgrade to 10.03.1. If I run firstboot, is it equivalent to having an image of 10.03.1 installed in the first place? Can the problem with Luci be due to a version conflict because of installing 10.03 first and then the upgrade?</p>									</div>
