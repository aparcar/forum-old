					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am wondering, and likely know the answer, but figured I would ask in case I was missing something.</p><p>I want to have a Mini PCIe card installed in a router, acting as an AP, that allows both 2.4 and 5ghz connections, simultaneously.</p><p>Is this possible with a single card?&nbsp; I suspect not, but if anyone can say for sure, please let me know.</p><p>I know I can have multiple &quot;networks&quot; on a single 2.4 WiFi card, but all networks must be on the same channel (frequency).&nbsp; So I am guessing the same is true for a dual-band card.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>I looked for this about a year back and did not find any.&nbsp; </p><p>I will suggest you be careful with any card and should write the vendor&#039;s support and ask about SIMULTANEOUS dual band.&nbsp; This card for example seems to meet the requirement, but I know will not run both at the same time.&nbsp; Only one or the other.<br /><a href="http://www.pcengines.ch/pdf/wle200nx.pdf">http://www.pcengines.ch/pdf/wle200nx.pdf</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Like jow said, you cannot physically run one single card at multiple frequencies simultaneously. Simultaneous dual band <strong>always</strong> implies you have actually two separate radios.</p>									</div>
