					<p>I was looking around for a router to use for a small mesh network (OLSR). It really does not have to be anything great, I am looking for something cheap since I am going to need multiple units.&nbsp; It is just for sharing the internet between a few houses (relatives) that live around me. </p><p>I was looking into the Fonera as I can get 4 of them for &quot;$110&quot; or &quot;$135â€ ,depending on if I can get a discount, or if anyone knows another way to get them cheaper that would be great also. (maybe for $100 if i have 4 differant people order them)</p><p>I found some refurbished WRT54G V 1.1 units for $39.... </p><p>Any other way to go about this or any issues you might see me facing with the fonera&#039;s?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>One thing you might want to be aware of is &quot;BSSID partitioning&quot;.&nbsp; Some chip/driver combinations are vulernable and others are not. Any one that is susceptible to partitioning is not suitable for a mesh node.</p><p> From the OLSR mailing list:</p><p>BSSID partitioning is something that happens at the MAC sublayer.&nbsp; In<br />older designs, the MAC sublayer is implemented in firmware; in newer<br />(``softmac&#039;&#039;) designs, the MAC sublayer is implemented in the driver.</p><p>In current Linux kernels, softmac designs use a common MAC implementation,<br />originally known as Devicescape and now renamed to mac80211.&nbsp; Mac80211<br />does suffer from BSSID partitioning up to and including 2.6.26, but<br />this has been fixed in the current net-2.6 tree; hence, this issue<br />should be solved by 2.6.27 for all drivers using mac80211.&nbsp; (But<br />I haven&#039;t tested it.)</p><p>After this short introduction, here&#039;s what I know about Linux drivers.</p><p>Atheros is a softmac design.&nbsp; There are two drivers, the partly-binary<br />madwifi and the reverse-engineered ath5k.&nbsp; Madwifi has its own MAC<br />implementation, and does not suffer from BSSID partitioning.&nbsp; Older<br />versions of the Madwifi drivers had issues with ad-hoc mode, but<br />I believe that they have been solved by now.&nbsp; (Can anyone confirm<br />that?)&nbsp; Ath5k uses mac80211, see above.</p><p>Broadcom is a softmac design.&nbsp; The binary-only ``wl&#039;&#039; driver has its<br />own MAC implementation, and does suffer from BSSID partitioning.&nbsp; The<br />reverse-engineered ``b43&#039;&#039; driver uses mac80211, see above.</p><p>Intel has two distinct families of hardware designs which are handled<br />by the ipw2200 and iwlwifi drivers respectively.&nbsp; The ipw2200 family<br />is a hardmac design, and I believe that it does not suffer from BSSID<br />partitioning (can anyone confirm that?).&nbsp; The more recent iwlwifi<br />family is softmac and uses mac80211, see above.</p><p>Ralink is softmac, and uses mac80211, see above.&nbsp; However, older<br />versions of the ralink driver did not support ad-hoc mode at all;<br />I haven&#039;t checked whether this has been fixed in recent releases.</p>									</div>
