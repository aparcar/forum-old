					<p>Hi all.</p><p>Reading some of the posts on Hackaday it seems that the earlier (WAGx34) Netgear routers can be hacked to control servos.</p><p>My ideas is to use a pair of model aircraft servos and a PIC so that upon receiving a ping on a certain port the router flashes a spare LED pair&nbsp; (i.e. unused network *3 and *4) with a pair of ping length determined pulse widths that then tell the PIC to move the servos to the location specified.</p><p>Problem is the &quot;donor&quot; router got bricked by a failed attempt at flash upgrading via wifi.</p><p>I&#039;ve purchased another and managed to JTAG its old firmware across but it won&#039;t flash a single byte yet it reads OK.</p><p>Any ideas? Am using STJTAG</p><p>Have the original firmware on here <a href="http://www.cwgsy.net/private/mandoline/DG834GV4.zip.zip">www.cwgsy.net/private/mandoline/DG834GV4.zip.zip</a></p><p>regards, -A</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>conundrum1066</strong> on 2 Apr 2009, 15:00)</p>
