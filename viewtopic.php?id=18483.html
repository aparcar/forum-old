					<p>Hello,</p><p>As I&#039;m quite a fan of alternative firmware for devices, I&#039;ve been sniffing around OpenWRT for ages looking for support for the Linksys WAG54GX2 ADSL Router. I gave up some while ago, but recently came across this changelog:</p><p><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/13001">https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/13001</a></p><p>This changelog indicates that the WAG54GX2 is now supported, but I&#039;m puzzled as to what package I upload to the router? Does anyone know which package release I need to use, any any snags I would come across, and if I need to do anything different than just upload via the current web interface.</p><p>Help would be greatly appreciated!</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>J</p>									</div>
