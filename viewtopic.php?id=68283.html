					<p>I have a Linksys WRT1200AC with a Marvell Armada 385 88F6820 CPU runnning @ 2x1300Mhz. </p><p>This is the SAME CPU used on WRT1900AC v2 but in this case its clocked @ 2x1600Mhz.</p><p>Seems safe to overclock WRT1200AC cpu to 2x1600Mhz. </p><p>In my research i found maybe i can do it using NVRAM to set CPU clock to 1600MHz and keep memory clock at 800 MHz:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>nvram set clkfreq=1600,800
nvram commit &amp;&amp; reboot</code></pre></div><p>Any idea if this can work? Should i do anything else?</p><p>I dont want to try it without any confirmation this can work and wont surely brick my router.</p>									</div>

I found some info about nvram on older Openwrt releases (AA and older) and just assumed is still present on Openwrt.</p><p>Maybe in the future the overclock may be possible. In the meantime the cpu power is suficcient, after all the overall cpu usage during the day is about 0,02%.</p>									</div>
