					<p>I would be interested in doing the same, my board identifies as &quot;PPV3&quot; (=PogoPlug Pro V3?) but on the device label it says Model: &quot;POGO-B04&quot;. I see that there is <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/oxnas/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/oxnas/</a> where it talks about &quot;pogoplug-pro&quot;. </p><p><strong>This post talks about the oxnas-based PogoPlug systems, NOT about the kirkwood-based ones.</strong> On my device with stock firmware, it says:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>~ # cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep Hardware
Hardware    : Oxsemi NAS

~ # uname -a
Linux Pogoplug 2.6.31.6_SMP_820 #96 SMP Tue Feb 8 12:08:54 PST 2011 armv6l GNU/Linux</code></pre></div><p>Unfortunately I could not find any information on how to install OpenWrt on the PPV3 on the OpenWrt site. The only references I found were some Chinese web pages which I tried to translate using Google. Especially <a href="http://bbs.fishlee.net/thread-3356-1-1.html">http://bbs.fishlee.net/thread-3356-1-1.html</a> seems to be the most verbose. It does not talk about the official trunk/oxnas, but maybe the instructions are similar.</p><p>This is what I figured out from reading the page. <span style="color: #FF0000"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Do NOT do this unless you know what you are doing. You might BRICK your system. I have NOT tried the below and parts of it are just guessed based on the information on the net.</span> If someone is willing to test the procedure and can confirm that it works, please let me know so that we can create a wiki page with the instructions.</p><p><strong>1. Connect via the serial console and prepare TFTP on your host computer</strong></p><p>Set the host computer&#039;s IP address to 192.168.1.100, gateway 192.198.1.1, subnet mask 255.255.255.0. Launch a TFTP server on the host computer that serves the files from <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/oxnas/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/oxnas/</a></p><p>You need a serial console to the PPV3. For this you have to open the device, and connect a serial to USB converter to the RX, TX and GND pins.</p><p>Connect the PPV3 to power while pressing ESC or SPACE on the serial console. This should get you into a U-Boot bootloader shell.</p><p><strong>2. Load new U-Boot bootloader</strong></p><p>Enter the following:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>setenv ipaddr 192.168.1.1
setenv serverip 192.168.1.100
tftp 64000000 openwrt-oxnas-ox820-u-boot.bin
setenv boot_openwrt nand read 0x64000000 0x440000 0x90000 \; go 64000000
setenv bootcmd run boot_openwrt
saveenv
go 64000000</code></pre></div><p>The last command launches a new U-Boot version, which also needs to be interrupted with ESC, hence press ESC after you entered the bootm command.</p><p><strong>3. Load new kernel and initramfs including the OpenWrt web interface</strong></p><p>Once you see the new U-Boot console, enter the following:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>setenv ipaddr 192.168.1.1
setenv serverip 192.168.1.100
nand erase 0x440000 0x90000
nand write 64000000 0x440000 0x90000
tftpboot 0x62000000 openwrt-oxnas-pogoplug-pro-fit-uImage-initramfs.itb
bootm</code></pre></div><p><strong>4. Use the OpenWrt web interface to flash sysupgrade</strong></p><p>Once the operation has finished, the device can be accessed from the browser at 192.168.1.1, username root, password blank. From here on, you can use the OpenWrt GUI to flash the firmware image. Go to System -&gt; Flash Operations, select the firmware package file openwrt-oxnas-pogoplug-pro-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin and press the &quot;Flash image...&quot; button. Thre rest is a normal OpenWrt GUI sysupgrade procedure.</p><p>ATTENTION: You should leave the serial console connected while doing this, and you should watch the output for possible errors. The Chinese page mentions that the process is somewhat flaky and sometimes it is necessary to repeat the step a couple of times.</p><p><strong>5. Report your experience</strong></p><p>If someone is willing to test the procedure and can confirm that it works, please let me know so that we can create a wiki page with the instructions. Please also include the <strong>exact</strong> &quot;Model:&quot; information from the sticker on the bottom of your device (mine says: &quot;Model: POGO-B04&quot;).</p><p>In case of disk mount problems the Chinese page recommends to change /etc/config/fstab to contain:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config global
   option anon_swap &#039;0&#039;
   option anon_mount &#039;0&#039;
   option auto_swap &#039;1&#039;
   option auto_mount &#039;1&#039;
   option delay_root &#039;5&#039;
   option check_fs &#039;0&#039;</code></pre></div>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>probono</strong> on 28 Dec 2014, 12:48)</p>

					<p>I don&#039;t own a Pogoplug Pro, sorry. FWIW, kernel 3.14.9 was introduced in r41362, the oxnas target came later in r43388 built with kernel 3.18, and later switched back to kernel 3.14 in r43521. So I believe <em>every</em> build from openwrt.org is &quot;kernel 3.14.9 or later&quot;.</p>									</div>

#####Initial Boot via Telnet######
#set passwd and enable ssh
passwd

#Reconfigure Network to DHCP Client
#disable dhcp server on lan
uci set dhcp.lan.ignore=1
uci commit dhcp
/etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart

#set wired ethernet interface to dhcp client

Plug the Pogoplug and your computer back into your network. Check your router for the IP Address assigned to your Pogoplug. You should now be able to SSH into the Pogoplug.</code></pre></div>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>LeggoMyEggo</strong> on 29 Mar 2015, 04:29)</p>

					<p>OK I was able to eventually get it to get a dhcp address on my LAN if I manually edited the /etc/config/network file using vi.&nbsp; I could then SSH to the plug over my LAN once I set the root password in serial console.&nbsp; So when I then tried to update the plug with opkg and load all the base packages including Luci,&nbsp; I instantly ran out of available storage space and I am not sure how to put the rootfs on external storage using exroot and block-mount.&nbsp; &nbsp;It should be noted that the installation of u-boot per the above is not complete, there is no permanent boot enviroment file stored that survived a reboot so each time I rebooted, I had to go through all the steps from the beginning.&nbsp; </p><p>I think my biggest problem at this point in making this work without intervention is having NOT started from a stock u-boot configuration.&nbsp; The bodhi/doozan u-boot I am using probably overlays or overlaps the areas the OpenWRT u-boot is stored and prevents the proper installation of the OWRT environment.&nbsp; I am sure it could work eventually but at this point for me it&#039;s too much work for this particular device and I erased the OWRT u-boot and rootfs and re-flashed the bodhi u-boot and environment.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>LeggoMyEggo</strong> on 30 Mar 2015, 04:49)</p>

					<p>On further reflection, there might be a way to get this to work even though I have a modern bootloader already on the device.&nbsp; Becasue the Oxnas chip first looks to the sata interface for the bin boot file, I might be able to write the openwrt-oxnas-ox820-u-boot.bin file as stage 1 per the technique mentioned here:&nbsp; <a href="http://forum.doozan.com/read.php?3,16017,19718#msg-19718.">http://forum.doozan.com/read.php?3,1601 … msg-19718.</a>&nbsp; While it should work, I am not sure what to put in the boot environment file.&nbsp; Also, I don&#039;t know what effect having the firmware on sata has on the ability to be able to consistently boot OWRT without the serial console supervision I mention above.&nbsp; </p><p>I might end up picking up a stock Pro just to test if I can avoid all this aggravation and load the new firmware on nand and then have the ability to have unsupervised booting to OWRT.&nbsp; That would be great as I would like to use an Atheros ath9k mini pci-e card as an AP for a room in my place.</p>									</div>

					<p>I hear an echo in here....................</p><p>Hey if someone has a stock Pogoplug Pro (without a modified u-boot) they can try the installation routine on it would be helpful to know how this goes.&nbsp; In particular to see if the firmware installation sticks and is saved in nand.&nbsp; My Pogoplug has an updated u-boot so I have to chain-load the OpenWRT u-boot.&nbsp; Even after successfully booting,&nbsp; the OpenWRT installation does not &quot;stick&quot; so I have to go through the whole process from the beginning each time I attempt to install. </p><p>Again, if someone could try this with a stock plug it would be helpful.</p>									</div>

So actually you can use the classic dtb on both the Pro and non-Pro. At this point since the PCIE WiFi card doesn&#039;t work, no point in using the pro dtb file.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Also, is there a particular reason to keep the Debian u-boot over the u-boot that comes with the OpenWrt build?

Maybe it&#039;s because back when I first tried, the openwrt-oxnas target was still quite experimental and if the u-boot didn&#039;t work, you could always fall back to the factory one (insufficient for OpenWrt, but good enough to jumpstart the unit and reflash).</p>									</div>

					<p>The other day, I posted <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=56794">this</a> in the developer forum sans any response. I thought to mention it here to see if anyone has seen such a kernel setting for OXNAS platform. Knowing OXNAS platform is a 32-bit, I just raise my eyebrow me to see the Linux kernel default setting for an OXNAS platform is set to 64-bit.</p>									</div>
