					<p>Hello,<br />I am an old user of OpenWrt and I&#039;m coming back to use OpenWrt after one year. I have installed the new 8.09 RC2 on my WRT54GL.<br />Maybe I&#039;m going to do a stupid question.<br />My AP receives the right dns servers by WAN side and correctly works. But my PCs connected to the Linksys don&#039;t receive the DNS from the AP, so that I have to manually set them.<br />What is the cleanest way to do this? Is it possible to do it by UCI variables? Do I need some particular packages?<br />Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi.</p><p>Do you mean that the clients don&#039;t get the isp dns servers? That is normal since per default, the openwrt dnsmasq acts as a dns cache between your clients and the isp.</p><p>Or are your clients unable to resolve dns at all?</p><p>~ JoW</p>									</div>

					<p>In a regular setup openwrt comes with dnsmasq enabled which acts as a caching dns proxy for local clients. It automaticly uses the dns servers from wan uplink as forwarders. There should be no need to configure the clients.</p><p>If you still want to set the dns servers on the clients you should use dhcp settings on the router.</p>									</div>

					<p>If anyone&#039;s curious, try using OpenDNS instead of the ISP DNS servers: sometimes they happen to be faster. <a href="http://www.opendns.com">http://www.opendns.com</a>/</p>									</div>
