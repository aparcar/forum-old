					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to expand my wifi range in the house. I&#039;ve got the current router/AP at one end of a cable which goes across the house. I want to place a 2nd AP at the other end, but I want devices to seamlessly connect to the 2 APs. It&#039;s similar to WDS, except that I don&#039;t want the 2nd AP routing packets over wifi to the 1st. I want it to use ethernet for this.<br />I tried (the longshot) to use the 2nd as AP with same wifi parameters (dhcp on 1st over eth), but the switchover it painful.<br />A picture of my intentions:</p><p>&lt;DLS modem&gt;===&lt;TL-WR1043ND&gt;=======&lt;new router&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;wifi1&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;wifi2&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;wifi3&gt;</p><p>Do you have any ideas?</p><p>My 1st AP is TPLink TL-WR1043ND...the 2nd has to be bought. Testing was done with a &quot;mobile&quot; Asus WL-330GE&quot;, which has &quot;repeater&quot; mode (which I think is a fully working WDS).</p>									</div>

					<p>what you want to accieve has nothing to do with WDS, the clients are just roaming between the APs. <br />Roaming (with no encryption or psk) is mostly a client-thing, but there are some standards e.g. 802.11f (IAAP) and 802.11r. this protocols are implemented in hostapd but I&#039;m not sure if it works under openwrt. (maybe you have to run hostapd with a custom config)</p><p>If you are using only psk-authentication and no enterprise-authentication you should be fine with setting the same ssid on all APs and brigde them to the same LAN-segment. The wifi-driver of the client has to scan for other accesspoints in the background and then needs to connect to the accesspoint with the better signal. There isn&#039;t much to do on the AP, take a look if you can tweak your wifi-settings of your client.</p>									</div>

					<p>Roaming works mighty fine here. But I run unencrypted. </p><p>At some point I even had the same ESSID for my 2.4 and my 5GHz APs, but then it turned out that some clients were always connecting to the wrong APs, so I split 2.4 and 5.</p><p>Just remember to plug the into the LAN ports.</p>									</div>
