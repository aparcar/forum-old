					<p>Hello to everyone!</p><p>I have purchased a RavPower RV-WD02 and started to use OpenWRT on it for a while now. And I&#039;ve been using it as a wireless client travel router. So, where I go, I connect my router to any wifi near and connect my devices to my wifi. The config was made using LuCI.</p><p>Even if I want to use it as a wireless client, I need to have, everytime, a network cable (a RJ45 cable) to configure it to use the Wifi I want the router to connect to. To explain this, I need to use a example.</p><p>Let&#039;s say that I use my WD02 to connect to my HomeWIFI, it will then be configured to every time the router is turned on, it will try to connect to my HomeWIFI. It works flawlessly and I am able no navigate using it. After that I go to my work. There, I need to reconfigure my travel router to connect to a new WiFi. It is at this point that the problem arrives.<br />Because the travel router is configured to use my HomeWIFI, when it boots, it tries to connect to my HomeWIFI and&nbsp; fails. If the router is not able to connect, it won&#039;t turn on it&#039;s wifi. So I am not able no reconfigure it, only If I use a cable, connect to it&#039;s RJ45 and access LuCI again (or CLI).</p><p>So, here&#039;s my question: is there any way to force the WD02 to turn ON the wireless radio even if the router can&#039;t connect to a WiFi?</p><p>I hope I was able to explain it.</p><p>Thank&#039;s for reading and, as we Brazilians always say: sorry for my bad English. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, you can have a script running on your router which disables the STA interface if it can&#039;t connect (and then you can connect to AP). There&#039;re multitudes of those in this forum.</p><p>Not sure if the router you have has a slider (like D-Link DIR 505 does) for different modes, but if it did, you could program each setting of the slider, like position 1 would be home, position 2 work and position 3 would boot into just AP with STA disabled so you could configure it thru Luci.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you stangri for your help!</p><p>For those who come here seeking for a solution, I solved my problem with &quot;travelmate&quot; package. There is a thread here in the forums. I am not allowed to link it here, but you can search for &quot;package &#039;travelmate&#039;, a wlan connection manager for travel router&quot;.</p>									</div>
