					<p>Today was unable to ping hosts from client boxes except when IP address used. But when logged into to OpenWrt box, could ping anyone by name or by IP. It appear the dnsmasq had quit working (although it was still on the &#039;ps ax&#039; list).&nbsp; </p><p>Also, in /var/log/messages, before dnsmasq quit, saw periodic messages that looked like this:</p><p>Apr&nbsp; 5 14:13:16 (none) kern.info dnsmasq[21254]: reading /etc/resolv.conf&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Apr&nbsp; 5 14:13:16 (none) kern.info dnsmasq[21254]: using nameserver 42.158.96.131#53&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Apr&nbsp; 5 14:13:16 (none) kern.info dnsmasq[21254]: using nameserver 42.158.96.130#53&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Apr&nbsp; 5 14:13:16 (none) kern.info dnsmasq[21254]: using local addresses only for domain localhost.localdomain</p><p>But after dnsmasq &#039;quit&#039;, the log looked like this:</p><p>Apr&nbsp; 5 14:13:16 (none) kern.info dnsmasq[21254]: reading /etc/resolv.conf&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Apr&nbsp; 5 14:13:16 (none) kern.info dnsmasq[21254]: using local addresses only for domain localhost.localdomain</p><p>(ISP&#039;s nameserve did not listed even though still in /etc/resolv.conf.</p><p>When I killed dnsmasq and restarted it via /etc/init.d/S50dnsmasq script was able to ping by name again from client hosts and saw first type of message set in log again.</p><p>Anyone seen this behavior with their OpenWrt and dnsmasq after a period of time?</p>									</div>

					<p>as far as I can tell (i.e. this is a guess), you should only be seeing one message like:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Apr  5 14:13:16 (none) kern.info dnsmasq[21254]: reading /etc/resolv.conf
Apr  5 14:13:16 (none) kern.info dnsmasq[21254]: using nameserver 42.158.96.131#53                                                             
Apr  5 14:13:16 (none) kern.info dnsmasq[21254]: using nameserver 42.158.96.130#53</code></pre></div><p>this is dnsmasq starting and reading resolv.conf to send the information to clients on your lan, which (resolv.conf) i guess is setup by the dhcp client for the wan interface. if you are seeing this message many times, then it is my guess that something is causing dnsmasq to die. this is not before your dns dies, but in fact is dnsmasq being respawned. which would make sense, seeing that 21254 is quite a high number for the small number of processes running on a router.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I see the set of dnsmasq messages every few hours like I listed above. They always have the same PID so I don&#039;t think it is respawning. I see some pretty big PIDs probably due to stuff run via cron, e.g.:</p><p>root@batbox:~# ps ax<br />PID&nbsp; Uid&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;VmSize Stat Command<br />:<br />881 root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 392 S&nbsp; &nbsp;crond -c /etc/crontabs<br />22083 root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 420 S&nbsp; &nbsp;dropbear<br />22085 root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 536 R&nbsp; &nbsp;vi messages<br />21124 root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 648 S&nbsp; &nbsp;dropbear<br />21125 root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 544 S&nbsp; &nbsp;-ash<br />21254 nobody&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 440 S&nbsp; &nbsp;dnsmasq -l /tmp/dhcp.leases -K -F 192.168.1.3,192.168.1.254,255.255.255.0,12h -I vlan1<br />21263 root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 416 S&nbsp; &nbsp;vi messages<br />21613 root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 640 R&nbsp; &nbsp;dropbear<br />21614 root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 532 S&nbsp; &nbsp;-ash<br />21621 root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 384 R&nbsp; &nbsp;ps ax<br />root@batbox:~#</p>									</div>

					<p>well, i&#039;m having the same problem with dnsmasq now as well. I just plugged my laptop into my network and couldn&#039;t get an IP. set static, ssh&#039;d to my wrt, and ps -A | grep dns returned nothing (other than the grep dns command). my uptime is nowhere near 45 days though. This might be something worth looking into. In the meantime, i&#039;m going to make a script to throw into cron to check to see if dns is running, and if it isn&#039;t, start it.</p>									</div>

					<p>a script. I&#039;m throwing this into cron and setting it to run every thirty minutes. I think it should work. Use at your own risk, i&#039;ve had not formal programming/scripting training.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/etc/bin# cat servicecheck.sh

        logger &quot;dns has died, starting&quot;

					<p>You can replace &quot;ps aux | grep dns | grep masq&quot; with a much simpler &quot;pidof dnsmasq&quot;.</p><p>(I&#039;d still like to know why it failed so we can fix the problem and not just hide the symptoms.)</p>									</div>

					<p>thanks, pidof does seem to work just fine. i&#039;ll try to keep an eye on when it is failing and what events are around it and report back here. i&#039;m not really an expert on these things, so no promises.</p>									</div>
