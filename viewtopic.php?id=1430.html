					<p>Hi all,</p><p>1st post in the forum</p><p>A friend brought along his WRT54G-UK sometime last year as he wanted me to remove the TSOP and reflash to fix a bad upgrade. When i removed the flash i erased it to load up the new firmware, what my friend neglected to tell me was that it was an update he had and not a complete flash. So the router was knackered as we couldnt find a new flash (including the bootloader), so he went and bought a new router and left me with the broken one.<br />I now need a wireless network for my home to workshop and before i went and bought a new unit i thought id try and repair the old one. I have no knowledge of networking/routers or anything like that, i just do electronics repairs etc.<br />What id like if possible is a whole flash image (wholeflash.bin which includes the bootloader) for a v1.0 router (has pcmcia slot inside) that i can load up into my labprog+ programmer and flash the AMD Tsop via that method. The TSOP is completly blank and i have no idea about just flashing the boot sector and repairing from there, hence the reason i need a whole dump.<br />If i can get a flash ill will hand the unit over to my netwroking mate who will be able to adjust it for me for my use.</p><p>If anyone can help it would be much appreciated as it will save me buying a new router.</p><p>Thanx</p><p>Hami</p>									</div>
