					<p>I have gotten myself into a situation where I&#039;ve managed to disable both the lan and wifi on my Netgear N750 (not sure what version of OpenWRT).</p><p>I&#039;m able to give the device an IP over the Internet port and get pings back from it but neither SSH, telnet or Web give me a response for managing the device and turning services back on.</p><p>If I connect to a lan port TCP dump shows traffic leaving my machine but nothing coming in.</p><p>How can I recover this device?&nbsp; The Restore Factory Settings button doesn&#039;t seem to do anything.&nbsp; The power LED does not flash at all on boot.</p><p>Thanks for your assistance.</p>									</div>

About the same time the udp packet is expressed I get 3-5 pings back from 192.168.1.1. </p><p>I&#039;ve tried pressing all 3 physical buttons (simultaneously and individually) but none cause another udp packet to be sent or let me connect with telnet/ssh.</p>									</div>
