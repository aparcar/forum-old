					<p>I want to set up a bigger WLAN with devices which support OpenWRT. But therefore i need to know, if OpenWRT provides Handover. For example, I take two Linksys WRT54G and connect them by cabel. Then I gave them the same SSID and when a user logs in at one of them, he can switch to the other without lost of connection. Does OpenWRT support &quot;Extended Service Set&quot; or even IEEE 802.11f to do this?</p>									</div>

					<p>If two access points share the same ssid and encryption settings, the wireless driver on the client will automatically roam; it really has nothing to do with the AP.</p>									</div>

					<p>If the 2 AP&#039;s are in close proximity, you want them at least 5 channels apart to minimize interference.&nbsp; I use channels 1, 6, 11 in rotation to cover large buildings.&nbsp; It&#039;s been customary since the beginning of WiFi that you wire a building by using APs connected to a wired backbone LAN, with the same SSID and encryption settings.&nbsp; There are several good books on WiFi technology you can read.</p><p>One such book is located here:<br /><a href="http://www.wndw.net">http://www.wndw.net</a></p><p>Association behaviour is a function of the CLIENT software not the AP by the way.&nbsp; The AP just provides a bridge from wireless to wired.&nbsp; The common client software behaviour is it associates with an AP and stays with it until it loses signal, then a reassociation attempt is triggered.&nbsp; Some client sofware from Cisco is a bit smarter about it. The long-awaited 802.11r spec should enhance this behaviour considerably, but is not out yet.&nbsp; Bottom line, don&#039;t expect to roam a large area with a WiFi phone and have uninterrupted VoIP calls with current cheap client software.</p>									</div>

					<p>Using Kamikaze I can easily switch from one AP to another with WPA encoding, using WPA Supplicant (Webif automatizes Supplicant job call).<br />With WhiteRussian, I think that&#039;s the same if Nas is installed, I think I tried successfully once.<br />As vincentfox said, if you have all software you need, the association code is totally independent from encryption.</p>									</div>
