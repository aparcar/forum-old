					<p>If you read my <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=42635">post</a>, you will notice I tried to turn a Seagate DockStar into a router. The post did not seem to generate any response. However, I was able to get some helps over the #openwrt-devel channel on IRC from Paul Fertser to make it to work. Then, I gave my Seagate DockStar away to a friend. Unfortunately, now it doesn&#039;t work and I don&#039;t know why. I have a copy of the /etc/config/network file as shown below. When I put it back to my Seagate DockStar unit, it also no longer works. Again, I have no idea why.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;loopback&#039;

					<p>Hi Mazilo, thanks for the reply. Your post is not exactly what I want to achieve. I basically want to add an ethernet interface to my WR703n router via a USB (to ethernet convertor). I thought maybe someone had done this previously and could tell me which hardware is compatible with OpenWRT.....</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
