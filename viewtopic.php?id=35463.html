					<p>Look at these two tables:</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/802.11n#Data_rates">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/802.11n#Data_rates</a><br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/802.11n#Deployment_strategies">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/802.11n#D … strategies</a></p><p>20 Mhz is narrower than the old-fashioned 802.11g WLAN, 40MHz sits on two neighboring channels and can pump at higher data rates (see the table); but there&#039;s a higher chance of interfering or being interfered by other networks in the vicinity. Without noscan if it detects a network on a frequency you want to use, it refuses in an HT40 mode.&nbsp; Plus and minus designate that the secondary channel should be above or below the primary channel. Only certain combinations are possible (see the other table).</p><p>As for 802.11a, its spectrum is much less polluted with shit and other networks. If you have the option at all go for it. Reach is probably shorter but data rates will likely be higher.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>towolf</strong> on 13 Mar 2012, 18:17)</p>

					<p>I have the same router, and I would advise being careful about setting HT40 modes. I get a hard hang-up requiring failsafe recovery if I set an &quot;illegal&quot; HT40 mode (though I still don&#039;t know why ch44 HT40- is illegal). Here&#039;s my prior thread discussing this:</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=35369">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=35369</a></p><p>I&#039;m using r30556, so perhaps this issue has been fixed by now.</p><p>That said, I get around double the throughput, to around 300Mbps as reported by LuCI when I use HT40 modes in 5.4GHz. Sustained data transfers are giving me about 130Mbps.</p><p>However, in 2.4GHz I&#039;m not getting an increase in throughput when I set it to HT40+/-. I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s because I am in g/n mixed mode (because I have some g-only devices) and that prevents me from using the wider bandwidths. But, I am not sure.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi there,</p><p>Thanks for the quick reply.&nbsp; That is very informative information.&nbsp; </p><p>So why is the default from OpenWRT to use option &#039;htmode&#039; &#039;HT20&#039;?&nbsp; If HT40+ or - is faster, why wouldn&#039;t one of those be the default?&nbsp; Just want to make sure that I am not missing something.</p><p>On the question of whether or not to use the 2nd radio - if I turn on the 2nd radio, but don&#039;t care about 802.11a - can you still access 802.11n/b/g on that same radio?&nbsp; Or is the purpose only to expose 802.11a?&nbsp; I guess the question stems out of the naming of it from option &#039;hwmode&#039; &#039;11an&#039; ....</p><p>Thanks for humoring me.&nbsp; Just want to make sure I understand.</p>									</div>

					<p>No, you&#039;re not missing anything. I think I read somewhere that defaulting to 20MHz is an FCC requirement in the US. Another requirement is dropping back to 20MHz from 40MHz if the AP detects it will cause interference with another AP.</p><p>The second radio is for a/n at 5GHz only. If you don&#039;t want 5GHz then you can just shut it off.</p>									</div>

					<p>One more question - (this might be a really dumb one) - if I turn on both radios and run each with the same SSID, with they blend correctly?&nbsp; Will it help if some clients can run 5Ghz and some 2.4 Ghz?&nbsp; Could it improve performance if 1 client is running at 2.4 Ghz and one at 5 Ghz?&nbsp; Just curious if they operate like 2 Access Points would - potentially increasing speed by running both radios to different clients?</p><p>Thanks - I appreciate the help.</p>									</div>

Probably depending on signal strength.</p><br /><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Will it help if some clients can run 5Ghz and some 2.4 Ghz?&nbsp; Could it improve performance if 1 client is running at 2.4 Ghz and one at 5 Ghz?&nbsp; Just curious if they operate like 2 Access Points would - potentially increasing speed by running both radios to different clients?</p></blockquote></div><p>It’s absolutely true that having one client in one band and the other on a completely separate band will improve performance for both. If they are on the same band they have to take turns in transmitting. On two bands they are invisible to each other. The same effect could be achieved by having three APs on channels 1, 6, and 11 for the old-style channels, and 1, 5, 9, 13 for the narrower 20MHz channels. But since there’s so much crap going on on 2.4 GHz channels are all over the place. Cf.: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels#2.4.C2.A0GHz_.28802.11b.2Fg.2Fn.29">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_W … 2Fg.2Fn.29</a></p><p>The one problem with a shared ESSID is that some clients partout keep connecting to the AP they are not supposed to use. So the 11na capable client keeps connecting the 11g AP because its driver has some notion that the 11g AP is stronger (2.4GHz goes farther due to penetration properties of that wavelength). This is why I went to separate network names to make it explicit.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>towolf</strong> on 14 Mar 2012, 17:45)</p>
