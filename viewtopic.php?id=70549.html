					<p>Hello,</p><p>I would like to ask if anyone tried and/or managed to replace the original wifi card in Linksys WRT1900AC?<br />According to image below, it has 2 minipcie ports, however I am not sure if boot loader does not include some whitelist allowing only pre-installed card to work. What are your experiences? </p><p>Maybe some of you have a minipcie card and could test that?<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="https://content.hwigroup.net/images/products_xl/214507/6/linksys-wrt1900ac.jpg" alt="https://content.hwigroup.net/images/products_xl/214507/6/linksys-wrt1900ac.jpg" /></span></p><br /><p>According to <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=355982#p355982">this post</a> it seems to be possible on Mamba. I am already bored of waiting for proper wifi drivers from Marvel.</p><p>Second question if what 802.11b/g/n and 802.11ac/a/n cards to choose? I thought about Mikrotik R11E-2HPnD for 2.4GHz and R11e-5HacT for 5GHz. What is your opinion? Maybe you could recommend something else?</p>									</div>

					<p>I used the same cards from Mikrotik. However, the code changes are not trivial as they require multiple files to be edited.</p><p>nitroshift</p>									</div>

That&#039;s only one example of what needs to be changed. You&#039;d also need to change the config, the profile, etc. Unless you know your way around OpenWRT you won&#039;t find it easy to accomplish this.</p><p>nitroshift</p>									</div>

					<p>I know about config and profile.<br />Last question, if you already tried that and you managed to have those 2 cards running, maybe you could share some patch others from community could base on?</p>									</div>
