					<p>Hi,</p><p>Soon I&#039;m planning to change my ISP and change my internet speed to 120/10 Mb. Right now I&#039;m using SQM QoS on WR1043ND v1 (400Mhz, 32MB RAM) with 60/3 speeds. Now I&#039;m looking for a best way to enable SQM on 120/10 connection. My expected internet connection map will look something like that: ISP &gt; ISP cable modem/router &gt; OpenWRT powered device. I should probably mention that the ISP cable modem can work as a router or only as a modem device.</p><p>Those are my ideas so far on how to do it:<br />1. Buy a new router (obviously). But witch one?<br />2. Disable NAT on WR1043NDv1 to speed up WAN-to-LAN throughput and let the ISP cable modem (with router) to handle NAT. I&#039;m not sure though how much will I gain after doing this.<br />3. Disable SQM on download on WAN on WR1043NDv1. I tested this right now on my 60/3 connection and there is a little bufferbloat problem with higher pings when download hits the limit.</p><p>I&#039;m seeking for your opinions and possible ideas on how to handle it the best.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>iletujestkont2</strong> on 18 May 2016, 15:01)</p>

In all honesty I would first see how well your current router actually performs on the new &quot;plan&quot;.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>iletujestkont2 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>2.

It might well be that one of those will allow you to get a compromise between bandwidth and latency that you are comfortable with. That way you might be able to avoid having to buy a new router...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you buy a new router, you might want to consider an edgerouterX (<a href="https://www.ubnt.com/edgemax/edgerouter-x/">https://www.ubnt.com/edgemax/edgerouter-x/</a>) or apu2c (<a href="http://www.pcengines.ch/apu2c4.htm">http://www.pcengines.ch/apu2c4.htm</a>) and just use this as a fixed WAN to LAN shaper and DHCP server and then set up the old router as simple access point. Both of these should allow shaping 130Mbps combined, I am not sure how well they are supported in openwrt/lede at the moment though...</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>
