					<p>I&#039;m trying to set up AICCU on a newly-flashed kamikaze, and running in to trouble. I&#039;m not sure, but I think my problem is the same as the one described here: <a href="http://www.sixxs.net/forum/?msg=setup-539845">http://www.sixxs.net/forum/?msg=setup-539845</a> I can&#039;t detect any problems in the firewall, and I think I&#039;m getting the same packet length as that user, which is reportedly the problem.</p><p>So is anyone successfully using the pre-compiled AICCU on an AYIYA tunnel?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>P</p>									</div>
