					<p>Hello. I&#039;m experimenting a couple of WR850G (v1 &amp; v3) with openwrt-motorola-squashfs and openwrt-motorola-jffs2 and faced some trouble with experimental releases. I have flashed WRT54Gs before without problems</p><p>I renamed openwrt-motorola-squashfs.bin to trx and uploaded it through web firmware page (on R850G v1). Missed the boot_wait off on next reboot warning and the unit bricked (problably by the same cause of the second unit, plz read below)</p><p>decided to try the v3. this time enabled boot_wait and rebooted/tried to flash via tftp. the unit accepted it, answer pings but I cannot telnet to it. as boot_wait is on I can reflash with the other firmware file, but the behaviour is the same. boots up, I can ping it (192.168.10.1) but no telnet</p><p>as to debug this blindly is very difficult, I&#039;d appreciate any hints on experimental with WR850G. I&#039;ll try to debrick the v1 as soon as I can find the 3.3v pin on the 9 pin header -- in, out &amp; gnd are available on openwrt docs. I have a level shifter!!! :-)</p><p>the motorola default firmware turning boot_wait off on every reboot is a real pain. hopefully I&#039;ll have openwrt running on these beasts shortly to get rid of motorola&#039;s weird firmware.</p><p>Cheers<br />!3runo<br />from Brazil</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi there</p><p>just to let you know, my problem was timing. it seems to took a long time to firstboot complete its run on WR850G (longer than on WRT54G). After some time the units simply start working! I was able to install openwrt experimental on both units, using</p><p>- openwrt-motorola-squashfs.bin on v1, renaming the file to trx and using motorola web interface to upgrade</p><p>- openwrt-generic-jffs2-4MB.trx and openwrt-generic-squashfs.trx on v3, by boot_wait and tftping the files to the unit</p><p>I still could not find a 3.3v source on the unit to be able to use a level shifter. Let&#039;s see about that.</p><p>Cheers<br />!3runo<br />from Brazil</p><p>P.S. Wish to thanks frop from irc.freenode.net #wrt54g for his online hints on this install.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello everybody!<br />I&#039;m running openwrt experimental (cvs, 06.05.2005) on an Asus wl500g and I&#039;m experiencing random segmentation faults and other unexpected behaviour e.g.:</p><p>root@OpenWrt:~# ps -A<br />&nbsp; PID&nbsp; Uid&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;VmSize Stat Command<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 1 root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 384 S&nbsp; &nbsp;init<br />(...)<br />&nbsp; 436 root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 424 S &lt; /usr/sbin/pppoa3 -c -vpi 8 -vci 48<br />Illegal instruction</p><p>root@OpenWrt:~# ps -A<br />&nbsp; PID&nbsp; Uid&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;VmSize Stat Command<br />Segmentation fault</p><p>that didn&#039;t show up with the firmware I were previously using (Oleg&#039;s custom firmware 1.7.5.9-5). I don&#039;t know if (or how) this is related to the &quot;large file transfer reboot bug&quot;, but I trying different values from 108 to 128 for the clkfreq nvram variable didn&#039;t help (the wl500g is normally clocked at 125MHz). Any ideas on this issue?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, I have another problem, this time with Quagga. When I compile custom firmware with quagga included (e.g. zebra, ripd), only ripd is installed. I made another tests and it seems that only the last &quot;part&quot; of the quagga is installed into firmware - e.g. if you select ripd, bgpd and ospfd, only ospfd is installed. In file lists in /usr/somewhere all parts are listed correctly though. I suspect some Makefile bug but I have no time to fix it myself now.</p>									</div>

Seems like you checked out the &#039;TESTED&#039; revision, which doesn&#039;t have that fix yet. To fix this, you can either grab &#039;HEAD&#039; from CVS and build it or try my updated build at <a href="http://openwrt.inf.fh-brs.de/~nbd/gcc34/">http://openwrt.inf.fh-brs.de/~nbd/gcc34/</a> if you don&#039;t want to compile everything again.</p>									</div>
