					<p>I never stated I have an ACS/v2, only a AC/v2. It is a late model referb.&nbsp; What I get with late firmware is complete lockout when country and or gain has been set. I have had country alone work and give different gain selections. But once I mode the gain and set, perminent disconnection.</p><p>To lock it, i had to remove stock setting both in interface for lan attached to wifi, and remove attached to lan on wifi settings, as they do not link together in luci. If i change from wifi first, lan still sees wifi as linked and will not remove it when set. It is like permanently locked and won&#039;t allow wifi to reconnect&nbsp; even if you link via wifi.</p><p>I thought luci had issues because of the strange setting problems.</p><p>Maybe he latest ac/v2 has been updated like the other /v2 models and will not allow any changes to gain table and country codes.</p><p>To lock the gain I must juggle around between 2.4 and 5 in wifi settings, disabling and setting changes to country, and changing gain and Re enabling. Removing links in net and Re establishing link to wifi devices. A time consuming random act to get gains to stick around 25 to 30 db. The only problem I have is none of it helps with 2.4 band, even though i can pump 750 ma or more, the congestion is limited to 54 mbps,&nbsp; when I need 72 mbps.&nbsp; 5Ghz properly gives 150mbps and 300mbps. So that is why I am keeping Linksys firmware. Maybe there is a setting to make 2.4 Ghz link at a 72 mbps connection,&nbsp; it is just i never have seen it in any of David&#039;s builds for my device.</p>									</div>

					<p>For DNSCrypt-Proxy --</p><p>Reading this from the build source packages.</p><br /><br /><p>## Status of the project</p><p>This project was taken offline by its creator and maintainer Frank Denis on the 6th December 2018, after announcing in November 2017 that [the project needs a new maintainer](<a href="https://twitter.com/jedisct1/status/928942292202860544">https://twitter.com/jedisct1/status/928942292202860544</a>).</p><p>The old webpage [dnscrypt.org]() now points to a new domain, endorsing the usage of competing protocol &quot;DNS-over-TLS&quot; and competing software in particular the &quot;getdns&quot; library and an immature implementation that could substitute dnscrypt-proxy, called &quot;stubby&quot;.</p><p>The new website also links a [critical analysis of DNSCrypt vs DNS-over-TLS protocols](<a href="https://tenta.com/blog/post/2017/12/dns-over-tls-vs-dnscrypt">https://tenta.com/blog/post/2017/12/dns … s-dnscrypt</a>) by a company marketing their own open-source Android web browser and offering a new DNS resolver implemented in Go.</p><p>While this sounds all very new and exciting to us, at Dyne.org we already rely on DNSCrypt-proxy for our project [Dowse.eu]() and are intentioned to maintain this software unless a viable and mature alternative arises, supporting our application of it in Dowse.</p><p>We intend to maintain the DNSCrypt-proxy codebase without the intention of adding any new features, just patch bugs. We are also available to archive older versions and setup the website and the wiki, if we are given these archives. Frank Denis: if you are reading this please contact us on info@dyne.org. It won&#039;t take long and we are happy to keep your project alive, many thanks for all the fish so far!</p><p>Anyone running a DNSCrypt server, interested in the future of this software, willing to share more insights or wanting to help with development and documentation: be welcome to [join our dnscrypt mailinglist](<a href="https://mailinglists.dyne.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/dnscrypt">https://mailinglists.dyne.org/cgi-bin/m … o/dnscrypt</a>) where we are setting up a campfire for all of us to make a sustainable plan and take collectively informed decisions.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davidc502</strong> on 3 Apr 2018, 01:21)</p>
