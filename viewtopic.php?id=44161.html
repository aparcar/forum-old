					<p>Hi i have bricked TL-WR740N v4.23 (only power led is on after connecting power cord). According to this page:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr740n#uart.on.v4.23">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl- … t.on.v4.23</a></p><p>I need to solder serial cable yes? But i really need to use USB to UART TTL converter? Or maybe i can use standard USB cable <strong>or</strong> eg COM Cable? (eg SE COM cable <a href="http://pinouts.ru/CellularPhones-P-W/erics_t28_pinout.shtml">http://pinouts.ru/CellularPhones-P-W/er … nout.shtml</a> [pins 4,5,10,11]).</p><p>Cheers</p>									</div>

Configure your PC with a static IP address: 192.168.1.2
Plug the power on to the router.
Wait until the &quot;SYS&quot; LED starts flashing repeatedly.
Press the &quot;QSS&quot; button (on the front/back of the router) → the &quot;SYS&quot; LED will now start flashing at a faster rate.
Login to the router by using telnet to connect to the IP address 192.168.1.1 → there will be an immediate unauthenticated login to a root shell.</code></pre></div>									</div>

					<p>NO. You have to confirm that the cable Tx/Rx are providing/accepting 3V3. There must be a data sheet somewhere. If they are, then you only need connect Tx, Rx and GND. If they work on higher voltage you might fry the serial lines.<br />DO NOT connect Vcc (any) to the router.</p>									</div>

					<p>you never have to connect VCC at all.</p><p>the router must have its own ac adapter and that is the only psu it needs.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nebbia88</strong> on 1 Nov 2013, 15:50)</p>
