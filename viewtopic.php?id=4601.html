					<p>Hi!</p><p>I&#039;m located on a student network but I have a public IP adress. On my openwrt server I can ping the host &quot;wiki&quot; which is a computer on the student network. But on my clients withing my own network I can not ping these hosts... All the other internet sites I get an ip resolve for though. So it justs the hostnames on the student network I can not access.</p><p>What could be causing this?</p><p>I guess I could do like here: <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=4079">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=4079</a></p><p>But then I would have to hardcode the DNS servers which I get dynamicly via the DHCP server....</p><p>Ideas?</p>									</div>
