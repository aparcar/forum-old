					<p>Any OpenWrt supported router with an USB port can theoretically be used in conjunction with USB 3g modems, however in practise there are often hardware issues due to USB power limits which might lead to instable connections. In many cases it helps to use an externally powered USB hub but this might not be an option for a pure mobile scenario.</p><p>Also all OpenWrt supported Atheros routers can do simulateneous AP + Client (&quot;Repeater&quot;) mode.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the response.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing if you had bandwidth to work on adding the TP-Link Tl Mr3020 you would have said so? :-)</p><p>Anyone interested?&nbsp; I&#039;m in Brazil, so I don&#039;t have many choices regarding what I can buy that is already supported.&nbsp; But these are only USD$45 each so I&#039;d be happy to send one out to anyone willing to take on the work.</p><p>Best,</p><p> -Eric</p>									</div>
