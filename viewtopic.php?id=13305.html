					<p>Good evening, my question consists in following:<br />I have downloaded Kamikaze&nbsp; 7.0.9and Webif2.<br />i have small static network where i want to establish class based QoS.<br />So i want to implement DiffServ approach where the concept is in following:<br />I have to have&nbsp; 6 different queues for the router like <br />EF, BE, AF1, AF2, AF3, AF4.<br />EF has DSCP 46<br />BE has DSCP 0<br />in each of AF i have to have 3 DSCP marks in accordance to dropping priority.<br />in total it comes out 14DSCP marks.<br />Im not interested in avgrate, or whatever...my main interest is that this router has to classify the packets <br />in accordance to the some access list that i ll specify and process the traffic in the separate queues in accordance to the DSCP field.<br />In case of congestion i want Random early detection to discard the packets with high dropping priority.<br />I was setting this policy on the Cisco router, but now i want to do the same on the Linksys.<br />I have read the documentation and FAQ, but still i didnt find something similar...<br />Can somebody provide simple guideline or point the link where i can get this information?<br />Im familiar with QoS config script and gui so&nbsp; any suggestions are warmly welcome</p><p>Thanks for attention<br />Lene</p>									</div>
