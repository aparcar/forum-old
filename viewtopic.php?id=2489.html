					<p>Sorry this is probably a far too basic question, but please help me get started.</p><p>I have configured and built my src tree and image files are created.&nbsp; Now I decide I want to change a few things and go into the linux kernel src and edit some code.&nbsp; Hitting make in the top level dir does not recompile the kernel tree though?&nbsp; How do I trigger it to recompile?&nbsp; Related question if I simply go into the kernel tree dir and hit make, will it use all the correct cross compiler stuff, or do I need to setup something in order for this to work?</p><p>Sorry, for the basic questions.&nbsp; Grateful for any pointers though</p>									</div>
