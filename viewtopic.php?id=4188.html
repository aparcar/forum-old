					<p>I have the svn image of whiterussian and can build it and use the image ok. All I want to do is modify a c file in dropbear (to allow external connections to a forwarded port, not just from localhost). Is there a make target from the top level that will rebuild the dropbear package? When I run just &quot;make&quot; or &quot;make dropbear&quot; I never see anything compile in the dropbear area. What is the correct way to do this?</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, figured it out myself, it think. Looks like you have to add the approrpriate patch file for the change you want into openwrt/package/dropbear/patches and remove the package and the expanded/patched source directory, e.g., <br />cd openwrt<br />rm openwrt/packages/dropbear*<br />rm -rf openwrt/build_mipsel/dropbear*<br />make<br />Now have new/improved dropbear pkg, and rebuilt images as a side-effect.<br />Possibly the SDK provides a better way to just modify a package?</p>									</div>
