					<p>Besides taking your chance on unreliable washers and unclean dryers...</p><p>Ignore the WAN functionality. Your device won&#039;t do any routing unless it is asked to do so, by virtual of being specified as the default gateway for some devices. The DHCP servers on both devices should be set to issue the LAN address of the DSL router as the gateway. So the bridge on the non-DSL connected device will be between LAN and wireless LAN only; WAN port(s) disconnected.</p>									</div>

					<p>Update:</p><p>I decided to try to configure it within Luci. I basically just bridged all the interfaces: eth0, eth1, wan0 and @wan. And ... well ... it works. It&#039;s functioning nicely as a DHCP server/Access point right now. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I&#039;m wondering though, is there a disadvantage to not using the VLAN switch if I only use 1 network? I couldn&#039;t see what I could gain from it so I disabled the VLAN functionality.</p><br /><p>Ive also been thinking, what if the fiber router is having issues? (my initial concern)<br />OpenWrt&#039;s DHCP server tells clients that the default gateway is 192.168.1.1, but what if it&#039;s down? Would I still have a local network connection?</p><br /><p>Here&#039;s my config files right now, please take a quick look and see if everything is OK like this.</p><p>/etc/config/network<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;loopback&#039;
