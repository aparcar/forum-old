					<p>Currently running OpenWrt Backfire 10.03.1-rc5 on Linksys WRT54G ver 1.1, but I want to sell this device and get a different hardware so I need to take it back to the bog standard Linksys firmware.</p><p>Downloaded the latest from Linksys/Cisco and first tried to use the upgrade option from the web interface.&nbsp; After the reboot I have a device that there is no IP address that I can get to.</p><p>Recover the device using the TFTP method pushing the 10.03 firmware back up to the device on its boot up.</p><p>Next I tried scp over the linksys firmware to the /tmp directory and then using MTD to write the Linksys firmware and again I am left with a device with no IP address.</p><p>This time I just try to use the TFTP method and push the Linksys firmware to the device but still can&#039;t get a working device.</p><p>At this point I am back to 10.03 but still need to get this rolled back to Linksys so I can sell this thing.</p><p>What have I done wrong?</p>									</div>
