					<p>Hi all - </p><p>I&#039;ve poked around a bit - but I haven&#039;t been able to find a solid answer for this. </p><p>Is there a way to provide a custom DNS server to DHCP clients in OpenWRT? </p><p>My use case is I have my OpenWRT box auto connecting to an OpenVPN server - and I&#039;d love for my DHCP client to use the DNS server on the other side of the VPN. </p><p>I&#039;d setup forwarding - but I&#039;m concerned the OpenWRT box won&#039;t be able to resolve the VPN server since they&#039;re using the same domain (which, on the lan, will resolve to the local IP of the VPN server instead of the external IP). </p><p>Cheers - </p><p>ScriptGiddy</p>									</div>
