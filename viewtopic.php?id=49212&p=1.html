					<p>Hi,</p><p>I recently purchased a D-Link DCS-930L and a D-Link DCS-932L IP camera and found out that there is an OpenWrt image for the DCS-930 available. However, I couldn&#039;t find any documentation or any post regarding this camera and didn&#039;t succeed in uploading the factory image via the web interface.</p><p>Does anybody know if there are any differences between the DCS-930 and the DCS-930L? <br />What steps do I have to take to install OpenWrt on my camera? I disassembled mine in the hope of a serial console, but couldn&#039;t find any marked pins, just some solder pads.</p><p>Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mauritzius</strong> on 25 Feb 2014, 21:37)</p>

					<p>I wondered about the same.</p><p>My 932 has one ethernet port, so in theory it might maybe be used as a lan-to-wifi repeater, but I really wonder if any camera functionality would be left. And what would then be the point, as much cheaper repeaters can be found.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi from a Noob to OpenWrt, and nice work to Mauritzius on this project! </p><p>My question is whether the DCS 930/932 camera with OpenWrt would be able to wirelessly connect (bridge or client mode??) to an existing WAN connected wifi router, and have the DCS camera&#039;s Ethernet port connected to another device (an Arduino with Ethernet board) to access the internet through the wifi bridge to the WAN connected router so that both the camera and the Arduino could be accessed from the internet (port forwarded)?</p><p>Please keep explanation not too technicalâ€¦ I&#039;ve not yet used OpenWrt, and have only a little experience with web accessing my arduino so far through no-ip.com redirect to a simple test HTML page.</p><p>I am trying to decide whether the DCS 930/932 could do what the TP-Link WRT703 has been able to do to connect MCU to internet for projects, but with the added benefit of a camera to monitor your project in a web browser. </p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>lat50, it should be able to do exactly the same things as the WRT703, as long as you don&#039;t run out of space on the flash.<br />An alternative would be to get a cheap webcam and connect that to the USB port of the WRT703, which is pretty much what the dcs930l does internally. I noticed too late that the included camera is rather low quality, which makes it rather more expensive than combination, but it does have a nicer form factor with the camera included.</p>									</div>

					<p>It should be the squashfs one that you should use, that one has the exactly same size as the standard firmware. Trying one of the others probably just wont work. If it fails it&#039;s indeed possible to revert back to the original firmware, look at the D-Link support site for it and flash it the same way. I&#039;ve done that a couple of time on an A09 DCS-930L and also on a A03 DCS-930 as neither would work after i flashed OpenWrt :(</p><p>Is anyone having any luck flashing any of the cameras mentioned above? I&#039;ve tried both a couple of different snapshot versions and also the official Barrier Breaker one and even some of the older RC&#039;s, without any luck. No complaints from the emergency interface when flashing, but the red LED on the front never changes colour, feels like the flash process fails somehow. Powercycling the camera does not help, I&#039;ve tried tcpdump&#039;ing and looking for any signs of it being alive after flashing but without any luck. For the record the older DCS-930 (not the 930L then) fails in the exactly same way. Is there any way one can trigger the TFTP upload without having to open the case and get a serial console?</p>									</div>

					<p>I tried to install OpenWRT 14.07 on my DCS-933L (rev.A) last night, through the dlink recovery-mode as advised on the wiki and the camera wouldn&#039;t boot. I ended up putting the dlink firmware back on it and left it for the night.</p><p>I was under the impression that flashing through the recovery-mode was working is there anything im doing wrong, I don&#039;t feel too comfortable about opening it up and getting a serial connection but is that the only way?!</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, so I just checked what I have here:</p><p>DCS-930L, H/W A2, FW: 1.08<br />DCS-932L, H/W A1, FW: 1.08</p><p>I&#039;m running on both of them a self-compiled OpenWrt Barrier Breaker r39854 image. I attached serial console, but I think I only ever flashed via the instructions I posted earlier on (Emergency Web Interface).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mauritzius</strong> on 13 Apr 2015, 19:48)</p>
