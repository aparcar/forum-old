					<p>I have two scripts that I&#039;ve been working on ready for some feedback if anyone is interested.&nbsp; </p><p>The first is called <a href="https://github.com/robzr/bearDropper">bearDropper</a>, and is essentially a minimal, lightweight dropbear (ssh) log examiner that blocks ssh brute force attacks.&nbsp; It hooks itself into iptables, is very configurable using uci and/or command line options.&nbsp; The goal was to make it simple to use but very reliable and configurable - let me know if you think I succeeded.&nbsp; It started as a rewrite of dropBrute, but has many other features:<br /></p><ul><li><p>Written in busybox ash with no dependencies outside of stock Chaos Calmer</p></li><li><p>Maintains a state database, periodically writes it to tmpfs and (optionally) persistent storage</p></li><li><p>Persistent storage writes are throttled (default once a day) and are disabled by default</p></li><li><p>Periodically syncs the state database to a dedicated iptables chain</p></li><li><p>Periodically expires entries from the iptables chain</p></li><li><p>Self installs into iptables (default hook is into input_wan_rule) - easily disabled or modified in config</p></li><li><p>Uses native uci config, and runs via a procd init script (continuous run)</p></li><li><p>For those who like options, it can also run in a few single-run (non-continuous) modes, examining the entire syslog ring buffer, just today&#039;s entries (like dropBrute), or even arbitrary intervals.</p></li></ul><p>The second is called <a href="https://github.com/robzr/sub2rbl">sub2rbl</a>, and it&#039;s a very simple, lightweight script to retrieve RBLs, compile them into an ipset and automatically hook into iptables with a firewall rule (default in input_wan_rule).&nbsp; It also uses uci (/etc/config/sub2rbl), with command line overrides.&nbsp; Dependencies are ipset, curl and openssl-util (to retrieve RBLs via https).<br /></p><ul><li><p>Supports IP based and CIDR (net) based RBLs</p></li><li><p>Default config uses OpenBL, blocklist.de, Dragon Research and SpamHaus DROP/EDROP RBLs</p></li><li><p>Whitelist support based on a uci config list (see config file for details)</p></li><li><p>Simple installation, see the github project page for instructions</p></li></ul><p>I&#039;m looking forward to hearing some feedback (and bug reports) <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Rob</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>robzr</strong> on 19 Jan 2016, 00:13)</p>

					<p>I did a bit of work on sub2rbl - it now includes support for net based RBLs, and the config file includes a couple - the SpamHaus DROP &amp; EDROP RBLs, which are composed of IP ranges hijacked/used by spammers and cyber-criminals.&nbsp; To keep it memory efficient, sub2rbl will now add a hash:net based ipset if the net-based RBLs are used in addition to the standard hash:ip set.&nbsp; They could all go into a single hash:net set, but they use a bit more memory than the hash:ip sets, so I think it was worth a little extra logic to implement this way.</p><p>Rob</p>									</div>

					<p>I haven&#039;t experienced this, but it may be a known issue with newer curl builds on OpenWRT: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/19621">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/19621</a></p><p>From what it looks like to me, curl (or rather the mbedTLS library, formerly known as PolarSSL) is not recognizing the root cert bundle and/or directory.&nbsp; The ca-certificates package loads a directory with root certs and then generates hash links to the cert files.&nbsp; The other method that people seem to use is to install a single cert bundle (one file with all the certs concatenated), which is what the <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem">http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem</a> file is.&nbsp; The compiled in options in curl/mbedTLS should read at least the directory (maybe the file too).&nbsp; Try this: &quot;curl --cafile /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt <a href="https://lists.blocklist.de/lists/ssh.txt\">https://lists.blocklist.de/lists/ssh.txt&quot;</a></p><p>If that still fails, try uninstalling the ca-certificates bundle; make sure that the only file in /etc/ssl/certs is ca-certificates.crt (the bundle), and then try it again.&nbsp; Depending on the precedence that mbedTLS loads the cert files/bundles with, you might have a conflict there.</p><p>As a final band-aid you can also try &quot;curl --insecure <a href="https://lists.blocklist.de/lists/ssh.txt\">https://lists.blocklist.de/lists/ssh.txt&quot;</a> and see if that lets you sidestep the cert issue until this gets fixed.</p><p>Rob</p>									</div>
