					<p>&lt;background&gt;<br />I&#039;d like to share with you my project, called &quot;clock140 - a clock for Twitter and Time&quot;</p><p>I&#039;m happy to say that I&#039;ve built a functional prototype; its based on OpenWrt and its really great. You can see it here:<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJeMCL3XZeY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJeMCL3XZeY</a></p><p>The prototype was developed using the Arduino Yun, which uses a combination of Atmel MCU and Atheros 9331 based OpenWrt fork. As a wifi connected alarm clock, using OpenWrt is perfect because of its out-of-the-box connectivity. The clock can be fully configured (including alarms and access to web services) using simply a browser... Its really neat, and I love using it.</p><p>My next step in this project its to research lower cost implementations. One interesting platform is the OOLITE board based again on OpenWrt. As such, I&#039;ve procured a development board from Alibabba and currently its collecting dust in my closet <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>&lt;QUESTIONS&gt;<br />My main issue is, **how do I drive the LCD using SPI on the Oolite device**? The data sheet states that there is an SPI interface, however, I&#039;m not really sure how to test it. </p><p>Also note that on the Arduino prototype, I&#039;m using the library u8glib, which makes driving the LCD quite easy:<br /><a href="https://code.google.com/p/u8glib/">https://code.google.com/p/u8glib/</a></p><p>I would probably need to port this to Oolite (OpenWrt) which I believe is doable, however, I really have no idea where to begin.</p><p>Any tips or suggestions would be tremendously helpful. Or if you have general advice or comments...well I&#039;ll take that too <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />This was a long post, so thanks for reading!</p><p>tl;dr - how to port u8glib to OpenWrt (oolite) or in general connect LCDs to OpenWrt?</p>									</div>
