					<p>It isn&#039;t supposed to create one, since its in client mode. To &quot;repeat&quot; a network in a WDS setting you have to declare a 2nd wifi-iface in ap mode.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, thanks. I missed that. Now it creates the network. But I&#039;m not sure the routers are really connected. If I ping from one router to the other they are supposed to reply true? Well I will keep trying.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>I managed to create the WDS link, but I&#039;m not able to create the other AP. I&#039;m using psk2 encryption for the connection between routers&nbsp; but I read somewhere that WDS is only working with static encryption like WEP? (in my case if I use WEP doesn&#039;t seem to work) anyway, when I try to create to other AP declaring a second wifi-iface in ap mode the WDS stop working and the router doesn&#039;t create any network.
