					<p>Hi, I&#039;m trying to use bird4 to get OSPF routing on Chaos Calmer.</p><p>I can see there are some guidelines on /etc/bird4.conf, but since there is UCI support for bird I think it would be better to go with it. However, I&#039;m getting a hard time trying to get any bird4 OSPF UCI conf example to use as start point.</p><p>Or should I get bird4-uci out of that?</p><p>Could somebody give any pointer?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>I tried getting this going (with IPv6) about a year ago, and couldn&#039;t get bird to import the routes into the RIB.

					<p>Thank you for your answer.</p><p>It does seem that bird4-uci does support BGP, but doesn&#039;t support OSPF, since I have found this thread dated from November 2014 (sorry but the system does not allow me make links)</p><p>[OpenWrt-Users] luci-app-bird4 fails since bird4 UCI doesn&#039;t support &quot;ospf&quot; config directives</p><p>Where it is said that OSPF lines where added to /etc/config/bird4 before they were supported. There is a commit on github.com/openwrt-routing/packages/commit/40405d022b029186fb862a09789a6c0cf2f224a3 where OSPF lines are simply removed from /etc/config/bird4.</p><p>There is another thread, where developer of bird4-uci says he&#039;s putting his efforts on BGP routing, nothing about OSPF, search for &quot;Bring UCI and LUCI configuration for Bird4/6 to improve integration with OpenWRT&quot;</p><p>So, short answer seems to be &quot;get bird4-uci out if you want to do OSPF with bird in OpenWRT&quot;</p><p>Could somebody confirm that?</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, it seems it is doing something now. Still nothing useful, I think I need to play much more with config, but at least now it has neighbors... so I think it&#039;s worth to say it here, because I see there is were little info about that, at least that I would be able to reach.</p><p>Those neighbors are Mikrotik routers with RouterOS 6.40, they are the dr and the bdr. Somewhere I have read that there are problems with mikrotik routers since each one (mikrotik and openwrt) thinks the other one is the dr, and that type should be changed from broadcast to ptp for they to work together.&nbsp; I did not that, but seems it is working because dr and bdr have been already elected before starting bird4 in openwrt.</p><p>Got bird4-uci out, then rebuild, then changed /etc/bird4.conf to</p><p>protocol ospf {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; import all;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; export all;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; export where source = RTS_STATIC;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; area 0 {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; interface &quot;eth1&quot; {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cost 10;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hello 10;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; retransmit 5;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wait 40;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dead 40;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; type broadcast;<br />#&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;authentication simple;<br />#&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;password &quot;pass&quot;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; };<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; };<br />}</p><p>The important thing seems to be changing hello time. Only backbone area. I&#039;ll continue to play with it... But if somebody has some hint about how to make they exchange routes, I would take it.</p><p>Cheers</p>									</div>
