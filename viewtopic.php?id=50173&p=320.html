					<p>By the way... RC2 was very similar to CC final in one way. Where I saw similarities was with the CPU interrupts (affinity) - RC2 and Final are very heavy on the Interrupts with CPU0. This is in stark contrast to RC3 which is much more balanced between core0 and 1. Since the lock-ups are caused by CPU spinocks it seems logical that affinity plays a part in the problem. Some people are having success with CC Final by separating the interrupts for Wifi, thus interrupting both CPU&#039;s, and helping to avoid spinlocks.</p><p>I&#039;ve read arguments on both sides of the issue.... One particular person is emphatic that all the interrupts should go to 1 processor because it&#039;s more efficient. I would have to say that testing shows RC2 and Final to have slightly more performance, and perhaps that&#039;s due to 1 core being driven instead of two.</p><p>Bottom line for me is that I&#039;ll take slightly less performance for something that&#039;s stable.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davidc502</strong> on 5 Oct 2015, 02:36)</p>
