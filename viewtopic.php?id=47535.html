					<p>I&#039;m not sure whether it will work for your model, but I built a custom image for my WRT54GL and the final size of the firmware was 2117 KB. And as far as I know, there were still some redundant packages in it that I didn&#039;t remove, but kept for comfort purposes.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your reply, but I was hoping for some how that I can implement the method of installing open wet in TL-WR542g by using a firmware image like vxKiller ?<br />What about other firmware, maybe there&#039;s some kind of LITE firmware for this kind of devices !</p>									</div>

But it isn&#039;t simple, also i&#039;m not convinced it will run smoothly because of the ram limitation as well</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>FriedZombie</strong> on 26 Nov 2013, 12:26)</p>
