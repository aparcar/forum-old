					<p>Hi,</p><p>Here is my current setup: I have a wrt54g attached to a 3com switch, two ports of the 3com switch are connected to two distinct aironet 1100 AP&#039;s.</p><p>I want to use this setup as a captive portal. Presently, I have chillispot running on a wired port of the linksys router. It seems to work if i connect a pc to the wired port ( i have to authenticate, etc...). However, if i plug the switch or the the AP dircetly to that wired port of the router, everything seems to break down. Chilli shows a message dealing with spoofed packet. </p><p>I have googled, and it seems DHCP relay is needed to avoid this kind of problem. Unfortunatel, the AP&#039;s I have do not support dhcp relay. I cannot find any information about such thing and my switch (3com 4400 SE).</p><p>Any hints?</p>									</div>
