					<p>I had the same problem when changing IP addresses by hand (to 10.60.x.x/28 addresses) - I also found the WRT was sending arp requests for IPs it should not.</p><p>After setting the correct IPs in the nvram it all worked fine, so I assumed the boot scripts did something different, but I just checked and they run /sbin/ifup which calls ifconfig, so I don&#039;t know what the problem is either.</p><p>I have been playing with admcfg and there is an arp related bug <a href="http://www.openwrt.org/Bugs#head-d608ef2b2b29d832f112302d487742dc7991b59e"> here </a><br />although what is described there is different from what you and I are seeing.</p><p> - Matt</p>									</div>
