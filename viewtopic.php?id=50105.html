					<p>On my router running OpenWRT 12.09 stable, both /etc/dropbear/dropbear_dss_host_key and /etc/dropbear/dropbear_rsa_host_key have timestamps of Sep 8 2011. That suggests to me these private keys are not generated upon a device install, or with first run of Dropbear, and are presumably shared by thousands of OpenWRT installs. Isn&#039;t this a major security issue?</p><p>EDIT: I should add, I know how to regenerate fresh keys (using dropbearkey), but a lot of people won&#039;t think to do that. From what I understand, most big distros generate these keys during install.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gorbachev</strong> on 15 Apr 2014, 19:26)</p>

					<p>They are generated during first boot. The reason for the timestamps is that the router time is initially set to build time, before the time is updated with ntp.</p>									</div>

					<p>It might be interesting to take a survey of the dropbear host keys.&nbsp; If the keys are generated before much entropy is collected, they may be mostly the same anyway.&nbsp; ;-)</p>									</div>

					<p>They are probably based on the time of your firstboot, so they will be pretty different. Unless somene knows the exact time when you did firstboot, you should be fine <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t know how random number generator exactly works, and you may have a point, but you get always a different key after firstboot and passwd, even on an offline router, you can try it. Putty complains about not matching key. How much different they are I have no idea.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 18 Apr 2014, 00:17)</p>

					<p>You can verify that the keys are always different even on a single router:<br />1. firstboot<br />2. reboot<br />3. telnet to router, run passwd and pick your password<br />4. ssh to router using putty and putty will ask if you want to store a key</p><p>Now do the above once again, but on step 4 you will see, that putty will warn, that the key fingerprint does not match with the one stored from previous installation.</p>									</div>

					<p>thanks for understanding :-)<br />my concern was that these two keys were some sort of master keys on which ssh keys were later generated&nbsp; ... or as you said they do not differ much. <br />person with two routers might be able to invoke firstboot/telnet/reboot sequence in same time on both, maybe not very usable vulnerability but would be interesting to see result</p>									</div>
