					<p>Doesn&#039;t seem to be a lot of activity for the Linksys E2100L but thought I would throw in my success story.&nbsp; I&#039;m currently using Firmware Version OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment r33174 / LuCI Trunk (trunk+svn8893) that I compiled a little over two weeks ago.&nbsp; Its currently going on a little over 9 days up time with no noted problems.&nbsp; I installed ntfs-3g to enable read/write to 2TB NTFS drive.&nbsp; Also have MiniDLNA installed and partially running.&nbsp; I say partially because it won&#039;t index or show files with the MPG extension.&nbsp; It did index all of the AVI files (a little over 300) and the few I tested streamed flawlessly.&nbsp; Since I already have a good streaming system running PS3 Media Server on an older Dell Optiplex with WinXP I dropped the MiniDLNA idea and disabled it on the router.&nbsp; Disk write performance was slow, about 1Mb/s compared to over 11Mb/s when writing to the same disk attached to the Optiplex.&nbsp; Not sure if the problem is the USB piece SAMBA, or the ntfs-g3 module.&nbsp; My best guess is the ntfs-g3 module.&nbsp; I compiled the firmware on Ubuntu 12.04 running in a VirtualBox on a Vista64 PC.&nbsp; I compiled using the instructions found in the Wiki and the two changes found in this thread (NL16 to NL1X).&nbsp; After compiling and running on the router I was able to change the Router Model to Linksys E2100L as displayed on the status page.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t reboot the router after doing so but I&#039;m pretty sure it will stick.&nbsp; Just got tired of seeing WRT160NL displayed.&nbsp; I did that by changing /tmp/sysinfo/model.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done a few more updated compiles but am reluctant to update the firmware since everything is working so good as is.&nbsp; I have already soft bricked the router 3 times and was able to recover without the use of a JTAG or serial cable.&nbsp; Don&#039;t want to push my luck!&nbsp; I actually ordered a serial cable the last time it bricked because I thought I wasn&#039;t going to recover.&nbsp; Within a hour after placing the order I was able to recover again using the failsafe boot.&nbsp; I&#039;m nowhere near being a Linux guru but by following the instructions carefully was able to successfully compile, install and configure the E2100L to the point where I want it.&nbsp; I do wish I had a second one just so I could play and experiment more.&nbsp; I&#039;ll just have to keep checking the garage sales!</p>									</div>

					<p>I just finished a new build this afternoon that I plan to test this evening (r33311).&nbsp; The build I&#039;m using now doesn&#039;t include some of the extra&#039;s I mentioned previously.&nbsp; I added them later using the package installer in Luci.&nbsp; The new build has everything included.&nbsp; If it loads successfully and seems OK I&#039;ll find a place to put them for download.&nbsp; As a side note, changing the /tmp/sysinfo/model to E2100L is not permanent.&nbsp; I guess the fact that it is in the tmp directory should have been a clue.&nbsp; Still trying to figure out where to change it in the source so it gets compiled in the right place.&nbsp; The problem, for me anyway, is that even the stock firmware for the E2100L contains lots of references to the WRT160NL.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to change something that causes a catastrophic failure!</p><p>Jim&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Edit:&nbsp; Sorry to say I did it, bricked my router big time.&nbsp; The good news is the Nokia CA-42 cable I bought before and needed now worked and I was able to recover.&nbsp; So I&#039;m back at it again.&nbsp; If I come up with something that seems like a safe install I let you now.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jimfree</strong> on 1 Sep 2012, 05:52)</p>

					<p>For wintoon or anyone else who is interested I have shared my build of OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment r33174/LuCI Trunk (trunk+svn8893) at <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?4o42mc4zafxny">http://www.mediafire.com/?4o42mc4zafxny</a>.&nbsp; I was trying to build an all inclusive bin that would include minidlna but for whatever reason, no matter what I did, it came out too large.&nbsp; With this build I was able to install ntfs-3g, minidlna and luci-app-minidlna using the luci interface and still have room left over.&nbsp; For the life of me I cannot figure out why I couldn&#039;t to a complete compile with the later trunk versions.&nbsp; You don&#039;t need the ntfs-3g if you don&#039;t plan on writing to a NTFS drive plugged into the USB port.&nbsp; Likewise, you don&#039;t need to install minidlna unles you want to try it out. </p><p>It has been stable on my router.&nbsp; It was up and running for over a week until I started trying recompile and install new trunk releases to include minidlna.&nbsp; I&#039;ve installed it from the stock firmware update web interface and from the luci web interface with no problems.&nbsp; With all the experimental builds I&#039;ve become pretty adept at using the serial console to recover from bricked situations <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p><p>Jim</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, I&#039;ve got it where I like it using OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment r33324/LuCI Trunk (trunk+svn9236).&nbsp; the bin is pretty much the same as the r33174 that I posted earlier.&nbsp; SAMBA and NTFS read/write are included in this build.&nbsp; I still could not include MiniDLNA in the build as it kept getting too big.&nbsp; It can be easily installed using the Luci package installer if desired.&nbsp; After installing MiniDLNA Luci still shows Free space: 17% (416.00 KB).&nbsp; It has only been running for about 12 hours so does not have the one week plus burn in but I&#039;m pretty confident at this point.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Setting up the mount point and share seems to work as advertised with this release.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t have to SSH in and mount the NTSF drive from the command line.&nbsp; After a year of trying dd-wrt builds that I would have to reboot 2 or 3 times a week to keep the wireless going I&#039;m wondering why I didn&#039;t try building openwrt sooner.&nbsp; Of course, time will tell!&nbsp; I probably still won&#039;t use MiniDLNA even though its installed as it still won&#039;t index/steam mpg files.&nbsp; I tested the install of this bin from the stock web and it upgraded to openwrt with no problem.&nbsp; Also tested installing from the r33174 build and that went Ok too.&nbsp; If you do upgrade from the previous openwrt be sure to&nbsp; uncheck the Keep Settings box.&nbsp; One of the times I bricked was trying to keep the settings and using the sysupgrade bin.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if it was the build or that I tried to keep the settings.&nbsp; I did however backup the settings from r33174 and apply them to r33324 with no issues.&nbsp; As near as I can tell this build should be the same as the recent beta release.</p><p>Here&#039;s the link to the bin:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?km5o24uz4y1b2u2">http://www.mediafire.com/?km5o24uz4y1b2u2</a></p><p>Enjoy.</p>									</div>

					<p>I thought that to be the case but the bin was too large when I tried to include it and not enough room to install via package installer.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t willing to give up other features to make room.&nbsp; It is more of a personal challenge that a need.&nbsp; In any case I appreciate the work of all the developers and I&#039;m happy with the build I have!</p>									</div>

					<p>@rocker2344&nbsp; I hadn&#039;t tried loading from dd-wrt so not sure what your problem may be from there.&nbsp; If you can flash back to dd-wrt via tftp you should be able to do the same with my build of openwrt.&nbsp; Have you tried flashing via tftp yet?&nbsp; If you haven&#039;t done so with dd-wrt it would probably be a good idea to reset to factory settings before loading the firmware.&nbsp; You could also reload the stock firmware from the dd-wrt web gui and then load the openwrt from there.&nbsp; I know that works as I&#039;ve done it several times.&nbsp; I do know that every time I tried to load firmware from openwrt to openwrt and I forgot to uncheck the keep settings box I would get bricked and have to use the serial console to recover, even when using the sysupgrade bin.&nbsp; There could be a similar issue going from dd-wrt.</p><p>I&#039;m actually been running a version a few releases later and have gone almost 2 weeks without touching the router other than checking the statistics.&nbsp; It looks like the wifi has slowly dropped connection speed over that time but I have not experienced any troubles with video streaming during that time.&nbsp; Until today that is, but I couldn&#039;t confirm which end the problem was.&nbsp; I reset the access point (Trendnet TEW-640MB) to the PS3 that does the streaming and just hit the wireless save settings button on the E2100L.&nbsp; That fixed the problem.&nbsp; I should have checked after doing the access point but didn&#039;t think about it at the time.</p><p>Jim</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jimfree</strong> on 26 Sep 2012, 04:03)</p>

					<p>@jimfree<br />Yes i tried tftp. it sent nothing idk why<br />i did a 30-30-30 and installed from dd-wrt webui<br />i did a 30-30-30 and installed from linksys webui<br />i did a 30-30-30 and tftp again</p><p>Also i think my wireless radio is burnt but i dont care because i mainly use it as a switch with extra powers (how do i know ssh sees ath0 but i cant put it up and dd-wrt reports the mac as 00:00:00:00:00:00)<br />it has been destroyed for a while just thought i might mention that because it might be holding it back.</p>									</div>

					<p>@rocker2344&nbsp; You just reminded me of one of the reasons I gave up on dd-wrt, I was also getting the wireless mac address of 00:00:00:00:00:00.&nbsp; I don&#039;t remember the dd-wrt version that started though.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing everything was working OK when the linksys firmware was installed? Curious to know if the mac address showed up while the linksys was installed, if you checked for that.&nbsp; I can&#039;t think of a single reason why either of the openwrt bins I posted wouldn&#039;t work as they both had several days of burn in and were working fine on my E2100L.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t received any feedback other than yours.&nbsp; I was hoping to hear from wintoon to see if it worked for him.&nbsp; I currently running r33362 which was supposed to fix some issues with mount and unmount usb drives.&nbsp; I discovered later that the issues are still there.&nbsp; I thought they were fixed but I still have to use ssh to mount the drive.&nbsp; Luci shows the mount point correctly in the webui but it doesn&#039;t mount the drive.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; If you want to try r33362 let me know and I&#039;ll put it out there too.</p><p>Jim</p>									</div>

					<p>Sounds like you might have some sort of underlying hardware problem.&nbsp; My current uptime is 13d 16h 49m 36s.</p><p>Edit:&nbsp; Just thought of something, were you in the process or finished making any configuration changes when it stopped working?&nbsp; It&#039;s possible that a bug is in there that didn&#039;t show up in the way I configured mine.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t touch any of the switch configurations for example.&nbsp; Were you able to reboot back to OpenWrt after it stopped?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jimfree</strong> on 27 Sep 2012, 01:05)</p>

					<p>Are you getting any ping responses from the router?&nbsp; SSH or Telnet both not working either?&nbsp; TFTP service doesn&#039;t run all the time, you need to catch it during the bootup process, not the easiest thing to do as the window of opportunity is very short.&nbsp; Are you using the command prompt window to tftp?&nbsp; I found it easier to use a gui version that automatically tries the tftp every second or so while booting the router.&nbsp; Makes it easier to hit that short window of opportunity.&nbsp; I think I downloaded it somewhere off of the dd-wrt site.&nbsp; Don&#039;t remember for sure.</p>									</div>
