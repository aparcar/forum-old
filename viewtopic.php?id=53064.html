					<p>Hi, I would like to know how to install OpenWRT 14.07 BarrierBreaker (final release) on a Buffalo wli-tx4-ag300n wireless bridge. The provided sysupgrade binaries can&#039;t be flashed using the web interface and there are no instructions on the Wiki.

					<p>you should start with the file labeled &quot;factory&quot; to flash in the stock interface. i don&#039;t know anything about this particular device though. Feel free to update the wiki if you get it to work.</p>									</div>

					<p>There actually isn&#039;t any factory image for this device, only the sysupgrade file. I found this to be somewhat odd, but I thought there might be a procedure to modify the header of the firmware image since this bridge uses a Gemtek hardware design that requires an image file with a special header. Does anybody have any ideas?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jmzale</strong> on 3 Oct 2014, 03:33)</p>
