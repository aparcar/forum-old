					<p>I have a pfSense proxy server, that I&#039;m placing in my network.&nbsp; It&#039;s create a blocking traffic to specific sites at specified times, but one thing that the box just can&#039;t do is serve wireless internet; this is largely because it&#039;s so hard to get a Wireless N card for FreeBSD when you&#039;re using hardware that&#039;s as old as mine is.</p><p>Since OpenWRT is great at serving wireless traffic I thought I would connect a wireless OpenWRT router on the ethernet LAN interface of the pfSense proxy and configure it so that pfSense would use DHCP to dole out ips to wireless clients though it.</p><p>I&#039;m not entirely sure where to get started on this, but it seems to me that using relayd holds some promise in this arena.&nbsp; </p><p>In the past I&#039;ve <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient">used relayd to create a pseudo bridge between two wireless access points</a>, for purposes of connecting computers with only ethernet NICs to the same network via a wireless link.&nbsp; When I did this the DHCP Server on the local OpenWRT machine was disabled so that the one from the other network could be used.</p><p>In the pfSense situation I would like to hopefully use relayd to connect the pfSense LAN interface to the OpenWRT wireless, but I&#039;m uncertain of where to begin.&nbsp; </p><p>It seems to me that in the configuration file I should opt for a wlan instead of a wwan and make the gateway be pfSense.&nbsp; Is that correct?</p>									</div>
