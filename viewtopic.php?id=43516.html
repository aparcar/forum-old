					<p>Hi!</p><p>I have tried to install OpenWrt to get two wireless networks but didn&#039;t succeed, so I have reverted back to the original firmware. </p><p>I want a quite simple setup since i already have a firewall:</p><p>the WAN (eth1) should be a trunk with 2 VLANs:</p><p>Guest network:<br />VLAN 7 <br />Guest wireless network (no access to the lan ports or other VLAN.<br />IP-address: 10.0.8.2/24 (it should not be possible to acccess the wireless AP from this network)<br />Default gateway, DNS and DHCP server: 10.0.8.1</p><p>Client network:<br />VLAN 4<br />LAN ports should be access ports (untagged)<br />Wireless network should use this VLAN as well. <br />IP-address for the interface: 10.0.1.2/24 (should also be able to access the wireless AP from here)<br />Default gateway, DNS and DHCP server: 10.0.1.1</p><br /><p>- The AP should not route traffic between the two VLAN&#039;s, but send it to the default gw for firewall rules.<br />- All traffic should be allowed to and from both networks, since this is controlled from my firewall that is connected to the WAN port.<br />- AP should not be set up as a DHCP server.</p><br /><br /><p>Here is more info regarding ports and other stuff from the WNDR3700: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3700">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3700</a></p><p>Any suggestion on how to configure that? I have tried a couple of time but had to reset the config each time.</p>									</div>
