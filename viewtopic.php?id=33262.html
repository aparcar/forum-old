					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>Today I&#039;ve received my Netgear WNDR3800 router.</p><p>First I&#039;ve tried the router to see how it performs with the original firmware (1.0.0.6) but for some reason the PPPoe did not work at all, tough if I set the computer directly to the internet (without router with the same PPPOe settings) it worked fine, no problem.</p><p>Then I&#039;ve decided to give up the original firmware and try the OpenWrt one and I&#039;ve uploaded first (via tftp) the initial installation ...factory.img file (from the first link mentioned bellow) but after reflash the router enters into an unusable state , tough I can ping 192.168.1.1 but the admin webpage is not working and neither the router. Has someone tried that image before ?</p><p>So I flashed back the original firmware but I have the same PPPoe problems. With the original ones (and I&#039;ve tried 1.0.0.6 , 1.0.0.24 and 1.0.0.25 beta) I can&#039;t connect to the Internet<br />It looks the PPPOe is not working with this router or I don&#039;t know ... if I connect the PC directly to internet with the same PPPOE settings everything is working fine, but with the same user/password the Netgear is not working ... any idea what could be wrong ? I&#039;ve spend all day on this without being able to figure it out what&#039;s wrong.</p><br /><br /><div class="quotebox"><cite>hnyman wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Initial installation:<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-wndr3800-squashfs-factory.img">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … actory.img</a></p><p>for later upgrades:<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-wndr3800-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … pgrade.bin</a></p><p>Or you could also look into this:<br /><a href="http://enduser.subsignal.org/~trondah/releases/r29341/">http://enduser.subsignal.org/~trondah/releases/r29341/</a><br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27722">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27722</a></p><p>(In general, also all the 3700v2 builds should work ok, as the difference between 3700v2 and 3800 is just the RAM amount.)</p></blockquote></div>									</div>

					<p>After many reboots to default with stock firmware I&#039;ve managed somehow to make it work, to have an internet connection over ppoe .<br />However the WAN speed is very slow, the webpage reports the router connects at 10Mb/s only ... tough the computer connected directly to internet via ppoe reports a 100Mb/s (my ISP offers me a 100Mb/s service connection).<br />I wrote to Netgear about this and they think there is a hardware issue with this product and I should return it back ... wtf ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Well I don&#039;t have a modem, I have an optic fiber link to outside of the building into a &quot;box&quot; and from there an Ethernet cable to my house which goes directly to the WAN port of the router.

					<p>I&#039;ve connected the WAN port to gigabit switch , so the switch is between ISP and router .<br />I&#039;ve let the WAN port on DHCP and the port is reported connected at 1000Mb/s but it won&#039;t get any IP address ( which is normal as my ISP requires PPPOE).<br />If I change the WAN settings from DHCP to PPOE, the router behaves the same it won&#039;t connect , the link port of WAN is reported DOWN, no TX and no RX at all.</p><p>If I put everything back ( eliminate the switch, put the ISP link back to WAN port of the router ):<br />- on DHCP I have port connection up and down continuously , when up is reported at 100Mb/s <br />- change DHCP to PPPOE and link remains down ...&nbsp; </p><p>After 30 minutes without doing nothing the PPPOE link is UP and running, I have internet access but a very slow one.<br />The PPPOE port reports only 10Mb/s speed, and download/upload speed tests reports very low speeds ~1 MB/s&nbsp; only</p><p>So I really don&#039;t know what&#039;s wrong but it looks that is not working with PPPOE, not sure if is a hardware issue or what ...</p><p>PS&gt; should it matter if the ISP cable has shielded RJ45 connector or not ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dinoc</strong> on 6 Dec 2011, 00:32)</p>

					<p>Obviously it was a problem with this router , without any other switch involved it won&#039;t connect properly via PPPOE.<br />With stock firmware I can connect via PPPOE only after 30 minutes after reboot but at very low speed only 10Mb/s (pppoe port speed)<br />But with the OpenWRT firmware it doesn&#039;t connect at all via PPPOE ... so that&#039;s it for me, I&#039;ve spent enough time on this so I gave up and returned the router back.</p><p>I&#039;ve ordered that Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH you recommended me ... touch I&#039;ll have to wait ~ 10 days to receive it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dinoc</strong> on 6 Dec 2011, 13:17)</p>
