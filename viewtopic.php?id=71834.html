					<p>Hey guys.&nbsp; Been using openwrt since almost the beginning, but I&#039;m coming up short on this one.&nbsp; </p><p>Does anyone know of a known good working pci-e card that works under openwrt x86?&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Ideally, I&#039;d like it to have 2.4/5g support.&nbsp; </p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

The amount of supported distributions speaks volumes.

					<p>Well, yes, but linux support doesn&#039;t guarantee openwrt support.&nbsp; Each of the wifi cards I have bought so far works great under gentoo, but refuses to work under openwrt.&nbsp; </p><p>So, anyone actually get a specific pci-e card working under openwrt x86/x64?</p>									</div>

					<p>Which cards are those?&nbsp; OpenWrt gets the drivers from the mainstream kernel.&nbsp; </p><p>Atheros &quot;ath9k&quot; hardware has excellent compatibility.&nbsp; The ath10k for 802.11ac is good but not perfect.&nbsp; You will probably need two cards in the machine to operate simultaneously on both bands.&nbsp; Dual band cards almost all only work on one band at a time.</p><p>Note that unlike a desktop distribution, OpenWrt x86 does not include any wifi drivers by default.&nbsp; You have to identify the chipset in your card and install the proper driver.</p>									</div>
