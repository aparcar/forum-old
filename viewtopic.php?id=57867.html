					<p>I accidentally brick my dsl modem, (if deleting all the flash trying stupid things is an accident)&nbsp; . Using jtag is slow and i not so good soldering, So i try using a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Signstek-SOIC8-Socket-Adpter-Programmer/dp/B00V9QNAC4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433832695&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=soic/">soic clip</a> and flashrom (from linux pc) </p><p>As programer i use buspirate, however its easy to use othe tings, like a raspberry, or even computer motherboard.&nbsp; only need point flashrom to the programer.</p><p>First make a flahsh copy</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> tp# flashrom -p buspirate_spi:dev=/dev/ttyUSB0,pullups=on,spispeed=1M -r tplink.bin </code></pre></div><p> </p><p>I have old backup with atheros caldata (art) but you can extract from extracted tplink.bin </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> dd if=tplink.bin of=caldata.bin bs=1 skip=8323072</code></pre></div><p> </p><p>the numbers are total flash 8 MiB converted to decimal bit 8388608 <br />Art partition last 64 kib in dec 65536<br />dd takes a file, ignores first 8323072 bit and writes the rest 65536 to caldata.bin . i am really bad changing those numbers, i use a calculator and change from hex to dec. </p><p>With clear copy of a working flash you can use any hexeditor and change de last 64 kib with your caldata, or flash direcly and write from openwrt command line, i use old working copy, so i flash it (as root)<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> # flashrom -p buspirate_spi:dev=/dev/ttyUSB0,pullups=on,spispeed=1M -w tplinkgood.bin </code></pre></div><p> </p><p>Several coments, flashrom tries to write at maximun speed, (8M for my flash) and fails, Im unsure why, maybe something in circuit cant work at this speed, or the use of large wires broke com, i dont know. </p><p>Slowering spispeed parameter works for me.&nbsp; I only conect 6 pins (the soic have 8)&nbsp; take a look to this <a href="https://www.fishnetsecurity.com/6labs/blog/demystifying-hardware-security-%E2%80%93-part-iii/">spi programing post</a>&nbsp; when im writing flash one of the led is on. however, everithing goes ok. maybe in other devices desoldering is a must, but give a try to a clip programing, is easy and fast.</p>									</div>
