					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am interested how secure is OpenWrt compared to classic Linux? I installed openwrt some months ago and it looks like it is not multiuser - am I wrong? Is it possible to run each daemon with different user with restricted privileges?</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenWrt was not designed to be multiuser, but I believe that you can add new accounts to /etc/passwd and set up specific processes to use these.&nbsp; It really depends on how you want to set up your router.&nbsp; Ideally, you would only want your router to &#039;route&#039;, and have other systems perform the actual work.</p><p>Overall, OpenWrt is as secure as any other Linux, no matter what you are running, if you start poking holes in it, you need to understand exactly what you are doing, and why you are doing it.</p>									</div>

					<p>I know that the kernel is identical to other Linux distributions but several extra daemons are developed by volunteers and probably some of them are not excellent from security viewpoint.</p>									</div>
