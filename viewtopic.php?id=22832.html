					<p>I&#039;ve been following the following (old) tutorial (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071210042854/http://people.bu.edu/ebishop/openwrt-programming.html">http://web.archive.org/web/200712100428 … mming.html</a>) to create a helloworld program in C++. I want to write something a lot bigger but obiously first I need to get this working. And for the project I want to make I would really like to be able to use C++ and uClibc++.</p><p>I downloaded the kamikaze 8.09.1 source and build the SDK as described in part 3 of the tutorial. This all works perfectly and I have a plain C version of helloworld working.</p><p>The problem is that I followed part 2 of the tutorial to upgrade to C++ and link against uClibc++. In the white russian release (which I accidental used before) this worked perfectly. In the kamikaze release however the build fails with the following messages:</p><p>helloworld.cpp:4:20: error: iostream: No such file or directory<br />helloworld.cpp:5:18: error: string: No such file or directory</p><p>Of course I tried to incorporate part of the uClibc++ sample file from this tutorial (<a href="http://nuwiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/BuildingPackagesHowTo#sample.makefile.for.c.shipped.with.configure.script.and.uclibc.linkables">http://nuwiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/Build … .linkables</a>). These however rely on include directories under the $(BUILDIR) which are not present in the 8.09.1 version. When creating a symlink to their actual location all hell breaks loose when compiling.</p><p>I hope any of you can give me some advice on fixing my problem, a working Makefile or point me to a tuturial that actually works with the SDK of version 8.09.1. Anything will be greatly appreciated! I&#039;ve been struggling with this problem for days now so I&#039;m at the point of pulling my hair out <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>This is my Project Makefile<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>##############################################
# OpenWrt Makefile for helloworld program
#
#
# Most of the variables used here are defined in
# the include directives below. We just need to
# specify a basic description of the package,
# where to build our program, where to find
# the source files, and where to install the
# compiled program on the router.
#
# Be very careful of spacing in this file.
# Indents should be tabs, not spaces, and
# there should be no trailing whitespace in
# lines that are not commented.

include $(TOPDIR)/rules.mk

# Name and release number of this package

# Specify what needs to be done to prepare for building the package.
# In our case, we need to copy the source files to the build directory.
# This is NOT the default.  The default uses the PKG_SOURCE_URL and the

#########################################################################################
# The Build/Compile directive needs to be specified in order to customize compilation
# and linking of our program.  We need to link to uClibc++ and to specify that we
# do NOT want to link to the standard template library.
#
# To do this we define the LIBS variable.  To prevent linking to the standard libraries we
# add &quot;-nodefaultlibs&quot; to the $(LIBS) variable and then specify &quot;-lgcc -lc&quot; to ensure that
# there are no unresolved references to internal GCC library subroutines. Finally
# &quot;-luClibc++&quot; to link to the  uClibc++ library.  Also, we need to specify &quot;-nostdinc++&quot;
# in the compiler flags to tell the compiler that c++ standard template library functions
# and data structures will be linked to in specified external libraries and not the
# standard libraries.

# the router. The $(1) variable represents the root directory on the router running
# OpenWrt. The $(INSTALL_DIR) variable contains a command to prepare the install
# directory if it does not already exist.  Likewise $(INSTALL_BIN) contains the
# command to copy the binary file from its current location (in our case the build
