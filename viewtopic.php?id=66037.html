					<p>I was undecided about whether to get the Linksys E1700 or Archer C20i, and ended up going for the C20i since it was slightly cheaper and the E1700&#039;s reviews on its WiFi range didn&#039;t seem great.</p><p>But the C20i is now bricked, and I don&#039;t know whether it is possible to de-brick it via serial (or even how). So I&#039;m trying to figure out whether to go for the E1700 or wait for someone to respond in the C20i thread about how to fix it....</p><p>So it would be good if someone could recommend a good router with at least 8MiB of Flash and foolproof OpenWrt support, but I&#039;ve been looking for quite a while and can&#039;t find one really. Unfortunately it seems that a lot of the tried and tested router models, like the Netgear WNDR3700v2, TP-LINK TL-WDR4900, etc, are no longer on the market. They&#039;ve either been replaced by a new version number that is unsupported, or discontinued entirely.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>a7201</strong> on 6 Jul 2016, 22:01)</p>
