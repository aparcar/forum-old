					<p>Hi, I have a WRT54GL with WhiteRussian installed. I have added some files to my hosts file to block some sites. I&#039;ve sent them to 127.0.0.1 What i&#039;m wondering is when you try access one of the blocked pages it comes up with a page that says &#039;It works!&#039; and i would like to put my own page there instead but I have tried to find it by ssh into the wrt&nbsp; and using find and grep but i can&#039;t. Is there anyone out there who knows how i could find and edit this page.</p><p>Thanks<br />Scott Dolin</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, i am very disheartened that no one knows how to change this page. Does anyone know of anyother way i could do by redirecting traffic to another http server or anything of that nature, i&#039;m sure there must be a way to do it, i&#039;m just laking in knowledge. </p><p>Any advice would be helpfull, thanks.<br />Scott Dolin</p>									</div>
