					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;ve got the idea to use a 3G Stick as backup-WAN. In fact, I want to use it only if my main WAN (VDSL) does not work. In all other cases I do not need the Stick, so there is no need for load-balancing or traffic routing on both interfaces at the same time.</p><p>So, is multiwan what I need? If multiwan is the correct package, what else do I need?<br />What are the correct settings to use multiwan in my setting?</p><p>For my first testings I want to use a ZTE K3565-Z, which is working flawlessy under Debian.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>naturelle</strong> on 6 Sep 2013, 21:49)</p>

					<p>Thank you, so as I understand your second link, I do not need something like multiwan, multiwan itself would be counterproductive.<br />I am not really good in scripting things, so my actual problem is to estimate which of the scripts shown in the thread is best value for me. In fact, I really need what the first poster described. My environment:<br />VDSL, the openWRT is working behind a modem and is handling out the logically VDSL-connection (login&amp;password) and then following getting IP.</p><p>So, is his (the first) script best value, or is there a better choice at the bottom of the thread?</p><p>And: why is he creating a new route via DSL-connection? I don&#039;t understand that, perhaps because of my poor english. My german is really much better <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>naturelle</strong> on 7 Sep 2013, 13:00)</p>

					<p>First let me say that I have neither used multiwan nor any of the scripts myself.</p><p>But a quick search resulted in those links.<br />Mutiwan should do the job - but there appear to have been issues which lead to the development of mwan2.<br />Meanwhile mwan2 is outdated and replaced by mwan3, see here:<br /><a href="http://%20https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=176616#p176616"> https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.ph â€¦ 16#p176616</a></p><p>Multiwan and wan3 are capable of much more than just setting up a failover connection.</p><p>The scripts of mateuszkj, rossb and christian1980nrw all seem quite straight forward to me. Easy to read and follow. Just plug in your network interfaces and addresses. Christian even has a German blog.</p><p>However, if you dont feel safe with a script you don&#039;t understand, you will find a Howto on mwan3 <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/mwan3"> here </a>, and you can even configure it with LuCI.<br />Just try. How goes that saying in German? &quot;Versuch macht kluch&quot;? ;-)</p>									</div>
