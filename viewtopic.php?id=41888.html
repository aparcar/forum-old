					<p>A few weeks ago I bought a RT-N16. I wanted to use OpenWrt as I use it on a baby Asus device but I did not look beyond the &quot;Not supported&quot; in the supported devices section. So I went with DDWRT. Now I wanted a guest WIFI and set that up and all was well.</p><p>After a few days although the GUI claimed the WIFI was up and the LED was on neither of the two WIFI enabled devices I have could see either network. Whereas they could when I first started.</p><p>Power cycling did nothing. I then tried Tomato - nothing. Restored the Asus 3.* f/w - WIFI comes back. Reinstall DDWRT - no WIFI. As the box was also smelling rather more than one would expect for new electronics I RMAed the box.</p><p>By the time I got the replacement I had discovered that the RT-N16 was sort of supported unofficially. So I installed OpenWrt and started playing. Set up main and guest WIFI and could see and log in to either. Whilst working on the configuration I changed the SSID of the main network - The guest network promptly vanished from site surveys. A power cycle has not brought it back and both the GUI and the LED claim it is active. So far the main WIFI is still visible.</p><p>Anyone?</p><p>TIA</p>									</div>

					<p>Nothing useful and now the main WIFI has gone walkies. Can&#039;t see either. Exactly the same as the first box I sent back. Takes about a week from new.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well I would but I am having problems getting files off the Asus to somewhere I can paste into here :-)</p><p>Actually jow in another thread has pointed out that the GUI does not support the switch correctly on the RT-N16 - Gigabit routers have the CPU on 8 rather than 5 but do anything with the switch page of the GUI and it changes it to 5 so it is not that amazing that things would stop working.</p><p>Now I have hand crafted /etc/config/network we shall see.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well - Same as the first. Create a guest WIFI and initially both the main and the guest network visible and I could login to both with WPA2/AES. Then, after some time, the guest vanishes. Does not show in any site survey on any device I have. If I connect to the main visible wifi then the wifi led on the router flashes and I get in. If I try to connect to the guest as if it were a &quot;hidden&quot; network the led does not flash&nbsp; and eventually the client times out. The router GUI OTOH claims both are working. The main has been solid for 24 hours - in that I can still connect to it that is.</p><p>Have read through both kernel and system logs and can see nothing related that could throw any light on what&#039;s happening - or not. And they both have most likely wrapped by now :-(</p><p>openwrt-35318-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx </p><p>If I ssh in and run /sbin/wifi down followed by /sbin/wifi up I get the folloing in kernel log:</p><p>[174206.228000] br-lan: port 2(wl0) entered disabled state<br />[174206.240000] br-coldpatch: port 2(wl0.1) entered disabled state<br />[174230.476000] br-lan: port 2(wl0) entered forwarding state<br />[174230.480000] br-lan: port 2(wl0) entered forwarding state<br />[174232.484000] br-lan: port 2(wl0) entered forwarding state</p><p>But in the ssh session I get:</p><p>root@OpenWrt:/etc/init.d# /sbin/wifi down<br />root@OpenWrt:/etc/init.d# /sbin/wifi up<br />wl0: Invalid argument<br />wl0: Invalid argument<br />wl0: Invalid argument<br />Command &#039;set ssid&#039; failed: -1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>Hmmm Not sure where to look next.</p>									</div>

					<p>Found it - I think. I eventually found a typo in the config where in a couple of&nbsp; places the guest name had differing case. Hard to&nbsp; spot in the GUI. Corrected the case and the network appeared and could be connected to.</p><p>But I still get the errors in the previous post.</p>									</div>
