Its been working fine. however on occasions i would notice that my Wake on lan packets would not make their way from WAN to LAN (i have the setup for this in place, that is not the problem). This has happened to me as long as i can remeber, therefore i usually a cron job that reboots the router on monday and Friday in the morning. This usually keeps me from running into this problem.</p><p>however today i decided to dig into this. The issue just occurred few minutes again after like two months. So i decided trouble shoot. I also notice that i cannot access anything in my my LAN from WAN for apps that i have setup port forwarding etc. The leads me to believe that NAT is possibly not working?<br />I simply restarted the firewall on the router but that hasnt solved the issue.</p><p>Which module does Natting?</p><p>before i reboot the router i would like to know, once and for all what could be causing this.Thanks</p></blockquote></div><p>So while i got no response from anyone, i thought i would post my findings here for someone else who might run into the same problem.<br />So it seems that &quot;Enable SYN-flood protection&quot; which is enabled by default sometimes goes nuts and starts blocking the WOL packets coming from the the WAN. Now i&#039;ve gone ahead and disabled that feature for now, which i know is opening up connection for actual DOS attacks that might occur on my router. But i saw no other fix now.</p><p>Does anyone have any better suggestions? Thanks</p>									</div>

I&#039;m sending wol packets from the internet to inside my Lan. I think I will put some rules in the firewall to specifically allow incoming traffic on my wol ports, then enable the SYN flood protection to see if it still keeps working.<br />Now keep in mind I&#039;ve been using this for years without any problem. Only until last year I started having problemsthat wol would stop working until I rebooted the router. And then as of yesterday with the new cc build, my wol doesn&#039;t work at all if syn flood protection is enabled.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>alirz</strong> on 25 Sep 2016, 17:39)</p>

					<p>A note to the security conscious doing their own owrt build. <a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160922.txt">This</a> note about the issue and openssl release 1.0.2i to address. I have not seen anything in the owrt github so you may have to patch up your build to use that release.</p><p>@alirz, Been a long time since I looked at WOW, but I thought all the recipes I saw required FW rule, some even had some C programs required to accomplish getting the broadcast packet through. But it has been a while.</p><p>Edit: Not sure how you are implementing things but... In a secure manner the package luci-app-fwknop / fwknop daemon may offer a way; they even have an Android client app. But does not offer the old port knockers flexibility of just configuring a WOL in the config file. You could just grab some code for a port listener in language flavour of choice and modify to implement a simple, but specific to device on LAN, maybe just table driven.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Villeneuve</strong> on 25 Sep 2016, 21:13)</p>
