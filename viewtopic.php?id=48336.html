					<p>No, and I&#039;m almost sure you won&#039;t find any alternative firmware working on at least one cable modem.</p><p>What works perfectly is another router connectected to it, for example tl-wr841n has somewhere between 1-2W power consumption and is pretty cheap, real 60MBit throughput on wifi. Most cable modems (without wifi) are usualy in bridge mode, so you have public IP on your wan interface. It works perfectly out of the box, just flash openwrt, connet cable, enable wifi and you&#039;re ready to go. For faster links than 50 mbit it is good to buy more expensive TL-WDR4300 or cheaper TL-WDR3600, these have about 4-5W power consumption, faster wifi, usb and gigabit ports.</p>									</div>
