					<p>I built and installed Kamikaze trunk r11625 onto a Netgear WGT634U. The build went fine with no errors. I followed the instructions on the wiki &lt;<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Netgear/WGT634U">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har … ar/WGT634U</a>&gt; to clear the flash before loading the new image.</p><p>When the router boots, it goes through a mostly normal sequence, except it doesn&#039;t initialize and mount the jffs2 partition on first boot. This leaves the system as read-only, so no changes can be made. It also means that the /etc/config/network and /etc/config/wireless files can&#039;t be created, making the router fairly useless.</p><p>dmesg shows the necessary pieces are there:</p><p>squashfs: version 3.0 (2006/03/15) Phillip Lougher<br />Registering mini_fo version $Id$<br />JFFS2 version 2.2.

					<p>I was mistaken. The jffs partition root_data will NOT mount because the mount point is missing. The initial mount point is supposed to be /rom/jffs which is used in the /bin/firstboot script. However, that mount point is missing and can&#039;t be created because it is on a read-only file system so the jffs partition can&#039;t be mounted in the normal manner.</p><p>Gus</p>									</div>

					<p>I was having this same problem and tried to hunt it down.</p><p>At bootup I was seeing this from mount_root:</p><p>jffs2 not ready yet; using ramdisk<br /> [and from the firstboot ramoverlay function:]<br />mini_fo: using base directory: /<br />mini_fo: using storage directory: /tmp/root</p><p>... which it does when it doesn&#039;t see the magic number on the jffs parition. However later on in init.d/done it checks if we&#039;re running with ramdisk for backing store and tries to initialize and pivot over to jffs, that test is &#039;-d /tmp/root&#039; and looking at the console logs from every time it failed for me there&#039;s no error either up front (mount_root) or in the end (&#039;S95done&#039;) yet S95done didn&#039;t run the block of code that initializes jffs. Running it by hand works fine.</p><p>After booting in the failure mode I see:</p><p>root@OpenWrt:/sbin# cat /proc/mounts<br />rootfs / rootfs rw 0 0<br />/dev/root / squashfs rw 0 0<br />proc /proc proc rw 0 0<br />sysfs /sys sysfs rw 0 0<br />tmpfs /tmp tmpfs rw,nosuid,nodev 0 0<br />tmpfs /dev tmpfs rw 0 0<br />devpts /dev/pts devpts rw,mode=600 0 0<br />mini_fo:/tmp/root /mnt mini_fo rw 0 0<br />none /proc/bus/usb usbfs rw 0 0</p><p>which would explain why S95done didn&#039;t initialize the jffs from the ramdisk (it expects it mounted on /tmp/root). Tracking back a bit it looks like this all depends on &#039;/rom&#039; being available and there&#039;s no /rom known to the kernel (the squashfs is mounted r/w on /). My prior embedded work didn&#039;t use mini_fo (I just mounted a full ramdisk copy and pivoted over to it) so I&#039;m guessing there&#039;s some trick with /rom I&#039;m just not seeing. Maybe this is a kernel config thing and the config was old/skewed after I did the svn update (?).</p><p>Anyway, I&#039;m now unable to reproduce the issue with r11801, and going back to a fresh checkout of r11625 (where it was failing before) is now working (WTF)... I&#039;m guessing that this is either a timing thing or maybe something related to doing an &#039;svn update&#039; and a &#039;make clean&#039; then &#039;make&#039; (some leftover thing in the toolchain perhaps?) vs a full checkout and build from scratch.</p><p>If you ever figured this out I&#039;d love to hear the resolution (after spending half a day trying to run it down and then having the problem disappear). Everythings working fine for me now with my fresh checkout so I&#039;m going to move on with what I really wanted to do.</p><p>-Eric</p>									</div>

					<p>No need for a fresh checkout. Save some bandwidth and do this instead: use svn status --noignore and delete everything marked as ignored except the downloaded source tarballs if you have them in your build tree. Then run svn --revert -R . to make sure none of the files are modified.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Wodin</strong> on 13 Jul 2008, 13:26)</p>

					<p>Thanks, good idea. I didn&#039;t know there was a way to ignore the &#039;ignore&#039; property from the cmd line, handy!</p><p>-Eric</p>									</div>
