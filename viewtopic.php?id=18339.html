					<p>Also, I noticed that the DHCP pool setup was confusing... I&#039;ve never seen a router with this behavior:</p><p>start addres: 50<br />limit: 100</p><p>means that dnsmasq will lease addresses from .50 to .253 with a maximum number of 100 leases? Isn&#039;t the normal behaviour to lease addresses from .50 to .100? Is there a way to configure dnsmasq to operate in this fashion? </p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated!</p>									</div>

					<p>The start address is the first address of the pool, limit is the actual <strong>pool size</strong> meaning start: 50, limit: 100 gives you 50-150 as pool.<br />The actual IP-Address assigned to a computer is not really random, but based on some hashing on the computers MAC address therefore it appears to be random but acutally the same computer should get the same IP-Address everytime.</p><p>You can however assign static IP-Address to given Computers (MAC-Addresses) on the Network -&gt; DHCP -&gt; Leases page of LuCI.</p>									</div>
