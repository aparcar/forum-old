					<p>Hi, I&#039;ve a PL2303 Serial to USB adapter which I use to connect an UPS. On boot the adapter attaches to ttyUSB0 and the ups software looks for the ups on that port. So far so good.<br />The problem that I&#039;m facing is that sometimes (hours, days) it seems that the adapter disconnects and reconnects on ttyUSB1 instead of ttyUSB0.</p><p>Any idea how to solve it?<br />Thanks!<br />Jose</p><br /><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@Buffalo:~# dmesg

					<p>Hi neryba,<br />Not sure if I understand correctly your point but the attachment has nothing to do with the UPS software.<br />Even with the UPS Sw uninstalled, the driver attaches to ttyUSBx itself. My question is how the driver decides to attach to ttyUSB0 or ttyUSB1</p><p>Jose</p>									</div>
