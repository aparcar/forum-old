					<p>Hello, I was updating the firmware in my router and something went wrong in the connection between the computer and the router, so I think the firmware was just partially loaded. I mean, I cannot access to the router via ssh or the browser(I&#039;m not given a ip address from the router); however,I can enter it in failsafe mode using telnet, but there if I try to mount the root partition with mount_root, I miss files&nbsp; for instance etc/config/network. </p><p>So I was wondering, whether there is a way of loading a firmware on the router with wget since it seems to work(I have set up my tftp server with the firmware but I&#039;m not able to pick up that firmware duet to an &quot;conection refuse&quot;),&nbsp; or am I condemned to make use of u-boot loader and serial port? Concerning to the use of serial port, where can I buy such a cable or it have to be handmade?</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ndarkness</strong> on 11 Apr 2013, 10:21)</p>

					<p>From the telnet in failsafe you can mtd or sysupgrade to a new image.&nbsp; You can firstboot as well, but that presumes that the initial flash was good to begin with.</p>									</div>
