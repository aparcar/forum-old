					<p>Hello,<br />I am a part of a university project that involves openWRT and I need to install Java or OpenJDK on the system, unfortunately with no luck so far. As of today the only successful installation of something java-related was JamVM but it only runs Java 1.5, which is a bit old for the project we are working on. I attempted to install standard java but even though the installation seems successful I still can’t make it running. </p><p>When I use whereis command it lists me catalog where java files are stored so I assume it is installed but if I use a simple command such as java –version I get following error:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>java: not found</code></pre></div><p>I thought that perhaps the path or java_home is set incorrectly so I decided to run java right from the folder it is installed in. Again, using java –version gives me the exact same error. </p><p>It happens regardless the version of installed java (currently it is: server-jre-8u141-linux-x64.tar.gz). </p><p>OpenJDK installation was never successful and I always receive error:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>pkg_hash_fetch_error_best_installation_candidate: Packages for open jdk-6-common found but incompatible with the architectures configured.</code></pre></div><p> </p><p>So I guess I have yet to find compatible version. </p><p>That being said, I want to ask if anyone happen to know how to install java/openJDK or maybe how to update java in jamvm? I’d be thankful for any kind of help. </p><p>I am running OpenWRT Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 from image: chaos_calmer/15.05.1/x86/64. The system is installed and running inside VirtualBox.</p>									</div>
