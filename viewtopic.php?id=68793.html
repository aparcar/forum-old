					<p>I&#039;ve rewritten the wiki OpenVPN setup guide to (hopefully) be both easier to follow and cover a much broader array of configurations.</p><p>I can&#039;t direct link to it (forum permissions), but it&#039;s the wiki page located at: /doc/howto/vpn.openvpn</p><p>The previous guide had many sections that appeared to have been written for running a TUN based server, but then had instructions for server bridging or running a client configuration haphazardly and incompletely (and in some places incorrectly!) scattered in. I&#039;ve attempted to remedy this issue by writing it for the three most common configuration types (server, server-bridge, client)</p><p>I&#039;ve also attempted to have the guide give a nearly-complete setup guide, hopefully removing (or at least greatly reducing the need for) &quot;recipe&quot; wiki pages.</p><p>However after staring at this for the last 4 days, I&#039;m afraid there might be something I&#039;ve overlooked. Let me know what you think.</p><p>I&#039;d also greatly appreciate it if someone could try to follow the guide step by step and make sure everything works. After looking at something for so long, it&#039;s too easy to think that I wrote something, but switch it during actual execution without thinking about it. That and I&#039;m kind of sick of looking openvpn in general right now.</p><p>Thoughts? Feedback?</p>									</div>

					<p>Outstanding work!</p><p>I can only speak about the client part -- I think it would be beneficial to mention the luci-app-openvpn and that besides fully uci-ing openvpn settings or dropping the config file into /etc/openvpn/ you can also create uci (and luci app) friendlier tiny config by specifying the conf-file to use in it.</p><p>Also for the client configs where the login/password authentication is required would be great to mention that you&#039;d normally create a text file and refer to it from the settings/ovpn/conf.</p>									</div>

					<p>Bravo! I followed your guide (while it was being edited <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" />) and successfully set up a TUN server (TAP didn&#039;t work for me but I might have made some mistakes).</p><p>Feedback:<br />1) This is a minor thing, but in the &quot;Test the tunnel&quot; section you should mention, before anything else, how the clients are supposed to connect to the server (e.g. with the command &quot;openvpn /path/to/conf/file&quot; in linux)<br />2) You could mention how to push nameservers to the clients to avoid DNS leaks (if the server is used to access the Internet)<br />3) How about a client+server setup on the same router? Since the client and server guides are already there, you would only need to add a new section describing the routing policies that are necessary for this to work. I&#039;m actually setting this up right now (<a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=68788">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=68788</a>) and I&#039;ve got it working, but I&#039;m still struggling a bit with the routing policies.</p>									</div>

					<p>I made some changes:<br /></p><ul><li><p>Added some bits about using .conf files</p></li><li><p>Added the bit about user/pass files</p></li><li><p>Rewrote a significant chunk of the testing and route sections.</p></li><li><p>Fixed various typos or errors.</p></li></ul><p>I&#039;m going to avoid writing a guide on how to setup a client to connect to the server, since that will be highly platform specific. I refer users to consult the manual/documentation for their client.</p><p>I think I&#039;m also going to avoid the DNS server issue. This is, by it&#039;s nature, a pretty basic guide. And pushing DNS servers contains a lot of OS-specific shenanigans on the client side of things. It&#039;s also generally just not a very useful thing aside from those looking for the strictest of security. People who require that level of security probably don&#039;t need a beginners guide, and could certainly figure out how to fill in the gaps.</p><p>Multiple OpenVPN instances is something I might address in a later revision, but probably just as a footnote somewhere with some generalized tips rather than full-on instructions. It&#039;s too use-case specific to really write a catch-all instruction set for.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ExaltedVanguard</strong> on 4 Dec 2016, 00:56)</p>

					<p>Easy-RSA is plenty secure for normal users.</p><p>It probably wouldn&#039;t be the best choice if you&#039;re talking about a multi billion dollar corporation that has people and/or governments attempting to hack their way in. One would question why they didn&#039;t hire a security expert or why their security expert is reading a wiki setup guide rather than knowing what to do based off the man pages...</p><p>I also find it funny that that guide is using the openvpn machine as the CA machine. That is, the &quot;master keys&quot; are kept on the same machine as the openvpn server. If you&#039;re as security crazy as that guide is supposed to be, you&#039;d think he&#039;d advise against that.</p><p>But we don&#039;t worry about that for normal users. We just use Easy-RSA on the same machine because OpenVPN has been the &quot;standard&quot; for long enough that it&#039;s basic settings are more than adequate for the vast majority of use cases. It&#039;s been tested time and time again and if there were some massive glaring flaw it would have been fixed by now.</p>									</div>

The biggest issue is laptops running various linux distributions. OpenVPN handles DNS (in some linux distributions) by saving the DNS servers on change, then restoring those settings on disconnect. On a laptop that might be migrating between connections, this can potentially lead to the wrong DNS servers being restored, compromising connectivity.</p><p>I wrote the guide with the idea that it will set up a VPN server with basic functions and connectivity for beginners, which can also be modified to meet specific use cases by advanced users who should know to read man pages.</p><p>With that in mind, I didn&#039;t feel the need to include DNS pushing because it is not a requirement of basic functions or connectivity, and 99% of users do not require this feature. It didn&#039;t make sense to include it in a beginner&#039;s guide where it will just generate more questions and confusion. Especially when such a feature is associated with so many client-specific variables that can potentially disrupt connectivity on client machines.</p><p>If you disagree with my assessment, you can certainly add it to the guide. It&#039;s a wiki and open for anyone to edit! That&#039;s the wonderful thing about open systems like wikis.</p><p>---</p><p>Even with an &quot;optional&quot; tag, every newbie around would attempt to use the feature because it &quot;sounds&quot; like it enhances security, but in the majority of cases just impairs performance with no added benefit. There is nothing illegal about a user looking up the IP (via DNS) of (for example) a torrent website, and an ISP won&#039;t throttle your connection for checking the domain. That could happen with browser prefetching and you reading a news article that mentions it. It&#039;s the actions after that which matter and will get your throttled (or arrested...) - and those are all done via the VPN.</p><p>If you&#039;re in a situation that merely looking up a domain name would get you into hot water... Well either 1) you&#039;re under an extremely oppressive government and you need a whole lot of fire-walling and such that&#039;s WAY outside the scope of any beginners guide (and you should sure as shit know your stuff because any mistake means you&#039;re fucked). Or 2) you&#039;re looking up some sort of honeypot domain that&#039;s only mentioned in one or two places on the net so what the fucking hell were you looking up? I&#039;m not sure I want to help that person... although chances are they already know their shit anyway.</p><p>---</p><p>An alternative (which I&#039;d totally agree with, but currently have no motivation to create) would be an &quot;advanced customization of OpenVPN&quot; -guide that was linked to at the end of the beginners guide. The explanation of DNS pushing and other features would be plenty appropriate in such a location. I wonder about the utility of such a guide though, since the users who would need such features are likely able to interpret the relevant manuals directly and probably don&#039;t need a step by step guide.</p>									</div>

Only one Ethernet connection to the device.
