					<p>Hi guys, <br />yesterday i flashed my TP-Link WRD4300 and everything went well<br />I can connect via putty to Telnet and SSH..</p><p>But the router cannot connect to the internet, I think because of lan address configuration.</p><p>Any hint on how can i solve this problem?<br />If is not possible, how can i roll back to previous firmware (always without internet connection)?</p>									</div>

					<p>You might change the title of this thread, as your problem has nothing to do with Luci = GUI interface.</p><p>I don&#039;t really see, how LAN address configuration would be your problem, as you can reach the router from your LAN computers via SSH.</p><p>In case your own config attempts have broken the config, you might try rom SSH console &quot;firstboot&quot; command. It will revert your changes to Openwrt defaults.</p><p>Returing to original TP-Link&nbsp; firmware: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300#back.to.original.firmware">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl- â€¦ l.firmware</a></p><p>EDIT:<br />If you want to install Luci, do this from console:<br />opkg update<br />opkg install luci</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 20 Oct 2013, 14:06)</p>

					<p>Your initial problem is that you don&#039;t have internet, you could install luci offline from packages.</p><p>But the problem is that both your router(modem) from your isp and your openwrt router uses both the subnet 192.168.0<br />Change one of them to a different subnet and it will work.</p><p>Both routers on the same subnet, will simply create a route conflict.</p>									</div>
