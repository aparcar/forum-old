					<p>Hi There,</p><p>After installing openwrt with <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-825">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-825</a> I managed to screw up the firewall with luci.<br />I read <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe</a><br />I read <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.debrick">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.debrick</a><br />I read <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/bootloader/uboot.config">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/boo â€¦ oot.config</a><br />I read <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.flashing.tftp">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.flashing.tftp</a></p><p>I also read <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27549">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27549</a> where Slema seems to indicate that there&#039;s a bootdelay of 5 seconds and the serverip addres is 192.168.0.107</p><p>I now have the following situation When I plug a network cable into port 4,3,2 no lights come on<br />When I plug the network cable into port 1 it gives me a solid blue light.<br />Furthermore I believe I&#039;m now at the stadium where tftp is the only solution before soldering.</p><p>On my kubuntu machine I do a ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0<br />when I then ping 192.168.0.1 I see the blue light of port1 flashing.</p><p>So I think my dir-825 isn&#039;t broken as the only thing I did was trying the failsafe method followed by trying to flash the firmware again with the 45 sec method , followed by the failsafe method.</p><p>Any insight would gladly be appreciated<br />Kind regards <br />Guy Forssman</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Forsskieken</strong> on 18 May 2012, 12:01)</p>
