					<p>just wanted to post this message because I had a hell of time setting up PPTPD on backfire.</p><p>I followed the wiki @ <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.server.pptpd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.server.pptpd</a> but that really is no good.<br />After a lot of meddling and trying, it worked more or less, but only if I connected thru my LAN.<br />When I connected over the WAN, nothing worked. </p><br /><p>Then I found this wiki : <a href="http://wiki.netcompartner.com/wiki/OpenWrt_PPTP_Server">http://wiki.netcompartner.com/wiki/OpenWrt_PPTP_Server</a></p><p>This one works with a pseudo network interface. I had the whole thing up and running in 15 mins.</p><p>So kudos to them !</p>									</div>

					<p>What I&#039;d like to do is to build a VPN between two OpenWRT boxes.<br />At the moment I&#039;m running Attitude Adjustment 12.09-rc1 on both sides as one of the two boxes is not supported yet by&nbsp; Backfire 10.03.1.<br />I have followed the tutorial mentioned in the main post, with the needed changes as per 12.09-rc1.<br />My setup is &quot;Two networks - routed&quot;. On the pptpd server box I have installed all the needed packages.<br />Then I&#039;ve manually changed the needed configuration files.</p><p><strong>/etc/pptpd.conf</strong></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#debug
option /etc/ppp/options.pptpd
speed 115200
stimeout 10
#localip &amp; remoteip are not needed, ip management is done by pppd
localip 192.168.253.254</code></pre></div><p>with&nbsp; 192.168.253.254 being my box LAN ip address.</p><p><strong>/etc/ppp/options.pptpd</strong></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>debug
logfile /tmp/pptp-server.log
auth
name &quot;pptp-server&quot;
lcp-echo-failure 3

mru 1482
nobsdcomp
nodeflate
mppe required,no40,no56,stateless

Then I have rebooted the server box. Behind the PPTPd box I&#039;ve put a machine answering to SSH and PING on 192.168.253.1.<br />I can connect my PC to the PPTPd server. I can ping the server local IP (192.168.253.254). But nothing else.<br />Because the remote end of the VPN will get an IP on the same subnet as the LAN, I&#039;ve manually added also proxyarp to /etc/ppp/options.pptpd. With no luck.</p><br /><p>Is there any hint on how to troubleshoot this setup?<br />Is there anyone who successfully did it already?<br />TIA.</p><p>P.S.<br />Is it possible it&#039;s a bug in the version I&#039;m running?<br />The same PC can connect to a DD-WRT box through PPtP.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>uqbar</strong> on 27 Dec 2012, 00:58)</p>

I would say I should not get it worsen with OpenWRT, provided that I&#039;ll make it working.<br />Would you please show me how you made it work with the iptables rules?<br />The PPTP connection is working like a charm. It&#039;s the IP traffic that&#039;s not flowing at all.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>uqbar</strong> on 3 Jan 2013, 08:42)</p>
