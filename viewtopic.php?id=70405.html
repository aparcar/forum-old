					<p>So, I am new to OpenWrt. I bought 2 APs from a business that had gone out of business and was selling all of their gear. They are TP-Link TL-WA701ND v1. They already had OpenWrt installed on them and the guy I bought them from explained how to get access to them. That&#039;s where the support ended (not that I expect him to provide support). <br />I was able to flash both of them to the latest firmware. However, I&#039;m not able to run opkg update without errors, therefore I am unable to install OLSR or BATMAN-adv. I grew up on Windows and don&#039;t use command line. I am very new to this, and I am trying to learn. I want the ability to Mesh, but, it&#039;s kicking my butt. I&#039;m not sure what all needs to be included, let me know and I will do my best. I&#039;ve tried reading dummy tutorials, they are all outdated. Thanks for any help!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi what ver of openwrt did you install and how are the routers connected to the internet? It mite be as simple as not getting the rite dns ancers back to the router for opkg witch is the software manager for openwrt. When you flashed the new firmware did you un tick the box to save settings? Your issue could be left over from the old config.</p>									</div>

					<p>I flashed with &quot;openwrt-15.05.1-ar71xx-generic-tl-wa701n-v1-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin&quot;<br />The APs are connected to a managed switch, then going through a pfSense router. DHCP is all done through pfSense. DHCP is turned off on the APs.<br />I did not uncheck, I thought about it, and then ended up not doing it, should I try and reflash it and uncheck that?</p>									</div>

					<p>I am sorry I don&#039;t know what that is. If you can try and connect the router straight to the internet with the switch and install the packages you need, if it works that is! Then after put it back behind the switch. I have a c7 as a dumb AP and i had to install any packages before i&nbsp; turned off dnsmasq. Did you turn off the firewall on it? If you have a opensense box as your mane router you will not need the firewall to be running on your AP. That&#039;s all i can think of rite now, I just got in from picking up my kids from school and now have to take them kickboxing. Will check back later if i survive lol</p>									</div>

					<p>I turned the firewall off to no avail. I had someone give me the suggestion of setting the DNS instead of allowing it to be determined from the router. I am at work now and will try that later.<br />BTW, the crazy code up there is a link, however, I guess being a new member, I am unable to post a link.
