					<p>Hi All, I installed Openwrt onto my router (TP-LINK TL-WR841N) with the suggested image (<a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr841n-v8-squashfs-factory.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_a â€¦ actory.bin</a>).&nbsp; This was a success and I was able to log into the router via Luci.</p><p>However, after this I attempted to install Openvpn (opkg update; opkg install openvpn) onto the WR841N as per this link (http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.openvpn?s[]=openvpn) and it failed to install -- basically stating it could not install because it ran out of available space on the router i.e. by 16kb!</p><p>I understand these routers do not have as much memory space as others, but has anyone had this issue? and is there a way to get around this problem as I really need to get OpenVPN installed.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok so if I can&#039;t exroot my router I am guessing the best option based on tmo26&#039;s link (<a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=52388">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=52388</a>) is to find a modified/compressed image of openwrt for my router and re-flash?</p>									</div>

					<p>I think you should be able to get something working by using a network share like NFS as well. But yeah, using a compressed image with VPN on it or building yourself would probably be easier.</p>									</div>

					<p>You should install openvpn-polarssl. This is smaller and maybe fits on the flash..</p>									</div>

					<p>You have to build the image yourself, then it should fit, see buildroot wiki page.</p><p>For v8 someone made images in wr841n v8.0 thread (<a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=37010">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=37010</a>), or ask at v9 thread (<a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=48355">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=48355</a>), maybe someone has them compiled.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok I will try some of your options over the weekend and let you know the results as I have a few of these routers I want to configure and need to get the right image to work!</p>									</div>
