					<p>Hi Guys, Girls,</p><p>what I want to talk about now are just some thoughts I have in mind for about two years now. I just want to reflect on them here and talk about the idea of making roaming in wireless networks possible.</p><p>I sure know there is a standard (802.11r) that is thought for fast-hand-over and such things, but until this is implemented it would be nice to have another solution, as well as keeping the fact in mind, that older systems won&#039;t work with 802.11r as they know nothing about it.</p><p>I&#039;m working with Wifi/WLan for a few years now. Even in so called &quot;professional environments&quot; and I&#039;m facing the same problems over and over again:</p><p>- Bad/No handover depending on how good the driver of the client was implemented.<br />- multiple APs sometimes block their selfs or the other APs the radio-range overlaps with (talking about the physical range, not the frequency range).</p><p>So after being a few days in bed (damn flu), I had time to think about how to solve this problem:</p><p>Following things assumed:</p><p>- AFAIK every system that connects to a so called &quot;(E)SSID&quot; uses the &quot;BSSID&quot; to&nbsp; distinguish between the available APs that have the same &quot;(E)SSID&quot;. If I&#039;m wrong here, correct me.<br />- the &quot;BSSID&quot; normally is identical to the layer 2 hardware address, so called &quot;MAC-address&quot; (IEEE 802.11-1999).<br />- each AccessPoint (AP) is connected to the main network via cable - further on called &quot;backend&quot;. It&#039;s not using Vlan for the moment, but the use is kept in mind for security reasons. Also a different WLAN could be used.<br />- each AP has the Wifi-part (WLAN) and the backend part (LAN) bridged. <br />- each AP is using STP on the backend to transmit which client is associated to it&#039;s bridge (Yeah we could use RSTP here for faster distribution or even MSTP if we use VLan, but for the moment we just use STP).<br />- each AP considers the Wifi-part of the bridge as so called &quot;edge port&quot; which doesn&#039;t forward STP but uses it, to distribute the connected clients to the backend to make the connection available ASAP.</p><p>If we use this setup for multiple APs, then we need to create a way to share the following things with all other APs:</p><p>- PSK of the WPA/AES - connection<br />- negotiated session keys of each client/AP pair<br />- MAC of the client<br />- MAC of the actual AP the client is associated to which is *NOT* visible to the client at all<br />- signal strength of the client (updated once per second, broadcasted to all APs in a specific &quot;group&quot;, to know on which AP the signal strength of the client is best to handle the client or for doing a handover).</p><p>This information could be made available to all APs at the same time via a WLan-controller that stores this information in it&#039;s database and distributes it to the APs associated with it&nbsp; - or - the data is distributed via multicast, broadcast on the backend in encrypted packages that can only be decrypted by using the correct key, certificate, whatever. The first one could lead to a bottleneck and/or single point of failure and the latter should allow a better performance. Using a WLAN/WiFi-controller to configure the APs isn&#039;t part of this discussion but it can be used. Also the CAPWAP could be used to distribute the information.</p><p>So after having this information available to all APs that belong to a specific (E)SSID or AP-group we could simply handover a client without needing any help from it if there wasn&#039;t the BSSID which makes it impossible to hand over the client, as each AP has a different one.</p><p>So we could create roaming without changing anything on the client if we create a virtual (E)SSID and BSSID that is broadcasted from all APs in the group.</p><p>The following could be use for an example:</p><p>- AP1 (MAC/BSSID 00:00:00:00:00:01)<br />- AP2 (MAC/BSSID 00:00:00:00:00:02)<br />- Virtual ESSID (MyNet)<br />- Virtual BSSID 11:11:11:11:11:11</p><p>So if a client wants to associate to &quot;MyNet&quot; it only sees this one virtual ESSID and BSSID (11:11:11:11:11:11) and the moment it tries to associate the following happens:</p><p>- client sends assoc-request to ESSID &quot;MyNet&quot; and BSSID &quot;11:11:11:11:11:11&quot;<br />- Before any packet is send, all APs check the signal strength of the client in their database and the one the client has the best signal strength wins (AP1 in this case)<br />- AP1, the winner, distributes the initial &quot;handover&quot; for the client via multicast and then does the handshake with the client using the virtual [E|B]SSID<br />- All other APs don&#039;t respond to the client anymore<br />- client is authenticated by PSK or Certificate (Radius)<br />- dynamic session keys for encryption are negotiated<br />- AP1 distributes the MAC of the client via STP on the backend.<br />- AP1 distributes the dynamic session keys and all other information needed via one of the methods mentioned above<br />- all APs store the session keys in their database<br />- layer 2 and upper protocols are flowing from the client over AP1 to the backend (e.g. DHCP, IP-connections, whatever).</p><p>If the client starts moving, this becomes &quot;visible&quot; to the APs by the broadcasted signal strength on the backend which includes the clients MAC-address. So if the signal on the actual associated AP (AP1) starts becoming worse, all other APs recognize this&nbsp; and the one that got the best signal to the client sends a &quot;handover request/notice&quot; to the multicast-group and the connection is handed over to it. </p><p>So if the Client moves from the range of AP1 to the one of AP2, the following happens:</p><p>- The signal broadcasted from AP1 on the backend starts falling.<br />- The signal broadcast from AP2 on the backend starts rising.<br />- Then the moment arrives where the signal on AP2 is bigger/higher than the one on AP1<br />- AP2 sends &quot;the handover request&quot; to all other APs and takes over the connection of the client<br />- AP1 stop distributing the MAC of the client on the backend and sends a &quot;port down&quot; via STP<br />- AP2 distributes the MAC address of the client via STP on the backend and sends a &quot;port up&quot;<br />- AP2 communicates to the client and uses the virtual BSSID and virtual ESSID</p><p>This leads to the situation that the client isn&#039;t even recognizing that it has moved. It makes the client &quot;think&quot; it&#039;s still associated to the same AP and there hasn&#039;t been any kind of handover on the client side. Only the APs know what&#039;s going on.</p><p>It could be imagined as a virtual access point that is located on the wired network and bridged via the APs to the air. Something like &quot;layer one/802.11 over IP&quot; on the backend. Which would be great and lead to a virtual AP that is accessible everywhere, but the main idea is to encrypt the traffic on the AP that is responsible for the client so the whole &quot;system&quot; scales better in performance if we have a lot of APs in a group.</p><p>It&#039;s like running a dummy interface (dummy0) on a linux bridge, that is bridged to eth0 and when the handover occurs, dummy0 is deleted from eth0 and added to the bridge with eth1. The MAC isn&#039;t changed, and the change of the layer one connection is distributed via STP.</p><p>Doing 802.11 over IP would lead to a really small implementation on the AP as only the bridging-protocol for the backend needs to be implemented on an AP and STP and anything else is handled by the &quot;virtual AP&quot; on the backend. </p><p>For the moment there are a few things that should be checked to avoid nasty situations:</p><p>- only the AP the client is associated to, which is recognized in the APs databases and distributed via multicast on the backend, is allowed to send to the client using the virtual [E|B]SSID. And only this one is allowed to answer any requests.</p><p>- If the client is moving, and the signal starts fading on two APs, there has to be a &quot;buffer-range&quot; before a handover is done. E.g.: the signal on AP1 is 50 and on AP2 is 45. Now the client moves and the signal on AP1 is 47 and on AP2 is 47. Now we have a buffer of &quot;5&quot; so the client is only switched if the difference of signal-AP1 is 5 points lower the one on AP2. This avoids nasty situations where the signal strength is fading by two points and the client is handed over and over again. It also stops APs from doing anything wrong if the signal strength becomes the same on two or more of them.</p><p>- To avoid high traffic loads on networks running lots of those APs, they have to be grouped, and the APs have to know which group overlaps with another, to do a handover across group borders.</p><p>So this are my 2 cents todo roaming on WiFi.</p><p>If i set the MAC of the Wifi interface on my linksys manually and start hostapd for this interface, with the manually set MAC it&#039;s working.</p><p>So all described above could/should be implemented into hostapd to handle everything correctly.</p><p>What I don&#039;t know is when the hardware starts acting by itself without consulting hostapd, and how it can be controlled. </p><p>I&#039;m glad to hear from you and your ideas/comments on this as I&#039;m looking forward to try and implement this.</p><p>Thanks and have a nice weekend!</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>Dalek</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Dalek</strong> on 11 Sep 2010, 19:22)</p>

					<p>hello dalek - EXTERMINATE! <a href="http://www.3dsupply.de/products/873-exterminate/">http://www.3dsupply.de/products/873-exterminate/</a></p><p>on-topic:<br />seams a bit like reinventing the wheel. </p><p>2 different experiences come to mind:<br />- beeing part of a huge wlan network (only as user, not admin) - running around not losing net<br />- installing and using WDS as a more simple replacement.</p><p>to the first part i cant say much more than: it worked - on two occasions with two different notebooks/cards.</p><p>for the second part - well - the biggest WDS i had was 3 routers over 2 houses - a size of perhaps 150 meters of high-speed wlan.<br />every device i used there (including nintendoDS and sony psp) always choosed the access point with the strongest signal. since all access points use same SSID and encryption, the network client just hops to the one with the strongest signal. <br />for sure, there is a similar tricks for big networks, where the access points are connected via wire.</p><p>i cannot remember a single time when losing network while walking around those 3 routers. i can assure you, some of those wlan cards were cheap crap, but still had no problem. when checking manually, i got a new access point pretty fast. since the range overlaps a bit, you have some seconds to switch from one ap to another.</p><p>so your problem is solved for sure in small scale (WDS with wireless routers) and also in large scale (dont know the protocols)</p><p>from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11r-2008">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11r-2008</a><br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Handoffs are already supported under the preexisting standard. The fundamental architecture for handoffs is identical for 802.11 with and without 802.11r: the mobile device is entirely in charge of deciding when to hand off and to which access point it wishes to hand off. In the early days of 802.11, handoff was a much simpler task for the mobile device. Only four messages were required for the device to establish a connection with a new access point (five if you count the optional &quot;I&#039;m leaving&quot; message the client could send to the old access point). However, as additional features were added to the standard, including 802.11i with 802.1X authentication and 802.11e or WMM&nbsp; with admission control requests, the number of messages required went up dramatically. During the time these additional messages are being exchanged, the mobile device&#039;s traffic, including that from voice calls, cannot proceed, and the user will hear loss approaching that of seconds.[1] Generally, the highest amount of delay or loss that the edge network should introduce into a voice call is 50 msec.[2]</p><p>802.11r was launched to attempt to undo the added burden that security and quality of service added to the handoff process, and restore it back to the original four-message exchange. In this way, handoff problems are not eliminated, but at least are returned to the status quo.</p></blockquote></div>									</div>

					<p>Hello Dalek,</p><p>The idea that you have in mind is actually a roaming scheme used nowadays in Single Channel Architecture networks. By using a well-known BSSID by every (light-weigh) AP, it is possible to adquire fast handoffs. However, as SCA networks transmit under the same channel, throughput is reduced due to contention mechanisms procedures.</p><br /><p>On the other hand, 802.11r is simply a set of <strong>recommendations</strong> (it&#039;s not included in 802.11-2007) for fast transitions in 802.11i secured networks by transmitting 802.11i handshakes in parallel, instead of sending them in order.</p><br /><p>The 802.11-2007 standard does NOT define how to achieve handoffs. Instead, handoffs rules and procedures rely on vendor specific solutions.</p><br /><p>Now, here&#039;s another interesting thing: handoffs in wireless mesh networks (routed client trick) are more popular on research due to ad-hoc mode&#039;s lack of infrastructure beacon-probing behaviour.</p><p>I&#039;ve been working and researching on roaming/handoff schemes for some time, I recommend you taking a look at <a href="http://smesh.org">http://smesh.org</a> or <a href="http://www.wings.cs.sunysb.edu/~vnavda/iMesh">http://www.wings.cs.sunysb.edu/~vnavda/iMesh</a>.</p>									</div>

					<p>@mrii: The handovers you describe are way too slow to maintain most types of real-time communication, for example VoIP, video conferencing, etc. and WDS halfs the availabe bandwidth with each hop.</p><p>@Dalek: Remeber that wired LAN devices (including switches) have a MAC address cache and it might take several seconds for them to discover that a client has moved from one AP to the next, and traffic for this client should now be routed to a different port on the switch. Ideally all APs would be connected to a central device via tunnelling and all client data should be routed through that central device over the tunnels.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />I&#039;ve been looking into the same idea, and got stuck at the following problem:<br />While it is possible to put most wifi cards into a monitor mode, where they receive data but do not send ack frames, this seems not to be possible selectively for a list of clients. That means that either the APs will not send ack frames at all, which would not work, or all the APs send an ack frame each, which would create interference, and probably would not work.</p><p>I read the datasheet of the AR9271 (linked at <a href="https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Atheros_AR9271)">https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Atheros_AR9271)</a> and found a flag called PCU_INVALKEY_NOACK, which supposedly would not send an ACK if the key for a client is not found in the pcu key cache, but I have absolutely no idea if that would work.<br />There seems to exist an open source version of the chip firmware, and one of the include files has defines for the keytable (<a href="https://github.com/qca/open-ath9k-htc-firmware/blob/9cbbdfbb58d4703c76b1867e50897cb8da629dbe/target_firmware/wlan/ar5416reg.h">https://github.com/qca/open-ath9k-htc-f … r5416reg.h</a>) but it is not used anywhere.</p>									</div>
