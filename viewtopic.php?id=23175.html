					<p>Hi,<br />I bought a Chinese cell phone called Sciphone i9+++. I know the phone processor is MT6225 and the operating system is Nucleus Plus OS from Mentor Graphics (ATI) as stated here too:<br /><a href="http://home.comcast.net/~plutarch/Sciphone-i68.html">http://home.comcast.net/~plutarch/Sciphone-i68.html</a></p><p>From the above link, about the processor:<br />It is a Mediatek MT6225. Mediatek processors are ARM 7 compatible. The MT6226 and MT6227 certainly have the ARM 7EJ-S core, which is a 32-bit RISC processor that can (when properly supported by the firmware) natively run Java bytecode. The processor includes an LCD controller. </p><p>I would like to replace this Nucleus OS with Kamikaze. Well my hope is that as both are based on Linux kernel, with modifications I could make the device working. There is no documentation for the device available. What is motivating me is that, this cell phone could be obtained from China for around 50$ and it has good characteristics as a PDA but if to replace its original OS. I am not going to use it as a cell phone if the porting would be ever possible, but just as a PDA. </p><p>This is the first time I am going to try to port a Linux based OS so I appreciate any ideas. I hope this forum guide me and I could then submit further progress, to make a useful tutorial here for porting Kamikaze to a new platform.</p><p>A_A</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>arash</strong> on 14 Jan 2010, 12:49)</p>
