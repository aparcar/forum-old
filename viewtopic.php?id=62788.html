					<p>With <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=50914">arokh&#039;s feature rich build</a>, how would one start to assign the VPN to a virtual WiFi interface only? what must be undone to this base config to achieve this?</p><p>Scenario: I have signed up to a VPN service, they give the ca.crt, ta.key and *.conf files. How do I make arokh&#039;s build only use the VPN for a virtual WiFi interface, eg. SSID &quot;Openwrt-VPN&quot; on 2.4GHz, without making the whole lan go through the VPN.</p><p>I&#039;m hoping someone with arokh&#039;s build might have tried this.</p>									</div>

					<p>You do that by setting up a second routing table and using policy based routing (ip rule). Just a note, this is no different in my build than in any other OpenWrt version. This is done through Linux kernel mechanisms using iproute2, and generic documentation applies.</p><p>Here&#039;s an example I found quickly off google: <a href="http://blog.scottlowe.org/2013/05/29/a-quick-introduction-to-linux-policy-routing/">http://blog.scottlowe.org/2013/05/29/a- â€¦ y-routing/</a></p>									</div>
