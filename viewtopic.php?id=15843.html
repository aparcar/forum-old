					<p>all i can find on internet is [iwlist interface scan]. <br />it will list <br />wifi0 interface doesn&#039;t support scanning <br />wifi1 interface doesn&#039;t support scanning <br />while ath0 and ath1 can do the scanning<br />I know ath0 and ath1 are the interfaces of the wifi cards. but if i disabled wifi0, then iwlist scan redirect &quot;ath0&quot; to &quot;wifi&quot; instead of keeping &quot;ath1&quot; with &quot;wifi1&quot;. This is what i don&#039;t want. I hope I can get&nbsp; scanning result of wifi1 using iwlist ath1 scan at any case, no matter wifi is up or not.</p><p>so is there possibility to have iwlist DEV scan supported?. DEV refers to &quot;wifi0&quot; and &quot;wifi1&quot;?</p>									</div>
