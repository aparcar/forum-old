					<p>I played some with tcpdump last night. The bridge of course sees the announcements on the wired part, but doesn&#039;t forward them over the wireless network. I think that relayd just blocks those packets on purpose.</p><p>For iTunes and bonjour announcements there is a proxy program, so I can&#039;t see why this shouldn&#039;t work with upnp, too.</p><p>edit:<br />igmpproxy seems to do the trick.<br />This is my igmpproxy.conf:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>quickleave

phyint br-lan downstream ratelimit 0 threshold 1

phyint wlan0 upstream ratelimit 0 threshold 1
        altnet 192.168.1.0/24</code></pre></div><p>To make sure it works, I ran it in foreground like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>igmpproxy -d /etc/igmpproxy.conf</code></pre></div><p>It gave me output like:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>The origin for route 239.255.255.250 changed from 192.168.1.x to 192.168.1.y</code></pre></div><p>So I know it was receiving something. my whole network is on a 192.168.1.0/24 network, except for the WNDR3700 with is at 192.168.2.1 just like suggested in the relayd wireless bridge how-to.<br />I set the wndr3700 to static IP in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet. I added this IP to the network config so it&#039;s accessible in this network too. With igmpproxy in place it is now accessible from both sides of the bridge, which makes it seem work better.</p><p>I just set it up and tested it in the last hour, so it might not be perfect. But it&#039;s working at least. ymmv. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />I&#039;ll keep posting my experiences here. If this setup is stable, maybe it can be added to the relayd how-to.</p><p>edit2:<br />I can see ushare across the bridge, and some other stuff, so this seems to be fine.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fizze</strong> on 12 Jul 2011, 22:33)</p>

					<p>Glad to be helpful!<br />I&#039;m still not sure whether it&#039;s igmpproxy that is actually doing something, or whether it&#039;s relayd that suddenly works in broadcast mode. Anyway, it&#039;s still working for me, and has been stable for weeks.

					<p>Weird. I had a power outage and since the resulting forced reboot my upnp server cannot be seen across the wireless bridge either. I tried to mimic the setup, but to no avail.<br />The weird thing is that igmpproxy seems to translate packets from one side only. I tried it with relayd running in broadcast mode, and without. I need to investigate this some more, I&#039;m afraid.</p><p>@ hmm:<br />Any chance you can post details of your setup?<br />like &#039;ps auxw&#039; output, ifconfig, igmpproxy.conf and uci network config/firewall config dump?</p>									</div>

					<p>Sweet, thanks. Turns out my igmpproxy init script was broken.

					<p>The system log wont help you there.<br />Do as we did, and run igmpproxy in foreground to see its output.</p><p>AirportExpress uses Bonjour to announce itself, which is a little different from the UPnP broadcasts iirc.<br />You might also want to look into something called BonjourProxy or mDNS proxy. These programs can bridge DAAP/bonjour etc. between two networks, which is useful to tunnel DAAP through a VPN, for instance.</p>									</div>
