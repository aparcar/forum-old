					<p>So - I&#039;m not new to &#039;firmware&#039; but most of the other routers I&#039;ve used with either DD-WRT or Tomato.&nbsp; Lightning took out my Netgear, so, it&#039;s time for a new router.</p><p>The TP-Link Archer C2600 does not have a bad interface, no, it has a HORRIBLE one.<br />Hoping Open-WRT might have more options (like sorting on columns etc..) and higher information density than an OS that looks like it belongs on a tablet.</p><p>So - where does one find the OpenWRT firmware for this router?&nbsp; Your able guidance and assistance is appreciated, in advance.<br />Archer C2600 v1.0<br />Current Firmware 1.1.2 Build 20150924 Rel. 66045</p>									</div>
