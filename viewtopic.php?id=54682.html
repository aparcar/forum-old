					<p>Hi guys.<br />I have a FFTH 200/100 installed at my home office and since I started using OpenWRT I cannot get 200Mbps downloads anymore.<br />I have tested with the router provided by my ISP and the speeds are just fine: 214Mbps, but with OpenWRT the max I can get it&#039;s 100mbps.<br />The Switch page shows all ports at 1Gbps, the LAN interface at my desktop shows me the same.<br />I think I&#039;m using the last versions available:LuCI Trunk (0.12+svn-r10530) OpenWrt Barrier Breaker 14.07 <br />Any ideas?<br />Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks alphasparc for your response.<br />I don&#039;t have any QoS package installed, so I don&#039;t think that&#039;s the problem. I&#039;m just moved from pfSense looking for a lighter solution and save some power. I have 2 Wan Uplinks, which by the way was working flawlessly in pfSense for Wan Failover, after a lot of pain I gave up from multiwan in OpenWRT, maybe I&#039;m too noobish in OpenWRT world to deal with this. I don&#039;t think going back to pfSense it&#039;s a choice that&#039;s why I&#039;m trying to keep OpenWRT.<br />The problem I&#039;m having right now is not related with Multiwan package since it&#039;s uninstalled and I have just one WAN connected to the router.<br />I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s worth to mention, but my ISP connection is thru a tagged PPPOE, this could be impacting negatively on my speeds? <br />Another point is: Two computers connected to OpenWRT router switch reaches gigabit speeds transfering files between them, but none of them can go above 100mbps on WAN.<br />As I said before, with the router provided by my ISP I can go 214Mbps easily anytime.</p>									</div>

I had a lot...and I mean a LOT of stuff configured, DNS redirections, NAT rules and so on...AFAIK I can&#039;t restore a Barrier Breaker backup on Attitude Adjustment setup.<br />It will be a such pain to make this stuff all over again.<br />Thanks for the hint.</p>									</div>

					<p>There are some users trying Barrier Breaker backports to the solution used in Chaos Calmer.<br />Right now the only solutions to achieve full speed ( over 160Mb/s depending on the router ) using Openwrt are:<br />- a more powerfull hardware that overcame the limitation by brute force ( Ex. wdr4900 )<br />- use chaos calmer trunk ( not recomended since it&#039;s&nbsp; beta stage )<br />- use attitude adjustment ( 12.09 ) since it not suffer from this limitation<br />- watch the topic ( <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=51726">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=51726</a> ) to see if an stable backported solution is available to the WDR4300.

					<p>I&#039;m back and no dice <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" />.<br />Max WAN/LAN never go above 180Mbps with AA, it&#039;s better than BB transfer speeds but still disappointing.<br />I know we cannot expect that much from a consumer router using software NAT, maybe it&#039;s time to get hardware NAT<br />working on these little boxes like the manufacturers are doing these days, it&#039;s a matter of survival for OpenWRT I think.</p>									</div>

The symptom of the lack of horsepower is that the total transfer rates (uplink plus downlink if both are shaped) stay well below the configured limit. My own connection (50Mbps/10Mbps) is just within the limits of the wndr3700v2 I use, so I have the same problem you have in actually testing shaper performance.... <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have a look at the next to last plots in <a href="http://burntchrome.blogspot.de/2014/08/new-comcast-speeds-new-cerowrt-sqm.html">http://burntchrome.blogspot.de/2014/08/ … t-sqm.html</a> to get an idea how the shaping looks once the CPU is out of its comfort zone <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> (typically the router will spend most of its cycles on &quot;sirq&quot; or soft interrupts).</p><p>Hope that helps<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>

What transfers do you get?<br />I have one rack server 1.5u that I build for pfSense (i3 quad core 16GB RAM). I have tested a lot of OpenWRT x86 custom images but no one stable enough for use one day after another, the perfomance is sky high but it&#039;s not worth the risk, it&#039;s very experimental and really not optmized for x86 hardware. That&#039;s the reason I have moved from pfSense, which currently is pretty broken IMO, a lot of issues with 2.2. It crashes several times in a daily basis and the 2.1 is older...without support for new hardware.</p>									</div>
