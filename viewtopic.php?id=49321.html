					<p>I&#039;m trying to make this configuration : <a href="http://thejimmahknows.com/multiple-access-points-over-802-1q-using-openwrtpart1/">http://thejimmahknows.com/multiple-acce â€¦ nwrtpart1/</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; on a ubiquiti nanostation M2 loco with openwrt.<br />I noticed, unbelievably, that multi SSID is very easy to make work; but tagged vlans (802.1Q, which are a very common ethernet feature, are impossible to obtain.<br />I tried in Luci as described over there, without succes. I also tried changing manually /etc/config/network, but I only obtain errors when restarting network service.<br />I&#039;s a bit difficult to change /etc/config/network because I think there are different configuration according to the specific hardware in use, and I also think that Luci overwrites it.<br />Is there anyway to make vlan work in Openwrt as in AirOs and RouterOs?<br />Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>If i&#039;m understanding you correctly you want so connect your openwrt-router to a vlan-enabled switch via one tagged vlan port?!<br />If so, you want to do the same thing i did with my tp link wdr4300 and my dlink vlan switch.</p><p>I&#039;m guessing that (like mine) your router has only one network interface and an integrated vlan-switch; so you have to configure this integrated switch like you would when connecting two normal vlan-enabled switches with a tagged line.</p><p>Here&#039;s my /etc/config/network as an example:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># interface part as seen with ifconfig / ip a  l

					<p>Yes, mr fwb, my device is a nanostation loco M2 with atheros ar71xx and only one eth port. I think vlan has to work because with AirOs original firmware it works well with vlans. I don&#039;t understand the &quot; option ports &#039;0t 2 4 5&#039;&nbsp; &quot; command: how can I know wich are the port number used in nanostation (also the cpu port, I think)? And, the &quot; option vlan &#039;1&#039; &quot; is intended to use untagged lan packet on the same port used for tagged vlans? Or I need something different as &quot;veth&quot;? And, if I make a configuration similar to yours, what would be the behavior of Luci? Would it rewrite all the /etc/config/network file, or simply accept the configuration made and don&#039;t touch it?</p>									</div>
