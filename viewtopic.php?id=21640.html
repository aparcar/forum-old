					<p>OpenWrt and Software in the Public Interest (SPI) are pleased to announce an agreement to place OpenWrt under the SPI umbrella as an associated project. OpenWrt has hereby become a non-profit organization with the benefits this entails. OpenWrt joins such esteemed free and open source projects as Debian, PostgreSQL, OpenOffice.org, and madwifi.org. SPI makes a complete list of its associated projects available on its website.</p><p>Gregers Petersen, OpenWrt liaison to SPI, said: &quot;Becoming a member of SPI strengthens OpenWrt by defining us as a project rather than a group of individuals. OpenWrt chose to join SPI due to its strong position as legal entity,&nbsp; their purpose and goals are consistant with our views and OpenWrt alreadey had lasting relationships with several other SPI member projects. OpenWrt believes that collaboration is one of the forces which drives free software forward and extending the SPI umbrella is a manifestation of this&quot;</p><p>Jimmy Kaplowitz, SPI Secretary, said: &quot;We welcome OpenWrt into its new relationship with SPI. OpenWrt has a long history of enabling wireless networking equipment owners to have full control and flexibility to use their devices in countless ways. We look forward to supplying OpenWrt with the organizational assistance they need to flourish as a valuable free software project.&quot;</p><p>Further information about the OpenWrt project is found here: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org">https://dev.openwrt.org</a></p><p>Or visit the SPI website <a href="http://spi-inc.org">http://spi-inc.org</a>/</p>									</div>
