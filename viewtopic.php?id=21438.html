					<p>OK, I found the problem!<br />There are two different directories used when building a x386 system. The output from the builds is put into these two directory in two pieces. Parts on put into build_dir/linux-x386_generic and other parts are put into build_dir/x386. The root.ext2 is build with the parts in linux-x386_generic and dors not include the parts in build_dir/x386/.</p><p>I will open a bug for this.</p>									</div>
