					<p>Hi all,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I know this router is not in the hardware list, but I would like to use it as a WAN router without using the DSL component. So these are my findings:<br />- The soc is 63168&nbsp; should be supported per this wiki: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/soc/soc.broadcom.bcm63xx">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/s … om.bcm63xx</a><br />- I need to do a build from scratch as there&#039;s no availble openwrt image available for this SoC using this guide <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence</a></p><p> So these are my questions:<br />- When building the image, I don&#039;t see bcm63168 in the BCM63xx. So shoud I use BCM63xx or is there another way.</p><p>- I don&#039;t know where the JTAG component on MoB: I need it&nbsp; in order to check which loader it&#039;s using, check the harwdware settings and do the flash. explaining how we can do the connection will be appreciated as I&#039;m not very skilled in electronics.</p><p>- How do I know the flash layout</p><p>&nbsp; If needed, I can upload a picture of the MoB, but I don&#039;t know how.</p><br /><p>Regards,</p>									</div>

					<p>Just link an image from whichever host you&#039;d like (<a href="https://www.google.co.il/search?q=image+host">https://www.google.co.il/search?q=image+host</a>).</p><p>Also, jtag is mostly used on the assembly line for low level stuff like testing to see if everything is soldered properly. To find out what&#039;s the bootloader and what tftp settings are required, a 4pin serial port (vcc, rx, tx &amp; gnd) is far more common. If you are still looking for the jtag pin (holes?), you can usually tell them apart by the 10-100k pull-up resistors the jtag bus usually has.</p><p>By the way, I suspect most people working on this level have an EEPROM programmer with a good level converter and an appropriate (usually SOP 8 nowadays I think) clamp.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for answer and clarification.</p><p>I was able to add the picture of the MoB of the Smart RG SR630N and I would like some guidance in order to find where the PCB for the serial connection is located on this MoB and as I&#039;m not very skilled in electronics I&#039;ll appreciate also if you can provide me the steps to connect the 4pin serial to the MoB and how to build/have that 4pin serial.</p><p>If you need more pictures, don&#039;t hesitate to ask.</p><p>After some search I found the 4pin serial cables but I still missing where to plug it on my MoB: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/port.serial.cables">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/p … ial.cables</a></p><p>The picture is :<span class="postimg"><img src="http://s20.postimg.org/o0et8vrx9/IMG_3146.jpg" alt="http://s20.postimg.org/o0et8vrx9/IMG_3146.jpg" /></span></p><br /><p>Regards,</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>BENKHESA01</strong> on 2 Mar 2016, 22:02)</p>

					<p>The image is out of focus so I can&#039;t say for sure, but if those pins I outlined in red say rx \ tx \ vcc \ gnd then it should be it:</p><p><a href="http://postimg.org/image/x44yeb0eh/"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://s12.postimg.org/x44yeb0eh/IMG_3146.jpg" alt="http://s12.postimg.org/x44yeb0eh/IMG_3146.jpg" /></span></a></p><p>As for how to connect, this might help: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/port.serial">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/port.serial</a> </p><p>Since you&#039;re not going to build one for yourself, you might as well buy a serial-to-usb dongle like the wiki mentions. I mostly use a 2$ CP2104 (pcb labeled CNT-003) I bought off ebay.</p><p>Btw: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/tag/bcm63168?do=showtag&amp;tag=bcm63168">https://wiki.openwrt.org/tag/bcm63168?d … g=bcm63168</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, I&#039;d like to have an update on your work. How is the flashing going ?<br />I got a SR630N also and would love it more under openwrt, with VDSL support <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I tried playing with the SR505N gpl firmware, but can`t even get it compiling the kernel.</p>									</div>
