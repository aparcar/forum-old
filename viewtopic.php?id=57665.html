					<p>Hey everyone,</p><p>I have a Buffalo WZR-600DHP router running Barrier Breaker 14.07 r42625. It has 5 ethernet ports. eth0 is the WAN link and eth1 is the LAN link going to my unmanaged switch. The other 3 ports are free.</p><p>I also have a whitebox running FreeNAS. It has 3 NICs. I&#039;m intending for it to be a datastore for my VM hosts. Currently I only have one NIC in use. I see that I have the option of combining all 3 NICs using LACP, but that LACP also has to be configured on the switch. I&#039;m curious if I plugged all three NICs into eth2-4 on the Buffalo, is there some way I can configure LACP for those three ports on the Buffalo? I&#039;ve done some Googling but networking isn&#039;t one of my strengths. I may be totally off base. </p><p>I found this thread:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=34342">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=34342</a></p><p>I followed the linked guide (<a href="http://www.linuxhorizon.ro/bonding.html">http://www.linuxhorizon.ro/bonding.html</a>) but when I load the bonding module with mode=4, the module is already loaded. I assume it&#039;s loaded because eth1 and tap0/wlan0/wlan1 are bridged. </p><p>I also see that I&#039;m being told to give the bond an IP address. I think I&#039;m going down the wrong road - basically, does OpenWRT have the capability to configure LACP from the &quot;switch&quot;&#039;s point of view? Or do I just need to buy a managed switch that supports 802.3ad?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
