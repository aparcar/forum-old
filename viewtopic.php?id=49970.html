					<p>Hmm, the macvlan solution seems good. In this case I would be able to save two LAN ports -because the &quot;somewhere else&quot; to request the two public IP addresses is vital.</p><p>So the thing is: have two interfaces on the WAN port with macvlan. One acts like now- routes traffic to the LAN ports. With the macvlan setup it will route to only 3 LAN ports out of 4.<br />The second &quot;WAN&quot; interface has to be bridge, which pushes other two public dynamic IPs to the last 4th LAN port- and from here comes the cable (looong cable and wireless too) to two other clients.</p><p>Is that solution reliable? And one more thing- I have no idea, how to achieve it.<br />I have found this: <a href="http://www.bertera.it/index.php/2011/10/04/howto-configure-multiple-mac-address-over-a-single-ethernet-interface/">http://www.bertera.it/index.php/2011/10 … interface/</a><br />and this: <a href="http://www.huggill.com/2012/08/22/configuring-multiple-public-dhcp-ip-addresses-on-a-linksys-wrt54g-with-openwrt/">http://www.huggill.com/2012/08/22/confi … h-openwrt/</a><br />but I really do not know how actual it is.

					<p>You mean it&#039;s vital that &quot;somewhere else&quot; is getting the two remaining public IP addresses on its own? Or will one-to-one NAT&#039;ing from WR1043ND be just as good?<br />Do you aim at a topology where &quot;somewhere else&quot; with the two public IP addresses are separated from the router, IP layer wise? Each way has it advantages/disadvantages.</p><p>My initial thought was you could set up the WAN port with 3 MAC addresses and have a DHCP client running on each interface (the original + 2 macvlan) - thereby letting WR1043ND obtaining all three public IPs.<br />Then static leases for the two &quot;somewhere else&quot; which the public IPs were intended for. And then NAT&#039;ing between those two public IPs and the static leased LAN IPs.</p><p>By the way which hardware version of WR1043ND do you have? And are you running trunk or AA?</p>									</div>

					<p>Is it possible (and perhaps easier to configure/manage) if you reconfigure the vlans to move 2 of the switch ports from eth0.1 (lan) to eth0.2 (wan) so that the cable modem can then have a layer 2 path to those other ports?&nbsp; It raises the complexity of security, since you lose the ability to have OpenWRT doing all of your firewall management, but otherwise it would accomplish the desired functionality right?&nbsp; I am new to OpenWRT vlan management so if this isnt possible then i am wrong...</p><p>edit:<br />After looking at the graphic, you would accomplish this by changing one port to the WAN vlan, run that port to your secondary &quot;dumb switch&quot; and you should not need any other configuration in OpenWRT.&nbsp; And as one addendum to the security comment, you raise the security of your private LAN by not having those hosts on the same subnet at all so that is one advantage to the solution vs doing a DNAT and blanket port forwarding for whatever service they are going to provide.&nbsp; Be careful what you open to the internet!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jeffmeden</strong> on 15 Apr 2014, 21:01)</p>

					<p>I think you suggest creating second WAN port from LAN port, right? But there is one thing- the picture is not accurate. I have only one cable which goes from cable modem. So this one cable carries all 3 public IPs.</p>									</div>

					<p>Not exactly. Per default the switch in 1043ND is split 1 WAN and 4 LAN. You do make an extra WAN out of one of the labelled LAN ports as you say. But if you configure both the originally labelled WAN port and the extra to be in the same VLAN, you get a switch on the WAN side as well. If you then connect that extra WAN port (&quot;LAN4&quot;) to Client 1 and Client 2 (via long cable and &quot;dumb switch) they would be layer 2 connected all the way to your cable modem and able to request their own IPs.<br />No macvlan and extra bridging. Comparing to a vanilla configuration, the only thing you change is the &quot;config switch_vlan&quot; sections in network config file. Where you move one port from one VLAN to the other VLAN.</p>									</div>

					<p>Regarding improving speeds between clients1&amp;2 and the LAN of 1043.. My guess is that the 3 public IP addresses handed out by your ISP are not in the same subnet? Therefore e.g. &quot;client1&quot; never sends out ARP requests and learn that it&#039;s locally connected to 1043. One workaround would be to add an extra IP address to the WAN interfaces of 1043 and both &quot;clients&quot;. Private/rfc1918 addresses within the same small subnet, in a range not already in use. That should make &quot;clients&quot; send out ARP request to &quot;find&quot; 1043.<br />Or perhaps you might be able to release and renew your public IPs until you get some within the same subnet :-) maybe ask your ISP first to find out what the chances of success are.</p><br /><p>Are &quot;clients&quot; PCs or routers? If PCs, which OS?</p><p>Could you post what your obtain from ISP by DHCP (address, netmask, gateway) in both 1043 and one of the clients that can&#039;t connect to 1043 directly?</p><p>And the default unaltered routing tables in both 1043 and a Client (from the the same Client as above)?</p><p>You might want to conceal (e.g. substitute with letters) the left part of your public IPs, but in a manner that keeps the pattern between them.</p><br /><br /><p>Regarding QoS.. as the packets from Client1&amp;2 never pass through the 1043 (only its switch) I don&#039;t think you are left with any option for QoS.<br />So be aware in this setup Client1&amp;2 might be able to consume the complete Internet bandwidth unless the ISP is doing some kind of splitting between your public IPs.<br />If you need to gain some control of client1&amp;2 you might look into bridge/&quot;transparent&quot; firewalling or the macvlan+NAT combo.</p>									</div>

But remember to pay attention to whether the IPs change. Here&#039;s a convenient website where one can punch in the numbers to check if they belong to the same subnet, <a href="http://www.meridianoutpost.com/resources/etools/network/two-ips-on-same-network.php">http://www.meridianoutpost.com/resource … etwork.php</a></p><p>You can also try to add the IP aliases which should work despite of what your ISP is handing out.<br />If the PCs are running Linux or OS X it should be a simple matter.

					<p>Thank you for your suggestions. In fact that my ISP does not give me addresses on the same subnet, I will not do anything else, than what I have now (WAN switch), at least at the moment. It is not that important to spend another week studying network stuff which might work <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p>									</div>
