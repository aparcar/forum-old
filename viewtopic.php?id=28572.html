					<p>Hey guys,<br />tried a wap54g v3.1 with whiterussian. it worked fine, but then i made a wrong setting and now the wap has no ip adress and so i cant connect to it.<br />WLAN is active, i can connect to OpenWRT and lan is working fine, too but without a ip adress its senseless, cause i cant get it working like i want.<br />i tried the Failsafe mode :<br />-&gt; Took a UDP Broadcast listener and when it says &quot;Press Reset for Failsafe&quot; i pressed and hold the reset button - but nothing more happened, it booted like everytime and no failsafe mode (i tried press/unpress etc too - for 30 secs)</p><p>So now i dont know what to do. I read something about a serial console, but do not really understand what i have to do.</p><p>If someone has a solution, that would be really nice <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><br /><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
