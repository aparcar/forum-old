					<p>Hello,<br />I&#039;d like to configure port mirroring in a small TL-WR740N in which I&#039;ve installed CHAOS CALMER (15.05, r46767). <br />It uses an AR9331 and according the datasheet, this part seems to support the mirroring function. But &quot;swconfig&quot; seems not support this port option.<br />I browsed a bit and I haven&#039;t found a solution. I found (<a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/10202">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/10202</a>) that someone had the same problem -with a rtl8366rb device- and cooked its solution.<br />It seems it could be easy (?) do the same for the AR9331, but, frankly, it is a bit beyond my coding magic skills.<br />Well, if someone could tackle this issue it would be great... I think that port mirroring its an always interesting function :-)<br />Thank you and regards<br />Josep</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jmarro</strong> on 5 Jul 2016, 11:40)</p>

					<p>I think you can configure this feature by writing related registers directly.&nbsp; from the datasheet,&nbsp; address 0x0078 is the mirror port settting. 7:4 --- mirror port num.&nbsp; set the port you want to mirror. (It only support LAN port&#039;s mirror, 0 ~ 3). <br />Step2: enable ingress/egress on port control register. port 0, 0x0104.</p>									</div>
