					<p>Are you referring to: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Netgear/TelnetConsole">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har … netConsole</a>? This only discusses the telnet capabilities with stock firmware.<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware">http://wiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware</a> has it listed as &quot;untested&quot;<br />It seems possible though.

					<p>The WGR614 v6 is not supported.&nbsp; The entry in the table of hardware was added by someone who did not know what they were doing.&nbsp; The flash/ram values were listed in megabits, but they misinterpreted it as megabytes, which is what they noted on the wiki.&nbsp; It already has an entry on the Unsupported page with the proper values.&nbsp; 8MB of ram is too little to be a useful device running OpenWrt, and the kernel alone will barely fit on a 1MB flash chip; OpenWrt will not run on it.</p><p>Edit: fixed minor typo.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Bartman007</strong> on 5 Jun 2007, 10:26)</p>
