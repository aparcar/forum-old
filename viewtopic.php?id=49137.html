					<p>I just spent several days trying to get Avahi/Netatalk/usb/hfsplus to work. I already had the usb/hfsplus working well, but getting Avahi &amp; Netatalk to present my drive to a Mac&#039;s TimeMachine - and then actually getting consistent backups - has been an exercise in frustration. I must have tried just about every combination of settings possible but just couldn&#039;t get it going.</p><p>What finally got it working for me - big dumb grin here - was going back to the Time Capsule wiki and following it to the letter. Huh? But I tried that the first time... and no go. You can change your drive/volume/whatever names later, but for now just follow the wiki exactly.</p><p>Here are some subtle details that seem to make a big difference for me. NOTE: I am using a custom build of r39972 on ar71xx platform.</p><p>- avahi-daemon needs to be started AFTER afpd. OpenWrt boot sequence seems to handle this. But if you manually restart the services after making config changes, make sure you get the sequence right.<br />EDIT: This may not be true - it appears to have been an issue at one point, but I can&#039;t confirm it on my current setup.</p><p>- Avahi/Netatalk does indeed have shadow support, and you shouldn&#039;t have to install or tweek anything to enable it. Do download the user/group tools mentioned in the wiki, though.</p><p>- Your mounted volume needs to have appropriate privileges for the users/groups that Netatalk is associating with that volume. I think the wiki instructs thusly, but make sure you&#039;re setting privileges on the mounted volume and not just on the directory-mount-point.</p><p>- block mount and its associated tools are NOT working with hfsplus volumes. This bug may or may not be fixed in current trunk, but it does exist in at least r38987 thru r39972. Instead, use a simple mount command in /etc/rc.local.</p><p>- I didn&#039;t do anything with mDNS, and as far as I know, it&#039;s not even installed.</p><p>- My hfsplus/usb drive will go into read-only mode, if anything funky happens during access from Netatalk (of from any other remote mounting scheme). I&#039;m guessing this is a hfsplus-on-linux issue. You can use hfsplusprogs (separate download from github) to fix the drive directly on your OpenWrt router. Or, much faster, plug the drive into your Mac and use Disk Utility to repair. After this, you should have a fully read-write volume again. Note that various repair programs may report no problems with your drive, even if they do in fact fix the read-only issue. To prevent this problem, don&#039;t pull the plug in any way when TimeMachine is going a backup or when your afp volume is mounted on a remote device. Always use the appropriate tools to dismount/trash/put-away your remote volumes. If you are going to umount your volume on OpenWrt, first stop avahi-daemon and afpd.</p><p>- Something about my local network was preventing Avahi from completing it&#039;s startup. It looked like Avahi was trying to attach to ALL of my interfaces, so I restricted it by using the allow-interfaces=br-lan (server options in /etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf).</p><p>The good news is that it&#039;s all working smoothly now - I have multiple Macs backing up to my OpenWrt router via TimeMachine.</p><p>-----</p><p>EDIT: The hfsplus issue is becoming more of a problem. I have to do volume repair at least once a week, and occasionally I have to wipe the volume clean and start over with my backups. Kinda defeats the purpose of keeping historical snapshots with TimeMachine.</p><p>EDIT: More good news is that Avahi on OpenWrt does work with Tinc in router mode. Just make sure that your allow-interfaces (Avahi config option) includes your tincnet interface. Also enable allow-point-to-point (also Avahi config), as Tinc in routed mode is a point-to-point connection. Finally, enable Avahi reflection - that will let mdns traffic cross between your tincnet and your br-lan.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wbr</strong> on 28 Apr 2014, 02:22)</p>
