					<p>Greetings,</p><p>Today I was upgraded to gigabit speeds. When I plug my computer directly into the router/modem I get the full gigabit. When plugged into my AC1750 I&#039;m only getting 500 down/up and 100-200 through the 802.11AC.</p><p>What&#039;s going on? Can I fix it?</p><p>Thanks</p><p>EDIT: I&#039;m using OpenWrt SNAPSHOT r5973-1d9296d A post lede merge version of OpenWRT.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>7Priest7</strong> on 27 Mar 2018, 20:08)</p>

					<p>Routing at full 1 GBit/s line speed needs a correspondingly powerful router, ar71xx (like your Archer C7v2) can not do that. For a 1 GBit/s uplink I&#039;d seriously suggest x86, but mvebu or mt7621/ mt7622/ mt7623 might be able to cope as well (depending on your use case and the additional features you require from your router).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>slh</strong> on 27 Mar 2018, 22:41)</p>
