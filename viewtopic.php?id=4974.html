					<p>Hey I was wondering if anybody knows if WEP can be configured on kamikaze?&nbsp; I am having trouble finding any documentation on it and all the stuff on the OpenWrt documentation talks about is changing nvram variables which i know kamikaze doesn&#039;t use.&nbsp; Can anybody point me in the right direction?</p><p>Also, is it possible to use WDS to connect kamikaze to a wireless network that is using WEP?</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>I found mine here: <a href="http://openwrt.inf.fh-brs.de/~nbd/wgt-temp/">http://openwrt.inf.fh-brs.de/~nbd/wgt-temp/</a><br/>dd is a command in linux that splits up files, you would run that command from a linux box to split up the default netgear image into flashable chunks.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure it can be done from windows, but i don&#039;t know how.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks SpyderMan, you have helped me a lot.&nbsp; I have gotten my somewhat dead and almost round filed unit back to life.&nbsp; Don&#039;t know if I will keep it or not.&nbsp; At least I have learned a lot out of this, been some years ago that I use to trouble shoot units. Found myself really rusty.&nbsp; I found a quick way to bring them back using the CFE serial and activating the lan port via ifconfig.&nbsp; Worked for me anyway with just a few commands that I peiced together from here and there. </p><p>Thanks a bunch<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile"/></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Adrianlem</strong> on 27 Mar 2006, 09:48)</p>
