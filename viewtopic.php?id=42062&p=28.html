					<p>acognard, </p><p>Those trunk snapshots like you&#039;ve installed are rebuilt every day or two. While most of the packages are compatible between that builds, the packages including kernel modules are intentionally made incompatible for safety. So in order to install openvpn package (which includes a kmod) officially you can only use the package which was built at the same time as the firmware image you have flashed, opkg won&#039;t allow you to install a kmod package built today into openwrt system which was built a couple days ago. So when dealing with trunk you should either download all packages you&#039;re willing to install later at the same time when getting firmware image itself, or... in fact you can ignore that error.</p><p>If you&#039;re sure that kernel didn&#039;t change between the version you have installed and the current trunk, then you can force opkg to ignore dependencies check. See opkg --help for valid key to do that. In most cases it will work fine. It the worst case you will need to boot into failsafe mod and delete faulty kmod from the system.</p>									</div>

I&#039;ve been able to get it running for more than 5 days without reboot. (Most of the reboot is due to itchy fingers trying out configurations). With DD-WRT (May/June 2014 build), I couldn&#039;t get it to stay stable for more than 1 day at most.

					<p>acognard,</p><p>I understand you are confused - this is not so easy, and we all need to learn.</p><p>You have installed OpenWRT on WDR4900 - a router that is classified as Work in Progress (not supported), so you got yourself into a little situation. That is cool!</p><p>Since your router works right now, I suggest that you wait for Barrier Breaker to be &quot;final&quot;. I dont think it is more than a few weeks away (but I dont know). The final has the advantages:<br/> 1) It will be supported/available for years<br/> 2) It will come with the Web GUI (Luci) preinstalled, just as you want.</p><p>If you are more eager and upgrading your router feels urgent, I suggest you got to BB RC2. But then:<br/> 1) You should expect to upgrade soon again (as BB turns final)<br/> 2) You will need to install Web GUI (Luci) yourself (I provided a link a while ago)</p><p>The &quot;trunk&quot; changes all the time - avoid them unless you really know what you do. They are for people who want to test new versions of OpenWRT, not for people who primarily wants a router that works.</p><p>The fine image that you downloaded/installed was a completely unofficial image. That does not make it bad. But it is not the image you should rely on for production for the next months, rather something to just test on your router because at the moment it might provide advantages/save work, compared to trunk.</p>									</div>

My decision based on informations in this forum for its OpenWrt compatibality and the power it has. So i&#039;m not new in here but i had never registered to the forum.</p><p>Now i dropped the TP-Link OEM firmware and installed &quot;OpenWrt BarrierBreaker 14.07-rc3 generic&quot;. Worked without problems. You can follow all the essential configuration steps in the OpenWrt Wiki, they fully match to this version.</p><p>Here are my few cents about 14.07-rc3:<br/>- LuCI was integrated. So you&#039;ll have a fully working GUI after the first Login via telnet and changing your password there.<br/>- Very good basic configuration. Firewall blocks all, but not pings from WAN.<br/>- &#039;uhttpd-mod-tls&#039; package for HTTPS support wasn&#039;t installed<br/>- The WLAN 2,4GHz HT mode at 40 MHz doesn&#039;t work. Only HT 20 MHz. But i read this somewhere before in this forum.<br/>- WLAN 5 GHz latency and the throughput with HT 40MHz seems to be better than the stock OEM TP-Link firmware. But it&#039;s only a feeling.</p><p>I&#039;m really looking forward for the final release.</p><p>I had a problem with the opkg manager. I couldn&#039;t choose between builds for a package. For instance: luci-ssl has two builds (svn-r10472-1 and svn-r10467-1). Via terminal and LuCI GUI only the latest svn-r10472-1 was installed. I&#039;m quite new, may be i will figure this out. Can i choose a newer build without doubt?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Inno_A_Santana</strong> on 18 Aug 2014, 18:12)</p>

HT20 &amp; HT40 is switched forward and back. e.g.: When HT 40 is set, the standard is 20 MHz, when a connection is established and something is downloaded you should see that HT will switch from 20 MHz to 40 MHz. After a few seconds or after the download it will switch back to 20MHz.</p><p>But yes the 5GHz HT 20 &amp; 40 Mhz works like a charm. Tested on my Samsung Galaxy S4 mini and Dell Notebook with Intel 6230 WiFi Adapter.<br/>But 2,4 Ghz switching between HT 20 &amp; 40 Mhz does not work. When set HT to 40 MHz you&#039;ll see in LuCI that is show 20 MHz permanently and instead of a 150Mbit connection (single stream) I have only the half 75Mbit bandwith (single stream). <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm"/></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Inno_A_Santana</strong> on 20 Aug 2014, 12:22)</p>

					<p>Since I am confused about this HT20/HT40 thing with 2.4GHz/5Ghz, I decided to do some testing and put the results in a table.

# wifi
# wifi status</code></pre></div><p>If I got &quot;up&quot;:false I have given up that mode and written &quot;did not start&quot;.</p><p>Otherwise I have copied a 256Mb file from an Ubuntu Desktop, via a WDR4900, to two MacBooks.

client (receiving)
$ time nc 192.168.8.101 9999 | md5</code></pre></div><p>The resulting times are presented below.
