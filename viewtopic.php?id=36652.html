					<p>Hello,</p><p>so we&#039;re busy with soldering, tweaking, assimilating and such <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> ... while I simply wanted to connect my possibly nice sounding external midiman DAC to a network media player which would be controllable by upnp. Well, doesn&#039;t seem to be easy on a budget, S/PDIF coax &#039;out&#039; is rare, &#039;in&#039; even more.<br />Not that there wouldn&#039;t be a candidate for an output mod on the table, it&#039;s just not so tempting (asus hdp-r3, anyone?).</p><p>The ideal hardware (methinks) for this would include about the following:<br />much Hz, RAM &amp; Flash<br />Ethernet<br />USB<br />SATA<br />Wlan 802.11 a/b/g/n<br />Powerline (lan over electr. cables)<br />Audio codec with S/PDIF</p><p>Has anyone heard about a hardware project trying to accomplish something similar ?</p><p>For now I&#039;ll try an Alix1d to see how close it can get.<br />The &#039;Sheevaplug eSATA Development Kit&#039; looks interesting too.</p><p>greetings,</p><p>Chris</p>									</div>

					<p>I wanted to do such board. But was advised to go with Atheros instead of Broadcom SoC.</p><p>I planned for all you wrote except Audicodec. And wanted to add SDcard connector. minipciexpress that would have usb on it.<br />4port USB hub. And PCI express 1x port for custom hardware boards.</p>									</div>
