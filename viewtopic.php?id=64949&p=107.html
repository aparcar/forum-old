					<p>So I went back to LEDE on both my 1900AC v2 and 3200 ACM, everything seems fairly stable (to include the installed driver that was recently posted for the 3200) except for one thing. I can get my 1900 v2 to connect to my 3200 in client mode, but it doesn&#039;t want to pass traffic at all. I don&#039;t have this issue when I do this with my 1900 v2 to my 1900 v1. I have been trying to figure why this is for the better part of 6 weeks or so. Any ideas? Would this have to do with the rampant driver issues with mlwifi?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey David,</p><p>Any chance you could use <strong>dnsmasq-full</strong> by default instead of <strong>dnsmasq</strong>? I use DNSSEC with dnscrypt-proxy, so when I upgrade to a new image, DHCP et al breaks because of invalid options for the regular dnsmasq. The difference is size is pretty small, so I don&#039;t think it would be a big deal for those who are using one of our target Linksys routers.</p><p>Also, does anyone know the best way to upgrade when you use an external USB drive for <strong>/overlay</strong>? Some Googling led me to think you want to unmount it, flash, and then remount, but I&#039;m having a hard time conceptually understanding how that would work when I assume files on the USB drive would be at least partially incompatible with the new image. Any insight there?</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>timothyharrison2007 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>1)is there a build that addresses the wifi issues with the version 2 router ?

The wifi driver for 1900ACS has been working really well for me and seems to be mature enough to not worry much about catastrophic performance problems. Many of the recent driver updates have been aimed at getting the 3200ACM model in a better state, since that model has been having the most driver issues as of late. It&#039;s also true that Linksys jumped the gun by declaring these routers &quot;open source ready&quot; before their respective wifi drivers were fully functional on those open source platforms. I think others have noted that here and elsewhere. <br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>timothyharrison2007 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>2) is there any general advice apart from what&#039;s available in the wiki to help with my journey into openwrt.</p></blockquote></div><p>Other than these forums, I have found a lot of helpful resources all over the Internet from others using OpenWRT or LEDE that show you how to do almost anything. It really just depends on what you need/want out of your router.</p><br /><br /><p>Thanks as always!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>anymouse617</strong> on 15 Jul 2017, 18:49)</p>

There are 2 partitions, so when flashing LEDE from Factory, it writes to the 2nd partition, leaving the Factory Firmware in place. To go back to factory, just use the recovery method in the wiki. </p><p>As to the wifi driver, I also have the 1900acs, but is Version 1, but uses the same wifi driver as version 2. From what I understand the 2 are nearly identical except Version 2 has the Wifi power table on chip. </p><p>I&#039;ve found the 1900acs wifi to be quite good, and comparable to the factory driver, and IMHO is a little better in my environment. Your experience may differ as the environment has so much to do with performance. </p><p>So, for your journey, it&#039;s good you have experience, and are handy with SSH as it can help immensely. The first step is getting familiar with the LuCi Gui, and getting the configuration the way you want it. From there, ssh and look around at the directory structure and where the configuration files are.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davidc502</strong> on 15 Jul 2017, 18:54)</p>

The wifi driver for 1900ACS has been working really well for me and seems to be mature enough to not worry much about catastrophic performance problems</p></blockquote></div><p>Brilliant well im glad that you say it works well hopefully by tomorrow i will hav ea working openwrt router.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>It really just depends on what you need/want out of your router.</p></blockquote></div><p>Fortunately I don&#039;t need to do anything to impressive. Mainly its about securety,Flexibility and using opensource software. However I do want to use some custom scripts for presence detection on an OpenHab project.</p><p>&nbsp; </p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>As to the wifi driver, I also have the 1900acs, but is Version 1, but uses the same wifi driver as version 2. From what I understand the 2 are nearly identical except Version 2 has the Wifi power table on chip.</p><p>I&#039;ve found the 1900acs wifi to be quite good, and comparable to the factory driver, and IMHO is a little better in my environment. Your experience may differ as the environment has so much to do with performance.</p><p>So, for your journey, it&#039;s good you have experience, and are handy with SSH as it can help immensely. The first step is getting familiar with the LuCi Gui, and getting the configuration the way you want it. From there, ssh and look around at the directory structure and where the configuration files are.</p></blockquote></div><p>Thanks David &amp; anymouse617 for the welcome and the advice this has boosted my confidence about settting up the router tomorrow. I shall return for further advice if i stumble across any problems.</p>									</div>
