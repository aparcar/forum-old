					<p>Okay, before you decide that this is another paranoid topic let me first clarify what it is about.</p><p>I&#039;m sure the lot of you are aware of the recently released documents by Edward Snowden, and the wide scale of the NSA surveillance. I&#039;ve been reading the news online, and I came across these claims that it is quite easy to compromise embedded devices with outdated firmware. Most SOHO routers out there use factory firmware that is rarely updated by their users. So when new vulnerabilities are discovered these devices become a breeding ground for hackers, viruses, botnets, bitcoin miner malware, etc.</p><p>Recently I found out that my WiFi router had a backdoor build into its stock firmware, so I decided I&#039;m gonna wipe it clean and install a custom firmware instead. I&#039;ve used the Tomato firmware on my older WRT54GL routers that isn&#039;t applicable in my current case. DD-WRT seems like a mess, and there have been no stable releases for years. This leaves OpenWRT as a final choice, so I decided to give it a go. I&#039;ve never used OpenWRT ar a real router access point, so I&#039;m expecting to run into some trouble on the way.</p><p>Anyway, I was wondering about the firmware updates. It would seem that BB is currently in development, and a stable version release isn&#039;t planned for quite a while. AA is a stable release, but I&#039;ve read that it doesn&#039;t support my router. This pretty much leaves BB the only option. So technically what would be the recommended course of action right now? Suppose I install the trunk version of BB today, and that next month a new vulnerability is discovered and patched in one of the OpenWRT packages.</p><p>What mechanisms does OpenWRT have in place to update the affected packages and keep the device secure?</p>									</div>

					<p>Also see the explanation of the upgrade command of <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/opkg">OPKG package manager</a>, it explains when to upgrade packages and when to flash a new image.</p><p>You should also consider what you expose on the WAN side. If there is a vulnerability discovered in uhttpd, but you have only set it to listen on your local network, you don&#039;t have to worry unless you don&#039;t trust your local users.</p>									</div>

					<p>Regarding backdoors, the most secure option is to compile the firmware by yourself. As everything gets compiled directly from downloaded sources, you should be pretty safe regarding possible backdoors.</p><p>BB is usually rather stable, so you should select your device and the needed add-on packages and compile your own firmware. </p><p>Alternatively you can also install snapshot version of trunk, and then update it later if you feel the need for that.</p><br /><p>There is no &quot;push mechanism&quot; for prompting you install any new fixes.<br />With both alternatives it is upto you to install new versions.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 14 May 2014, 13:55)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the explanation.</p><p>So if I choose to use the pre-compiled image I can get the updates directly from the repository. And the program to perform the update would be OPKG (provided I have sufficient free space left to install the updates - afaik changes get written to a different flash partition that is then &quot;overlay&quot;-ed over the original).</p><p>Does OPKG use and/or verify openwrt package signatures before installing them?</p>									</div>

As the checksums are in a text file downloaded from the same directory as the package itself, a possible third party could easily replace the checksum of the package with the modified one.</p><p>Buildbot system compiles BB trunk snapshots daily from fresh sources and uploads them to the download directory, so all packages get overwritten daily. In that sense the risk of somebody changing packages in the trunk repository is small.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 14 May 2014, 15:54)</p>

					<p>OpenWrt packages, or their checksums, are not signed as far as I know.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>And the program to perform the update would be OPKG (provided I have sufficient free space left to install the updates - afaik changes get written to a different flash partition that is then &quot;overlay&quot;-ed over the original).</p></blockquote></div><p>And provided that the upgraded package is compatible with your older base system. In case of kernel upgrades you will probably always need to reflash, maybe also when important libraries (e.g. OpenSSL) are updated. When you upgrade a package which is included in your image (e.g. dnsmasq), the older version will remain in flash. Dnsmasq was updated to 2.70 today, if you flash a trunk image built before this you will have dnsmasq 2.66 in the image read-only SquashFS, and dnsmasq 2.70 in read-write JFFS2 (overlay) when you upgrade. If dnsmasq 2.71 is released later on, 2.70 is deleted from JFFS2 because that&#039;s writable, but 2.66 will still remain in SquashFS.</p>									</div>

					<p>I understand. The text file with hashes could be signed at the very least to have some basic chain of trust. ^^</p><p>Anyway what is the recommended update procedure? Shall I just compile everything from source? What happens to the 3rd party packages and the configuration after I upgrade? I take it everything has to be done from scratch.</p><p>Regards!</p>									</div>
