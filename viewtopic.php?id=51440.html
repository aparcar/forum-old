					<p>I&#039;m wondering if anyone is working on support for the router i see there support for the older versions of it.( <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/asus/wl-330n">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/asus/wl-330n</a> ) Also maybe this is one of those thing where if you have to ask then you aren&#039;t ready but i searched for a while today and i didn&#039;t see anything about how to build an image that would support this router. It uses Ralink which the supported devices page says is easier to support.</p>									</div>
