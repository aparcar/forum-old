					<p>Dear all,</p><p>I have been googling quite a bit in this regard, but so far haven&#039;t find anything.</p><p>What I am interested in is if its possible to use higher than 1500byte MTU on the TUN interface of OpenVPN? Of corse OpenVPN can concatenate transparently, but it should be able to pass 1600byte packets over the tunnel.</p><p>I am trying to carry IP traffic which has GTP-U tunneling on top, that means the 1500byte is definitely not enough.</p><p>Or if it is not possible with OVPN, is it with some other tunneling technique (which works over the internet)?</p><p>Thanks for the answer!</p><p>Dchard</p>									</div>

					<p>I try again, maybe some has an idea how to achieve higher than 1500 byte MTU with layer 3 tunneling.</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Dchard</p>									</div>
