					<p>I am interested in running OpenWrt on my Netgear WG602 wireless access point, so I&#039;ve been trying to find out more about it. I&#039;ve created an <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Netgear/WG602v1">entry on the OpenWrt wiki</a>, based on other sources on the web ( <a href="http://www.seattlewireless.net/NetgearWG602">http://www.seattlewireless.net/NetgearWG602</a> and <a href="http://kbserver.netgear.com/products/WG602v1.asp">http://kbserver.netgear.com/products/WG602v1.asp</a> among them) and my own fiddling.</p><p>I&#039;ve been trying to put the precompiled OpenWrt .trx firmware images onto the device without succes. I&#039;ve tried, in a spririt of newbie-ish experimentation/optimism, copying various lengths of the header from the official firmware to a WhiteRussian release of OpenWrt, which has at least been written to flash, but predictably made a brick of my WG602 (as detailed in the wiki entry, it&#039;s easily recoverable)</p><p>The current version of the official Netgear firmware at time of writing is <a href="ftp://downloads.netgear.com/files/wg602_v1715.zip">1.7.15</a> available from <a href="http://kbserver.netgear.com/support_details.asp?dnldID=741">http://kbserver.netgear.com/support_det â€¦ dnldID=741</a><br />Previous versions had a telnet interface, but this was removed for security reasons. Portscanning with nmap reveals that the current version has only a web-based UI, and an ftp server (vsftpd) which gives access to the entire OpenRG FS, however many files are not viewable, and none seem writable. I&#039;m currently not sure of the purpose of this ftp service, certainly it does not *appear* to offer any facility for uploading custom firmware versions.</p><p>I&#039;m making this post in the hope of encouraging discussion among other people with this device.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Norky</strong> on 21 Feb 2006, 22:06)</p>
