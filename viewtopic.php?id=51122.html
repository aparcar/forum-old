					<p>The version string was updated from 12.09-rc1 to 12.09 in <a href="http://git.openwrt.org/?p=12.09/openwrt.git;a=commit;h=aece8a0ff19daed77fd2dc435e4bfd5a65e6d76e">r36420</a>. I suppose it&#039;s defined manually when they do a release build or something, don&#039;t know how the release engineering works. If you are trying to create an authentic r36088, create a patch based on r36420 to update your version string, or change the one line affected.</p><p>Unless you are doing some historical reconstruction, I&#039;d suggest checking out the latest AA instead. Has plenty of fixes since release.</p>									</div>

					<p>I can see where you&#039;re coming from, but I don&#039;t agree with your conclusion that building AA from the most recent revision has any particular advantages over picking today&#039;s BB trunk and building from that. Unless AA 12.09.1 gets frozen at one revision, which I don&#039;t see coming and honestly don&#039;t even expect anymore, it is in the same state of &quot;get a revision, commit to it&quot; as BB. It&#039;s not like a possible future &quot;stable&quot; AA will be able to play well with what you did in your intermediate revision&#039;s build, you might as well place your bet on BB.

					<p>metai<br />I see what you mean.</p><p>I guess I am trying to achieve two things : </p><p>- First to make a firmware build that works functionally, and </p><p>- Second to have a repeatable process that allows anyone else to make that same build of the product, while adding in their own customisations.</p><p>As I best understand, if the checkout and packages revisions aren&#039;t specified explicitly, then each time the build environment gets set up it will be different, and the resulting firmware is likely to behave differently.
