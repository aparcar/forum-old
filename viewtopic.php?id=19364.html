					<p>hi there.<br />i have some wireless performance problems with my fonera. it is connected as client to a wireless network.<br />i also have an yagi antenna on the fonera. with this i get an download of only 40-60kbyte/s and an upload of 200-300kbyte/s<br />The LinkQualitiy is with the yagi mostly about 28/70<br />with an omni antenna it is about 18-20/70. But sometimes it gives much higher download rates than with the yagi.<br />when i put my laptop to the same place where the yagi is and connect it wirelessly to the desired network, the performance is mostly as it should be: 1-1,5 megabyte/sec</p><p>i dont know why ?! <br />thanks for your help</p>									</div>
