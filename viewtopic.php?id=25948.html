					<p>Greetings, and apologies if this question is mis-categorized or otherwise foolish (I did search for answers, but I thought I&#039;d ask as well).</p><p>I&#039;ve been given a Clear Spot 4G to play around with (<a href="http://www.clear.com/spot/4g">http://www.clear.com/spot/4g</a>) and after a teardown (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mjbraun/sets/72157624514193685/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/mjbraun/se â€¦ 514193685/</a>) of the device I see that under the hood it has an Atheros AR2317 chip onboard. The device provides wifi connectivity to up to 8 users and connects via Clear&#039;s 4G network. I see from this discussion here: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=15491">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=15491</a> that the Atheros AR2317 is supported, and the device is managed via a web-based interface (there is also something living on port 2002, but I&#039;m not sure what that is yet), so at first glance, getting OpenWRT on this thing appears possible. </p><p>I was wondering if, besides reading-reading-reading (which I&#039;m doing), there are any first steps that I should be taking to see if OpenWRT can live on this device? Or if anyone has any suggestions for courses of action?</p><p>Thanks for your guidance and assistance!</p>									</div>

					<p>I forgot to mention: the device uses a <a href="http://www.gctsemi.com/html/4GBroadband.html">GCT chip</a> and the source for the modified Linux kernel used by the device is <a href="http://www.infomark.co.kr/oss/down.html">available for download</a>. Per the <a href="http://www.infomark.co.kr/oss/down/mod_dir.txt">&quot;Modified Directory List&quot;</a> posted on Infomark&#039;s site, the changes to the kernel were made in the following directories: <br />arch/arm/<br />arch/arm/boot/compressed/<br />arch/arm/kernel/<br />arch/arm/mm/<br />drivers/char/<br />drivers/i2c/busses/<br />drivers/mtd/chips/<br />drivers/net/<br />drivers/net/wimax<br />drivers/net/wireless<br />drivers/serial/<br />drivers/usb/gadget/<br />include/asm-arm/<br />include/asm-arm/arch-vincent7/<br />include/linux/<br />include/net/<br />mm/<br />net/core/<br />net/ipv4/<br />arch/arm/mach-vincent/</p><p>This seems rather promising.

					<p>Hey there,</p><p>Going to get a lot of heat for resurrecting this thread I&#039;m sure, and being totally fresh to this scene, but wondering if anyone out there has any idea about anything related to getting an open firmware such as OpenWRT on a mobile broadband enabled device like those from Clear (Clear Spot 4G, Clear Hub Express). I&#039;ve got a project that has a requirement for this, and absolutely any shred of information would be helpful at this point -- even if it&#039;s very high level (e.g. how in theory I might be able to get this to work and what steps I might take). If there is a better resource for this than asking in this forum, please point me in that direction. I am at a loss at finding data on this right now -- and perhaps for a good reason, which explained would also be helpful to me :)</p><p>Thank you so so much for your patience and wisdom,<br />Ryan</p>									</div>

					<p>Not certain that this will help .... but</p><p>From the OpenWRT.org home page you can click on the Wiki tab. From there you will see several useful links including one for beginners. Follow that one ....</p><p>How are you supposed to know that clicking on the Wiki tab is best for newcomers ? <br />A. Beats me ! ;-)<br />I&#039;ve tried to get a line added.</p>									</div>
