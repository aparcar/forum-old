					<p>Well, Can I just disable some services/packages from OpenWRT to free some space or some like that?.... OH and.... since the process for installing OpenWRT is based on that Dlink Dir-300 has the original firmware, but it is not, It has some ddwrt, how can I install openwrt?</p>									</div>

					<p>You cannot uninstall packages that come with a build. They are baked into the compressed SquashFS image. &quot;Uninstalling&quot; only marks them as deleted but does not free up the actual space. The only way to not have them take up space on the flash is by creating a custom image that doesn&#039;t include them in the first place.</p><p>/tmp/ is a &quot;ramdisk&quot; and exists only in memory.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 28 Jul 2014, 00:37)</p>

					<p>Hello.</p><p>I used version 8.09.2 on DIR-300 A1 and it was very good on this router.<br />10.03.1 and 12.09 very hard for it.<br />I thought that if I remove a few packages of luci which I don&#039;t need web interface will run faster.<br />And it was my fatal mistake. When I tryed to upgrade firmware from 8.09.2 to 12.09 something went wrong and now my router doesn&#039;t work.</p><p>I want to telnet in Micro Redboot at 192.168.1.1 but I don&#039;t have access.<br />I read <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Micro_Redboot">wiki</a>.
