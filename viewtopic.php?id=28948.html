					<p>Hi guys, <br />I&#039;ve tried to get DD-WRT into my router TP-Link WR741ND v1.0 and first it seems I was successful. However after 5min I can&#039;t connect to device and the only one thing, that helps, was 30/30/30 restart ( only for next 5min <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /> ). So I restored original firmware and tried to flash OpenWDT. And now I can&#039;t connect to the device - I get no ping (POWER and connected-LAN LEDs light - but they aren&#039;t flashing). </p><p>Is there any possibility to unbrick router? I&#039;ve read something about &quot;Nokia CA-42&quot;, but it it really necessary to use this cable? Can I use USB-&gt;MiniUSB cable? There are 4 cords (Green,Red,White,Black). Should I connect it the same way as on this picture <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/_media/toh/tp-link/wr741nd-10-serial-reverse-side.jpg?w=700">http://wiki.openwrt.org/_media/toh/tp-l … .jpg?w=700</a> ? And should I use some resistors? </p><p>And what&#039;s the next step after creating a cable? </p><p>Really thanks a lot for your help. </p><p>Erlandis</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank.<br />That mean, that I can&#039;t use any kind of cable. But I found this one: MA-8620E. Can I use it instead of CA-42? They&#039;re officially supporting the same phones so they should be almost the same, aren&#039;t they?<br />--------<br />And now I found where do I mistake by flashing. There was V1.0 in WEB API, but while I open the cover, there was written V 1.9 <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /><br />And in V1.9 is another flash chip: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr741nd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr741nd</a> ... So if I use next time &quot;Backfire 10.03.1rc4&quot; instead of &quot;Backfire 10.03&quot; it will probably work?</p><p>Edit: Of course - Failsafe mode isn&#039;t working (I&#039;ve tried many times...no ping)<br />MA-8620E could be DKU-5? Then there is no problem to use it, or? <a href="http://buffalo.nas-central.org/index.php/Use_a_Nokia_Serial_Cable_on_an_ARM9_Linkstation">http://buffalo.nas-central.org/index.ph … inkstation</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Erlandis</strong> on 11 Mar 2011, 23:33)</p>
