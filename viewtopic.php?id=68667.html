					<p>Ok Thank you. Here is the detailed requirement. </p><p>For regulatory purposes in a country ( Iran ) we need two firmware for Gateworks Avila 2348-4L and ADI engineering pronghorn 210 and 250 which are also the same platform . I will send you the data sheets.</p><p>Firmware number one :</p><p>1- a slight change in the GUI appearance. ( I will discuss more in the email )</p><br /><p>Firmware number two :</p><p>1- same slight change in the GUI appearance as mentioned in number one.<br />2- regulatory domain country to be fixed to Iran. and no other country should be available as an option. So the wireless channels available will only be 5745 to 5825.<br />3- The firmware upgrade option in the software should be removed. <br />4- These changes should not be gone by applying reset factory of course.<br />5- With a secret keyboard combination the upgrade button appear.</p><p>* How much more will this cost if we want this for another platform ?</p><p>For budget please contact me.</p><p>peter.blumstein@excelnetworks,com</p><p>Thank you</p>									</div>
