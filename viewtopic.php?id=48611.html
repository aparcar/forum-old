					<p>I&#039;m using Attitude Adjustment and noticed that a procedure on the wiki (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.sysupgrade#luci.web.upgrade.process">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/gener â€¦ de.process</a>) is slightly different in Attitude Adjustment.</p><p>How should the difference be shown?<br />e.g. in this case I have updated it for the changes in LuCI page layouts and included previous version and Attitude Adjustment suffixes on each line. Is this a good way to do it? Or maybe repeat the whole procedure for both versions or should the Wiki only document the latest release?</p><p>Thanks<br />Adrian</p>									</div>

					<p>Just use your best judgement. I would rename current page to something like &quot;generic.sysupgrade.backfire&quot; and copy content to original page name &quot;generic.sysupgrade&quot; and then update current page and link to older version for those who still need it.</p><p>But you are free to experiment and report back here on the forum.</p>									</div>
