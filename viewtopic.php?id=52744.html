					<p>Maybe a dedicated wireless USB print server would be easier/better. Here&#039;s one, although given the price you&#039;re almost better off buying a new printer.</p><p><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833162084&amp;ignorebbr=1">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.a â€¦ gnorebbr=1</a></p><p>There are cheaper wired options.</p><p>One last option is to use a cheap pogoplug as a print server.

					<p>Thank you,draws.It&#039;s really a problem of cups.I install cups on centos,and also select raw,then I got the same result:job completed,printer did nothing...But when I installed foo2zjs printer driver,I can print from any computer perfectly.So,it seems that I should install the printer driver on my OpenWRT device,but it may be difficult to cross-compile the driver to a router...<br />I installed p910nd on OpenWRT device,it works well if I print from Linux or other UNIX like OS,but when I print from Windows,I will get many copys in one print job...system log shows p910nd received the print job many times.I don&#039;t know if anyone meets the same problem,but for Linux users it&#039;s really a small and efficient solution.</p>									</div>
