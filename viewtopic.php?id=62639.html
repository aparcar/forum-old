					<p>I made some progress. I have the server working. It receives mail from an smtp server. But after receiving one message emailrelay exits with a segmentation fault.</p><p>In fact, emailrelay seems to crash every time it needs to disconnect. Also in client mode and in POP mode.</p><p>In POP mode I see the message received in Thunderbird with the Fetch header only option enabled. With this option disabled Thunderbird starts downloading the message and continues to do so until you abort it manually. The Inbox grows and grows with just CRLF characters.</p><p>The reason is that emailrelay seems to be unable to disconnect and if the peer does, it crashes with a segmentation fault.</p><p>I built a wrapper script as a work around so that I can use it as a server. But I think a developer should have a look into this issue or remove the feed and add it to &quot;oldpackages&quot; meanwhile.</p>									</div>
