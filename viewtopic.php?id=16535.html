					<p>First let me tell you what happened...</p><p>I was messing with ddwrt and overclocked it to 300mhz (just playing around) and it bricked (flashing power light).&nbsp; I was able to do the 30/30/30 to get it back and I overclocked it again, working my way up to 28x before it bricked again.&nbsp; This time the 30/30/30 trick would not work.&nbsp; I tried shorting the pins on the flash and that wouldn&#039;t work.&nbsp; At this point I had this...<br />1. flashing power light<br />2. no dmz light<br />3. ping failure<br />4. web gui failure</p><p>I used a JTAG cable and flashed and then using TFTP uploaded the original Linksys firmware (using Knoppix) and even ddwrt-mini.</p><p>Now ping works but no web gui.&nbsp; &nbsp;I still have blinking power light and now the dmz light is blinking (4 sec on/4 sec off).&nbsp; It seems everything I try acts like it is working but I can&#039;t get the web gui or telnet to work.</p><p>Any suggestions, I&#039;m going to try Openwrt and Tomato tonight...</p>									</div>

					<p>Pin shorting is VERY bad only use that as a last resort, what router model is that, if memory serves me, with the linksys wrt54g(s) 1-4 if you get a ttl of 100 for the pings you are talking to the CFE not whatever firmware image you uploaded.&nbsp; If you can get the model number someone may be able to help you more.</p>									</div>
