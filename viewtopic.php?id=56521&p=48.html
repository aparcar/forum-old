					<p>@tmo26 - thanks for updating the top page of the wiki to remove the &quot;Under Construction&quot; banner. </p><p>Thanks, too for decreasing the length of the top-note on the ToH. It&#039;s still too long though, because the table is barely visible in some screens (see <a href="http://picpaste.com/ToH-partial_screen_1.png">http://picpaste.com/ToH-partial_screen_1.png</a> for what it looks like - I never run full-screen.) Perhaps the table could be &lt;WRAP right 650px&gt; ... &lt;/WRAP&gt;</p><p>I also really liked the &lt;color black/white&gt;&#039;&#039; white fields &#039;&#039;&lt;/color&gt; to emphasize where the filter criteria should be entered.</p>									</div>

If you take out a value from the dropdowns, this value is suddenly not valid any longer, hence not being displayed any more, although still available in the wikisource.</p><p>=&gt; Deleting/changing valid values for dropdowns needs to be coordinated with the affected dataentries, i.e. first change the valid values (wiki admin area -&gt; my job), then update the dataentries. Since the latter is quite a bit of work (624 devices alone with instructionset = MIPS), I suggest to do this as a batch update, like the initial upload.</p><br /><p>Please comment on the above proposal, if it is correct, and if we should implement it like shown above.</p>									</div>
