You&#039;re still completely missing the point. There are a lot of images of that particular skyline, sure. Quite a few of them probably taken within a few metres of where I parked my tripod for that shot. Do you have any idea how any of those images you linked to are licenced, though? Unless specifically stated otherwise, you can only really assume that you have no right whatsoever to reproduce them, in any form.

					<p>@johndoe:<br/>I&#039;m sorry to say this, but if you look close (on the old skyline) you will see without *any* doubt, that the base image was the foto from stibbons. You could even prove it by taking both pictures to Photoshop, scale and adjust them so that they fit on top of each other and switch one of the layer modes to &quot;Difference&quot;.<br/>I didn&#039;t do this yet because in general in photos there are several &#039;landmarks&#039; which are absolutely unmistakable. And if you find those landmarks in two images, nonetheless how much editing there was going on, you can clearly say that there is a connection. Which absolutely is the case with stibbons pic and mbm&#039;s pic.</p><p>So, no SCO vs. IBM here.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cyphem</strong> on 3 Jul 2006, 13:23)</p>
