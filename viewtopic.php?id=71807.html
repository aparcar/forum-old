I contribute there frequently and have both created new pages, made minor edits, and nearly completely overhauled others. Just create a wiki account and make some minor edits here and there (like misspellings, grammar, etc.) until you get comfortable with it. Then start putting in&nbsp; the new sections that you think would be helpful. Take a look at other wiki pages like the WNDR3700 wiki as reference. I would avoid flat-out deleting sections unless you are very familiar with the hardware and software. Just move them down the page or label them as legacy or something.</p>									</div>
