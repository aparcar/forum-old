					<p>Don&#039;t mean to derail the conversation, but I&#039;ve recently bought two WRT1900ACS routers for my home and david&#039;s firmware saved my bacon after the instability and slow speeds of OpenWRT&#039;s release firmware. I flashed the version posted on 5-12 but I noticed there is already another one up. Should I reflash my two routers or should I just stick with what I currently have if it seems to work flawlessly 96-99% of the time? How often are new builds uploaded and are they all relatively stable?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dylanweber</strong> on 22 May 2017, 12:21)</p>

					<p>@Starcms how close were you to the router when you performed those iperf tests? Also I tried David&#039;s 5/12 build but I ran into that same problem where my requests would go in slow (websites stalled and took long to load) But this router is in a place where where is 30 wireless N networks and 10-15 AC networks. The number would be smaller if it weren&#039;t for xfinitywifi and blank SSID&#039;s. I&#039;m assuming the only reason why most of the people in my area have wireless AC is because Comcast provided to them, HOME-XXXX bloat everywhere.</p>									</div>

Issue is, if you do a sysupgrade from within LEDE you will overwrite the Linksys partition with LEDE and have lost the Linksys firmware. I always keep the Linksys firmware as I try multiple different firmware, LEDE, Openwrt, DD-WRT, and Gargoyle. Couldn&#039;t do that if the Linksys firmware is gone. <br />Keep in mind that Linksys built in a safety net of sorts. A install/update always goes to the inactive partition, giving you a way back to a good firmware should the install go badly.</p>									</div>

					<p>Considering you have a 1,000/100 Mbps connection, the 1st result from the DSLReport test is not bad. I have a 1/1 Gbps connection and the DSLReport resulted with an average of 400/970 Mbps connection. With the link you provided, the result is about 150/600 Mbps connection. In both tests, they used local (nearby AT&amp;T) servers.</p>									</div>

					<p>@david , do you happen to have a previous release for Shelby available for download?

I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s some change in the latest build, or something else I&#039;ve messed up during the upgrade ( I&#039;ve installed some rules in the firewall, but that wouldn&#039;t justify a drop from 40 mbits to 8 mbits in iperf3 at 20 feet ). </p><p>Thanks in advance!</p><p>*EDIT* : Forget about this... I&#039;ve tried downloading the official LEDE 17.1 and the problem persists, it&#039;s not your new build <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> I&#039;ll keep digging</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mariano.silva</strong> on 23 May 2017, 07:24)</p>
