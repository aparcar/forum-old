					<p>Can anyone help here? I am also having this problem with 15.05.1! I did the same thing - trying older images, changing the config.txt files, but it always just stays at the rainbow screen. Does the same thing on both my Raspberry Pi 2 and RPi 3. </p><p>I tried some stuff like adding boot flags to the partitions, and installing just the files to a known working Raspbian image, but to no avail. Can anyone helps us fix this? Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>In my experience, the &quot;rainbow screen of death&quot; happens when the device cannot boot from the card. How do you install OpenWrt on the card?</p>									</div>
