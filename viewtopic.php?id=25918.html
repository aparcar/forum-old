					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have a Dlink DIR-825 (Rev. B1, if it matters) and I need to set a port to fixed 10BaseT half-duplex so I can connect an old device which is failing autonegotiation (the interesting part is that, with stock DLink firmware, the autonegotiation apparently works, as the device works with no problems whatsoever).</p><p>I&#039;ve searched both this forum and Google for a solution, to no avail.</p><p>What I&#039;ve been able to figure is that, as the port is on the internal switch, swconfig should be used for its configuration, but for the life of me I can&#039;t figure out the command for that.</p><p>swconfig shows the port as being not connected, even though the device is plugged and the &quot;connected&quot; LED on the device itself is lighted:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;root@OpenWrt:~# swconfig dev rtl8366s show<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [...]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Port 0:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;link: port:0 link: down</p><p>I&#039;ve digged into &quot;swconfig help&quot; and &quot;swconfig dev rtl8366s port 0 help&quot; for a solution, and the closest I&#039;ve been able to get was:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;root@OpenWrt:~# swconfig dev rtl8366s port 0 set link &quot;link:up speed:10baseT half-duplex&quot;</p><p>which of course only prints &quot;failed&quot;.</p><p>Does anyone know how to do this on OpenWRT? For the record, I&#039;ve tried both with Backfire 10.03 stable (dated 2010/04/06) and with the latest trunk snapshot (dated 2010/07/29), with exactly the same results.</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br />-- <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Durval Menezes.</p>									</div>
