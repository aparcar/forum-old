					<p>Hey,</p><p>I&#039;m looking to set up a specific network configuration. I&#039;m looking to expose an iPhone to the internet to collect attack data similar to a honeypot but I looking for some advise on wether OpenWRT is the way to go to obtain this objective or not. My understanding of the network configuration was to use a wireless bridge to assign a public address to the iPhone. I am hoping that the bridge would act transparent between the DSL interface and the wireless interface. By placing the AP into ad-hoc mode, I could associate the iPhone with the AP and then span traffic to a third interface as a network tap to collect all (unencrypted) data flowing through the AP to the iPhone. </p><p>My other approach was to build a bridge using a unix box but a friend suggested OpenWRT. Can OpenWRT do this and does anyone have any information (links, tutorials etc) on how I&#039;d go about it if so?</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>A</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>abnev</strong> on 19 Jun 2010, 20:40)</p>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>why do you want to put the AP into Ad-Hoc mode? You can just bridge the AP too...<br />Whether you can or cannot spawn multiple interfaces depends on the device and driver.</p><p>You can basically use an OpenWrt supported device, hook the DSL to one of the <strong>LAN</strong> ports and enable wireless.<br />The you can login to the OpenWrt system and run tcpdump etc. on the br-lan bridge which conntects wifi with the ethernet switch.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey jow,</p><p>Thanks for the quick reply. I see your point in simplifying it. However, when you say &quot;br-lan bridge which connects wifi with the ehternet switch&quot;, I assume you mean &#039;bridge the DSL and wifi interfaces&#039;? Do you have any reference material in relation to setting up such a bridge or can it be done through the web interface easily enough? I may dig out an old Linksys and see if I can get OpenWRT installed this evening.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>A</p>									</div>
