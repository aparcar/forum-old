					<p>First, you should have a look at the wiki page: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/port.serial#serial.port.pinouts">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/po â€¦ rt.pinouts</a><br />Then, you should write in detail what you already did, and the results you encountered.<br />Something you could do for a start is an echo test. Therefor you make sure that local echo is disabled in your terminal program (don&#039;t connect any line of your serial cable and type something in the terminal program - what you typed should not appear on the screen). Then, you connect your serial cables Tx with your serial cables Rx and type something - you should get what you typed printed on the screen.</p>									</div>
