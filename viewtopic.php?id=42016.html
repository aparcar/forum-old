					<p>Hi, I got a TP-Link WDR3600 v1.1 today and wanted to put OpenWRT onto it. Now I have a bricked device (wlan is up but wrongly configured, and I cannot ssh/telnet/webclient..., lan is also broken in whatever manner and I cannot reach anything) and I am unable to get it working again. Here is what I did to brick it:</p><p>- I went to <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr3600">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr3600</a> and was unable to find a firmware image download there, so I googled<br />- I came across <a href="http://www.ip-phone-forum.de/showthread.php?t=252378">http://www.ip-phone-forum.de/showthread.php?t=252378</a> which brought me to the image file <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09-beta/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wdr3600-v1-squashfs-factory.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_a … actory.bin</a> which I &quot;upgraded&quot; to using the TP-Link standard interface<br />- I installed luci using openkg according to <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials</a><br />- I poked a bit around the luci web interface, found wifi settings and added a WLAN-PSK2 wifi with &quot;automatic&quot; encryption, a password and using the 2.4Ghz wlan interface<br />- I succesfully connected to the wlan with my laptop, but noticed that I was now having the WAN ip (the ip the router uses to connect to the internet itself) and assumed DHCP was broken or not running<br />- I went to the luci dhcp options and checked, but there was no way to specify whether the dhcp should run on wifi or not. It ran fine on LAN, so I assumed it was probably not configured to run on Wifi. I googled...<br />- I looked at this guide: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedap">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedap</a> I assumed, maybe if I fixed my configuration files I would have dhcp running. So I checked my present config files and compared them<br />- I added the &#039;interface wifi&#039; section according to Step 1 with ip 192.168.1.1, then config &#039;wifi-iface&#039; section with device wlan0 (I checked on ifconfig for the proper interface name) and psk2 encryption added as described in Step 2<br />- I rebooted</p><p>Voilà, router boots again but no LAN dhcp, no wlan DHCP (but wlan is there), and it appears to drop all packets (cannot ping/ssh/telnet/....).</p><p>For unbricking, I tried:</p><p>- Turning router off/on, listening on UDP 4919 and waiting&nbsp; for the packet to press the reset button (with the exact tcpdump command used in <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe#triggering.via.hardware.button.standard.openwrt.method">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/gener … wrt.method</a> and ip set to 192.168.1.2, netmask to 255.255.255.0) -&gt; packet never arrives (but the broken no-dhcp no-pingable-router wlan comes up as always, so the system boots)<br />- Turning router off/on, simply pressing the reset button randomly to trigger failsafe<br />- Turning router off/on and instantly telnetting (netcat) to 192.168.1.1 port 23 to see if tftp was working. netcat simply terminates without doing anything, so apparently not working either<br />- Turning router off/on, pressing reset button 15+ seconds for built-in factory reset. After waiting for a while, nothing interesting happens, and manually turning off/on brings up the openwrt with its broken wlan as always<br />- Turning router off, pressing reset button down, turning router on, waiting for 15+ seconds for another shot at the built-in factory reset. Same, nothing happens.</p><p>Now what to do? I am not sure what JTAG even is, and soldering stuff to the board for serial connections is also a bit beyond my hardware knowledge. All I want is having the router in any state where I can simply connect and just DO ANYTHING again. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jonasthiem</strong> on 30 Jan 2013, 21:15)</p>

					<p>Having made my WDR3600 unreachable earlier this week, I too had to enter failsafe mode. I didn&#039;t see you mention the fast blinking - see <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300</a></p><p>I changed the network setting on my Mac to have the 192.168.1.2 statis IP &amp; the listed subnet. I powered the router up &amp; pressed the reset button on next to the left antenna on the rear. The 2nd light (the SYS light) began a fast blink. I connected by telnet - mount_root; mtd -r erase rootfs_data &amp;&amp; reboot</p><p>I was able to restore full functionality. I sort of remember waiting for the UDP packet, but it never showed up. Maybe I did something wrong.</p>									</div>

					<p>Someone on IRC now gave me a visual hint that helps when there is no UDP packet: exactly right after the sys LED lights up for the first time.

					<p>Alright, hoping someone can help me out with this...and that I haven&#039;t just bricked my unit <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p><p>It&#039;s the TL-WDR3600 v1.1.&nbsp; I got OpenWRT running on it just fine using &quot;openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wdr3600-v1-squashfs-factory.bin&quot;, but couldn&#039;t download luci-app-qos.&nbsp; No idea why.&nbsp; Kept failing with a kernel error.&nbsp; Figured I&#039;d flash the sysupgrade (&quot;openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wdr3600-v1-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin&quot;).&nbsp; That, apparently, was a bad idea.</p><p>More than 10 minutes goes by and it hasn&#039;t refreshed or rebooted, so I rebooted it myself.&nbsp; I doubt I interrupted the update, but maybe I shouldn&#039;t have used syupgrade at all?&nbsp; Anyway, it won&#039;t resolve to 192.168.1.1.</p><p>When I TFTP into it, I get the &quot;login as:&quot; prompt (yay! right?), but no combination of admin/root will let me in.&nbsp; I tried my old password and nothing.&nbsp; I can&#039;t touch it.</p><p>I followed the failsafe instructions (power on, wait for sys light to come on, hold down reset button and the sys light blinks rapidly).&nbsp; I set my ethernet adapter&#039;s IPv4 to 192.168.1.2/255.255.255.0/192.168.1.1 and launch &quot;recvudp.exe&quot;...and nothing happens.&nbsp; I mean, the terminal window pops up, but I never get the failsafe message from the router.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried leaving recvudp open and power cycling the router (and going back into failsafe mode) and still nothing.</p><p>Thoughts?&nbsp; Is it truly bricked?&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Well, in case anyone stumbles across this thread, I&#039;m going to post what finally ended up working.</p><p>I had SSH access, but when I go to 192.168.1.1, I get nothing (so no web UI).&nbsp; Not sure why, but whatever.&nbsp; Also, for some reason, I lost SSH access when I left it unplugged, so I had to go back in via telnet (using PuTTY) and follow the commands I posted above, including establishing a password.&nbsp; So now we&#039;re back to SSH access and the router is hooked up the cable modem so that it will have Internet access (so it can download the firmware).&nbsp; Via the console, I then did:</p><p>cd /tmp<br />wget <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09-rc1/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wdr3600-v1-squashfs-factory.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_a … actory.bin</a><br />mtd -r write /tmp/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wdr3600-v1-squashfs-factory.bin firmware</p><p>I left it up until it said it was rebooting, and then left it for a little longer.&nbsp; I then closed the console, opened it back up and went in again via SSH.&nbsp; The rest probably isn&#039;t necessary, but it&#039;s what I did, anyway:</p><p>opkg update<br />opkg install luci<br />/etc/init.d/uhttpd enable<br />/etc/init.d/uhttpd start<br />opkg install luci-app-qos</p><p>and for the bootstrap theme:</p><p>cd /tmp<br />wget <a href="http://nut-bolt.nl/files/luci-theme-bootstrap_1-1_all.ipk">http://nut-bolt.nl/files/luci-theme-boo … -1_all.ipk</a><br />opkg install luci-theme-bootstrap_1-1_all.ipk</p><p>It all seems pretty common sense NOW.&nbsp; Not sure why it happened in the first place (maybe I rebooted while it was still updating the firmware, though I find it unlikely), but that&#039;s how I fixed it.</p>									</div>
