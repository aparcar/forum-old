					<p>Dear all,</p><p>I need some advice: need a well-supported OpenWRT switch with IPv6 support, 5 to 8 ports (or more) Ethernet RJ-45 plugs with Giga connectectivity and vlan support. The reason is that I am working on porting my own devices to OpenWRT and need a solution while doing this work.</p><p>What would be the perfect device including a gigabyte switch? Need to do no soldering to add memory or upgrade flash. It also needs to be OpenWRT friendly with easy to connect serial TTL plugs (no or minimal soldering).</p><p>TL-WDR3600<br/><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr3600">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr3600</a></p><p>Kind regards,<br/>Gnutella</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gnutella</strong> on 20 Mar 2015, 10:35)</p>
