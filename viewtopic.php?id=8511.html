					<p>Hello all. I&#039;ve been using OpenWrt since about RC4 or so, so I&#039;d say I&#039;m as familiar with it as the next guy. I am new to VPNs, however. I have a Pocket PC Phone edition, and it has an option to login to a &quot;Work&quot; network via VPN (or a Home network in my case). For the VPN tunnel, my options are &quot;PPTP&quot; or &quot;L2TP&quot;. There is no &quot;OpenVPN&quot; option. Can anyone point me in the right direction to get me started to making a self-contained VPN endpoint.&nbsp; Preferably with DHCP to the clients with the same IP Range as for Wired/Wireless clients. I am using the RC6 release of OpenWRT. I am also using WebIF^2. I have installed pptpd and pptp packages and am wondering: is that all that I need. </p><p>A side note: When using Webif^2 to install the openvpn-webif and hswebif packages failed because files in /etc/init.d/ already existed, and the new packages wanted to overwrite them. I deleted the files and then installed them manually. Oh, yeah. Is there some reason that pptpd runs on startup even though it is turned off in webif^2?</p>									</div>

					<p>I have pptpd running on my Wl-500gx with OpenWrt Kamikaze 2.4 kernel. I think pptpd is enough, but you need the following kernel modules loaded to support MPPE encyption: ppp_mppe_mppc, sha1, arc4<br />You can set the IP range for clients in /etc/pptpd.conf<br />e.g.<br />remoteip 192.168.0.201-204</p><p>I tried DHCP, but it didn&#039;t work on the first attempt, so i switched to the other solution.</p><p>Edit:<br />Don&#039;t forget the iptables routing rules, so your clients have access to your local net or the internet.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MMCM</strong> on 7 Dec 2006, 12:36)</p>

					<p>A good starting point to configure a PPTP VPN server for OpenWrt is the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/PPTPDHowto">PPTPDHowto</a> in the wiki.</p><p>In webif^2 you have a GUI to configure PPTP client and server.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>forum2006</strong> on 7 Dec 2006, 16:10)</p>

					<p>Hmm, Howtos. I&#039;ve been there in the past, but not for PPTP stuff. Thanks. I didn&#039;t think to look there. Speaking of the Howtos, could someone put a link to the main howto page somewhere that everyone can find them?</p><p>As for everything and everyone else, thanks. I do like to study things out before diving into a project. Too many times, I don&#039;t know how to do something, and change a setting to see if it achieves the desired effect. It sometimes does, other times I need to breakout the backup disks (or knoppix! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> )</p><p>Yes, I know that the wiki is maintained by the community.

					<p>All right, I&#039;ve installed X-Wrt, PPTPD, all required Kernel modules, and setup a client account. I cannot connect. Perhaps X-Wrt&#039;s Webif^2 doesn&#039;t configure the firewall to allow WAN connections correctly? I can ping my router, but I can&#039;t connect via PPTP.</p><p>Any ideas? How can I check if the firewall port has been opened?</p>									</div>

					<p>Just an aside: I wanted to clarify: I can ping the router from my client over wan interface across the Internet.</p><p>MY problem here, is that I don&#039;t have any convenient way to travel back and fourth between the outside and inside of my network. I have no car, and all of the signals around me are protected (including mine!). I&#039;d have to walk about 20 minutes to find an open, freely available public hotspot, test the connection, and walk back. I have looked through the howto, but the environment there is setup different than X-Wrt. I&#039;m not entirely sure that I know what info from the howto to change to match X-Wrt&#039;s implementation. I realize that Openwrt and X-Wrt are a work in progress, so as much as I would like it to &quot;Just work&quot; when I try to set stuff up, I won&#039;t complain.</p><p>Thanks for any help,</p><p>--Aaron</p>									</div>
