					<p>Here&#039;s a quick version of the situation-<br />Big picture issue: I sometimes see that syslogd and klogd stop running, and would like to have them automatically restarted when this happens.</p><p>Problem: after installing a custom image with a custom version of /etc/init.d/boot, the router does not respond to pings and I can&#039;t ssh into it.</p><br /><p>And here&#039;s a longer version of what&#039;s going on-</p><p>To try and get better reliability from syslogd and klogd, I&#039;m trying to use busybox&#039;s runit utilities to monitor and restart these programs. I&#039;ve been able to get this to work by making manual edits to an already-installed stock version of the /etc/init.d/boot script. This involves commenting-out two lines from that file like this<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>#&nbsp; &nbsp; [ -x /sbin/syslogd ] &amp;&amp; syslogd -C${log_size:-16} ${log_ip:+-L -R $log_ip${log_port:+:$log_port}}<br />#&nbsp; &nbsp; [ -x /sbin/klogd ] &amp;&amp; klogd</p></blockquote></div><p>and then creating scripts so that runit can start them (eg. /service/syslogd/run and /service/klogd/run )</p><p>As a next step, I want to create a custom image that contains these changes so I don&#039;t need to manually implement them. To do this, I create the necessary files in the openwrt&#039;s working directory&#039;s files/ subdirectory, run &quot;make world&quot; and then install the image on my router. But after rebooting, the router doesn&#039;t respond to pings or any other requests. The light is on, but the networking doesn&#039;t seem to work.</p><p>What can I do to get my changes to /etc/init.d/boot implemented?<br />Or is there a better way to improve reliability of syslogd and klogd?</p><p>I&#039;m running 8.09.1, brcm-2.4 version on an asus 520gu. Please let me know if I should include more information about my setup.</p><p>thanks<br />Dan</p>									</div>
