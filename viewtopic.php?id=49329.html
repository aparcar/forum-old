					<p>Hi all,</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have been doing some experiments with my pandaboard. I initially build an image from attitude adjustment branch of Openwrt. I have enabled the Wifi capabilities , and build the image with Wpa_supplicant. After booting the board, i have changed the mode from AP to STA in /etc/config/wireless, I have also changed the network interface from lan to wan. Then in /etc/config/network, i have done the following changes:</p><p>1) changed the ifname of lan from eth0 to wlan0<br />2) created a interface wan with proto as &quot;dhcp&quot; alone</p><p>Then inside the /etc/config/dhcp, i have included the line&nbsp; &quot; option ignore 1&quot; for lan interface.</p><p>Then gave the command as &quot;wifi&quot; after which it started connecting to the required AP and was able to get its own IP address automatically.</p><p>but when i run wpa_supplicant file, It is able to get authenticated , but not able to get the IP address. I tried udhcpc wlan0 command , no use of it. may i know what i should do inorder for the connection to get established properly and also should get the IP address.</p><br /><p>Please let me know if you require any more details.</p><p>Thanks in advance<br />Sheriff</p>									</div>
