					<p>I have some observations and suggestions for improving how opkg handles starting and stopping of services.</p><ul><li><p>good - opkg default_postinst enables and starts init.d defined services for clean installs.</p></li><li><p>bad - opkg does not stop services when doing a package &quot;remove&quot;.&nbsp; This appears due to a bug in the default_prerm function which sources the package defined prerm function.&nbsp; The package defined prerm function must end with a &quot;exit 0&quot; and since that is sourced inside default_prerm when it encounters the &quot;exit 0&quot; the execution of code after that does not happen.&nbsp; The code after that happens to be the code that automatically stops all the init.d services that are installed by the package.</p></li><li><p>bad - opkg does not stop services before doing an upgrade.&nbsp; There is no default_preinst function and for consistency there should be one.&nbsp; IMHO services whose binaries are being updated should be stopped before the update and started after the update.</p></li><li><p>bad - opkg does not start services after doing an upgrade.&nbsp; I guess this is consistent with not stopping them pre-upgrade.</p></li></ul><p>Seems to me opkg should do all or nothing when it comes to enabling, starting, and stopping services installed by a package.&nbsp; Comments?</p>									</div>
