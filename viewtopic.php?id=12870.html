					<p>So I&#039;ve come up with the idea recently to use my highly hacked fonera as a temp in-car AP routing a connection off my cellphone through the wireless interface. In theory this should be a piece of cake. Fonera has an open serial port running at 3.3V. The phone has a native serial interface at 3.3V that offers either a standard ppp connection or NMEA gps coordinates when enabled in the phone.</p><p>Well, I decided to run with the idea this evening and did a slight hackjob to wire up the fonera&#039;s serial header to the computer end of the phone&#039;s serial cable. The wiring was as follows:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Fon |  RX &lt;-&gt; TX  | Phone
Fon |  TX &lt;-&gt; RX  | Phone
Fon | Gnd &lt;-&gt; Gnd | Phone</code></pre></div><p>The voltage line on the fonera side was left unconnected since I couldn&#039;t find a place to connect it on the phone side. The phone outputs 3.3V to the connected serial devices as well so it&#039;d be kinda stupid to have the two Vcc lines &#039;running into each other&#039;.</p><p>But yeah. Needless to say I couldn&#039;t get squat to work. With the phone connected I tried feeding standard AT commands to the phone with no luck. And with NMEA output enabled on the phone, I attempted to cat the serial port with absolutely no output. I&#039;m at a loss. Any ideas what I may have missed would be GREATLY appreciated. Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>I also wanna note that I followed a small page on the dd-wrt wiki where it noted to cross the DTR and DSR and the RTS and CTS lines respectively on the phone side. i DO get the occasional gibberish lines when running a cat on ttyS0 right at the moments I unplug and plug in the phone, but nothing usable.</p>									</div>

					<p>I guess the serial interfaces are running conflicting baud rates... have you checked ?</p>									</div>
