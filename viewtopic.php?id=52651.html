					<p>Hi all</p><p>There&#039;s a reference in the Wiki which discusses the NVRAM section of the Broadcom 63xx CFE:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/bootloader/cfe">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/bootloader/cfe</a></p><p>It mentions some of the details of the checksum but not actually how it&#039;s calculated. I wonder if somebody has already done this (seems likely).</p><p>Thanks in advance</p><p>J.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think bcm63xx may use the same checksum as bcm47xx.

					<p>Thanks Zajec.</p><p>I also looked in a similar place and found that the checksum is calculated over the full 1024 bytes of the NVRAM but first the checksum field itself is zeroed. And the checksum used is crc32_le.</p><p>When I calculated a crc32 checksum manually, just using PC software, I got a different output than the correct one (in an example CFE). So that suggests crc_le is a different checksum calculation.</p><p>If I had a PC tool which provided that checksum calculation, that would be ideal.</p><p>j.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jeq</strong> on 12 Sep 2014, 09:32)</p>

					<p>Actually, I was using HxD and the particular hash I used was &quot;CRC-32&quot;.</p><p>Can you confirm that this is the same as the linux hash: crc32_le ?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for that, Checksum-32 is also provided in the HxD tool. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I&#039;ve done further testing of checksums in router firmware and I can&#039;t get any of them to work when I calculate them using either CRC-32 or Checksum32. The checksums are unsigned INTs of 4 bytes.</p><p>One checksum is in the header which is 58 bytes long. And it relates to the remainder of the firmware file, which is several MBs long. The start and end points for the calculation would seem to be obvious, yet I can&#039;t get the same sum. Or even the same 4 bytes reversed.</p><p>Another checksum in the header is for the header itself (just 58 bytes) but this is a bit trickier - if you include the checksum bytes in the calculation, it will never be stable, always giving a new result. So, I guess that you put zeroes in the header checksum field to start with, then perform the sum on all 58 bytes.</p><p>Still got a different result though <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />Tried both CRC-32 and Checksum-32.</p><p>To give an example: on this page -&gt; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wnr3500l">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wnr3500l</a><br />there&#039;s a link to a DD-WRT image, see the Installation section.</p><p>This firmware has a 58 byte header, of which bytes 0x24-27 are the header checksum. The value in the header is 61170D11. How do you get that ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jeq</strong> on 19 Sep 2014, 08:16)</p>
