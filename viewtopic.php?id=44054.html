					<p>Update:</p><p>Ok, did some more research and I quite like the TP-LINK TL-ER5120 as it is simple and fast. Can I install OpenWRT on it, does anyone know?</p><p>/Update.</p><p>Hi,<br />I&#039;m a newbe, I have never used OpenWRT before, so please bare with me. I&#039;m trying to figure out what router I should buy, your suggestions are very welcome, maybe someone even has something they want to sell.</p><p>I&#039;d like a router that let&#039;s me install OpenWRT via the original firmware (or has it installed already), because it&#039;s really not my terrain, I do websites, barely any true programming. I like using the Terminal to do some things like rsync-ing my backup drives etc, but that&#039;s basically it.</p><p>The router has to be capable of bundling four ADSL2+ connections via MLPPP (on package-level, no load balancing, it all has to be available to one single device). I don&#039;t mind using external Modems and plugging them in through WAN and I only need one free LAN Port to connect to the WAN Port of another device, managing the rest of the network. I don&#039;t need nor mind WiFi either, I&#039;d never turn it on anyway.</p><p>In case someone asks: Yes, my ISP supports true MLPPP, where the multiple PPP connections are bundled into one logical link, that then can be used by one device, effectively increasing bandwidth.</p><p>Thank you for your hardware suggestions and maybe some pointers on OpenWRT I should know that aren&#039;t in the documentation.</p><p>Edit: Updated the title to explain it better</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>unknwntrr</strong> on 8 May 2013, 14:31)</p>
