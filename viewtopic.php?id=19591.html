					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a wireless router tew-632brp. I have used it with the original firmware, with the D-Link DIR-615 firmware, and with the openWRT firmwares(openwrt, x-wrt and Stephen Gutknecht&#039;s firmwares).</p><p>Every firmware had an issue:</p><p>1) the original firmware didn&#039;t have static dhcp leases, the wireless went down from time to time, the router blocked and sometimes restarted.<br />2) the d-link firmware was great, static dhcp, some qos, but port forwarding could be set for only 8 rules and also the router went down from time to time<br />3) the openwrt firmware images were good, with telnet and ssh support, possibility to add packages, but i wanted some features that i couldn&#039;t install: wireless at least g and qos.<br />3.a)the wireless worked only with the openwrt firmware images from openwrt.org and from Stephen Gutknecht. But there was no space or no dependent packages available for installing qos-scripts for the kernel of the firmware, particularly the package kmod-ipt-imq<br />3.b)the x-wrt firmware was great, with great web interface, but they had the madwifi driver, which didn&#039;t detect the wireless card. when trying to install the kmod-mac80211 and kmod-ath9k drivers, the dependent packages kmod-crypto* were not available for the firmware kernel (i have manually checked the packages from openwrt.org and x-wrt.org.</p><p>Maybe i didn&#039;t look well enough, but i couldn&#039;t find how to flash firmware from command line using the images of type squashfr, rootfs, elf, vmlinuz.bin, etc, available from the openwrt and x-wrt stable kamikaze 8.09. Also, i couldn&#039;t find how to make firmware images such as bin, webui or uni (from the squashfs, rootfs, elf)&nbsp; flashable via fail-safe web interface. Also, I couldn&#039;t find how to reinstall the original trendet firmware (it gave me 404 - page not found after introducing admin and password via web interface), nor how to cleanup nvram (I heard that some settings were stored in nvram, but nvram command is not available in kernel 2.6).</p><p>I don&#039;t understand why the x-wrt developers didn&#039;t make a firmware image of the type .bin, .webui, .uni with the mac80211 and ath9k, but instead only with madwifi, which doesn&#039;t work.</p><p>I would like to ask some questions to whom may have some answers:<br />1) how to revert to trendnet original firmware? (it installs the firmware, but the web interface does not work - 404 not found)<br />2) how to install openwrt with mac80211, ath9k and qos (maybe with webif, but satisfactory with luci) and resolve dependencies?<br />3) why sometimes after installing and removing a package, the free space that remains is not the same and how to cleanup the installation?</p><p>Thanks in advance to anyone who could answer</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have successfully compiled my first firmware image in the uni format. I used my laptop, a Dell Inspiron with Fedora 10, 4 gb ram and core2duo 1.83 ghz.</p><p>Here&#039;s what I did:<br />1) as root I did<br />yum install build-essential binutils flex bison autoconf gettext texinfo sharutils subversion ncurses-devel ncurses-term zlib1g-dev<br />note that some packages names differ in fedora vs ubuntu<br />2) as reguar user I did:<br />mkdir /what/.../ever/svn<br />cd /what/.../ever/svn<br />svn co svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk/<br />cd trunk/<br />3) ./scripts/feeds update -a<br />4) ./scripts/feeds install -a<br />5) i wanted to install luci administration, so i did:<br />./scripts/feeds update packages luci<br />./scripts/feeds install -a -p luci<br />(5) this step actually i didn&#039;t do, bt i guess that if tou want to compile some packages, you can:<br />cd ..<br />svn co svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/packages/<br />i don&#039;t know what is with updating to the latest sources<br />svn up<br />and with<br />make packages/symlinks<br />I would like to compile it with webif, but i didn&#039;t succeed<br />6) i ran<br />cd trunk/<br />make menuconfig<br />chose atheros ar71xx, ad choose to compile most of the wanted packages prebuilt in, not as modules<br />7) done make, but it gave me an error teling me that i hae to do make V=99, so i did:<br />make v=99 world<br />i think it actually built the openwrt from scratch, ecause it downloaded gcc and linux kernel (about 80 mb, and all the sources for the required packages<br />in the end, it built the firmware images, and among them i found what i needed - the uni file<br />I flashed it via the failsafe webui<br />8) it worked, my first firmware imagebuilt from scratch.</p><p>Note: i think it is pretty safe flashing the uni files.<br />I&#039;ll test the qos, and i&#039;lll give you some feedback.<br />I&#039;ll put the image smewhere so you can downoad it.<br /><strong>[n]maybe you guys can help improuve this tutorial inserting/correcting some steps, eventually with the option to install the webif or odher packages.[/n]</strong></p><p>also check out<br /><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=16599">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=16599</a><br />and<br /><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=9180">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=9180</a><br />and<br /><a href="https://svn.openwrt.org/wiki/GetSource">https://svn.openwrt.org/wiki/GetSource</a></p><p>and i&#039;ll put some other links later</p><p>I think that compiling firmware images in .uni format from svn developpement trunk and from scratch with make V=99 is the best solution.</p><p>I didn&#039;t get the n speed</p><p>regards</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fratzicu</strong> on 10 Apr 2009, 12:04)</p>

					<p>OK,At the end of this post you&#039;ll find the link for my google site dedicated to OpenWRT Kamikaze firmware compiling. That page contains also some compiled packages for the latest kernel. Some of them were missing from the x-wrt snapshot page.</p><p>The only errors now are:<br />1) ip_tables: (C) 2000-2006 Netfilter Core Team<br />nf_conntrack version 0.5.0 (512 buckets, 2048 max)<br />CONFIG_NF_CT_ACCT is deprecated and will be removed soon. Please use<br />nf_conntrack.acct=1 kernel paramater, acct=1 nf_conntrack module option or<br />sysctl net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_acct=1 to enable it.<br />2) can&#039;t load conntrack support for proto=24<br />can&#039;t load conntrack support for proto=24<br />can&#039;t load conntrack support for proto=24<br />can&#039;t load conntrack support for proto=24<br />3) UDP: bad checksum. From 116.7.7.110:55760 to 86.105.204.202:42005 ulen 43<br />eth1: link down<br />ar71xx: pll_reg 0xb8050018: 0x13000a44<br />eth1: link up (100Mbps/Full duplex)<br />4) mount -t cifs //fratzicu/storage /tmp/mnt -o rw,user=***,password=**********<br />mount: mounting \\192.168.**.***\storage on /tmp/mnt failed: No such device</p><p>Else, it works very good, but the QOS still isn&#039;t as goog as that of the D-Link DIR-601 rev C firmware. I guess it&#039;s because of the download and upload link speed settings which I don&#039;t quite know how to set.</p><p>Next, I&#039;ll try compiling with the webif2</p><p><a href="http://sites.google.com/site/fratzicu/">http://sites.google.com/site/fratzicu/</a></p><p>Regards</p><p>Also check</p><p><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=85556#p85556">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=85556#p85556</a></p><p>and </p><p><a href="http://forum.x-wrt.org/index.php/topic,1213.0.html">http://forum.x-wrt.org/index.php/topic,1213.0.html</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fratzicu</strong> on 11 Apr 2009, 10:34)</p>
