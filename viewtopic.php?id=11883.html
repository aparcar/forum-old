					<p>Using a broadcom modem and Kamikaze pre-7.07 I tried to reflash the board with a BIN image, but I got the following error:</p><p>&quot;Bad trx header. This is not the correct file&quot;</p><p>It sounds like pre-7.07 allows only TRX images reflashes. <br />I haven&#039;t installed yet 7.07. Is this fixed on the stable version?</p>									</div>

					<p>I was however able to reflash my AP.<br />I just had to understand if it was a 7.07 bug or a development choose. <br />This choose is difficultly understandable for me. Maybe this is a way to &quot;merge&quot; all broadcom devices into an only firmware and make clarity about the difference between BIN and TRX.<br />Mine is not a critic of course, I just would like to understand this choose. Kamikaze is getting step by step a very good distribution and I&#039;m pretty satisfied of it. Maybe the backward compatibility in broadcom with the old format could be a good help to the novice user.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ggp81</strong> on 31 Jul 2007, 18:35)</p>
