					<p>Hello. I have a weird problem here.</p><p>I have a WR1043nd running 10.03.1 rc4 set up with a ext3 formatted hard drive, shared with samba3.</p><p>My smb.conf contains &quot;unix charset = ISO-8859-1&quot;</p><p>Whenever I copy a file with accented characters to a folder inside a share on the router, depending on the folder and depending on the file, I hear the hard drive starting to seek like crazy (I assume it&#039;s trying to swap to the swap partition) and then, after a few moments, I get a &quot;failed to transfer file &quot; message from my OS, I have lots of &quot;I ran out of memory&quot; messages in dmesg and eventually, the router reboots.</p><p>To make things stranger, not all files with accents or target folder exhibit these symptoms, but if I find such a file/folder combination, I can reproduce the problem on every time. Also, if I rename the file to use unaccented characters, I can move it to the share and then rename it on the share with the original accented character.</p><p>Any ideas?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stanelie</strong> on 24 Jan 2011, 02:42)</p>
