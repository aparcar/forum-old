					<p>I have the Asus WL-500g Deluxe router, and there is a pin header J1 on the board which brings out three GPIO lines, 1, 3, and 5. Using the gpio utility I found here, I can easily turn these on and off using &#039;gpio 7 enable&#039;, for example, and I verfied with a meter that the voltage on these lines is 0 when disabled and ~3.21 when enabled.</p><p>Question is, what current is available on these lines? If I want to use one to turn off and on a solid state relay to press a shutter on a film camera, for example, can I directly drive the relay from the pin, or do I need a relay driver chip? I can&#039;t find a data sheet on the broadcom 5365 to tell me what&#039;s available.</p>									</div>

					<p>I would suggest buffering the output just to be safe.&nbsp; You could probably just use a CMOS-type 7400 IC.&nbsp; I would also check the requirements of your solid state relay against the buffer IC&#039;s specs.&nbsp; Your router would be more expensive to replace than a buffer IC (:</p>									</div>
