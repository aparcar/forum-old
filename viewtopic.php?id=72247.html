					<p>I used standard menu to upload OWRT firmware. It worked well and I almost finished dealing with understanding its promising menus. But occasionally turned WiFi off. That was a real mistake - to turn it off and completely loose the operability (as wifi was the only possible connection&nbsp; method). So I had to find a soldering iron and buy USB to RS232 port. I connected 2 wires to the yellow points fron your pic (RX/TX) and also a black GND.</p><p>Could you be so kind to make some moments a bit clearer:<br />1. You told you &quot;connected 2 wires to this&quot; (USB-to-RS232-TTL-Serial-port), but in the picture there was GND shown (black colour) as well. Did you also connect it to the port?<br />2.What voltage should I set (using the bridge connection) 3 or 5 volts?<br />3. Do I have to power on the Sata chips (main plate) also? Of course &quot;Yes&quot; - or otherwise Linux wont&#039;t be loaded. But do I have to attach a SATA HDD?<br />5. Does OWRT Linux load by default when powerd on or should I long-press the rear button to initiate startup?<br />6. What Putty settings should be changed from defaults (except com port number)?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi! An idea:<br />Is it possible to include to the next firmware version&nbsp; (if any is supposed to be done) a working Reset button, which would restore owrt firmwate do defaults. Of course it is still possible to use USB2RS232 to connect directly to linux and do something like this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# rm -rf /overlay/*
root@OpenWrt:~# sync 
root@OpenWrt:~# reboot</code></pre></div><p>But welding and case disassambling and wire connection takes time and requires carefullness (to avoid any short circuit). </p><p>Probably it is possible to make the Reset button a trigger for the above commands?<br />Why could this be useful? This is a very quick reset method in case of wrong network setup. <br />In my practice I have lost connection to the device several times due to my errors in network configuration (wifi was no longer available; the PC could not acquire IP address from the router; other troubles)</p>									</div>

					<p>We have different abilities: I never succeeded in any compiling :-( just do not know how to (and I am neither a programmer nor a Linux developer) So each time I have to look for another way to overcome obstacles. Here is what I have done:</p><p>I downloaded a firmware that was for a bit different model of Kimax (the link from my previous post). it is only 3Mb, 3 times less than the one you shared with us. But this one looked more fresh. Than updated to it using web interface from your firmware. Fortunately it successfully started, without a WiFi. I connected to com port using your method and started WiFi. I used WinSCP to copy all my config files from the previous working system (from one of backup files that I preserved (done with web GUI)). This step was necessary to avoid manual configuration steps. After reboot I had network configured (up and running) and could just download and install LEDE web interface.</p><p>From this point everything goes well right from GUI (no conflicts or dependencies trouble. All packets are installable,. Including samba and cidepages like utf8/koi)</p>									</div>

Maybe kernel subversion is changed each time you do compilation. But packets want the original one. Perhaps there is a compilation option to give the kernel just the same name as the original one has.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi!<br />I have a strange device behaviour after reflash to fix bugs:<br />1. It has both features - HDD available to PC and OWRT running at the same time (previously when pressing a side button. linux started to initiate an access point and this instantly made HDD unavailable to windows)<br />2. It is absolutely impossible to mount HDD in linux as /dev/sda* is totally missing (why?)</p><p>I tried to do all imaginable things these days:<br />- flashed to new/old firmware from this forum thread (rev2.lede-ramips-mt7620-u25awf-h1-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin; lede-ramips-mt7620-u25cwf-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin) as well as from here <a href="http://downloads.lede-project.org/snapshots/targets/ramips/mt7620/">http://downloads.lede-project.org/snaps … ps/mt7620/</a><br />- I did &quot;firstboot&quot; and &quot;rm -rf /overlay/*&quot; ...&nbsp; etc</p><p>Any idea ?</p><p>P.S. I even tried to reformat HDD as ext4/fat/ntfs in a primary and logical partitions as well as switched to MBR and GPT. It is always available in windows (ext4 via extra driver)&nbsp; but no more&nbsp; in OWRT :-(</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vadim245</strong> on 19 Dec 2017, 18:50)</p>
