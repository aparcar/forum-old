					<p>I have Dropbear configured to accept key-only authentication attempts from the WAN side. On 12.09 and 14.07, that worked fine.</p><p>However, every device I upgraded to 15.05 so far gets unreachable remotely. The keys and config are the same.<br />This is how it looks when I try to connect:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>$ ssh -v -p 12345 root@kalliope.blabla.com
OpenSSH_6.7p1 Debian-5, OpenSSL 1.0.1k 8 Jan 2015
debug1: Reading configuration data /home/user/.ssh/config
debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config
debug1: /etc/ssh/ssh_config line 19: Applying options for *
debug1: Connecting to kalliope.blabla.com [214.19.13.10] port 12345.
debug1: connect to address 214.19.13.10 port 12345: Connection refused
ssh: connect to host kalliope.blabla.com port 12345: Connection refused</code></pre></div><p>This looks like Dropbear isn&#039;t listening on the WAN port? The port is open in the firewall.</p><p>When I connect locally, I can log in (default port 22), so Dropbear is indeed listening on that port. If I restart Dropbear, I can log in remotely fine as well. Dropbear gets priority 50 at boot, which to me seems late enough in the boot sequence.</p><p>Logread doesn&#039;t show anything that looks useful (PID 1000: before the restart, PID 3120: after).</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># logread |grep dropbear
Mon Jun 22 20:58:14 2015 authpriv.info dropbear[1000]: Early exit: Terminated by signal
Mon Jun 22 20:58:15 2015 authpriv.warn dropbear[3120]: Failed listening on &#039;22&#039;: Error listening: Address family not supported by protocol
Mon Jun 22 20:58:15 2015 authpriv.info dropbear[3120]: Not backgrounding</code></pre></div><p>For now I&#039;ve remedied it by restarting Dropbear through rc.local after startup, but I&#039;d like to fix it. Any pointers are welcome.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Borromini</strong> on 28 Jun 2015, 00:02)</p>

					<p>OK so this is getting pretty weird. Now dropbear starts failing seemingly randomly, connecting from a client in the LAN still works, if I restart dropbear WAN-side authentication works again.</p><p>Is there a way to get dropbear to be more verbose?</p>									</div>
