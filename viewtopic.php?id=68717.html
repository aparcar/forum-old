					<p>I have a Mac mini at home running Mac OS Sierra 10.12.1 and Server 5.2 configured with an L2TP VPN server.&nbsp; I can connect to it using my iPhone 6 running iOS 10.1.1 by configuring a L2TP VPN with the server, account, password and secret for my Mac mini, giving me access to other devices on my home LAN and, because the Mac is configured for Internet Connection Sharing, my iPhone can get out onto the Internet with my home broadband IP address.&nbsp; Essentially it gives me my very own <a href="http://strongvpn.com/amer-anywhere.html">http://strongvpn.com/amer-anywhere.html</a> type service.&nbsp; So far so good.</p><p>I also have a TP-Link WR703N running OpenWRT Chaos Calmer 15.05.01 which I&#039;ve set up as a wifi-to-ethernet bridge: the wifi side is connected to a wifi network that gives access to the Internet and the ethernet port is connected to my laptop.&nbsp; This allows my laptop to get internet access through its ethernet port.&nbsp; Also hunky-dorey.</p><p>The thing I want to do is get the WR703N to connect to the L2TP VPN on my Mac mini so that my laptop can route through the Mac to devices on my home LAN, and use ICS to get out onto the Internet using my home broadband IP address.</p><p>I did some searching and found <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/connect_by_l2tp">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/connect_by_l2tp</a> which appears to be exactly what I want, but after running </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>opkg update</code></pre></div><p> and then </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>opkg install openl2tp-full</code></pre></div><p> I get the error </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Unknown package &#039;openl2tp-full&#039;.</code></pre></div><p>.&nbsp; Running </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>opkg find *l2tp*</code></pre></div><p> doesn&#039;t show any near misses, so now I&#039;m a bit stuck, as all my searches for </p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>openwrt l2tp vpn client</p></blockquote></div><p> find articles about setting up openwrt was a VPN server.</p><p>Can someone please point me in the right direction?&nbsp; Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kbro</strong> on 28 Nov 2016, 00:50)</p>

					<p>Thanks for that.&nbsp; I was wondering whether I&#039;d found some outdated info.&nbsp; The output to <strong>opkg find *l2tp*</strong> that I ran yesterday gave me this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>kmod-l2tp - 3.18.23-1 - Kernel modules for L2TP V3 Support

					<p>I&#039;m on lede. But it does not matter. xl2tpd has been in use for many years in openwrt. Even Attitude Adjustment has it and it works fine.<br />I dont think you&#039;re mere mortal cause you can ssh <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> Configuring l2tp client in luci is very easy.

					<p>See logread output. l2tp and pppd log messages to syslog.<br />Also note that if you think you need l2tp within your home network then you do something wrong.<br />I can hardly imagine why l2tpd would ever be needed in a single private network.<br />If you use l2tp over internet then without additional ipsec layer communication is unencrypted.<br />If your l2tp sever is set up to require encryption (on mac it should be easy and probably its on by default) then openwrt cant connect without additional manual configuration of strongswan. And this is not as easy as plaintext.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bolvan</strong> on 28 Nov 2016, 13:40)</p>

					<p>Uci does not means luci. Uci allows <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/ipsec">uniformed config</a> in /etc/config. Luci allows editing it in web forms.<br />IPSEC is not necessary have to be used with l2tp. It runs on its own in tunnel or transport mode and knows nothing about l2tp.<br />When l2tp is used with ipsec the main layer is ipsec in transport mode.<br />Ipsec encrypts udp packets to vpn server. Usually port 1701.<br />L2tp works normally over encrypted udp. For l2tpd its transparent. l2tp provides tunneling. l2tp knows nothing about ipsec.<br />So there&#039;re 2 independend configs. One ipsec, one l2tpd. You can still use luci to configure l2tp but there&#039;s no luci module for strongswan. Still you can use uci configs for strongswan</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bolvan</strong> on 28 Nov 2016, 14:24)</p>

					<p>Okay, got that.&nbsp; So I need to install and configure StrongSWAN to give me an IPsec layer for L2TP to run on top.&nbsp; I&#039;m struggling to find a HOWTO telling me what to do - I keep finding stuff about using StrongSWAN on a server, not a client.&nbsp; I did try <strong>opkg install strongswan</strong> but all I succeeded in doing was exhausting my install space!&nbsp; I had to do a Reset clean everything out, then reinstall the xl2tpd stuff (which leaves me with 184KB, if that&#039;s any help).&nbsp; Any suggesting on where I should look next?&nbsp; Many thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you want your openwrt act as more or less normal linux system then you need extroot.<br />Thats why its highly recommended to buy routers with USB or at least 16 mb of flash.<br />Its possible to incorporate packages into compressed squashfs during own compilation or change existing image with imagebuilder. But I guess 184kb will not be enough even for compressed package. Leave at least 100 kb on overlayfs or you may find your router to be autoreset to default settings.</p>									</div>
