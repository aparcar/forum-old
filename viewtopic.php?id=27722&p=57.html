					<p>I reported the same issue with OpenWRT/arokh&#039;s builds. I have a Zenithink ePad and I get the same messages as you see (hostapd: wlan0: STA 00:21:2f:2b:43:09 IEEE 802.11: deauthenticated due to local deauth request). It drove me nuts and I decided to try it with dd-wrt and the original Netgear stock firmware (1.0.14.98) ...but..with both firmwares I do not have a single problem to WiFi connect my ePad, it&#039;s only with OpenWRT that it fails.. :-( </p><p>I know that there was a time I had no problems with OpenWRT but in one a the new builds the problem started..but unfortunately, I don&#039;t know as of which version that was...</p><p>So for the time being, I&#039;m now using the original Netgear stock firmware. Will give OpenWRT a try again by the end this month to see if it has been resolved, if not, maybe an opportunity to see how dd-wrt is behaving by then..</p>									</div>
