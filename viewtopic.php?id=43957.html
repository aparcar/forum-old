					<p>Dear *,</p><p>I&#039;m running Barrier Braker (r36485) and LuCI (svn-r9812) on an WDR4900 and works perfectly so far. Now, as I understand, the uci firewall is just a &quot;nicer&quot; front end that generates &quot;code&quot; for iptables, which in turn configures some netfilter modules that actually perform the filtering. To that end, the UCI firewall only supports a predefined statements like &quot;rule&quot;s and stuff.</p><p>My LuCI interface looks like this: <a href="http://tinypic.com/r/33e5r1i/5">http://tinypic.com/r/33e5r1i/5</a></p><p>Where on earth is the &quot;add rule&quot; button for such custom rules in LuCI? My custom rules show up in the interface under network -&gt; firewall and I can edit, save and delete them. But the only way to _add_ them is through vi&#039;ing /etc/config/firewall. Am I missing something?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Use one of the both &quot;Open port on router&quot; or &quot;New forward rule&quot; buttons, they&#039;re basically shortcuts to create a new rule with a few predefined values - you can still fully edit them afterwards</p>									</div>
