					<p>I am looking for an appropriate wlan router, which should have the following abilities:<br />1.)<br />I am sharing a fast Internet connection with my neighbor over wlan, whereas my Computer is the client.<br />Now I want to add this new router, configured as wlan-client, to be able to connect more computers/devices<br />to the Internet on my side. So, the router must be configurable as wlan client. As I have read so far, OpenWRT does<br />support this configuration.<br />2.)<br />I also would like to do voip over the network. So far I only have a analog telephone<br />(well, exactly is it a analog DECT station with 4 phones).<br />So it would be good if the router also had at least 1 analog telephone connector.<br />I also read that it is possible to install asterist on OpenWRT. But as I understand it,<br />this is only the software part - the router still would need analog telephone connector</p><p>3.)<br />I also would find it quite useful if the device had a USB (2) connector.</p><p>I really appreciate if some one can give me some advice.<br />Thanks.</p>									</div>
