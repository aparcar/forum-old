					<p>Hi.&nbsp; First of all, to introduce myself as a noob would be to overstate my lack of qualifications to a degree hitherto unknown by mankind.&nbsp; However, I did spend a few days reading many threads on this forum before I decided to post.&nbsp; I just wanted to say that I have the same hardware as dlang and have tried the same steps he has taken with the same results.&nbsp; Am I right in thinking that there simply is no build for the FR-300RTR nor for its D-Link clone at this time?</p>									</div>

					<p>more likely it means that there is a slight tweak we need to do to make the build install though the normal interface, and we just haven&#039;t had someone who knows what they are doing get their hands on one&nbsp; of these yet.</p>									</div>

					<p>I tried flashing via tftp just in case that would make a difference.&nbsp; Seems like it did not.&nbsp; tftp reported a successful transfer, but all that seems to have happened is a reset to the factory firmware (along with default IP, finding which was a fun puzzle for a few minutes).&nbsp; By the way, I did follow the instructions on the wiki to the letter, including the 30-30-30 reset before and after the (attempted) flash.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if this information might help shed any light on the issue, but I thought it wouldn&#039;t hurt to share what I tried with the community.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>brock</strong> on 9 Feb 2010, 05:12)</p>

					<p>Isnt there a easier way i thought i could flash it via the normal interface..Cant the binary be modified so it will take it via the standard&#039;s frys.com web interface or is that not possible.<br />I thought i read somewhere about people doing that to get other router&#039;s to take the binaries.<br />I tried openwrt_r15686_ar71xx-dir-615c1-squashfs.uni this is the right image ?.<br />i am using the latest REV E version of the frys.com dir-615.<br />Thanks<br />I willing to pay someone to figure out how to get this to work easily if someone is available.</p>									</div>
