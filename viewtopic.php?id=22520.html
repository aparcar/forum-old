					<p>I have a D-Link Airplus G DI-524&nbsp; r.E1 Wireless Router that I would like to flash to openWRT for use as a range-extender/client bridge/repeater bridge</p><p>It appears to have enough room for the micro version.&nbsp; <br />I am new to this, and I do not know where to look for the files that would work for this application.&nbsp; <br />I would like to know more about the tftp process for openwrt, as I have limited experience with this on my Linksys wrt54g-tm.&nbsp; <br />The web interface is more familiar to me, but I do not believe that an image exists at this time, and I am not familiar with the process for building a custom image.&nbsp; </p><p>I am also restricted in possible methods, as I do not have JTAG or CFE equipment.&nbsp; I have been researching this for the last week, and I would like to know if a generic micro version, once flashed, would work for this application.&nbsp; </p><p>This is a second router, gathering dust, and fairly kludgy on the functionality of the current firmware.&nbsp; I would not consider this a great loss if it got bricked, as I got it second-hand for a bargain at a local thrift store.&nbsp; I believe the information would be helpful and would add to the supported hardware.&nbsp; I think that the d-link source is also available, but it is huge, guessing from a file size of 80+ mb.&nbsp; This is well beyond my extremely limited experience with programing.</p><p>M/N:&nbsp; DI-524<br />H/W:&nbsp; E1<br />FCCID: KA2DI524E1</p><p>Chipset:&nbsp; Atheros&nbsp; AR2315A<br />Flash:&nbsp; Spansion FL016AIF (2MB?)<br />Ram:&nbsp; NANYA NT5SV8M16DS-6K (16MB?)</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>									</div>

					<p>I would assume that the <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09.1/atheros/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09.1/atheros/</a> directory would have the appropriate files.&nbsp; Is the &quot;openwrt-atheros-root.squashfs&quot; (1,664 KB) a full binary, or does this require another file(s) as well?&nbsp; I have seen reference to bootloaders, such as a &quot;redboot&quot;.&nbsp; I am runing windows pc os, so I would have to utilize the windows apps (command prompt, 3rd party) to flash.&nbsp; I hope someone has a moment to spare.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>									</div>
