					<p>I hear you, I&#039;ve got a few posts going LOL.</p><p>It&#039;s all working pretty good, just some things which I am having a hard time either finding information on or absorbing because of information overload. However, each time I succeed at one thing, it&#039;s yet another thing I have filed away. </p><p>I&#039;m enjoying this, it&#039;s been cool to see this little device come to life. The dual dhcp thing was baffling but now I know why. I have a solar monitoring system which grabs an IP from the dhcp server but it never lets it go. When I released the dhcp server ips yesterday, the solar device never let go of it&#039;s ip but the router didn&#039;t know about it so guess what, a conflict. </p><p>Now that that is fixed, life is simpler because that was quite confusing. Now on to all of the other things I&#039;m hoping to resolve, which at least aren&#039;t as confusing <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p><p>Thanks to everyone for the help the ssh problem, weird but solved finally.</p>									</div>

					<p>So it turns out that the manufacturer, solarbridge, could care less to fix their software. Not only does the device have a default IP but it picks up a dhcp ip which it never releases. And that, is the problem.</p><p>Thanks for all the help!</p>									</div>
