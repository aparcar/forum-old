					<p>Hi guys, need some answer about wrt3200.<br />I come from an old WRT320N flashed with Tomato...running since 2009 now dropping dead...but Tomato does not support Marvell 88E6352&nbsp; and so i can&#039;t flash my brand new wrt3200 with it.<br />The questions are:<br />- Chaos Calmer does not support wrt3200, right? <br />- Lede is the only stable firmware?<br />- Can i flash &quot;as it is&quot;, without making any partition?<br />- Can i easily rollback to Linksys firmware or &quot;migrate&quot; to DD-WRT?<br />- What about wifi? Is it true that it has major issues (i.e. loss of signal, difficult on 5ghz, and tons of other stuff)?</p><p>Thanx in advance.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pulque</strong> on 20 Nov 2017, 22:04)</p>

Start fresh with a clean slate.<br />4 &quot;- Can i easily rollback to Linksys firmware or &quot;migrate&quot; to DD-WRT?&quot; Yes&nbsp; -- Just follow the rollback procedure.<br />5 &quot;- What about wifi? Is it true that it has major issues (i.e. loss of signal, difficult on 5ghz, and tons of other stuff)?&quot;&nbsp; Since the firmware and wifi Driver are based on Linsys Closed Source drivers/firmware... I would expect very similar performance and availability until just recently. Not to say it hasn&#039;t had it&#039;s problems, because before June, wifi really wasn&#039;t usable at all. Here recently with the Wifi Krack patches, there&#039;s been an issue with clients trying to re-join which causes the router to reboot.. This condition may take an hour or could take 4 days or longer, but is actively being worked on. There have been a lot of issues with Enterprise level situations where people are trying to run Radius or some other Enterprise type of authentication systems and are having issues. Anyhow, there are 6 current issues, and you can read about them --&gt; <a href="http://%20https://github.com/kaloz/mwlwifi/issues"> https://github.com/kaloz/mwlwifi/issues</a>&nbsp; The host command timeout is the major issue being worked.</p>									</div>

					<p>make sure you pick the factory not sysupgrade version to flash if it still has factory linksys firmware.</p><p>There are two firmware partitions in the 3200acm, when you flash it will flash to the other partition and automatically boot to it.&nbsp; So if you get linksys when you reboot it did recovery and now you have one bad flash partition.&nbsp; come for help before you flash again if that happens to avoid bricking.</p>									</div>
