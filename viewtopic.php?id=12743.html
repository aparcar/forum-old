					<p>my understanding is that ifname relates to the broadcom driver and has to be &#039;wl0&#039;;<br />&#039;wifi&#039; is the name given in user space for routing and interface definition purposes; it can be anything unique you like, probably within some length bounds.</p><p>In the wireless section &#039;network&#039; is not to be taken literal as in &#039;a wireless network&#039; but is just a reference to the definition file which was baptized &#039;network&#039; and in which in my example &#039;wifi&#039; got defined.<br />That interface can have multiple coexisting virtual implementations, called devices within the iface section (confusing), which get enumerated like wifi0, wifi1.<br />If you like you can also in the &#039;network&#039; file assign different subnets to different wireless virtual interfaces.<br />As long as it is on the same physical medium (channel), one radio can emulate an access point and a client, or two or more access points with different ssids at the same time !<br />In the &#039;wireless&#039; wifi-device section those medium characteristics get defined that all virtual interfaces must have in common (obviously the simple radio cannot channel hop and there is only one radio hardware). In the wifi-iface section(s) the characteristics of the individual virtual interfaces get defined, like their role and authentication and key management.&nbsp; </p><p>Personally I find it all rather confusing terminolgy (interface, iface, device, network, ifname); also not sure that I understood it all correctly, hence the &#039;my understanding is&#039; in the first sentence, so take it with a grain of salt.<br />I did manage to make a wrt54g emulate two APs with different ssids at the same time.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>doddel</strong> on 17 Oct 2007, 01:23)</p>

You cannot rely on the scripts that the config sections are processed sequentially if you think that you could try to number the interfaces sequentially (e.g. ath0 first). The scripts run in the background and you will never know the order. And there is still the option that some application creates its own wireless interface for its purposes (like the monitoring interface) and your hardcoded config will not work.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi</p><p>yeah I understood, my problem was when I remove the ifname, I can not use ifup wireless it doesn&#039;t bring up the device.</p><p>I tried </p><p>reboot - wireless is up and configured<br />ifdown wireless - interface up <br />ifup wireless - nothing interface did not come back ! (using ifconfig)<br />wifi up - brings interface up</p><br /><p>If I set the ifname then I can use ifup/ifdown, i have made a mental not to check the athx matching if I have a problem with wireless or I setup multiple wifi</p>									</div>
