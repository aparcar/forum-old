					<p>So I recently installed a new build and noticed that the system seems to be working with my ISPs IPv6 now.&nbsp; The only problem is that I&#039;m not sure things are working correctly (I am seeing some inconsistencies and I&#039;m not sure whether that&#039;s because there&#039;s a problem or if it might be a bug in trunk).</p><p>Anyway, here are the things that seem odd to me:</p><p>1.&nbsp; When I view the &quot;Overview&quot; page in Luci I see no IPv6 address under the IPv6 WAN Status section.&nbsp; It just looks like this where the address is displayed:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Address: ::</code></pre></div><p>2.&nbsp; I do see a global IPv6 address on the br-lan interface and my clients are passing the tests at <a href="http://test-ipv6.com/">http://test-ipv6.com/</a> so something is obviously working.</p><p>3.&nbsp; I can see that the clients have IPv6 global addresses when I view their network properties but I don&#039;t see any of the clients in my &quot;Active DHCPv6 Leases&quot; under the &quot;DHCP and DNS&quot; section in Luci (with the exception of my Windows 2012 R2 server, it shows under the leases section and the lease is the correct global address).</p><p>4.&nbsp; When I run the IPv6 DDNS update script it tells me it can&#039;t find the IPv6 address.&nbsp; I changed the config to point to br-lan interface and it ran correctly but I&#039;m not sure that is the correct IP.&nbsp; Shouldn&#039;t the WAN6 interface get an IP too?</p><p>Every now and then my client seem to lose IPv6 connectivity so I&#039;m trying to troubleshoot everything as best I can.&nbsp; Any help would be great as I&#039;m still learning IPv6.</p><p>Here is a dump (with some data redacted) of my ifstatus wan6:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>{

This distinction is important, as many DHCPV6 clients assume that once you use stateful DHCPv6, you will get a global scope address from a NA request. This is a wrong assumption and will not work with Telus. The client must only request a PD, and then use this prefix to configure its interfaces, both LAN and WAN. It appears that your client does it correctly for the LAN side, most of them do. What it does is it takes the prefix assigned from Telus, (in your case it is 2001:569:741e:9900/56), completes it with a subnet number (in your case 01, probably because you specified prefix-id :1 in your configuration) which creates prefix 2001:569:741e:9901/64, and then generates two global scope IPv6 addresses on switch0. One is 2001:569:741e:9901::1, (because you hard-coded host-address to ::1), another one is EUI-64-generated 2001:569:741e:9901:46d9:e7ff:fe07:73be/64 (because you requested autoconf on switch0). So yes, you do have now two global scope IPv6 addresses on the LAN interface. One would be enough.</p> <br /><br /><p>So far so good. What is missing is the address on the WAN interface (eth1). If your router is expecting an address on eth1 from Telus through SLAAC (is that the meaning of autoconf on eth1?) then it will never get configured. If it uses DHCPv6 NA requests, it will never get configured either. What it should do instead is exactly the same what it did on switch0: create a subnet (use FF), and an arbitrary host ID, (based on EUI-64 like Actiontec, or simply ::1 will be probably OK too), and use this to assign an IPv6 address to eth1</p></blockquote></div><p><a href="http://forum.telus.com/t5/Internet-TV-Home-Phone/IPv6-connectivity/td-p/3521/page/2">http://forum.telus.com/t5/Internet-TV-H … 521/page/2</a></p><p>So, is there a way to force the router to pass itself an IP from the PD?</p>									</div>

					<p>IPv6 works differently than IPv4. It is prefectly reasonable for your WAN to only have a link-local address. As you said it was working. See this about an ISP in Canada which uses link-local for the WAN<br /><a href="http://www.makikiweb.com/ipv6/blog04_connecting_to_teksavvy.html">http://www.makikiweb.com/ipv6/blog04_co … savvy.html</a></p><p>By passing up the option ipassign 60, your have just traded a /56 for a /60. I would call that a down grade, IMHO. The router will only use a /64 for the LAN. But if you have down stream routers, or you partition some of your LAN ports to other networks, the /60 (or /56) extra prefixes will be assigned to them.</p><p>I have a /48 (from Hurricane Electric) which is being sub-Prefix-Delegated to down stream routers. Works great!</p>									</div>
