					<p>Hello,</p><p>i want to buy a new router that is fully openwrt compatible. Actually i have a Speedport W501V with freetz-firmware (speed2freetz) (Its a Fritzbox from AVM) that integrates a dsl-modem, an accesspoint and two analog voip-ports. </p><p>Did openwtrt supports hardware with voip-ports and an integrated dsl-modem? </p><p>After reading here in the forum, i found a recomendation for the TP-Link TL-WR1043ND (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd?s#version.1.4.main.board">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl- … main.board</a>).<br />But with this device, i would have three separete devices (1 dsl-modem, 1voip-box, 1 ap).</p><p>Thanks for your help</p>									</div>

					<p>The WRT54GS is the best router of Openwrt. You can use versions 1.0 to 3.0. It has some nice features.<br />- 8MB flash memory<br />- built-in 4-port switch<br />- 200MHz MIPS processor<br />- WAN/internet port <br />- 32MB RAM<br />- 802.11b/g wireless access point</p>									</div>

These days, most of 2nd generation VoIP devices are based on a TI AR7 platform with a VoIP (Le88221) chip/driver licensed by Legerity, AFAIK. However, I beloeve Legerity has GPLed its driver source code, but I don&#039;t know why OpenWRT has not caught up its developments with this GPLed source, yet.</p>									</div>

I have OpenWRT on a WRT54GL already, and the extra features I listed aren&#039;t too important so I may just go with the WRT54GS 3.0.)</p>									</div>
