					<p>Well, I did the same. And, unfortunately, I am in the middle of ruining it totally. :-) </p><p>But you still have a few options. They are general solutions, so you should try to find it in the forum.</p><p>There is the 30-30-30 method.<br />There is the tftp method which you can use right after starting up your router.<br />There are other merthods that involve some hardware modification (soldering a serial connector to the breadboard of the router) and do some magic over serial line. This last thing created some problems for me because I slightly moved one of the smd resistors on the board so watch out!</p><p>If you happen to get to the latest point could you take some pictures of the board and post them here?</p>									</div>
