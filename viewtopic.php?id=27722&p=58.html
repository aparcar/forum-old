					<p>I&#039;m running this build (r27175), and I&#039;ve got most stuff working. However, there is one thing that annoys me:</p><p>When doing a port scan from GRCs ShieldsUp, ports show up as &quot;Closed&quot; and not &quot;Stealth&quot; as they did on the stock firmware. I found some old references to this &quot;problem&quot;, but I am unable to fix it. I&#039;d like to be &quot;Stealth&quot; for all ports that I don&#039;t explicitly forward to some machine in my lan, but I can&#039;t seem to figure out how. My firewall settings are unchanged from the defaults, except that I added some redirections (in Luci) for specific ports to specific machines.</p><p>Is there some rule i can add to /etc/firewall.user to become &quot;Stealth&quot; again?</p>									</div>

					<p>Never mind, I figured it out. I changed the Input to DROP instead of REJECT for the &quot;wan&quot; firewall zone, and this did the trick.

					<p>Please don&#039;t believe in this stealth nonesense. If anything, &quot;stealth&quot; tells an attacker that there *is* a firewall dropping packets - it&#039;s like holding up a sign stating &quot;nothing to see here&quot;. Also dropping ICMP echo replies gains you zero security, if at all it just disrupts services. E.g. HE.net does not let you establich an IPv6 tunnel if you do not allow pings.</p>									</div>

					<p>Indeed. Dropping packets would make you &quot;stealth&quot; in the case where an attacker would do a dumb scan for specific ports, but you are definitely not invisible. It&#039;s a false sense of security. Set up SSH on a non standard port and use good passwords is pretty much the only security a home user needs.

					<p>I do know there is no actual added security gained by being &quot;stealth&quot;, but dumb port scans could possibly fail if packets are just dropped.<br />But more important: Are there any downsides to dropping packets (thus being &quot;stealth&quot;) compared to rejecting packets? When it comes to ping, I realize there is a valid argument to allow it, it&#039;s just that I&#039;ve been used to stock firmwares (both Netgear and others) that defaults to not answering pings and dropping packets.</p><p>I don&#039;t need SSH access to my router from the WAN side, so I&#039;ve only enabled it on the LAN (which it defaults to, I think).</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi all, first post.</p><p>I just installed this last night on my WNDR3700 and its seems like a great breath of fresh air. I can now use IPSEC VPN and I didn&#039;t have to do anything in the settings it just worked. I could not get this working with the stock firmware.</p><p>I have a question though, I love the traffic stat tools that are available by default and I looked in the packages to see what else was available and came across bandwithd, I installed the package however I don&#039;t see anything new on the GUI of the device, however as stated I am a total noob with one days experience so far so you might no even be able to get this to work.</p><p>I have looked system/startup and I can see bandwithd however it says disabled, if I press Start, Restart and then reboot it does not load and says disabled again in the startup.</p><p>Could someone let me know what I am doing wrong, or what I need to do if this is possible, thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>I posted a while back about radios not working on some new 3700s I bought.&nbsp; Not sure what the issue was, since I was using the same build that I had been using on my older 3700, but putting the latest nightly on them fixed the issue.&nbsp; Thanks again arokh, I&#039;ve now got 4 3700s running your build, and they all work great!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;ve been using r27175 this evening, and am totally impressed by OpenWRT.&nbsp; I have everything working great, including dual channel wifi.&nbsp; But I have hit a brick wall with an issue I&#039;m experiencing.&nbsp; My wifi throughput within my LAN completely drops off when I have another (wired) client accessing the WAN.&nbsp; Specifically, when my wired NAS is downloading files via the WAN, my access via wifi to that NAS cuts down significantly compared to what it is when it&#039;s idle (my 10mb/s average transfers over wifi drops to 100-500k per second). On the stock WNDR3700 firmware, I never encountered any slow down at all; the NAS is beefy enough to handle multiple connections and disk activity.&nbsp; </p><p>Is there perhaps a setting I&#039;m missing?&nbsp; Any advice would be greatly appreciated!</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Edited: Ok, I was able to do a little more testing.&nbsp; So here&#039;s what I&#039;ve learned: </p><p>When my wired NAS is downloading from the WAN, my wifi laptop experiences very slow transfers to/from the NAS (with no other wifi activity).&nbsp; Wifi transfers from my laptop to a wired machine are fine (again, while the NAS is active).&nbsp; Wired transfers between the wired NAS and the wired machine are fine.&nbsp; Strange, right?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kaiguy</strong> on 17 Jun 2011, 10:42)</p>

					<p>Does anyone use a USB drive for additional storage, if so how do you get it to auto mount if the router is rebooted. Also what do I need to do to make sure that openwrt will use this device for storage. Could someone point me in the right direction. Do you edit the target in the software tab?</p>									</div>
