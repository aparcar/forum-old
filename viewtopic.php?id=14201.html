					<p>Hi,</p><p>We are trying to use some openwrt boxes (one Linksys WRT54GL, one RouterBoard150, both MIPS) on a network with heavy(?) IP multicast traffic.<br />The network is a 100Mbps switched ethernet, and there&#039;s a constant multicast traffic of about 10Mpbs. The IP multicast traffic appears as Ethernet broadcast.<br />The openwrt boxes should not receive multicast, so I have turned IP_MULTICAST off in their kernel.</p><p>Once connected to the network, the openwrt boxes become extremely slow, and I can see about 50-60% &quot;softirq&quot; with top.<br />(For now, there&#039;s nothing running on them just a dropbear server).<br />Again, the boxes should not receive the multicast, it is just &quot;present&quot; on the network.</p><p>If I decrease the amount of multicast (experimentally), the softirq loads go down as well, and once below cca. 20%, the boxes become responsive again. The 2 boxes behave the same way.</p><p>Questions:</p><p>1. Is this normal ? Why ? I assume the kernel should immediately drop all broadcast pkts (or not receive them at all). <br />2. Is there anything else to configure about this ?<br />3. What is &quot;high&quot; and why ? What bandwidth of &quot;coexistent&quot; multicast traffic is too high for such a box ? PCs and other devices (e.g. IPTV SetTopBoxes with similar HW) seem to have no problems on this network.</p><p>thanks,<br />Tivadar</p>									</div>
