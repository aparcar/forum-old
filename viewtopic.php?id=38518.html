					<p>Hello All,</p><p>I set up a script that establishes a SSh tunnel to a remote machine and forwards local ports to that remote machine. This operation is needed because tha router that this script operates is behing a private network and behind NAT of course. The script is called every 10 minites and check if the session is currently established, and if not, it brings it up again. This is done because the router is often restarted because of frequent power outages and&nbsp; Wireless IPS&#039;s connection drops.</p><p>Well, the problem is that when I run the script manually from the console, all the checks are parsed corretly it is working. However, when called by cron&nbsp; the checks seems not to be correctly performed leading to reconnections each time the script is run.</p><p>I set up the SHELL and PATH arguments in my cron file.</p><p>Here they are:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[root@sinemorets:~]# cat /etc/crontabs/root

# SSH-Tunnels script. This script is intended to be run by crond and check if a particular ssh tunnel is already established.
# If not, the script starts the ssh session again. 
# The tunnel is based on remote ssh port forwarding and its purpose is to provide a remote router administration
# when the device is behing 1 or more NAT other devices and no public IP is available. The remote ssh session is done to a public 
# server, from which we connect locally on the forwarded ports in order to connect to our device being far away behind private network.

## Crontab configuration for failover check every 5 minutes
