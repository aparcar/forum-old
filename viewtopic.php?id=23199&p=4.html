					<p>I finally gave up on running the current trunk version of WNDR3700, too many issues, and went back to the stock firmware. That allowed me to reinstall my WRT54GL under OpenWRT with the 2.6 kernel and dedicating the WNDR to wireless duties.</p><p>Long story short: Dual-Wan works fine on WRT54GL under the 2.6 kernel.</p><p>I do have a request: currently, Dual-Wan performs fail-over and balancing based on pinging the gateway for each link. In my case, the gateways (DSL routers) are sitting right next to the OpenWRT router, and what I would like to ping is a &quot;neutral&quot; internet host.</p><p>I tried changing (in /usr/bin/dualwan)<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>TESTGW1=`ping -c 1 -W 5 $GW1 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep round-trip | awk -F &quot;/&quot; &#039;{print $4}&#039;`</code></pre></div><p>to<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>TESTGW1=`ping -c 1 -W 5 88.191.76.115 -I $if_wan1 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep round-trip | awk -F &quot;/&quot; &#039;{print $4}&#039;`</code></pre></div><p>but since there is no default route for using the secondary gateway, my ping isn&#039;t getting through.</p><p>Do you have a suggestion? I was about to try finding two equivalent &quot;neutral&quot; hosts, settings up Dual-Wan exception rules for each (ICMP), and pinging those, but that seems like a pretty brittle method.</p>									</div>
