					<p>Hi,</p><p>- TL-WR1043ND briked<br />- can ping 192.168.1.1</p><p>Tried getting into failsafe mode but did not succeed asdescribed here:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd#failsafe.mode">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl- â€¦ lsafe.mode</a></p><p>Tried at boot sequence immediately after the SYS turns on with QSS pressed for long time, or multiple times.<br />Tried even with reset pressed multiple times (when reset holds then it restores to factory mode).<br />Unfortunately the factory mode does not reset all the configuration on the router so Luci is still displaying an error page with user or password incorrect even though it did not asked for it previously so when I go to <a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a> it redirects to the error page instantly.</p><p>Is there any other known way to get into failsafe mode with this hardware?</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>

When tried with IE which did not cache any of this information I found myself in the login screen of some original TP-LINK firmware.<br />I think that is why I was not able to boot into failsafe mode, since OpenWRT was not installed. it was overridden with a factory version.<br />Managed to update it to latest TP-LINK.</p><p>Maybe I will give it a shot for some other time, the nerves were enough for this time <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>I think the documentation is dead-wrong.</p><p>You must press the Button of the OpenWrt-Device only ONCE. But you must press it at the right moment.</p><p>The (new?) tcpdump-feature enables you get a visual on when this moment arrives. Usually it is a time widow, a couple of seconds after connecting the device to the power and also, it last only a couple of seconds, to keep boot-delay low. I think 2 seconds are frequently used.</p><p>Do as the wiki says, but<br />___REPEATEDLY___ press the QSS-Button untill you see one of the LEDs (the sys?-LED) blinking very fast<br />now: telnet 192.168.1.1</p><p>I&#039;ve done this procedure 7time the day before yesterday. It worked every time very reliable without employing tcpdump.</p><p>I think the wiki is (again) wrong, when it says you need to <strong>KEEP THE BUTTON PRESSED</strong>. You rather need to <strong>PRESS THE BUTTON REPEATEDLY</strong>. <br />There seem to be some idiot/troll that keeps writing bullshit-information into the wiki.</p>									</div>
