					<p>Hi all.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to get my old WRT54G v2 (running backfire 10.03.1) working as a simple repeater so as to extend the range of my wireless network a little farther in my long, narrow apartment.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been trying to follow <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/broadcom.repeater">these instructions on the wiki</a>.</p><p>It almost works, but I&#039;m seeing an error message &quot;Command &#039;set mssid&#039; failed: -1&quot; when I configure it for both ap and sta mode and run wifi.</p><p>Googling around a bit I found these two tickets: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/3523">3523</a> and <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/5660">5660</a>, which indicate that there isn&#039;t a fix for corerev versions prior to 9 (according to dmesg I&#039;m at corerev 7).</p><p>I also turned up a <a href="http://svn.dd-wrt.com/browser/src/router/services/networking/mssid.c">comment in the DD-WRT source code</a> suggesting that they might have found a workaround (this is pretty old, and I have no idea if it&#039;s applicable to backfire or not; they seem to be explicitly setting the interface&#039;s MAC address through the wl interface, I think?).</p><p>I&#039;ve also seen some notes that some older versions do support this mode, though.&nbsp; Can anyone tell me what version of OpenWRT I might need to drop back to in order to get the mssid stuff working?&nbsp; I was hoping&nbsp; could repurpose my old router as a range extender, and so far I haven&#039;t been able to get any of the wireless bridge / relayd / etc methods to work.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the response.&nbsp; FWIW, I wound up getting a DD-WRT build working as a wireless repeater bridge.</p>									</div>
