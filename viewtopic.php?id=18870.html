					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to set up my Fonera2 to use the two ethernet ports as a normal switch ie as part of the same lan. I understand that I could use VLAN-tagging and do software bridging but that seems a bit beside the point. The switch should be able to bridge the two ethernet ports in hardware just fine. Right?</p><p>So I tried to get rid of the whole br-lan thing and just give eth0 a static ip address like so:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface lan
   option ifname eth0
   option proto static
   option ipaddr 192.168.1.1
   option netmask 255.255.255.0</code></pre></div><p>(Note the missing &quot;option type bridge&quot;). As I intended, br-lan is not created and eth0 shows up with the correct ipaddr in ifconfig. Unfortunately, neither of the two ethernet ports respond to any pinging <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>Can anybody explain, what I&#039;m doing wrong?</p><p>Thanx in advance!<br />Hazzl</p>									</div>

					<p>I wanted to do the same, but alas, it&#039;s not that simple. You have to reconfigure the built-in switch too, in your configuration it will still send packets tagged for vlan1 or vlan2 to the cpu port, which you only chose to ignore.<br />And I still don&#039;t know how to do that...<br />My current solution is to include eth0.1 and eth0.2 in the lan-bridge, and let the cpu do the bridging.</p>									</div>
