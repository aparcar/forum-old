					<p>Hi All!</p><p>I was recently searching around for some information on OpenWRT, and generally on some difficult questions about antennas and spatial streams and things, and I found that there are some StackExchange sites where people post about OpenWRT and networking but there is no StackExchange site dedicated to open source routers, community networking, or mesh stuff.</p><p>So I also found that there&#039;s a way of making proposals about new StackExchange sites that should exist, so I proposed one for Open Source routers (i.e. OpenWRT), Community Networking and Mesh</p><p>It will not become a new StackExchange site unless it gets a bunch of supporters, so if you think it&#039;s a good idea, please go here and Follow, and ask questions that you would like to see:</p><p>area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/111278/open-source-wifi-community-networking-mesh</p><p>I think there are some major benefits using a Q&amp;A thing instead of forums:</p><p>- Very well indexed and searchable questions and answers<br />- No repeated questions or answers.<br />- Community takes care of making sure the best answer goes to the top with the voting system<br />- Good tagging system<br />- Reputation system means people rewarded for good answers and can participate in more ways</p><p>Just an idea for now - this site is *just the proposal*, so &#039;Follow&#039; to support it:</p><p>area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/111278/open-source-wifi-community-networking-mesh</p><p>m</p>									</div>
