					<p>It appears that the DHCP service on the OpenWRT (Barrier Breaker) firmware does not assign IP addresses in order, it appears to assign IP addresses completely randomly.</p><p>Why is this and can I change it so it will go in order from 100 to 240 instead of 110, 215, etc.</p>									</div>

					<p>Why is that important to you? If you want devices to get specific IP addresses I would recommend you to assign IP addresses to the respective MAC addresses to accomplish that. Otherwise the order in which addresses get assigned is completely unimportant and I do not know why you would need to worry about it.</p>									</div>

					<p>You can&#039;t, unless you patch the sources of dnsmasq and/or odhcpd. </p><p>BTW, the choosen ip address is not random, it&#039;s a hash on the MAC address. So the same MAC will always get the same IP. (Unless it&#039;s already taken)</p>									</div>
