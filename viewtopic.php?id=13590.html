					<p>Hi,<br />I&#039;ve been using wifidog on Whiterussian 0.9 for a lot of months with an average of 60 different users per day and an average of 10 simultaneously connected (sometimes 30) without any problem.<br />A month ago I&#039;ve upgraded to Kamikaze 7.09 and apparently wifidog was ok, until a lot of users tried to connect and wasn&#039;t redirected to the auth login. This wasn&#039;t regular.. sometimes it happens when the fourth client connects, sometimes in the tenth.<br />I&#039;ve tried to use Kamikaze 7.07 and the problem persists. I&#039;ve tried wifidog 1.1.3_rc1 and the problem persists. I&#039;ve tried &nbsp; &nbsp; wifidog 1.1.4-1 and NO ONE is redirected.<br />However, when the users follow the http://auth... manually they can login and access the Internet without any problem.<br />Anyone with this problem?<br />Miguel</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>miguelcma</strong> on 3 Feb 2008, 06:13)</p>

					<p>Using whiterussian isn&#039;t a good option to me because the wireless driver is bugous: some client cards crashes the router. The only option right now, for this kind of loads, is to have two routers... one with whiterussian, routing and wifidog and the other router with kamikaze and wireless.<br />And whiterussian uses nvram... argh <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,<br />I installed Wifidog on my Asus 500gp and I&#039;m a bit stuck with its configuration.
