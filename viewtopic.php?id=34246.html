					<p>Hi! I have an tp-link wr1043nd with OpenWRT. I wanted to go back to tp-link stock firmware with MTD command &quot;mtd -r write /tmp/original_firmware.bin firmware&quot; and I think I bricked it. I cannot connect to it in any way (no telnet, no ssh, no web, no wi-fi, no ethernet). The only thing that router does is: blinking constantly. The LEDS stay on for 2 seconds, then they go off for 5-6 seconds. They all do that, simultaneously. I don&#039;t know what I can do now, how can I connect to it in such a manner that will work again. Can somebody help me with my problem?</p><br /><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>I had TP-LINK WR1043ND setup just the way I like it, and it was performing just great.</p><p>Then two days ago I got a brilliant idea, why not move my iphone charger to other my work room and I&#039;ll charge iphone when in living room from WR1043ND USB port. Cool idea, right? Well it worked for two days.</p><p>Now my WR1043ND is bricked with all LED lights flashing continuously, my guess is that somehow iphone charging was cause of this, and I can blame only myself.</p><p>I&#039;ll try to fix it and report back how I&#039;m doing. I&#039;ll first try just to reflash it via serial cable, if that doesn&#039;t help I&#039;m open to suggestions.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi guys, sure I can help you. </p><p>I&#039;ve bought something like this: <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/CP2102-USB-to-TTL-Module-Serial-Converter-Module-/130923741835?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item1e7ba9c28b">http://www.ebay.com/itm/CP2102-USB-to-T … 1e7ba9c28b</a></p><p>After that, i&#039;ve opened the case, soldered 4 pins (unfortunatelly it is necessary- take care to be out of the power cable) .

					<p>Hi mottanu,</p><p>I have the v2 version of the TL-WR1043ND router and I cannot see the pins in these pictures (<a href="http://galeria.tech-blog.pl/TP-Link_TL-WR1043ND_v2/">http://galeria.tech-blog.pl/TP-Link_TL-WR1043ND_v2/</a>), as they should appear in this photo : <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/_media/inbox/wr1043ndserial.jpg">http://wiki.openwrt.org/_media/inbox/wr1043ndserial.jpg</a></p><p>Therefore I assume that you also have the v2 version.<br /><em>Could you please describe where exactly have you soldered the pins necessary for connecting the USB to TTL cable?</em></p><p>I managed to brick my v2 router two days ago just by following the instructions in the wiki while trying to revert to original fw (used the v1 stripped firmware as it was specifically mentioned there). Now the leds are flashing in a specific sequence during a 5-second duration cycle which repeats itself endlessly. I have no link on the switch nor on the WAN connector and also no WiFi. Therefore I cannot connect to it using the external interfaces.</p><p>The reason for reverting to original fw was that the Barrier Breaker (bleeding edge) firmware was causing packet drops (between 1% and 5%) on the WiFi connection, no matter the router conditions (heavy load, idle etc). The issue started to appear in approx. 3-4 minutes after a router reboot.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Cristian</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tlc</strong> on 7 Apr 2014, 07:26)</p>

					<p>Finally I got mine replaced under warranty. I also received the USB2TTL device ordered from ebay. So now I&#039;m ready to brick the replaced unit <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Next time I will use the V2 stripped firmware version to revert to original.</p>									</div>
