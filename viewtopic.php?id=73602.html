					<p>I&#039;m trying to get my device to work when its taken out of the box the first time. When it tries to send a dhcp request, option 150 should be added along so that it&#039;ll get the tftp server address from which it should download the required configuration.</p><p>Now after reading the various documentation on this topic, it seems the right approach in openwrt is to add &#039;option sendopts &lt;150&gt;&#039; in /etc/config/network. Is this the correct approach? Has anyone tried this earlier?</p>									</div>
