					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have been plowing through the forums for quite some time now, but I can&#039;t seem to find an exact answer to what I&#039;m looking for. (my apologies if I haven&#039;t been looking/searching right :-) )</p><p>My usecase:<br />I&#039;m going abroad to an appartment with the family in a few weeks. The appartment has Wifi. I want to be able to use my Netflix/chromecast combination to watch my regionally provided content and watch geolocked TV via Internet.</p><p>So in short:<br />My chromecast/laptop --&gt; &lt;device to purchase with OpenVPN client running&gt; --&gt; Wifi of appartment --&gt; OpenVPN server in my home --&gt; Internet</p><p>My research has brought me:<br />- I need a reasonable amount of RAM and flash space<br />- I need a reasonable CPU (for the OpenVPN)<br />- The device needs to be able to connect to multiple SSIDs at once</p><p>I found Kingston MLWG2, which is compact, quite cheap (about 40 euros), I however can&#039;t find if the device is capable of being both a wireless client and an access point at the same time.</p><p>Does anyone have simular needs and experiences with my usecase?</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for your concerns in regards to how I spend my holidays :-)</p><p>And yes: I have an OpenVPN Server running at home to which I want to be able to connect to from the outside world with an OpenWrt device so I can use my other devices which don&#039;t run OpenVPN clients by themselves.<br />And No: I don&#039;t have a mobile access point that can use a Wifi connection as it&#039;s WAN-side and has an OpenVPN client.</p><p>(hence my question on this forum :-) )</p>									</div>

					<p>I have and use a Kingston MLWG2 in a similar manner.&nbsp; It works good as long as you have a fast enough connection.&nbsp; I find I need to be able to get at least 6-7 Mbps thru the tunnel to watch video with good quality (tested on you tube, do not have Netflix), so you may need twice that for a connection.&nbsp; </p><p>Support is waning for this device, but it&#039;s not hard to flash.&nbsp; There are other options with dual Ethernet that will help improve speed if you can directly access the main router in the apartment.&nbsp; See the TOH<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/views/toh_extended_all?dataflt%5BDevice+Type*%7E%5D=travel">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/views/toh_ â€¦ %5D=travel</a><br />This view is supported and unsupported devices so read carefully</p>									</div>
