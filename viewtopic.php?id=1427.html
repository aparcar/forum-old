					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m running a WRT54G v1.1 behind a Cisco 1603 router to connect my hosts to the internet. The WRT54G doesn&#039;t have any routing-functions, it&#039;s just used as a accesspoint to connect all the wireless clients.<br />The Cisco box is successfully connected to Sixxs via IPv6 and has got a working IPv6-adress from an own subnet. I&#039;ve also got some computers connected directly to the switch (which means that they&#039;re not wireless and that there traffic isn&#039;t routed over the WRT54G). They recive all the IPv6-address assignments sent by the Cisco router. Thus these directly connected hosts can use IPv6 without any problems; it works just fine.</p><p>Now comes my problem .. The WRT54G (and of course all computers behind it (which means all the wireless connected computers)) doesn&#039;t recive *any* of these advertisements. For a more specific analysis I ran tcpdump on a wireless- and on a directly connected host. The directly connected host recived about 2 advertisements every second, the wireless connected host didn&#039;t recive any. I also wanted to test this directly on the WRT54G but I couldn&#039;t find a tcpdump package with IPv6-support. Anyhow I think it doesn&#039;t work there either, since the WRT54G doesn&#039;t get a IPv6-address advertised by the Cisco.</p><p>My question is: Does OpenWRT block any of these advertisements? If yes, how do I unblock them? If no, what else could be the reason for this strange behaviour?</p><p>regards,<br />phil</p>									</div>
