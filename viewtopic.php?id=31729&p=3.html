					<p>Two good news to me, one bad news to me and one bad news to all future WR703n users. <br />1. I can open the blue cover with minimum damage. Of course, you cannot expect opening a screw-less box without little brute force.<br />2. I can adhere a 0.1&quot; header to the serial console. <br />3. New 703n user cannot solder a header to the box. I use heat-conductive paste (for cell phone repairing) to adhere the header to the board. v1.2 box does not have through hole at the TP-out and TP-in. Just a small pad, little bit bigger than a resistor soldering pad.<br />4. I screw-up the network interface for my image. I cannot download a new image through the network interface, both wired and wireless.</p><p>Anybody knows how to break the u-boot of the 703n for booting?&nbsp; ESC, F1, ENTER are tried. </p><p>If the serial console can take the image, maybe possible, but I don&#039;t know how to do that.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>r32190</strong> on 19 Oct 2011, 06:03)</p>

					<p>Right.&nbsp; Should be useful for future 703n user. My serial console is broken, it is worthy to spend half an hour to do it because it indicated to me &quot;fast blinking mode&quot; is the fail-safe.&nbsp; The console for v1.2 box is very difficult to build, so I leave a more complete note here for un-brick without serial console:</p><p>1. Press the reset during power up for about 4 to 5 seconds.<br />2. The LED will start to blink within a second. If the blinking rate is normal, the fail-safe mode is&nbsp; NOT entered, repeat step 1. Fast blinking will be 4-5 beat per second.<br />3. Telnet to the box at 192.168.1.1&nbsp; . No DHCP, so you need to manually configure your PC to the 192.168.1.2 or other IP at that subnet.<br />4. Get a &quot;squash-sysupgrade.bin&quot; from the snapshot or the formal backfire in future. Get a nc (netcat) for your PC. I prefer Linux because my virus scanner does not like the Windows &quot;nc&quot;.<br />5. At PC: cat XXX.bin | nc -l 3333&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;- 3333 is an arbitrary port, any free port would be fine, something higher than 1000.<br />6. At the telnet dialog:&nbsp; &nbsp;nc 192.168.1.2 3333 &gt; /tmp/703.bin&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Copy would be finished within 5 seconds. Too short or long is no good or meaning failure.<br />7. Telnet dialog:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; cd /tmp<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; mtd -r write 703.bin firmware&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Press &quot;w&quot; repeatedly (or there may be better way) until the box reboot.</p><p>8.
