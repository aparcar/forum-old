					<p>Hi everybody, im new here.<br />my router died last night and i decided i might as well set up the pi to router for me. i have managed to get 12.09 working but i cant figure out how to get my wireless card working.<br />unfortunately my linux-fu isnt very strong and i googled everything i could find but the farthest i got was to understand that i will need to compile my own distro from source. as i said my linuxpfu isnt very strong so i would rather avoid that step if at all possible, can any one advise me to what i should do? or at least point me to a good guide that explain how to compile my own distro or driver?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>what a good chance for you to get more linux knowledge <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I&#039;m not sure wether&nbsp; the 8192cu has the ability to run in Master mode, or if Master mode is supported in OpenWRT. Atheros based hardware is often very good supported regarding Master mode, but there is a plethora of info on <a href="http://wireless.kernel.org/">http://wireless.kernel.org/</a></p><p>Other good starting points for you might be <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/user.beginner">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/user.beginner</a> and <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/raspberry_pi">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/raspberry_pi</a></p><p>HtH</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gbi</strong> on 26 Feb 2014, 10:23)</p>
