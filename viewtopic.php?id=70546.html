					<p>Hello everyone. Just flashed my WA750RE and its already working a lot better as a repeater. </p><p>I have one problem though. I cant disable the DHCP and I&#039;ve tried many guides, but with no success so far.</p><p>What I want to do is, disable the inbuilt DHCP server in the repeater, have it take an IP from the main router and also have the main router give out IPs to the connected devices to the repeater.</p><p>I tried the Dumb AP guide, but it did not work for me.</p><p>Any other ideas?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>The &quot;dumb AP&quot; requires a <strong>wired</strong> connection to the main router.&nbsp; If you try to use wifi with a standard AP--Client&nbsp; connection from a main router as the AP, you can&#039;t readily bridge back multiple users making everything on one LAN.&nbsp; This is because standard AP implies that a client is only one MAC address (one device) at the end of the link.</p><p>The relayd package attempts to work around this.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t always work very well.</p><p>If you can run OpenWrt on your main router you can use AP-WDS mode or mesh.&nbsp; These allow seamless bridging over a wifi link, because an additional MAC address of the final destination is passed back.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 11 Apr 2017, 15:45)</p>
