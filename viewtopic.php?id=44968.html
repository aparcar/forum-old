					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m just starting to see how packetfence and openwrt can be used together. So I am interested in your results, and came accross this thread.</p><p>You need to install the &quot;wpad&quot; package instead of the &quot;wpad-mini&quot; package to get radius support. So that would be likely your problem.</p><p>I&#039;ve noticed there are multiple options for using radius servers. I&#039;m already running several ap&#039;s authenticate against an MS radius server. The entries I&#039;m using at those are:</p><p>option server &#039;&lt;radius server ip&gt;&#039;<br />option port &#039;1812&#039;<br />option key &#039;&lt;secret key&gt;&#039;</p><p>I&#039;m not sure why there are different options. The above one&#039;s works perfectly for me.<br />I&#039;m running atheros cards on release r36421 (custom compiled).</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks you for your feedback, i successfully configure my access point with packetfence&nbsp; but it only work with 802.1x&nbsp; not mac-authentication.<br />The problem i have now is to change the vlan id of the device based on the tunnel attribute return by packetfence.<br />For now it just stuck in the default vlan and wpad doesn´t care about the tunnel attribute.<br />I know that it can be done with wpad (hostapd) with dynamic vlan but i can´t find the correct configuration.<br />I have build wpad with CONFIG_FULL_DYNAMIC_VLAN set to y, i just have to test.</p><p>The other point is that i have to find the way to deauth the device from packetfence, i think with CoA it can be done.</p><p>Regards<br />Fabrice</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello Hugo,<br />it is exactly what i did and it works like a charm my vlan are created when i receive a new vlan id i my radius answer.<br />So i have made test using 802.1x (wpa2 ent) and mac-authentication and i hit the captive portal when my device is unreg in packetfence. (that is perfect)<br />I don´t know why but even if i add CONFIG_FULL_DYNAMIC_VLAN=y in my configuration file and recompille openwrt, i am not able to use dynamic vlan (if you know why, i am very interested ) so i have used <a href="http://rpc.one.pl/index.php/lista-artykulow/34-openwrt/82-dynamiclvlan-w-openwrt-z-wykorzystaniem-hostapd">http://rpc.one.pl/index.php/lista-artyk … em-hostapd</a></p><p>I don´t want to explain exactly how packetfence work, but when your device is unreg then it will fall in the registration vlan and when you register your device than the vlan must be change. So the CoA is use to deauth the client to have a new radius request just after the device has been registered.<br />I have tested CoA and it´s working too, just an attribute that hostapd doesn´t understand but finally i am be able to support openwrt in PacketFence.</p><br /><p>Regards<br />Fabrice</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Fabrice,</p><p>Good to hear it&#039;s working! I&#039;m hoping to spend some time on this myself too.<br />I&#039;ve been reading about packetfence and played with it in an test environment. So i&#039;m familiair with the registration and client vlan&#039;s returned by packetfence. I have played with a wired setup so far, and got port security working with setting the correct vlan on the user&#039;s switch port. Really nice btw <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I&#039;m just unfamiliair with the term CoA. You mean this? -&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Care-of_address">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Care-of_address</a></p><p>The wired setup is quite clear to me. However, I&#039;m not sure how to implement this on a wireless network. And what the &quot;best&quot; setup should look like.</p><p>If I understand correctly, you&#039;re using radius (which came with packetfence I think?) for initial connection. Therefore an user already has to have credentials to connect to the wireless network, right? After that, you say, you hit the captive portal. At this time the user will have to logon (again)? Or was this just for testing?</p><p>In the wired setup, no 802.1x is used (in my setup). When the client connects, the port will change to the registration vlan and the user hit&#039;s the captive portal (using port security). After logging in, the port will change to the correct vlan for the client.</p><p>In an wireless setup, you should setup an open network to get to the captive portal. However, I don&#039;t think you can use vlan&#039;s when 802.1x is not used, or even be able to assign the correct vlan to the user.</p><p>Am I correct you _need_ to use 802.1x in an wireless setup? I&#039;m sorry, but I just cannot get this part clear for myself. Hope you understand what I mean...</p><p>Regards,<br />Hugo</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m just reading that you indeed need to configure 2 ssid&#039;s. One &quot;open&quot; with an registration portal, and another for registered clients. My guess is you need to configure the 802.1x authentication on the last one.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello Hugor,</p><p>in fact by CoA i mean <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5176">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5176</a> .<br />And no, you don´t have to have more than one ssid , one for registration and another one for registered user.<br />In fact the process is like that (for mac-auth):<br />Device -&gt; connection openssid -&gt; mac-auth -&gt; radius request -&gt; packetfence return vlan reg -&gt; captive portal -&gt; username/password -&gt; CoA to deauth -&gt; radius request -&gt; packetfence return the normal vlan.<br />For dot1x it´s not exactly the same workflow but it´s close, but usefull if you want to do machine auth or/and user auth to active directory.<br />So on the same ssid your device can be on the registration vlan or in the normal vlan.</p><p>I use this configuration for mac-auth:<br />interface=wlan0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />ctrl_interface=/var/run/hostapd-phy0<br />disassoc_low_ack=1<br />auth_algs=1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />wpa=0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />ssid=OpenWrt&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />bridge=br-lan&nbsp; <br />wmm_enabled=1&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />bssid=dc:9f:db:5c:5d:66<br />ignore_broadcast_ssid=0<br />auth_server_addr=192.168.0.1<br />auth_server_port=1812<br />auth_server_shared_secret=secret<br />macaddr_acl=2&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />dynamic_vlan=2&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />vlan_file=/etc/config/hostapd.vlan<br />vlan_tagged_interface=eth0<br />radius_das_port=3799 <br />radius_das_client=192.168.0.1 secret</p><p>Also i did the code to support openwrt in packetfence but i haven´t commit yet in github.</p><p>regards,<br />Fabrice</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Fabrice,</p><p>Thanks for your explanation. That sounds like a real nice setup.<br />I thought (due to my limited knowledge offcourse), you had to use dot1x in order to use radius auth at all. If I understand correctly, this is not the case.<br />I seriously have to expand my knowledge about this, as I&#039;m interested to know how this works.<br />I hope I have some time this week to get into this again.</p><p>Thank you for sharing your config as this really helps me understanding.</p><p>Are you planning to make a pull request for this enhancement in packetfence?

					<p>Hello Hugo,<br />yes i am a developer of packetfence, i am working at inverse so i will make a new branch for hostapd/openwrt support.<br />The modification on packetfence are easy to do, i just have to make an hostapd´s perl switch module that support 802.1x , mac-auth and CoA deauth method and of course make a documentation.<br />My problem now is to support unsupported configuration parameter in uci, i just find that i have to modify the script /lib/wifi/hostapd.sh to support these new parameters like radius_das_port ...<br />I will keep you in the loop with this thread and maybe you will be my best beta tester :-)</p><p>Regards<br />Fabrice</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Fabrice,</p><p>It&#039;s very nice to hear that the support for hostapd (and openwrt) is already in de devel branch. Also the news article on the packetfence website explains it all very clear. I&#039;m really surprised that this all is integrated really fast! Big thanks!</p><p>I&#039;m currently compiling openwrt (latest from 12.09 branch) for my new atheros based access point. The wpad package you mention (on the rpc.one.pl page) however is a bit outdated I think. It seems for the 10.03 release of openwrt. The current stable is at 12.09. I had some patches in the past for the wpad package to support dynamic vlans, but I&#039;m not sure they are still needed. I first will test without the patch.<br />I&#039;ve made a patch file of your hostapd.sh file, since it seems that the current hostapd.sh in the source repo of openwrt is slightly different.<br />If my tests are successfull I will report back offcourse.</p><p>Also I&#039;m more than happy to contribute to the project, so if I can help to test things out, please ask.<br />I do not however run a large wifi network or something like that. Currently I do not even have Packetfence in production. We have a small office and offer wifi services for our guests, so perhaps this will be replaced by packetfence in the future. But it still be some kind of overkill probably.<br />I&#039;m not much of a programmer, but I am familiair with patches, compiling and administrating linux devices/servers.</p><p>In my spare time I am a volunteer at a local (outside) event, where I will provide internet access for the crew during the week (wired and wireless). I am hoping to use Packetfence for this, as this will be a great learning setup for me.</p><p>I will update with my findings.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Hugo</p>									</div>

					<p>By the way. Instead of providing custom openwrt images (as you mention on the website). Wouldn&#039;t it be better to submit the changes to the openwrt community? This way there&#039;s no need for custom installations and there are ton&#039;s of installation images so it would be hard to support them all I guess.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello Fabrice,</p><p>Yesterday evening I did some testing. Not yet completed everything, but I would like to give a follow up.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure what&#039;s going on with the hostapd package. Dynamic vlans seem to work fine without any patches on my side. I don&#039;t see the config errors you posted, and hostapd redirects to the correct vlan (as shown in de log on the ap). I&#039;ve checked out the latest source from the attitude_adjustment branch, and only modified the hostapd.sh file with your modifications. After the mods, I&#039;ve created an patch file for future use, but this one is not tested yet (but should be ok). The patch file is located here: <a href="http://linuxbak.nl/openwrt/patches/packetfence-hostapd.sh.patch">http://linuxbak.nl/openwrt/patches/pack … d.sh.patch</a>.<br />When I look at the hostapd-full.config file, CONFIG_FULL_DYNAMIC_VLAN is already set to &quot;Y&quot;. See: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/branches/attitude_adjustment/package/hostapd/files/hostapd-full.config">https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/branche … ull.config</a><br />Perhaps this is different in older revisions?<br />Also you need to install the &quot;wpad&quot; package instead of the default &quot;wpad-mini&quot;. I assume you did that also? the wpad-mini package does not support radius auth and all. But in that case, you would have got errors about the radius config parameters.<br />Which release/revision do you use?</p><p>Also I upgraded my packetfence with the latest daily snapshot. After that I could create an &quot;hostapd&quot; switch.<br />If I&#039;m correct, I should choose &quot;Radius&quot; as deauth method.</p><p>The only thing that does not work at the moment is the CoA part. If I connect with an client the first time, the client is redirected to the registration vlan. When I register, nothing happens on the radius and openwrt side. The packetfence log says that the client should be pushed into vlan 10 (which is what I&#039;ve configured), but nothing happens.</p><p>When I manually disconnect, and connect again, radius returns vlan 10, and the client get&#039;s an IP from my DHCP in vlan 10. That part definetly works.</p><p>After troubleshooting I noticed that freeradius is not listening on the CoA port. I&#039;ve enabled that by symlinking sites-available/coa to sites-enabled/coa. After that, it still didn&#039;t work. So I have to figure out why. At that time it was really past bed time, so I stopped at that part, and will continue later.</p><p>Hugo</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hugor</strong> on 19 Jul 2013, 11:04)</p>

					<p>Hello Hugo,<br />yes you are right, in the last 12.09 branch dynamic vlan is enable so i´am currently build a new firmware to test.</p><p>For the CoA in fact it´s not on the freardius side but in the access point that CoA must be enable, it´s why we add in wifi profil:<br />radius_das_port=3799<br />radius_das_client=192.168.1.10 s3cr3t</p><p>If you want to try manually disconnect your device you can do this from the freeradius server:</p><p>Create a file pod.txt</p><p>Calling-Station-Id = &quot;00:23:6c:90:cb:1c&quot;<br />Service-Type = &quot;Login-User&quot;</p><p>And launch</p><p>cat pod.txt | radclient -x 192.168.1.10:3799 disconnect s3cr3t </p><p>Fabrice</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Fabrice,</p><p>Yes, I misunderstood how CoA works. I got it now <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>For some reason I was unable to deauth the station with the method you described.<br />What does work for me however is:</p><p>(echo Calling-Station-Id = &quot;&lt;mac of client&gt;&quot;<br />Service-Type = &quot;Login-User&quot;) |<br />radclient -x &lt;ip of ap&gt; disconnect testing123</p><p>This ends up quite the same, and not really important, but it might help someone in the future.</p><p>There is however a tiny mistake in your how-to on the packetfence website. The uci commands you specify, create the wrong config items. You mention &quot;add_list&quot; commands, but that creates the wrong statements in the config file. I&#039;m not using the &quot;uci&quot; command very much myself, I&#039;d rather config the files directly. My config looks like this:</p><p>config wifi-iface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;radio0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option mode &#039;ap&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ssid &#039;test-OPEN1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option encryption &#039;none&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option macfilter &#039;2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option auth_port &#039;1812&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option auth_server &#039;172.30.50.41&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option auth_secret &#039;testing123&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option dynamic_vlan &#039;2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan_file &#039;/etc/config/hostapd.vlan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan_tagged_interface &#039;eth0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option radius_das_port &#039;3799&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option radius_das_client &#039;172.30.50.41 testing123&#039;</p><br /><p>Having all configured, everything is working quite nice. After logging in on the portal, the client is redirected to the correct vlan.<br />One setting i&#039;m not sure of though. Perhaps you can advice.<br />When I configure the new hostapd device, I can select an deauth method, or leave this empty. What should I specify here?</p><p>I will do some more testing in my test environment to get familiar with everything, but it looks very promising so far!<br />So thanks again for all the effort and help.</p><br /><p>Hugo</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello Hugo,<br />sorry i was a little bit busy.<br />So you can select RADIUS as the deauth method but it&#039;s not really important there is only one deauth method for hostapd module.<br />I have added the documentation in the network admin guide of PacketFence with the correct parameters.</p><p>Now i make all my test with openwrt and packetfence and it look like stable.<br />Thanks for your test.</p><p>Regards<br />Fabrice</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello Fabrice,</p><p>Thanks for your reply.<br />I&#039;m still setting up the environment (side project, so I&#039;m working on it when I have some spare time), but it&#039;s working stable and I haven&#039;t got any weird issues.<br />I&#039;m glad I could help the project a bit by testing this out.</p><p>Regards,<br />Hugo</p>									</div>

					<p>Hy, sorry for offtopic and please excuse my poor english. Is it posible to use vlan names as response from radius ? </p><p>I mean my freeradius responds with&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Tunnel-Private-Group-Id:0 = &quot;vlan.full&quot;</code></pre></div><p>i have tryed something like this in hostapd.conf:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>vlan.full            wlan0.110
vlan.limited      wlan0.111
*           wlan0.#</code></pre></div><p>but hostapd wont start...</p><p>Dont get me wrong, if i setup radius to respond with vlan id (like Tunnel-Private-Group-Id:0 = &quot;110&quot;) and default hostapd.conf it works corectly.</p><p>Maybe somone has any idea how to patch this.
