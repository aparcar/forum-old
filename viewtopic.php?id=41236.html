					<p>Hello all,</p><p>I&#039;m a new user to OpenWRT. I got it up and running without issue on my Netgear WNDR3800. Everything seems to be working great so far, but I noticed that my internet was slower than usual. I headed over to speedtest.net to test the connection, and it&#039;s showing that (after several tests), I&#039;m getting anywhere between 12-15 Mbps down on average. My connection is normally in the 50 meg range. </p><p>Upload speeds appear to be fine.</p><p>To narrow it down, I connected the modem directly to my computer, and tried another Netgear I had lying around with the stock firmware. In both cases, download speeds returned to normal. To isolate it to the wireless on the router running OpenWRT, I ran a patch cable from the router to my PC. Again, download speeds are normal. So it appears to be a wireless issue.</p><p>Any suggestions? I&#039;m basically brand new to OpenWRT so aside from what I&#039;ve already done, I really don&#039;t know where I should be looking and what I should be testing. If it helps, I haven&#039;t made any changes to the default OpenWRT config and my ISP is Comcast (I&#039;m in the US).</p><p>Any and all help is appreciated.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sirchuckoftron</strong> on 23 Dec 2012, 04:26)</p>

					<p>Try recent trunk.

					<p>Update:</p><p>I got OpenWrt running on a Buffalo router (WZR-HP-G300NH) and while things seem to overall be better, I&#039;m still having some issues with the wireless. Speeds are generally faster than they were before with the Netgear I had running OpenWrt before, but still far below what they were running stock firmware. I tried disabling the &#039;noscan&#039; option in the wireless config, and that did not appear to have any effect. I was always using WPA2/PSK with AES so nothing has changed there. </p><p>I have not yet had a chance to install a recent trunk, but I will soon and report back.</p><p>For whatever it&#039;s worth, I fired up Wireshark and noticed that while browsing the web, I see a LOT of &#039;dup ack&#039;, and retransmitted packets. Of course, these accompany the slowdown I get when using wireless. Perhaps the driver is the culprit?</p><p>I will try trunk and report back with results.</p><p>As always, I appreciate the help.</p><p>EDIT: Forgot to say that I did try different wireless channels. In my testing this did not make a difference either. Just mentioning this for tracking purposes.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sirchuckoftron</strong> on 30 Dec 2012, 06:36)</p>
