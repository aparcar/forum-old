					<p>Hello everyone,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m looking for an all-in-one battery powered MiFi device that would allow me to share my 4G/3G plan over WiFi.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve been using openwrt on Hame MPR-A2 (and MPR-A1 clones) with external usb modems and it works pretty well but it&#039;s a bit bulky, not so reliable and the battery is not powerfull enough to last a whole day.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;So far, I found 2 devices that can work with openwrt:<br />- Hame Noah Ark (MPR-A19)<br />- Hame A16</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Noah Ark (A19) would have been a great candidate, unfortunately, it only has 4MB flash and 16MB RAM (I can upgrade the flash but the RAM would be pretty tricky to replace as it&#039;s pretty close (1mm) to the main BGA SoC ).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I believe the A16 has the same specs.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyone knows of any real MiFi (with integrated radio) that is (or can be) compatible with openwrt? Idealy I&#039;d love one with 4G or up to date 3G (42MBps) but anything 3G+ would suit me...</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>If you go for battery uptime, what about perfectly supported TL-WR703N + power bank? I have seen mods with more flash/ram at aliexpress or you can DIY. I&#039;d recommend maybe combination of power bank + solar charger.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 17 Jan 2015, 00:16)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m already using a Hame MPR-A2 which has a 5200mAh Battery while remaining &amp; portable - it does work beautifully. I have a few TL-WR703N for other tasks though...</p><p>Anyway, all those &quot;solutions&quot; still require an USB plugged modem. I&#039;m looking for an all-in one solution such as the Hame Ark (A19).</p>									</div>
