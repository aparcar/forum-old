					<p>Aside from things like client isolation, etc. is there any real benefit to infrastructure mode versus ad-hoc mode on a wireless radio in terms of performance? In this scenario, objective is for many clients to communicate with one server with a radio onboard. Clients do not need to speak to each other, although it is not be harmful.</p><p>I have some Intel Pro 5100 and 5300 MiniPCI-e cards which seem not to support acting as an access point. Possibly I am missing something, but it seems like there&#039;s no access point mode. At the same time, I&#039;m unsure why it would be necessary given the objective of having many clients talk with one server.</p><p>OpenWRT systems would be the clients - if you can call them that.</p><p>A few thoughts would be appreciated here!</p>									</div>

					<p>With ad-hoc you may encounter the following nasty issues:<br />1) Some wi-fi equipment (PDAs, some cards on some chipsets, especially old ones or just with unusual chip sets, drivers, ...) can use ad-hoc mode ONLY with ancient 802.11b mode, which is very s-l-o-w. I&#039;m not aware why this limitation exists but encountered it few times. <br />2) Various wi-fi equipment may have some strange\stupid limitations (in drivers, firmware, etc) so in Ad-Hoc mode either no encryption at all or you can use insecure WEP only as very most in many cases. Most secure WPA and especially WPA2 auth\encryption could be unavailable in such setups, depending on devices on both sides of link and their drivers\firmwares.<br />3) Often there is limitation how many such links one wi-fi device can maintain. Many APs and routers (based on Broadcom, Atheros) can take part only in single ad-hoc network. Then usually no other activity can take place in same time on same adapter. Compare this to let&#039;s say, up to 4 virtual APs running 4 wi-fi networks + 1 client connect on single card (quite common for Atheros and Broadcom based routers).</p><p>If all this is not a problem (for example, your equipment performs well, haves all desired features and does not suffers from stupid limits) you can use ad-hoc networks. As for me, ad-hoc usually less comfortable to use and manage than AP-based networks and there is more chances to encounter some strange issues or limitations in this mode.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Drone</strong> on 8 Apr 2009, 19:54)</p>
