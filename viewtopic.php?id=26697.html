					<p>The brcm47xx &quot;squashfs&quot; image (openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx) contains a squashfs root filesystem (read-only) and a jffs2 filesystem overlay.&nbsp; Any changes you make to the rootfs will be written to the jffs overlay.&nbsp; If you want a jffs only image, you&#039;ll have to build your own image... but it may not fit on your flash.</p><p>I think the prebuilt &quot;squashfs&quot; image is what you want.</p>									</div>

					<p>The problem is, that I need to have a number of packages in the filesystem, before the overlay is mounted, so that my usb stick will be mounted as overlay. It is packages as kmod-ext2 kmod-ext3 e2fsprogs block-mount block-extroot&nbsp; kmod-usb2 kmod-ohci kmod-usb-storage.</p><p>So I need a squashfs-image with these packages, or a jffs-only image for that. The former is not practical to prebuilt, because users will have individual wishes to filesystems, usb1/2 and so on. </p><p>I just wonder, why there is no prebuilt jffs-image for the brcm47xx-taget, but both jffs and jffs2-images are prebuilt for e.g. ar7, ar71xx, atheros</p>									</div>

It works with the current Backfire branch, r23591, which still has a 2.6.32 kernel but includes important backported fixes from the trunk, with which WLAN seems to work fine, at least in station (client) mode. (I have not tried access point mode.) I tried with ext3 first, then upgraded to ext4, and no hanging.</p><p>Because there seems to be no image builder for the current version of the Backfire branch, you will have to build the image yourself, but the above-mentioned instructions will work as long as you don&#039;t repeat my mistake of trying them on the trunk instead of the Backfire branch. You can check out the latter like so:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>svn co svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/branches/backfire</code></pre></div><p>I got rid of all PPP-related packages and enabled these for extroot <em>to be built into the image</em>: block-extroot block-mount e2fsprogs kmod-scsi-core kmod-usb-core kmod-usb-ohci kmod-usb-uhci kmod-usb-storage kmod-usb2 kmod-fs-ext2 kmod-fs-ext3 kmod-fs-ext4. I also decided to skip the FPU emulation so I can install the binary packages from the official repository. Let me know if you want me to email or post my config file. The build can take a while, so you can watch a Tatort episode or whatever keeps you from staring at the screen.</p><p>The end result looks like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@chatito:~# uname -a
Linux chatito 2.6.32.16 #3 Sat Oct 23 18:07:02 CDT 2010 mips GNU/Linux
root@chatito:~# mount | grep sda
/dev/sda1 on /overlay type ext4 (rw,sync,relatime,barrier=1,data=ordered)

mini_fo:/overlay          2048      2048         0 100% /</code></pre></div><p>Now I can finally start the real work, which is using these devices in some fun ways.</p><p>Btw, if you don&#039;t see the this kind of overlay mount (on /dev/mtdblock3) on the very first boot, it probably means your image is too big. It took me forever to figure that out. </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/dev/mtdblock3            1536      1040       496  68% /overlay
mini_fo:/overlay          1536      1536         0 100% /</code></pre></div><p>That&#039;s also the reason why there are no jffs-only images for devices with only 8MB flash.</p>									</div>
