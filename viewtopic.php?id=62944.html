					<p>If you know the IP addresses to be blocked, you can just use firewall to block traffic. No need for an additional router.</p><p>You can add the blocking rule to the firewall config by hand. Example in wiki:<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/firewall?s">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/firewall?s</a>[]=firewall#block_access_to_a_specific_host<br />The example below blocks traffic for a specific site (<a href="http://www.mtv3.fi">www.mtv3.fi</a>):<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config rule
        option enabled &#039;1&#039;
        option src &#039;lan&#039;
        option dest &#039;wan&#039;
        option name &#039;blockMTV3&#039;
        option dest_ip &#039;178.217.129.234&#039;
        option target &#039;REJECT&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Or use Luci to set it. I used Luci to creating the above rule. <br />(Network - Firewall - Traffic rules - &quot;new forward rule&quot; - edit rule. When editing, you need to set the &quot;destination address&quot; to the IP and &quot;action&quot; to silent &quot;drop&quot; or feedback-providing &quot;reject&quot;)</p><p>If you have a long list of addresses, then you might consider using one of the adblock packages. E.g. the &quot;adblock&quot; package does the same and also makes sure that a possible www browser gets feedback and does not just wait for the page to load the whole timeout.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you hnyman, I thought so, but wasn&#039;t sure.</p><p>I may need to use a separate router to do this because my main router doesn&#039;t have this extensive firewall capability, and isn&#039;t OpenWRT compatible to install OpenWRT.</p><p>I can get a 2 Ethernet port nano router to use as this &#039;filter-router&#039; between my cable modem and the main router for around $25 USD, so it&#039;s not a problem.</p><p>If I turn off DHCP on it, and give it a STATIC IP address, I don&#039;t think it should cause any problems with being between the modem and main router.&nbsp; Am I correct?<br />Or do you have anything regarding that, I should know about it?</p>									</div>

					<p>One more thing I wanted to make sure that is understood...<br />The IP addresses I&#039;m needing to block are the INCOMING traffic ...not outgoing.</p><p>They are from hackers trying to get into various ports on my router, like 5050 and 520<br />So there&#039;s no URL (name) associated with them.</p><p>I hope the firewall also has provisions to block separate <strong>incoming</strong> IP #&#039;s as easily as it seems for the outgoing traffic too.&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I&#039;ll be adding these as they show-up on my router log, (one-at-a-time) so I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll need to create or add any Adblock package, with text lists to load in.</p>									</div>

					<p>LInux has special solution for dealing with large ip lists. Its called ipset.<br />No sure about direct luci support but openwrt&#039;s firewall support ipsets in /etc/config/firewall</p>									</div>
