					<p>I have been running White Russian on my Linksys WRTG54 for a few months now on a Time Warner Cable modem with zero problems.&nbsp; Last week we switched over to Bell South DSL and I&#039;m no longer operational, we got the &quot;Westell DSL2 + router&quot;&nbsp; and I hooked it up to the linksys just like it was with the cable and the router doesn&#039;t seem to be able to connect to the modem.&nbsp; Everthing inside my network is still functional, file sharing, print sharing, etc.&nbsp; I&#039;m just not getting anything from the outside world.&nbsp; My roommate hooked up his Apple Airport and it works fine, except its not compatible with any of my P2P software.&nbsp; Any ideas as to what can be causing the problem?&nbsp; I can&#039;t find an owners manual for the DSL modem, I was thinking maybe there is something peculiar about it.... Any ideas?</p>									</div>

					<p>sounds like ip addressing problems.&nbsp; if the new box is a dsl modem + router than it could also be trying to assign a DHCP address at the same time as your old linksys.</p><p>I would recommend you attempt to make a static IP from within the openwrt admin console&#039;s WAN area.&nbsp; If that doesn&#039;t work, than try to disable DHCP on the new router.</p>									</div>

					<p>I tried turning off DHCP with no success.&nbsp; I think my next attempt will be to put the modem in Bridge mode and try and get the Linksys to handle the PPPoE.&nbsp; What do you think?</p>									</div>
