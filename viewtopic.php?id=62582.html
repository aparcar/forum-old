					<p>Hi,</p><p>I need to determine the MAC address of the <em>br-lan</em> interface in my application running on AA 12.09.1 and wanted to change the <em>ifconfig ... | sed ...</em> way of figuring it out into an <em>ubus</em> call using the <em>devstatus</em> cmd.</p><p>On the Ubiquiti UniFi AP, which has only one interface configured to be <em>wan</em> I nevertheless use a <em>br-lan</em> bridge with only the <em>wlan0</em> interface as a single member (reason for this is that I want to be able to assign more virtual wifi interfaces to the bridge using a configuration script and I need a single interface name for both cases, either with only one or with more interfaces bridged together).</p><p>Howver, if I try to get the MAC address using <em>devstatus</em>, I get some weird address, while <em>ifconfig</em> shows the correct addresses for the <em>br-lan</em> and&nbsp; its member <em>wlan0</em>:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># ifconfig br-lan
br-lan    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 24:A4:3C:A3:B9:25  
...
# ifconfig wlan0
wlan0     Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 24:A4:3C:A3:B9:25
...
# brctl show
bridge name    bridge id        STP enabled    interfaces
br-lan        7fff.24a43ca3b925    no        wlan0
...
# devstatus br-lan
{
    &quot;external&quot;: false,
    &quot;present&quot;: true,
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Bridge&quot;,
    &quot;up&quot;: true,
    &quot;link&quot;: true,
    &quot;bridge-members&quot;: [
        &quot;wlan0&quot;
    ],
    &quot;mtu&quot;: 1500,
    &quot;macaddr&quot;: &quot;aa:9d:55:d9:ab:d1&quot;,
...</code></pre></div><p><em>devstatus wlan0</em> shows again the correct address, but why does it give this weird number on <em>br-lan</em>? If I add the <em>eth0</em> interface as a member of the bridge (for a quick test only) it also shows the last address shown above. On other platforms I use (WRT160NL, WDR4300) it works as expected, only on UniFi AP it shows this behavior.</p><p>Is this a bug or am I doing something wrong here?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>R1D2</strong> on 6 Feb 2016, 15:38)</p>

					<p>The br-lan interface is a virual interface -- it does not exist as hardware. Thus the MAC address must be made up. It has to come from somewhere. It my come from another physical interface on the host or just be randomly generated. Different hardware platforms may have different methods of doing this depending upon the hardware.</p>									</div>

However, my question was:</p><p>Why does <em>ifconfig br-lan</em> (and also an icotl(fd, SIOCGIFHWADDR, ...) on <em>br-lan</em> return the &quot;correct&quot; MAC address 24:A4:3C:A3:B9:25, while <em>devstatus</em> (and only <em>devstatus</em>!) displays the MAC address AA:9D:55:D9:AB:D1? The latter macaddr does not show up elsewhere and it is definitely not used to address the interface.</p><p>Furthermore, this only happens on Ubiquiti UniFi AP running OpenWRT 12.09.1, not on any other router I tried so far under 12.09.1, e.g. TL-WDR 4300.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>R1D2</strong> on 8 Feb 2016, 14:32)</p>

					<p>Oh, I get it now. My apologies for not fully comprehending the question.</p><p>I have no idea. You would have to dive into the code to see where ubus is getting the ethernet address. I&#039;ve never seen that problem myself.</p><p>To the best of my knowledge, devstatus is just a script that calls ubus anyway. This could be a ubus bug and you should definitely follow it and maybe send a bug/email over to jow.</p>									</div>

Yes, I will do so if the bug appears also on latest versions. Will have to verify this soemtime later.</p><p>But for now, I&#039;m in doubt whether I should transfer my application to last stable CC, because I&#039;m already fighting with this whole ubus/netifd/procd transition (re ubus/netifd even on AA). It breaks so many things, which used to work in older versions (e.g. HW watchdog support broken on some platforms, watchdog can&#039;t be disabled anymore on all platforms, mount cmd/fstab not working anymore, wrong UUID generation for different partitions in block-mount, USB LED state manipulation moved out of hotplug2 etc.). It&#039;s really hard to keep up with those changes in an app which uses those functions and beside of this, I think it is definitely the wrong way to put all those separate functions into one program or one concept.</p>									</div>
