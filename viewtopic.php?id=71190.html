					<p>Hi,</p><p>i just flashed the 15.05.1 on my DIR-645.<br />When i connect the router to another wifi (as client), this works and when i connect my computer via cable to the router i get internet access.<br />But i want to use it as a wifi repeater, so i create a second (master) wifi network. The Problem is, when i create that second network, i cant see it on other devices. When i deactivate the client network, the Master network is visible.<br />Any suggestions how to make it work?</p><p>Another question: When i flash the newest snapshot (openwrt-ramips-rt3883-dir-645-squashfs-factory) i dont get to see the gui of the router when i want to access it via 192.168.1.1, is that normal?</p><p>Kind regards <br />Thomas</p>									</div>
