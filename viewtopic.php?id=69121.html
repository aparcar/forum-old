					<p>Its typical Indian OEM brand with no specific model no but the board is manufactured in china.

So it should work as long as I use a build with bare min packages. I only need this to work as WiFi Repeater/AP and nothing more. As I&#039;ve another OpenWRT router to use in combination.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>i0s</strong> on 2 Jan 2017, 22:17)</p>

But, I strongly advice you to make a wise move without messing up the firmware as you got at least something to work out. But,If you mess up with memories then no one can help I guess.

As of now you&#039;ve some progress and know some things and from now on its better to breakdown the questions and post them. The main reason is its not a popular router and so we&#039;ve to post the questions based on the internal hardware.</p><p>Posting specific to hardware will be more helpful in times when you&#039;re posting the forums dedicated to particular brand.<br />So, as you said there is Ubi device, I would pretty much try posting it there by mentioning the SoC and RAM rather the model no. Also, you may have to face some No&#039;s as they don&#039;t support thirdparty firmwares like OpenWRT and at that time you&#039;ve to ask them If they can help you get airOS and see what they say <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> a u turn is likely!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>i0s</strong> on 24 Jan 2017, 12:10)</p>
