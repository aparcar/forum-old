					<p>Hi,</p><p>I tried to find information on the internet as to the performance of mini-pci cards compared to integrated chipsets.&nbsp; Does anyone have experience with this?&nbsp; </p><p>I&#039;m setting up a rather big network and I want to use openwrt.&nbsp; Client nodes can be cheapest possible (integrated) but I was wondering if it&#039;s better to use mini-pci cards for the AP&#039;s like Mikrotik&#039;s Routerboards.</p><p>Any information would help.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Performance?</p><p>One can be replaced, the other can&#039;t.&nbsp; Beyond that, it depends on each implementation.&nbsp; The PCI bus won&#039;t change performance, much, and some integrated controllers even sit on the PCI bus (network and USB controllers on motherboards are just hardwired PCI devices).</p>									</div>
