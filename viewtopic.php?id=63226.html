					<p>I&#039;m in an old (1891 vintage) flat with walls that attenuate WiFi, and a challenging rf environment due to all the other WiFi boxen in the area. As a result cannot get a good signal in the &quot;media room&quot; where I need it. I have a BT router with WiFi, but it&#039;s located at a point about 12-15 meters from the media room. </p><p>The media room has an Ethernet jack that is cabled to one of the Ethernet ports. I thought I could take advantage of this using my GL-AR150 configured as a &quot;Dumb AP&quot; iaw the recipe here: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap</a>. I used Luci to make the config changes, connected the LAN port of the GL-AR150, and I now have a good strong WiFi signal in my media room.</p><p>This works after a fashion, but doesn&#039;t achieve all of my objectives: </p><ul><li><p>I want the Dumb AP to be &quot;transparent&quot; such that when I wander around the flat I don&#039;t have to decide if I should be connected to the BT router&#039;s WiFi radio, or the GL-AR150&#039;s WiFi radio</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>I want to use the WAN port on the GL-AR150 to connect the TV in the media room to the BT router&#039;s Ethernet port. I used Luci to bridge the WAN interface with the LAN port, but the TV wasn&#039;t able to connect using either DHCP or manual configurations --- ??? I&#039;m obviously missing a step. </p></li></ul><p>Any advice or suggestions are appreciated.</p><p>Best Rgds</p>									</div>

					<p>Objective 1 is called &quot;roaming&quot;; you just need to give the same SSID and password to both AP&#039;s, and your devices are supposed to always choose the AP with the strongest signal. Changing from one AP to the other while you wander around the flat should also work out of the box, but some devices tend to stick to one AP, even if the signal is too weak.</p><p>I would configure the switch in the device to have just one eth0 interface, then bridge it with the WLAN; it should then be completely transparent to your TV.</p>									</div>

But in any event I&#039;ve connected the LAN port to an Ethernet port on the BT hub; a &quot;wireless repeater&quot; wouldn&#039;t have worked because the BT router&#039;s WiFi signal is very weak in the media room. I&#039;m assuming that this is OK/SOP - that&#039;s how I read the recipe referenced in the link in the OP. </p><p>Anyway, back to the TV:&nbsp; As I&#039;ve only two eth interfaces, and one of them is used to connect the GL-AR150 LAN port to the BT router, I need the WAN port to feed the TV. Is this do-able? If so, can I do it by bridging the WAN to the LAN/WiFi port?</p>									</div>

					<p>There is no &quot;switch&quot; on the AR150.&nbsp; </p><p>I am not an expert and not tried this, but if you want to use both the Ethernet ports on the AR-150 as LAN I think what you want to do is delete the WAN6 interface and then go into the LAN interface =&gt; Physical Settings and add the Ethernet Adapter @wan and maybe eth0 to the already checked eth1 and wireless network.</p><p>Mine is not exactly stock, so this may not be accurate.&nbsp; You may want to check here:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.gl-inet.com/forums/">http://www.gl-inet.com/forums/</a></p><p>Make a backup first!</p>									</div>
