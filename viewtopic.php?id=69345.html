					<p>hello devs</p><p>I know openwrt kamikaze is quite old and one should use newer version, but I have still a router with kamikaze (act as musicplayer) running fine except one package (scmpc = last.fm srobbler). it isn&#039;t running anymore because the protocol v1 of last.fm is dumped. so I need to make some changes in scmpc and compile it again for kamikaze.</p><p>I installed the environment to compile for chaos calmer on ubuntu mate 15, so in general I know how to cross compile. but after getting the sources of kamikaze I can&#039;t update the package feeds and also make command is different and not working. is there a chance to compile my package for kamikaze again with less effort? if so please help me with some steps to go.</p><p>thanks j</p>									</div>
