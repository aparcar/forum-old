					<p>Hi. I&#039;m getting a family member a new 802.11n network, and since I&#039;ve had good experiences with OpenWRT in my own (802.11g) network, I&#039;ll be looking for something that works with OpenWRT in this case aswell.</p><p>Below is a list of N-hardware that is easily accessible at my geographical location, and also in the &quot;Supported&quot; section of the TOH. I&#039;d appreciate any suggestions, thoughts or experiences regarding the hardware listed (or recommendations outside the list). The unit will only be used as a WLAN access point and a wired router coming in to the house (no file serving or anything like that). Stability and transfers speeds matter the most, and I&#039;d like to use Backfire (preferably released versions, but I can use trunk if neccessary). Since this is not for my own use, I&#039;d like something that&#039;s easily flashable without opening the container and soldering. Radio conditions could be a bit problematic, so a good radio is preferable.</p><p>Easily available hardware in my price range:<br />* D-Link DIR-615<br />* [s]D-Link DIR-300[/s] (Oops, this isn&#039;t an n-unit)<br />* (Netgear WNR3500L, listed as WIP)<br />* Linksys WRT160NL (listed under supported, but wiki page says &quot;work in progress&quot; - comment?)<br />* TP-Link TL-WR1043ND<br />* D-Link DIR-825 (a bit in the high end of my price range, but if it&#039;s good...)<br />* Netgear WNDR3700 (a bit in the high end of my price range, but if it&#039;s good...)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gspr</strong> on 9 Dec 2010, 11:15)</p>

					<p>Did you ever consider an inexpensive Seagate <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/seagate/dockstar">DockStar</a> that can be turned into even a 3G/4G WiFi router using a 3G/4G USB2 WiFi dongle through one of its USB2 port? You can even hook gIGE switch to its 10/100/1000Mbps RJ45 port to share the connection. The best part of this is this device come with a whoping 128MB RAM. With that amount of RAM, the router will operate smoother, let alone to host a lot of applications, i.e. <a href="http://asterisk.org">Asterisk</a> / <a href="http://freeswitch.org">FreeSWITCH</a> PBX System, etc.</p>									</div>

Thanks for telling me about it! However, since it costs as much as some of the devices I list above (at least in my country) before even accounting for the switch and the wifi, and the person who&#039;ll be using the system doesn&#039;t need any additional applications, I think it&#039;s overkill. But I&#039;ll certainly consider it for my own next network :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>If you are considering the device, here is a chance for you to kill two birds with a single stone. Give your current NAT/Firewall router to the family and spend the money to build a new 3/G/4G WiFi router using the device + a gIGE switch, instead.</p>									</div>

					<p>My first choice would be the Netgear WNDR3700.&nbsp; It&#039;s a great N router that works well with OpenWrt, but may be more than you need for your setup.&nbsp; The best value is the TP-Link TL-WR1043ND.&nbsp; It also works well with OpenWrt, but costs considerably less.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>LinkZ</strong> on 9 Dec 2010, 21:25)</p>

					<p>In case someone comes across this post and wonders about my conclusions: I ended up with the WNDR3700. It&#039;s now running 10.03.1-rc4 and seems to be working great. It&#039;s only been stress-tested for 12 hours, but both radios seem to be working perfectly.</p><p>Thanks a bunch to all the people behind OpenWRT - you&#039;ve really done a great job! Thanks also to the people suggesting hardware in this thread.</p>									</div>
