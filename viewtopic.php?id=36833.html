					<p>Hi gcbwrt,</p><p>Not a good idea!<br />Ponder it for a second. To run the fan you will pull even more current causing the router power supply to run even hotter.<br />If it draws to much current it could blow something inside.<br />Also connecting the fan to the 3.3 volt rail may cause impulse noise issues on the router chips, etc.</p><p>Use an external power supply (5 volt or 12 volt depending on the fan requirements).</p><p>~john</p>									</div>

					<p>thanks!<br />i was [wildly] guessing that the extra current draw would only impact the power supply components, not affecting the heat on the processing parts </p><p>and i confess i know nothing about impulse noise so i will assume it will happen.</p><br /><p>would it be less dumb if i tap directly on the power supply connectors? i have others power bricks that can supply over 1/2A of what the modem pulls currently, with the same voltage.&nbsp; ..even thought then i would have to mod a 12cm 12v fan i have around in the 10cm case <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gcbwrt</strong> on 14 May 2012, 22:02)</p>

					<p>Hi gcbwrt<br />If your wall power plug type power supply can push enough current then you may get by by using the (assuming +5 Volts) inside the router.</p><p>But I suspect you have an equal amount of work which ever route you go.</p><p>Why risk your router any further?....I&#039;d go with the external power supply and mod as required.</p><p>Best of luck.</p><p>~john</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, i ditched the fan idea so far, but still need help.</p><p>the modem still hangs after some time once a day. always near some random full hour...&nbsp; i still think this is some hint. usually from 4pm to 9pm. but i couldn&#039;t get a real pattern other then always being between +/-10min from a full hour.</p><p>I attached the heatsinks a couple weeks ago. they still get hot, but do not burn my finger almost instantly as before. seems to have helped.</p><p>shame shot:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mB2tvt79Jqc/T77W2CG0OoI/AAAAAAAAAhw/53If5j41u58/s800/IMG_20120524_174739.jpg" alt="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mB2tvt79Jqc/T77W2CG0OoI/AAAAAAAAAhw/53If5j41u58/s800/IMG_20120524_174739.jpg" /></span></p><p>I thought i could use openwrt on this... but i don&#039;t think the cpu supports it. chip says &quot;conexant gs8120-174-008d b0&quot;</p><p>I do have an actiontec GT710D but i&#039;m <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=37052">not having luck getting it to run with openWRT as a dsl modem</a>... so i have to soldier on with this one a little longer.</p><p>any idea how i can try to debug what&#039;s happening?<br />i can access it&#039;s viking thingy via telnet.</p><p>it seems to have serial support, judging from the 6 1mm pins in line, but connecting a serial line converter to it makes the modem hang on startup (since i do not know which one is PIN0, i tried both ways, both they hang with one or another LED on and no activity) they may be mixed for all that i could find ( nothing <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> but i will not try all the combinations as the 2 i tried was already risk not knowing what that port is about. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>So, i&#039;m guessing my best bet is the viking shell. </p><p>i&#039;ve found a bunch of pages describing it, but all of them talks about shells much, much, much more capable than what i have. mine is missing most of the commands those pages mention.</p><p>help give me this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>$help

					<p>My DLink DSL-300T (looks like a similar motherboard) worked fine for a year or so, and then started rebooting itself daily. It then became a more consistent problem. Unfortunately, the quick and easy solution was to get one of those little dumb (no intelligence) SpeedStream modems used for $2, and take care of the PPPoE authentication on my router instead.</p><p>With regards to OpenWRT on that CPU, <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=106709">this thread</a> discusses it.<br /><a href="http://www.brendangillatt.co.uk/pages/talktalk-modem/">This page</a> discusses what appears to be a rebranded DSL-500g. It goes over pinouts and such.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Shadyman</strong> on 18 Jun 2012, 10:16)</p>
