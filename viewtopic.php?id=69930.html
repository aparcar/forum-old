					<p>Quick question, I guess something has changed because I no longer can mount my external flash/HDD.</p><p>In mounting point section I selected my /dev/sda1 as my drive and I mounted it to /external</p><p>Back in a day it didn&#039;t work automatically, like I wouldn&#039;t see my external storage drive in external folder like I wanted to, I had to mount it automatically once doing something like</p><p>mount /dev/sda1 /external</p><p>and then I would of see it in df -h as nice external storage mounted in to my /external folder. But no so anymore. Did syntax changed or something ? Can anyone please help. My current drive is mounted in GUI in to /dev/sda1 and mount point is /external (I mean it can be /tmp/external or something like that I don&#039;t care where is folder is at.</p><p>But for now here is what I have</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@WRT1900ACv2:~# df -h

					<p>Yeah all packages seems to be there. And thgen for a second I thought I you got when telling me to mount /dev/sda1 to /mnt/external instead of just /external but ... it didn&#039;t work.</p><p>Quick question , is there a way to see in SSH if OpenWRT see &quot;device&quot; like actual hardware in SSH ? Because what is there IS no /dev/sda1 to begin with. Cause in luci I see drive and stuff but just like mounting means nothing in Luci may be drive is also not even there to begin with.</p>									</div>
