					<p>Hello Matt! <br />I guess You should try asking about that on dd-wrt forum. <br />But if You already asked - what is the message/output after You try to upgrade ? I don&#039;t use dd-wrt so I can only help with openwrt part of the job. <br />Also - make sure that You have boot_wait option marked as on. This will help You in case something goes wrong....</p><p>Michal</p>									</div>
