					<p>I just read through this post again and thought I could clarify things for those that are having trouble.</p><br /><p>There are two wireless client modes, sta (station) and wet (wireless ethernet). They will both have OpenWrt connect to an AP. Neither of these modes will allow the unit to have wireless clients connect to it. It is no longer an access point.</p><p>wl0_mode=sta </p><p>In this mode, the wireless interface is going to be the WAN port. This implies that the ethernet ports will all be on the lan. The wireless interface is nothing more than a client connection that gives us access to an external network (internet usually). The bridge must be separated since the traffic on our wireless WAN port is not to be linked directly with the local network.</p><p>wl0_mode=wet<br />In this mode, the wireless interface will still connect as a client to another AP. The difference is that the bridge is still intact, and the clients (connected via an ethernet port) will have direct access to the network behind the AP.</p><p>I hope this description will help people better understand the differences between these modes so they can get it set up properly.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>joebush</strong> on 17 Apr 2006, 14:41)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m planning to set my WRT54Gv2 to bridged client mode as described in <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/ClientModeHowto">http://wiki.openwrt.org/ClientModeHowto</a>.</p><p>Once I&#039;ve entered bridged client mode, committed the changes, and rebooted, how do I get back into my WRT54G? Once this mode is entered, does &quot;lan_ipaddr=x.x.x.x&quot; sit on the bridged network as a sort of management IP?</p><p>If not, is there a way to give the WRT54G as bridged client an IP address for management? What about making use of the unused WAN port as a management port? </p><p>Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>
