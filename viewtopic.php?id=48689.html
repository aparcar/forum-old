					<p>Hello,</p><p>Due to the recent discussion in Germany in regards to SMART TV and &#039;big-brother is watching&#039; you, I would like to get rid of my AVM Fritz!Box router and the simple FW feature and use a OpenWRT router instead.</p><p>My idea is to disable the WLAN feature on the AVM box completely and to implement a OpenWRT router in between the home network and the AVM box. The OpenWRT is configured as an access point for all WLAN clients at home and connected by GigBitEth-WAN port with the AVM box. Additionally, I would like to enable the more powerful and flexible firewall feature with a ruleset on the OpenWRT and log all traffic (maybe on a external storage).</p><p>I&#039;m wondering, if a OpenWRT router incl. the additional firewall feature is powerful enough to handle the logging task or if I have to use another platform, e.g. SoC Arm dualcore based architecture (Cubietruck)?</p><p>My preferred router is a TP-Link TL-WR1043ND (v2). Because I have already a lot of experience with an older version of that router inc. OpenWRT.&nbsp; I have also a Raspberry already successfully running at home for some basic home automation.</p><p>When I&#039;m honest, I don&#039;t like the idea of Cubietruck as a wlan ap router, because of the missing ethernet ports and the missing external antenna.</p>									</div>
