					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a serious problem with one of my routers. I performed a firmware upgrade with seems to be a wrong file. It was with official linksys firmware, for WRT55AG V2 (Atheros 5312 / VxWorks platform), matching my router. I&#039;m almost certain that inspite of the name, it was&#039;nt for WRT55AG V2. It can&#039;t boot now. <br />This post is an SOS, as I did many tests so far. I am also willing to exchange the software for something useful and help the community. I don&#039;t need the original firmware restored, an opensource fimrware would be nicer. The priority though is de-bricking the device.</p><p>I started by soldering a serial port and got this:</p><p>Atheros AR5001AP default version 4.0.0.140<br />Bootloader version 1.03</p><p>auto-booting...</p><p>Attaching to TFFS... done.<br />Loading /fl/APIMG1...1470912<br />Starting at 0x804846e0...</p><p>Address load Exception<br />Exception Program Counter: 0x0ee778c7<br />Status Register: 0x00000000<br />Cause Register: 0x10808010<br />Access Address : 0x0ee778c7<br />Task: 0x80f9f900 &quot;tBoot&quot;</p><br /><p>And boot process starts all over again, every 2 seconds.<br />I hit ESC to interact with the VxWorks bootloader and could point the boot device to Ethernert port(ae0) instead of Flash (TFFS). Sending via tftp hasn&#039;t worked at all. It was suposed to, there is even a flag to do so, which I don&#039;t see any effect when activated. The only thinh I see when pointing the device to boot from &quot;ae0&quot; is my firewall warning of port 514 TCP being accessed. Ok, this is RSH, so I installed an RSHd daemon /server and I put the original (good) firmware file on same directory.</p><p>I see comand &quot;cat &lt;firmware_file&gt;&quot; being executed. I had to install cygwin to have command &quot;cat&quot; on my windows PC and finally on the serial console connected to the bricked WRT55AG I see:</p><p>auto-booting...</p><p>Attached TCP/IP interface to ae0.<br />Attaching network interface lo0... done.<br />Loading... Erroneous header read</p><p>Error loading file: errno = 0x610001. </p><p>This error is documented here:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Netgear/WGT624">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har â€¦ ear/WGT624</a></p><p>I executed the command that is advised in that page<br />$ dd if=510APB_1121ETSI.img of=tftp.img skip=116 bs=1</p><p>I had to change 52 to 116 since my firmware file has 116 bytes until the &quot;.ELF&quot; ascii header in the firmware.<br />Then the comand &quot;file &lt;firmware_file&gt; outputs: ELF 32-bit MSB executable, MIPS, MIPS-II version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, stripped</p><p>I thought I had my good fimrware file all set to send by RSH to the WRT55AG, so I booted once again and got this:</p><br /><p>Atheros AR5001AP default version 4.0.0.140<br />Bootloader version 1.03</p><p>auto-booting...</p><p>Attached TCP/IP interface to ae0.<br />Attaching network interface lo0... done.<br />Loading... Size is incorrect</p><p>Error loading file: errno = 0x610001.<br />Can&#039;t load boot file!!</p><br /><p>And that&#039;s where I am now. I am willing to try another firmware, but my problem is that:</p><p>1 - I don&#039;t know how to change this bootloader to &quot;Redboot&quot;<br />2 - I dont&#039; know if the JTAG works ok with this router. I did&#039;t find any info about anyone sucessfuly unbricking /changing firmware on the WRT55AG (v2) via JTAG.</p><p>So, if you know what&#039;s wrong with my current file via RSH, can point me in the right direction to install Redboot or can help me with the JTAG solution (to any firmware) I would appreciate very much that you post a reply to this topic.</p><p>Many thanks</p><p>Pathlost</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pathlost</strong> on 16 Dec 2008, 03:05)</p>

					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;m happy to report that I successfully unbricked my WRT55AG v2. The solution was to read a complete flash dump from a working device and flash it again on the bricked unit.</p><p>To those interested in this Atheros Dual-Band platform, I published the dumps on this page:<br /><a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=43685">http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=43685</a></p><p>You need to be registered to download the files.</p><p>Best wishes to 2009</p><p>Regards,<br />Pathlost</p>									</div>
