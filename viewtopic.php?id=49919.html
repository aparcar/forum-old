					<p>Hi<br />I have a carambola2 running openwrt and would like to add 5 GHz wi-fi support by adding a USB dongle. So , my question is what is a suitable USB dongle that is dual band? </p><p>I was looking at the Cisco Linksys AE2500, but I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s the best choice. I&#039;m looking for something that already has driver support (that works with the space restrictions of the carambola2) and is reasonably cheap, but still has a good TX power. The environment where the router is operating has the potential for a lot of 2.4 GHz interference and therefore it would be good to have the ability to switch between exclusively 5 GHz or 2.4 GHz (or have the router do this automatically depending on the SNR).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Top-Dog</strong> on 6 Apr 2014, 03:05)</p>

					<p>Can somebody please explain how to get this device working? I&#039;m really not sure of the steps involved... cross compile a driver and move it across to the Carambola2 router? A bit of advice would be great.</p><p>I&#039;m basically trying to get a dual band router by using the 5 GHz from the USB device, like here: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=48248">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=48248</a></p>									</div>
