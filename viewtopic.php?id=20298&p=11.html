					<p>Guys, I gave up. Flashing WRT160NL is very geeky and enjoyable, but the performance of ath9k is poor. I had MANY difficulties connecting to ath9k AP, some with no problems (WinXP laptop Intel wifi at 802.11n), some totally not working (my main purpose buying 2x WRT160NL and running 1 as AP, 1 as wifi client-bridge), some partially (Edimax broadcom? with some errors at 802.11g, 802.11n could not ping).</p><p>I had problems with:<br />autorization - at 802.11n were clients unable to finish WPA2 handshake (OpenWrt log - hostpad: deauthenticated by local deauth request)<br />DMA errors - network in load cripples the driver 54M -&gt; 1M (ath9k: DMA failed to stop in 10 ms)<br />nonfunctional bridge - tried every possible config with no success, sometimes it got at least IP from DHCP, the best cases even could ping the gateway</p><p>Ath9k simply needs a bit time to mature, OpenWrt is fine as it is.</p>									</div>

					<p>Dear All:</p><p>I am on revision 17668 and am having quite a bit of troubles:<br />1. Most (60%) of the time when I turn on the wrt160nl the light above the middle button never stops flashing and the router is inaccessible.<br />2. udhcpc only gets an IP the first time. If I do ifdown wan &amp;&amp; ifup wan no IP is gotten for my Internet connection.<br />3. PPPOE does not work _at all_</p><p>Is there a good trunk revision for this router? I&#039;m not even talking about Wireless...</p><p>Thank you<br />Misha</p><p>p.s. Also I seem to lose approximately 10 fold speed going from my DSL 2Wire 2701HG-B modem to the<br />WL160NL (this is direct test, either laptop connected to 2701HG-B or going through ssh SOCKS proxy to router). It might be the DMZplus feature not sure... can&#039;t do PPPOE so can&#039;t test. Will try to make serial console with Ethernet this weekend. Any tips for a working trunk would be much appreciated.</p><p>p.p.s. If anyone has a working pivotroot and rcS for USB flash drive booting for this router, also much appreciated. Thank you.

					<p>Hi together,</p><p>I just got my brand new WRT160NL and installed OpenWrt on it. Everything ran very smooth. :-) </p><p>I have not gone through long-term tests, but what I see looks promising. LAN works fine, WLAN also. I had no problem connecting and transfering data at high speed. I can&#039;t test Draft-N because my Draft-N Client ist missing at the moment.</p><p>I want to create multiple virtual wlan interfaces with different ssid. I checked in &quot;make menuconfig&quot; the option &quot;kmod-max80211-hwsim&quot; in Kernel modules-&gt;Wireless Drivers. The first look back in OpenWrt was promising again. The kernel module generated wlan0, wlan1 and wlan2. But I&#039;m only able to user wlan0. <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# wifi up

I can connect using my Samsung NC10 and transfer data. But I can&#039;t even see wlan1 and wlan2.</p><p>From iwconfig<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>wlan0     IEEE 802.11bgn  Mode:Master  Frequency:2.432 GHz  Tx-Power=1 dBm

          Power Management:off</code></pre></div><p>As you can see wlan1 and wlan2 are configured as abgn - could this be the real failure? Additionally, the Mac-Adress is strange but that shouldn&#039;t be the problem.</p><p>Did anybody of you already had success configuring multiple APs with ath9k?</p><p>Btw: Does anybody know when it will be possible to use port based vlan with the integrated switch? I can&#039;t find any progress on this. :-/ Its not absolutely needed, but it would be very nice to have this feature.</p><p>thanks in advance</p>									</div>
