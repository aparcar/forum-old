					<p>I am experimenting with openwrt, and tried it on an old Linksys router. Everything appeared to have loaded appropriately, it even finished with the linksys screen saying that the update was successful.&nbsp; However, the root page is inaccessible. I can ping it from the command line, and ip config confirms gateway to be 192.168.1.1. But it will not load on any of my browser&#039;s. I did also confirm&nbsp; that I loaded the right firmware , in the right version.&nbsp; What am I doing wrong?</p>									</div>
