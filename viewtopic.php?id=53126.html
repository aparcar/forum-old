					<p>Hi, I&#039;m new to OpenWRT and to hacking my router, so thanks in advance for any help!</p><p>I have a <strong>TP-Link TL-MR3420 v1</strong>. I want to install OpenWrt on it.<br />I&#039;ve been reading everything I can find on the wiki, particularly <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-mr3420">the page for this family of routers</a>, but that page seems outdated and has left me with a few questions.</p><p>The wiki page has a compatibility table which lists Backfire as the latest version for this device, but with a warning saying &quot;The failsafe function is not working at launch time, serial is also unfriendly: Stick to trunk.&quot;<br />Further down the page is a downloads table, offering me a download of AA Final (r36088) in addition to Backfire and trunk (r40698).</p><p>Clearly I don&#039;t want to use Backfire if it is broken, but I would also like to avoid trunk if I can (particularly since it comes without a web interface). <strong>Will AA work?</strong><br />(I note that the compatibility table does list AA for a different model of router but with a notice saying there are major bugs.)</p><p>Also, what about BB, is that not available for this router?</p>									</div>
