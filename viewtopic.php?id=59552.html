					<p>Trying out the Chaos Calmer final release, I found that nodogsplash cannot be installed because it depends on a specific kernel version.&nbsp; This was not a problem with rc3.&nbsp; I hope someone has it on their to-do list to update this dependency.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>My apologies to you!&nbsp; The problem wasn&#039;t with nodogsplash after all.&nbsp; It was with the list of repositories, which somehow didn&#039;t get updated when I did a distribution upgrade from OpenWrt 15.05-rc3 to 15.05.&nbsp; Thank you for responding, though.</p>									</div>
