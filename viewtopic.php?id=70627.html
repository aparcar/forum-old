					<p>I purchased the 3200 but the wifi is basically useless, which makes the router useless.&nbsp; I just want a router where the wired and wireless works and will be stable, all functions of the router will work and I can configure my PIA VPN in it.&nbsp; Seems like everytime I get a recommendation for a good router I look into it further and something isn&#039;t working right once you flash the open source firmware.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
