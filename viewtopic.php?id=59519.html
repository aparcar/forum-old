					<p>I installed this version of OpenWRT with little to no issues. <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-wndr3800ch-squashfs-factory.img">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … actory.img</a><br />However, as much as i love OpenWRT, apparently I&#039;m just leasing the router from my Cable Company (woops <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/yikes.png" width="15" height="15" alt="yikes" />). I need to get my original firmware back! <a href="https://www.charter.com/uploads/router-update/WNDR3800-V2.1.0.59CH.img">https://www.charter.com/uploads/router- … 0.59CH.img</a><br />I tried the Web Interface firmware upgrader, and it spit out an error. After doing some research, I attempted an TFTP upgrade. I kept getting an error when trying the default firmware, but could flash OpenWRT with no issues. I tried to edit the Hex but I believe that it goes over my head. Any help is appreciated!<br />Here&#039;s the Hex if you want it!<br />OPENWRT<br />00000000h: 64 65 76 69 63 65 3A 57 4E 44 52 33 38 30 30 43 ; device:WNDR3800C<br />00000010h: 48 0A 76 65 72 73 69 6F 6E 3A 56 4F 70 65 6E 57 ; H.version:VOpenW<br />00000020h: 72 74 2E 72 34 36 38 31 35 0A 72 65 67 69 6F 6E ; rt.r46815.region<br />00000030h: 3A 0A 68 64 5F 69 64 3A 32 39 37 36 33 36 35 34 ; :.hd_id:29763654<br />00000040h: 2B 31 36 2B 31 32 38 0A 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ; +16+128.........<br />00000050h: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ; ................<br />00000060h: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ; ................<br />00000070h: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ; ................<br />Default Firmware<br />00000000h: 64 65 76 69 63 65 3A 57 4E 44 52 33 38 30 30 0A ; device:WNDR3800.<br />00000010h: 76 65 72 73 69 6F 6E 3A 56 32 2E 31 2E 30 2E 35 ; version:V2.1.0.5<br />00000020h: 39 43 48 0A 72 65 67 69 6F 6E 3A 0A 68 64 5F 69 ; 9CH.region:.hd_i<br />00000030h: 64 3A 32 39 37 36 33 36 35 34 2B 31 36 2B 31 32 ; d:29763654+16+12<br />00000040h: 38 0A 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ; 8...............<br />00000050h: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ; ................<br />00000060h: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ; ................<br />00000070h: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ; ................<br />(I&#039;m looking for a direct .img that will work, or even the corrected Hex!

					<p>Ah , just noticed it&#039;s a 3800 and not a 4300.&nbsp; There shouldn&#039;t be any practical difference in the flashing procedure between these two models.&nbsp; Can we assume you&#039;ve read the wiki (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3800#recovery_flash_in_failsafe_mode">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wnd … lsafe_mode</a>) about failsafe mode and recovery?&nbsp; Basically, the SureWest routers are locked to only accept firmware marked for them, so they won&#039;t take the stock Netgear FW.&nbsp; Try to figure out if you have a stock Netgear 3800 or if you&#039;ve got one locked to your ISP firmware.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fecaleagle</strong> on 11 Sep 2015, 02:26)</p>

					<p>[SOLVED]<br />Thanks for your quick reply, i had the locked Charter ISP version.<br />I tried everything with TFTP, but it didn&#039;t work. I had to strip the first 32 bytes with UltraEdit and then change to a .trx file. Then, i used the OpenWRT flash utility in LUCI to upgrade!<br />Now everything is fine. I will probuably use my second router in order to expand my network with OpenWRT, because it truly is a excellent firmware. Thank You!</p>									</div>

					<p>[SOLVED]<br />I was having the same issue as the OP today and happened onto this post.</p><p>Was able to get the stock firmware loaded&nbsp; <a href="https://www.charter.com/uploads/router-update/WNDR3800-V2.1.0.59CH.img">https://www.charter.com/uploads/router- … 0.59CH.img</a></p><p>But in my case what worked was to remove the first 128 bytes from the above file and then rename it to a &quot;.bin&quot; file.&nbsp; The resulting file was accepted by the OpenWRTs firmware upgrade webpage and flashed as expected.&nbsp; I used Notepad++ and the hexeditor pluging to do this but other editors will work as well.</p><p>This procedure I think is needed only for Charter locked WNDR3800.&nbsp; The model number on the bottom says WNDR3800 but the charter firmware says WNDR3800CH on their web interface.&nbsp; Thanks a lot Charter for making things complicated for no reason.</p><p>Great to have this thread and other to consult with :-)</p>									</div>
