					<p>Even though setup is simple and straight forward, I&#039;m having troubles getting IPv6 PD to work over PPPoE Link. PPPoE server is Mikrotik, client is Chaos Calmer and it is configured according to this <a href="http://ipv6.br/media/arquivo/ipv6/file/16/11-NicBR-Eduardo.pdf">http://ipv6.br/media/arquivo/ipv6/file/ â€¦ duardo.pdf</a><br />When I use another Mikrotik as client prefix delegation with same server setup works just fine, but on OpenWrt <br />I don&#039;t get prefix, nowhere in logread I see IA_PD, only IA_NA. Not sure if this is important but it looks interesting<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> daemon.info dnsmasq[2560]: compile time options: IPv6 GNU-getopt no-DBus no-i18n no-IDN DHCP no-DHCPv6 no-Lua TFTP no-conntrack no-ipset no-auth no-DNSSEC loop-detect inotify</code></pre></div><p>Just to mention, I downloaded generic OpenWrt for TP-Link wr740, without any customizations on my side.</p><p>When I use dhcpv6 client connected to another OpenWrt (without pppoe, just static IP) prefix delegation works.

					<p>I had some problems with 15.05 and ipv6 also (haven&#039;t tested if it was fixed in 15.05.01 or later r, atm I prefer to run 14.07 r48549 that I compiled (nothing changed, I just wanted the latest 14.07), at some point in the future I will compile a 15.05 rXXXXX, I just wait to see less patches for 15.05 <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" />).<br />I wasn&#039;t getting any ipv6 over pppoe I was getting only ipv4.

With &#039;eth1&#039; I wasn&#039;t even getting ipv6 (log showed that it wasn&#039;t even trying to get it), with &#039;@wan&#039; everything started to work right (router was getting ipv6 and clients were getting internet ipv6 and <a href="http://test-ipv6.com/">http://test-ipv6.com/</a> was showing that ipv6 is working properly on clients).<br />Your situation might not be the same, but you can try to change &#039;eth1&#039; to &#039;@wan&#039; just to test if something is changed.</p><p>Something from: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network6">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network6</a></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface wan6

					<p>Glad that you fixed the problem. I wanted to write about this on the forum when I had it and how I fixed it but at that point (nov/dec 2015) I had issues registering on the forum (I wasn&#039;t getting the confirmation email <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> ).</p><p>No clue why it stay/is &#039;eth1&#039; .</p><p>Regarding the PPPoE bug in the first 15.05 release if u want to trigger it you stop and connect wan interface a couple of times. At some point you will trigger the bug, it my case I was triggering it really fast (usualy at the first reconnect attempt). If I was getting disconnected (due to a power cut between me and the isp, it happens sometimes) I was triggering that pppoe bug when router was trying to reconnect so 15.05 was a no go for me (my father is playing online games during the night and he has no clue how to access the router to see if there is a problem or not, so I kinda needed something that just works, else my father will just complain in the morning when I wake up <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /> ) (at that point I wasn&#039;t compiling OpenWRT from git) . This is why I said about updating to 15.05.1 <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> .</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>thedukesd</strong> on 26 Mar 2016, 15:59)</p>
