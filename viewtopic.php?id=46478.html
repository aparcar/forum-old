					<p>Hey<br />I recently switched from dd-wrt to openwrt. I try to get all my old scripts running but the one that wakes up my server when an active client is in the lan failed.<br />On dd-wrt i used /proc/net/arp to detect the active clients. This doesnt work anymore because the entries stays too long in it.<br />I also looked at the /tmp/dhcp.leases but the lease time is counting down even if a client is active.</p><p>So here is my question:</p><p>Where can I get a list of active clients in my lan from?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Lemy</strong> on 6 Oct 2013, 17:52)</p>

					<p>what you could do is shorten the leasetime (minimum is 2minutes) but ofcourse it is counting down, because the ip is leased for a set amount of time <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

					<p>If the leasetime has run out, the client will do a new dhcp request and suggests the ip it allready has.<br />The dhcp server then can decline the suggestion and assign a new ip.</p><p>but the lease time will be reset again. (also the clients will get most likely the same ip, since there isn&#039;t a need for a different ip). This even goes for static leases.</p>									</div>
