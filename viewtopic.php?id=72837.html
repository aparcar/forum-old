					<p>I flashed my Netgear EX2700 extender as per the wiki:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/netgear_ex2700">wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/netgear_ex2700</a></p><p>First I changed the Netgear firmware to v1.0.1.8 and then <br />I flashed OpenWrt 15.05 through the stock interface, as suggested in the wiki.</p><p>I tried using telnet:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Microsoft Telnet&gt; open 192.168.1.1 23
Connecting To 192.168.1.1...Could not open connection to the host, on port 23: Connect failed
Microsoft Telnet&gt;</code></pre></div><p>My IPs are:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>   IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.206

   Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.1</code></pre></div><p>I even tried ssh but from what I understand I cannot ssh into the repeater until I set a password using telnet.</p><p>I&#039;m a newbie in this area and I&#039;m really hoping I didn&#039;t brick it...<br />Any input is greatly appreciated.
