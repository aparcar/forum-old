					<p>Please assume I am ignorant...</p><p>When I try to cross-compile aircrack-ng 1.2 rc4&nbsp; for my router (GL-AR300M) I get the following errors:</p><p>ld: cannot find -lssl<br />ld: cannot find -lcrypto<br />ld: cannot find -lssp-nonshared<br />ld: cannot find -lssp</p><p>I have been told that I need the MIPS flavor of OpenSSL in order for the linker to work.</p><p>Where would I find this?</p><p>Assuming it is not available is there a particular branch/variant/vintage I need to cross-compile to be able to link?</p><p>In either case where should the appropriate objects be placed in the toolchain or build_dir or wherever?</p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenSSL is already part of OpenWrt, you just need to select it and have the build system compile it for the target system.&nbsp; Editing the aircrack Makefile to make OpenSSL a dependency would make that automatic.</p>									</div>
