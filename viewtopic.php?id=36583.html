					<p>Hey community.</p><p>I try to set up an vpn connection to my server since two weeks without success. I really don&#039;t know what else I can try. Anyway, I hope to find again some help here <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />. </p><p>Fist of all a few infos:</p><p>The goal is to direct all my internet traffic over my server. I already created the ca.crt, dh1024.pem, openwrt.crt and openwrt.key files there.</p><p>On the router I installed luci-app-openvpn. First I tried to use the sample_client. I added both .crt, the .pem and the keyfile there. I also did the /etc/openvpn/userpass.txt thing with following contend:<br /><strong><br />openwrt<br />my_password<br /></strong></p><p>But all without success -&nbsp; The sample_client won&#039;t start. </p><p>I have the following configuration in Services/Openvpn/sample_client:</p><p><span class="bbu">Service tab:</span> All default<br /><span class="bbu">Networking tab:</span> All default<br /><span class="bbu">VPN tab: </span><br /><strong>Clien</strong>t X<br /><strong>Pull</strong><br /><strong>auth_user_pass</strong> /etc/openvpn/userpass.txt<br /><strong>remote</strong> my.server.ip.without.port<br /><strong>remote</strong>_random x<br /><strong>proto</strong> udp<br /><strong>http_proxy_retry</strong><br /><strong>resolv_retry</strong> infinite<br /><span class="bbu">Cryptography tab:</span> All default exept<br /><strong>tls_client</strong> x<br /><strong>ca</strong> (uploaded file)<br /><strong>dh</strong> (uploaded file)<br /><strong>cert</strong> (uploaded file)<br /><strong>key</strong> (uploaded file)</p><br /><p>Well well, I do not know what to do next... I also tried .crt files without password or many other configurations including own vpn interfaces and so on... All in all, I&#039;m just confused jet. </p><p>Please excuse bad spelling. I don&#039;t use my English that often (which is maybe the main problem <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />)</p><p>I hope you people can help me. </p><p>Best regards and thanks in advance</p><p>Steward</p><br /><p>Edit: Sorry, I forgot to say that I&#039;m using OpenWrt Backfire 10.03.1 / LuCI 0.10.0 Release (0.10.0) on an TP-LINK TL-WR1043ND.</p><p>One more edit: Am I able to use just my OpenVPN account without all this certificate stuff (like on my computer)?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>steward</strong> on 2 May 2012, 16:26)</p>
