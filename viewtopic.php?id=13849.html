					<p>Sorry for not having better detail.</p><p>I haven&#039;t started setting this up, so I don&#039;t have configs.</p><p>I&#039;m pretty sure this can be done.&nbsp; My first question is &quot;Should I do this using routing tables, or using the firewall tables, or both?&quot;</p><p>I think I&#039;m going to have one end (call it the server) at a fixed IP address.&nbsp; The client IP address can change.</p><p>On the client, I could have a routing table kinda like:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Kernel IP routing table
