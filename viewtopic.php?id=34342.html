					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have one questions that I will be very glade to listen advises. And because I never done this... will be very appreciated.</p><p>1- It is possible to do LACP (802.3ad Link Aggregation Control Protocol - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_aggregation)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_aggregation)</a>, in OpenWRT? </p><p>You may think why? And the answer is: For the network load to be balanced across more links, and because of bandwidth limitations.<br />I will need to combine two physical Ethernet links or ports, into one logical link via channel bonding. Of course this solution required manual configuration and identical equipment on both sides of the aggregation, and I mentioned identical I mean that both support 802.3ad.</p><p>Regards,<br />Craig Davids</p>									</div>

					<p>It would be possible if you have two or more separate phy interface (t.e. NICs, eth0, eth1, etc). For example, if you are running OpenWrt on a x86 machine with several NICs - in this case, it would be the same as on any other linux distro - using ifenslave, miitools, etc.</p><p>In the case when you have a wireless router, you typically have only one phy interface - eth0, which is the interface which is used by the kernel and the cpu to address a multiport manageable switch. If the device has a dedicated switch controller, like TP-Link 1043ND (RTL8366rb) eth0 will address the kernel interpretation of your switch controller. In both cases, eth0 typically is combining all phy ethernet ports. The only thing I find applicable is, if we have a patch to the switch controller&#039;s driver (ex. RTL8366rb) that makes possible to configure the switch registres and set them in a mode to combine phy ports in link aggregation virtual ports&nbsp; - like port-channel (etherchannels in Cisco). However, in order to do that, the switch controller should have such capabilities.</p><p>I was also interesed in that before (and I am still interested), but since there is no driver support for this feature, I do not think it would be possible if we have just one phy interface. </p><p>Maybe somebody else will share some experience too.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi again,</p><p>I have not tried this, but would be quite interested to see what the results are. Bonding on its own, I would think would have originated with ethernet.

					<p>Hello,</p><p>A little guide:<br />So it is important to install 4 packages: ifenslave, mii-tools, kmod-bonding and kmod-ipv6. The Channel Bonding Driver is v3.5.0. <br />After this do:<br />#insmod /lib/modules/2.6.32.25/bonding.ko mode=0 miimon=100 - is important to define &#039;mode&#039; and &#039;miimon&#039; or this message appears:<br />&quot;bonding: Warning: either miimon or arp_interval and arp_ip_target module parameters must be specified, otherwise bonding will not detect link failures! see bonding.txt for details.&quot;</p><p>#ifconfig bond0 x.x.x.x netmask y.y.y.y up - the IP maybe also 0.0.0.0 if working with VLAN&#039;s...<br />#ifenslave bond0 eth0 <br />#ifenslave bond0 eth1</p><p>O course having ipv6 enabled if you are not utilizing may leads to over head in DNS lookups and additional load place on your dns severs, since looks up will go &#039;AAAA&#039; records (ipv6) first than &#039;A&#039; records (ipv4). And if you have a domain search list this will add additional latency as well. This is particular important for low latency applications.

					<p>Hi,</p><p>yes, ipv6 support have to be built into the image. If you do not have ipv6 support built in, you do not need to load that module, this 3 modules ifenslave, mii-tools, kmod-bonding are enough.<br />If you had an IPv6 enabled kernel with IPv6 support enabled by default you load kmod-ipv6. Now, we have an IPv6 enabled kernel, but the interfaces are IPv6 disabled by default. </p><p>Regardless of whether IPv6 is by default enabled or disabled, we can enable or disable IPv6 interfaces at runtime by modifying the «disable_ipv6» parameter as follows:<br /># echo 0 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/interface/disable_ipv6</p><p>Hope this helps,<br />Regards,<br />Craig Davids</p>									</div>
