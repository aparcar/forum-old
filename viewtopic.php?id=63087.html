					<p>Hello,</p><p>Please help me debrick a Trendnet TEW-632BRP router (which now runs official firmware, but I would like to install OpenWRT on it).</p><p>Exact hardware is Trendnet TEW-632BRP ver. A1.1R, last running 1.00b0042 or later.</p><p>Now I am unable to access the router (not mine, but no obvious or suspected hardware damage...), even after pressing the RESET button.</p><p>After powering on the unit, all LEDs light up continuously, except WLAN. There is no Ethernet connectivity.</p><p>Pressing RESET button for 15 s changes nothing.</p><p>By disconnecting power, pressing RESET, reapplying power, holding the RESET button for more than 30 s, then releasing, the router enters (probably) in failsafe mode: STATUS LED blinks, WLAN is off, all other LEDs are on. From my laptop, I still cannot establish Ethernet connectivity on any router&#039;s documented IP address (192.168.10.1, 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1)</p><p>Please provide a way to restore default settings &amp; connectivity.</p><p>Best regards,<br />RÄƒzvan</p>									</div>
