					<p>A new version of freifunk firmware is available for download. While I&#039;m quite happy with the firmware, I have attached a version number of 1.0 now.</p><p>Brief description.: FF-Firmware is an openwrt/stable with a few optimizations and some preinstalled packages for use with OLSR-based community networks not using encryption for wireless communication. Details may be found on the project homepage also, refer to <a href="http://ff-firmware.sourceforge.net">http://ff-firmware.sourceforge.net</a>/ After installation through the original web UI just enter IP and go. It is possible to install additional packets from any openwrt/stable repository.</p><p>The firmware itself behaves stable, but as usual some minor bugfixes will come due to this public release and the expected feedback. I have tested the FFF on the following devices: WRT54G-V2.0, WRT54G-V2.2, WRT54GS-V2.0, WAP54G-V2.0(4Mb Flash), WAP54G-V2.0(2 Mb Flash), AllNet 0277. I have positive feedback for WRT54G-V1.1 and WRT54GS-V1.1 also.</p><p>Since the last version 0.6.8 there are several improvements made:</p><p>* LZMA compression save flash space<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;(TRX is 1.4 Mb which is smaller than the original openwrt/stable)</p><p>* MTD update to speed up jffs2 and make WAP54G(2Mb) running</p><p>* Update to olsrd-0.4.10-pre</p><p>* Changed dyngw (added policy routing with iproute2 for this)</p><p>* Added software-install, client/master/ad-hoc/bridge-mode,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;extended status and firmware download from squashfs to web UI</p><p>* Added Mcast Route to kernel, disabled BBC, speedup dropbear, <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;added softdog (watchdog for stability), olsrd-nameservice, <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;olsrd-httpinfo, TFTP client for flashing neighbor devices</p><p>* Lots of bugfixes</p><p>Because several people have asked for an LZMA and G-2.2/GS-1.1 compatible openwrt/stable, I also added a &quot;minimal&quot; release without freifunk Adonis (TRX is 1132KB, so there are 2624KB free on Jffs2). The missing parts originally included with openwrt/stable are installable with the &quot;freifunk-removed-from-openwrt_1.0_mipsel.ipk&quot; package if you really need them.</p><p>There is also a &quot;kit&quot; for all variants available. The kit will made customizations easy (the counterpart of the openwrt/experimental &quot;ImageBuilder&quot;).</p><p>Notes for updaters: For standard cases, there is an NVRAM-compatibility script which converts the NVRAM settings from the older releases. In the berlin mesh, I placed the files on the HdL cube (NAS device mounted with NFS) on <a href="http://104.65.0.1/nas/">http://104.65.0.1/nas/</a> (go to &quot;styx.commando.de&quot; directory).</p><p>Sven-Ola</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey,</p><p>some comments on comments:</p><p>- ugly sources: yes. FFF is a fast hack not meant for a public developer crowd. I trust in the openwrt devs to provide enough customization hooks for me and others to experimental. And: I don&#039;t have the time to fiddle with MBM for every new NVRAM var I need.</p><p>- speedup dropbear: done something against the &quot;reverse DNS will hang dropbear&quot; (not relevant for openwrt since users are responsible for their resolv config), discarded some extra cryptos, combined scp, dbkey, ssh and sshd in one binary. See db-readme.</p><p>- softdog: kernel module which restarts by timer int if busybox/watchdog is terminated.</p><p>- mtd update: get the MTD version out of cvs (-D 2005-02-28) and do some adaptions (e.g. maps/bcm947xx-flash.c).

					<p>_marc_,</p><p>well, if you zap da NVRAM to the barebone settings this will happen. It&#039;s better to put on the original firmware and execute &quot;reset to defaults&quot;. (Every device specific FW do know more about the device defaults than the multi-device FFF/openwrt). FFF is basically for end users: buy that thing, flash FFF, enter IP and start meshing. With the &quot;customized&quot; FW download offered with our berlin &quot;fetch ip service&quot;, even the &quot;enter IP step&quot; can be omitted. Moreover: Freifunk is and will stay WEPless...</p><p>Rgds, Sven-Ola</p>									</div>

					<p>hello,</p><p>sorry to bother, but I think I&#039;m in need of some assistance.. I think I have bricked my first one (wap54g). Appears that it forgot the bootwait var and after flash to ff fw and reset minutes later it only responds to pings at 192.168.1.245 (I tend to change all to my likeings after flashing) so it&#039;s not responding to pings at 192.168.1.1 at switch on. Do you think I should brake the warranty and short the pins (15-16 or something) though I read on wap 54g it&#039;s not working.. the wap is ver 2 I think with 2mb flash, I have 4 of those, waiting for openwrt based fw which seems not to hapen still allthough I thought ff-fw is a go on it (my wap looks like the same as on the picture on Your site taken from the backside)</p><p>Can You assist me on revive&#039;n it pls, no ?;)</p>									</div>

					<p>this is a specific question, thres the 5 sec reset thing wich always worked, but with wap theres no dmz led for one thing, but pressing it (when I think is right time) does&#039;nt appear to do anything aswell I dont get to telnet to 192.168.1.1 failsafe mode... I was just testing them to see if their radio was ok, if this ones radio is not, I can&#039;t return it if I removed the warranty sticker. Can someone confirm theres no other way than opening it and even so if that will help ?</p>									</div>
