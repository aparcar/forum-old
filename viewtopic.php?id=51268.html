					<p>Hello together,<br />i have successfullly configured my WA850RE as a pseudibridge with relayd.<br />My master router is a fritzbox 7490.<br />My Clients gets the ip form the master router, and they are able to connect to internet.<br />But i cannot the see the windows homegroup. If i connect my clients directly to the master router (via WLAN), everything is ok, the homegroup (folders, printer, etc) appears.<br />As far i have read about it, Windows require NDP (IPV6) for finding the homegroup.<br />Is there a possibility to install relayd for IPV6 (6relayd)?<br />I have played around it, but with no success.<br />Or is this lost time, because this is not possible with relayd ?</p><p>It would be great, if anybody would post the config here, who has solved this in the past time.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Rampler</strong> on 30 Jun 2014, 09:28)</p>

					<p>Maybe my previews posting is a litlle bit misleading..<br />In other words:<br />Is it possible to configure the WA850RE (atheros) as a bridge (repeater), which is working also with IPV6 ?<br />If a using the relayd solution, the windows homegroups doenst work anymore..<br />regards<br />Rampler</p>									</div>

					<p>A have tested 6relayd already, but with no success.

					<p>Openwrt DOES have a bridge that supports all functions, problem is your ISP router doesn&#039;t support it. </p><p>Homegroup is only meant for the basic, dumb, single-router home network.

					<p>@ qasdfdsaq <br />thanks for your information .. <br />I have read both links.. <br />The links says to me, that the &quot;behind the bridge problem&quot; is very common. Many manufactors of bridges have this problem.<br />I&#039;m using a fritzbox 7490 as ISP router.<br />For me it sounds, that the relayd doesn&#039;t support IPV6. Fact is, that the windows homegroup functionality needs IPV6, especially NDP.<br />It seems that nobody here have successfully established a windows homegroup connection behind a bridge with openwrt.<br />I think using a windows homegroup is a common way for the most windows users to share date between pc&#039;s, and therefore it would be very helpful if openwrt supports it with their bridge technology (relayd).</p><p>A have found a way to access my shared folders in windows. After installing the avahi-deamon a see my pc&#039;s in windows explorer, not under homegroups, but under network.</p><p>nevertheless it is not perfect, but i can live with that. <br />Maybe the developer of relayd spents more time in supporting IPV6.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well I can&#039;t say I know what Homegroup uses because... I don&#039;t use it. However I have seen it working behind a bridge many times, but those are &quot;true&quot; bridges not pseudo-bridges like relayd. In order to work, any wireless network or ethernet switch is a bridge. </p><p>Personally though I was brought up in the days before Homegroup existed and learnt to share files using... file sharing. Which works perfectly fine behind any bridge or even over the internet. I don&#039;t actually know anyone who uses Homegroup personally.</p><p>Plus we do already have a version of relayd that supports ipv6 - perhaps the developer of homegroup should spend more time in supporting non-standard networks. Or perhaps the owners of said networks should spend more time making their network behave properly, without using hacks like pseudo-bridges-but-not-real-bridges-pretending-to-be-bridges-and-breaking-various-protocols-by-lying-about-device-ids-and-not-being-a-real-bridge.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>qasdfdsaq</strong> on 27 Jun 2014, 13:52)</p>

					<p>Rampler, this is an old topic, may I ask what your dhcp and or relayd settings are to make ipv6 work over the pseudo bridge?&nbsp; My lan stanza currently looks like:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config dhcp &#039;lan&#039;
        option interface &#039;lan&#039;
        option ignore &#039;1&#039;
        option ra_management &#039;1&#039;
        option dhcpv6 &#039;relay&#039;
        option ra &#039;relay&#039;
        option ndp &#039;relay&#039;</code></pre></div><p>This is on a WZR-600DHP running Barrier Breaker and otherwise the pseudo bridge is working very well for me.</p>									</div>
