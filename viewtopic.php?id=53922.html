					<p>I&#039;ll summarize my findings (and offer my tremendous thanks to CyrusFF for the pointers, patience and assistance!):</p><p>- Android is a tricky, tricky beast.&nbsp; Near as I can tell, once the phone fails to receive a RA (for instance, if you&#039;ve disabled it), it seems it will *never* accept a RA again until the phone is completely rebooted (restarting network services/reconnecting to the network will not help).&nbsp; This is an Android-specific issue that has nothing to do with OpenWRT.</p><p>- Properly performing a tcpdump to capture RA traffic and IPv6 negotiation is also a bit tricky.&nbsp; The following should do it:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>tcpdump -n -i br-lan &#039;(ether host &lt;device MAC address&gt; and not tcp) || (icmp6 &amp;&amp; (ip6[40] == 133 || ip6[40] == 134 || ip6[40] == 135 || ip6[40] == 136))&#039;</code></pre></div><p>- All of my devices (Windows 7, Android, iOS, and Nest) seem to work perfectly fine with SLAAC only (i.e. no DHCPv6 IP address), but you want to keep DHCPv6 enabled if you want IPv6-listener DNS services (and please note that Android _will not_ accept IPv6 DNS information until Android 5, *period* - dnsmasq in OpenWRT will serve up AAAA records over IPv4 just fine, so no real concerns there).&nbsp; If you want a SLAAC-only setup, the following will do it (in /etc/config/dhcp):</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config dhcp &#039;lan&#039;
        ...
        option dhcpv6 &#039;server&#039;
        option ra &#039;server&#039;
        option ra_management &#039;0&#039; # Disable DHCPv6 address handouts, DNS only - i.e. &quot;unmanaged&quot; addressing/A-only</code></pre></div><p>Note that the ra_management stanza must appear under &quot;config dhcp &#039;lan&#039;&quot;, *NOT* under &quot;config odhcpd&quot;, even though it is a dhcpd-only option.</p><p>- A &quot;phantom&quot; additional IPv6 network may appear on your clients (but not your router!) - in my case, it&#039;s fd3f:9257:5a40::/64.&nbsp; It is not a ULA network or anything created by the client.&nbsp; This is harmless (there is no route) and appears to be an OpenWRT issue of some kind.&nbsp; I believe it&#039;s being looked into.</p><p>Hope this helps someone!</p><p>Rodney</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rhester72</strong> on 14 Nov 2014, 05:03)</p>

					<p>Taking a look at the netifd source (specifically interface-ip.c), the following appears to be the case:</p><p>- There is no ula_prefix defined, so it passes the if test and goes one level down<br />- The next check for ula_prefix fails, so interface_update_prefix is never called<br />- Despite the failure of the above check, interface_ip_add_device_prefix is called anyway - culling an address from...random memory?</p><p>I think that third one is where the problem is, and that function should be made part of the &quot;if (ula_prefix)&quot; check on line 994 instead of being blindly called regardless.</p><p>Perhaps this should be split into another thread, I&#039;ll leave that for the ops to decide.</p><p>Rodney</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rhester72</strong> on 14 Nov 2014, 20:43)</p>
