					<p>Sorry to hear you don&#039;t like OpenWRT.</p><p>I don&#039;t know the exact process for a Belkin router. But generally it works like this: You download the appropriate firmware from Belkin and use it to replace the OpenWrt firmware (also see <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.uninstall">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.uninstall</a>).</p><p>Maybe your daughter will help you with that.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MagicSimon</strong> on 10 Jan 2017, 20:30)</p>
