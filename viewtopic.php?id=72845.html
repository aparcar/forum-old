					<p>Hello!</p><p>I&#039;ve been trying to set up a VPN server on a router with OpenWrt installed</p><p>I can successfully connect to the VPN and ping and traceroute work from the client. However I don&#039;t seem to get internet access through the VPN. DNS also seems to work just fine. Using Wireshark it does look like some tcp traffic goes through, so doesn&#039;t look like a Firewall problem. However I can&#039;t seem to be able to create a connection through the VPN.</p><p>Could you please help me out?

					<p>It is rather strange. I don&#039;t think, your firewall has rules separately for 443 port, specific for https. Furthermore you tried to disable it with no effect. Does your curl work fine without establishing OpenVPN connection on your client?</p>									</div>

					<p>What is the proper way to combine the OpenVPN and MWAN3 packages?<br />I&#039;m about to replace my older Attitude Adjustment based MWAN router.<br />I&#039;ve moved to a load-balanced mix of DSL and T-Mobile LTE 4G, but I want VPN too.</p><p>Here are the two obvious topologies:<br />Should I configure and have MWAN3 load balance two VPN connections to different VPN servers (one over each gateway)?<br />Or should I configure one VPN connecion to one server and have MWAN3 try to load balance the traffic on each gateway?</p><p>It seems like it would be better to have two VPN connections, one through each gateway since MWAN3 routes traffic based on the odd/even-ness of the destination IP address.</p><p>Has anyone successfully used multiple gateways (via MWAN3) and VPN?<br />I&#039;ve had trouble before getting VPN to work across T-Mobile&#039;s networks, they seem to inject RST packets.<br />Any suggestions on which VPN service provider to use for this (NordVPN, PureVPN, etc?)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Sorbe</strong> on 29 Dec 2017, 02:31)</p>

					<p>Open two VPN client connections, one dedicated to each ISP (by binding to a specific interface in the configuration).&nbsp; They can connect to the same server if the service allows you to have multiple connections.&nbsp; Then load balance the traffic going <em>into</em> the VPN tunnels.</p><p>Load balancing is based on selecting the least busy ISP for each new connection initiated by a user.&nbsp; When you pass everything through a VPN, there are no new connections to the WAN interfaces.&nbsp; One persistent connection is opened at the start and all the various traffic goes through it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 29 Dec 2017, 03:32)</p>
