					<p>First of all, this is my first post here...</p><p>I got curious and ordered a NEXX WT3020F</p><p>Now i&#039;m wondering how big is the risk to brick the little beast when I try to update the uboot as discribed on the wt3020 wiki.&nbsp; </p><p>Is there somewhere&nbsp; a more step by step manual of this process? (so that I gain more insight in what I&#039;m actually doing?)&nbsp; Or is it just a matter of follow the instructions and learn the details later?</p><p>Main concern is that I dont want to own a brick before I even get started.</p>									</div>

					<p>I skipped the Uboot stuff and flashed CC-rc2 on it, still it would be nice if the Uboot stuff could be explained in a more newbie friendly manner. I have a second NEXX coming my way (in a few weeks) so for that one I will also do the Uboot update.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>the problem with the u-boot stuff is, you can&#039;t flash the u-boot partition with a stock openwrt, because of security reasons, the u-boot partition is write protected and you cannot update it.</p><p>The original NEXX firmware wasn&#039;t on the security alley (at all...) and there you could easily flash a new U-Boot.</p><p>But there is the problem: The u-boot mentioned in the wiki is.... lets say : not good....<br />After flashing this one I could only run exactly THAT openwrt version which came with the archive of the new U-Boot.<br />Any onther openwrt downloaded, or compiled directly would not start at all.</p><p>Luckily, the u-boot web-frontend worked flawlessly and you could reflash another firmware and another u-boot.</p><p>Look in the forum, there is some u-boot-hack (dirty Hack, to be precise, not only violating any terms of the gpl, no its webinterface is also in chiniese or some other language I don&#039;t even recognize the characters....) But at least; This &quot;U-Boot breed&quot; seems to work - it boots ChaosCalmer RC2 right out of the box.</p><p>Hope the guy which named himself &quot;hackpascal&quot; or so will release the sourcecodes, so that some normal characters can be used and the GPL violation ends....</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>att15</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks a bunch for the great explanation att15!<br />Would it be an idea to include that in the wiki until a better solution is available?&nbsp; </p><p>Just because it shows all what is going on in just a few words.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I don&#039;t know it it&#039;s a good Idea... because: I only knew which way&nbsp; to upgrade firmware/u-boot because oft knowing the &quot;old, not really working&quot; U-Boot replacement.... <br />If you havent seen the menu structure, the breed-kind of u-boot is partially unusable...</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>att15</p>									</div>

					<p>I meant including the answer that you just gave me to the wiki. So that it is more clear to others that there is this issue with uboot and that there isnt a real solution. </p><p>The way the nexx 3020 wiki is written it isn&#039;t really clear that neither stock nor hackpascal&#039;s version is trustworthy, allthough hackpascal&#039;s version is preferred when you are doing things that might brick the box.</p><p>I&#039;m going to use my NEXX&nbsp; as a NAS in a LAN and i don&#039;t give it access to go the web, And still i have doubts if this is a good idea. Using the NEXX is a router doesn&#039;t really feel like a good idea with the stock uboot config.&nbsp; And neither with hackpascal&#039;s version.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>So i&#039;m going to search for another mini router with USB that is in the $15 price range. (if anyone can recommend one then please drop me a note)</p>									</div>
