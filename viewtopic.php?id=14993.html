					<p>I have flashed the latest kamikaze 7.09 build (dated 3/21/08) to an Asus WL-520GU router.&nbsp; I installed usb drivers from the 2.4.34 packages: usbcore.o, usb-ohci.o, and acm.o, and get my Motorola phone to show up under /dev/usb/acm/0.&nbsp; I can use microcom to send commands to the modem.&nbsp; My problem is that shortly after I start pppd, get connected, and ping a few servers, the router locks up or reboots (it does both).&nbsp; Sometimes it stays connected for a minute or so, sometimes it crashes immediately.</p><p>My question is this: how do I find out what is causing the router to bomb out?&nbsp; The only thing I could see was right before a crash I ran dmesg and got an error about usb-ohci.o crashing.&nbsp; Should I try UHCI or USB2.0 drivers instead?&nbsp; From what I read, the WL-520gu is supposed to support USB 2.0, but for some reason only runs on 1.1 using the OHCI or UHCI drivers.</p><p>Is there a newer USB package out there that is built for 2.4.35.4? Or does that even matter?</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p>									</div>
