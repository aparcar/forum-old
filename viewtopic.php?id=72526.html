					<p>Hi all!</p><p>I have a Dymond WR03 at home, but due to the nature of the Wifi network I&#039;m&nbsp; trying to connect to, I need to make IP NAT, and this is not allowed in the firmware provided by the manufacturer. Is there any way to install openWRT in this device? It&#039;s not listed on the Table of Hardware.</p><p>Thanks in advance!!!</p><p>Nalonso</p>									</div>
