					<p>Guys, I am totally new to routing and want some help on how to do this:</p><p>1. Non-openwrt router (192.168.0.1) is connected to cable modem and serves wireless clients<br />2. One of its wireless clients is an Asus WL-500gP (Kamikaze 2.6 kernel) router with static IP 192.168.0.51 serving it&#039;s own network of wired clients with IPs 192.168.1.x<br />3. 192.168.0.1 is setup with a static route to forward 192.168.1.x traffic to 192.168.0.51<br />4. What do I need to do on the Asus so that inbound 192.168.1.x traffic can be routed correctly? (Specifically, I have a network printer behind the Asus that all my machines irrespective of network need to access). I can ping 192.168.1.1 from the 192.168.0.x network but not any other machine behind the Asus.<br />5. Outbound traffic from the 192.168.1.x network through the Asus seems to do fine</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>Can you install tcpdump and look at what is reaching the Asus? Since the route information looks, at first glance, to be reasonable, I have a feeling that you are having a NAT problem, either with the first router, or with the Asus.</p><p>A little more diagnostic information would help a lot.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, sounds like you need to disable nat on the asus.</p>									</div>
