					<p>I want to use my buttons in owrt, so i edited to file /etc/hotplug2-init.rules:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>...
         SUBSYSTEM ~~ button {
                 exec kill -USR1 1 ;
         }</code></pre></div><p>to<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>...
         SUBSYSTEM ~~ button {
                 exec /usr/bin/toggle.sh;
         }</code></pre></div><p>the file /usr/bin/toggle.sh contains this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

tmpfile=&quot;/tmp/toggletmp&quot;

if [ -f $tmpfile ] ; then
    echo 1 &gt; /proc/gpio/2_dir
    echo 1 &gt; /proc/gpio/2_out
    rm $tmpfile

else
    echo 1 &gt; /proc/gpio/2_dir
    echo 0 &gt; /proc/gpio/2_out
    echo 1 &gt; $tmpfile</code></pre></div><p>this means this script toggles only the wlan led on my atheros router. The problem is, while the button is pressed the script gets called all the time. I would prefer a message when the key is pressed and when the key is released. Is there a variable available i could use?</p><p>michu</p>									</div>

I created a custom version of reset to trace it a bit and saw that the variables </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>        /* copy keys to our continuous event payload buffer */
        add_msg(skb, &quot;HOME=/&quot;);

I checked those variables with the broadcom build, there they are defined as unsigned long where those variables in the ateros build are defined as int... Ill check this</p>									</div>
