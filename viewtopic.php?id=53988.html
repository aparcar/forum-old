					<p>We are using the cablemodem with a built-in router supplied by our ISP (Comcast). It provides us with both a public IPv4 and IPv6 Addresses. We have some OpenWRT devices connected behind this cablemodem and they have no problems to obtain a private IPv4 address and a public IPv6 address from the cablemodem. However, we wonder if it is possible to disable the IPv4 stack on our OpenWRT devices so that they will just connect and request IPv6 from the cablemodem. Anyone?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mazilo</strong> on 13 Nov 2014, 18:18)</p>

					<p>Well I&#039;m not sure if it is (linux-wise) possible to disable the IPv4 stack but you can certainly disable / remove the dhcp (wan-interface) in /etc/config/network and in addition remove the ipaddr and netmask and related options from the LAN-section.</p><p>The wan6 / dhcpv6 interface alone is able to operate if you set its ifname to the ethernet interface (same value as ifname of wan, as in trunk / CC builds) as opposed to @wan in BB builds which requires IPv4 to be up.</p>									</div>
