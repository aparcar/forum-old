					<p>Hi, I would like to know how OpenWRT assigns the ethernet cards to eth0 ,eth1, etc. I have an Intel dual e100 PCI card and want to be sure that over reboots eth0 is on the same RJ-45. Would be a bit stupid if LAN and DMZ got interchanged... Maybe it is nota problem at all in OpenWRT but I have seen problems with this in the past on other systems.<br />TNX<br />Egbert Jan (NL)</p>									</div>

					<p>The order of the eth interfaces in OpenWrt always stays the same, I never observed a case were they got interchanged without hardware changes (swapped cards).</p>									</div>

					<p>Tnx. And the order that was found has to be extracted from the bootlog??? With three identical cards you need to check the MAC-addresses. Fun.</p><p>EJ</p>									</div>

					<p>Tnx. The driver will be the same for identical cards. So no help from that side. Order is probably decided by mac address. No problem.<br />EJ</p>									</div>
