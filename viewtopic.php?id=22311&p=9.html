					<p>Well this is fun :-)</p><p>Compiled from trunk and flashed my WNDR3700 yesterday, and for the most part, it all works. Thanks! Only issue is lan&lt;-&gt;wan performance.

I&#039;ll try subnetting my network instead of passing the traffic through a bridge, but I doubt that will make much difference.</p><p>Also, I&#039;d like to profile the kernel. For doing this, I&#039;d like to set custom kernel parameters, can that be done relatively easily?</p><p>I will probably not push more than 50Mbps from wan to lan (for now..), but as its also going to be a OpenVPN client I&#039;d like to get as many spare cpu cycles as possible.</p>									</div>

					<p>tysonedwards,</p><p>The recent torrent build was compiled with wpad-mini, which (as far as I recall) supports only PSK. I&#039;ve not worked with Radius support before, but if you want full WPA support, at the very least you&#039;ll need a full version of hostapd.</p><p>It&#039;s possible that you may need to recompile the build yourself to get this.</p><p>You might also be able to get away with just using the torrent build, and then using opkg to install hostapd and wpa-supplicant. The hostapd and WPA supplicant package names seem to have gotten shuffled around a bit in the latest trunk builds, so those may not be quite correct...but it&#039;s something along those lines. Opkg may also ask you to install some other dependencies.</p><p>If you don&#039;t have any luck, try looking around on the general OpenWRT forums/wiki about RADIUS since this should not be a WNDR3700-specific issue.</p>									</div>

					<p>Using essdz&#039;s tracker image right now and everything appears to be working. I do however have one question; I cannot get anything above 130mb/s even with the access point next to the computer. When I put it in the bedroom, where I usually got 200+mb/s using factory firmware, it sits right around 65mb/s. How can I enable full 300mb/s bandwidth on the 5ghz channel. I have switched it to channel 153, the default from netgear which they changed recently to obtain better performance and range I believe, and I have excellent signal strength but still only 65mb/s. I read some others have said they achieved 300mb/s with default settings while another said it took some tweaking. What settings can I tweak to get the speeds up to par? It is useable shorterm i.e. I have internet access working but I would like to take full advantage of the connection.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>skarlson</strong> on 2 Mar 2010, 23:46)</p>

					<p>I flashed my firmware today with the firmware in the torrent file. I am very happy with this as I was able to get everything working. Wireless worked out of the box. Thank you everyone that has worked hard on this firmware. I am a longtime dd-wrt user and this is my first experience with openwrt and I am very pleased with it. Now I am on to find some packages to install. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>I got OpenWRT up and running on my WNDR3700.</p><p>I tried the prebuilt downloads but they don&#039;t work because they don&#039;t honour WiFi country codes. They only allow channels 1-11 on 2.4GHz and _none_ on 5GHz. To get the wndr running as an AP it really needs the &quot;Force Atheros drivers to respect the user&#039;s regdomain settings = YES&quot; option.</p><p>The wiki instructions on building your own image worked great. <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/netgear/wndr3700">http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/netgear/wndr3700</a><br />Thanks to essdz and other writers!</p><p>The changes I made:<br />1)- switched the &#039;option led 6&#039; and &#039;option led 9&#039; around in /etc/config/network. This makes the switch LEDS for Gbit &amp; 100/10Mbit work like it is printed on the router instead of the other way around.<br />2)- added these options to the 2 wifi-device sections of /etc/config/wireless:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>list ht_capab    HT40+
list ht_capab    HT40-</code></pre></div><p>These were needed to get 40MHz bands working. This changed my 11n speed from 65Mbps to 135Mpbs. I only got 1 TX antenna on my EEE901 but 2 RX so download speed is actually 270Mbps, 12-15MBps in real world performance. Very nice.</p><p>The 40MHz bands are checked by the atheros drivers before they&#039;re used. If there more than a few APs in 2.4GHz, they&#039;re not used and you&#039;re back to 20MHz (max 65Mbps for me). The 5GHz area has a lot more room and is used by my AppleTV nicely.</p><p>Thanks to all that made this possible, I really like the OpenWRT+WNDR3700 combo. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>grard</strong> on 3 Mar 2010, 00:40)</p>

					<p>I do agree that it would have seemed more logical to make the LED defaults be the same as original firmware, for consistency.

					<p>I have a theory that my problem is simply that in the wireless config file htmode is set to ht20 which is preventing channel bonding. I did a cat wireless tonight to see the settings; I will vi the mode to ht40+ and then restart wifi to see if that fixes my issues. If the Lord is willing this should give me a fully functioning (I haven&#039;t tested usb but I will worry about that some other time) openwrt build. *tentative yay!*</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>skarlson</strong> on 3 Mar 2010, 02:33)</p>

					<p>No go on my hopefulness. I am going back to the factory firmware until this gets ironed out.

					<p>Ok, I tried again, using just HT20 and the ht_capab HT40+/- and then it did not work. I went into the driver software in windows, again, to check different settings and found one that lists the different frequencies. Some listed just the frequency while others listed a frequency with a (U) or (L); it was set to channel 11 for that setting with no auto setting and changing channels normally works fine without changing it in the driver. So, I do not think that setting really does anything for my purposes in the driver but it did give me the thought that perhaps the netgear adapter only works with certain channels for HT40+/- modes so I switched the router to a channel the driver lists with a (U/L) and viola it works. I am now functional as far as wireless-n is concerned.</p>									</div>
