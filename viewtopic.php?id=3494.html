					<p>I am trying to setup P2P WDS links between my various boxes.</p><p>This is something that I used to have working in the Sveasoft firmware but they have decided to break in the latest release of the firmware and this is the last straw for me with regards that firmware.</p><p>I am running WhiteRussian RC4.</p><p>I have seperated the wifi and lan and moved the lan configuration onto br1.</p><p>I have disabled all wds encryption and iwconfig says the encryption key is off at both sides.</p><p>I have a wds0.49153 interface on both ends.</p><p>If I try to set an ip address on the wds0 interface it gets removed almost straight away I am guessing that hotplug is coming round and setting the interface back to 0.0.0.0.</p><p>Creating a new bridge BR0 allows the interface to come up and putting an ip address onto br0 allows the address to be pingged from the local host but not from the remote host.</p><p>I have removed the S45firewall script to make sure there is no firewall running that might be causing problems.</p><p>The route for the subnet that I am using is pointing to br0. br0 is showing as having the WDS interface in it. If I try and ping the other host then the counters on br0 increase but I dont see any packet counters increasing for traffic going down the wds0.49153 link.</p><p>I have set the boardflags to be 0x0118 and 0x0188 rather than the default 0x0318 and 0x0388.</p><p>If I do a logread then I see the following:-</p><br /><p>Dec&nbsp; 1 04:55:38 (none) kern.info kernel: device wds0.49153 entered promiscuous mode<br />Dec&nbsp; 1 04:55:38 (none) kern.info kernel: br0: port 1(wds0.49153) entering learning state<br />Dec&nbsp; 1 04:55:43 (none) kern.info kernel: br0: port 1(wds0.49153) entering disabled state<br />Dec&nbsp; 1 04:55:43 (none) kern.info kernel: br0: port 1(wds0.49153) entering disabled state<br />Dec&nbsp; 1 04:55:43 (none) kern.info kernel: device wds0.49153 left promiscuous mode</p><p>This repeats every 5 seconds so I am guessing that the WDS link is not coming up properly.</p><br /><p>Has anyone got any other suggestions as to where my problem might be or other things that I could try to try and get this to work?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dw_soothill</strong> on 1 Dec 2005, 07:15)</p>

					<p>It sounds like you&#039;ve done everything right. The hotplug script automatically adds the WDS links to br0; removing the firewall isn&#039;t necessary.</p><p>It may be the wireless link dropping, I&#039;d suggest trying it with both APs in the same room just to verify the setup. If you want to disable hotplug and manually setup the link, &quot;echo xxx &gt; /proc/sys/hotplug&quot; should be pretty effective.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, i&#039;m also moving from alchemy to openwrt (v4 gs problem....) and i&#039;ve almost done all i need.<br />I only stil have problems with wds in p2p mode.. i can connect&nbsp; through wds in lan mode, but not p2p... i&#039;ve read the faq, i understand i have some way to break the br0 common setup and split the wireless part from the lan part, but it seems i can&#039;t do it following the FAQ..<br />It gives me no particular error, but no ip is assigned to the wds0.etc interface.<br />Iget an error in the last command only..<br /> i follow this example setup:</p><p>lan_ifname=vlan0<br />lan_proto=static<br />lan_ipaddr=192.168.1.25<br />lan_netmask=255.255.255.0</p><p>wifi_ifname=eth1<br />wifi_proto=static<br />wifi_ipaddr=192.168.2.25<br />wifi_netmask=255.255.255.0</p><p>wan_ifname=vlan1<br />wan_proto=dhcp</p><p>lan_ifnames=vlan0 eth2 eth3</p><p>Wan is not used, when i send the lan_ifnames command it reports that eth2 and eth3 devices do not exits (which seems reasonable).<br />I tried googling for more info but no luck...<br />Any idea?<br />Thanks,<br />Ricky</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>karyal</strong> on 3 Dec 2005, 18:27)</p>
