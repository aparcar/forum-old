					<p>I have a linksys wag354g that recently stopped working(it just stopped working. Woke up one day, noticed i had no internet connection and found out that the router wouldn&#039;t work). Now when i turn it on( that is connect the power adapter) the power led turns red and stays like that. I tried to send a new firmware using tftp but there is no response from the router(even ping wont work). Following the pinout on the wiki i soldered some headers for the serial port and tried to connect to it but i get nothing(and even when i tried to connect a speaker i got nothing which worries me). I also tried to jtag to the router but neither urjtag or hairydairymaid will detect the chip(cable works, i have tested it on an old pda...). Is there anything i can try or should i just throw it away? Thanks in advance...</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t know about a Linksys WAG354G device. However, on a Linksys PAP2 device, a red color on power LED usually associates with a bad AC/DC adapter. See if replacing the AC/DC adapter will fix this issue.</p>									</div>
