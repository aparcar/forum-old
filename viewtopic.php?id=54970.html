					<p>Also, this package fails to cross compile on OpenWRT as seen below.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindBoost.cmake:1194 (message):
   Unable to find the requested Boost libraries.

   Boost version: 1.59.0

   Boost include path:
   /opt/openwrt-git-trunk/staging_dir/target-arm_mpcore_uClibc-0.9.33.2_eabi/usr/include


   The following Boost libraries could not be found:

           boost_unit_test_framework

   Some (but not all) of the required Boost libraries were found.  You may
   need to install these additional Boost libraries.  Alternatively, set
   BOOST_LIBRARYDIR to the directory containing Boost libraries or BOOST_ROOT
   to the location of Boost.
 Call Stack (most recent call first):</code></pre></div><p>The above error messages clearly indicate grive requires boost_unit_test_framework module from boost package. This module will.ONLY be available when <strong>Boost test package</strong> option is enabled. Unfortunately, boost will not cleanly compiled when this option is enabled, especially on the PLXTECH/Oxford NAS782x/OX82x platform.</p><p>Perhaps, the discussion on this <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=36994">post</a> will help OP.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mazilo</strong> on 25 Aug 2015, 17:10)</p>
