					<p>Can someone show me how to use ipkg to check for packages which need updating?</p><p>On Redhat / CentOS Linux, I&#039;ve used &quot;up2date&quot; and &quot;yum,&quot; both of which have built-in options to check the versions of the installed packages, and the versions of the packages on the server, and report (or actually update) out-of-date packages.&nbsp; I&#039;m willing to bet that ipkg can do something like this, but for the life of me I can&#039;t figure it out!</p><p>Possibly related to this, I can&#039;t figure out ipkg&#039;s &quot;compare_versions&quot; command:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>compare_versions &lt;v1&gt; &lt;op&gt; &lt;v2&gt;   compare versions using &lt;= &lt; &gt; &gt;= = &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;</code></pre></div><p>What does that mean? What are v1 and v2?</p>									</div>

					<p>This option is just for comparing version strings, not installed and available package versions, so it won&#039;t help you with the update part.</p><p>Examples:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ipkg compare_versions 1.0 &#039;&lt;&#039; 2.0.1
ipkg compare_versions 1.0 &#039;&gt;&gt;&#039; 2.0.1
ipkg compare_versions 1.0 &#039;=&#039; 2.0.1</code></pre></div><p>The output of this command is misleading. You get &#039;An error ocurred, return value: 1.&#039; and &#039;Done&#039; on screen, but you should send that to /dev/null and use the exit code which is... also a bit misleading (in shell context), because it is 1 for &quot;true&quot; and 0 for &quot;false&quot;. And the &#039;&lt;&#039; and &#039;&gt;&#039; operators are the same as &#039;&lt;=&#039; and &#039;&gt;=&#039;, and for strict &#039;lower than&#039; and &#039;higher than&#039; operators you have to use &#039;&lt;&lt;&#039; and &#039;&gt;&gt;&#039;.</p>									</div>
