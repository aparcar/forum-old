					<p>I had a go at installing OpenWRT on my router.&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty definitely broadcom-based, but it&#039;s a Belkin F5D7630uk4A, which is listed as Untested on the OpenWRT wiki.</p><p>Reading up on the similar 7230 made it seem like it shouldn&#039;t be too hard, although the web interface won&#039;t take the firmware image and the firmware file format looks different (I hexdump -C&#039;d it). I&#039;m damned if I can persuade it to take a tftp upload of anything.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried two machines on various thernet ports with tftp and atftp.&nbsp; With one machine, I can see the router bring the link up and down while rebooting.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried clearing the arp cache while the router is down.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried looking for different IP addresses as well as the factory default and its currently-configured one.&nbsp; Anyone know how to get OpenWRT on one of these?</p><p>While messing about, I uploaded the latest Belkin firmware and that&#039;s improved network stability, but added a new problem.&nbsp; After the router has been up a few hours, WPA fails to my main laptop.&nbsp; The only way out seems to be reboot the router, rinse and repeat, so I&#039;d really like to have OpenWRT on there instead, so I&#039;d stand a chance of debugging it!</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help.&nbsp; Ask if you want more detail and I&#039;ll try to post it.</p><p>MJR</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MJR</strong> on 19 Mar 2007, 18:17)</p>

					<p>Following a message from Belkin support, it seems that the current version of their firmware only works properly with WPA on channels 1, 6 and 11.&nbsp; Please can anyone help get OpenWRT onto this pig?</p>									</div>

					<p>Last year, I had the same problem with trying to get dd-wrt on a F5D7230-4. I found that adding a 28-byte header to the file allowed me to upload the firmware through the Belkin&#039;s web interface. Perhaps the same method would work for OpenWRT.</p><p>Here&#039;s a description of the header:</p><p>1. The first four bytes are &quot;LOAD&quot;. <br />2. The next four bytes contain the length of the file including the header, in little-endian order.<br />3. The next four bytes are the CRC-32 checksum of everything but the first 12 bytes of the file. I used the command <em>cksum -o 3</em> in OS X to calculate this checksum. The file contains the one&#039;s complement of the result of this calculation, i.e. flip all the bits, and again, the bytes are in little-endian order.<br />4. Next comes 00, 80, and then 14 more 00s. You have to prepend this to firmware before you can calculate the checksum in the previous step.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>This is my first post on the forum, so bare with me!</p><p>I&#039;ve been looking into &quot;modding&quot; my router to increase the output power and give me more control, but I&#039;ve been worried about demoting it from router to housebrick, so I&#039;ve been trying to find someone else who has installed OpenWRT on the same router.</p><p>Have you had any luck with this?&nbsp; I&#039;d be very interested to know if you managed to get it working.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>annex666</strong> on 31 Jul 2007, 22:46)</p>
