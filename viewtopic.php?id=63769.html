					<p>Look at the summary memory data in &#039;top&#039;</p><p>It clearly shows that most of the RAM is dedicated to the file cache, which is what Linux tends to do when it doesn&#039;t have other uses for RAM.</p><p>As noted above, it appears that busybox free doesn&#039;t report cached data and instead lumps it in with &quot;buffers.&quot;&nbsp; Even so, its a strong hint that it is being used for caching filesystem/io related data. </p><p>I don&#039;t think there is anything odd it not using swap if you consider that you still have a lot of free RAM and that OpenWRT is, at heart, an embedded OS for systems with no reasonable backing store for a swap file. A good chance that the defaults of various tuning parameters are set to avoid swapping, even if a swap file is configured.</p><p>What I do find odd though, is that you have 20GB for swap on a 2GB machine.</p>									</div>

					<p>In Linux, unused memory is wasted memory. As others have pointed out, what you are seeing are cached files. Unless your machine starts using swap, I would not care at all. Just to be sure, stress that machine (open some files using SAMBA, browse some configuration pages, ...) and see if it starts using swap.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>Anaerin wrote:</cite><blockquote><div class="quotebox"><cite>eas wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>What I do find odd though, is that you have 20GB for swap on a 2GB machine.</p></blockquote></div><p>I was allocating partitions in cfdisk and may have slipped an extra 0 in there.

In case some process goes gets crazy, I would rather have a smaller swap (and let that process fail) than have a larger swap and see the machine become unresponsive.</p>									</div>

					<p>Anaerin, swap was useful on RAM-starved systems, but with 2 GB of RAM, unless you&#039;d use suspend or hibernation, you don&#039;t need that much. 1 GB would be plenty. Like eduperez says - you don&#039;t really want a giant swap space when a program messes up, it only slows down your system longer before the program in question gets the boot.</p>									</div>
