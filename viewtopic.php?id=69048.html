					<p>I&#039;m running CHAOS CALMER (15.05.1, r48532) on a Linksys WRT1900ACS.</p><p>I have my network set up on 192.168.1.0/24. I want to set up a second subnet on 192.168.2.0/24 using the same physical interface. The first subnet is for clients with static addresses and the second is for dynamic IPs for other clients that come onto the network.</p><p>To avoid configuring IPs manually on the static clients, I am trying to get static leases handed out by DHCP. However, this seems to be creating a problem with the two DHCP pools.</p><p>Here are my /etc/config/network settings so far:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;lan_static&#039;
    option ifname &#039;eth1&#039;
    option force_link &#039;1&#039;
    option type &#039;bridge&#039;
    option proto &#039;static&#039;
    option ipaddr &#039;192.168.1.100&#039;
    option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;

config interface &#039;lan_dyn&#039;
       option ifname &#039;eth1&#039;
       option type &#039;bridge&#039;
       option proto &#039;static&#039;
       option ipaddr &#039;192.168.2.1&#039;
       option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;</code></pre></div><p>And then I&#039;ve set up the DHCP pools in /etc/config/dhcp like this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config dhcp &#039;lan_static&#039;
    option interface &#039;lan_static&#039;
    option start &#039;64&#039;
    option limit &#039;16&#039;

config dhcp &#039;lan_dyn&#039;
   option interface &#039;lan_dyn&#039;
   option start &#039;100&#039;
   option limit &#039;16&#039;
   list dhcp_option &#039;6,8.8.8.8&#039;</code></pre></div><p>I&#039;ve also configured static leases for the clients that I want to be on the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet, e.g.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config host
    option ip &#039;192.168.1.1&#039;
    option mac &#039;xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx&#039;
    option name &#039;workstation&#039;
    option dns &#039;1&#039;</code></pre></div><p>However, when the clients with static leases connect to the network, they receive IPs in the 192.168.2.0/24 subnet rather their static IPs. The static leases were getting assigned just fine before I added the &#039;lan_dyn&#039; interface and DHCP pool.</p><p><strong>Is it possible to use static leases like this in the presence of two network interfaces with separate DHCP pools?</strong></p><p>My aim is to push out different DNS addresses (and search domains) to the different subnets, so I don&#039;t want the static clients to receive the DNS set with dhcp_option for &#039;lan_dyn&#039;. Maybe there&#039;s a better way to acheive this? Do I need a second instance of dnsmasq?</p><p>Thanks for reading, I&#039;d appreciate any suggestions or tips to help me get this configured.</p>									</div>

					<p>You dont need 2 interfaces.<br />Use one interface 192.168.2.0/23 (192.168.2.0 255.255.254.0)<br />2.0 for static<br />3.0 for dynamic<br />Its not possible to do this with 1.0 and 2.0 because of bit logic.

					<p>Thanks for the replies.</p><p>@eduperez I&#039;m actually trying to isolate the subnets (should&#039;ve mentioned that, sorry). Is there another reason it&#039;s a bad idea?</p><p>@bolvan I see I can use an offset higher than 255 to send out IPs in a higher subnet.

For example, pppoe or even better ipsec.<br />Or you can use VLANs with terminating managed switches so clients cant just assign eth1.&lt;privileged&gt; and have full access. They must not have physical&nbsp; access to trunk wire.</p><p>Openwrt also does not seem to support aliased interfaces like eth0:1.<br />If you setup an alias it will be added to one physical interface eth0 and you cant separate firewall rules because they are zone based and zone is defined as set of interfaces.<br />But you can use macvlan if you wish to setup 2 virtual ethernets connected to the same wire and have 2 fw zones for them.<br />For a single eth0 all you can do is to use fw rules based on source address.<br />In any case source IP or MAC can be easily changed.</p><p>Wireless networks already have built in authorization and encryption layer. Create multiple SSIDs with separate networks, address assignment and firewall rules.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bolvan</strong> on 23 Dec 2016, 12:43)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the detailed info. It&#039;s not really for security, but for convenience. Maybe I&#039;m doing it wrong, though. IP-based firewall filtering is totally fine for my purposes (again, not for security), athough admittedly using zones would be more convenient.</p><p>I think what the question boils down to the following: <strong>can I provide different DNS addresses to static and dynamic IP clients on the same interface?</strong></p><p>The way I&#039;m thinking of doing this is as follows:</p><p>1. Tag all the computers with static addresses using the `tag` option in the static lease block.<br />2. Set up DHCP to hand out IPs with an offset &gt; 255 to dynamic clients.<br />3. Send out the DNS and local domain that I want the dynamic clients to have to ALL clients (i.e. static and dynamic) using the `dhcp_option` option.<br />4. Send out the DNS and local domain that I want the *static* clients to have using `dhcp_option` with the appropriate tag value for the static clients.</p><p>I hope #4 overrides the DNS sent out by #3 for the static clients, I&#039;ll try it and report.</p>									</div>
