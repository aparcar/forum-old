					<p>Why are you so interested in the old unsupported Backfire?</p><p>You should perhaps use the current trunk, where libubox, ubus etc. are by default. Trying to add those low-level libraries to an ancient release may be rather difficult, as several packages are so intertwined and may also depend on current kernels etc.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 17 Mar 2014, 13:58)</p>
