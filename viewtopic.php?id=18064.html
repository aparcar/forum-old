					<p>First, thanks to all who developed this excellent release.&nbsp; This has made my 634U MUCH easier to use and configure. This router was sitting on the shelf due to my limited technical skills in trying to configure OpenWRT via configuration files.&nbsp; LuCI has made this so much easier.</p><p>I am having troubles opening a port in the firewall to a FTP server on my lan that is on a static lease.&nbsp; I have played with the zone and traffic redirection and my iptables looks good (as far as I can tell):</p><p>Chain zone_lan_forward (1 references)<br />target&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;prot opt source&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;destination<br />zone_wan_ACCEPT&nbsp; all&nbsp; --&nbsp; anywhere&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;anywhere<br />forwarding_lan&nbsp; all&nbsp; --&nbsp; anywhere&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;anywhere<br />zone_lan_REJECT&nbsp; all&nbsp; --&nbsp; anywhere&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;anywhere</p><p>Chain zone_wan (1 references)<br />target&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;prot opt source&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;destination<br />ACCEPT&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;tcp&nbsp; --&nbsp; anywhere&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;192.168.1.150&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;tcp dpt:21<br />input_wan&nbsp; all&nbsp; --&nbsp; anywhere&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;anywhere<br />zone_wan_REJECT&nbsp; all&nbsp; --&nbsp; anywhere&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;anywhere</p><p>However, I am unable to connect through the WAN.&nbsp; Addressing the server via LAN works fine.&nbsp; Am I understanding correctly that there is a hole in the firewall, but I don&#039;t see a forward entry.&nbsp; Is this my problem? Thank you for your help.</p>									</div>
