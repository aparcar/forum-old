					<p>Hello,</p><p>I found this while I was searching for board pictures <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=539053">http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=539053</a> and I agree with them <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>If you want to try to run OpenWRT on this small machine, know that OpenWRT currently does not have ADSL drivers.</p><p>So this device would be used for a wired router with VLAN support eventually.</p><p>Please post pictures of the board where we can read the labels of the chips. We also have to see if it is possible to connect a serialTTL cable to the board, JTAG,...</p><p>Also if you can get into the current firmware with telnet/SSH and issue and &quot;sh&quot; command, do you get a # prompt? If yes - post the boot log or output of dmesg command</p><p>Post the boot log if you have access to it from the Web interface.</p><p>Thank you.</p><br /><p>P.S. from the firmware files on TP-Link website I see that the v2 (haven&#039;t checked v4) board_id most probably is 96338L-2M-8M this means 2MB flash and 8MB ram if we believe the tag.</p><p>Maye it is possible to fit OpenWRT on 2MB flash if you compile it yourself as a very stripped version. The image that could work would be the Broadcom generic one, if the CFE accepts it at all.</p><p>Check this to see what you&#039;re signing up for if you choose to try it: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=128156">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=128156</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>NetworkPro</strong> on 24 Feb 2011, 22:59)</p>
