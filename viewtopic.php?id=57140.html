					<p>When I took a look at <a href="https://github.com/GBert">Gerhard Bertelsmann GitHUB repository</a>, I noticed he has several repositories, i.e. openwrt-misc, railroad, easyCAN, openwrt-files, and misc. So far, I am interested in the first two repositories and added them in my feed.conf file as shown below. After doing a <em>scripts/feeds update packages_misc railroad</em> and <em>scripts/feeds install packages_misc; scripts/feeds install railroad</em>, I see both repositories have been added and copied to feeds/packages_misc and feeds/railroad, respectively. Mission accomplished. So far, so good.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>src-git packages_misc git://github.com/GBert/openwrt-misc.git
src-git railroad git://github.com/GBert/railroad.git</code></pre></div><p>Now, is it possible to organize these newly added repositories into a sub-directory (i.e. feeds/GBert) such that I will have feeds/GBert/packages_misc and feeds/GBert/railroad, respectively? If so, how?</p>									</div>
