					<p>hey guys</p><p>i just wanted to ask if there are any known issues/pitfalls when trying to change the default network setup? my goal is to have 3 different subnets:<br />a bunch of servers directly attached to the internal switch (192.168.0.0/24), one subnet for wired clients (via uplink from one of the switch ports, 192.168.1.0/24) and a third subnet for wlan (192.168.3.0/24) - each of them with different firewall rules etc.</p><p>i guess in any case i have to remove the br0 bridge to have eth0 and eth1 seperated from each other...but does the default setup purely depend on that bridge (e.g. removing the bridge bricks my router because of some firewall settings etc.)</p><p>concerning the server- and wired-clients-net: do i have to work with vlans or is such a setup impossible anyways?</p><p>thanks for your replies in advance, rudi</p>									</div>

The choice would depend somewhat on how much access/separation control you want between the servers and clients (eg do you want firewall rules?) Judging from your description I would set up a new vlan for the servers.</p><p>- DL</p>									</div>
