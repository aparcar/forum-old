					<p>On my home network I have a TP-Link router (192.168.1.1) running latest OPENWRT with 2 HDD&#039;s connected. Everythings works great when connectd to my main router, I can access network shares, etc.<br />Now, I have a Fonera Simpl router connected to it (192.168.10.1), and I&#039;m using it as access point to internet when I&#039;m outside of my home. But I cannot access my HDD&#039;s connected to the OPENWRT router. I can access the routers admin page, I can also access other 2 routers admin page (192.168.1.3 and 192.168.1.4) when connected to the Fonera, but cannot access other computers, so I believe that it forwards connections on port 80, but nothing more.<br />I&#039;m trying to configure the main router to accept connections to enable SAMBA access (TCP 137, 138, 139 and so on) but I can&#039;t do it. I believe it may be the Fonera firmware that doesn&#039;t allow this, but does anyone have any idea or solution to this?<br />Already mailed Fon, and asked about this, they said it wasn&#039;t possible. Asked to add the Bridge mode to Fon router, as the Fon 2.0 has, but they said it was up to develooment team...<br />Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MataRatos</strong> on 28 Apr 2015, 22:34)</p>
