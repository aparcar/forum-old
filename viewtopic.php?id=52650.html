					<p>Hi all, i gave up on the WRT1900AC and now want to go about setting up my first install on an ATOM X86 board with two gigabit ethernet ports.<br />Managed to get Attitude Adjustment 12.09 r36088 loaded on a CF card and got it to boot without a hitch. I can log into luci via browser at 192.168.1.1<br />I had to create a new DHCP interface for the WAN, and that appears to work ok as an interface.. within luci I can go into the diagnostic page and ping ok.</p><p>Here&#039;s my problem!! I can&#039;t get onto the internet....I&#039;ve tried various settings in the firewall within luci and nothing! I&#039;ve read the openwrt wiki&#039;s on networks still not managed to sort it.... I need help please <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>Just want to keep it simple to start with, a simple WAN and LAN to laptop with the aim of adding a VPN down the line.</p><p>Cheers for any advice.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think you have to add a few rules on the Firewall to allow DHCP renew. I don&#039;t know how to do it, as I&#039;m new at Open-wrt.<br />But, maybe this helps. Check the page <em>Network-&gt;Firewall-&gt;Traffic Rules</em></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/v11AuWz.jpg" alt="Open-wrt Firewall" /></span></p><p>However, I can&#039;t guide you anymore from here on.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes exactly..my first attempt at configuring openwrt on the x86 platform was rubbish and thats why i came on here asking for some help or direction.</p><p>Since posting this thread, i came to the conclusion nobody with some experience wanted to help a newbie take this forward so i abandoned openwrt.</p><p>Now using debian 6 on my atom board and learning linux along the way, video tutorials on y*utube helps greatly. Im almost there with it now..vpn and ftp left to configure.</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to reply dpj and tkgcmt</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I&#039;m guessing you&#039;ve tried this already, but try again, please:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap</a><br />or<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedclient">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedclient</a></p><p>I&#039;ve tried both, but everytime I did so, I was unable to connect neither the internet nor the router itself. What I missed was that I had to renew my PC ip (I use Windows, so I all had to do was <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ipconfig /release
ipconfig /renew</code></pre></div><p>But you can do the same pulling the cable off then putting it in again. Or, if wireless, disconnect and reconnect. See if that is the case... it&#039;s silly I know, but I was one victim.</p>									</div>
