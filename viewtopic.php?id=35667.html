					<p>I have an ALFA Hornet UB (<a href="http://www.alfa.com.tw/in/front/bin/ptdetail.phtml?Part=Hornet_UB&amp;Category=107225">http://www.alfa.com.tw/in/front/bin/ptd â€¦ ory=107225</a>), and I&#039;m trying to get OpenWRT on there. I selected the AR7XXX/AR9XXX target system, then picked the &quot;ALFA Network Hornet-UB board&quot;. I transferred a uImage to the board using the u-boot that it shipped with to do tftp, and I booted to the transferred image, and I get &quot;MIPS: machine is Generic AR71XX/AR724X/AR913X based board&quot; in the boot messages I think I&#039;m supposed to see &quot;ALFA NETWORKS Hornet-UB&quot; (from the MIPS_MACHINE macro in mach-hornet-ub.c).</p><p>I&#039;m more familiar with ARM; I know that with those, there is a machine type that is passed from the boot loader to linux in a tag list. A wrong machine type would cause this on an ARM system. Is there something similar for MIPS? If not, what might be causing the above problem?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello everyone,<br />sorry for the thread gravedigging but i thought it would have been better to post in an existing thread instead of opening a new one.</p><p>I was thinking about getting this board (or router with this board) as it looks like pretty cheap&nbsp; (in price) but feature rich.</p><p>Still i&#039;m really a newbie when it comes to router flashing, and openWRT in general, i browsed the documentation page, the sources repository and the specific device page, but couldn&#039;t find anything that would help me out in understanding how to flash this device.</p><p>Do i need a serial cable to flash this board? or i can access the U-Boot in another way?</p><p>can anyone kindly point me to an exaustive documentation on how to deal with this board + openWRT?</p><p>also if anyone know (hope this is not against the forum rules, eventually feel free to contact me via PM), i&#039;m looking for a place to order this board (or preassembled router) from EU, i&#039;ve found it on an USA shop, but buying from here, the shpping costs + taxes would cause the price to double.</p><p>thanks in advice.</p>									</div>
