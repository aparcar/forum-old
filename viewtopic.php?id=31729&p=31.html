					<p>Hi all, first of all this forum made me to use a lot from my router. I have a question that, I need to bridge my internet that comes from USB with Ethernet. Basically I managed to connect my tablet to 703n but I cannot route the internet to Ethernet device. What should I change in the network settings? Using the wi-fi from there as well would be awesome. </p><p>Thanks,</p>									</div>

					<p>Good.&nbsp; I think you are fine now.<br/>As for the ip address of your 703n, why don&#039;t you try to do an &quot;ipconfig&quot; or &quot;ipconfig /all&quot; from your command window on your notebook first to see if you can fine out which is your notebook&#039;s address and maybe also the 703n&#039;s address.&nbsp; If not you can use a free program called &quot;Advanced IP Scanner&quot; from <a href="http://www.radmin.com/">www.radmin.com</a> (or similar ones).&nbsp; Set the scan address range to be the entire subnet that the notebook is on and it should tell you all of the ip addressed on the subnet being used including the one used by 703n.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>twinclouds</strong> on 26 Jun 2012, 09:33)</p>
