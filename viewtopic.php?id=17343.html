					<p>Hi,</p><p>Currently, the avr32 architecture only supports the ngw100 board. But there are multiple boards available today. The Linux kernel also supports the atstk1000 series for example.<br />So I would like to propose that one can choose which board to build for. How is this best accomplished? Are that best called profiles or sub-targets?</p><p>In current development, we are working on a daughter board for the ngw100. What is the best way to integrate this into OpenWRT? The board is application-specific and will never be generally available. So it is of no use to try to push it to the Linux main tree. It is something that will only live in my archives. The solution of overriding some files (see other message) is something I consider a temporarily fix.</p><p>Any comments?</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Bas.</p>									</div>
