					<p>Hello. I registered to this forum hoping to get some help with my Bytton GPRS wireless router. So here it goes.</p><p>I bought this router from a second-hand dealer. It has OpenWRT Kamikaze installed and it worked fine &#039;til the moment when I had to move it. I disconnected the adapter, which means that I cut the power to the router (it doesn&#039;t have an ON/OFF or Shutdown button) and after reconnecting it it didn&#039;t assign an IP address for the computer. So basically I have no way of communicating with the router. The LEDs labeled Power and AIR and LAN 1 to 4 are all fine, meaning that they glow as normal.</p><p>I tried setting a manual IP address for the computer, but no connection could be made towards the router. No ping reply, no browser interface, no telnet. I also tried to reset the router to factory settings by pressing and holding the Reset button on the back of it, but nothing happened. Later I learned that by default the Reset button in OpenWRT is disabled so it won&#039;t do anything unless it&#039;s installed.</p><p>The only occasion that the router is responding is when I boot it while I keep the Reset button pushed. Then the Power LED starts blinking and if I set manual IP for my computer, then I get ping reply from 192.168.1.1. But as far as I know this mode is used only if someone wants to reinstall the firmware.</p><p>And I don&#039;t wish to reinstall the firmware. I just want to reset the router to factory settings if there&#039;s a chance for that. Or start the DHCP somehow. I hope I provided all the info needed to understand the situation and solve it. Please, any help or piece of advice would be greatly appreciated. Also, if you have some tips to avoid these kind of situations in the future, I would appreciate those too.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello again. Yesterday I reflashed the firmware of the router. It worked fine for a few minutes, but then trouble came again. The router stopped communicating with the computer. Reflashed again, made my settings but it died again. And this time I didn&#039;t cut the power. The GUI just stopped working and if I clicked on Repair in Network Places it didn&#039;t get IP address.</p><p>So I guess I&#039;m doing something wrong and the problem has nothing to do with electricity. Basically what I do is follow <strong>Void Main</strong>&#039;s steps described in a topic that I found on this forum. The link to this topic is: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=23185">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=23185</a> Besides this I&#039;m bridging the LAN interface with wl0 so that I can have Internet connection on my laptop while connected to the router through ethernet cable. </p><p>Now I&#039;m not sure if the steps described above are the correct ones, but so far I managed to have Internet connection. The only problem is that communication between the laptop and router stops after a while.</p><p>If I&#039;m not doing the right thing, then how should I proceed? I&#039;d really appreciate some clarification even if I&#039;m the stupid one and messing up things :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>OK. So I&#039;ve learned that wl0 shouldn&#039;t be bridged with lan.</p><p>Thanks for the &quot;many&quot; answers and clarifications! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/neutral.png" width="15" height="15" alt="neutral" /></p><p>Cheers.</p>									</div>
