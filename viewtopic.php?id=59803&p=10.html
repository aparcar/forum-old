					<p>Hi, Thanks for a wonderful adblock implementation. </p><p>I am having a similar problem with YouTube delays - it seems about 20 seconds that the ad normally takes. Chrome F12 tools shows doubleclick.net and googlesyndication.com failing - which is good. I&#039;m not prepared to enable those sites. The easiest way to test is in incognito mode of Chrome. The 20 second delay appears the first few videos.</p><p>I&#039;m using the default adaway, disconnect and yoyo lists with no other modifications.</p><p>My question is: Is there a way to block the ads but not have the delay?</p><p>Thanks heaps<br />Graham</p>									</div>
