					<p>Hi Everyone,</p><p>I&#039;ve got a Belkin F5D8230-4 v1000, which has the broadcom 4704 processor and airgo card. I&#039;ve got openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx on it and ssh is up and running. The webif worked for a bit, but I don&#039;t care so much about that, as ssh and cli is my friend.</p><p>I wish to use an openWrt router as a linux server... to serve DNS queries from the WAN through a(nother) router to this openWrt box. The ISP for my website isn&#039;t the greatest and if we are one of the two primary DNS servers, we&#039;ll have actual redundancy.</p><p>Could anyone point me towards examples or how-tos? I&#039;ve read and searched all over and I&#039;ve been at it so long, I bet I had the answers in the first weeks of my learning but forgot now! :-) and now I&#039;m getting a bit stumped on what to do...</p><p>I have done:<br />Set a static IP address 192.168.1.199 and netmask via the webif.<br />Have good ssh to said address with the WAN port of the router plugged into my router.</p><p>Currently, I broke the webif, but it might just need restarting ... I can&#039;t find where I saw how to do that, so I would appreciate to know either some steps to get it working and/or/more preferably, how to configure the IP address and various other settings via ssh.</p><p>To summarize, I would dearly appreciate some help with:<br />- setting the static WAN IP via cli ?<br />- would it be better for me to use one of the 4 LAN ports? (if so, how to set the IP...)<br />- how to remove unneeded packages from the filesystem? (it&#039;s ok to tell me to reflash with something else)</p><p>Thanks!!<br />Chris</p>									</div>

It isn&#039;t a real dns server but it caches queries so if you ask the same host again the query isn&#039;t passed through to the dns server.</p>									</div>
