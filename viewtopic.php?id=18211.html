					<p>Some projects I would like to do that might help with providing a recommendation.</p><p>Would like to pickup an existing wireless networks signal and rebroadcast it for private use (don&#039;t have control over existing wireless networks router). In that case I think I need one product to pickup the signal and have an ethernet cable going to another product to rebroadcast it.</p><p>Another project is to cover a church with wireless coverage. Would like it if I could have a multiple access points with only one plugged into the internet. Also it would be nice if I could restrict wireless access from accessing the internal network that the wireless router is connected to.</p><p>Another project is to cover a ski resort with wireless access (resort, not the mountain). Internet connection is coming in via satellite connection. Right now there is a directional antenna pointing towards the cabins (which are all in a row going away from the internet source) however the signal doesnâ€™t reach past the first couple of cabins. Would like to extend this signal to cover all cabins. Also the resort has a campground on the other side and it would be nice to cover that with wireless someday.</p><p>Would like to get wireless internet setup at another ski resort that has nothing but an AP covering the main building. Also has a campground acrost the river.</p><p>Would like to get an internet connection at the baseball field that is less than Â½ mile from my house so we can post stats, live video feed, etc.<br />Would like to startup a wireless mesh in my neighborhood someday.</p><p>I think that is all my dream projects.</p>									</div>

					<p>I really wish I could get openwrt to work on my router (different topic - wrt350n v1.1) - but I can&#039;t so I&#039;m stuck with DD-WRT at the moment. </p><p>DD-WRT isn&#039;t bad - and if you aren&#039;t interested in customizing your setup in very big ways, it&#039;s good. The CLI stuff on it seems to be a bit twisted - and openWRT&#039;s command-line stuff seems to match normal linux stuff a lot better...</p><p>I want to use openWRT because (I think) it is relatively easy (once you know what you are doing) to build your own custom images with just the stuff you want on them (in my case, I want a usb-enabled version that has hfs+ filesystem support compiled in and UPNP / DAAP / and&nbsp; Samba servers on it - don&#039;t know how long it will take me to get that far)</p><p>X-wrt seems to be aiming for a happy medium - but I haven&#039;t looked into it all that much.

					<p>It is a lot of fun building custom images with OpenWRT for your routers/firewalls/gateways, though I have found the images produced by dd-wrt are often well trimmed for most router&#039;s small flash chips. I have also found the DD-WRT builds generally more reliable, this is why I would have to vote for DD-WRT but I would suggest you try OpenWRT first.</p><p>What I HATE about DD-WRT are the forums which are filled with rude and intolerant moderators as well as posters who should have spent a few minutes in the wiki before posting stupid questions making the moderators even more intolerant. Also having to pay for &quot;professional&quot; licenses so that you can get access to USB Storage and raise your maximum allowable connections, when a similar addition/mod on ANY linux distro is free.</p><p>If you are going for x86 builds I would suggest IPFIRE (About to release 3.0) or IPCop (Just released 2.x), I didin&#039;t enjoy the BSD monowall or pfsense OS&#039;s (iptables &gt; pf). You could also try ClearOS if you want something really heavy for a higher end x86 or x86_64 computer.</p>									</div>

					<p>You cannot compile recent dd-wrt builds with all functionality, only retro builds.<br />They have said that people were making custom dd-wrt firmware, flashing devices and marketing their wares under the dd-wrt brand, which is what dd-wrt does; if you happen to visit their store you will see it for sale.<br />I have seen other tools around that will let you take apart their prebuilt images and put them back together with added functionality though I&#039;m pretty sure the images would end up unnecessarily large.</p>									</div>

					<p>There are a lot of reasons to migrate from DD-WRT to OpenWRT if you were to ask folks here. OTOH, folks on DD-WRT will tell you otherwise.</p><p>I came from DD-WRT world. I must admit that its firmware has a much nicer GUI, but lacks functionality. To me, this isn&#039;t good. For a few years, I had used both together, i.e. a Linksys WRT54GS v3 with DD-WRT as my main router, some Linux embedded devices with OpenWRT, etc. I have used OpenWRT since 2007 to run asterisk on a LaFonera FON2100 device. At the time, I had to choose between them. I decided to go with OpenWRT and never feel regret of my decision. Then, I have completely migrated to OpenWRT two years later on, IIRC. Now, my main router is a Netgear WGT634U and some Linux embedded systems are connected behind it. All of them are now running on a self-built OpenWRT firmware with a single source for multi platforms. With DD-WRT, this is almost an impossible task to achieve.</p><p>I like OpenWRT for a number of reasons. I can build the firmware from ground up, including the cross compilers -- something DD-WRT isn&#039;t capable of doing, IIRC. This makes OpenWRT not dependent on any 3-rd party cross compilers (SDK), but can be configured to use them, too.</p><p>To summarize all, OpenWRT is more flexible with more functionality (more software programs). At any rate, one will need to spend some times to migrate from one place/system to another in order to feel comfortable with the new surroundings/systems and this is not an exception.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m surprised that someone said that OpenWRT has better compatibility. I always found that something that OpenWRT doesn&#039;t like (like Broadcom or VXWorks) just won&#039;t be covered. So for the longest time I have DD-WRT on my WRT600N and a VXWorks WRT54G that I picked up for 2$ at a second-hand store. But maybe OpenWRT is better at covering less mass-market devices.</p><p>You may also have to futz with OpenWRT in order to get some of the latest-greatest wireless options. Which means you might end up having to compile the firmware. DD-WRT doesn&#039;t really have a problem enabling that by default.</p><p>But DD-WRT has a lot of magic where you have to re-flash multiple times and make the right incantations for it to work. If you ever get into command line configurations or package installation you will be sorely disappointed with DD-WRT. </p><p>I also never got the impression DD-WRT was the most efficient with device or the most reliable. But that might be leftover impression from years ago. I want to be able to leave the router running without intervention indefinitely. Which is what you are planning on doing to (?).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>napierzaza</strong> on 22 Dec 2011, 16:12)</p>

					<p>OpenWRT is a lot better. Once you know your way around building you own image (which is quite easy), you&#039;ll realize it true power in customization. It turn your router into a small computer which you can install many many application that suit your project/purpose and remove others you don&#039;t want. I got to admit that wiki is a bit unorganized but if you search hard enough, the info is there. If you&#039;re comfortable with console, it&#039;s a lot easier than dd-wrt anyway.</p><p>My 2 cent.</p>									</div>
