					<p>Hello to all, excuse my English.&nbsp; <br />Buy a tp-link CPE510 V2 (UNITED STATES), I am making an investigative work for my university, I don&#039;t seek to break the laws, it is exclusively for educational use. I need that my hardware operates in supporting way to be able to work in several frequencies. If somebody knows as achieving this that explains to me, I have looked for in several formun and they tell me that it is not possible because this anchored the region in a space of storage of readonly and that you cannot change. I test the firmware with TEST_MODE TP_PharOS_2.0.0_161117 but it doesn&#039;t allow me to change the region although makes hard reset </p><br /><p>Thank you to all<br />Muchas Gracias a todos</p>									</div>
