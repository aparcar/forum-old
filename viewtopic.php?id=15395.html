					<p>This frequency range is almost certainly not supported by the chipset in your device, though the supported frequencies do vary by device.&nbsp; Even if it did work, it would be vary illegal in almost any country.</p><p>P.S. Upon closer inspecting an Atheros based card that I have the lowest frequency that it supports is 2312 MHz, which is actually surprisingly low but still nowhere near your given range.</p>									</div>

					<p>If theres any commercial viability on the band ubiquiti might be able to help you (<a href="http://www.ubnt.com">www.ubnt.com</a>)... they&#039;re doing 11b/g @ 700 and 900 mhz, and 11a at 3.5, so they obviously have the technology.</p><p>I personally use both of their 900 products with great results.</p>									</div>
