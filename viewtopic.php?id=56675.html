					<p>Hello All,<br />I am interested in using my wifi router as a VPN for all devices that connect to it wirelessly. I have been reading OpenVPN documentation, but most of it is for different setups, such as running a server. But I don&#039;t need to run a server, I&#039;d just like to use a VPN for Internet for security on my mobile devices.</p><p>Here&#039;s what I have done so far:<br />ssh from LAN into my OpenWRT router...<br />opkg install openvpn<br />openvpn --config &quot;MyVPNProvider.ovpn&quot;<br />At this point, it connects perfectly, and routes traffic from the OpenWRT device through the VPN as you would expect.<br />However, connecting to the OpenWRT router wirelessly results in it using the LAN internet instead of the VPN. &lt;--</p><p>Ideas? I&#039;d prefer to do this as simply as possible from ssh terminal.</p><br /><p>Is there some way to ip route wlan0 traffic through the tun0? <br />Preferably without complex firewall rules etc, because I may use this for travel and inet info will change as I go behind different routers. Just need simple way to VPN my Hotspot.</p><p>Thnx in advanced guys. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>johndoe</strong> on 17 May 2015, 00:48)</p>

					<p>Bump.<br />If you guys can point me to the correct wiki page? I don&#039;t want a server, I want a VPN client that VPNs all connected devices to hotspot. Please advise.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have pretty much the same question though a few threads down. Wanna have one radio that goes over tun0/openvpn and all the others just regular. No clue how to set this up. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>

You just need to change the configuration in your OpenWrt router. What device are you using for your OpenWrt router? Does your router have a separate WAN port?

					<p>Ok, this seems quite doable. I have not enough time to give you full instructions right now, but I can give you some pointers:</p><p>* You have your eth and wifi interfaces bridged together, so there is effectively only one network, and your router sits on the side of it; you need to break that bridge, so the router sits in the middle of two separate networks.</p><p>* Configure a WAN network on your eth interface (no bridging) as a DHCP client, a LAN network on your wifi interface (no bridging either) with a static IP address (try to configure an unusual range here, to avoid conflicts with whatever IP address you get on your WAN interface, 192.168.222.x is probably a good option, for example) and a DHCP server, and a VPN network (should be configured as default route).</p><p>* Now you should be able to log into the router (ssh / luci) using wifi, and connect to the internet (opkg update) from the router.</p><p>* Disable any forwarding from LAN to WAN, but enable from LAN to VPN.</p><p>Be careful will all these changes, or you may lock yourself out of the router.</p>									</div>

					<p>jackCalc: Thank you SO MUCH. That article is exactly what I&#039;ve been trying to do for months. There&#039;s a few confusing spots, but I managed to work through it. Once you get unbridged it and setup the firewall rules it was good to go. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p>									</div>
