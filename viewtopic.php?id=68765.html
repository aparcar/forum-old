					<p>Hey Guys, </p><p>as always when i or someone in my family needs an accesspoint a bought myself a TP-Link WA901ND but this time i couldn&#039;t flash it with my self-build WA901ND v4 Firmware...</p><p>Now i found out after some research that TP-Link had to follow some EU-Regulations to prevent Users from flashing modified Firmwares. </p><p>Is this a known issue? Are there any Ways to remove this Protections and flash OpenWRT?</p><p>Thanks in advance for your comments. </p><p>KR<br />Faithless</p>									</div>
