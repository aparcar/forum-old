I have a similar setup using a UML295 (presents itself as an ethernet interface which is awesome and also has GPS) that I take with me on the go. The AR150 should be able to charge the phone as well - but I don&#039;t think its going to provide a ton of current. In my case - the USB is faster than using a wifi connection between the router and the phone since i&#039;m usually using another client in the mix to do my browsing (it doesn&#039;t need to &#039;relay&#039; the data over the radios, saving bandwidth and energy.) I&#039;m a bit confused about your comment about wifi vs 3g - but usually when I&#039;m using this box - i&#039;m rebroadcasting my phones LTE connection to Wifi so other clients can use it.</p>									</div>

That makes more sense.&nbsp; I think we have two different use cases here. Like I said in my previous post, I&#039;m using my MLWg2 to share my iPhone&#039;s LTE connection over Wifi or ethernet.

I&#039;d use OpenWRT for my home routing - but I prefer Debian due to the wide array of available packages (Wireshark and Virtualbox just to name a few).</p>									</div>

					<p>Can someone help me please?</p><p>So after reading all these discussion in the forum for couple of days I decided to install OpenWRT in my Kingston MLWG2. I followed the exact same instructions in the readme file except for one step (well.. tried to be oversmart <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/yikes.png" width="15" height="15" alt="yikes" />). </p><p>I downloaded the &quot;openwrt-15.05-rc3-ramips-mt7620-mlwg2-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin&quot; file and renamed it as &quot;openwrt-ramips-mt7620n-mlwg2-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin&quot; and copied that to the SD card and then rebooted my MLWG2. After re-booting it I dont see the wifi enabled on the device (I dont see &quot;OpenWRT&quot; as SSID when I scan for WiFi networks). I see the green light (which indicates charge) and the blue light (which is the bridged LED ) ON. I am not able to connect to my device either through WiFi or through Ethernet. </p><p>I used a microSD card 32 GB formatted as MSDOS FAT using mac.</p><p>Can someone help me please..</p><p>EDIT: If I switch off the MLWG2 and connect it via a USB cable to my mac I am able to see the SDcard and its contents.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>abc90_xyz91</strong> on 2 Sep 2016, 11:16)</p>

					<p>Hi elektroman.</p><p>Thanks for your message. I have read the document but, unfortunately, I can not make the device to boot in failsafe mode.</p><p>I do not own a serial console, so I have tried the two first methods. None of them seem to work as:</p><p>1) There is no light blinking when powering on the device. When I turn it on (long press of the power button) I have both the battery and the bridged connection lights on (yellow and blue, respectively). I kept it on for minutes. Nothing happened.</p><p>2) I have connected it to my computer, configured my ethernet port to IP 192.168.1.2, started Wireshark on that interface and then I turn the MLWG2 on (with the long press). Some packages are captured, but all of them originate in my computer. Nothing coming from 192.168.1.1 is received.</p><p>Is the device hard-bricked? Should it be sending the broadcast package through the Ethernet port?</p><p>Thanks again for your help.</p>									</div>

					<p>hi i am new to openwrt,<br /> i have a mlwg2 for which i flashed the openwrt firmware through USB method <br />,everything was working fine luci webui worked BUT as papapapa (post 183), i did the wireless repeater thing to extend my wifi,but after reboot the wifi was disabled and the power led and Ethernet led is only on, as i know this after reading entire thread that the firmware of this openwrt don&#039;t have reset button working,</p><p> i tried <br />&gt;to see if the universal repeater is working through the lan,<br />-so first of all let&#039;s say a mobile hotspot was repeated to the mlwg2 the ip it assigned was 192.168.137.1 and subnet 225.225.225.0<br />-i did a nmap/zenmap on that ip through windows 10 laptop lan port , where i got some 9 ports open ,<br />-hmm so i thought there is no problem with the board of mlwg2 , <br />-i have a tenda n300 router which now i made again a universal repeater so when mobile hotspot was off does this tenda act like mlwg2 through lan(nmap/zenmap)? yes it did (not a big achievement)<br />-ok heard about packets sniffing , installed windump(alternate to tcpdump) on my win10 pc and ran cmd with &#039;windump -i 2&#039; where 2 is Ethernet interface. got a ton lot of packets but i did not capture it ,i could later.<br />-something fishy was, i saw a hex pattern on the windump cmd with on the right column had ......w.....<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .....d......<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ....w.......<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ......d.....<br />-but this hex was for two times and was in couple seconds after boot. </p><p>&gt;next heard about making a static IP so that mlwg2 will connect, but no luck or maybe i need more advice from you guys</p><p>&gt;what about that mlwg2_header.bin found in zip file ?<br /> i did not use it while flashing, i carefully did what read me file said. i don&#039;t say my flashing was wrong, i am saying that setting a repeater without checking if the wlan was on/off was a mistake.<br />.........<br />so can i buy a USBtottl device, so that i can get into boot sequence and get it to failsafe mode?<br />should i say i ruined this engineering marvel mlwg2 beyond repair?<br />........<br />i think so i can and i will try what ever i can to get this beast to work again.<br />ps. i had this device for quite a few years used this device to it limits, but now i stumbled upon openwrt where i can get even more functions of this tiny monster.<br />......<br />and i am stuck here anyone advice me please.</p>									</div>

					<p>The only advice I can give you is IF you do get this working, do not screw with it.&nbsp; </p><p>This device is a community supported device as opposed to a OpenWrt supported device.&nbsp; Big difference.&nbsp; There is no dev support behind community supported devices other than a handful of very interested parties with a wide variety of skills.</p><p>At this point there is really no-one working on this and I will not even upgrade mine.&nbsp; The lack of the reset functionality is the big concern.&nbsp; There is no way for the common man to recover it at this point.&nbsp; </p><p>The best alternative for a battery device is the GL.inet MIFI.&nbsp; I am not aware of any other supported device with a battery, but there are a lot less expensive alternatives for a repeater.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.gl-inet.com/mifi/#1442566104699-323f13c3-dd9d">http://www.gl-inet.com/mifi/#1442566104 … f13c3-dd9d</a></p>									</div>
