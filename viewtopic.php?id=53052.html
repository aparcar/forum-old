					<p>A number of people have been working toward the goal of making the entire OpenWrt site more friendly to newcomers (as well as being up to date, correct, and more usable). You can see the discussion of the individual tasks at our Github site: </p><p><strong>Github list of issues:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/prplfoundation/openwrt-doc-initiative/issues">https://github.com/prplfoundation/openw … ive/issues</a></p><p>There is a parallel effort to make the Table of Hardware (also called the &quot;Supported Devices&quot; page) better. This is under active development. Read the forum at: </p><p><strong>Improving the ToH:</strong> <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=56521">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=56521</a></p><p>Finally, we have some concrete proposals for the the OpenWrt.org home page and the top page of <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org">http://wiki.openwrt.org</a>. Although these pages can only be edited by core developers, we have drafted replacement text for those pages. You can read the drafts at:</p><p><strong>DRAFT OpenWrt Home Page: </strong> <a href="http://test.richb-hanover.com/openwrt-redesign">http://test.richb-hanover.com/openwrt-redesign</a><br /><strong>DRAFT Replacement for OpenWrt wiki home page: </strong> <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/playground">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/playground</a></p><p>Comments are welcome - each page has a link for posting your thoughts. For the three Guides (Newcomer, Experienced User, and Developer) I would like to hear thoughts for organizing the content for those three important jumping off points.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>richbhanover</strong> on 29 May 2015, 04:09)</p>
