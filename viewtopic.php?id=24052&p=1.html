					<p>hey... im starting this thread for anyone who wants to install and configure OpenWRT to work properly on the buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH.</p><p>I, like many others, have had issues with dd-wrt semi-bricking routers, though the process to fix them is just mildly annoying, actually having to do it again and again trying to get dd-wrt to work is even more annoying... </p><p>many of us believe dd-wrt is heading down a bad path and are looking for a true open-source firmware that just works with all the features we need on this router.</p><p>so, converting from factory, or dd-wrt, here we are.</p><p>....................</p><p>problems ive noticed running open-wrt on the router in question is the wireless driver isnt installed right away, ive had to install a couple packages, i believe kmod-ath9x was the one that did it for me... also i notice there seems to be a bit of an issue with the LEDs for WLAN and security... also, i was unable to get any more user friendly UIs installed because though i want the customizability of dd-wrt, i personally wouldnt mind something that looks and feels more like a router interface than a linux OS.</p>									</div>

					<p>Although dd-wrt currently works on my router, I&#039;d like to try OpenWrt for samba and transmission support. But setting up OpenWrt with all those packages looks like a complicated and not well documented process for such a beginner like myself. Does anybody has and is wiling to share with us OpenWrt binary which is compiled for G300NH with pre-installed packages (for wireless, dhcp, usb, samba, ntfs, transmission, etc.)? That would be a great start...</p>									</div>

					<p>that would be perfect... as the g300nh is capable of torrents, network storage via usb... but when you install openwrt, theres a package manager you can go to to select packages that itll automatically download and install for you when you choose to add them... so it doesnt take much to click on transmission and samba to add those features to the router, just install it, select kmod-ath9x, transmission, samba, and maybe a couple other packages and youre good to go</p>									</div>

					<p>Support is excellent.&nbsp; I have been using openwrt on my WZR-HP-G300NH for a while: I am running Samba, uShare, Transmission (torrent daemon) w/peer blocking all while being an actual router.&nbsp; I started with Luci a couple months back but ended up dropping it in my last trunk compile: luci is really nice, but I kind of like the linux box feel and luci is missing a few options.</p><p>I highly recommend you include niceness in your compile for start-stop-daemon.&nbsp; Should be under busybox options I think (don&#039;t recall exactly where).&nbsp; I was having all sorts of trouble with uShare until I gave it a niceness level above everything else.&nbsp; Now it works flawlessly.</p><p>I&#039;m running 20337 at the moment and am having trouble tracking down a strange (and my only real) problem.&nbsp; At first I thought it was related to port forwarding however it turned out not to be that.&nbsp; Regardless the problem itself is massive lag spikes in games.&nbsp; I have tried ./firewall stop, taking out redirects, adding the option -n to dnsmasq (--no-polling), disabling miniupnpd and routing all my ports manually.&nbsp; Only thing I haven&#039;t tried is plugging the modem directly into my computer to play, though I&#039;ll be doing that tonight I think.&nbsp; The problem itself manifests after some time playing and once it does (once I start to notice the lag spikes) I also notice that my previously open ports specified in /etc/config/firewall are now closed.&nbsp; Yet I can still ping the router from wan.&nbsp; Restarting the firewall doesn&#039;t fix it, I have to reboot.</p><p>Kind of wish I could tie one of the buttons on the router to start/stop ushare.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t figured out how yet, but haven&#039;t looked all that hard either.&nbsp; Just mentioning it here in case one of you knows where to start.</p>									</div>
