					<p>Eduperez,</p><p>If I am understanding this correctly the issue has to do with the fact that a MAC address of say a device requesting a DHCP assignment is not transmitted across the bridge. </p><p>This seems to be the only issue with a wireless bridge??</p><p>This is circumvented however with a fixed IP address correct? WHich takes me pack to the configuration part.</p><p>Let me point out also one other item. in a typical WAN / LAN router scenario, OpenWRT WILL bridge the LAN and WIFI segments , correct? I mean this IS A NORMAL ROUTER FUNCTION.&nbsp; This is all I really need . It is not important to me that the MAC of origin is transmitted as that seems relevant only to DHCP requests and I would be using all Fixed IPs anyway .</p><p>Here is another reason why i believe it to be the configuration.... I reset the device and put the WiFi on LAN side , disable the DHCP and connect it to my wireless access point. Now i want to access openwrt device from my wifi laptop and I can not . So something is hinky here even without the bridge. </p><p>Mark</p>									</div>

					<p>No, this is not a DHCP issue, it affects all traffic; see:<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode#bridged_client_mode_issues">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clie … ode_issues</a><br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_R … n_Protocol</a></p>									</div>
