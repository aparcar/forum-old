					<p>hi.<br />I&#039;ve installed Attitude-adjustment firmware on my tp-link mr3020.<br />Then i configured wi-fi network with no encryption on it.<br />I have four devices connected to this network:<br />1. Windows 7 desktop<br />2. Windows 7 notebook<br />3. Ubuntu tv stick mk908<br />4. Android phone.</p><p>mk908 carries an apache web server.<br />notebook also carries web server for test purposes.</p><p>Just after connecting to wireless network i have no problems with retrieving pages from mk908 web server to any of my devices.<br />But when windows devices (desktop and notebook) stay idle for some time (just a few minutes) i have &#039;host unreachable&#039; error, when accessing to mk908 web server. Meanwhile at the same moment accesssing from android phone and from router(via ssh) to mk908 works well, also accessing from desktop to notebook web server works good too at this moment.<br />After some retries accessing to mk908 web server restores and pages refreshes good until next period of inactivity on windows devices. I have disable power saving on wireless modules in windows devices.</p><p>Is this problem in router or in windows? <br />If i try to ping mk908 from windows after few minutes of inactivity, i receive answer:&#039;host unreachable&#039; or &#039;no route to host&#039; for some first ping requests (2 or 3) after some tries ping works ok.</p><p>p.s. sorry for my english <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Upd.: Access to mr3020 router itself (ping, connect to ssh etc) works well always on windows computers.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>subver</strong> on 17 Jan 2014, 04:29)</p>
