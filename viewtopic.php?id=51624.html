					<p>I opened the case to get to the serial port of my Linksys WRT1900AC.&nbsp; For anyone who is interested in the details of how the case is put together, I put some pictures online:</p><p><a href="http://www.smugmug.com/gallery/n-7PLVB/">http://www.smugmug.com/gallery/n-7PLVB/</a></p><p>There are only four screws in the bottom to hold the case together - one in the center of each foot.&nbsp; Once the screws are removed, the blue front part slides forward easily.</p><p>I&#039;m sure there is a way to get into the rest of it without breaking it, but you probably need some small, thin tool to slide in and push some of the latches open.&nbsp; There are 5 latches across the back of the unit and just one towards the front on each side.</p><p>One thing to mention is the construction around the rear feet - the top half of the case makes up part of each rear foot.&nbsp; The two halves come apart by sliding the top half directly upwards.&nbsp; That&#039;s especially difficult due to the latches that you have to pry loose (or break some of them as I did), but even with the latches released, it was still quite hard to get the top off - seems that it presses together rather tightly.&nbsp; One thing that may help is to put something under the top half&#039;s part of the foot and pressing down on the bottom half.</p>									</div>
