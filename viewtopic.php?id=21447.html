					<p>I have an openvpn server running on my 8.09.1 router.&nbsp; My clients are able to connect to the VPN server and also ping/access the IP of the VPN server, however they are not able to reach any IPs behind the router (the routes are set up properly).&nbsp; Before I upgraded to this version (from 8.07) I used these rules:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -A INPUT   -i tun+ -j ACCEPT
iptables -A FORWARD -i tun+ -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT  -o tun+ -j ACCEPT
iptables -A FORWARD -o tun+ -j ACCEPT
iptables -A forwarding_rule -o tun+ -j ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -A postrouting_rule -o tun+ -j MASQUERADE</code></pre></div><p>However, they don&#039;t seem to work anymore.&nbsp; Does anyone know how to set this up properly (preferrably in /etc/config/firewall)?&nbsp; It needs to work both ways as the VPN is connecting two LANs. </p><p>Thanks for any help!<br />Thomas</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello </p><p>I use these iptable rules in my &quot;/etc/firewall.user&quot;:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>## Set tun device to act as connection to the internet.                                      
## Notice the -o tun+. This indicates that it is looking for outbound packets on tun+
iptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -o tun+ -j MASQUERADE  

## Accept all outgoing traffic to the internet
iptables -I OUTPUT -o tun+ -j ACCEPT

## Allow all outgoing forwarding
iptables -I FORWARD -o tun+ -j ACCEPT

## Allow only ESTABLISHED inncomming packets. 
## I guess this is for normal web browsing
iptables -I INPUT -i tun+ -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

## Allow all incoming FORWARDed packets
iptables -I FORWARD -i tun+ -j ACCEPT

## Defining spesific routes for port forwarding
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i tun0 -p tcp --dport 40098 -j DNAT --to 192.168.2.102</code></pre></div><p>If still no joy.. check if you can ping an resolved IP on the internet. </p><p>Best regards<br />Ivar</p>									</div>
