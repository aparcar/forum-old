					<p>Ok, I&#039;m updating this thread for others that might also face the same issues I did.</p><p>I managed to get the Atom system up and running with OpenWrt. I didn&#039;t try installing OpenWrt on my Core i7 (didn&#039;t want to under-utilize the Core i7 since the default binaries don&#039;t support SMP, will hopefully compile a custom build for that later on and post instructions here).</p><p>The binary I used is the chaos calmer 15.05 RC1 64bit<br /><a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05-rc1/x86/64/openwrt-15.05-rc1-x86-64-combined-ext4.img.gz">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal … xt4.img.gz</a></p><p>Instruction (hopefully for beginners) on how to do so from a Linux system:</p><p>1- download and extract the chaos calmer image:<br /> #wget <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05-rc1/x86/64/openwrt-15.05-rc1-x86-64-combined-ext4.img.gz">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal … xt4.img.gz</a><br /> #gunzip openwrt-15.05-rc1-x86-64-combined-ext4.img.gz</p><p>2- Connect your SSD drive to your linux system (best way to do so is via SSD-to-USB adapter available at amazon.com).</p><p>3- Find your drive name: <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; #fdisk -l (e.g. /dev/sdb1 &lt;= this is just an example, be super careful in figuring out the name of your connected SSD drive)</p><p>4- Copy the image to your ssd: <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; #dd if=./openwrt-15.05-rc1-x86-64-combined-ext4.img of=/dev/sdb1 (again, /dev/sdb1 is an example, be super careful on what drive name that corresponds to your SSD).</p><p>6- Connect the SSD to your Atom system via SATA.</p><p>6- Now connect a usb thumb drive to your linux then partition and format the thumb drive as ext4 (google how to do so in linux)</p><p>7- Download and copy the following packages to your newly formatted thumb drive:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05-rc1/x86/64/packages/base/kmod-pps_3.18.11-1_x86_64.ipk">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal … x86_64.ipk</a><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05-rc1/x86/64/packages/base/kmod-ptp_3.18.11-1_x86_64.ipk">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal … x86_64.ipk</a><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05-rc1/x86/64/packages/base/kmod-e1000e_3.18.11-1_x86_64.ipk">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal … x86_64.ipk</a></p><p>8- Connect your usb thumb drive to your Atom.</p><p>9- Make sure you have either a PS/2 keyboard or a usb keyboard connected via usb-to-ps/2 adapter to your atom. (Note: Not all USB keyboards work with a usb-to-ps2 adapters, try several ones until you find the one that works with a usb-to-ps/2 adapter).</p><p>10- Connect the atom to a monitor and boot it up.</p><p>11- Once you notice the boot process progress stopped, press Enter, you should then gain access to the console.</p><p>12- Set a password for root<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; #passwd</p><p>13- Mount your thumb drive:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; #mkdir media;mkdir media/usb<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; #mount /dev/sdb1 media/usb (note: /dev/sdb1 is an example, lookup the usb drive name from /dev folder, google if you&#039;re not sure how to mount a usb drive)<br />14- Create a temp folder and copy the package files off of your thumb drive to your SSD.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; #mkdir temp_inst<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; #cp /media/usb/k* /temp_inst</p><p>15- install the packages<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; #opkg install /temp_inst/kmod-pps_3.18.11-1_x86_64.ipk<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; #opkg install /temp_inst/kmod-ptp_3.18.11-1_x86_64.ipk<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; #opkg install /temp_inst/kmod-e1000e_3.18.11-1_x86_64.ipk</p><p>16- You&#039;re done. You should now be able to login to your router web interface from your PC. Set your PC network adapter IP address to manual 192.168.1.2 and direct your browser to http:/192.168.1.1. The password for web interface should be the same one you setup at step 12.</p><p>Hope the above help others with Atom x86 hardware.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>h7</strong> on 24 May 2015, 00:46)</p>

Love everything about what you wrote. No need for the RS-232 adapter (nor a ps/2 keyboard) as the network drivers are going to be already installed via the rc.local calls and people could simply ssh to their x86 and remove the commands from rc.local (to prevent calling them on every boot).</p><p>Then people could simply direct their browsers to 191.168.1.1 to access the LuCI web interface and configure their x86 router from there.</p><p>thanks for the this.. really helpful tips.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>h7</strong> on 23 May 2015, 21:28)</p>

					<p>Just another quick update. The latest Chaos Calmer OpenWrt 15.05 RC1 64bit turned out to be SMP enabled.</p><p>I noticed that while checking the CPU info on my Atom system.</p><p>This encouraged me to install it on my Core i7 using mk24 technique (without a keyboard as my Core i7 board has no PS/2 ports).</p><p>The installation was successful. However I noticed there seems to be incompatibility issue with the Intel e1000e_3.18.11-1_x86_64 driver and the Network adapter on my Core i7 board as speedtest.net bandwidth test fluctuated a lot (dropped from 100Mbps to 18Mbps and back to 100Mbps).</p><p>Perhaps it&#039;s some configuration in the bios, or perhaps I should try a trunk build. In any case, I just wanted to report that the Chaos Calmer RC1 is SMP enabled.</p>									</div>
