					<p>@beginner67890</p><p>Thank you very much for your time writing back and trying to help. To sum it up: My router is running now since 18 days, no reboot. The last dmesg bug was the same I wrote before about:</p><p>[Dec22 15:53] swap_free: Bad swap file entry 00000c00<br />[&nbsp; +0.005019] BUG: Bad page map in process sleep&nbsp; pte:00060000 pmd:1bd74831</p><p>I deactivated the script the same day, which has the sleep 20 command in it, and since then, no bug report anymore in dmesg, no reboot/crash. So I totally believe it is related. Beause Three times before, when I looked into dmesg I saw this too, and then randome time later, the router rebooted.</p><p>I totally believe, that it is connected to the same problem the 1900v1 has with CPUFREQ and CPUIDLE. Maybe the sleep command triggers it somehow, and because no one else (than me) uses a script here, which has a sleep command in, no one sees those reboots.</p><p>I politely asked David to include the patch too for the WRT1200AC but he just laughed at me with some rude comment. So I have to build my own build at some point I guess, which I havent tied so far, because I thought the WRT1200AC is not officially supported by the native Lede source, and David had implemented patches in his build inviroment, which he does not make public, even I also asked politely for that.</p><p>It seems if you just use the router as a potato (not much cpu and ram load), it is &quot;stable&quot;. So this seems why no one else notices these issues. But I am dependent on bash scripts which uses a sleep, so I want to see this be fixed.</p><p>My other theory is, that the RAM isnt clocked correctl, whatever reason for, maybe a false config file somewhere in the code. This would lead to a maybe slightly overclocked RAM, leading to memory corruptions and reboots. The sleep may trigger this way sooner than it normally would happen, maybe because every 20 seconds, a new random part of RAM is filled and released, which normally wouldnt happen. Opening Luci may also trigger this, or other RAM related programs, running on the router.</p><p>@meffovic<br />I think &quot;sleep x&quot; is used in some bash scripts of Lede per default too, I dont know which one though, mostly some watchdog scripts.</p>									</div>

Expecting a patch that possibly solves a problem with the WRT1900AC cpuidle to also work on the rest of the routers would be a very strange coincidence. I haven&#039;t looked into the cpuidle recently so maybe things have changed except that has always been a problem for the Marvell SOCs. These proposed fixes have been tried before and there have been some low level problems preventing their reliability every time. These experiments have always been reverted after testing. </p><p>2) I am sure davidc502 knows a lot more about these problems and whether there has been a breakthrough finally allowing the advanced cpufreq and cpuidle features of these Marvell designs.</p><p>3) Please do not expect davidc502 to become a developer in addition to the maintainer for these builds. I am certain he communicates with the developers who work on the code and adopts their patches when he feels they are stable so expecting him to also test and troubleshoot the code is arguably going too far.</p><p>4) The same cpu is clocked to much higher frequencies on the newer Linksys routers. I really doubt there is a problem with timing on the WRT1200AC because of the most conservative clocking of all of these routers. Here is a good place to track down the answers to your questions:<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt_ac_series">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt_ac_series</a></p><p>I also have a lot yet to learn.

					<p>makedir-</p><p>Sure, I can accept your terms. I would hope you could also give davidc502 his space.</p><p>I agree the page faults are a serious problem. I would certainly want to find the solution if they happened to my router. They sometimes can be due to looking for a file that is missing or looking for a bad memory address for example. I suppose a faulty memory chip or bad timing could be seen as the same type of memory problem by the kernel. I hope you find the reason.</p><p>I imagine the kernel expects certain features to be supported across the board by all cpus and might cause a problem when a certain cpu doesn&#039;t provide the basic features. Perhaps just disabling the cpuidle and cpufreq isn&#039;t enough and the kernel tries to use the features anyway causing the problems with the sleep command or other timing requirements. That is just speculation because I haven&#039;t looked into the actual way the kernel would react in this case. There is a lot more I don&#039;t know in addition.</p><p>Good luck.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi.<br />Do we have a stable wifi in 2018? I wonder. Reading pages of the forum and it&#039;s still issue after issue.<br />I am copy pasting new drivers *.bin to any kernel (i really don&#039;t want to go through long router upgrade procedure each time - once in a year is the limit).<br />Why we have to change kernels? When this become stable. With new minor version of kernel, cannot apply packages posted.<br />And when this project will get auto-update, 100% configuration kept.<br />Some people would just like their router run reliably 24/7, instead of playing with vanilla configuration.<br />It&#039;s a huge different between vanilla router and configured router.</p><p>*was travelling for one month, and the router survived! (thanks to the tons of safeguard scripts). Well, except wifi. Which i didn&#039;t need remotely. But im back and wifi is dead in few days repeatedly:/</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wrtuser123</strong> on 13 Jan 2018, 00:44)</p>
