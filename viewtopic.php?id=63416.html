					<p>I have two separate networks linked togeher by two openwrt routers running Attitude Adjustment and OpenVPN.&nbsp; They have been working seamlessly.&nbsp; What I have done is defining the tun interface in /etc/config/network, adding a vpn zone and then adding rules allowing traffic between lan and vpn zones in /etc/config/firewall.</p><p>I then tried to upgrade openwrt from Attitude Adjustment to Chaos Calmer.&nbsp; I&#039;m testing this setup with no luck by duplicating what I have done on the Attitude Adjustment platform.&nbsp; But packets just cannot go through these two routers.&nbsp; I found that I have to add the following rules in /etc/firewall.user to make them work: </p><p>iptables -I INPUT -i tun+ -j ACCEPT<br />iptables -I FORWARD -i tun+ -j ACCEPT<br />iptables -I OUTPUT -o tun+ -j ACCEPT<br />iptables -I FORWARD -o tun+ -j ACCEPT</p><p>So my question is how to translate these to rules in /etc/config/firewall and /etc/config/network.&nbsp; What&#039;s the difference between these two releases?&nbsp; Any one has a clue?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; It&#039;s OK (and easier) to include the tun0 interface in my LAN zone instead of creating an additional VPN zone.&nbsp; Just curious is there any way to avoid using these four custom rules by using GUI?&nbsp; My original setup for openwrt 15.05 need these custom rules to be functional, too.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi sl6xx, if you put the tun0 interface in the LAN zone through the GUI and forwarding is set to Accept in firewall rules for the zone (which is the default now), there is no need for the iptables rules. I have many site-to-site OpenVPN links set up this way (just through the GUI).</p><p>Regards,<br />Tim</p>									</div>

					<p>This is contrary to what I&#039;ve observed.&nbsp; I still need those custom rules.&nbsp; Maybe it&#039;s because my setup is too complicate.&nbsp; Will setup two plain vanilla virtual machines to verify this.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello thdyck, you are right.&nbsp; My problem is introduced by other rules.&nbsp; By using your configuration, those two networks can reach each other.</p>									</div>
