					<p>Hey all,&nbsp; I saw an openwrt page about opening up a Meraki MR26, but nothing about flashing it with openwrt.&nbsp; I have a few MR26&#039;s, would be willing to part with one if you can help me get them flashed :-)</p><p>Also have a few MR34&#039;s, same scenario as above... :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello, did you have any luck with this? I&#039;ve got a few MR26&#039;s but I can&#039;t see any firmware that would work with them. I&#039;ve got the serial cable linked to my machine so I can get as far as the busybox console but thats it. Could anyone help at all?</p>									</div>

					<p>I have an unloved MR26, and at the risk of reviving this thread I&#039;d like to comment that it&#039;s a broadcom device, and so I doubt it will be supported any time soon due to the lessons that bcom learned with the WRT54G. I have the MR16 flashed in 5 minutes, but see almost no information on the MR26. I also have an MS220 which would be an amazing switch if it were hackable. I suppose they are paper weights for the time being.</p>									</div>
