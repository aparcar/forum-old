					<p>Hello all.</p><p>I want to reduce or eliminate lag when gaming thru QoS. My internet speed is 3Mbps down / 1Mbps up and the game uses no more than 100Kbps down and 50Kbps up. I&#039;m considering getting a cheap router - something like the TL-WR841ND - and install openwrt on it. Will this kind of setup be of any good?</p>									</div>

					<p>QoS needs a relatively fast router to keep up with your line speed. Unless your WAN speed is very low, you will require something significantly faster than the tl-wr841.</p>									</div>

					<p>It will work for you bro, I was running a firmware on my TP-LINK 940N V4 (Same RAM and Flash as 841N) with SQM-Scripts (extra scripts included), LUCI and uPnP without any problem, it was working perfect. I just recommend to compile yourself a image via image builder, because on a trunk image for a tiny flash router it&#039;s so hard to download additional packages.</p>									</div>
