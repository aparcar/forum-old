					<p>Hi,</p><p>New here. New to OpenWRT altogether. A total noob.<br />I went to download the image to install on my router. There are two directories, generic and smp. Both contain an image with my router&#039;s model number. So, which do I choose? What&#039;s the difference between smp and generic?</p><p>Also, how&#039;s the GUI web interface? Is it good enough for a noob to rely on?</p><br /><p>Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pwd</strong> on 23 Dec 2016, 23:04)</p>

					<p>Which model number?</p><p>SMP probably means built to use all the cores on your router&#039;s multi-core CPU, while generic lacks the multi-core support -- it will run on only one core and leave the other(s) idle.&nbsp; Until recently almost all router hardware was single-core in the first place.</p>									</div>

But I see builds exactly for this model in all newer version, including the latest. Is the info simply not updated or is there a reason why it says v10.0.3?</p>									</div>
