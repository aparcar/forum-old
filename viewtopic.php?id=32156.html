					<p>The European Commission, in collaboration with broadband performance<br/>testing specialist SamKnows, has launched a pan-European project to<br/>map the broadband performance of all EU Member States. This follows<br/>successful projects run with Ofcom (the UK telecoms regulator) and the<br/>FCC (the US regulator). 10,000 volunteers are being sought from across <br/>Europe to participate in this new study.</p><p>SamKnows provides each volunteer with a free &#039;whitebox&#039;, a hardware<br/>device designed to measure the performance of the volunteer&#039;s Internet<br/>connection when it is not being used. Hardware is provided through a<br/>partnership with TP-Link and, of course, the devices utilise OpenWrt<br/>as their operating system.</p><p>Sam Crawford from SamKnows stated: &quot;OpenWrt coupled with TP-Link<br/>hardware is a dream come true - it&#039;s reliable, cost effective and<br/>incredibly easy to work with. We&#039;re big fans of the OpenWrt project<br/>and have been using it in deployments since 2008. We contribute back<br/>to the project too, by providing pre-release hardware samples, writing<br/>wiki documents and assisting others on the forums.&quot;</p><p>If you would like to learn more about the project or register as a<br/>volunteer please visit <a href="http://www.samknows.eu/">http://www.samknows.eu</a>.</p>									</div>

					<p>2 years of program&nbsp; duration? I think its too long.<br/>If you cancel it before the 2 years, they say you should give back the device, and they will pay the returning shipping.<br/>And if you finish the 2 years study, then you got a free router <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile"/> Nice part.</p>									</div>
