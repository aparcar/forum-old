					<p>Hello,<br />although I am not familiar with cross compiling I setup a OpenWRT build environment and tried for a couple of days to cross compile the open-vm-modules or the vmware modules vmxnet3, vmmemctl, vmsync, vmci and so on.<br />But I was not successful until now :-(<br />Only the source for vmxnet3 which is coming along with the kernel sources did compile, but caused a kernel panic after inserting the module. Compiling from open-vm or vmware sources always resulted in compile errors I can not help myself with.</p><p>Thus my question:<br />Did someone of you out there successfully manage to build the open-vm-modules? ...and perhaps can provide them to me?</p><p>It would be great to at least get the ready compiled vmxnet3 and the vmmemctl modules in order to reduce used ressources in my VM and be able to use vmxnet3 network adapter instead of e1000.</p><p>Many thanks in advance for your replies.</p><p>By the way...<br />OpenWRT runs great inside a VM on VMware ESXi and is the best IPv6 capable firewallI know!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Bish,<br />for Backfire it&#039;s the same as with WhiteRussian as stated in the existing HowTo. The only difference ist to download a Backfire .vmdk file instead:<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/x86_generic/openwrt-x86-generic-combined-ext2.vmdk">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 â€¦ -ext2.vmdk</a></p>									</div>
