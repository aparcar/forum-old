					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have some problems with 3 new WRT54GL which I bought some days ago. All of them seems to have much lower TX power than WRT54G and some older GLs... On links between different nodes with identical settings (wl0_txpwr=20, wl0_gmode=4,...) and identical antennas I get weird results from OLSR<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>like this
Local: new WRT54GL/rc5   Remote: WRT54Gv3.0/rc5   LQ: 0.99   NLQ: 0.67
Local: new WRT54GL/rc5   Remote: WRT54Gv2.2/rc2   LQ: 0.91   NLQ: 0.10

or this
Local: new WRT54GL/rc5   Remote: old WRT54GL/pre-rc5   LQ: 1.00   NLQ: 0.79
Local: new WRT54GL/rc5   Remote: WRT54Gv2.2/rc2        LQ: 0.60   NLQ: 0.10
Local: new WRT54GL/rc5   Remote: WRT54Gv2.2/pre-rc5    LQ: 0.99   NLQ: 0.61

when it should be something like this
Local: old WRT54GL/pre-rc5   Remote: WRT54Gv2.2/pre-rc5    LQ: 0.92   NLQ: 0.96
Local: old WRT54GL/pre-rc5   Remote: WRT54Gv2.0/rc2        LQ: 0.99   NLQ: 0.97</code></pre></div><p>I also noticed that &#039;wl curpower&#039; shows different output on G and GL nodes with identical settings:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>WRT54G:

					<p>Perhaps the situation is the reverse and txpwr was not working before as it should have, and now is. It takes its setting in mW, so if you set it to just 20 (which is sort of maximum if it had been dBm) you don&#039;t get the maximum that&#039;s possible, which is appr. 80 mW. If you don&#039;t set this variable at all the power will be set to the maximum by default. So anything is better than setting it to 20.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, 20mW is right. In europe only 20dBm EIRP TX power is allowed, and because I have 12dBi antennas I set the txpwr on my G/GL routers to 20mW (13dBm). With cable loss it is then approx. 20dBm total <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/roll.png" width="15" height="15" alt="roll" /></p>									</div>
