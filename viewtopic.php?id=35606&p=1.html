					<p>Hello all, </p><p>I have ability to upload openWRT to BT HomeHub 3 version A (ARX186), but when I start openWRT it is braked on initialization of ttyLQT0-1. After initialization of UART and switching from eraly0 to ttyLQT0-1 it is show noise on the serial port. Do you have any ideas of right IRQs for UART initialization on Lantiq ARX168&nbsp; processor ?</p><br /><br /><p>thank you.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Tormal</strong> on 8 May 2012, 16:44)</p>

					<p>I have tried add support of BT Home Hub 3 version A to openWRT. I have modified uboot-lantiq package to add compilation u-boot.asc for that router with nand memory and able upload via com port to that router. After that I can upload openwrt image via tftp and tried to start. But I have some problems with kernel:</p><p>I still have problem described above, but I am avoid it but kernel command line: bootargs=keep_bootcon ignore_loglevel. </p><p>Currently I have another problem with init process start up. Kernel entering into free_initmem which execute platform depended code. And under that code kernel have a hangs. I have modified that routine to print memory addresses: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>void free_init_pages(const char *what, unsigned long begin, unsigned long end)
{
&lt;------&gt;unsigned long pfn;
&lt;------&gt;

&lt;------&gt;
&lt;------&gt;for (pfn = PFN_UP(begin); pfn &lt; PFN_DOWN(end); pfn++) {

					<p>Heh, thanks Tormal.</p><p>When I got back to looking at it, the UART ports on the two Hubs I was playing with had died :-(&nbsp; Completely dead.&nbsp; However, both boards&nbsp; still boot okay, so it looks like it&#039;s only the UART ports.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hmm.. it&#039;s a surprise because I used a reliable PL2303 USB-UART bridge.

					<p>As I remember, that converter support two modes 5 and 3.3. Please be sure that you use 3.3 V mode. </p><p>Also on my converter I have problem with using serial port if I install cable in computer while router is off. <br />So may be this help for you: </p><p>1.

					<p>@j8soot: my experience is: the smaller it gets, the more generous I have to be with the flux. This way I&#039;ve been soldering already some smd chips (down to tssop packages) with a regular 15 or 20 W soldering iron.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks MBS.</p><p>For now I tried with an old HH2.0B and I successfully soldered the serial wires (the solder pads are big so it was easy to do) and now I have it running OpenWRT.</p><p>I only know the basics of soldering and while it works I probably don&#039;t do it the best way. I have looked for videos showing how to solder onto tiny pads like is required to add the serial wires to the HH3.0A but I haven&#039;t been able to find any yet. I will need to practice on tiny pads first but I also must buy more solder and a couple of other things so will do that soon.</p><p>Because I only know the basics I would appreciate a list of tools and materials used and a brief step by step list of what to do to attach a wire to a tiny pad using flux and solder.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m using some flux gel, that&#039;s very easy to apply. When soldering wires to pads, remove 0,5-1,0 mm of the isolation of the wire, apply some flux on that wire end and heat it up on the solder iron with a bit of solder added until it turns silver. Then put some flux on the pad, a bit solder on the tip of your solder iron, hold the wire on the pad and press with the tip of the solder iron on it for 2-3 seconds.<br />Just don&#039;t get too much solder on your tip (a thin film is fine, but no drops) and use plenty of flux.</p>									</div>

					<p>I finally received everything and have soldered the serial and it is working.</p><p>I used kapton tape to align the wires and with a small magnifying glass I soldered the wires to the pads. I still don&#039;t think I managed it like a soldering pro and the wires I used weren&#039;t as small as I probably should have used but I did take my time and was careful. At first I attempted to solder to the pad next to the white component but I think it was impossible because it did not have solder on it so I tried the pad above which did have solder on it and it worked.</p><p>The flux gel was a big part of my success so thanks again MBS!</p><p>Also for me the pad above R21 is RX and the pad above R39 is TX which is the opposite of what is labelled in the picture.</p><p>To backup the flash before installing OpenWRT:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>1. Gain SSH access
2. Do the command &#039;system shell&#039;

# dd if=/dev/mtdblock0 of=/mnt/&lt;path&gt;/mtdblock0.bin</code></pre></div><p>For me the path is fs/B and when I do the above:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/ # dd if=/dev/mtdblock0 of=/mnt/fs/B/mtdblock0.bin
65536+0 records in
65536+0 records out
