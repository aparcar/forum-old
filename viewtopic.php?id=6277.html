					<p>I just ripped my BEFW11S4 from some time in 03&#039; apart and checked the chips out.&nbsp; It has an 8MB flash (29lv800btc) and 2 x 16 mbit ram (em636165ts).&nbsp; Has anyone researched the possibility of putting openwrt onto this device?&nbsp; I&#039;m a noob but it apears to be a wrt54g without the 802.11g ability only 802.11b.&nbsp; Any information on this device&#039;s capabilities would be greatly appretiated.</p><p>Thanks-</p>									</div>

					<p>Would it be possible for someone (like myself eventually) to make a 1 meg flash that has ONLY client mode capability or does client mode its self take more than 1 meg?&nbsp; I would like to help the project in any way I can thanks for correcting my idiot error with bits and bytes.&nbsp; I guess i figured they would have to use more memory for the older models since they had not spent as much time developing the firmware to trim it down.</p><p>I find client mode on my WRT54G to be most usefull.</p>									</div>

					<p>It may be possible, but very very difficult. It only has 1MiB of flash and 4MiB of memory. That&#039;s not much to work with. The Linux kernel itself will take up about half the flash, and aproximately 1.3MiB of memory once it&#039;s loaded. You&#039;re better off getting a WRT54G (even a version 5 or 6). At least those can run OpenWRT without modifications.</p>									</div>
