					<p>Hey,</p><p>I posted this to the openswan-users list, and I&#039;m reiterating it here.</p><p>On popular request I did some throughput tests using a Linksys WRT54G broadband router as ipsec endpoint. </p><p>0) General </p><p>The tests are performed with iperf for throughput, and cyclesoak on the WRT54G for CPU load. Cyclesoak is recalibrated for each new algorithm, but not between tests. </p><p>- Each test is peformed five times. <br />- For the CPU load, 11 data points are taken (1/second, for 10 seconds). For the CPU load the average is taken over 9 of these (the minimum and maximum values are taken out). <br />- The throughput yields one (total) value per test. </p><p>To get to the totals the 5 data points for CPU load and throughput are averaged over 3 measurements. As before, the minimum and maximum values are taken out. </p><p>1) Test results </p><p>1.1) Switching (same subnet) </p><p>Network layout: </p><p>eth0/10.164.10.200 --- (br0/10.164.10.1) --- eth0/10.164.10.100 <br />iperf -s --- (&nbsp; &nbsp;cyclesoak&nbsp; &nbsp;) --- iperf -N -c 10.164.10.200 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Average CPU load:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; N/A&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; % <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Average throughput:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 93.8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mbit/s </p><p>1.2) Routing (different subnets) </p><p>Network layout: </p><p>eth0/192.168.1.200 --- (br0:1/192.168.1.1 X br0/10.164.10.1) --- eth0/10.164.10.100 <br />iperf -s --- (&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;cyclesoak&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;) --- iperf -N -c 192.168.1.200 </p><br /><p>1.2.1) Without IPsec <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Average CPU load:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 52.9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; % <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Average throughput:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 26.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mbit/s </p><p>1.2.2) With IPsec </p><p>The ipsec tunnel is between 192.168.1.200 (left) and 10.164.10.1 (right), with 10.164.10.0/24 as rightsubnet.

Shame, but when I get a chance I will rerun these tests, but with NULL taken into the results too. </p><p>I think the general conclusion can be drawn that indeed AES is better to use for IPsec on resource starved devices. I don&#039;t think that comes as a <br />surprise to anyone :-) I am amazed by the large amount of load which simple routing puts on the CPU though, especially as simple switching didn&#039;t have any measurable effect on the CPU load (I guess that&#039;s done purely in hardware). Imagine how much throughput you&#039;d be able to get when that area is optimized. Admittedly though, I didn&#039;t disable the <br />iptables ruleset when I preformed these tests. Maybe I should have. When I rerun the tests with NULL encryption for IPsec, I&#039;ll be sure to also <br />not have any netfilter in the way too. If in the meantime anyone has any suggestions on better tests or test methods, please let me know, and I&#039;ll take your suggestions into account on the next test run. </p><p>PS: I don&#039;t know how the layout of this piece will come over in your mail client, and the ascii art might not look that good either. Use your imagination :-)</p>									</div>

In my case, not very useful. Building iperf for openwrt shouldn&#039;t be much of a problem, see the Wiki on how to build packages, and browse around in this forum on how to do it.</p>									</div>
