					<p>AFAIC, basically the more Flash/RAM, the better the router is to run any (open-source) firmware. Some routers come with built-in USB port(s) and this will be a plus.</p>									</div>

					<p>if you mean what hardware is supported best, then that would depend, do you mean on White Russian, or Kamikaze?&nbsp; What are your goals for the device?&nbsp; On White Russian the Broadcom based routers tend to be better supported than the others (arm, x86 and other obscure arch&#039;s)&nbsp; For Kamikaze the Broadcom still tend to be a good bet, though the wireless for the 2.6 broadcom is unreliable (unless this has recently changed)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>22bsti</strong> on 4 Jan 2008, 00:04)</p>

					<p>Hi I&#039;m new to the forums as well, I&#039;m selling my WRT54GS (6.0) Don&#039;t get this version! &amp; going to buy either the WRT54Gl (1.1) or a refurbished&nbsp; WRT54GS (1.0) i think both are a good start better than my first choice (6.0)</p><p>I want to use mine for a wireless sniffer to look for free hotspots. Should I go for the refurbished&nbsp; WRT54GS (1.0) as it has more mermory? or will the WRT54Gl (1.1) be fine?</p>									</div>

					<p>Those Buffalo wifi routers are a good value. I have two WHRHPG54&#039;s overclocked to 250MHz, tx power at OpenWrt&#039;s default 19dBm, and SD modded. One of them was bought to replace a WRT54GL. The GL is now a backup.</p>									</div>
