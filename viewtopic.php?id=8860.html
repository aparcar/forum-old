					<p>is it possible that some routers support jtag over ethernet?<br />for SOC chips where the chip has ethernet controller, it might support jtag over ethernet, by sending special packets over the ethernet port.</p><p>what makes me assume this is that some routers has a recovery tool that is able to access the router over ethernet and update the flash while the serial console option to control is not reached and no log generated about flashing the memory.</p><p>I have a dg834g with currupt bootloader configuration area, the bootloader log to the console its starting, and then hangs, I managed to update the firmware using the recovery tool from netgear.</p>									</div>

					<p>The routers boot in stages, first booting to a bootloader like CFE and then booting into the firmware. CFE allows you to reflash via tftp, other bootloaders have similar mechanisms to reflash. In other words, even if the firmware doesn&#039;t boot, you can still boot enough to recover without jtag.</p><p>If you manage to screw up or crash CFE, you will need a jtag cable. There is no jtag over ethernet; inventing terminology for concepts not understood does not make it correct.</p>									</div>
