					<p>Hy all,</p><p>today i have installed the OpenWRT Backfire 10.03.1 Firmware on my TPLINK TL-WR1043ND. This is the first time i use OpenWRT so i do have problems with installation, especially with using WAN over PPTP.</p><p>Till now i found out that i have to install some packages to use PPTP.</p><p>So the packages are the following:</p><p><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/brcm-2.4/packages/kmod-gre_2.4.37.9-1_brcm-2.4.ipk">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … cm-2.4.ipk</a> <br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/brcm-2.4/packages/resolveip_1_brcm-2.4.ipk">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … cm-2.4.ipk</a> <br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/brcm-2.4/packages/pptp_1.7.1-4_brcm-2.4.ipk">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … cm-2.4.ipk</a></p><p>So i saved this files via WinSCP on my router in the &quot;tmp&quot; folder. Then i wanted to install them over the putty with the following commands:</p><p>root@OpenWrt:~# opkg install /tmp/kmod-gre*.ipk<br />root@OpenWrt:~# opkg install /tmp/resolveip*.ipk<br />root@OpenWrt:~# opkg install /tmp/pptp*.ipk<br />root@OpenWrt:~# rm /tmp/*.ipk</p><p>When i use the install command from above i get this message:</p><p> * wfopen: /tmp/kmod-gre*.ipk: No such file or directory.<br /> * pkg_init_from_file: Failed to extract control file from /tmp/kmod-gre*.ipk.</p><p>Maybe the problem is that my files do not have a .ipk ending. They have a .gz ending</p><p>Sorry but these things are very new to me so i need some help i think.</p><p>Thanks!!</p><p>Greets</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello wr1043nd,</p><p>Are you really using a Tp-Link TL-WR1043ND? Its target is ar7xxx and not brcm-2.4 as the URLs you posted.<br />Download the correct files and try again. Also, check if the wanted packages are not already installed with:</p><p> opkg list | grep pptp</p><p>Change pptp to whatever you need.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello wr1043nd,</p><p>if kmod-gre_2.6.32.27-1_ar71xx.ipk existed in /tmp, Shell (ash) should expand /tmp/kmod-gre*.ipk to /tmp/kmod-gre_2.6.32.27-1_ar71xx.ipk before passing to opkg.<br />As opkg reports that it could not find /tmp/kmod-gre*.ipk, probability it does not exists.</p><p>Double check its location and existence or just use &quot;tab&quot; to complete the path with no chance of error.</p><p>I installed local package files multiple times and, trust me, it works.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t think that i have downloaded the wrong files this time...</p><p>I have used the same link as you &gt;&gt; this one</p><p><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/ar71xx/packages/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … /packages/</a></p><p>but when i click on this file kmod-gre_2.6.32.27-1_ar71xx.ipk the download appears but the file has not .ipk ending. It has .gz ending kmod-gre_2.6.32.27-1_ar71xx.gz. Maybe you could try it.</p><p>I have dual boot system with win7 and ubuntu, so i have the possibility to install it via linux. </p><p>Let me guess: Next question will be, why i didn&#039;t try it with ubuntu till now... </p><br /><br /><p>Thanks for your patience.</p>									</div>

					<p>You got it! :-) Do it in Linux.</p><p>The .gz was added by, possibily, your browser. <br />The ipk files are a tar.gz file that contains other files. that&#039;s why the .gz extension.<br />Of couse, if this is the case, just rename it back to original name.</p>									</div>

I&#039;m very lucky :-)</p><p>This is a great forum! Maybe i have new questions in the next days.. we will see</p>									</div>
