					<p>Sorry if my questions have been already answered but I&#039;m a bit confused about the installation process and the status of this hack. I&#039;ve the HooToo HT-TM02 but I never turned it on! I don&#039;t have a lot of spare time to play with it... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>1) wingspinner&#039;s firmware replace the original bootloader. However I&#039;ve read in the last posts that it&#039;s not needed anymore to install CC. It&#039;s true?</p><p>2) With the original bootloader is possible to boot openwrt and original firmware?</p><p>3) I&#039;ve opened the wingspinner&#039;s firmware and it&#039;s a linux script+firmware in one single file. The script is very simple and it&#039;s very well explained (thanks a lot wingspinner). I wonder why no one edited that script to do all the whished things. There are some CRC problems? <br />For example: to keep the original bootloader in the usb you have to replace line 141 (&quot;rm -f $FIRMFILE&quot;) with this: &quot;#rm -f $FIRMFILE&quot; (Warning: if you decrease the lines of the script, you have to change also the variable &quot;SKIP&quot; in the script or you will probably brick)<br />However if there are not any CRC or MD5 checks on the firmware, I think to be able to create a script that create a back up of the original firmware with the partitions already merged.</p><p>4) I never understood the exact procedure to restore the original firmware. I saw there is a procedure involving the serial cable and tftp. I can revert to the original firmware also via ethernet without serial? If yes, there is a guide?</p><p>5) I don&#039;t know very well how the openwrt update process work, but I think that via CLI we can use the command:<br />&quot;mtd -r write ORIGINAL_FIRMWARE firmware&quot; where ORIGINAL_FIRMWARE is mtd4+mtd5, to restore original firmware. I&#039;m wrong?</p><p>Thanks anyone would answer my questions <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> I want to try help this project! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>P.s. sorry for any error in my message, I&#039;m not english.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>numero53</strong> on 14 Oct 2015, 23:10)</p>

					<p>Well, progress has been made. Going back through Serial data stream I noticed some checksum errors when using menu-2 and the OpenWrt Firmware.bin with the TFTP transfer.</p><p>So, in defiance of Einstein&#039;s Law, I kept retrying the process and finally got a full TFTP download. Then it happily processed it.</p><p>Sadly the same cannot be said of Menu-2 and the factory.bin firmware. I could never get it to go beyond &quot;Login&quot; and &quot;Password&quot; no matter what I tried.</p><p>So, for me the process was.<br />Turn off the router power.<br />Copy &quot;mtd3_firmware.bin&quot; to the TFTP base Folder<br />Rename it &quot;kernal.bin&quot; the name doesn&#039;t really matter at this stage. Capital letters will later though, so remember exactly what you named it.<br />Hook up the serial wires and Run puTTY in Serial 57600 with No-flow and No-Parity.<br />Go into the Network and Sharing center and set the Local IP address to 10.10.10.3<br />Click in the Subnet Mask section and it should fill it in with 255.0.0.0 and leave the rest empty.<br />Set the TFTP server to the correct folder for the renamed &quot;kernel.bin&quot;<br />Plug in the RJ45 to the router and check that the TFTP has 10.10.10.3 showing in the second. If not -- drop down the box and select it from the list.<br />Click in the puTTY window and turn on the router.<br />You only get 4-seconds to make a selection at the menu so be ready wwith a finger over the &quot;2&quot; button<br />Tap it and get<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>You choosed 2</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; raspi_read: from 40028 len:6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2: System Load Linux to Flash via TFTP.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Please Input new ones /or Ctrl-C to discard<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Input device IP (10.10.10.123) ==:10.10.10.123</p></blockquote></div><p>It doesn&#039;t look like it but that last line is a question so just tap &quot;Enter&quot; to accept.<br />The next line is similar for the Server IP so tap &quot;Enter&quot;<br />Then it will show you a file name, so Backspace it out and type in whatever you renamed the file to before. Take note of capitals. C++ cares. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Now, watch it all go by.</p><p>If no checksum errors you will get to a point where it looks like it has hung with the last line being something like &quot;Going into Port Forwarding mode&quot; there will be three lines like that then the cursor in a blank line.<br />You are actually now running in OpenWrt but no telling you, so tap &quot;Enter&quot; and mix a drink.<br />You can now shut puTTY and TFTP down.<br />Go back to the Ntwork and sharing center and change the local IP to 192.168.1.2<br />Subnet mask will fill itself in.<br />For gateway enter 192.168.1.1<br />Fill in the DNS servers if you have favorites that do not log your every request.<br />Use your browser to access LuCI with 192.168.1.1</p><p>A big thank-you for everyone&#039;s help.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>HooTooBeatMe</strong> on 15 Oct 2015, 01:00)</p>

					<p>Cool.&nbsp; In my experience I was never able to get factory firmware back on the TM02 after the bootloader was replaced by OpenWRT.&nbsp; I was able to run OpenWRT with the factory bootloader though, go figure.&nbsp; Can you update the bootloader via the serial console?&nbsp; If you can then it should be no problem to get the router back to factory firmware.</p><p>If your bootloader was factory the IPs for tftp would be different.&nbsp; That&#039;s as least one way to tell.</p>									</div>

					<p>@HooTooBeatMe,<br />Did you try using the default subnet that HooToo uses, I think the router defaults to 10.10.10.254 on factory firmware and it should be accessible from both WLAN and WAN, a &quot;little&quot; glitch of theirs.</p><p>Also, did you try a reset to factory (pinhole) after the kernel loaded?&nbsp; Just to see if that makes a difference.</p><p>Out of the box admin doesn&#039;t have a password but root is set to 20080826.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if you tried that one.</p>									</div>
