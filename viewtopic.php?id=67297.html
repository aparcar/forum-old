					<p>If you want to use a proxy in browser, you need to install a proxy application, port forward works only as a dumb port forward, it is not a proxy. Proxy needs a bit of intelligence, because it needs to accepts commands like http connect etc.</p>									</div>

You need a http proxy server (in transparent mode) running in 3128 port to make that rule work. OpenWRT support several http proxys easily, like squid.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>MikeZak wrote:</cite><blockquote><div class="quotebox"><cite>eduperez wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I think we need more information about what are you trying to accomplish with this.</p></blockquote></div><p>I am trying to port forward because I need internet connection on another port</p></blockquote></div><p>If the problem is that your internet connection block port 80 outgoing connections then you need run the http proxy in a internet server, out of the router. You can&#039;t use another port for http internet connections without a external http proxy server.</p>									</div>
