					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m using a shell script that repeatedly creates and removes temporary files in /tmp (quite a lot actually). When I look at the disc usage using du I see normal values, but df shows that there is quite a log of space missing.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>~# du -h -d1
0       ./dropbear-b36f09fa
76.0k   ./wdbb
0       ./spool
0       ./log
20.0k   ./run
124.0k  .</code></pre></div><div class="codebox"><pre><code>~# df -h
Filesystem                Size      Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/root               832.0k    832.0k         0 100% /rom
none                     14.9M      1.3M     13.6M   9% /tmp

/jffs                   832.0k    832.0k         0 100% /</code></pre></div><p>This used to mean I had to reboot the box once a day. After I changed the scripts to write less files less often, I think I can now get it to run for several days, but it&#039;s still annoying. </p><p>I&#039;ve also heard reports of people having their boxes mysteriously lock up after several weeks/months, maybe this is why.</p><p>Any ideas anyone?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Jannes</strong> on 22 Jul 2006, 11:56)</p>
