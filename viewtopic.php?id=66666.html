					<p>Hello, </p><p>I&#039;m trying to get any type of IPv6 number on my OpenWRT repeater bridge, but so far I&#039;ve had no joy. </p><p>I&#039;m using a 6to4 HE tunnel. It works fine on the main router, and there are two clients (Lubuntu and ChromeOS) which gladly accept the IPv6 numbers given by the main router. </p><p>The OpenWRT repeater bridge is connected to the main router by 5 GHz and that&#039;s working very well. The IPv4 ip is 192.168.1.5. </p><p>I&#039;ve tried both static and dynamic IPv6 ip -- nothing has worked. This is in my /etc/config/network, it&#039;s the latest thing I&#039;ve tried -- and no, it&#039;s not working. </p><p>config interface &#039;lan6&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;option proto &#039;dhcpv6&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;option ifname &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;option reqprefix no </p><p>ta, m.</p>									</div>

					<p>You don&#039;t really mention how you set up your &quot;OpenWRT repeater bridge&quot;, but if you&#039;re using a relayd pseudo-bridge, it&#039;s not going to work (no igmpproxy for IPv6, recent attempts to get an equivalent for IPv6 merged into netdev failed; IPv6 relies heavily on working IGMP support, without it, it won&#039;t work). MAC80211 based WDS (4addr) however does transparently support IPv6, but effectively requires the same router firmware (well, mainline mac80211 drivers and a firmware supporting 4addr, in contrast to using weird vendor drivers) on both routers.</p>									</div>

					<p>Homenet is designed to solve these problems without a lot of configuration. OpenWrt has a package - hnet-full - that implements the Homenet protocols.</p><p>The <a href="http://homewrt.org">http://homewrt.org</a> site provides links to various resources. I just created a howto for installing it and it worked to the limit of my testing (although I did not play with 6in4). The guide is at: <a href="http://www.homewrt.org/doku.php?id=hnet-lede">http://www.homewrt.org/doku.php?id=hnet-lede</a> - I tested it on LEDE (a fork of OpenWrt), but it should work for OpenWrt as well.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>richbhanover</strong> on 8 Aug 2016, 23:00)</p>
