					<p>Greetings,</p><p>This is an odd request, but i work with an individual that has been in contact with someone who has ported various cisco features to zebra, including the ability to create vpn&#039;s.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to help beta-test that code, and experiment as it woudl be cheaper for me to update and hack a wrt54g than to go out and buy a 2611 and have the tunnel ios installed on it.</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>									</div>
