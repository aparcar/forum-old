					<p>Hi All</p><p>I&#039;m working on a project to create a micro wifi hotstpot based on one of portable wireless repeaters Tp link WR 700 N Tenda A5, Winstar WS-WN523N2 and many others available in the market.</p><p>My questions are:</p><p>1. Are their any devices (like above) that are Open-wrt compatible ? I&#039;ve looked up the router database but can&#039;t find any.</p><p>2. Are there any guys on this forum who are willing to take up the challenge of simple GUI mods and setting defaults if devices are not dd-wrt compatible? Paid work is possible.</p><p>3. Lastly, Which platform is best for this application ? Ralink, Atheros or Broadcom ?</p><p>Many thanks for taking up the challenge!</p>									</div>

					<p>3. Ralink doesn&#039;t support repeater mode. Broadcom doesn&#039;t support repeater mode, only the binary driver does. Atheros will do.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks Nilfred</p><p>Can you elaborate on that</p><p>I&#039;ve tested EDUP 2906 aand Tenda 5 and Tenda 6 and all 3 worked successfully in repeater mode. I opened the devices and they are based on Ralink RT5350 chip.</p><p>Your thoughts?</p>									</div>
