					<p>Hi,</p><p>It just occured to me that there might be a possible for supporting multi-radio multi-channel support in the OpenWRT platform. Many mesh-networking companies typically tout multi-radio/multi-channel support. </p><p>Here is a possible method by which three Linksys routers can be combined to support multi-radio multi-channel. </p><p>Methodology:<br />1. Hardware<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Put the three linksys (could be any other device) routers in Bridge mode. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - The three routers are physically connected via the ethernet LAN ports <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Lets call these routers LS1, LS2 and LS3.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - I have tested the bridge-mode connection and works quite well<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Essentially provides a very wide Layer2 connection<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - These three linksys routers can be stacked on top of each other essentially providing 3 radios (you could use 2 for 2 radios)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - This will how a Node-group will look like <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; / &lt;-- Radio1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Node1a<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &lt;----------- Wired link<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\&nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp;/&nbsp; &lt;-- Radio2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Node1b<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &lt;----------- Wired link<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\&nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp;/&nbsp; &lt;-- Radio3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Node1c</p><p>2. Software<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - This is the secret-sauce that needs to be developed. The goal is:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Launch it in each of the routers LS1, LS2, LS3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Communicate among each other to know they are part of the same bridge<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Have a channel allocation scheme for each router so they do not mutually interfere with each other.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - This needs to be a modular and scalable architecture so that nodes can be added to the stack in an on-demand basis.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - The secret sauce could be developed either as a plugin for OLSR or for the spanning-tree-protocol implementation.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - The STP implementation would mean that its one big layer-2 wireless network with the node-groups forming some kind of non-loop network<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - OLSR-plugin would obviously mean that all node-groups act as olsr-routers with intelligent channel assignment schemes.</p><p>3.

					<p>Talked to one of the researchers working on TIC. The split-router architecture software is to be released soon and GPLd. It will be good to know how the above problem can be potentially solved by it. Stay tuned!</p><p>Meanwhile it will be good to know if others have thought of a similar problem and if they have any comments and suggestions.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Rajesh.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Researchers from UCSB have just released a MCMR architecture. It looks quite solid and based on the research work they have been doing the last few years. Here is the site:<br /><a href="http://moment.cs.ucsb.edu/tic">http://moment.cs.ucsb.edu/tic</a>&nbsp; .</p><p>I shall be reposting this under a diffenert thread as well.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Rajesh.</p>									</div>
