					<p>Hi I&#039;m using the firmware openwrt RC5 on my Asus wl-500g and I changed the minipci wlancard to an Atheros AR5213 XR Chip (AR5004X).<br />I installed madwifi driver und olsrd on my AP. Now my olsrd shows me that other ap&#039;s can send data to me, but my AP isn&#039;t able to send data to the other AP&#039;s.<br />Now I thinks thats because of the old Version of the madwifi driver.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>kmod-madwifi - 2.4.30brcm+r1208-20060106-1 - Driver for Atheros 802.11a/b/g Mini

					<p>Hmm, RC5 is very old and obsolete. Even if you compile (a newer one from subversion) your own WR firmware I would not upgrade the madwifi drivers in WR (it&#039;s waste of time).</p><p>If you don&#039;t need the webif GUI I&#039;d recommend you to switch over to a self compiled Kamikaze firmware (brcm-2.6, Kernel 2.6 because you&#039;re using a Atheros WiFi card). As you already said, Kamikaze has the newest madwifi driver.</p><p>Kamikaze is the future <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>forum2006</strong> on 9 Jan 2007, 23:13)</p>

					<p>Yes I know that but we have here about 190 Ap&#039;s that a runnig with the RC5, all of them have a spezial ipkg packet that we need. I can&#039;t use this packet in kamikaze than I have to rewrite the scripts myselve for kamikaze and that would take a lot of time. <br />We have to rewrite those sripts anyway some day but kamikaze is now not stabel anoth to do that. I also read that it will someday completly rewritten. <br />So is it posibly to compile a new Version and how? I will experiment with kamikaze anyway but would prefere to use the old RC5.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Oconnor</strong> on 9 Jan 2007, 23:40)</p>

					<p>Ok, you have to update the Makefiles and patches (probably you can take some patches from Kamikaze, I don&#039;t know) in:</p><p> - whiterussian/openwrt/package/madwifi-tools and<br /> - whiterussian/openwrt/target/linux/package/madwifi</p><p>and than rebuild them...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>forum2006</strong> on 10 Jan 2007, 00:17)</p>
