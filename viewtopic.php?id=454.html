But you have to wonder, how safe is it to use a VPN protocol that hasn&#039;t seen much public (or private) research? Is it really worth the risk?</p><p>If you have some problem with IPsec, at least go and use OpenVPN instead of CIPE. Even though OpenVPN is also a non standard, not IETF tunnel mechanism, it at least uses TLS/SSL, which has seen a lot of public scrutiny like IPsec.</p><p>Another issue is the path mtu issue. You might run into lots of problems when to layers of IP start to fragment or drop packets, and ICMP&#039;s for path MTU discovery aren&#039;t reaching the right layer.</p><p>Olaf in his CIPE FAQ describes ciphers (AES, Blowfish, 3DES) and then says &#039;these are secure and so my protocol is secure&#039;. That&#039;s a rather misleading statement. Especially because he is mixinger ciphers with algorithms and protocols. He then mentions the existence of DoS vulnerabilities, and other &#039;theoretical&#039; vulnerabilities. </p><p>Frankly, IPsec and TLS/SSL are the two most widely used industry standards. They have been around for a long time, and are continiously shaken by the research community. I would not recommend to use CIPE protocol.</p><p>Paul<br />ps.diclaimer: I am an Openswan (IPsec) developer.</p>									</div>

					<p>openvpn is a very good package(easy to configure, a must especially for road warrior running XP) except that it depends on openssl which takes a whooping 1.5M flash space. </p><p>BTW, when can I see openwan 2.2 package for openwrt ?

					<p>I tried OpenVPN and&nbsp; got it up and running stable. So no issues with the package itself.</p><p>Unfortunately I had performance problems with NFS via OpenVPN. I had to reduce the size of NFS read/write buffer to get larger data transfer without blocking. With the smaller buffer size the performance was not great.</p><p>Using CIPE the NFS transfer worked with the larger default buffer size. That was the reason to use CIPE.</p><p>I use CIPE only for tunneling through a WLAN connetion. So the exposure to the public is limited.</p><p>Greetings,<br />Stefan</p>									</div>
