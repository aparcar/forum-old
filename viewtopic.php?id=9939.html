					<p>First, I do not know how much the OS can control the hardware to accomplish this feat, but I do know that it should be possible even if slow. Slow is fine as long as it is being done.</p><p>In terms of multipoint, we want to allow the router to manage an array of connections with several other nearby wireless routers and not just the up-link.&nbsp; Some hardware supports this in a way of a wireless bridge; however, we want to allow multiple networks (i.e. 10.0.1.x, 32.15.x.x, 135.30.20.x, etc) to be routed instead of a single network typical with a bridge.</p><p>Here the benefits:</p><p>Let say you have DSL customer A, B, and C. Now, A, B, and C want to network together because they within the same neighborhood. They thought about running a cable across the neighborhood, but that is not practical.&nbsp; They use DSL at the moment to achieve the task. So, the connection goes like A&lt;-&gt;DSL&lt;-&gt;B&lt;-&gt;DSL&lt;-&gt;C. It is kind of weird to have to use a strange DSL business to network local neighborhood traffic. Even that, the DSL connection only maxes out at 6Mbps when the DSL company is paid a top premium amount for the connection that could easily buy several new wireless routers in a year. A,B,and C want the 56Mbps+ speed that their router has and that the DSL company doesn&#039;t provide between each one. They want it to go A&lt;-WRT-&gt;B&lt;-WRT-&gt;C, instead. However, they also want to keep the DSL company connection for their private use. The DSL company doesn&#039;t allow its downward traffic to be bridged with neighbors (which is quite anti-internet), so A,B, and C want their routers to handle more than one network, wirelessly.</p><p>Actually, A, B, and C want D, E, F, and Joe, Harry, Frank, Sue, and their neighbors of neighbors and friends of friends to join in wirelessly, also.</p><p>Thank you!</p><p>Further edit: this could go beyond the normal mesh network and allow multichannel switching. I would assume the higher channels being used for shorter distances and quicker timeslices. However in the end, if 802.11s is supported sooner, this feature is not a demand.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dzonatas</strong> on 19 Mar 2007, 00:35)</p>
