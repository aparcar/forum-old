					<p>TuanND,</p><p>The wrt54g is doing routing when accessing the wan pppoe from lan. It takes packets from the 192.168.1.0 subnet to the wan interface. Your internet access provider has assigned to wan an IP address on another, provider proprietary, subnet.</p><p>The INPUT iptables chain is traversed when accessing the wrt54g itself and/or the other lan and/or the bridged wireless.</p><p>To influence the routing you should introduce commands in the FORWARD iptables chain, as the box itself does nothing with the packets but just forwards them to the wan net. <br />This explains why the INPUT chain command you issued does nothing in this case. The packets do not pass INPUT because the sending PC on the LAN has given the packets a destination address on the wan (internet). Iptables sees this and decides to FORWARD as the destination is clearly the internet and not the wrt box or a destination on the lan subnet.</p><p>rgds<br />doddel</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>doddel</strong> on 29 Sep 2005, 01:37)</p>

Or you can keep the -mac-source match-extention and remove the -s 192.168.1.100 option if you want to match to the MAC address only regardless of IP address (be carefull of this as it may stop all LAN to WAN traffic if the --mac-source extention isn&#039;t included in the iptable package installed on the router).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zaphod</strong> on 2 Oct 2005, 02:09)</p>
