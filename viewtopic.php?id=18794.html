					<p>Asus already produces the eee box, an Atom based desktop version with a 1GB of ram, a 160GB hard drive, 4 USB ports, an SD card reader, gigabit ethernet and 11n wireless. It sells for $300 right now, I wouldn&#039;t expect them to sell a device that is basically the same with reduced ram/storage (and a gigabit switch) for 60% of the cost.</p><p>They&#039;ve introduced enough eeePC (laptops) to dilute the line and confuse customers but they try to keep the prices comparable to each other. (Also, the various laptop models use different battery shapes, so your battery backup idea wouldn&#039;t work for all batteries.)</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I also recognized that netbook prices were really going down in the last few months.&nbsp; I am thining about getting the Asus Eee or the Lenovo <a href="http://www.netbooklaptopreviews.com/netbook-reviews/lenovo-ideapad-s10/">Ideapad</a> as additional netbooks. But the idea with the eee router seems very interesing, probably it&#039;s worth checking out. It could really revolutionize the market but I suppose not many people are aware of that option.</p>									</div>

					<p>Combined with a couple of gel cell or deep cycle <a href="http://www.etech.com/laptops-laptop-batteries--c1146_1162">Laptop Batteries</a>, it should have no problem recharging a laptop or running small appliances. Maybe even occasional microwave usage if you have enough battery storage and a large enough inverter. Just be sure to use the appropriate batteries (Gel Cell / AGC batteries if stored in the home. Regular Lead Acid Deep Cycle in a box outside, or in an box ventilated to the outside if inside the home).</p><p>If you do decide to go this route, find someone that REALLY knows what they are doing to assist you so that you don&#039;t over or under buy.</p><p>Ours charges a 60Ah gel cell and we have only used it for lights so far. Eventually I&#039;d like to add another battery or three and a inverter, but that&#039;s down the road.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>beauine</strong> on 31 Dec 2010, 07:58)</p>
