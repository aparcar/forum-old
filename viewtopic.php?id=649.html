					<p>Its probably my fault actually...What Ive done is I had upgraded my Linksys WRT54G unit to the newest firmware provided by linksys, and then without checking to see if WiFi was working I just straight up installed OpenWRT over it. I assume the WiFI settings got borked somewhere in there, and no I cant connect to it to save my life. The unit is sending out a signal, I can see it with netstumbler. Netstumbler also shows its is unprotected (no WEP) and is brodcasting the SSID. I had mac address filtering on and sucessfully working before I did all the upgrades and looking at the NVRAM output it appears to be setup still. When I try and connect to the unit via wifi with either my Linux or Windows installs they both just dont connect. No error messages or anything, just not able to ping anywhere through the wireless interface. Can someone post the relevant parts of their NVRAM so I can match it up and get it working? Im fine with no security on it (actually would prefer it) so I can just get it up, and from there I can add things as I need them. Thanks!</p><br /><p>Oh, quick neewbie question as well... When you run the &quot;nvram set&quot; command do the changes take effect immediatly, or does nvram commit need to be run first? Im kind of under the impression nvram commit is just so the settings are hardcoded once the unit reboots...but perhaps I&#039;m mislead? Thanks again.</p>									</div>

					<p>Do the clients associate with the ap?<br />Under linux you can test this by running iwconfig<br />if you are associated the Access point field will have the mac address of the AP.</p><p>You need to run nvram commit to make the changes stick over a reboot, since most of the settings are read by the scripts at boot time, simply changing the settings wont do much, you need to commit and reboot, or manually run the script that uses the settings.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, upon more investigation it seems if i manually up an IP on the wifi i can ping the router (192.168.1.1) but cannot ping anything past it, even other machines on my local network. It really seems to me that the MAC if my wifi card is blocked, but all the settings (As far as I can tell) in the nvram show no blocking is taking place.</p><p>Question....why are there settings for both wl and wl0 in the nvram? Two different sides of the wireless interface? Perhaps one of them is allowing me acces (so it responds to pings) but the oter side is rejecting me so I can&#039;t go out to the network anywhere. Also, why do the macmode settings have regular macmode and macmode1 for both wl and wl0 interfaces? Heres what I mean..</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>@OpenWrt:/# nvram show | grep -i macmode
wl0_macmode1=allow
wl_macmode=allow
wl0_macmode=allow

wl_macmode1=allow
filter_macmode=allow</code></pre></div><p>And just for fun my settings for maclist</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>@OpenWrt:/# nvram show | grep -i maclist
