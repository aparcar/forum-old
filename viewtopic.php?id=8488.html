					<p>Hallo<br />Sometimes you create your package on normal Linux System, where you are insure it will run. In few cases, cross compilation this program and install the package under router running OpenWRT will fail. <br />I want to ask if any debugger is available when this cases face the developer.</p><p>PS: I am sure that VM deals with different images, but creating an image for specific operating system is not easy.<br />For example, you can&#039;t create an image for Broadcom BCM963xx [2.4 or 2.4] but you create an image x86.</p>									</div>

					<p>You can use remote debugging with gdb I think, though I&#039;ve never needed it with OpenWrt myself so have yet to use it and can&#039;t give more details.</p>									</div>
