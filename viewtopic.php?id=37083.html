I&#039;ve seen that this router has a trunk version supported and if I understood it&#039;s like beta or RC. My question is which image should I choose to install. I surfed all the site and I&#039;ve found some download section. However I can&#039;t find my router name in the because it looks like they are listed for chipset names.</p><p>Mine is supposed to be Atheros but in the Atheros folder there are a lot of images and I don&#039;t want to random pick up something you know <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Could you please give me a link or instruction to know which is the right firmware image to download?</p><p>Is Lucy Web UI already in it?</p><p>Thank you guys I really appreciate your work!!!!</p>									</div>
