					<p>Hi</p><p>Anyone aware of an ability to send these routers into low power (standby) modes?</p><p>I&#039;m particularly interested if this is possible for the netgear wgt634u router... but it would be good to hear if anyone has tried this with other routers.</p><p>Ideally, would be great to find a mode that can be woken up, e.g. by wake-on-LAN (WOL) and also by interrupt (esp. GPIO interrupt, so I can wake it up on infra-red reception or RTC)</p><p>Regards</p><p>John</p>									</div>

					<p>AFAIK those devices do not support sleep modes. Think about a &quot;PowerManager circuit&quot;, like some kind of µC that communicates with the device via second serial port or USB and is able to power down/up your device. At least waking up your device via RTC (included in µC or attached via regular interface like I²C) will be possible then.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Tom</p><p>Thanks for your note, good idea...I guess if I run power over ethernet to the routers I want to power down then I can control that from a central location (I have 3 routers; one will probably be on all the time but the other two I use for music and as a baby monitor so they only really need to be up from time to time)</p><p>[nbd] sent me this link to the processor specification (used in many of these routers) which is sprinkled with reference to power management capabilities but I havent had a chance to really study it yet...</p><p><a href="http://www.voodoowarez.com/bcm5365p.pdf">http://www.voodoowarez.com/bcm5365p.pdf</a></p><p>there may be other things I can do to get power down like lower the clock speed and un-power the wireless card etc.</p><p>I&#039;ll post any results on this thread</p><p>John</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>johncass</strong> on 18 May 2007, 13:54)</p>
