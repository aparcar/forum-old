					<p>Hi all,</p><p>For those not familiar with NZBGet, it&#039;s a usenet/newsgroups downloader which can also run on OpenWrt. It&#039;s a nice power saving solution for those that not want to have their desktop running 24/7.</p><p>I know NZBGet is outdated in the repositories, but I managed to get it to work on Barrier Breaker and resolving all dependency problems one encounters using this outdated package. Here&#039;s the video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HItT02gLZJk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HItT02gLZJk</a></p><p>Btw, if someone could update the nzbget packages, or maybe cross compile the latest NZBGet for MIPS big endian, that&#039;d be awesome!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey Resilldoux,<br />I&#039;m working on documenting the Arduino Yun, and came to OpenWrt to see what I could find. I&#039;ve got a blog and a supporting website (for the programming I do). I&#039;m going to link to your YouTube list and the word out - as best as I can. You can email me at&nbsp; jesse 6 - 5 - 0 at gmail. </p><p>Or you can find me as&nbsp; (jessemonroy650) at <a href="http://forum.arduino.cc/">http://forum.arduino.cc/</a></p><p>Jesse<br />FYI: NO dashes in my email address.</p>									</div>
