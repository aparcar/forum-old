					<p>I&#039;ve been trying to follow the <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=25124#p25124">steps laid out by Bill_MI</a> to set up a bridged OpenVPN server, but i&#039;m not having much luck.</p><p>The fly in the ointment, I think, is that I&#039;m running a split LAN and WirelessLAN setup, that is to say that wired users get a 172.16/12 IP and wireless users a 10/8 IP.&nbsp; This means I don&#039;t have a br0 interface by default and instead of simply running <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>openvpn --mktun --dev tap0
brctl addif br0 tap0</code></pre></div><p>i have to create the bridge first, and add my wired interface, since that is the subnet I would like VPN&#039;d users to appear as coming from.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>openvpn --mktun --dev tap0
brctl addbr br0
brctl addif br0 tap0
brctl addif br0 vlan0</code></pre></div><p>The problem:&nbsp; I lose network connectivity to my router as soon as I run the last line, <strong>brctl addif br0 vlan0</strong></p><p>I&#039;m pretty comfortable with both OpenWRT and OpenVPN, but this is a combination I&#039;ve never tried before.&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated, and I&#039;ll be happy to add more information about config files and interface setups as needed.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Waldo,</p><p>I would figure the docs would cover your case.&nbsp; It&#039;s been a while since I went through them but br0 was getting in the way with the step-by-steps.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t bridge tap0 to vlan0 using newly created br1 because vlan0 was already in br0.&nbsp; So... can&#039;t beat &#039;em... join &#039;em. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />&nbsp; Yes, it only works with stock bridged br0 of vlan0/eth1 which the docs seemed to ignore.</p><p>I think Puncher&#039;s suggestion was to add <strong>ifconfig (interface) up</strong> for tap0 and maybe vlan1 and br0 after creating br0 like you already tried.&nbsp; You may have to do it in a script since you loose connectivity to test it via commandline.&nbsp; You may want to use br1 just to avoid any other system scripts involving br0.</p><p>My own confusion starts when standard system scripts, like ifup, uses the ifname/ifnames variables - you may be fighting these, too.&nbsp; I&#039;d welcome a good overview of this.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Bill_MI</strong> on 26 Jun 2006, 14:47)</p>
