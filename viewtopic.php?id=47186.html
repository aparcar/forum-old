					<p>So, I got to compile an image for my router, and it&#039;s pretty cool. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> I get to install everything I want and even leave some free space, which wasn&#039;t possible.</p><p>Now my question is, how do I do when a new build comes out... Updating SVN, GIT, and so on. I&#039;m using Debian to compile.</p><p>I believe I have to do something like, starting from scratch in console.</p><p>svn update<br />./scripts/feeds update -a<br />./scripts/feeds install -a<br />make menuconfig<br />make</p><p>Is that all? Am I missing something?<br />What if I do &quot;make dirclean&quot;? It&#039;s the same?<br />If I do &quot;make distclean&quot;, then I only have to follow directions in openwrt wiki...</p><p>EDIT: Maybe git is missing here...?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MataRatos</strong> on 5 Nov 2013, 22:27)</p>
