					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>I am using OpenWrt snapshot r31782 (self-compiled on a Debian Squeeze system) on a TP-Link WR703N. Everything is running smooth and I&#039;m happy with it.</p><p>What I now would like to do is integrate pactester (see <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pacparser/)">http://code.google.com/p/pacparser/)</a>. So I created a directory &quot;feeds/packages/net/pactester&quot; and threw a Makefile in, which I took from one of the other packages and which I modified (download URL, md5sum, Package name and so on) to match pactester.</p><p>Unfortunately, when it builds, it&#039;s a i386 binary, not a mips one. :-(( I think that&#039;s because I&#039;m building on i386 architecture.</p><p>Does anybody have an idea on how the Makefile must look alike to do cleanly cross-compile pactester for mips? In short, the following things would have to be done:<br />- Source URL is <a href="http://pacparser.googlecode.com/files/pacparser-1.3.0.tar.gz">http://pacparser.googlecode.com/files/p â€¦ 3.0.tar.gz</a><br />- after unpack, chdir to pacparser-1.3.0/src/<br />- issue &quot;make pactester&quot;</p><p>Any help appreciated.</p><p>Thanks!<br />Sven</p>									</div>

					<p>I found out that I need to modify the Makefile to use a different CC and LD. But now I run into a second problem:<br />- During the build process of pacparser, there is a binary &quot;jscpucfg&quot; buillt. This gets compiled as mips binary. Good.<br />- I few lines later in the Makefile, the just built &quot;jscpucfg&quot; binary is called. This means calling a mips binary on the building i386 host, which of course does not work.</p><p>Anybody any hints? Is there a &quot;mips-emulator&quot; in the build environment for these cases?</p><p>Many thanks,<br />Sven</p>									</div>
