					<p>Hello,</p><p>I need some help with VLAN&#039;s on the WNDR3700. (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3700">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3700</a>)</p><p>My situation:<br />* 1 WAN port<br />--&gt;<br />* 3 LAN ports (1,2,3) which is internal network (also with wifi). Internal network gets 1 external IP through WAN port. (IP: ~8x.xxx.xxx.xxx)<br />* 1 LAN port (0) which has to bypass the dhcp and get straight through the WAN port another IP (with another range, netmask, DNS,...) (IP: ~10.xxx.xx.xx)</p><p>How is it the best way to solve this problem?<br />I&#039;ve already tried some VLAN&#039;s and bridges, nothing worked for me. Does someone have a solution for this? I&#039;ve been testing for over a day now. Really sick of it.<br />Funny thing that on DD-WRT (other router) it&#039;s a simple VLAN config. (1,2,3+LAN) (0+WAN).</p><p>The correct setup is:<br />Modem -&gt; Switch -&gt; TV Decoder | Router -&gt; other stuff<br />I&#039;d like:<br />Modem -&gt; Router -&gt; TV Decoder | other stuff</p><p>If more info is needed, i&#039;m always ready to provide the info.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Dima_2005,</p><p>Assuming you&#039;re also a Belgian Telenet user (your username looks familiar from the TIK forum) - we can communicate in Dutch if you&#039;d like.</p><p>I&#039;m going to try a simpler solution as soon as I get the opportunity: I&#039;ve compiled my own firmware for my WNDR3700v2 with support for USB ethernet dongles. I&#039;ve plugged an Apple USB network dongle in my router and bridged it to the WAN port. Now I just need to plug my Digicorder in there and see if everything still works as expected. No need to mess with VLANs.</p><p>Groeten,</p><p>Bob</p>									</div>

					<p>THanks guys,<br />I&#039;ll try the VLAN config of jow when I get home.<br />ALthough I&#039;m pretty sure that I tried this config. And then I didn&#039;t have a WAN IP (but I&#039;ll try copy/paste of this, maybe it&#039;ll work better)</p>									</div>

					<p>There are two things to consider when bridging wan to one of the lan ports:<br />- the effective wan facing mac address might change, so maybe you need to reset your cable modem (plug power for 30 seconds) after implementing this config<br />- a client on the patched-through lan port might request dhcp before the router is able to, e.g. during boot, so make sure the remote actually offers multiple leases</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi jow,</p><p>The client on the patched-through port actually gets a specific (private) IP address from directly from the cable provider, AFAIK in the 10.x.x.x range, so that shouldn&#039;t be a problem.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, guys.<br />I got it! I was using the arokh build, so actually had to configure via Luci and not through the config files (because firewall and some other configs aren&#039;t updated).</p><p>I just checked the config file and configured it though the GUI.<br />For further reference:</p><p>1) Go to Switch VLAN, set the port which is used to Off in VLAN 1<br />2) Add another VLAN (2), set the port used to untagged and CPU to tagged<br />3) Go to WAN, go to physical settings, enable bridge and select eth1 and the VLAN interface you just created (eth0.2)<br />4) Reboot by removing power and putting it back on.<br />5) Enjoy <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
