					<p>On my x-wrt install, I have a ~140Kb list of WhiteRussian packages, a ~247Kb list of 0.9-backports packages and a ~200Kb list of X-Wrt packages.</p><p>That&#039;s pushing 600Kb on a 4Mb router <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/yikes.png" width="15" height="15" alt="yikes" />&nbsp; - Even compressed, that was enough to stop asterisk installing.</p><p>So I deleted the lists, made a temporary folder, and a symbolic link from the old list location to the temporary folder and a bit of tweaking:</p><p>*** Warning: This will lose the package lists after every reboot and require directory recreating to fix it ***</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cd /jffs/usr/lib/ipkg
rm -rf lists
mkdir /tmp/lists
ln -s /tmp/lists lists
reboot</code></pre></div><p>The reboot is for jffs to refresh and show the freed up space. There may be a neater way than that, but that works. I then had ~1.6Mb free instead of ~1.2Mb.</p><p>After rebooting, the symbolic link is broken because the tmp filesystem is lost during a reboot. Still, we can recreate it:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cd /jffs/usr/lib/ipkg
rm lists
mkdir /tmp/lists
ln -s /tmp/lists lists</code></pre></div><p>Now you can refresh the lists:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ipkg update</code></pre></div><p>And then retry installing whatever it is that you wanted.</p>									</div>
