Maybe not. Memory can trick you. But you certenly did not warn me about that. I am sure that you can understand that two people looking at the same thing/problem/something can have different perception and emotional response so if you don&#039;t tell me that you are offended with something you can&#039;t be sure I am aware of that. There are so many different cultural, religious, ... variations that one must not assume everyone is the same as he is.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>sveasoft wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>and then posted emotional flames about your previous posts having been deleted.</p></blockquote></div><p>If calming down another user by saying that I don&#039;t believe that you have deleted messages intentionaly and that it must be a database error is emotional flame - they yes - I am guilty, but I guess that most of the people didn&#039;t see it like flaming.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>sveasoft wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I also seem to recall some email exchanges we had.</p></blockquote></div><p>That is a problem with &quot;recall&quot;. I seem to recall that we have never exchanged anything via e-mail. I only contacted you via PM and only concerning payment method and one mac removal. I guess with so many users you should not allow your judgement be guided by recall.&nbsp; If you decide to punish someone be sure you have some evidence. That is why I asked you to display my &quot;flaming&quot; message - I wanted others to verify that it was really so flaming that I deserve to be punished (or not - so my name should be cleared - and I do care about my name, that is why I am not changing it on various forums). </p><div class="quotebox"><cite>sveasoft wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Anyway - if you want a refund include the request in your email.</p></blockquote></div><p>Getting money back is less satisfaction for me than you admiting that you have overreacted and mixed me with someone else who was really flaming. It&#039;s up to you. You can always reach me by e-mail or PM here (or on your own forum if you let me back in :-) )</p><p>Regards.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dixie</strong> on 23 Mar 2006, 13:30)</p>

Today, I finally came across some news, though FAR from what I had hoped ! </p><p>&quot;Talisman/Hotspot will be based on a shared billing model for anyone charging for Hotspot use and an advertising model for anyone offering free access. If you charge, Sveasoft receives 5% of the gross proceeds. If you do not charge we add a small Google banner to the bottom of your splash page. Hopefully folks will find this an acceptable model and Hotspot use will grow rapidly. &quot; </p><p>Seems like the ONLY firmware NOT on a &quot;open source&quot; model has once again found a new and exciting way to dip into one&#039;s pocket. After a years wait, and having paid $20 for it&#039;s &quot;subscription&quot; for firmware of questionable quality, James of Sveasoft has sprung this upon its subscribers with little warning. </p><p>Sorry, James.......I believe I will let my subscription to your &quot;site&quot; lapse. Given that there are MULTIPLE FREE versions of firmware, most of which FAR less &quot;buggy&quot; than your version of the firmware......I believe I will migrate to them, rather than waste any more time with YOUR less-than-adequate firmware. </p><br/><p>And the Result ? : </p><p>Having vented some of my disappointment regarding Sveasoft&#039;s efforts to dig even deeper in the pockets of his subscribers regarding his &quot;Business Model&quot; concerning his &quot;upcoming&quot; release of his Talisman/Hotspot......I purused his web site once more today to see if OTHER subscribers had succeeded in changing his mind in this matter: after all, I had purchased a subscription and have a RIGHT to do so, at least until my subscription expires, wouldn&#039;t you think ? Evidently, Sveasoft thinks otherwise ! </p><p>&quot;Your access to Sveasoft has been revoked. <br/>Please contact the webmaster or board administrator for more information. &quot; </p><br/><p>Evidently, James of Sveasoft seems to feel he has some sort of God-given right to censor discussion not only on HIS site, but also the right to censor discussion on OTHER Web sites ! In doing so, he evidently ALSO feels he has some sort of right to STEAL peoples money without repercussion or consequence. </p><p>Well, all I can say, James : If I can discourage even ONE person from falling victim to your style of theft, by posting on this site and others....... Well, that makes that loss of $20 well worth it, don&#039;t you think, James</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, it is his website. However we feel about his relatively childish behaviour for a businessman, he is free to kick you out of his treehouse. If you refuse to don the Cape of Obeisance, and say the Secret Oath, you can be forever banished.</p><p>Venting here makes you feel better, but it&#039;s preaching to the choir. I&#039;d request a refund if I were you.</p><p>I&#039;m rather more concerned about his business practices and GPL compliance. Also this whole business where he keeps trying to have it every way that is convenient at the moment is troubling. I believe when he booted Ephraim, the Paypal denial of refund stated software had been sold &amp; shipped to the person so refund denied. Which is at odds with the claim that no software is sold, only access to support forums.</p><p>It&#039;s all just increasingly difficult to put together in a sensible way. James statements sound like the GPL is the Mark of the Commie Beast.&nbsp; I wonder why if it&#039;s such anathema to him, he did not base his work on VxWorks OS or something else commercially licensable instead of Linux and GPL code. That would have been much more inline with his apparent philosophy, and would be much easier to support a simple buy-my-amazing-firmware model.&nbsp; If you truly believe that software developers deserve unending profits for their work, then logically you should only base your own work on licensed and proprietary OS.&nbsp; To use OSS/GPL as a software base, implies supporting Karl Marx.&nbsp; Some people think &quot;free&quot; just means you don&#039;t have to pay for it. They miss either through ignorance or blindness, that &quot;free&quot; in the OSS/GPL world means there may be some baggage if their intention is other than keeping it &quot;free&quot;.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 24 Mar 2006, 01:11)</p>
