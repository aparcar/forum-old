					<p>Hi,</p><p>For some reason I have a situation when the dns record of my win machine and its ip address assigned by the router do not match. Like the real ip of the machine is 10.10.10.10 and nslookup on the router shows 10.10.10.11 on that machine name. In the table of all dhcp leases I see both ip addresses associated with the same mac address. So it is only possible to connect to this win machine using it&#039;s ip and not the name. I tried to restart dnsmasq (/etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart (start/stop also)) but it doesn&#039;t help</p><p>As a workaround I specified hostnames in one of the luci configs. But this maps ip addresses to host names which is imho not correct because the router assigns ips dynamically. It would be correct if I could map machine mac address to its hostname.</p>									</div>
