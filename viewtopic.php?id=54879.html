					<p>Noob here - trying to set up a wifi repeater on a home network.&nbsp; Have found many posts with command line instructions.&nbsp; Have found a youtube video, but it seems incomplete.</p><p>My hardware is a TrendNet TEW-712BR - have installed Barrier Breaker - can login through ssh and web interface.</p><p>I have used dd-wrt before, but it does not support this router.</p><p>Is it not possible to set up a repeater through Luci?&nbsp; Can&#039;t find a &quot;recipe&quot; or &quot;howto&quot; specific to repeaters - maybe it&#039;s labeled something different?</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>Upon additional searching, it appears what I want is a &quot;repeater bridge&quot; - I want all routers and clients to be in the same sub net - I&#039;m ok with losing 1/2 of my speed.&nbsp; But again, I find a variety of instructions both console and console / gui mixed - but nothing consistent.&nbsp; I also don&#039;t find any specific &quot;recipe&quot; or &quot;howto&quot; for setting up a &quot;repeater bridge&quot;.&nbsp; I&#039;m hesitant to simply do &quot;trial and error&quot; as I fear I might brick my router - and I&#039;m not confident that I could bring it back.</p><p>If my information request is too complex - or too simplistic, just let me know.&nbsp; But I feel from reading the form posts regarding repeaters, that many are in the &quot;same boat&quot; as I with no definitive documentation to follow.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; Regarding the following:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;wwan&#039;
    option proto &#039;static&#039;
    option ipaddr &#039;192.168.1.254&#039; #match you main router network 192.168.x.254
    option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039; 
    option gateway &#039;192.168.1.1&#039;   #your main router&#039;s IP</code></pre></div><p>...I have a static machine (actually a Slingbox) at 192.168.1.254.&nbsp; Will the wwan configuration not cause a conflict?</p><p>Again, sorry for my ignorance - I just don&#039;t want to screw anything up.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, I changed the slingbox static IP to something else - used the configuration you suggested - but got nothing.&nbsp; Reading further, I find instructions about installing relayd and/or using WDS.&nbsp; Again, trial &amp; error which I&#039;m sure will eventually brick my router.&nbsp; I&#039;m about to give up...</p>									</div>
