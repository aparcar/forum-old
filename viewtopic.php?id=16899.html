					<p>At least I will be interested to see this supported in OpenWRT. But as this package is Java based, it will require a powerful enough hardware and I doubt it will be possible to encode/decode the RTP stream in realtime on the commonly used Broadcom platforms (WRT54G/GS, WL500G/p/W etc.)</p>									</div>

					<p>What about running it on an AR7 platform that has a built-in voice chip to process the codec? For those who are interested in the Legerity voice chip on an AR7 platform, please have a look <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WRTP54G">here</a> to find out its specs and drivers.</p>									</div>

					<p>The WRTP54G is built on the Titan AR7 platform, but most of the supported AR7 devices are built on the Sangam platform. So far, all attempts to boot an OpenWRT kernel on a Titan CPU have failed miserably. The platform support must be rewritten from scratch, yet again.</p>									</div>
