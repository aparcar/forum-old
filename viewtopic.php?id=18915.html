					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to test the ath9k driver on a RB433 equipped with a ubiquiti SR71A mini pci card. On the 2.4 ghz, I could connect to the AP in G mode but no N. My client is a intel 4965 agn card running on debian with the 2.6.28-1 snapshot kernel. I also installed the last version of compat-wireless dated 11 of february. Under windows XP (also running the last version of the proset utility and drivers) i also can connect in G mode but no N. The log reports a odd error &quot;security mismatch with 11n&quot;, which really looks like something they use in general when something goes wrong because it appears also when no encryption is selected (open AP). On the support page, they say that one can expect performance better than 56 mbits only when using wpa2 personal AES or no encryption, and it&#039;s strongly adviced to use the 5 ghz channels for an effective channel bonding. <br />Following this advice, i got a set of 3 dual band antennas and I started testing such a configuration. By the way, I&#039;m stuck on configuring the interface because hostapd refuse to set up the interface on the 5 ghz channels.</p><p>This is my wireless configuration</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/lib/wifi# cat /etc/config/wireless

					<p>After days of googling around, I could understand that this was an issue related to regulatory stuff. I also posted in the hostapd mailing list, an a nice soul answered (even if I can&#039;t really understand at this stage what type of operating mode can be enabled on 5 ghz). <br />I doubt the ubiquiti will listen to a request like that, because they push their airos, like mikrotik does with its RouterOS. By the way, all this looking around for informations is really stessing, as everyone talks only to literate and never take time to introduce concepts to freshers.<br />For example, we know that hostapd is supporting 802.11n from 0.6.7 version. Should I understand that similar steps should also be taken on the client side? When using wpa_supplicant, what I&#039;m supposed to do? SHould I pre-configure the interface with the iw utility, or should I assume a certain level of automatic configuration?</p>									</div>

					<p>I have been searching around for this terminology, if I understood well, passive scanning referes to a type of association protocol which is taken on by station machines and does not refer directly to AP mode. I can&#039;t explain to myself why it should avoid the equipment to be set as AP. Moreover, assuming that AP can&#039;t be configured, the output of &quot;iw list&quot; makes me understand that neither ad-hoc mode is avaliable (no ibss). So, should we assume that 5 ghz can&#039;t be used at all? Maybe every manufacturer which relies on atheros chips is hardcoding a personal country code and regdomain value in this eeprom which is later correctly decoded by their proprietary os and drivers?<br />I found on various mailing lists some examples on how to change the regulatory domains, as for example<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iw reg set US</code></pre></div><p>but countries other than US are never accepted. Personally, I think that the reason for such a behaviour is maybe related to legal questions (or even economics) and not to technical ones. I found <a href="http://www.chineselinuxuniversity.net/courses/kernel/articles/21751.shtml">here</a> something interesting about the subject.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>simone78</strong> on 17 Feb 2009, 00:35)</p>

					<p>Thats good news, so it seem you have the right card (eeprom).<br />I comiled OpenWrt (x86) today and installed it. I thought for a moment that I could use 5Ghz channels in AP mode since It was avalible in Luci. But no, iw list confirmed that I had only passive scanning, no-ibss. </p><p>The file transfere speed I got (2.4Ghz) was between 5 and 7 MBytes/sek. I was quite close, about 2 Meters from my AP.</p>									</div>

					<p>I had the same problem with 5 GHz band disabled. I&#039;ve fixed it by removing ath9k default regdomain restrictions and now all channels are usable. </p><p>But switching to 5 Ghz band didn&#039;t help my win xp clients with Intel Wifi 5100 and 5300 to connect in N mode, while Broadcom client works in N mode in both 2.4 and 5 GHz bands.
