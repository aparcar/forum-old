					<p>Hello all,<br />well I can set up the OpenVPN-Server on OpenWRT (on laFonera) using the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenVPNHowTo">HowTo</a>. But what IÂ´d love to enable is L2TP/IPsec for the VPN connection so I can connect to it without any additional client software, as WinXP has already got VPN-client included (but only for PPTP and L2DP/IPsec).<br />oh, and I don&#039;t want to use PPTP as this requires GRE and my ISP blocks it for some reasons.<br />can anyone help me out?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>yj</strong> on 10 Mar 2007, 16:02)</p>

					<p>1)&nbsp; That OpenVPN HowTo in the OpenWRT wiki didn&#039;t work for me on 0.9 Final.&nbsp; The router accepted all of the configuration settings and it appeared as if the OpenVPN process successfully started up, but I could never get my router to dish out an ip address over the tunnel.&nbsp; See: <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=9601">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=9601</a></p><p>2)&nbsp; OpenVPN uses SSL, not L2TP or IPSEC.&nbsp; From openvpn.net:</p><p><strong>Does OpenVPN support IPSec or PPTP?</strong></p><p>There are three major families of VPN implementations in wide usage today: SSL, IPSec, and PPTP. OpenVPN is an SSL VPN and as such is not compatible with IPSec, L2TP, or PPTP.</p><p>The IPSec protocol is designed to be implemented as a modification to the IP stack in kernel space, and therefore each operating system requires its own independent implementation of IPSec.</p><p>By contrast, OpenVPN&#039;s user-space implementation allows portability across operating systems and processor architectures, firewall and NAT-friendly operation, dynamic address support, and multiple protocol support including protocol bridging.</p><p>There are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches. The principal advantages of OpenVPN&#039;s approach are portability, ease of configuration, and compatibility with NAT and dynamic addresses. The learning curve for installing and using OpenVPN is on par with that of other security-related daemon software such as ssh.</p><p>Historically, one of IPSec&#039;s advantages has been multi-vendor support, though that is beginning to change as OpenVPN support is beginning to appear on dedicated hardware devices.</p><p>While the PPTP protocol has the advantage of a pre-installed client base on Windows platforms, analysis by cryptography experts has revealed security vulnerabilities.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tpdean</strong> on 12 Mar 2007, 15:32)</p>
