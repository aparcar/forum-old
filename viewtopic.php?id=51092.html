					<p>Hello, </p><p>I am testing with our built image from OpenWrt trunk source codes (outdated by more than 1 year)</p><p>During checking, I observed that static routes configured manually through LUCI WEB UI are not installed.<br />As I traced netifd codes with debug enabled, I could see that static routes are installed but removed in some cases like &quot;ifup wan&quot; or &quot;/etc/init.d/network reload&quot;. <br />From further trace, my understanding is as below.<br />-. In interface_change_config() called by interface_update(),&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;reload_ip is always true. Consequently, interface_ip_set_enabled for both config_ip and proto_ip is called with false initially. However, interface_ip_set_enabled for config_ip is not called with true. This makes static routes uninstalled.<br />-. Why reload_ip is always true even though nothing is changed in configuration is that ip6table value for interface is set to default value which is incremented per interface basis. <br />For now, IPv6 support is not included in my works. So, I blocked a line regarding ip6table default setting and could see that static routes are not lost in any cases.<br />However, I wonder why this unexpected problem happened. if you have helpful explanation and advices for this topic, please let me know. <br />(Currently, netifd-2013-05-30 is being used and some(not much) modifications are applied for our HW platform.)</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>Same problem here. All my static routes configured via web-interface are not visible in route -n. However, if I type them manually they work ofc.</p><p>The configuration looks as follows:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config route                 
        option interface &#039;lan&#039;        
        option gateway &#039;192.168.1.1&#039;
        option target &#039;78.152.49.168&#039;
        option netmask &#039;255.255.255.248&#039;
                      
config route                  
        option interface &#039;lan&#039;      
        option target &#039;206.190.151.80&#039;
        option gateway &#039;192.168.1.1&#039;</code></pre></div>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ElLoco</strong> on 25 Jul 2014, 17:26)</p>
