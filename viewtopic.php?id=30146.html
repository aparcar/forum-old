					<p>I installed OpenWRT on the Buffalo WZR-HP-300NH a week ago (first time using OpenWRT).&nbsp; It was working without issues, except that i wanted to make it an wireless access point bridge to an existing wired router.&nbsp; From the GUI i tried to join same network as the wired network by turning of the DHCP of the LAN on buffalo.&nbsp; This ended up being a huge mistake , as I have not been able to access the router since I made the changes.&nbsp; To make things worse I had the wifi turned off.&nbsp; Since then, I have tried pressing the reset button, but it does nothing.&nbsp; I have tried to do a 30/30/30 hard reset, which does not seem to work for OpenWRT.&nbsp; I have also tried the failsafe method mentioned for Buffalo GP-125 and I have not been able to telnet into the box.</p><p>The only time my computer can even see network port as up is when i manually set the port IP as an 192.168.20.x IP address.&nbsp; Other times it just tells me that the network port is down.&nbsp; Prior to removing the DHCP, the router had the IP address 192.168.20.181.&nbsp; When I run nmap it tells me that 192.168.20.181 is up, however when I try to type the address in my browser, or SSH to that IP it fails.&nbsp; </p><p>Can someone let me know how i can either (1) access the router or (2) reset the router settings so I can access the router.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Sudhakar2k</strong> on 23 May 2011, 09:33)</p>

					<p>Well I download the file to my machine, telneted into the router, and then scped the file into the router and executed it.&nbsp; It did not automatically reboot, but after a hard reboot, it had been completely reset to openwrt defaults.&nbsp; So thank you FYI for your help.&nbsp; My router is up and running again.&nbsp; The new firmware 10.03.1-rc4 seems to be more stable than 10.03 as well. Also I don&#039;t seem to have to reboot after making changes to the router settings as I was doing before.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Sudhakar2k</strong> on 25 May 2011, 07:32)</p>
