					<p>Assuming that I have a OpenWrt client which works in STA mode and I have defined somewhere networks A, B, C. When the station is in A station coverage it connects to A, if it is in B station coverage it connects to B and so on... A, B, C are in totally different locations so they won&#039;t overlap. It is a normal operation for e.g. Ubuntu clients or Windows clients - they connect to WiFi AP which they have remembered and the clients are in range of the remembered AP. Is it possible to achieve that with OpenWrt &quot;in the box&quot;?</p>									</div>

					<p>I can&#039;t find any information about that. I have an idea about solving in out of the box: running service which scans available SSIDs and executes uci commands when one of the defined AP has been found. But I&#039;m looking for a solution &quot;in the box&quot;.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you very much for Your support.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>eduperez wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I would just configure all those networks as wireless clients, and bridge them together to the same WWAN; it just takes a few minutes, and you can easily see in the logs how it behaves.</p></blockquote></div><p>I&#039;ve done using the approach @eduperez had proposed: Firstly I added some wifi-ifaces in <em>/etc/config/wireless</em>:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-iface
        option device &#039;radio0&#039;
        option network &#039;wlan0&#039;
        option mode &#039;sta&#039;
        option ssid &#039;TESTAP1&#039;
        option encryption &#039;psk2&#039;
        option key &#039;makapaka&#039;

config wifi-iface
        option device &#039;radio0&#039;
        option network &#039;wlan1&#039;
        option ssid &#039;TESTAP2&#039;
        option mode &#039;sta&#039;
        option encryption &#039;psk2&#039;
        option key &#039;makapaka&#039;</code></pre></div><p>and corresponding records in <em>/etc/config/network</em>:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;wlan0&#039;
        option proto &#039;dhcp&#039;
        option metric &#039;1&#039;

config interface &#039;wlan1&#039;
        option proto &#039;dhcp&#039;
        option metric &#039;1&#039;</code></pre></div><p>And bridged the interfaces:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;wlan&#039;
        option type &#039;bridge&#039;
        option ifname &#039;wlan0 wlan1&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Now I have another question: should the firewall rules work on such a bridge if earlier I have had only one interface defined which had been called <em>wlan</em>?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>KKoovalsky</strong> on 6 Feb 2018, 19:26)</p>
