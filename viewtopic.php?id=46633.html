					<p>Hi.</p><p>I ordered a touchscreen tft set for my raspberry pi - and yet, I don&#039;t know what I will do with it.. But for sure, graphic support is in my mind. First I thought about qt5, but it seems a bit overkill for openwrt.. But why not qt5 as well, but so far, there isn&#039;t a fully working port of qt5 for openwrt, so I decided to look further..</p><p>And found a project ilixi ( <a href="http://www.ilixi.org">http://www.ilixi.org</a> ) and thought that it&#039;s more openwrt style than qt5..<br />Check the website to find out what it is..</p><p>Anyway, for best support for ilixi I need to upgrade libdirectfb from 1.4.x to 1.7--<br />And I&#039;ve done great progress, everything compiles just great- needed to add dependencies for libstdcpp and librt..<br />But finally my build fails.. When it checks for depended libraries; list says I am lacking<br />libdirect-1.4.so<br />libdirectfb-1.4.so<br />libfusion-1.4.so</p><p>Well, my package builds all these libraries, but with version 1.7..<br />I added a dirty hack to my libdirectfb-1.7 Makefile which symlinks 1.7 libraries to 1.4 libraries and like I was afraid of..<br />This didn&#039;t do the job.. So, what causes my build to be dependant of version 1.4?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jake1981</strong> on 9 Oct 2013, 23:02)</p>

					<p>Okay, whole sunday of working and progress has been made. I didn&#039;t start fresh, I took kleistpark packages to my working base.. ( <a href="http://ilixi.org/index.php?id=kleistpark">http://ilixi.org/index.php?id=kleistpark</a> ) - And by this, I ofcourse mean the source..</p><p>Then I did what I described earlier; update libdirectfb to 1.7..<br />Don&#039;t know what version is kleistpark packages supposed for-- since they definetly didn&#039;t compile easily.. After many patches, updates, and so on.. I finally have got something compiled and I could say that my work leaded to something, following is now compiled as packages:<br />-libdirectfb 1.7 ( with ONE )<br />-cairo<br />-clanbomber ( some kind of game to test directfb&#039;s functionality ? )<br />-dfbterm<br />-directfb-examples<br />-harfbuzz (library)<br />-libenchant<br />-libicu<br />-fusiondale<br />-fusionsound<br />-ilixi (libglesv2 disabled by patching)<br />-lite<br />-pixman<br />-sawman</p><p>And still got some more packages from kleistpark that I want to make work but unfortunately my time now runs out..</p><p>I had to add fontconfig from old tree to my build as it was dependency..</p><p>---<br />Can&#039;t say if any of my work actually works or does anything that could be seen by human eye on the hdmi screen of raspberry pi, as I haven&#039;t installed any of this stuff, but will try everything as soon as I have managed to compile all packages that I wanted to test.<br />If these packages aren&#039;t familiar to you, check out <a href="http://www.directfb.org">http://www.directfb.org</a> - </p><p>Most of ffmpeg code in these files is using deprecated functions so I&#039;ve been patching them to proper builds..<br />And makefile&#039;s of packages have been sometimes forced to work by some ugly hacks, so my work isn&#039;t ready to be included in the trunk any time soon, but if I get something that works; I will publish it somewhere, propably on the github.. Maybe someone else then could be a nice guy and clean up the Makefiles so they could be included in svn-- or maybe this stuff is better to stay &quot;outside&quot; as a external repository.. libdirectfb 1.7 includes ONE that should be available as an invidual package instead, but I was in a hurry so I just included one to same package.. Maybe this is going to stay out from openwrt trunk a long time because this stuff works only on minority of devices, I mean, I guess raspberry pi is propably only officially supported device with actual framebuffer..</p><p>Feel free to discuss about topic and I&#039;ll gladly share my progress if someone&#039;s interested (as soon as it&#039;s functional enough) - ilixi, qt5, X, so on are easily available for raspberry on raspbian and similar distributions, but I really don&#039;t think I need such bloated system, after all, I propably rather use my Mac if I need openoffice or if I want to play games or edit/watch videos, although, afaik XBMC on raspberry isn&#039;t all bad..</p><p>EDIT: Forgot to mention, flux needed to be installed on the host system, <a href="http://www.directfb.org/index.php?path=Main%2FDownloads">http://www.directfb.org/index.php?path=Main%2FDownloads</a><br />Didn&#039;t add it to buildroot, as it was small, just downloaded, compiled and installed it to /usr/bin..</p><p>EDIT2: Updated list - now I have everything compiling that I wanted.. Maybe I&#039;ll have tomorrow time to test this stuff <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jake1981</strong> on 7 Oct 2013, 21:44)</p>

					<p>Started my work fresh from the beginning and--</p><p>Now I have got directfb-git (1.8.0) compiled with support for acceleration (egl)..<br />Build requires toolchain with eglibc instead of uclibc and a development package based on raspberry pi firmware..</p><p>Test show&#039;d earlier that unaccelerated directfb was able to animate on FPS 15.. So I am curious to see when I get this done, what will fps be on accelerated version..</p><p>Too bad I have to go work early, so I cannot stay wake to see if I get all my packages compiled ok and image produced so I could see.. Well, continues on tomorrow.. (Or later today, in case that I cannot sleep before I get to test this;)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jake1981</strong> on 10 Oct 2013, 00:49)</p>

					<p>One more thing- original kleistpark directfb was supposed to compile on to 2 targets: raspberry pi(=brcm2708) and x86.<br />X86 version was un-accelerated. This has been a lot of work and due to the fact that most useful applications seem to require acceleration - or if they don&#039;t.. User experience is bad (ilixi carcomputer for example was completely un-usable as un-accelerated since the screen went to monochrome mode and was failing to draw itself properly) or useless, I am going to forget x86 support.</p><p>AFAIK OpenWrt has never been a OS for gamers, maybe I can find some accelerated directfb games to bring a change to this <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> Just kidding.. ClanBomber2 is already included in kleistpark if I want to test..</p>									</div>

					<p>Progress stopped to libtool issues with cairo - Finally, I got it done by some trickery and then happened then I blew it..<br />I was supposed to remove some temporary files but I was in a wrong tty.. And ofcourse I had used rm -rf..<br />Therefore I erased allmost all my work.. Luckily I had some backups and was able to salvage some of my work, but what an awful drawback.. Now, I need to redo some of my work <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>

					<p>I got it compiled, andi3d and other 3d functions don&#039;t perform, causes a network/input restarts constantlly <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />on andi I get 60fps.. Ilixi works, with problems; mouse/keyboard/eventX fails, system looses focus due to network/input restarts.. Multimode failing.. Surfaces failing..</p><p>Abandoning project for a while.. Maybe when directfb/openwrt is more prepared for raspberry pi..</p>									</div>
