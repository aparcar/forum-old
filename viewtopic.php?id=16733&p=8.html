					<p>Hi<br />thanks for testing the patch. Yes, only linux 2.4 is supported for now, and it will probably stay that way until broadcom releases 2.6 wireless driver, or some HW programing documentation.<br />I am now working on the wireless driver, but getting the binary-only driver working is not easy, so will take some time.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, if you find some time to give VLANs some spin, it would be great. I didn&#039;t have time to test them properly, and I don&#039;t know if they will just work, or if some more tweaking will be required. I plan to get back to it when basic wireless works.<br />Also, checking out jumbo frames would be nice, although I haven&#039;t even checked if OpenWRT supports them at all yet...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Kicker</strong> on 1 Sep 2009, 17:16)</p>

It is necessary to modify quite a few source files in the kernel to add all the missing symbols required. Then the module loads (but does not work so far, probably still some modifications missing).</p>									</div>

The sources of DD-WRT are probably too different from OpenWRT (never checked). You may be better off starting with the original Linksys sources (that&#039;s what I am doing). If you start with the DD-WRT, look at some of the later releases, there were some strange problems in the early days of WRT610N support (router rebooting spontaneously with both wireless on etc.). Not sure if the support in DD-WRT is finished now...</p>									</div>

					<p>I am answering my own question..</p><p>TFTP recovery console accepts ONLY legit linksys firmware images AND is <strong>limited to 3.8mb</strong> - to upload bigger images - use console or web interface (depends on image you are previously using) - or web browser tool called <em>Management Firmware update</em>..</p><p>Source of this information and instructions are available on <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Linksys_WRT610N">DD-wrt&#039;s wiki for wrt610n</a>..</p><p>Even so - I used Management Firmware update tool to upload my image and this ended up with a bricked router - I tested it with ddwrt image (bigger than 5mb) - and it worked, so the problem must be within my image. And yes, I don&#039;t have serial console so that&#039;s why I cannot show any logs or trace the problem..

					<p>Hello Jake,<br />I must admit I haven&#039;t tried to flash my WRT610N yet, I am booting it for image testing using ftfp without flashing so far, as I need to use the device for normal operation as well.<br />I haven&#039;t tried 2.6 kernel, as there is currently no hope for wireless in 2.6. Although I think I remember someone posting some log of booting into 2.6.<br />With 2.4, I can successfully boot image I build and I can use wired networking. I can post my config, or even the image, if that helps (in the evening, when I get home). But not sure my image will be usable for you, it is customized to mount root on the USB stick for testing...</p><p>With the reset, I am afraid I can&#039;t help. Without logs from serial console, it is very difficult to troubleshoot...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Kicker</strong> on 25 Jan 2010, 12:48)</p>

					<p>Anyone able to build openwrt image with 2.6 kernel and drivers from dd-wrt? That would be great starting point for openwrt on wrt610n..</p>									</div>

					<p>I mean, if someone gets up a building environment that can make bootable image, even though some parts would error or warn, but with wired + telnet/ssh, I could try to help here too, maybe check out if I could bring some other stuff alive that maybe would initially be incorrectly set up (talking about base-files specific to this device here or device specific configurations and so on, not kernel hacking or adding vlan support to driver if that is missing or anything like that..)</p>									</div>

There are some binary drivers in the 2.6 tree, so it seems there is a hope for wireless in 2.6 after all. Unfortunately, so far I was not able to find any license for these binary drivers or where they came from, so it&#039;s still a question whether its usable for OpenWRT or not. Also, I remember seeing complaints on stability on the DD-WRT forums, not sure this got resolved. Drivers for 2.4 kernel are available and well tested in the original firmware, so the question is which way to go now.<br />But at least, it&#039;s a good motivation to start playing with the 2.6 kernel now :-).</p>									</div>
