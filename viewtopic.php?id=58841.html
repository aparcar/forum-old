					<p>Hello people of the openwrt forum!</p><p>I&#039;m writing in hopes that someone would be able to help me with the led configuration on said router. I wanted to turn off all the router&#039;s LED&#039;s through the webui. I was able to turn off all the lights except mamba:white:wlan_2g and mamba:white:wlan_5g (2.4Ghz and 5Ghz lights). They are turned off even if the trigger is set to none. I have very little knowledge about ssh and the commands, and I&#039;d be really greatfull if somebody could and would help.</p><p>I thank you for all the replies in advance</p><p>Cheers!</p>									</div>
