					<p>Hi,<br />My router: Dell Trumobile 2300 rev. A01 - old hardware with mini-pci radio (v1)<br />I&#039;m fairly new to OpenWrt and wanted to install Kamikaze 8.09 today. I started with installing WhiteRussian 0.90 and switching boot_wait to &#039;on&#039; as suggested here:<br /><a href="http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs(2f)Hardware(2f)Dell(2f)Truemobile2300.html">http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs( … e2300.html</a><br />This worked out well. Then I wanted to install Kamikaze 8.09 in its 2.6 kernel version. I left &#039;Delete jffs2 partition&#039; unticked. This time, updating ran much longer and didn&#039;t give any status report. From this time on I wasn&#039;t able to connect to my router, it doesn&#039;t react to ping or telnet commands, even with that vlan thing.<br />If I do start the Dell now (with no cables connected), the LAN LEDs go green for about a second. Then, everything is dark until power goes green after almost a minute.<br />Someone suggested using tcpdump, but my knowledge is too limited to get any useful information out of those logfiles.<br />Now, i still have some questions.</p><p>1) Does the routers IP address stay the same during the update process? Mine is defaulted at 192.168.2.1, but most people here talk about .1.1 instead. What about passwords?</p><p>2) Is there some way tftp-ing another firmware image without shorting the pins as suggested in &#039;Common mistakes&#039; #14? The referred troubleshooting page is not accessible any longer. If it&#039;s not, which pins to short? I know about nr. 9&amp;10, but I can neither identify the flash chip nor the pin numbers in here.</p><p>3) Has anyone successfully installed 8.09 on this router?</p><p>Thank you for your replies.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>soulsearchingsun83</strong> on 23 May 2009, 14:40)</p>

					<p>Further investigation brought this:<br />While booting, the router picks an IP address on the WAN side and responds to pings (arp reply 192.168.1.129 is-at 00:90:4b:xx:xx:xx (oui Unknown)) for about 30 seconds. But I&#039;m not able to tftp or telnet this device over this port. No answer on the other ports, still.</p><p>Please, can anyone help me?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>I was on the verge of installing 8.09 on my TM2003 v1 by following the instructions on the wiki (<a href="http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs(2f)Hardware(2f)Dell(2f)Truemobile2300.html">http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs( … e2300.html</a>) when I read your post.&nbsp; I think I&#039;ll hold back for now, it&#039;s running kind of ok with whiterussian 0.9.. but WPA2 doesn&#039;t work, which is the reason I wanted to upgrade to kamikaze.&nbsp; Did you ever revive your unit?&nbsp; Has anyone got 8.09 to work with a Truemobile 2003?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi<br />I&#039;m still wating for suggestions how to revive my router, I&#039;m feeling like I did anything I could imagine (this could be due to my limited knowledge, too).<br />Good luck, if you should try this anyways.</p>									</div>

					<p>The bootloader will probably use the 192.168.2.1 IP (I think) but Kamikaze will use 192.168.1.1 by default.</p><p>Try getting into <a href="http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs(2f)Troubleshooting.html#head-89dbf29c5213600ac070923f1aa347657699a1e9">failsafe mode</a> if you can.&nbsp; If you can&#039;t get into failsafe mode, see if you can reflash the router from the bootloader.&nbsp; I am not familiar with your router and haven&#039;t looked up what bootloader it uses, so I don&#039;t know if it supports TFTP or FTP etc., but if it does, give it a try.</p><p>You might need to get a serial cable hooked up to see what&#039;s going on.</p>									</div>
