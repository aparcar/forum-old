					<p>Hello</p><p>I have some prototype product, router with MT7620. On board it is also 64MB serial flash memory instaled SPI. U-Boot handling this memory also. In this moment I thinking about how to instaled OpenWRT. Whether arch MIPS is supported in OpenWRT with 64MB ? A looked on Device Tree, and I only saw driver <strong>m25p80</strong> which supporting probably max 32MB. So what if I whant&nbsp; more memory ?Which driver Can I use ? Is it possible at all ?</p>									</div>
