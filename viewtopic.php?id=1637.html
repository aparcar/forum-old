					<p>Greetings all:</p><p>&nbsp; I am working on a project that possibly needs to modify the wireless MAC layer things, setting values to MAC control frames before sending them out, for example. I would also like to implement PCF (AP uses POLL msg to allow sta to send messages) for WRT54G.</p><p>&nbsp; Since all these need an open source wireless driver and firmware, I am wondering if OpenWrt can do it. In the linksys firmware GPL distribution, all wireless drivers are binaries. Please kindly let me know.</p><p>&nbsp; Thanks in advance. </p><p>cheers,<br />--ken</p>									</div>

					<p>The wireless driver on the wrt is not open source.&nbsp; it is provided as binary by linksys/broadcom.</p><p>If you&#039;re willing to consider another platform, you might look at <a href="http://www.routerboard.com">http://www.routerboard.com</a>/ and put whatever minipci card has the drivers you want in.</p>									</div>
