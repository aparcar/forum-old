					<p>Hi,<br />We are building a social WIFI network in our city and are working on figures for costings etc.<br />To help me to predict more accurately how many nodes we will need to rollout I could do with knowing how many associated clients a typical installation would support.</p><p>We are using ADI Pronghorn Metro SBC with Ubiquiti XR5 for backhaul and Atheros CM9 for local access.</p><p>Any info would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Adyb</p>									</div>

					<p>Strictly the maximum is only a setting in the radio firmware. The practical limit depends on the quality of the connections and in the control over the clients that you have. The reasons:<br />best performance is when the data rate of all users is highest (54 Mbps) but this requires strong signals. When the central distribution uses legal power into an omni-directional antenna such strong signals can only be obtained with directional outdoor/roof antennas at the clients.&nbsp; Wit lesser signal and thus a poorer signal to noise ratio the units will automatically switch to lower data rate and so will need longer duration packets for the same amount of data. <br />Ideally all connections have to be good; one&nbsp; bad connection can spoil performance for many others as it tends to become a disturbing factor taking lots of time to transmit something, time during which the channel is unavailable for others.<br />The level of control is important to be able to set the CTS/RTS procedure in which, prior to a client sending data it asks and gets permission. It does ask permission using special short duration packets. Without this procedure clients that do not &#039;hear&#039; each other would often send at the same time which reduces the capacity for the access point to receive it first time right; the phenomenon is called &#039;hidden node&#039; problem.<br />So we use in our networks always a client unit that is not controlled by the user but managed by the network and can be guaranteed to have the proper settings and a good quality radio link, i.e. outdoor antenna and client unit are close to each other not to have coax cable losses and after that another in-house wireless router can take care of the in-house connectivity.<br />The above applies specifically to a star network topology (multitude of clients connect to a central access point) but the importance of good radio signal quality is always an important factor.<br />Hope this helps a bit in tackling the analysis.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>doddel</strong> on 18 May 2009, 21:24)</p>
