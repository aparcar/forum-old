					<p>Would some kind soul tell me how to determine this?</p><p>I&#039;d like to run ulogd on White Russion/RC5, and I&#039;m getting these errors when I do:</p><p>ipulog_read == -1! ipulog_errno == 7, errno = 132</p><p>From /usr/src/linux-2.6.12/include/asm-mips/errno.h:</p><p>#define ENOBUFS&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;132&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/* No buffer space available */</p><p>I realize the OpenWrt firmware runs 2.4.30 and not 2.6.12, but I guessed that these numbers remained the same.</p><p>And I found this with google:</p><p><a href="https://lists.gnumonks.org/pipermail/ulogd/2003-May/000308.html">https://lists.gnumonks.org/pipermail/ul â€¦ 00308.html</a></p><p>which seems to address my problem too (though the errno is different, the ENOBUFS is the same)</p><p>So rather than just going with the defaults from ulogd.conf, I thought I would adjust them to fit the OpenWrt firmware (in case it&#039;s different than a stock kernel) or at least figure out what these numbers are for the OpenWrt firmware before adjusting /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_*</p><p>Thanks for any replies.</p><p>John</p>									</div>

					<p>For anyone else who might be interested in this issue (and tho this might have been the hard way to answer the question) I checked out the sources for whiterussion with svn and built the firmware myself, thus getting a copy of the kernel sources.&nbsp; From there, I checked ipt_ULOG.c and found the answer to be 4096.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry for asking half a year later: 4096 was the answer, but did it solve the problem? If I set rmem=4096 in ulogd.conf, I get a TON of these errno=132 messages, a lot more than with the standard settings. My router hangs after a few minutes or hours an I can only unplug the power cable.</p>									</div>
