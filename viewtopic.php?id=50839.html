					<p>Hi,</p><p>I like to be able to enable the wifi accesspoint via wifi (and maybe an url). The goal is to minimize the wifi radiation. I know there are scripts to turn wifi off at night ( <a href="http://moething.mo.funpic.de/?p=59">http://moething.mo.funpic.de/?p=59</a> ). Instead I want the access point to just turn off when not in use and then when it gets triggered by some kind of special packaged emitted via wifi or an internal or external url request on the router turn it back on. I saw there is a monitor mode that the wifi can be put in so it does not transmit. Maybe that can be used to scan for a special package.</p><p>Anybody knows if something like this is already created?</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t know about special packet, but quite easy solution came to my mind. If you have smart phone, you can turn it into ap (tethering). Then you can scan on openwrt for nearby wireless networks in a loop using<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iwinfo wlan0 scanning | grep &quot;yourphonessid&quot;</code></pre></div><p>If openwrt will see your network, it can enable wifi. Scanning should work in monitor mode too.</p>									</div>

					<p>sounds clever. I get an error with the command you supplied:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># iwinfo

					<p>Given most Wifi devices don&#039;t support or use dynamic transmission power, a client &quot;looking&quot; for a hidden SSID does not have any effect on any other stations in range. Not only that, a client &quot;looking&quot; for a hidden SSID doesn&#039;t behave any differently from any other client &quot;looking&quot; for a non-hidden SSID (unless it&#039;s a mobile phone with various non-standard power saving hacks). There would still be no reason whatsoever for any other clients to &quot;bump up their transmission power&quot;, ignoring the fact the vast majority always transmit at maximum power all the time anyway.</p><p>No, the point is the only &quot;wifi radiation&quot; the AP is generating when no clients are connected is the beacon packets that broadcast the SSID. Turn off said beacons and it therefore has nothing to transmit. A wifi device that has no data to transmit generates no RF radiation.</p>									</div>

Most clients don&#039;t even have an attribute to store whether an SSID in their list is &quot;hidden&quot; or not. Access points will only respond to probe requests for *their* SSID, and as I say clients will probe for *all* known/saved SSIDs so they would have responded anyway.</p><p>Although perhaps there&#039;s an alternative scenario, where the known SSID is in range and broadcasting, where a client won&#039;t probe for it if it already sees it in a passive scan. In that case what you say might be true, but the client will still broadcast probes for every other SSID it&#039;s ever connected to that is <em>not</em> in range.</p><p>And I totally agree about the radiation thing, I&#039;m just entertaining the OP who obviously has a different opinion.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>qasdfdsaq</strong> on 4 Jun 2014, 18:13)</p>
