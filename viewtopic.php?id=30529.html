					<p>As above, I&#039;m trying at the moment to see if I can dump the firmware/CFE/everything else out, so in case I mess something up while playing with it I can restore stuff back. </p><p>A little bit of info, this thing is a router + 3G thing. The hardware is built on 2 seperate boards, the lower carrying the 3G/Radio stuff, and the upper carrying the router, which has a BCM5354 CPU. </p><p>I&#039;ve located what looks like the Jtag connector on the topside of the board, however it doesn&#039;t look like it conforms to anything I&#039;ve seen so far. I&#039;ve done a little bit of probing and made some educated guesse as to what each pin does, however hooking it up and trying tjtag on it doesn&#039;t work. </p><p>What looks like the Jtag points are in a 2x5 header. Here&#039;s what I think I&#039;ve figured out. <br />Pin 1 (top left) one of the RST pins (it&#039;s currently pulled down by a resistor just beside it). <br />Pin 2 (top right) GND <br />Pin 3 TDO, I&#039;m measuring a high impedance to both GND and Vcc. <br />Pin 4 Vref/Vcc, power comes in here through a small value (33ohm) resistor). <br />Pin 5 TDI,TCK or TMS. <br />Pin 6 NC <br />Pin 7 another RST pin, also pulled down, not sure which is the TRST though. <br />Pin 8 TDI, TCK or TMS. <br />Pin 9 TDI, TCK or TMS. <br />Pin 10 GND </p><p>I&#039;ve tried all possible combinations of hooking up TDI, TCK and TMS, and alternately pulling up both RST pins, but until now still no joy. Perhaps some1 else might have a better idea as to what to try next. I do have telnet access if that&#039;s important. </p><p>I have more pictures of the otherside of the PCB if anyone needs it. I&#039;m just wondering if I&#039;m chasing up the wrong tree and the Jtag points are just gone or elsewhere. Perhaps someone with more insight can shine some light on this. </p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i54.tinypic.com/116o11i.jpg" alt="http://i54.tinypic.com/116o11i.jpg" /></span></p>									</div>
