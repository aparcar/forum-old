					<p>I have been trying to flash WL500g Premium in Ubuntu 7.04 with the openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx firmware downloaded here from here <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/newest/default">http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussi â€¦ st/default</a>.</p><p>I am doing everything accordingly to instruction:<br />1. unplug the power<br />2. press the reset and plug the power<br />3. hold reset for a while<br />4. the power led start flashing which means device in flashing mode.</p><p>Router is just taken out of the box, all settings are default, but at this point i can&#039;t ping 192.168.1.1. Or it is totally impossible due to flashing mode?</p><p>Then i use atftp as follows:</p><p>connect 192.168.1.1<br />mode octet<br />trace<br />timeout 1<br />openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx</p><p>And get timeout error. Looks like atftp (as well as aftp) can not see the device.</p><p>Then i booted to windows, switched router to flashing mode and then used ASUS firmware recovery tool. Voila! Everithing worked. </p><p>Again i booted linux and tried to reflash with atftp - no success.</p><p>Thus, the question what is the problem in linux?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p><p>P.S. I found a problem, while flashing you should connect asus via wan port, not via lan1.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>geragray</strong> on 30 Jul 2007, 09:24)</p>

					<p>In Linux you get a default IP depending on your ethernet driver. This usually puts you in a different subnet than the router is in and thus you are unable to reach the router because your NIC can&#039;t navigate to the router.</p><p>To remedy this just enter:</p><p>ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.100</p>									</div>
