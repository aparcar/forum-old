					<p>Hey folks, </p><p>Having a bit of a problem with my WRT54G.. i reflashed to the OpenWRT firmware, and now i am unable to log into/telnet into my router.&nbsp; When it is not connected to the internet, it will give me a 192.168.1.12x IP with a default gateway of 192.168.1.1.&nbsp; Unable to log in via web (no response) or telnet (no response).&nbsp; The kicker is that when I plug the router into the internet, it will act like a switch and simply pass the public IP directly to my PC.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried holding the reset button down, but that doesn&#039;t seem to do anything anymore.&nbsp; The WLAN will also give me a 192.168.1.12x ip address, and i cannot log in nor telnet thru the WLAN.&nbsp; It will NOT pass the public IP through the WLAN, only hardwired.&nbsp; If anyone could help me that would be great!!</p><p>thanks you!</p><p>Dennis</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I flashed my WRT54G at home with WhiteRussian 9, and it is working fine.&nbsp; Have you tried to ssh into it, or are you only using telnet? </p><p>ssh -l root 192.168.1.1</p><p>should give you a password prompt, but if you have not set the password yet you can&#039;t log in.&nbsp; To do this, goto your browser and type</p><p>192.168.1.1</p><p>it should open up the OpenWRT admin console.&nbsp; If it doesn&#039;t, than you probably don&#039;t have access via port 80 to the admin console.&nbsp; Try 81.&nbsp; If that doesn&#039;t work, re-flashing the box would be best.&nbsp; There are numerous articles regarding how to &#039;un-brick&#039; your box, and I believe there are ways to set the device back to its factory defaults.&nbsp; </p><p>Also, pressing the reset button doesn&#039;t do much besides mess things up further in my experience.</p>									</div>
