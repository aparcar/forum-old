					<p>Hi all,</p><p>After a lot of fiddling around with my stock WL-500gP (broadcom 43xx troubles, stuck to kernel 2.4)&nbsp; I changed the mini-pci to a Gigabyte WL01HT.</p><p>Guess what? The Kamikaze brcm47xx-2.6 works like a charm. No troubles at all.</p><p>Even aircrack-ng hops channels now (couldn&#039;t get that working with the wl and wl-mimo drivers for broadcom).</p><p>SO: TOGETHER WITH A MADWIFI SUPPORTED CHIPSET THE WL-500GP makes a GREAT BOX.</p><p>I guess other Atheros mini-pci cards should work as well, as long as they are Madwifi supported.</p><p>Just wanted to let all the WL-500gP owners know.</p><p>cheers,</p><p>Arjan</p>									</div>

					<p>Byt the way: I did also try an Askey AR5BMB5 (based on which Atheros chipset??) and although it works (I tried airodump-ng), it seems to be MUCH less sensitive than the Gigabyte GN-Wl01HT. </p><p>Comparison: The AR5BMB5 saw 5 acces points, the GN saw 18 !!</p>									</div>

					<p>Kwarre,</p><p>I&#039;ve been trying to do what you have accomplished with the AR5006SX card in the WL500gP. I installed the Atheros card and loaded the Kamikaze 7.06 Broadcom 2.6 trx image and it seemed to install ok, the dmesg shows both the 11.a and 11.g is found--all the speeds available for both formats were listed. But when I ran iwconfig no wireless ports were listed. </p><p>Did you have to load any packages to get it to work? Is there something else I have to do so iwconfig will see the wlan interfaces? Is the 11.a interface working for you?</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>Rob Robinette<br />robinette@comcast.net</p>									</div>

					<p>I got my Atheros AR5006X based Compex mini-pci card working in the WL500gP with Kami 7.06 Broadcom 47xx 2.6 trx installed. Very sweet. Both the A and G channels are available for selection and work, but you can only run A or G, not both simultaneously.</p><p>The correct madwifi drivers are already installed with the base 47xx 2.6 trx Kamikaze image. My problem above was caused by not using the madwifi configuration programs properly to initialize the card. Webif2 correctly identified the Atheros chip and offered up a configuration that included the A and G channels.</p><p>So all you have to do to get Kamikaze running is swap the radio cards, flash the Kamikaze 7.06 Broadcom 47xx 2.6 (not 2.4) trx file, telnet in and change the password, ssh in and run &quot;ipkg install webif&quot;, then configure the router using the Webif2 web interface.</p><p>Rob</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>robrob</strong> on 8 Jul 2007, 04:16)</p>

					<p>Of course, just when one cried for help in a forum because he was unable to<br />find the information he desperately seeked, the fairy godmother appears and<br />solves the problem.&nbsp; ;-))<br />I finally found by accident a review of the WL-500gP which described the<br />disassembly (open up) of the case.<br />To help the next &quot;seeker&quot; here is the description:<br />Remove the glued rubber feeds on the bottom of the router and you will find<br />four screws. One of them will be covered by a warranty seal.<br />Remove all four and the upper and lower part of the case can be separated.</p><p>Cheers</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>kenatopenwrt wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Can someone give me an advise how to disassemble the<br />WL-500gP?<br />I wasn&#039;t able to find an instruction on the net.<br />I would like to exchange the WLAN-mini-PCI too, but<br />failed to find a way to open the case without risking<br />to make an irreversible damage. :-((<br />Thanks in advance.</p><p>Regards<br />Karsten</p></blockquote></div>									</div>
