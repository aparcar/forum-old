					<p>Hi All</p><p>I am working for a company that works with wifi sharing.</p><p>We have purchased 3 samples routers from a Chinese company that is suppose to be able to run OpenWRT, we found that is was true with a twist. They run Pandora and can only use packages from openwrt.org.cn. And it don&#039;t seems like we can build our won version with source from openwrt.org, which we need to be able to do.</p><p>We found the router company on alibaba.com and I am wondering if any of you have had experience with this issue. Can you find routers on alibaba that supports real openwrt. Have you order routers from a good company that works in a good way with openwrt and what did you pay?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Squonk</p><p>Sorry to ask you so much, hope it is ok.</p><p>I am writing some new manufactures regarding buying some samples. I have written this to them, I want to ensure that they do it right this time.</p><p>What do you think is it clear enough and are things missing? I am not completely sure I use the right terms and explanations.</p><br /><p>--------------</p><p>We are looking for a router where we can put our own openwrt build on. So it i important that we can build our version from openwrt.org source directly. To ensure all intellectual properties rights is supported. So the source for a openwrt build must not come from openwrt.org.cn.</p><p>The router must be installed with openwrt from the beginning. The version must be supplied to us as a binary and you must supply us with instructions for the build process that resulted in that binary. Further more we need to .config file for the build process and hardware descriptions for all hardware within the router.</p><p>All of the above must be supplied before any order samples or production routers will be ordered. </p><br /><br /><p>Minimum spec requirements for the router:<br />---------<br />- CPU: the platform must support standard OpenWRT (openwrt.org) no source must be included from openwrt.org.cn.<br />- Could be Atheros AR9331 or Ralink RT5350 series or others.</p><p>- FLASH: minimum 8M <br />- SDRAM: minimum 32M<br />- 150 mbps<br />- min. 1 x WAN port<br />- Wireless 802.11n<br />- Dual band</p><br /><p>Other requirements<br />----------<br />- Every router must be individually RF-calibrated<br />- Every router have a global unique mac address<br />- Opportunity to have logo on router and product box.&nbsp; <br />- CE/FCC/IC/RoHS certification must be proved by scanning it and sending it by email.</p>									</div>

					<p>I am not very familiar with building my own linux kernel, so I figured that if I can get the .config file this can help me big time when I need to build my own, and perhaps I can figure out if it can be build with standard openwrt. </p><p>Would that be an approach, what would you guys do. I can see that when a new router comes along you post a message in this forum and you dive in, helping with building openwrt for the router. How do you figure out what modules and packages you need for the router, do you get some kind of log form the device so you can figure it out or?</p><p>Again, sorry I am very newbie to routers and openwrt.</p>									</div>

					<p>Utah, I am in China these days. I will be flying out next week.&nbsp; China is nothing like the US. Its not like you can go on to the internet and find exactly what you are looking for.&nbsp; Things change in China on the fly. The specification, the price, the delivery, nothing is constant, or exactly as advertised most of the time. I have a company in China and one in the US. I have Chinese staff who help me do the digging. If you are interested in getting some thing which will work good for you, feel free to contact me before I fly out. I will return to China, but that would be after one month.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ron</strong> on 6 May 2014, 19:17)</p>
