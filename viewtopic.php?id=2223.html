					<p>Hi,</p><p>I, with a very experienced hardware-oriented partner,&nbsp; have turned a Motorola <br />WR850Gv3 into a brick.&nbsp; We closely followed the instructions at </p><p><a href="http://openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Installing#head-16e8d1f9495b84660425ea230a05e0305b71bdd1">http://openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Installi … 305b71bdd1</a></p><p>After uploading openwrt-motorola-jffs2-8MB.trx using the original firmware&#039;s admin page,<br />the browser said upload complete and we power-cycled it.&nbsp; The Power LED came up red and<br />the unit was unresponsive.</p><p>We then tried to &quot;debrick&quot; following the instructions in </p><p><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=2048">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=2048</a>.</p><p>Note the flash memory chip in this unit is NOT &quot;Intel&quot;, but &quot;MX&quot;, but we followed the <br />same instructions.&nbsp; After many connection timeouts with tftp we managed, with a <br />pushpin, to get a &quot;Transfer successful&quot; and waited 60s.&nbsp; We powered it off and on, <br />and again got a red Power LED.&nbsp; It responded to ping but not telnet.&nbsp; It reports its<br />MAC address.&nbsp; At this point the unit is always in tftp receive mode (no needle <br />necessary) and we can upload easily, but always get the same results (red LED,<br />no telnet), even with Motorola firmware.</p><p>Is it ruined?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Glenn</p>									</div>

					<p>By way of follow-up to my own post.&nbsp; &nbsp;Suspecting that trying to short then<br />pins on the flash chip may have damaged them, I looked at them with<br />a magnifying glass and tried to scratch out any debris between them<br />with a needle.&nbsp; &nbsp;They look OK in that they don&#039;t touch each other and<br />are unbroken.&nbsp; &nbsp;My thinking was that after transferring the firmware that<br />it could not be loaded into flash because of shorted pins.&nbsp; However,<br />this had no effect on the problem:&nbsp; I still get a red Power LED and no<br />telnet.</p><p>While I only have one data point, it seem that attempting to load <br />OpenWRT WhiteRussianRC2 on a Motorola WR850G is a risky thing---<br />fair warning.</p><p>Cheers,<br />Glenn</p>									</div>

					<p>If you are trying to flash RC2 again after an unsuccessful flash, OpenWRT doesn&#039;t reformat the jffs2 partitions, so there may be some unusable sections of code on the flash.&nbsp; You will have to reflash with the orginal Motorola firmware MINUS the bytes before the &quot;HDR0&quot; in the file (use a Hex edit to remove these and save the file).&nbsp; &nbsp;This is important!&nbsp; The router will sit in a TFTP loop if you don&#039;t remove these bytes.</p><p>Using the Motorola firmware &quot;reformats&quot; the flash from an unseccessful OpenWRT flash.&nbsp; If you are still unsuccessful after doing this, the next step would be to wire up a JTAG connector and erase the flash NVRAM and KERNEL sections before flashing with the Motorola or OpenWRT firmware.</p><p>kbj</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey,</p><p>You guys are great.&nbsp; I downloaded a hex editor (khexedit), which showed the<br />HRD0 on the first line (values 48 44 52 30, eight hex pairs from the beginning).<br />I put the cursor at the beginning, hit Delete eight times, and saved it under a<br />new name.</p><p>I then did the tftp, binary mode, to 192.168.10.1, and put the modified file in.<br />It blinked a lot while uploading, as usual, for about 9 seconds, after which I<br />got the &quot;Sent 3076096 bytes in 9.2 seconds&quot; message.&nbsp; I waited patiently,<br />and about forty seconds later it seemed to reboot itself, and I saw a green<br />Power LED for the first time in a while.&nbsp; I power-cycled it 30 seconds later.<br />Note it did not respond to pings or browser until I held the reset button down<br />for 7 seconds, but at that point it responded to pings and I could browse to<br />the admin pages.</p><p>Thank you very much!</p><p>Now, my plan was to use this router as an access point with OpenWrt, (if<br />access point is the right word---I want it to receive wireless signals and<br />be able to plug into its ethernet ports to get wired internet access). </p><p>I&#039;m a little leery now.&nbsp; Is there something missing from the instructions at</p><p><a href="http://openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Installing#head-16e8d1f9495b84660425ea230a05e0305b71bdd1">http://openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Installi … 305b71bdd1</a></p><p>after all, I followed the carefully, with a competent partner.&nbsp; The only thing I<br />can think of is that while following those instructions, we power-cycled the <br />router when the web page said the installation was complete, which was<br />not as long as 45 seconds, as I recall, more like ten or twenty.&nbsp; </p><p>Could that have been the problem?</p><p>Do I need to use an edited OpenWRT firmware file to do this right?</p><p>Was openwrt-motorola-jffs2-8MB.trx (renamed from .bin) the right file to use?</p><p>When we flashed originally, the router&#039;s WAN address was a <br />local fixed address with netmask 255.255.192.0---could that <br />have messed things up?&nbsp; After restoring the firmware I was <br />surprised that it still remembered that WAN address on the <br />Internet/Basic admin page.</p><br /><p>Cheers,<br />Glenn</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi there again.<br />File you&#039;ve used should be ok, but I actually used the squashfs version. Now, if you upload the file using<br />original &quot;Firmware Update&quot; option in motorola&#039;s web interface , you&nbsp; should use the file you&#039;ve downloaded from <br />openwrt and not the edited one.Edited version is for TFTP or the second method I&#039;ve described before.<br />Also , that is normal that your router &quot;recalled&quot; some parameters.There is such thing as NVRAM that stores some variables, and that is why , after going back to original firmware few things were &quot;restored&quot; from NVRAM.<br />Anyway , before flashing your router again, you should use the advice and define it as 192.168.1.1 / 255.255.255.0 . Now , I don&#039;t know if you already got it, but that firmware doesn&#039;t have web interface, so you really should think twice before switching to openwrt. It was actually hard for me to start working with it, due to lack of<br />knowledge in Linux and so on...But the choice is yours.<br />Good Luck,<br />Fox Mulder.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Fox,</p><p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty confident that OpenWrt has the features<br />I&#039;d like, and I&#039;m comfortable with a command line interface.&nbsp; My only<br />problem is that I&#039;m having trouble getting it installed.&nbsp; I&#039;m not at all<br />clear as to why my first attempt failed.&nbsp; Is there some reason I may<br />have better luck with the squashfs?&nbsp; </p><p>Cheers,<br />Glenn</p>									</div>

					<p>Well , for me it is pretty simple : I had no problems with squashfs on my Motorola while you had problems with jffs2. So IMO squashfs should work fine for you also.That is what I am thinking of.BTW , I passed to openwrt exactly as described in the link you posted above, using motorola&#039;s &quot;Firmware Update&quot; web interface.Later, when I had to go back to motorola&#039;s firmware I found out that changes have to be done to files in order to do that, but you already have both versions you might need.Also , some motorola owners run the general brcm-openwrt version on their router, but the reason they took it , as I know, was the fact that it was only version that worked through TFTP without editing it. I explained that in my post , if you recall. Well , if you have more questions that I can answer on , I&#039;ll be happy to help.<br />Best regards,<br />Fox Mulder.</p>									</div>
