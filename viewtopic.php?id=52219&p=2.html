					<p>AFAIK&nbsp; building a package goes like this:<br />1. downloading vanila source of package from upstream, untar it.<br />2. downloading OpenWRT specifik patches, untar, apply them (if they are needed)<br />3. compiling the package and making .ipk <br />4. add package to local feed index<br />All this needs working building enviroment.<br />Somwhere in that build enviroment there have to be instructions for this steps.
