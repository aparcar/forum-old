					<p>Hi, I recently compiled my own version of 12.09 AA in order to include some patches that were not in the current build, but I have a few questions and problems so far.</p><p>I have successfully compiled and flashed a copy of my compiled ax71xx generic firmware for the wr703n target, but I have a few problems with packages. I noticed that when I tried to `opkg update` that there was no 12.09.1 package repository and I&#039;ve read online that you can switch it to the normal 12.09 package repository and it should work. So trying this I edited the `/etc/opkg.conf` file to change the repo directory to 12.09 and I updated fine, but when I tried to install packages I get `satisfy_dependencies_for` errors:</p><p> </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# opkg install kmod-fs-ext4 kmod-usb-storage

 * opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package kmod-usb-storage.</code></pre></div><p>I did some reading and this is because the kmod packages were not compiled for this newer kernel so they fail to install.</p><p>So my question is, how do you compile your own packages to use with the 12.09.1 AA r40431 openwrt for use on the tplink wr703n router.</p><p>Also when compiling openwrt I was a bit confused about the feeds and `base system` menu in `make menuconfig`. If someone could explain those to me as well I would love it (is there any settings or anything I should set for the wr703n other than the target profile?).</p><p>Also will I get this error for every package or just kernel packages? Should I just compile every package myself and setup my own repository (me and a group of people need working packages), if so how can I go about compiling all the&nbsp; packages/kernel modules and put them into a repo. Also note, I don&#039;t want to have the kernel modules or packages built into the firmware as the wr703n has limited space.</p><p>Thank you for any help!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>abduct</strong> on 13 May 2014, 02:40)</p>

I finally fixed a long standing problem with my usb hub (kept resetting/erroring and freezing the router) because of a patch in AA that was not compiled into the version on the website. Only thing stopping me was this error and now that I compiled the modules in everything thing works fine.</p><p>Thanks again.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>abduct</strong> on 13 May 2014, 20:14)</p>

					<p>Decided to post here instead of making a new thread. I successfully have everything setup, except the firmware/drivers for my second wireless adapter (2800rt) are not being loaded at boot. The symptoms are similar to this problem: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/8789">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/8789</a></p><p>When booting my dmesg shows the adapter in my 4 port hub as well as my thumb drive, and my config is filled out correctly (both radios are filled out and enabled), but when i issue a ifconfig command only my wlan0 main radio shows up, not my secondary one plugged in through the hub. Although when I attempt to use the device (say to change its mode) I get the message </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>phy0 -&gt; rt2x00lib_request_firmware: Info - Loading firmware file &#039;rt2870.bin&#039;.</code></pre></div><p>and it successfully loads and I have full access to the interface (it shows up in ifconfig and everywhere else). Is there a reason why this is not happening automatically or is there a way for this to happen by itself at boot?</p><p>Thanks again.</p><p>Edit:: more info</p><p>As you can see here in the dmesg that it detects it plugged into the hub during boot, but I cant see the interface in iwconfig nor ifconfig</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[   29.660000] usb 1-1.3: reset high-speed USB device number 4 using ehci-platform

If you use the default config generated from `wifi detect` it names the interfaces radio0, radio1. Renaming them to wlan0 and wlan1 fixed this issue and loaded the firmware at boot/</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>abduct</strong> on 14 May 2014, 10:07)</p>
