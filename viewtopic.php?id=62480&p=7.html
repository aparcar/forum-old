A simple hexdump -C /dev/mtdblockN where mtdblockN is the soft_config partition should be able to tell. It will also tell what is the &quot;normal&quot; value (hopefully it&#039;ll be 0x10).</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Just wonted to pop by and say that i have a RB750 r2 (hEX lite) and is working lovely with LEDE snapshot build at the moment, I have tryed the stable LEDE 17.01.1 but no joy on this as it gived me non-working LAN ports!</p><p>At the moment the LEDE snapshot builds shows the <strong>USR</strong> LED is flashing away, Anyone eles have the same issue on other models? or is it becouse i still have it running in the RAM? (initramfs)</p><p><strong>Edit:</strong><br />I have decided to go for the sysupgrade bit, However i get this error but i waited for about 1 min and then i see the LEDs at the top come back on so i have no idea what went on? So would anyone recommend me to do a &quot;mtd erase firmware&quot; and then sysupgrade lede-ar71xx-mikrotik-rb-nor-flash-16M-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin etc?</p><p>I have unplugged my RB750 r2 heX lte from the power and back on again so is definitely stored, Installed LuCI fine no issues.</p><p>Reboot (SNAPSHOT, r4049-9412fc2) the snapshot build dated 27/04/2017</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@LEDE:/tmp# sysupgrade lede-ar71xx-mikrotik-rb-nor-flash-16M-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin
