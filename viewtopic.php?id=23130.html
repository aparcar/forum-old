					<p>I see, had to read the post more closely. The wifi interface is bridged with the LAN, therefore you never get to layer 3 as everything stays in layer 2. The switch will read that it is multicast traffic and just do the forwarding itself. You will need to use ebtables to filter this traffic I believe.</p>									</div>

Do you mean to remove the bridge between the wifi and LAN segments? If so, then yes, I believe that would work in order to filter this traffic but as you said, it brings up other concerns he needs to be aware of.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have another idea, why not reconfigure how switching works? That is, by using vlans, you can separate the port on which you connect your ip-tv from the rest of your lan ports. Say for example, assuming a 4-lanport router, you set ports 1-3 as VLAN1, then set port 4 and 5 (the internet/wan port), as VLAN2. The you connect your ip-tv at port 4 so that it is separated from your lan. What do you think of this workaround?</p><p>Of course the port numbers vary with different hardware, Mine for example has ports 0-3 as lan ports 1-4, port 4 as wan port, and port 5 as the internal, hardwired port, for a total of 6 ports on a 4-lanport router. And do not forget to include the internal, hardwired port of your switch on each when defining vlans.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>braveheartleo</strong> on 25 Jan 2010, 14:53)</p>

					<p>It looks you are using the router as a switch and AP, and the multicast traffic floods your wireless interface.<br />Multicast is different from broadcast, as it is only intended for subscribing hosts. Unfortunately, any switch that doesn&#039;t implement IGMP snooping doesn&#039;t know who wants multicast, so will handle it like broadcast.</p><p>The ideal solution is to implement IGMP snooping. I don&#039;t know how to do that.<br />A working solution is to filter multicast traffic being sent to the wifi interface.</p><p>1 - Install ebtables:</p><p>opkg update<br />opkg install ebtables</p><p>note 1: if you are using the router as a switch, you will need to add config option gateway and config list dns to the LAN interface configuration to gain internet connectivity.<br />note 2: installing kernel modules with packages doesn&#039;t work every time. If your router doesn&#039;t boot anymore, please compile OpenWRT with ebtables built-in.</p><p>2 - Add rules:</p><p>Edit /etc/firewall.user and add:</p><p>ebtables -A FORWARD -o wlan0 -d Multicast -j DROP # drop multicast traffic coming from another interface to wlan0(WIFI)</p><p>If this doesn&#039;t work as you wish, you may try also this rules:</p><p>ebtables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -d Multicast -j DROP # drop multicast traffic coming from eth0(LAN) to any other bridged interface<br />ebtables -A INPUT -i eth0 -d Multicast -j DROP # drop multicast traffic coming from eth0(LAN) to the CPU</p><br /><p>Regards</p>									</div>
