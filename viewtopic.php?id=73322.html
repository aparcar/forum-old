					<p>You&#039;ll have to spend some time on the Linux command line for this. At the moment, it doesn&#039;t look as if anyone has written a LuCI plugin for slide-switch, so there&#039;s no pretty GUI to control it.</p><p>You don&#039;t need to use a Linux computer; your Windows computer will be fine. All you need is a method to get into the command line of the router. SSH is the most straightforward. An adequate - and free - SSH client is PuTTY. Once you&#039;re in, navigating the filesystem of the router is the same as any other Linux computer.</p>									</div>
