					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m hoping to find some help in this forum. I need to create a solution with an OpenWRT Firmware to measure the time a special user is in the internet (and limiting it).</p><p>This is for the little sister of my girlfriedn. She is nearly 9 hours per Day online... Their parents are not very happy about this. A simple &quot;No&quot; seems not to work.</p><p>So my question: How to create such a setup? I think the best would be to create a user for her on the OpenWRT and let her &quot;dail&quot; in using PPP. But how limit the used time? Any Hints? I&#039;m not a Linux beginner so the solution could be pretty complicated... But at the moment I have no Idea. :-/</p><p>Thanks for all helpfull thoughs</p><p>With best regards,<br />Stefan...</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I found an interesting patch in the netfilter&#039;s patch o matic package. What it does is :</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>This option adds CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_TIME, which supplies a time match module.<br />This match allows you to filter based on the packet arrival time/date<br />(arrival time/date at the machine which the netfilter is running on) or<br />departure time/date (for locally generated packets).</p><p>Supported options are:<br />[ --timestart value ]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Match only if it is after `value&#039; (Inclusive, format: HH:MM ; default 00:00).</p><p>[ --timestop&nbsp; value ]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Match only if it is before `value&#039; (Inclusive, format: HH:MM ; default 23:59).</p><p>[ --days listofdays ]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Match only if today is one of the given days. (format: Mon,Tue,Wed,Thu,Fri,Sat,Sun ; default everyday)</p><p>[ --datestart date ]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Match only if it is after `date&#039; (Inclusive, format: YYYY[:MM[:DD[:hh[:mm[:ss]]]]]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; h,m,s start from 0 ; default to 1970)</p><p>[ --datestop date ]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Match only if it is before `date&#039; (Inclusive, format: YYYY[:MM[:DD[:hh[:mm[:ss]]]]]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; h,m,s start from 0 ; default to 2037)</p><p>Example:<br />&nbsp; -A INPUT -m time --timestart 8:00 --timestop 18:00 --days Mon,Tue,Wed,Thu,Fri<br />&nbsp; will match packets that have an arrival timestamp in the range 8:00-&gt;18:00 from Monday<br />&nbsp; to Friday.</p><p>&nbsp; -A OUTPUT -m time --timestart 8:00 --timestop 18:00 --Days Mon --date-stop 2010<br />&nbsp; will match the packets (locally generated) that have a departure timestamp<br />&nbsp; in the range 8:00-&gt;18:00 on Monday only, until 2010</p></blockquote></div><p>I think it could be a simple solution to make this girl stop surfing <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> It just requires kernel patching and iptables patching, but if your familiar with linux it takes no time.</p><p>You can also define a static entry for her computer in /etc/dnsmasq.conf, and add a crontab denying all traffic coming from this host after n hour for instance.&nbsp; This is another solution, maybe easier than the previous one ?</p>									</div>

					<p>The easiest way would probably be to use a schedule.&nbsp; For example, from 3-6 in the evening, or something like that.&nbsp; You could then just use cron to add and remove access via the firewall...</p><p>Another idea would be to use the pptp server, and some shell scripts to count online time.&nbsp; Using cron to launch a &#039;counter&#039; script every five minutes, you could keep track of the amount of online time and limit it as necessary.&nbsp; The counter script could work by pinging the IP address assigned to the pptp account.&nbsp; </p><p>Could be a little tricky to get set up though...</p>									</div>

					<p>Hm... pptp and Shellscripts. Yes, this might work and it looks more flexible than the other solution since I can control the whole time stuff. Not only *when* she is online but also how long. The Cron solution seems not really accurate but it should be good enough. </p><p>Perhaps someone has some other ideas or perhaps know software which exactly does what I&#039;m searching for?</p>									</div>
