					<p>But this is with all 10 of my windows systems, what does openvpn do with the traffic ping and browse.. unless I know how it is routing the traffic it is hard to track it down and I cannot see in the firewall logs that anything is being blocked on the windows systems.. this seems to be a problem with openvpn and windows systems using a tune interface.&nbsp; My ppptp works fine and I can ping and communicate just fine when using that VPN so I know it is not the windows systems blocking imp and other traffic, it only has issues when I involve openvpn.

					<p>It does not do anything with the traffic whatsoever, it&#039;s simply routed over a layer 3 tunnel (TUN) and traverses the normal routing table at the router. If you see the ICMP at tun0 then you should also see an ARP request on br-lan followed by the ICMP request. There is absolutely no difference if the receiving end is a Linux machine, or if it&#039;s running Windows or OS/2 Warp for that matter. Did you not see the ICMP request on br-lan when doing tcpdump?</p><p>You are way too quick to draw conclusions, based on misinterpreting stuff you find on the web. Your PPTP tunnel, is it terminated at the OpenWRT router too? What IP range are the clients assigned to?</p><p>There are ways to turn on logging in the VPN/LAN zone if you so wish, but there is a default ACCEPT rule for the FORWARD chain so there should be no packet filter stopping you there.</p><p>I&#039;m sure people have all kinds of problems with the Windows firewall, but I assure you there is no incompatibility whatsoever with the VPN or the TUN interface. The packets are forwarded untouched.</p><p>Do you use static or DHCP assigned addresses on the Windows machine?</p><p>Keep in mind that I am using the same configuration as you, and I can connect fine to services on Linux, Mac OSX, I can control my Samsung TV and my Denon receiver through UPnP. TCP/IP is a standard, your issue can be solved 100%.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>arokh</strong> on 27 Jun 2014, 11:34)</p>

					<p>Hi mate, </p><p>Been using your firmware for a while. VPN works fine, unsure why the guys above are running into issues.</p><p>The only thing I have seen, which isn&#039;t a huge deal, but sort of annoying, is that IPv6 leases aren&#039;t showing up in the list any more.. (i.e. list of current IPv6 leases).</p><p>I tried an alternative OpenWRT firmware and found that the leases show fine in that.

					<p>Did you try with my 800MHz OC build? I got faster results than that but didn&#039;t do any extensive benchmarking. Remember that you&#039;re running an encrypted SSL tunnel with compression on a router with MIPS cpu. If you don&#039;t care about security you can disable encryption for the data traffic and probably get much better results as well.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>arokh</strong> on 27 Jun 2014, 21:01)</p>

					<p>@aarontnz</p><p>Yes, multicast should be working across VPN.

I tried with &quot;4000,6112&quot; as i tough it was this way but it seems i&#039;m wrong. (Maybe it&#039;s that way and possible, but the GUI don&#039;t allow it ?).
