					<p>Hi,&nbsp; I am new to Linux in general.&nbsp; I always wanted to get into it and found a practical project to help me do just that - turning a ASUS router into a Internet Radio Player.&nbsp; While the blog provides a final image of the Firmware to replace the stock version with, this would not let me learn anything about Linux or OpenWrt.&nbsp; SO, I installed Virtual Box on my iMac (OS X) and did a Net Install of the latest Debian Linux flavor.&nbsp; Installing Debian was easy.&nbsp; I then went to follow some setup docs for OpenWrt - not so easy.</p><p>My overall question:&nbsp; Is there a single document somewhere that lists the applications (and where/how to get them) to allow me to compile OpenWrt and customize its packages?&nbsp; &nbsp;It seems every time I follow a &quot;How To&quot;, not a single command works, I have to go searching the internet for hours to figure out how to make a single command work.</p><p>Current problem 1:&nbsp; Make prereq command does not work.&nbsp; I get a No Rule error</p><p>Current problem 2:&nbsp; Cannot get ./scripts/feeds command to work.&nbsp; Bash: ./Scripts/Feeds: No such file or directory</p><p>Any help would be great, Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I don&#039;t want to teach you how to suck eggs or anything, but if you are completely new maybe you didn&#039;t spot that ./Scripts/Feeds is not the same in the Linux world as ./scripts/feeds</p><p>Also, the significance of the . is that it will execute in the current directory, so if you are in /home/test it will execute /home/test/scripts/feeds</p><p>I hope it helps a little.</p><p>Best regards,<br />P</p>									</div>
