					<p>Hello,</p><p>So my router was working fine with a repeater and all set up.&nbsp; Then I tried to get the LAN side and WiFi side to commune both ways across each. Then in a fit of stupidity I bridged the WiFi to the LAN and the LAN to the WiFi.&nbsp; As I have ended up with no usable router I have a horrid feeling that I have sort of bricked it.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>									</div>

					<p>So I have been trying to learn this darn TFTP thing. so say I can do a reflash via TFTP via lan.</p><p>Buffalo WZR-HP-G450H</p><p>TFTP Recovery<br />To perform a TFTP recovery on this model: <br />• Set your IP address to 192.168.11.2<br />• Set a static arp entry for 192.168.11.1 to 02:aa:bb:cc:dd:23<br />• TFTP the image during the 4 second window and wait</p><p>So I set the IP to static. I found out how to set the arp (arp -s 192.168.11.2 02:aa:bb:cc:dd:23, incase your curious). Then I tried to hook up a switch incase the lan was shutting off and then taking to long to come back up. I have sat for the better part of 2 hours trying to complete 3 steps as above.&nbsp; I am happy to flash the firmware again.&nbsp; Any pointers, it should not be this hard.</p>									</div>

					<p>Unless you have two flashing red lights why not just reset your config to defaults and not a firmware flash?</p><p>Look for the reset button on the bottom of the router.&nbsp; You usually need a pen to push it in.</p>									</div>

					<p>This doesn&#039;t appear to work. I have tried to hold the rest button for 10 seconds. I have also tried the 30 second hold release pull the power 30 second hold release power in 30 second hold. All of which does nothing.&nbsp; Unless the reset button is a different button to what is labelled.</p>									</div>
