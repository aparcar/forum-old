					<p>Hello all,</p><p>I just got a tenda w302r, searched a lot but can&#039;t find much of anything related to openwrt and this particular model of tenda. I should note that I&#039;m fine bricking it, but if I MUST brick it, I&#039;d like to brick it with the firmware version most likely to work. Hints? Pointers? Although I&#039;m not too comfy opening the device, if it would greatly help, let me know what I should do <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>This page has some specs regarding the w302r</p><p><a href="http://www.tenda.cn/tendacn/product/show.aspx?productid=277&amp;type=1">http://www.tenda.cn/tendacn/product/sho â€¦ amp;type=1</a></p><p>Appreciate the help!</p>									</div>

					<p>well here goes...</p><p>first off<br />1)no you should not be flashing those image as of now... and if you mean by flashing putting a file in the firmware update in webpage then hell no....<br />reason<br />because these image are not specific to your router </p><p>2)what you should do know is find out what bootloader your running on this device and attempt to connect to it from there you should start with the images listed in openwrt<br />start by hooking up a serial console to you router google uart </p><p>3)yeah normally the flash rom of a router is divided into partitions. typically the end or last partitions are important as they contain important data related to the router wireless config </p><p>what i would like to impress upon you is chances of brick by doing something stupid seems relatively high now as this seems to be undoucumted in openwrt </p><p>i would suggest you to read all you can about linux and bootloader (uboot in you case i think don&#039;t take my word for it)</p>									</div>
