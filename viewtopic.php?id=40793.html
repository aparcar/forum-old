					<p>I&#039;m evaluating a WZR-HP-G450H which came with DD-WRT installed, and of course I want to switch to OpenWRT. However, the web based GUI fails to download any of the bin files - both ones I compiled my self and also the pre-built &quot;openwrt-ar71xx-generic-wzr-hp-g450h-squashfs-factory.bin&quot; file form the OpenWRT. </p><p>I&#039;ve found instructions for downloading with TFTP, but no mention of why the GUI wouldn&#039;t work. The Wiki page has serial port recovery instructions, but again; no mention of an initial installation:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr-hp-g450h">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr-hp-g450h</a></p><p>I may want to flash a hundred or so of these - am I really condemned to doing it with TFTP?</p>									</div>

					<p>I think you can always flash them with mtd from DD-WRT command line, similar to <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr-hp-g300h#migrate.from.dd-wrt.to.openwrt">here</a>.</p>									</div>
