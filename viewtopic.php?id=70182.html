					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am trying to get Time Machine to work with a network drive, so I am following the instructions from this page:</p><p><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/timemachine">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/timemachine</a></p><p>I get to the part where it says to install netatalk, which it seems to do succesfully:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>...
Configuring libgpg-error.
Configuring libgcrypt.
Configuring zlib.
Configuring libxml2.
Configuring librpc.
Configuring libattr.
Configuring libdb47.
Configuring libopenssl.
Configuring netatalk.

opkg install netatalk
Package netatalk (3.1.10-1) installed in root is up to date.</code></pre></div><p>However, the next step is editing afpd.conf but there is no netatalk folder in /etc at all. I have:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/# find . -name netatalk
./lib/upgrade/keep.d/netatalk
./overlay/upper/lib/upgrade/keep.d/netatalk
./tmp/netatalk</code></pre></div><p>I rebooted my router but same thing.</p><p>I am on an Archer C7 with Designated Driver 50104 / LuCI Master (git-17.050.51199-0f5321d).</p><p>Any ideas? Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>I still can&#039;t seem to get the netatalk files onto my router, even though it says it is installed, so I manually created the config files, and I can see my network volume in my Mac as Time Capsule under my Shared resources, as well as through the Time Machine system pref panel disk selection.</p><p>However, when I click Use Disk, it tries to connect for a while, then gives me an error that it can&#039;t connect. It then asks me for the user/pass to the Time Machine volume, and brings me back to the disk selection screen.</p><p>Has anyone gotten Time Machine to work with OpenWRT? There&#039;s gotta be someone out there...</p>									</div>
