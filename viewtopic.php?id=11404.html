					<p>Hi, I&#039;m running the latest whiterussian release on a Linksys WRT54GS with X-WRT. I have miniupnp installed.</p><p>I&#039;m having issues with xbox live. Whenever the xbox360 tries to connect to live, it freezes the internet connection (or any network activity, for that matter) while it tries to connect. It usually does not connect on the first attempt. It says connection failed, I go and test the connection, and everything tests okay, and go to retry to connect to live. Usually it works on the second try after testing the connection, but not all the time. After the xbox has connected to live, it releases it&#039;s hold on my network activity, and everything works again, but during the connection attempts/connection tests on the xbox, nothing else is able to do anything. It&#039;s not a huge deal, but it&#039;s kind of a pain in the ass when playing a game or doing something online, when my roommate tries to connect to live.</p><p>Anyways, to recap, the xbox has some connectivity issues. It doesn&#039;t always connect to live on the first try, and while it tries to connect, it freezes up all network traffic.</p><p>Does anyone have any idea as to what the problem could be? I tried installing a different upnp daemon, but the other one that was there (cant recall the name of the package atm) wouldn&#039;t work at all.</p>									</div>
