					<p>Switching to LEDE is not really an OS change, since it is a fork from it. All the basics are the same (installation routine, configuration, luci ...). The difference between LEDE and OpenWRT is similiar as the different versions of OpenWRT. You could just regard LEDE as the latest stable release of OpenWRT.</p>									</div>
