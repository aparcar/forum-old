					<p>I have finally been successful in setting up my routers as to my needs. I have one gateway router WR512-3GN feeding from a local LAN with ADSL and a connected 3G stick as an fail-over when power/ADSL fails. Inside my own UPS powered subnet I have the 703N with extroot and 32GB of flash storage that is running Samba, Transmission and OpenVPN. When power and/or ADSL fails I have at least 6 hours of uptime/connectivity which is sufficient for the local conditions (suburb Jakarta, Indonesia). Thanks everyone for helping out! (non mentioned, non forgotten)</p><p>I still have a couple of things I feel needs to be done, perhaps someone can throw some light on them:</p><p>1. I sometimes go away on small business trips and leave Transmissin running, which means a ADSL/power outage will render transmission feeding from my 3G backup. Is there a way to use a script that checks what WAN2 is up and then pause Transmission until WAN1 is up again?</p><p>2. Transmission quickly eats up my 64MB RAM in the 703N as expected and swap is working as it should. However, I&#039;m pondering to switch to JFFS2 instead of Squash as I believe Squash loads more of the filesystem in RAM. Is the JFFS2 less consuming on the precious RAM compared to Squash, and how much will I save if going JFFS2?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
