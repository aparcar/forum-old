					<p>Hi!</p><p>I have a WNR3500L and the PCB and serial header looks just like the pictures on the wiki page:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wnr3500l#serial">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wnr3500l#serial</a></p><p>I was able to get the console output from the device using a cable such as this:<br /><a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/954">http://www.adafruit.com/products/954</a></p><p>However, it appears that I&#039;m unable to transmit any key strokes (I want to enable fail safe).</p><p>What could I be doing wrong? Is it the wrong sort of cable? Which cable should I use instead in that case?</p><br /><p>Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pixnion</strong> on 3 Mar 2013, 20:33)</p>

					<p>check your RX connector (green i think) and make sure its not grounded out or damaged... <br />make sure you don&#039;t have rx and ground reversed.</p><p>I have noticed the RX is quite picky from what I have noticed also... i generally have issues sending commands and generally involved restarting my computer or resetting the USB... .though i also run a cheap DLR-3 serial connector so i blame it on this.</p><p>This is also your first test with your cable so its possible something may be bad. cDc&#039;s Ada Fruit general has pretty good hardware so I really hope its not a bad cable <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>
