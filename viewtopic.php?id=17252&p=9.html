					<p>As i said before i have plenty of space.<br/>Mode 1: everything is bridge. one tagged vlan and one untagged have 320KB free space<br/>Mode 2: bridge/iptables/dhcp .... router mode with WAN i have 120KB free space</p><p>I do not need space ! I need speed <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile"/></p><p>Mode 2 is useless because we can make 1-2MB maximum with lan cable. Normally we should make 8-9MB.<br/>The problem comes from iptables and software routing. I did all tests with torrents. On single connection you can make 2.5MB. Torrents are the best test. You have hundreds of connections or more. </p><p>According to marvell specs:</p><p>&quot;2.2 Routing with the Marvell® Header<br/>The detailed information regarding this feature requires an NDA with Marvell Semiconductor.

At least 4-5 times more slower. No sense to use router mode with openwrt for now.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sanitariu</strong> on 6 Oct 2011, 11:47)</p>

					<p>free ram is between 500-1000KB. Have ram. Have space too. As I said with TP-Link340 you will never do speed with iptables except if you use some special features in marvell 80e6060 chip.

					<p>I will do when ready.<br/>Still swconfig is not working !!!!<br/>I dunno the reason but manually setting the phy registers of marvell chip in the code is working.<br/>Now trying some patches from dd-wrt.<br/>If someone has more information about swconfig please share.<br/>Dark... i will put config and images online for free when it is ready. Now we need only swconfig working.<br/>If you plan to use 340GD for something except bridge mode all better take another router.

					<p>It is useless in router mode, because you are limited to speeds like 2MB !<br/>The only practical way is using it like a bridge. The image in the wiki is enough for that.<br/>We also miss switch interface and looking at the code I did not see any swconfig or /proc/switch stuff.<br/>I abandoned router mode and now using only bridge mode. I just added vlan support. That&#039;s all.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello for all. Great&#039;n hot discussion.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>winword wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>v4.0 is AR8236+AR2317<br/>v5.0 is 88E6060+AR2317<br/>switcher may fails for wrong version</p></blockquote></div><p>Men, you are wrong.</p><p>TL-WR340GD v2.x is AR2317+88E6060 (In 2010 i did a kernel and rootfs patch to support VLANs but enabling VLANs and SWCONFIG will significantly increase CPU load and gives significant loss of speed even on simple LAN ports bridging so I don&#039;t include mvsvitch driver in working image.)</p><p>TL-WR340GD v3.0 is ar2317+ar8236 (I disasmed tplink vxWorks core to find constants to enable CPU port in the switch and wrote simple driver for kernel. Eth is working but no VLANs. BUT!!! There still no support for ethernet in uRedBoot. There is updated uRedBoot in newer images with XYmodem support. You must solder serial console to flash it.)</p><p>TL-WR340GD v4.0 is AR9331 SoC with 2Mb/16Mb Flash/RAM. Board looks the same as board for TL-WR741 v4.x (can look here <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr741nd)">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr741nd)</a> Untill now nothing is done to port Linux on it.</p><p>TL-WR340GD v5.0 has not seen in wild so no info about it. </p><p>Guys, do you have some space to upload?<br/>@sanitariu&nbsp; i didn&#039;t receive any messages from you.</p>									</div>
