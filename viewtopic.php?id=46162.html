					<p>Hello,</p><p>I want to set up my TL-WR740 as an dumb AP and use also ethernet ports in switch. So I use this: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap.">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap.</a> Because I don&#039;t know how this router is build I used&nbsp; configuration for &quot;For devices with switch and dedicated WAN, e.g. WNDR3700&quot; and after that wireless works like a charm but ethernet ports doesn&#039;t want to work (they doesn&#039;t receive an IP address). So I used other options but without success. How to configure it to works with wireless and ethernet on the same time?</p><p>best regards,</p>									</div>
