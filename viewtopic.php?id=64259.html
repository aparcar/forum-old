					<p>Hello.<br />I finished setting OpenVpn server on openwrt router.<br />Now I can access my private vpn server inside the campus network.<br />(Regardless the building, APs. can connect wherever inside campus)</p><p>However, I can&#039;t access VPN outside campus. The router has IP from University<br />(10.122.x.x)<br />The public IP is different.<br />(161.64.x.x)</p><p>I guess this is reason why I can&#039;t connect to my VPN outside campus.<br />I used server address as 161.64.x.x port 1194 but it doesn&#039;t work~</p><p>I also used DDNS service, but this only updates public IP address.<br />How can I solve this problem? I want to use VPN service outside the campus.</p><p>very thanks for your help!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hangon1234</strong> on 22 Apr 2016, 05:55)</p>

					<p>You would need to redirect one port on the external router from your campus to the 1194 port on your router; you have to contact the network administrator and get them to do that, but they will probably refuse.</p>									</div>

					<p>Perhaps give some thought as to why the University currently restricts external access over the existing service that they provide. And to how you can convince them that your proposed private VPN service is a better option.</p>									</div>
