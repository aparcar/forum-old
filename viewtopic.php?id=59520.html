					<p>Having been searched a good router to install openwrt for weeks.<br />This <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/belkin/f9k1115v2">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/belkin/f9k1115v2</a> looks ideal to me. <br />And it&#039;s on sale at Amazon: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Dual-Band-Gigabit-Router-F9K1115/dp/B004U6NS5Y">http://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Dual-Band- â€¦ B004U6NS5Y</a><br />Anyone used this router before? Just a little worried of any pitfalls to install and use openwrt on it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>w0z7yu</strong> on 11 Sep 2015, 04:26)</p>

					<p>Similar hardware to the Archer C5/C7 which are probably the best supported AC device under OpenWrt. This should work similarly, but with fewer urers to help you out if you need help. No guarantee you&#039;ll get v2 from Amazon either. </p><p>Note: the USB 3.0 ports are probably not supported.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have one and have successfully installed OpenWrt 15.05.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t done much testing yet.&nbsp; I can confirm however that the USB 3.0 ports don&#039;t work properly with USB 3 devices, but USB 2.0 devices seem to work just fine in either port.&nbsp; However both ports don&#039;t seem to work simultaneously!</p>									</div>
