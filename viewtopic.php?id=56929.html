					<p>The igb module in openwrt looks Ok.</p><p>Maybe it is some module load order bug ?</p><p>Please file a report that &quot;kmod-igb&quot; does not detect your device. (attach dmesg/bootlog and show lsmod output that kmod-igb is loaded)<br />Acording to the commit (<a href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=f96a8a0b78548c0ec06b0b4b438db6ee895d67e9">kernel commit</a>) it should work with that igb module.</p>									</div>
