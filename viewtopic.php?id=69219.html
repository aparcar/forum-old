					<p>Hello all,</p><p>I am looking to implement adblocking on my router. I apologize in advice for being a newb in the openwrt scene, but i am technical person and just wanted some advice/opinions. </p><p>Which would make more sense for adblocking on a home network? OpenDNS or the methods described on the github tutorial &quot;OpenWRT adblock implementation&quot;? </p><p>I have setup a wireless guest network by following the steps by the tutorial &quot;Configure a guest WLAN using the Luci web-interfac&quot; on the openwrt wiki.</p><p>The twist... If possible, i would preferto filter the LAN and GUEST interfaces with different filtering.</p><br /><p><strong>Info:</strong><br />Router: Linksys WRT1900ACS<br />Firmware: OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 / LuCI 15.05-142-gb6330a1 Release (git-15.363.78009-956be55)<br />Kernel Version: 3.18.23</p><br /><p>Thank you in advance for your assistance!</p><p>-thehofl</p>									</div>

( and i assume most people using OpenWRT do care about &#039;being in control&#039; themselves&#039;).</p><p>Alex.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for the info Alex.</p><p>That is a good point. I was just thinking about a semi-automated way to keep malicious/unwanted dns lists updated... Similar to using DNSBL with pfsense.</p>									</div>
