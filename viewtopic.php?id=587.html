If I remember filepath correctly, you can find it from /proc/net/arp. I am currently having wide open wlan, no passwords, no crypting, anyone&#039;s welcome, as my dvd/music/video player does have wlan but doesn&#039;t support any protections very well. And anyway.. It&#039;s a nice feature to see if another computer is on..</p><p>Also, could be nice if there would be also list of their MAC addresses, and atleast 3com&#039;s &amp; zyxel&#039;s (ZynOS btw. sucks a big time) routers are able to show machine&#039;s host names ( not from /etc/hosts, windows machines seem to tell their name when they try to get ip from dhcp )..
