					<p>The WRT55AG v1 is an old wireless router that I was not currently using.</p><p>I downloaded using the device Admin page openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs-trx to the unit.&nbsp; Now the unit is unresponsive to pings (192.168.1.1) and an Etherreal trace show no output on port 1.&nbsp; I have connected my pc to port 1 (not internet/wan port) and given it a static ip of 192.168.1.10/24.&nbsp; When power cycled the wrt55ag comes up within a second with the LEDs on port 1 lit green/green/amber (speed) and then nothing.</p><p>Suggestions?</p>									</div>
