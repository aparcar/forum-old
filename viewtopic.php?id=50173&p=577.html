					<p>@sera, no joy with the latest DTS patch.</p><p>@ygor.almeida, The build to which you refer is the build that I flash, I simply <em>drag&amp;drop</em> to google drive for others to use if so desired. As I have no use for ppp in my environs it will not find its way into the prebuilt image. Other packages are built and available, but you have to install those. If other prebuilt images have what you need OOTB I would suggest one of those; a build is a build... See:</p><p>* use <a href="https://downloads.lede-project.org/releases/">stable</a><br />* or <a href="https://forum.lede-project.org/t/builds-for-wrt1200ac-wrt1900acv1-wrt1900acv2-wrt1900acs-wrt3200acm/545">cybrnook</a><br />* or <a href="https://forum.lede-project.org/t/autobuilt-images-for-wrt1200ac-wrt1900acv1-wrt1900acv2-wrt1900acs-wrt3200acm/3330">autobuilt</a><br />* or <a href="https://forum.lede-project.org/t/pre-compiled-updated-mwlwifi-drivers-for-stable-releases/3262">current mwlwifi</a> on stable<br />* or the one that you referenced</p><p>I don&#039;t use any of those and cannot speak to what is contained.</p><p>But first and foremost, I would recommend to anyone that they build their own image suited to their requirements. At any rate, this is not the thread to discuss the image I post, and would ask if you have any further queries to post <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=68229">here</a>, thanks.</p>									</div>
