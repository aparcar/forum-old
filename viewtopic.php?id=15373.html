					<p>Hello, </p><p>I&#039;ve been trying to configure wrt54g v2.2 and wrt54gl v1.1 to run wds, and have the &quot;master&quot; node to be client for another wireless network (using sta), and ofcourse, i need them to be accessable by wireless client, so i tried setting up ap on it too.</p><p>Although i found some hints that say i cant be in client mode and in AP mode (maybe i misunderstood what was said, it was not straight forward) anyway i managed to get that combination to work (sta + ap ) on the wrt54gl. (im not saying it doesnt work on the wrt54g, it just didnt work for me since i have played a lot around with it till im unable to access one), but anyway i know it works (and it does <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> )</p><p>now the wds + ap is also working, i can ping back and forth and with little or no loss.</p><p>Now getting the three to work togather , ill be having ap+wds+sta on the first node, and ap+wds on the second yields a strange behavior, i can get everything to ping everything, but with lots of loss and complete loss after a while, when associated with the second AP , my dhcp requests dont go through to the first node. but ping works :S </p><p>My question is, is there a limitation that makes it impossible to have the 3 (sta, ap and wds) work togather properly?</p>									</div>
