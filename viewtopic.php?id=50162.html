					<p>Hi friends,</p><p>I&#039;m using multiwan with two internet connections and it&#039;s working really fine.</p><p>The only problem I&#039;m facing is that with some specific services (like some internet banking websites) the &quot;hopping&quot; between the two connections causes a &quot;timeout error&quot;.</p><p>So, I just want to know how could I setup my multiwan router to use the same wan for some specific domains after the first connection with that domain.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
