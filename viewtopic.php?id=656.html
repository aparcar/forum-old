					<p>Below is an edited discussion from the #kismet irc today - times are GMT +12.&nbsp; What dragorn is saying is that he didn&#039;t originally see channel hopping as important for the drone as it was more likely to be used as an IDS on a single channel; that channel hopping may break AP mode on a WRT54 and the ioctls don&#039;t support channel hopping; channel hopping may be included in a future release if he has time to analyse the ioctls.</p><p>[09:26] &lt;gr8w11ne&gt; Anyone know if channel hopping functionality has been/ is being developed for kismet_drone?<br />[09:26] &lt;dragorn&gt; It&#039;s always been part of it.<br />[09:31] &lt;gr8w11ne&gt; dragorn: Oh, that is not what you wrote in a February post?<br />[09:31] &lt;gr8w11ne&gt; Drones are mostly meant to be completely standalone and uncontrolled, typically for monitoring a known network install locked on a single channel.<br />[09:34] &lt;gr8w11ne&gt; Specifically on the WRT54GS it does not appear to channel hop unless you put it in client mode<br />[09:36] &lt;dragorn&gt; The wrt54 source doesn&#039;t hop, period<br />[09:36] &lt;dragorn&gt; has nothing to do w/ the drone<br />[09:36] &lt;dragorn&gt; Typically drones don&#039;t hop, no, though they could if you told them to.&nbsp; If the source supports it.<br />[09:37] &lt;gr8w11ne&gt; So using openWRT can you tell a drone to hop?<br />[09:37] &lt;dragorn&gt; no<br />[09:38] &lt;dragorn&gt; Like I said - the wrt54 source doesn&#039;t support hopping.<br />[09:38] &lt;dragorn&gt; At some point in the future, maybe, with reservations.&nbsp; I&#039;m extremely hesitant to change the configs of the AP in such a way that it&#039;s not longer useful as an AP<br />[09:38] &lt;dragorn&gt; it also depends if I get the ioctls deciphered or not.<br />[09:39] &lt;gr8w11ne&gt; So the problem is in the Broadcom binaries which are not open source?<br />[09:40] &lt;dragorn&gt; Not exactly.<br />[09:40] &lt;dragorn&gt; THe problem is that I haven&#039;t had time to decipher the ioctls from the wl control program<br />[09:40] &lt;dragorn&gt; Nor am I convinced it&#039;s a good idea in the first place.<br />[09:41] &lt;W8TVI&gt; why would it be a bad idea?<br />[09:41] &lt;dragorn&gt; because it will break the AP<br />[09:41] &lt;dragorn&gt; as far as being an AP is concerned.<br />[09:41] &lt;W8TVI&gt; ok, why would it break it?<br />[09:42] &lt;dragorn&gt; because if you&#039;re hoppign channels<br />[09:42] &lt;AndyCap&gt; dragorn: but it would be a cheap(ish) way to get more than one sniffer on a laptop, (and also let win32 users sniff)<br />[09:42] &lt;dragorn&gt; you&#039;re not being an AP on the channel you were configured to be<br />[09:43] &lt;W8TVI&gt; dragorn: the thing is, if you want it to hop channels, your not using it as an ap anyway<br />[09:44] &lt;devine&gt; dragorn: the broadcom linux drivers aren&#039;t compatible with wireless-tools ?<br />[09:45] &lt;dragorn&gt; the wrt54 doesn&#039;t use iwconfig.<br />[09:45] &lt;devine&gt; then it sucks even more.<br />[09:45] &lt;dragorn&gt; I wouldn&#039;t go as far as all that<br />[09:46] &lt;W8TVI&gt; devine: not really.<br />[09:46] &lt;dragorn&gt; AndyCap: Yes, my concern is people who don&#039;t know what they&#039;re doing nuking their ap.&nbsp; And that I don&#039;t have the ioctls figured out, so it&#039;s moot until then anyhow.<br />[09:46] &lt;AndyCap&gt; dragorn: hehe, I couldn&#039;t think of a more deserving bunch. :-P<br />[09:46] &lt;W8TVI&gt; devine: tell me where else you can ge a $60 linux based router/ap that has a managed 5 port switch in it?<br />[09:47] &lt;AndyCap&gt; still, it&#039;s not like they nuked it beyond a reboot.<br />[09:47] &lt;dragorn&gt; AndyCap: Remember the amount of stupid I get every day in my inbox.<br />[09:47] &lt;AndyCap&gt; dragorn: ah, good point.<br />[09:47] &lt;dragorn&gt; Basically when I added the wrt54 source I never considered someone would lug one around with them as a sniffing card<br />[09:47] &lt;devine&gt; W8TVI: heh. indeed<br />[09:47] &lt;dragorn&gt; Working off that assumption, you don&#039;t want to break the AP, youw ant to run an IDS alongside running an AP, which is what it does<br />[09:48] &lt;W8TVI&gt; dragorn: I like the idea that it can be used as more than just an ap<br />[09:49] &lt;AndyCap&gt; dragorn: says the man with a pc installed in his car. ;-)<br />[09:49] &lt;dragorn&gt; well, when I finally get the newcode code done someone can ahssle me about adding channel changing to that.<br />[09:49] &lt;W8TVI&gt; dragorn: with the Sveasoft firmware you can use it bridge too<br />[09:49] &lt;dragorn&gt; Or someone else can decipher the ioctls and send me a patch if you don&#039;t want to wait.<br />[09:49] &lt;AndyCap&gt; dragorn: or even diy. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />[09:50] &lt;dragorn&gt; W8TVI: I&#039;m aware.&nbsp; Bridging doesn&#039;t mean you want it changing channels either, though.<br />[09:51] &lt;AndyCap&gt; hehe, if only clients were fast enough to follow the hopping AP around.<br />[09:55] &lt;gr8w11ne&gt; Thanks, I will post some of this discussion in the OpenWRT forum where there have been some questions on this<br />[09:56] &lt;dragorn&gt; If someone wants to send me a diff to call the ioctls to change the channels, I&#039;ll merge it<br />[09:56] &lt;dragorn&gt; Eventually, I&#039;ll add it, but don&#039;t hold your breath because I have a lot to finish before then</p><p>gr8w11ne</p>									</div>
