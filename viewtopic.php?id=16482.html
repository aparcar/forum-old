					<p>Greetings,</p><p>I&#039;ve looked around for quite awhile but I just wanted to be sure that there&#039;s nothing I can do before I potentially brick this router trying to reset it.</p><p>I have a 4 MB WRT54g.&nbsp; &nbsp; Well, it&#039;s actually a Motorola 850g but it shows up as &quot;Linksys WRT54G/GS/GL.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; I used to run DD-WRT o it and switched to OpenWRT several months ago.</p><p>Anyways, I have several OpenVPN tunnels running on the device.&nbsp; &nbsp;I needed to add a new one.&nbsp; &nbsp;I couldn&#039;t create the configuration files because it said the device was full.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Filesystem                Size      Used Available Use% Mounted on

					<p>OpenVPN is a hefty packages, it and the dependencies take up a lot of space. The log files should not be stored in flash, but in the ramdisk (/tmp and /var) or not enabled.</p><p>Run `du -sh /jffs/*&#039; then run that command on the largest folder within /jffs/, and keep doing that until you know which files/packages are taking up the space.&nbsp; You can&#039;t use ipkg to remove packages (it can&#039;t record which packages were removed) until you free up space, so you&#039;ll have to delete files first.&nbsp; You can save space by building packages into the image when you create it. SquashFS is a more efficient filesystem than JFFS2, but of course is read only.</p>									</div>

					<p>check disk space BEFORE installing :-) or mod it with a mmc card.<br />btw: you can see as long as i&#039;m registered here i never heard someone else complaining like this about the behaviour of jffs it&#039;s well known that jffs reacts like this when its too full.<br />the advantage is that the wrt is still functional. (with my sat receiver which also uses jffs for firmware i had it many times)<br />But another hint =&gt; if it this behaviuor bugs you =&gt; go back to linksys firmware and be happy that you get rid of this problem.</p><p>ciao gerd</p>									</div>

					<p>OKOK lets say &quot;stock firmware&quot; :-)<br />But if you use a CF card for additional packages why you do not set it up as ext2 ?

					<p>Hi,</p><p>you can use the command &quot;mtd erase mtd4&quot; to entirely erase the jffs part of your flash memory.</p><p>After rebooting the device you should get an empty jffs filesystem.<br />The read-only part of your firmware images will be left intact.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don´t believe it!!! Openwrt is widely used with small devices with a very low amount of memory. Going into this is very common, SOMETHING SHOULD BE MADE TOFIX THIS!! Its completely crazy blaming the users for this. It happened to me again, once in a year it happens, and there is nothing I can do, over six routers I had configured for friends and family. In a wrt54g installing openvpn and almost anything else fills the entire filesystem and there is no other solution than reflashing.</p><p>Right now I filled a router 200 miles away. So I have no choice of reflashing, not from here. Reflashing over the Internet, yeah! sure! NO WAY! And everyone points to the user: you should check always first! C&#039;MON!!! ITS A BUG!!! It&#039;s RIDICULOUS to have this kind of behavior on an OS used so WIDELY ON SMALL DEVICES!!!! PLEASE!!!</p><p>I&#039;m going to bed now, but GOD HOW I HATE THIS MOMENTS!! HOW I HATE THIS!!!!! Everything else is so great on openwrt, but this. Every time I install something I have to make calculations and start to wonder if I&#039;m doing things right. F*CK I MISSED A COUPLE OF BYTES!!

Reconfiguring network interfaces, changing firewall rules, restarting the device, installing new packages - any operations of such kind should only be done when you&#039;ve got immediate physical access to the box in case something went wrong. Ignoring this rule will put you at risk of sitting 200 miles away from device moaning loudly &quot;Ups, I bricked it again!&quot;.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>tristangrimaux wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>And everyone points to the user: you should check always first! C&#039;MON!!! ITS A BUG!!! It&#039;s RIDICULOUS to have this kind of behavior on an OS used so WIDELY ON SMALL DEVICES!!!! PLEASE!!!</p></blockquote></div><p>OpenWRT is not an &quot;end-user&quot; friendly OS. It require a lot of knowledge and *nix system administration skills in order to be used properly. Feel free to use more user-friendly firmwares like DD-WRT or even original vendor-supplied firmwares and you will be free from obeying the rule &quot;triple check anything you type as root&quot;. Don&#039;t blame OS for it&#039;s extreme flexibility, blame yourself for not being able to use the system wisely.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>tristangrimaux wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Every time I install something I have to make calculations and start to wonder if I&#039;m doing things right.</p></blockquote></div><p>By the way, opkg should refuse to install any package if it would not fit within free space on the root filesystem. At least it used to do so on the firmwares I recently compiled for the D-Link DIR-320 using the latest sources from SVN trunk. If it didn&#039;t warn you and then stalled/failed during the untaring of the package due to the lack of free space feel free to fire the bugreport to the openwrt bugtracker.</p><p>Another thing to note is that I&#039;ve been able to recover from the fully filled jffs2 filesystem on one of the OpenWRT boxes by the simple deletion of files using &quot;rm&quot;, but the minimal required amount of &quot;free&quot; space for filesystem to become writeable again was about 256Kb. Of course, YMMW.</p><p>Last but not least. If you feel yourself adventurous and lucky and you have got enough knowledge not to make any errors you may always proceed with backing up most essential configuration files, pivot_rooting back to the read only squashfs, creating tmpfs, populating it with minimal subset of files from &quot;stucked&quot; jffs2 partition, pivoting_root to mini_fo with the prepared tmpfs overlaid over the read only squashfs, using mtd to erase the contents of the jffs2 mtd partition (usually called rootfs_data), formating it back to jffs2, re-mounting and re-populating with the essential configuration files you had backed up earlier and finishing by pivot_rooting back to the mini_fo with newly formated jffs2 partition overlaid over the read only squashfs. It is very hard to do it successfully on a production system especially when you&#039;re far away from the box and use VPN link over internet to get into shell. But it is possible for sure: I had just given this procedure a try on one of the DIR-320 boxes I use for experiments with the openwrt.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lexa2</strong> on 19 May 2010, 05:57)</p>
