					<p>Hi,<br />I recently installed Kamikaze on a Foxboard using the Etrax 100LX target. <br />So far so good but now I&#039;m trying to have it recognize and use a ZyXEL NWD271N Wifi USB adapter with an Atheros ar9170 chipset I believe.</p><p>When I look at /etc/config/wireless it stays desperately empty and wifi detect doesn&#039;t return anything either.<br />The device is detected properly (which I think rules out the possibility of the problem coming from the USB controller) but I think I might be lacking the drivers for the ar9170 adapter. The trouble is that I can&#039;t figure out how to get them or maybe I already have then but can&#039;t figure out how to include them via make menuconfig. Or maybe they simply just aren&#039;t available for the foxboard yet.</p><p>If anyone has a guess as to how I might solve this problem, you&#039;re very welcome.</p><p>Please also bear in mind that I&#039;m new to OpenWrt and actually not much of a Linux user as well so it could also be that I overlooked something very basic and all I need to do is use some command I don&#039;t know about yet.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, I figured out that what I probably need are the ath9k drivers that are part of the mac80211 package. <br />Problem is that this package doesn&#039;t show under &quot;Kernel modules/Wireless drivers&quot; in make menuconfig.<br />I guess that means mac80211 probably isn&#039;t available for the foxboard yet.

					<p>Thank you but I don&#039;t have these in my list for the Foxboard(etrax) target (although they appear for other targets).<br />I just had a look at mac80211 makefile and noticed that the drivers I needed are explicitly unavailable for etrax.

					<p>I found a quick and dirty way to compile the packages I needed by going into their Makefile files and removing the dependencies that where preventing me from installing them.<br />This allowed me to install kmod-ar9710, kmod-ath, kmod-cfg80211, kmod-mac80211, crda, hostapd and iw from &quot;make menuconfig&quot;<br />Now the adapter is at least correctly recognized (though I&#039;m not sure at all if it works properly since I don&#039;t think what I did is very healthy) :<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> root@OpenWrt:/# dmesg
