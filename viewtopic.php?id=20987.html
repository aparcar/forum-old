					<p>Hello, everyone.</p><p>I&#039;ve downloaded kamikaze_8.09.1_source.tar.bz2, and <br />copied ixp4xx.config to .config in top directory.</p><p>But compiling failed while autoconf 2.62 was compiled with the following message:</p><p>There seems to be no Makefile in this directory.<br />You must run ./configure before running `make&#039;.<br />make[4]: *** [abort-due-to-no-makefile] Error 1</p><p>So, I cd&#039;ed to build_dir/host/autoconf-2.62 and run ./configure after installing m4 package on host development<br />pc(ubuntu 9.10).</p><p>Makefile is generated but build system tries to install autoconf related things to below /usr/local/, causing<br />error due to permission denied.</p><p>Does anybody know a workaround to this?<br />Is there any --prefix like argument which I should specify when I run &#039;./configure&#039;?</p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>Seems to be worked around.</p><p>Autoconf seems to be built for building cross tool chian..<br />I manually ran configure and gave it --prefix command like this:</p><p>$ cd build_dir/host/autoconf-2.62<br />$ ./configure --prefix=${TOPDIR}/staging_dir/host/</p><p>where TOPDIR is the top directory where kamikaze source file was extracted.</p><p>autoconf successfully was built and compilation went on.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dobest03</strong> on 9 Jul 2009, 13:26)</p>
