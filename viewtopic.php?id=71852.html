					<p>the 1 free year of meraki cloud support is expiring on my Meraki MR18, so I&#039;m starting to try to install OpenWRT on it. I&#039;ve looked up all the guides and read everything I found first, and everything seems within my ability, but I&#039;m finding the one issue I&#039;m struggling with right now is exactly what I was most afraid of... I have absolutely no idea how to use uart.</p><p>So I bought my USB to serial adapter. I&#039;m at least 95% certain I have my adapter plugged into the correct pins (I have an imgur link, but I a not allowed to post it). The USB port shows in the Win10 device manager as COM1, bits per second set to 115200. I installed putty, and have the serial line set to COM1 and the speed set to the same value. All the values match, but nothing happens when I click Open in putty (even after I power on the MR18).</p><p>Right now, I&#039;m just trying to connect with uart to make sure I can. I haven&#039;t actually started the root process.</p>									</div>

The nomenclature can be a bit misleading, since the word &quot;serial&quot; is often mentally associated with the concept of COM-ports found on x86-compliant motherboards. Unlike the UART port that is found in microcontrollers, a COM port commonly uses the RS-232 protocol, which is incompatible with the TTL (or CMOS) UART port on the microcontroller.</p><p>What you need is a USB-to-TTL-UART (or CMOS-UART) adapter. Your run-the-mill &quot;USB to serial&quot; adapter will fry the microcontroller, if you try to send data through it.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>nuentes wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I&#039;m at least 95% certain I have my adapter plugged into the correct pins (I have an imgur link, but I a not allowed to post it).</p></blockquote></div><p>You can post the link, but use spaces between the dots of the address (i.e. &quot;www. imgur. com / myPicture.jpg&quot;). This limitation will go away once you have posted a few times. It is in place to inhibit spammers from registering accounts and posting links to whatever sites they want to advertise.</p><p>Check your adapter type (post its make and model if you are unsure), post the imgur link and let&#039;s have a look at what might be going wrong.</p>									</div>

					<p>Make sure you have flow control set to &quot;none&quot;.&nbsp; </p><p>To test adapter, do not connect to the router, connect a jumper from TX to RX on the adapter.&nbsp; When you open the terminal and type in some text, you should see what you type.&nbsp; When you break the connection, you should no longer see what you type.&nbsp; This shows the adapter and PC software are working.</p><p>Next connect ground TX and RX to the router (never connect the red +5 wire, leave it open) and boot it up, you should see boot log text.&nbsp; If nothing happens in the terminal, unplug the power to the router and switch the RX and TX pins and try again.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 24 Aug 2017, 18:12)</p>

					<p>@tunk - when I swap the TX and RX, the MR18 won&#039;t power on at all.<br />@mk24 - I&#039;m not even getting the terminal</p><p>I mean, maybe I misunderstand how putty works, but I figured when I click &quot;Open&quot;, it would make the connection and open a prompt. However, nothing happens at all. If I got a prompt, I probably wouldn&#039;t even have posted anything. Since I get nothing, I&#039;m assuming I&#039;m doing something wrong.</p><p>Here are the device settings and putty settings:<br />i.imgur . com/asRdB4F.jpg</p>									</div>

					<p>On PuTTY, you always need to create a profile for your connection. When you want to open the connection, you click on a saved profile&#039;s name, then click &quot;Load&quot; and finally click &quot;Open&quot;.</p>									</div>
