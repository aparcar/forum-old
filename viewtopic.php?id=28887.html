					<p>I have openwrt running on my G3010, it was supported by the ifxmips target which is now merged into lantiq. At the time I flashed the device (2 years ago), there was no usb, vlan, dsl-support making the device a dumb switch with openwrt on it. </p><p>It would be cool to start with vlan-support for the switch, so the device can function as a router. There&#039;s currently a discussion going on the mailinglist: <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.embedded.openwrt.devel/9246">http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emb … devel/9246</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, firstly I&#039;d like to say hello to everybody. This seemly is a very nice project to make really some really useful stuff from some old routers =D.</p><p>I have a G3210, too and like to build a webradio from it. I saw there are some other projects on the web too that use openwrt for building a webradio. As I already read, there is no USB and no WIFI support atm for this device because lack of PCI support. There&#039;s written &#039;work in progress&#039;. Can anybody make some estimation on how long it will last to get some news on that ?</p><p>I&#039;ve some avarage linux knowlegde, too. On this project I&#039;d like to learn more about the abilities and configuration of linux environments. On the other side I&#039;d like to build some cool stuff of new hardware for myself ^^.</p><p>I hope some of you can help me on some parts of modding the G3210.</p><p>I know I will need some additional parts like sound parts, some kind of lcd/buttons etc. but I have the knowledge to search for this parts and wire it to the board. For sure, USB support would be very useful here. </p><p>If everything wents well I am surely going to develop all infos on it so that others can use that infos for their own.</p><br /><p>greets =D</p><p>edit:<br />If anybody wants to know:</p><p>CPU &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ram &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Flash&nbsp; Network WLAN VoIP S0 &nbsp; &nbsp; USB Serial JTag<br />Infineon Amazon (235MHz)&nbsp; &nbsp; 64MB &nbsp; &nbsp; 16MB &nbsp; &nbsp; 4x1 &nbsp; &nbsp; b/g &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ajenkuhn</strong> on 8 May 2011, 15:18)</p>
