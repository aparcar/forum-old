					<p>Dear,<br />As an IT manager in a belgian school, I currently have different Linksys Wap300N ap&#039;s.<br />I&#039;d like to know if there is any way to make them &#039;smart&#039; and central manageable.<br />Because today everyone knows the WEP key and I don&#039;t like to repeat my self by logging in into each AP and change the password.</p><p>A system where I can allow a device by Mac address would be nice, but it should be perfect when the pupils need a temporary key for a temporary access.</p><p>The teachers should have a key that not expiers.</p><p>Is this possible with OpenWRT?</p><p>Kr,<br />Oele</p>									</div>
