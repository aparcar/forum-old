					<p>Hi,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I started to play with the WRTnode boards. This board is based on MT7620N chip. I can say that it is a very interesting board, you have access to all the pins you ever dreamed of, the footprint of the board is half of a credit card.<br />&nbsp; It is nice also that on WRTnode board you can test your firmware using USB flash boot, simply put on a fat32 USB flash drive the firmware you want to try (put the .bin on the root of the USB flash and rename it &#039;uimage&#039;) and WRTnode will boot that firmware os you won;t risk to brick you board.<br />&nbsp; Right now I work to setup the I2C on the WRTnode, there is a wiki explaining step by step the process (<a href="http://wiki.wrtnode.com/index.php?title=WRTnode_add_i2c_support">http://wiki.wrtnode.com/index.php?title â€¦ 2c_support</a>), but something is not working on my setup. So I looked into OpenWRT documentation, I found and tried a few things related to OpenWRT and I2C:</p><p>*things I found (hope that it is correct, I don&#039;t intend to mislead people, please correct me if I&#039;m wrong)<br />-various modules are loaded at the boot time (you can check them in folder&nbsp; /lib/modules/3.10.44), use command lsmod | grep i2c to check what i2c part was loaded</p><p>-i2c is present as a device if is listed in /dev (should be i2c-0)</p><p>-modules are loaded following a specific order, this is visible in /etc/modules.d (use ls after getting in that directory)</p><p>*things I tried<br />-add i2c support as described in WRTnode wiki</p><p>-insert i2c-tools package at the kernel compilation time:<br />./scripts/feeds install i2c-tools</p><p>-then run:<br />make menuconfig</p><p>-go to Utilities --&gt; &lt;*&gt; i2ctools, add i2c-tools, save and exit</p><p>-make </p><p>-you should get a .bin file with i2c support. Just a mention: the blue LED on the WRTnode is not lit using this .bin file, check you SSID presence</p><p>(-get a USB memory stick, format it to fat32, copy the .bin on it and rename it to &#039;uimage&#039;, connect the USB stick to the WRTnode using the USB special cable delivered with the card, WRTnode card will boot the image &#039;uimage&#039; from the USB memory stick and you don&#039;t have to flash the image directly on your WRTnode and maybe brick it) </p><p>-after boot, connect via webbrowser (web GUI LuCI interface) and check in System -&gt; Software what i2c packages are loaded on the WRTnode</p><p>-for me are available i2c-tools, kmod-i2c-algo-bit, kmod-i2c-core, kmod-i2c-gpio, kmod-i2c-gpio-custom, kmod-i2c-ralink, libi2c</p><p>-connect to WRTnode via SSH</p><p>-insert module i2c-dev - but here is no happy end: <br />insmod i2c-dev.ko<br />Failed to find i2c-dev. Maybe it is a built in module ?</p><p>-i2c found in /dev:<br />root@OpenWrt:/etc/modules.d# cd /dev<br />root@OpenWrt:/dev# ls<br />bus&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;log&nbsp;

					<p>Yes, I followed every step. Initially I modified WRTnode.dts file, a second try was to use directly the file offered from the wiki (I was afraid about some indentation, some hidden details).<br />I am pretty sure that it is something strange like last time (n.b. 10 minutes boot time, solved after I used / manufactured a new set of cables), but my problem is that I don&#039;t know where to look for. <br />I decided to give the WRTnode to another friend, he will cross compile and check what is going on, maybe he will be lucky than I am. <br />It is frustrating to have such problems and other people around you to say &#039;Hmmm, strange, I did exactly the same and works just great!&#039; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />But this is the beauty of embedded world, you learn every day things and end up but making something interesting.<br />Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Softwarewise you seem to be on the right way, since i2cdetect runs smoothly. The problem about having virtually the bus full of devices may be on the hardware side. Check cables, soldering, resistors, pins. If you know how to do it, you could even hook up a LED to the pins and check if it flashes, while running i2cdetect.</p>									</div>
