					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;d like to ask for support of OpenWRT for extended range (XR) for Atheros ath5k cards. Is there any OpenWRT version that supports this feature? <br />AFAIK Atheros ath5k card supports XR mode, but it is hard to find any detailed information regarding it on the internet. <br />I know that not every HAL supports XR - AFAIK only closed source (binary) HAL supports it. I know that there are 5 XR registers in atheros, but how to use them to enable XR bitrates?</p>									</div>
