					<p>WiTi Boardi is a very nice open hardware platform. The board uses MT7621A high performance router SoC, <br />supports open source&nbsp; OpenWRT OS. The board&#039;s dimension is relatively small 16cm x 10cm, about three<br />credit card in a row. </p><p>Of course, this board can be used as a good performance router. With the two SATA3 ports on board, we<br />can easily create Soft-Raid1 by mdadm tools. After installing Samba service and NFS service, the board <br />turns into a reliable storage server. We can also install CMS or git code repositories on the board. Wow!<br />This board can provide all functions I need, and the consumption of electricity is very low. </p><p>What’s more, WiTi has 30 expansion ports(including USB, JTAG, UART, I2S, GPIO..). We can connect to <br />Arduino by USB extension, so that WiTi can connect to thousands of sensors; we can make WiTi as a nice<br /> wireless HiFi with the I2S extension; we can also use the GPIO extension to control electric light, Motor, and so on.</p><p>More infomation url: <br /><a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/witi-board-open-home-intelligence#/story">https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/witi … nce#/story</a></p><p>- MT7621A Dual-Core 880Mhz (4 threads)<br />- 256MB Memory (up to 512MB)<br />- 2.4G WiFi (supports IEEE 802.11b/g/n, up to 300Mbps)<br />- 5G WiFi (supports IEEE 802.11a/n/ac, up to 867Mbps)<br />- WAN port x2, LAN port x4(both are 1000Mbps)<br />- SATA 3.0&nbsp; x2(supports 3.5 inch HDD)<br />- USB3.0 x1<br />- microSD x1<br />- RTC battery for storage application<br />- 30 Expansion Ports(Including USB, I2S, JTAG, UART, GPIO)<br />- 16MB SPI NOR Flash(Optional for bigger size Nand Flash)<br />- 4-pins serial debug port<br />- RF Antenna Connector x4<br />- WPS/GPIO Key&nbsp; x1，Reset Key&nbsp; x1<br />- Power LED x1, SATA LED x 1, WiFi LED x 2, LAN LED x4</p><br /><p>E-Mail: support@mqmaker.com<br />Community: <a href="http://forum.mqmaker.com">http://forum.mqmaker.com</a><br />Twitter: @mqmaker<br />Facebook: @mqmaker<br />G+: @mqmaker</p>									</div>
