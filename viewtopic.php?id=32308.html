					<p>hello everyone<br />i&#039;m confused about vlans; i have read quite a few &#039;personal experiences&#039; and semi-complete tutorials, but they haven&#039;t cleared up my confusion. Most of all, information about openwrt is mixed up. F.e. how I supposed to configure vlans? through Luci? through nvram variables? through uci or directly in the /etc/config/network files ?????</p><p>On wag54gl there are 6 ports. By default 4x lan ports (lan-vlan0 iface), 1x wan port (wan-vlan1 iface), 1x cpu-side port (the eth0 port).<br />The kernel talks to the 5 ports (lan+wan) through its eth0 port.</p><p>Additionally the wireless is on eth1 with is bridged with the lan iface into br0</p><br /><p>As i read the default /etc/config/network file I can understand it, more or less, it sets up the vlans and then connects them (eth0_x) to interfaces (lan, wan). I also read about the lo iface. But there is no info about the bridge interface, nor which ifaces are attached to it...! how can i change smth if it isn&#039;t there?</p><p>I read in an openwrt tutorial page about the uci configuration methodology, but it only repeats whatever I can read in the /etc/config/*&nbsp; files....</p><p>On the contrary, i read about ppl choosing to setup their systems through the nvram system (what is that, there is no openwrt explanation page setup for this).</p><p>I chose to do it the gui way to avoid the confusion. so I created a vlan to which I attached a couple of ports (but there is no field to add a name to that virtual iface!) and created an interface too which I called locolan. I saved and applied my changed. <br />Checking back the /etc/config/network file, my changes had been somewhat registered.. There was no name given to the newly created vlan2 (just the vlan ID 2) , and there was NO entry about the interface locolan that I had just created !!! that is weird and definitely NOT the expected behaviour..</p><p>Since i can&#039;t seem to follow the way openwrt works, I ask you to give me a kick start. How does the system work? how Am I supposed to tweak it?</p><p>Considering my setup I need to do the following.<br />I have a linux pc used as a router, it runs many many network daemons. I would like to keep it and not load the linksys with extra struff.<br />So I basically want to place that pc between the internet side and the lan side of the linksys. <br />An incoming packet would therefore come in from the wan to the linksys, get ffwed from port 0 go to the router pc,be processed, leave that pc, come back to port 1 of linksys and be send to the intranet through one of the ports 2,3,4,wlan ...<br />In a sense I want to separate the usage of linksys-modem from the linksys-switch and place that pc in the middle.</p><p>There are 2 possibilities: <br />1) I don&#039;t use the vlan support on the pc . Instead I use its 2 nic&#039;s -one inet side and the other intranet side.</p><p>-I should let vlan1(wan) as is.<br />-I should release port 0(say) from vlan0<br />-I should create a vlan2 (call it rtr-lan) and attach port 0 and 5 to it. set both ports to &#039;untagged&#039;<br />-I should (should I?) attach this vlan2 to an iface say eth0.2 (i&#039;m a little confused abt this still) <br />-I should disable inet access from ports 2,3,4,wlan since these will become a simple switch. (should I do that in firewall level?)</p><p>2) I utilize only 1 nic in the pc and use trunking </p><p>-I should let vlan1(wan) as is.<br />-I should release port 0(say) from vlan0<br />-I should create a vlan2 (call it rtr-lan) and attach port 0 and 5 to it. SET port 0 to &#039;tagged&#039; , let port 5 as untagged (is it correct that trunking is enabled by default on port 5, or should I tag 5 too????)<br />-I should (should I?) attach this vlan2 to an iface say eth0.2 (i&#039;m a little confused abt this still) <br />-I should disable inet access from ports 2,3,4,wlan since these will become a simple switch. (should I do that in firewall level?)</p><p>Am I missing any step? and how should I go about doing all these steps?</p><p>Thank you very much for your help and information<br />nass</p>									</div>

					<p>Quite an impressive first post. I would suggest to research the topic a little bit, then posting 1-2 questions. It will increase your chances of getting a precise and helpful answer.

					<p>Hi, </p><p>openwrt uses the files in /etc/config/ as configurationfiles, you can change everthing there directly. <br />uci is a (scriptable) way to read/edit the files in /etc/config/. you are able to set every option through uci. <br />the webinterface (luci) has forms where you can add/display a specific/limited set of options of the configfiles (using uci). But the discribed behaviour seems strange.&nbsp; </p><p>But if you want full control, edit the config files directly (or use uci) but not the webinterface. check <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/start#uci.configuration">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/start#uci.configuration</a></p><p>So to your setup... what do you want to achieve is really complex, do you really need this? What are this &quot;network daemons&quot; that need all traffic passing through?</p><p>So this are my sugesstions, which would be easy to set up and are commonly used: </p><p>1. Run the firewall on the pc, use the openwrt as dumb Switch/Accesspoint (no need VLAN stuff)<br />2. Run the firewall on the openwrt-box and create a dmz (e.g. vlan2) for the pc, and do the rest with firewallrules (on the openwrtbox), no need for 2 Vlans on the pc. </p><p>What would be the advantage of having a firewall an openwrt and apparently another one on the pc, which forwards the traffic between two interfaces (or vlans)? I really don&#039;t get it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 10 Oct 2011, 11:09)</p>

					<p>Hello to both,<br />I hadn&#039;t received any answer in my email for a while and forgot about this post. </p><p>Please bear with me,<br />the reason i&#039;m doing that is, experimentation.. There is 2-3 ways I could go about doing it, but this is the way that&#039;ll teach me something. and openwrt is there to be tweaked. I was certain that by placing some things in order in my head I could go about it.</p><p>I&#039;m still not sure about many things , but I have managed what I wanted to achieve. I thank you both for the help you provided (i had visited most of the links you suggested F1aw, but they added to my confusion instead of relieving it) <br />for example , F1aw, you give me a link about nvram, which says in the beginning &quot;The most of the configuration in OpenWrt is done by setting variables in the NVRAM&quot;. Then you, eleon126 come suggesting to config everything through uci!what should I do? </p><p>Also it looked like altering values with uci didn&#039;t survive a restart! I must be missing something here, yet there is no tutorial to explain things clearly..</p><p>I&#039;ll post my config files when i&#039;ll have access to my wag54 again, but in the meantime, could you please explain how to use uci and nvram ? what are the differences? what should i choose to use?</p><p>thank you</p>									</div>
