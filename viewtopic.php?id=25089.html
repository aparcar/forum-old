					<p>Hello</p><p>Currenly I use madplay to play tracks on my V2 running backfire. However this wont play aac files. </p><p>I know mpd offers aac support, however its a server. </p><p>Is there a client which will run on the router itself to play the files that mpd serves.

					<p>Hello,</p><p>I know this is and old thread but I was looking for AAC related stuff in the forum and maybe I can try to explain a few things if you haven&#039;t found an answer yet.<br />Mpd does not serve files on a network. Mpd is a music player daemon that is build around a Client/Server architecture, being mpd the server itself. So to use mpd you will need two things, to run mpd and to use a client to send commands like play, stop or add to the running server. I think the best client for a router is mpc which is a command line interface only. <br />If you decide to use mpd you will have to configure /etc/mpd.conf to have a workable server. <br />The other thing you will have to do is compile libfaad2 again because the package in the repositories is compiled for using floating point. So one must use the -DFIXED_POINT option. I have just created a patch for this (well I rather used an old Makefile made by Cortland Setlow and copied the fixed point option to the Makefile&nbsp; of the current version).</p><p>Cheers, <br />Guillermo.</p>									</div>
