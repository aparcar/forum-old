					<p>Hi Everyone,</p><p>I&#039;m new here. First I should say that I am a .Net developer, and don&#039;t have a significant amount of linux experience.&nbsp; I have purchased this device here: <a href="http://www.omnima.co.uk/store/catalog/MiniEMBWiFi-p-16180.html">http://www.omnima.co.uk/store/catalog/M … 16180.html</a></p><p>It comes pre-loaded with OpenWrt.&nbsp; &nbsp;Looks like it is a build from around November 2011, so reasonably recent.</p><p>I simply want to toggle a relay using the usb.&nbsp; I could do this by using a usb relay board, but I really don&#039;t want to due to the amount of physical space that will take up (and the cost en mass).&nbsp; &nbsp;My plan is to toggle the power of the USB on and off and connect a relay to that.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am certain that the power of the usb can be controlled somehow on this device (it&#039;s not hard wired to the power supply) because it doesn&#039;t become powered until after OpenWrt boots. </p><p>I&#039;ve read around and apprently under standard linux you can do it with something like<br />echo &quot;0&quot; &gt; /device/usb1/power/level</p><p>but unfortunately OpenWrt doesn&#039;t have the /power/level under any of the device &quot;folders&quot;.</p><p>There must be a way - can I force it to unload and reload the usb drivers?&nbsp; Need some advice from a linux guru here.&nbsp; </p><p>Thanks <br />Henry.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you very much for your response.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to toggle the USB Power rather than have to use an external module.&nbsp; I think I&#039;ve got the approach nailed.&nbsp; I need to compile the following code for OpenWRT: <a href="http://www.gniibe.org/oitoite/ac-power-control-by-USB-hub/hub-ctrl.c">http://www.gniibe.org/oitoite/ac-power- … hub-ctrl.c</a></p><p>I&#039;m following the instructions here <a href="http://manoftoday.wordpress.com/2007/10/11/writing-and-compiling-a-simple-program-for-openwrt/">http://manoftoday.wordpress.com/2007/10 … r-openwrt/</a> but I don&#039;t know which version of the SDK to get, I&#039;ve got the &quot;Attitude Adjustment&quot; version of OpenWRT on my device.</p><p>Are you able to advise?</p><p>Cheers,<br />Henry.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>You can get the very latest trunk version of OpenWrt:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>svn co svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk/</code></pre></div><p>or the last revision that has been successfully tested with MiniEMBWiFi:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>svn co svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk/ -r 29557</code></pre></div><p>To build OpenWrt with LuCi follow the instructions from the <a href="http://www.omnima.co.uk/docs/OmnimaMiniEMBWiFi-overview.pdf">manual</a></p><p>Once this is built you can add your program/packages as per the instructions by manoftoday.</p><p>R.</p>									</div>
