					<p>The default web interface of OpenWrt, LuCI, is a Lua application, not PHP. Are you going to run a PHP application of your own on it? If so, look at the package size of the PHP4/PHP5 packages you need in the <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/packages/">packages directory</a>. </p><p>You can use <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/meta/tags">tags</a> in the wiki to find routers that support the features you need, such as amount of flash memory, RAM, single- or dual-band and so on.</p>									</div>

					<p>The PHP/LUA remark was warranted because PHP takes up quite a bit of resources. You would probably be looking at a router with lots of flash space, memory, and a decent CPU. Also, if you want to replace the standard web interface with one driven by PHP, you&#039;ve got quite a task on your hand.</p><p>As for your original question, &quot;popularity&quot; really isn&#039;t a very good qualifier. There are no (published) numbers on the &quot;popularity&quot; of routers. If you take a look at the forums, some <em>brands</em> seem to come up more often than others. But of course, that highly depends on one&#039;s perception, and the forums are certainly not a very reliable indicator.</p><p>I would recommend you make your decision based on what machines are readily available to you, within your price bracket, that fit the baseline hardware requirements -- and then check for the availability of OpenWrt on these machines. Once a router is fully supported by OpenWrt, that support usually doesn&#039;t go away, regardless whether the machine is particularly &quot;popular&quot; or not.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 26 May 2014, 04:54)</p>

					<p>According to Google, Linksys WRT54GL is the most discussed router in this forum (3310 hits) among various models I tried. The TP-Link WR1043ND, which seems to be regularly discussed from what I see, isn&#039;t even close at 2210 hits. The WRT54GL has 4 MB of flash and 16 MB RAM, you won&#039;t be able to fit PHP and a web server on it. Does this help you?</p><p>Edit: OpenWrt installations don&#039;t &quot;report back&quot; anywhere, so I can&#039;t think of any more reliable statistics. Statistics from downloads.openwrt.org will be misleading, as they don&#039;t cover images built from source. People who do large deployments probably won&#039;t download image files per router either.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makro</strong> on 26 May 2014, 12:19)</p>
