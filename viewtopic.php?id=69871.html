					<p>I&#039;m not so sure about this but i think here&#039;s the first problem: one router is already connected to main router over lan and his IP adress is 192.168.1.1. Openwrt device&#039;s IP is also 192.168.1.1. Do i have to change this? </p><p>I can&#039;t understand Network -&gt; Interface<br />Under Network -&gt; Wifi i have two networks disabled or not associated. Why?<br />Where should i start? Make wifi network on which will clients connect or connect to the main router first then make network? Also, what does bridging mean?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lujurisic.pt</strong> on 17 Feb 2017, 12:16)</p>

What is this? i cant find useful information on internet. Please help someone. <br />Already tried to revert to stock firmware but it says it&#039;s unsupported format so i got stuck with this without wifi on my floor.
