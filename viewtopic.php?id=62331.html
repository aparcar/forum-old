					<p>Hi All,</p><p>I am new to OpenWRT having recently purchased a HooToo HT-TM02. I intend to use this primarily in hotels for my own wifi hotspot with which I can use devices such as my Google Chromecast.</p><p>I have successfully configured it with the internal wireless and wired interfaces set up as WAN connections for the hotel wifi/network. I already had a 2.4GHz USB device which I have connected and configured to provide a second wifi radio acting as an AP for my devices.</p><p>That all works great, however I want to replace the USB wifi interface with a dual band device that will allow most of my devices to use the 5GHz band to minimise risk of interference with the hotel&#039;s wifi network.</p><p>I would prefer a device which I can get up and running simply by installing a pre-built package. Doesn&#039;t necessary need to have the best range as clients will normally be in the same room, however I am aware that some USB devices can overheat when used as an AP so would want to avoid picking something where that is likely to be an issue. A low profile device which I can leave plugged in without significantly increasing the size of the router would be better (bearing in mind this is for travel purposes), but I can live with something longer if necessary.</p><p>Does anyone have any recommendations?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>
