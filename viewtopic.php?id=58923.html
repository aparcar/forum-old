					<p>I am new to OpenWrt. I ultimately want to set up a captive protal.<br />So i tried openwrt-brcm2708-bcm2708-rpi-b-plus-ext4-sdcard.bin<br />to test on my raspberry B+</p><p>According to some howto&#039;s like this here<br /><a href="http://computers.tutsplus.com/articles/installing-openwrt-on-a-raspberry-pi-as-a-new-home-firewall--mac-55984">http://computers.tutsplus.com/articles/ â€¦ -mac-55984</a><br />i should be able to connect to openwrt&#039;s web interface after finding it&#039;s IP, which should be set via DHCP when connected to a network.<br />But when i boot the raspberry, i see in ifconfig, that a network called br-lan is the only one with an IP. This seems self assigned.<br />I can telnet to it from a pc with a direct connection, but that&#039;s it...<br />I missunderstand something here i guess.</p><p>Do i need to configure something to get OpenWrt to use DHCP?</p>									</div>
