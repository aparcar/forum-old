					<p>Hi guys</p><p>OK I made a boo boo!</p><p>Didn&#039;t check the firmware I was currently on : ArcherC20iv1_0.9.1_3.2_up_boot(151014)_2015-10-14_15.23.13.bin<br />(This is the latest UK firmware. I Forgot I updated it when i bought the darn thing!)</p><p>I tried to flash using the latest OpenWrt for my router : openwrt-15.05-ramips-mt7620-ArcherC20i-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin</p><p>And now all my router does is flash it&#039;s LED&#039;s at me</p><p>The Power LED is constantly on.<br />LED 4 Turns on followed a second by LED 2,3,5,6<br />Then 2,3,4,5,6 turn off<br />Then the pattern repeats.</p><p>Does that mean I&#039;m opening the thing up and dusting off my R-Pi to re-flash it?</p><p>Tried to to do the Tftp recovery but not sure i got it working properly. I&#039;ll give the recovery Tftp another go later tonight.</p>									</div>

					<p>I had the exact same problem yesterday, and posted about it in the C20i thread <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=330580#p330580">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php â€¦ 80#p330580</a></p><p>I tried to do the TFTP recovery and it&#039;s just made it worse. Now only the power LED lights up and everything seems bricked. LAN ports don&#039;t work, etc.</p><p>I was wondering whether the serial port method would be able to de-brick it (though I&#039;ve never done that method before so I have no idea what to solder, etc etc). Or maybe the bootloader is corrupted and it&#039;s bricked beyond repair, I don&#039;t know.</p><p>It seems others in that thread had the exact same problems, too. I hope they respond if they&#039;ve managed to fix it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Did the same thing. TP-Link C20i is bricked. The HW switch (LAN ports) does not seem to be initialized and does act as a simple 10/100 switch. But can&#039;t tftp a new image, I think uboot must have been overwritten. Mine is sitting in my recycle pile.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yup same position now.</p><p>Just the power LED. Thankfully I&#039;ve my old &quot;BT HH3&quot; to fall back on.</p><p>Looks like I&#039;ll have to pick up the equipment to flash the chip manually. (and learn how to do it!)</p><p>But that&#039;s project for another time.</p>									</div>
