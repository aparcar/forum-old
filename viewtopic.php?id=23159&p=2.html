You could also try wireless to wireless. In a perfect world you should be getting more than 100 Mbps since it doesn&#039;t pass trough the switch.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zorxd</strong> on 20 Jan 2010, 23:46)</p>

					<p>My biggest concern is stability. Has anyone actually used ath9k in a real world Access point setup to serve large amounts of people? I have a test bed setup and so far it appears that after a random amount of time I cannot associate anything with the wireless signal. I saw someone else had a similar problem in the forum and the question when unanswered. Anyone have any thoughts on what might trigger such a case where the router appears to be operating fine and pushing out an SSID and signal, yet a computer just cannot assoicate with the access point running in 2.4ghz N? A simple reboot clears the problem up, but then it just seems to randomly appear again.</p><p>@essdz Thanks for pointing out the txpower. I was looking for the same thing</p><p>I wish there was a complete section just for talk on openwrt ath9k/mac80211. I think a lot more would get accomplished and information would be far easier to find. You could probably say that about every subject, but N is coming along so good. It would be nice to have easy access in the forum with some many people providing feedback and top notch information.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>foxtroop11</strong> on 21 Jan 2010, 18:16)</p>

					<p>just a note for those of you who think that the speed drops to 2MB/s.. It doesn&#039;t necessarily. It could also be a Network Manager bug if you&#039;re running Ubuntu.

					<p>the backfire-svn-tag is not the same as the &quot;stable&quot; (binary) backfire-release. You get all kinds of updates which will be in the next interim-release 10.3.1<br />If you want to stick to the binary release, you should check out the same revision (check the ssh-loginscreen for the revision number), but i would recommend installing your compiled images, because there are many ath9k-related fixes since 10.3</p>									</div>

					<p>Mhh - checking out the revision 20728 which should be the 10.03 release revision of backfire, doesn&#039;t fix my problem. If I recompile ATH with the &quot;Force Atheros driver to respect user&#039;s regdomain&quot; setting and use this modules (kmod-ath and kmod-ath9k updated) it panics on inserting ath9k. I know it would be better installing my own build completly, but for now i don&#039;t have time for getting the routers config back after this and would just get it going with installation of custom modules.
