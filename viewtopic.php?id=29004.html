					<p>Hello again.</p><p>I think I got extroot working now on my WRT54GL with a self-compiled image (target is brcm-2.4, THIS DESCRIPTION DOES PROBABLY NOT APPLY TO KERNEL 2.6!)</p><p>To quote myself for the description of my troubles:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>simsim wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I am struggling with this, too.</p><p>I modded my WRT54GL 1.1 with an SD-cardreader and I&#039;m using the 2.4 series SDHC module from SVN trunk. I added a custom initscript in preinit, the card is detected, partitions are reported just before the overlay mount is set up i.e. in time but still the settings in fstab seem to be plainly ignored. No matter what I try.</p><p>The card and the wiring is ok, I can mount the card&#039;s partitions manually, but OpenWRT does not take the hint to use it as extroot. All necessary packages (extroot, blockmount, hotplug, etc.) are built into the squashfs-image.<br />I think there is a bug somewhere in extroot...</p><p>On a side note: There are two partitions on my SDcard, I intend to use the first as rootfs, the second one is mounted as /home. The homedir gets mounted on boot, so interpretation of fstab seems to be working - in principle, aside from the root fs.</p><p>@jow: I checked with &quot;mount&quot; and &quot;df&quot; and it&#039;s simply not showing my 1.2 GB ext2 partition *anywhere* in the output of these two commands if and only if &quot;is_rootfs&quot; is true for said partition&#039;s entry in fstab. Other partitions on the same card or said partition with &quot;is_rootfs&quot; disabled are mounted without problems by /etc/init.d/fstab , as stated above.</p></blockquote></div><p>I think it was a glitch in /lib/functions/extmount.sh. There is a tiny snippet of sed magic that feeds the name of a module object file to insmod. In this snippet, the module&#039;s filename extension is hardcoded to *.ko. However, on Linux kernels prior to 2.6 (i.e. 2.4 on brcm-2.4), this extension used to be *.o.</p><p>I changed that script and for now, it appears to work. The sdcard is mounted on overlay, read and write operations work. Shall I file a bug report against brcm-2.4 SVN/trunk?</p><p>Thanks for your support,</p><p>SimSim</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve been working on this with 2.6 for a while. I&#039;ve had no such luck and I&#039;m not about to switch to 2.4. I think a bug report for both kernels is in order.</p>									</div>

					<p>@nodoze: I just tried on a 2.6 kernel from the 10.03.1rc4 image/packages. First, I tried to just mount anything on my SDcard (which is detected by mmc_over_gpio) regularly without using extroot. The mount succeeds, but if I try to read from the ext2 partition on the sdcard, my WRT54GL just locks up and has to be power-cycled.</p><p>I think I&#039;ll be going back to the brcm-2.4 target. With the fix mentioned above, it seemed to work fine. Though I&#039;d like to use a 2.6 kernel... anyway.</p>									</div>

					<p>My router can read/write regularly mounted sd cards. Maybe its an RC4 problem as the trunk image works.</p><p>2.4 doesn&#039;t serve my wireless needs, 2.6 doesn&#039;t do storage right. What a crappy decision to have to make</p>									</div>
