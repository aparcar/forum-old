					<p>I have finally gotten fed up with the stock firmware (Linksys smart wifi) on my mums router(Linksys EA3500(Audi)), so I decided to put OpenWRT on it. I just looked on the hardware table, and there it was. On the device page it had the file I could download and simply use the stock firmware to install (at least I think, is this my problem?). So, I installed it, and it worked great. I got everything set up perfectly and restarted it to make sure all the settings would stay applied, and they did. At this point, I figure I&#039;m about done, so I take it over to the modem, plug her in and wait for the WLAN to pop up, and something strange happens. The SSID that comes up is not the one that I had set, but the original one from when it was new. I figure that&#039;s pretty strange, but I must have just forgotten to apply something. So I head over to 192.168.1.1, and much to my surprise, I&#039;m greeted by the smart wifi setup page! Extremely confused, I power cycle the router, but to no avail, I again see the smart wifi page. I even try the good old DD-WRT 30/30/30 reset (hey, it was worth a shot), no luck. So I figure it was just some fluke, and re install openwrt. I power cycle it a number of times, and the firmware stays in place, and all my settings stay the same. I plug it into the modem, power cycle and... I see the stupid linksys page again!!! What could be happening here? Is anyone else having this problem? Is it some weird trick on linksys&#039;s part? I am at a loss here... Didn&#039;t I write over the old firmware? HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE??? Please help.</p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ehrack</strong> on 24 Aug 2016, 05:28)</p>

					<p>Hi, I have the exact same issue....the only difference is that my router resets to factory firmware if i perform a hard reset.&nbsp; i can save and apply changes, even reboot or unplug the router but if i actually do a physical hard reset of the unit it resets back to factory firmware.</p><p>any help would be appreciated.</p><p>thanks,</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not sure why you&#039;re having that problem, i have an EA3500 and it&#039;s working fine, but the reason it can happen is because the EA3500 has two partitions, so for example, if you&#039;re installing from the Linksys GUI and it&#039;s on partition 1, you&#039;re actually installing to partition 2 and the Linksys GUI is still on partition 1.</p><p>You can try installing OpenWrt twice, using the factory.bin file if installing from the Linksys GUI and the sysupgrade.tar file for installation from OpenWrt, that will put OpenWrt on both partitions, i don&#039;t know if that will solve the problem, but if you don&#039;t need the Linksys GUI it might be worth a try. On OpenWrt you can see what partition you&#039;re on by running</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>fw_printenv boot_part</code></pre></div><p>If you&#039;re on Linksys, you can check the partition by accessing the sys info page, which i think is at 192.168.1.1/sysinfo.cgi, but i&#039;m not positive.</p>									</div>
