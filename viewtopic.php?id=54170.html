					<p>Hello all,</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So, I was wondering how to configure the BATMAN nodes such that they receive an IP from a gateway. Currently, I have a node acting as an internet Gateway (call it A) connected to the external network through the ethernet. I have bridged the wireless acting in AP mode with the mesh. The bat0 interface takes on IP address of br-lan. </p><p>A DHCP server configuration is set up for lan and I was wondering if other nodes in the mesh would be able to pull an IP from it. How do I configure the non-gateway nodes so that they will be able to become DHCP clients and use node A as a gateway and DNS automatically?</p><p>Thank you all.</p>									</div>

					<p>Your one and only DHCP server should be on the gateway node&#039;s lan network.&nbsp; DHCP requests from anywhere in the meshed network will travel through the mesh and be fulfilled by that server.&nbsp; A DHCP server running on the gateway node A will be aware of A&#039;s connection to the Internet, and is by default properly configured to tell the DHCP clients how to access the Internet through A.</p><p>On the non-gateway nodes, you could put &quot;option proto &#039;dhcp&#039;&quot; under lan in their /etc/config/network to make them DHCP clients.&nbsp; </p><p>Static IPs foir the B nodes are are preferable however, since that keeps each node at a known IP so you can readily ssh into it, and it will have an IP even if your A node is down or there is some other problem with the mesh.</p><p>(Technically a B node does not need an assigned IP at all in order to serve as a layer 2 bridge onto the mesh.&nbsp; But then you will have no way to log in and administer it other than the serial console.)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 23 Nov 2014, 18:19)</p>

					<p>If I assign static IP&#039;s to the B nodes, then would I have to manually configure all of them to point to A as a gateway and DNS server? The ideal situation for me would be for me to introduce a &quot;client&quot; node to the mesh and have the mesh figure out how it can get access to the internet, since I may have multiple nodes acting as an internet gateway.</p>									</div>

					<p>When you say &quot;multiple gateways&quot;, will they all be connected (by some method outband of the mesh, such as Ethernet cables) ultimately to the same wan and public IP on the Internet?&nbsp; Or will they each have their own different ISP modem and a different link to the Internet?</p><p>The second situation is very complex and developers have worked on it for years with considerable debate over which method may be best.</p><p>---<br />Looking at an entry-level approach to the second situation...</p><p>Remember that BATMAN-adv works at layer 2.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t care about IP addresses at all.&nbsp; Each of your independent gateways (A1, A2, etc.) will have a different LAN subnet so they don&#039;t conflict with each other.&nbsp; They all run a DHCP server and the BATMAN &quot;gateway&quot; flag is set on each one.</p><p>BATMAN running on a B node will look at what it knows about neighbors in the mesh, in particular those gateway flags, and (layer 2) route DHCP requests from a new user to the closest gateway.&nbsp; &nbsp;The gateway&#039;s DHCP server will then configure the user onto its layer 3 subnet and they will now always use that A node for their Internet access.</p><p>This is fine for wired clients, except if their A node goes down, they lose Internet access until they re-DHCP (usually manually) to find another A node.</p><p>If your mesh is also providing AP access, the situation is not good for a mobile user such as someone streaming a movie on their iPad as they walk through the mesh.&nbsp; As they move out of range of the B node that they originally connected to, their wifi STA will reconnect to a different B node and (usually) re-DHCP.&nbsp; This may or may not give them the same gateway they had before.&nbsp; If they now have a different public IP, the movie server will lose contact with them.</p><br /><p>It should again be noted that the B nodes&#039; link to the Internet is only for their internal use such as setting the time by NTP or downloading packages.&nbsp; This use is limited and they don&#039;t necessarily need to be optimally configured for fast access, they could do it to a very distant gateway as long as the mesh stays intact.&nbsp; So you can static-IP them to what should be the best gateway based on where you initially site them.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 23 Nov 2014, 19:11)</p>

					<p>OK, that is much simpler.</p><p>The one and only DHCP server runs on the LAN side of the router which is connected to the Internet.&nbsp; I am assuming this is a separate device since the hardware you are using for nodes has only one Ethernet port and thus isn&#039;t usable as a wan to lan Ethernet router.</p><p>The nodes are all configured the same-- like B nodes-- except that the ones that have an ethernet connection to the Internet have the BATMAN &quot;gateway&quot; flag set.&nbsp; The ones which are not gateways (no hardwire link to the Internet) must NOT have the BATMAN gateway flag set.</p><p>You don&#039;t have any A nodes any more since the routing is now being done externally.&nbsp; All nodes will be straightforward Ethernet to mesh bridges that do not do any layer 3 routing or DHCP serving.</p><p>You can static IP the nodes or let them DHCP from the main router.&nbsp; It really doesn&#039;t matter.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 23 Nov 2014, 19:23)</p>

					<p>Hm. So would the other nodes pass along the request? <br />I have an issue that right when I set the prototype to dhcp, the node seems to disappear from the network. Any idea why this might happen? The lan is bridged to bat0 and eth0.</p>									</div>

					<p>BATMAN automatically passes it along.&nbsp; That&#039;s the whole point of BATMAN, when you have nodes linked into a mesh it works like an&nbsp; Ethernet switch, but wireless.&nbsp; Both are layer 2 bridging devices.</p><p>Your node will become inaccessible by ssh, ping, etc. because it changes its IP address to one obtained by DHCP, which you don&#039;t know unless you check the DHCP server&#039;s status and find which address it issued to the node&#039;s MAC (which is why I recommend static IPs for the nodes, or at least reserved IP&#039;s by MAC at the DHCP server).&nbsp; </p><p>You should still see that the node is active in the mesh at layer 2 by running batctl on another node in range and it&#039;s MAC will be listed as a neighbor.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 25 Nov 2014, 22:12)</p>

					<p>I got it. Thanks! </p><p>The node B right now has a bridged wireless AP to bat0 and the bridge is in DHCP client mode. It receives an IP from the internet gateway just fine. When a new device is connected to the wireless AP, it&#039;s DHCP request I believe is forwarded to that internet gateway to pull in an IP. I am able to access the internet through connecting with the wireless AP interface. I have the ethernet interface acting as a static DHCP server so that I can connect my computer to it. </p><p>What is strange to me is that the internet gateway has a bridge from the wireless mesh to the wireless access point. This bridge is not bridged with the ethernet. If it is bridged to the ethernet, it floods the ethernet with BATMAN ogm&#039;s and the external network seems to be confused with the header and it never gets an IP assigned to eth0. When the bridge does not include eth0, the eth0 dhcp client works and pulls in an IP from the external network. This bridge then acts as a DHCP server for the mesh network. On a non-internet gateway node, node B, I am able to configure its bridge (wireless AP and bat0) to be a DHCP client and receive an IP address from the DHCP server which is great! The gateway and DNS is configured to point to the internet Gateway, node A, as well. I am able to access the outside network just great even though node A is not bridged to the ethernet. Node A&#039;s routing table however is set up correctly and I believe that it is due to the routing table that node A knows what to do with node B&#039;s network requests. I tested this by removing the gateway from the routing table and all network requests to the external network failed.</p><p>Now, on node B, the eth0 is not bridged with the wireless and the mesh (the wireless and the mesh are bridged together however). When I connect to node B through the ethernet, I am not able to access the external network, even though the routing table is set up correctly. Is there a reason why it behaves this way?</p>									</div>

					<p>The B nodes should be completely bridged all three interfaces (br-lan to include bat0, AP and eth0)-- and I can&#039;t emphasize this enough-- NO DHCP SERVER.&nbsp; When you plug in your PC by Ethernet it will get a DHCP all the way from the A node or the external router.&nbsp; </p><p>If you are configuring a node that is not yet active in the mesh,. you will need to set a static IP on your PC, assuming the node has a static IP (highly recommended).&nbsp; If the node needs to DHCP, you can accomplish that by temporarily connecting it by Ethernet to the external router as well as your PC.</p><p>When you use an external router, the gateway node should also be fully bridged like a B node, it&#039;s purpose is to pass everything in the mesh to the external router which will then take care of the DHCP and routing.&nbsp; So no DHCP server in the gateway (I&#039;ll call it a B+ node).&nbsp; The only difference between it and the worker B nodes which take clients by Ethernet is that the BATMAN-adv &quot;gateway&quot; flag is on.</p><p>Right now you are still running an A node and NAT&#039;ing twice, which does work to connect to the Internet but it is not ideal.&nbsp; This approach will NOT work when you expand the setup to having two gateways going back to the same ISP.</p><p>This way you do not need to worry about routing tables in the nodes at all because all your layer 3 stuff is being done in the external router.&nbsp; The nodes are pretty much &quot;set and forget&quot; (other than that you need to have the BATMAN gateway status configured.)&nbsp; It is just like building a network by plugging together Ethernet cables and unmanaged switches, except that the links are wireless.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 26 Nov 2014, 22:24)</p>

					<p>I would like to add some thoughts :</p><p>Without a proper design for the considered usecase it is easy to get confused in the L2 / L3 network setup.<br />Therefore there is no &quot;golden rule&quot; how to configure modes and their appropriate internet gateways.</p><p>If there is only 1 batman-internet-gateway (BatIGW) involved, the setup is quite straighforward and possible as described by mk24.</p><p>However, in case there has to be any kind of user/traffic control,&nbsp; quite some effort has to be made to get a practical working result. </p><p>Major points would be:<br />&nbsp; clients AAA <br />&nbsp; internet access of the nodes themselves&nbsp; (status messages)<br />&nbsp; traffic control by firewall / filter<br />......</p><p>For multipe BatIGW there are much more considerations to be taken into account - namely auto wan fallback / takeover a.s.o.<br />In respect of network design, please keep in mind, that the batman-adv-L2-mesh does NOT act like a simple ethernet hub.<br />Subtle , but importent differences lurking in the backgound causing all sorts of problems. A good knowledge of the batman-adv functionalities is a must.</p><p>A helpful approach would be to design the network separate in respect to L2 and L3.</p><p>If there is any interest i can post a configuration skeleton.</p><p>regards<br />3zl</p>									</div>
