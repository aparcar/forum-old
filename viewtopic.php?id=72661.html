					<p>I recently changed firmware to (CHAOS CALMER (15.05.1, r48532))&nbsp; on my wrt1900ac because i was hoping to find truly free DDNS.&nbsp; However i havnt been able to investigate much as i have been stuck getting the usb drive and samba shares working.</p><p>At first the drive was NTFS.&nbsp; However when trying to play video files across the lan using things like KODI and VLC it would play for some time then just crash.&nbsp; Meaning the player would stop after a timeout.&nbsp; Sometimes i could replay the file and other times i needed to restart the router. </p><p>So after reading a bit (specifically that &quot;ntfs is a memory intensive file system&quot;) I reformatted the drive to ext4.&nbsp; Now though my 10-block script is not working to auto mount on plugin (I used the second script in this help doc (not allowed links but its.... &lt;yoursite&gt;/doc/howto/writable_ntfs))</p><p>and when i mount it manually i get the message below, however it DOES mount and is usable after this<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>root@SkittlesHost:/dev# mount /dev/sda1 /export/sda1<br />NTFS signature is missing.<br />Failed to mount &#039;/dev/sda1&#039;: Invalid argument<br />The device &#039;/dev/sda1&#039; doesn&#039;t seem to have a valid NTFS.<br />Maybe the wrong device is used? Or the whole disk instead of a<br />partition (e.g. /dev/sda, not /dev/sda1)? Or the other way around?</p></blockquote></div><p>So even though its usable at this point performance sucks and fairly often the drive just crashes (disappears from the samba share or times out during some operation).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Any suggestions on what my next troubleshooting step should be?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>owengerig</strong> on 27 Nov 2017, 17:38)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m currently using a WRT3200ACM as a media server. I have a USB drive attached, formatted as EXT4, that I share using SAMBA. I can feed two RPi&#039;s plus a laptop over WiFi, all running KODI, and watch a different film on each one at the same time, without glitches. We have a different device, but I am pretty sure yours should be more than capable of feeding at least one KODI instance.</p><p>If you reformatted the drive to EXT4, there is no reason to see any error related to NTFS. I guess there is some stale configuration. Search for any mention of &quot;NTFS&quot; in &quot;/etc/fstab&quot; and &quot;/etc/config/fstab&quot;.</p><p>On the other hand, once the drive is mounted as EXT4, I see no reason why it should crash at all. I would first have a look to the logs: execute &quot;logread -f&quot; on a terminal, and watch the messages roll. And I would not discard a hardware issue: how is the drive being powered?</p>									</div>
