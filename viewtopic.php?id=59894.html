					<p>Dear Openwrt Users,</p><p>I wanted to edit the OpenWRT wiki, adding few more details about different features I have been working on. Currently I am focussing on a project which has openWRT has base system. WHile working on it, I faced many hindrances, which is usually the case with open Source projects.</p><p>So, I decided to contribute some material to some of the Pages, particularly Firewalls, LUCI, networking showing diagrams and topologies.</p><p>How can I proceed in editing the Wiki.</p><p>My only selfish interest in this is that I too may be helped by other openwrt users <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>
