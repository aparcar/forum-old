					<p>Hi,<br />I&#039;m having troubles to restore kamikaze image on my linksys wrt54gl.&nbsp; I&#039;ve followed procedure for backup/restore firmware, but it seems kamikaze has some new trick, which I should applied.&nbsp; What I&#039;m trying to do is to copy finished configuration from one router to the new one, which should be straight forward, and I&#039;ve done it in the past (partially) with whiterussian version</p><p>I&#039;ve done:<br />---------<br />cd /tmp<br />mount -o remount,ro /dev/mtdblock/4 /jffs<br />dd if=/dev/mtdblock/4 &gt; /tmp/wrt-linux.trx<br />mount -o remount,rw /dev/mtdblock/4 /jffs</p><p>=&gt; then copied image to laptop and try to flash router, but no luck, <br />=&gt; tried to copy image to new router to /tmp and did<br />mount -o remount,ro /dev/mtdblock/4 /jffs<br />mtd -r write /tmp/wrt-linux.trx linux</p><p>but get following reply:<br />===========<br />Bad trx header<br />If this is a firmware in bin format, like some of the<br />original firmware files are, you need to convert it to trx.<br />Image check failed.<br />==================<br />=&gt;image size is:<br />-rw-r--r--&nbsp; &nbsp; 1 root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2162688 Jan&nbsp; 1 07:34 wrt-linux.trx<br />=&gt; df on old router shows<br />Filesystem&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1k-blocks&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Used Available Use% Mounted on<br />none&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7156&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2504&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4652&nbsp; 35% /tmp<br />/dev/mtdblock/4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2112&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1936&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;176&nbsp; 92% /jffs<br />/jffs&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1152&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1152&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0 100% /</p><p>(it should have enough space if it fits on one router)<br />=&gt;probably need to convert image to trx format??? but how<br />=&gt;I didn&#039;t backup nvram, as Kamikazi uses uci, so I doubt it would make sense</p><br /><p>any help, would be greatly appreciated </p><p>Noerr</p>									</div>

					<p>In following this thread and the wiki article, <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/BackupAndRestore">http://wiki.openwrt.org/BackupAndRestore</a> I have run this on Kamikazi 7.09 running on a NSLU2:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cd /tmp

					<p>The wiki says that the jffs should be mounted read-only in order to prevent corruption in the output file.&nbsp; As I say, I don&#039;t know the relationship between the various mtdblock designations, and so can&#039;t do much except copy what I have read.&nbsp; Any explanation of how they relate or of why my dd command might not have worked will be appreciated.&nbsp; I have no external memory on this NSLU2, and am trying to produce an 8-megabyte image which I can flash into another NSLU2 in the standard manner.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, after advice from Rod Whitby on the NSLU2-linux forum, this works for me (I don&#039;t know if the mount r/o and remounts are needed--still awaiting feedback):</p><p>mount -o remount,ro /dev/mtdblock/4 /jffs<br />dd if=/dev/mtdblock0 &gt; /tmp/NSLU2C_image.bin<br />dd if=/dev/mtdblock1 &gt;&gt; /tmp/NSLU2C_image.bin<br />dd if=/dev/mtdblock2 &gt;&gt; /tmp/NSLU2C_image.bin<br />dd if=/dev/mtdblock3 &gt;&gt; /tmp/NSLU2C_image.bin<br />dd if=/dev/mtdblock4 &gt;&gt; /tmp/NSLU2C_image.bin<br />dd if=/dev/mtdblock6 &gt;&gt; /tmp/NSLU2C_image.bin<br />mount -o remount,rw /dev/mtdblock/4 /jffs</p><p>This produces a file in tmp, NSLU2C_image.bin, which is 8388608 bytes long, the size of the image which is flashed into the NSLU2.&nbsp; Note that the dds omit mtdblock5, which is a subset of mtdblock4.</p><p>Now how to get this file back on my Windows PC.&nbsp; There is probably a simpler way, but I don&#039;t know it.&nbsp; I made the file available over http by running this:</p><p>/usr/sbin/httpd -p 82 -h /tmp -c /etc/httpd.conf</p><p>which makes port 82 available with the home directory of /tmp.&nbsp; My httpd.conf does not specify a password.&nbsp; </p><p>Then from the PC I ran this PHP program (php must be available).<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>&lt;?php // GetNSimg.php gets NSLU2 openWrt firmware image file
  $Geturl = &quot;http://192.168.1.77:82/NSLU2C_image.bin&quot;;
  $A = file_get_contents($Geturl); 
  $fh = fopen(&quot;NSLU2C_image.bin&quot;, &#039;w&#039;) or die(&quot;Can&#039;t open file&quot;);
  fwrite($fh,$A);
  fclose($fh);
?&gt;</code></pre></div><p>I then successfully flashed this image (using the Sercomm upgrade utility) onto a new NSLU2 for which I had not been able to find the IP address.&nbsp; I was able to access this NSLU2, change the ip address, and voila, a cloned openWrt 7.09 slug.</p>									</div>
