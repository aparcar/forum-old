					<p>This may be an old thread, but I had to do some digging into this myself because we used nodogsplash for some of our clients and I didn&#039;t find it particularly clearly explained anywhere else.<br /><strong>Some background:</strong><br /><em>There is no way for a router to push open an application on a connected device.</em> This would be a major security hole, which has long-ago been blocked in operating systems as best they can if it existed.</p><p>Any utility like nodogsplash has to detect that a client is connected and intercept traffic in order to provide the Terms and Conditions page (T&amp;C). The logical (and almost only) choice is the browser without having to install client software. Because of the end-to-end encryption with HTTPS, it is difficult if not impossible to perform a redirect or provide different code back because the security is supposed to block man-in-the-middle attacks, so the common &quot;low-road&quot; is to only intercept HTTP requests and redirect those.</p><p><strong>Result:</strong><br />As a result, this is the common behaviour for any of these products. IF there is a T&amp;C page required, then the router intercepts the HTTP request, redirects it to the T&amp;C page local to the router and upon accepting the T&amp;C, the firewall rules are updated to allow this client access via the router, presumably to the Internet. Typically then the browser is redirected to an advertising page <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" />, but that&#039;s configurable.</p><p>The other result is that the users of the service often don&#039;t get onto the Internet because they haven&#039;t opened a browser, or the default page on the browser uses HTTPS and so they never do see the T&amp;C page, never mind accept them and in doing so, get authenticated. User education is key.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done up a nice flowchart that can be used when troubleshooting these connections (though none of the staff at our customer use it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/roll.png" width="15" height="15" alt="roll" />).</p><p>I hope that this helps clarify the issue!</p>									</div>
