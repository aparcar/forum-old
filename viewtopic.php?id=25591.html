					<p>hello all...<br /> wow you have a lot of info here on a broad assortment of routers. Nice. I wondering if anyone here could help me with a little info...i have 3 Netgear cg814&#039;s and i would like to reflash the firmware on them. These were ISP provided 3349 chipset modem/gateways. I am looking for the 8 pin jtag pinout specs for this product. I know that the wireless function will be disabled once i install new firmware but i am more interested in the modem side as it offers an upgrade in ram over a motorola sb5101 modem. I am aware of serial flashing for this particular setup but I am interested in using a parallel jtag. i am able to detect the chip and the flash...but am unable to write to it so far.<br />I have been looking high and low for specs on these but have come up short. They are considered End of Life and Netgear offers no specs on them...(maybe I&#039;m not looking in the right place).<br />I could really use a nudge in the right direction if anyone knows where I can acquire this info.Thank you for your time....</p>									</div>
