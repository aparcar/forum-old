					<p>The stock firmware that comes with my Ralink RT3352 module has better range than OpenWrt. What are some things (tried and proven and outside of antennas) that I can try to get the range of OpenWrt on par with the stock firmware? I appreciate your feedback greatly. Thanks.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/ # ubus -v call system board
