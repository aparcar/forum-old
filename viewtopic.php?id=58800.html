					<p>I&#039;m looking at purchasing the TP-LINK RE210 AC750 WiFi Range Extender and was wondering if there was a compatible OpenWRT build for it. I see that the RE200 which is the version without the external antennas has a build. I&#039;m not sure if there are any interior differences which would mean the RE200 build wouldn&#039;t work on it so I though it was best to check with the experts first.</p><p>Thank you</p>									</div>

It works, but not 5Ghz and not AC. If you manage to run OpenWrt the RE200/RE210, it seems likely 5GHz/AC will not work.</p><p>Update: I added the RE200 here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/possible?&amp;#tp-link">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/possible?&amp;#tp-link</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zo0ok</strong> on 2 Aug 2015, 18:18)</p>

					<p>Hello there,</p><p>I&#039;ve just bought one of these (RE200), great value and even better if I could OpenWRT up and running.<br />But I&#039;ve a relative newbie, and would appreciate any advice on how to go about it specifically (yes, I&#039;ve read the Wiki&#039;s and guides, not looking to be spoon fed). Just has anybody out there got anywhere close?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
