					<p>Hello all,</p><p>I was able to successfully flash and run the kamikaze installer from the images posted at wl700g.homelinux.net, specifically, the image is kam7.09v2.trx.</p><p>I was trying to configure my interfaces with mac addres cloning so i would recieve a dhcp assigned ip address from my cable ISP.</p><p>I lost the original mac address to the interface and didnt know where to find it, so i rebooted and tried to re-flash erroneously thinking that this would bring my files back up.</p><p>Unfortunately I had already transfered to the boot loader to the hard drive using the prescribed procedure here</p><p><a href="http://wl700g.homelinux.net/portal/content/view/31/30/">http://wl700g.homelinux.net/portal/content/view/31/30/</a></p><p>After rebooting and attempting to Re-Flash using the same image &quot;kam7.09v2.trx&quot; the router just sits there blinking the ready light. you can ping it , but you cannot telnet to it, additionally you can tftp another firmware image.</p><p>At this point the router was bricked so i decided to re-install the original asus firmware and disk partition by using the asusextract tool which split the .nas file into the appropriate disk and flash image and i was able to flash it and then use the asus firmware restore tool to upload the nas file.&nbsp; So i essentially am back to square one.</p><p>However, now when i run FDISK from the ASUS factory firmware, i can see that i still have the manually created part1 part2 part3 as well as disc and part63 under /dev/ide/host2/bus0/target0/lun0 </p><p>I just want to remove this stuff and start from scratch so i can have another chance at re-flashing the kamikaze firmware.&nbsp; I have tried using other firmware images to no avail, the router just sits there blinking.&nbsp; Apparently the kamikaze image is either trying to copy itself to a disk but it cant succeed because the old screwed up config is there.</p><p>How do i remove part1 part2 and part3 from the /dev/ide/host2/bus0/target0/lun0 and do i even need to? or is there a way to recover the kamikaze installation?</p><p>Thanks again</p><p>Ron</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks guys, </p><p>I found the problem : it is in the sequence of events that you need to do in order for the router to boot this flash image.</p><p>First, unplug the power, then press the ez setup button, and hold it down.</p><p>second, plug the power in, count 4 flashes, on the fifth flash you will notice it will stay on longer than the other times, then turn off, the object is to let go right when it hits this fifth time.</p><p>tftp your kamikaze 7.09 v2 image.</p><p>WAIT 30 SECONDS</p><p>Press and Hold the EZ SETUP Button, and tap the Reset button, this step happens fast so pay attention, the ready light will blink once, LET GO of the the EZ Setup button.</p><p>The kamikaze flash image will load.</p>									</div>

					<p>Kamikaze Flash image does not recognize HDD.</p><p>on the instructions for booting Kamikaze, it says to fdisk /dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/disc</p><p>Unfortunately, this worked for me the first time i ran it, but suffice it to say that i dont have anything beyond /dev/ide/ nor in /dev/scsi</p><p>I will try rebooting to see if that brings up a disk from the kernel.</p><p>anyone have any ideas?</p>									</div>
