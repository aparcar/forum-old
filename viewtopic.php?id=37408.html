					<p>I added the exact text as explained in the relevant hardware section.&nbsp; Having&nbsp; read the syntax guide i can tell ther are no problems with that.</p><p>That probably just leaves the fact that I didn&#039;t edit &#039;option ifname &quot;ethX&quot;&#039; accordingly (eth0.1, eth0.2) as i didnt understand it.</p><p>Does it make sense that If i edited the config file as suggested but missed out the &#039;option ifname &quot;ethX&quot;&#039; edit that OpenWrt woudl fall over?</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Jon</p>									</div>
