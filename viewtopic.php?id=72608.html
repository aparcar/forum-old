					<p>hello, i&#039;ve read the web and tried different things for hours, but i can&#039;t log into my device.<br />I flashed my tp link archer c7 with openwrt about a year ago and forgot the root password. Now i need to do a factory reset or resest the users password. after bringing the router in failsafe mode by pressing the hardware button while booting (fast flashing status led), establishing a telnet connection, as&nbsp; descibed in the wiki, fails with &quot;connection failure&quot;. I can ping the device and even connect via ssh, but I can&#039;t log in the root account without the password. i would appreciate if anyone could help me.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pwebe</strong> on 22 Nov 2017, 12:14)</p>

					<p>I&#039;ve tried the wiki tutorial already. The status led is blinking like crazy, indicating its in failsafe. Theres no wifi, webinterface or dhcp present. The udp packet on port 4919 can be captured BUT there&#039;s no second multicast packet confirming the failsafe state after pushing the button. Telnet over putty refuses the connection and ssh denies access without the right password.</p><p>EDIT: solved it by flashing the openwrt firmware via tftp</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pwebe</strong> on 22 Nov 2017, 12:13)</p>
