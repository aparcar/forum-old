					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have several routers from a no name manufacturer running on the 53xx board with the following specs:</p><p>CPU: BCM5354KFBG<br />32MB RAM<br />32MB Flash<br />Switch seems to be a couple of these <a href="http://www.witchip.com/pdf/HF03.pdf">http://www.witchip.com/pdf/HF03.pdf</a><br />Wireless: Built-in</p><p>I&#039;m not sure if the boards have a JTAG pinout or not, but I can find out. Unit currently will run dd-wrt so I can ship them with that installed as well.</p><p>Seems like some work has been done on the 5354 already, if any developer wants some more hardware to add support I will gladly donate.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Whitebox</strong> on 16 Apr 2009, 21:57)</p>
