					<p>I was hoping someone you recommend a configuration for me.&nbsp; (I have a wrt54g).&nbsp; Openwrt is installed an running fine.&nbsp; </p><p>I would like to have the following:</p><p>1 - All five ports on the back setup as a switch</p><p>2 - The ability for the wifi connection to&nbsp; MAC filter with the addresses stored on another machine. If the MAC address checks out, you get an ipaddress, and get on the network.&nbsp; If not, I don&#039;t know - no IP address, firewalled, whatever is easiest to keep you off the network.</p><br /><p>For #1, the following seemed to work</p><p>vlan0ports=0 1 2 3 4 5*<br />vlan1ports=<br />lan_ifnames=vlan0 eth1 eth2 eth3<br />wan_ifnames=vlan1</p><p>For #2, I&#039;m at a bit of a loss.&nbsp; The MAC filtering thing looks like it&#039;s all done locally on the wrt54g.</p><p>Thanks to anyone who can point me in the right direction.</p>									</div>

					<p>It looks like the MAC filter needs to be done with chillispot and freeradius.&nbsp; I&#039;ll go look again in the docs</p>									</div>

					<p>In my opinion mac filter is useless. If someone wants to crack your network, it will at best slow him a bit down (if someone cracks the WEP/WPA key, he can easily use some known mac address from the captured packets).</p><p>I don&#039;t know any ready to use solutions for #2. Could radius do the job?</p>									</div>
