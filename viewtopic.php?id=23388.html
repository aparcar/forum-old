					<p>I have external binaries (that have their own built system built) for the OpenWrt running device that I have, is there an easy way to copy these binaries, their config files etc to some directory in the kamikaze built environment to get them bundled in the root filesystem (root.squashfs) so I do not need to wget all of them from my server every time I boot the device?</p><p>Just in case it is relevant, my device is ppc40x (kilauea)</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes. Just put them under the <em>files</em> sud-directory sturcture on your OpenWRT main root directory. For instance, if you want to include /usr/lib/libfile.so.1.2.3 file, you would copy this file to files/usr/lib/libfile.so.1.2.3 under your OpenWRT directory. This way, the compilation process will include the /usr/lib/libfile.so.1.2.3 file to the built firmware.</p>									</div>
