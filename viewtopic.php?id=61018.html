This program will help you determine which kernel modules you need
to load to use lm_sensors most effectively. It is generally safe
and recommended to accept the default answers to all questions,
unless you know what you&#039;re doing.

Some south bridges, CPUs or memory controllers contain embedded sensors.
Do you want to scan for them? This is totally safe. (YES/no):
failed to find a module named cpuid
Module cpuid loaded successfully.

    (driver `via-cputemp&#039;)

Some Super I/O chips contain embedded sensors. We have to write to
standard I/O ports to probe them. This is usually safe.
Do you want to scan for Super I/O sensors? (YES/no):
Probing for Super-I/O at 0x2e/0x2f
Trying family `National Semiconductor/ITE&#039;...               No
Trying family `SMSC&#039;...                                     No
Trying family `VIA/Winbond/Nuvoton/Fintek&#039;...               Yes
Found `VIA VT1211 Super IO Sensors&#039;
    (address 0xec00, but not activated)
Probing for Super-I/O at 0x4e/0x4f
Trying family `National Semiconductor/ITE&#039;...               No
Trying family `SMSC&#039;...                                     No
Trying family `VIA/Winbond/Nuvoton/Fintek&#039;...               No
Trying family `ITE&#039;...                                      No

Some systems (mainly servers) implement IPMI, a set of common interfaces
through which system health data may be retrieved, amongst other things.
We first try to get the information from SMBIOS. If we don&#039;t find it
there, we have to read from arbitrary I/O ports to probe for such
interfaces. This is normally safe. Do you want to scan for IPMI
interfaces? (YES/no):
Probing for `IPMI BMC KCS&#039; at 0xca0...                      No
Probing for `IPMI BMC SMIC&#039; at 0xca8...                     No

Some hardware monitoring chips are accessible through the ISA I/O ports.
We have to write to arbitrary I/O ports to probe them. This is usually
safe though. Yes, you do have ISA I/O ports even if you do not have any
ISA slots! Do you want to scan the ISA I/O ports? (YES/no):
Probing for `National Semiconductor LM78&#039; at 0x290...       No
Probing for `National Semiconductor LM79&#039; at 0x290...       No
Probing for `Winbond W83781D&#039; at 0x290...                   No
Probing for `Winbond W83782D&#039; at 0x290...                   No

Lastly, we can probe the I2C/SMBus adapters for connected hardware
monitoring devices. This is the most risky part, and while it works
reasonably well on most systems, it has been reported to cause trouble
on some systems.
Do you want to probe the I2C/SMBus adapters now? (YES/no):
Using driver `i2c-viapro&#039; for device 0000:00:11.0: VIA Technologies VT8237 South Bridge
failed to find a module named i2c-viapro
Module i2c-viapro loaded successfully.


Now follows a summary of the probes I have just done.
Just press ENTER to continue:

Driver `via-cputemp&#039;:
  * Chip `VIA C7 thermal sensor&#039; (confidence: 9)

Do you want to overwrite /etc/sysconfig/lm_sensors? (YES/no):
Copy prog/init/lm_sensors.init to /etc/init.d/lm_sensors
for initialization at boot time.
You should now start the lm_sensors service to load the required
kernel modules.
