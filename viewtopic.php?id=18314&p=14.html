					<p>RTL most probably stands for Realtek - vendor of network chips, sound chips and embedded processors. Realtek.com.tw website</p><p>632 and 652 were on Atheros revisions 1.0 and 1.0, bur revision 2.0 comes on R-somthing. Probably Realtek as well. Or maybe RALink, dont remember.<br />PS: here confirmation: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/trendnet/tew652brp10r">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/trendnet/tew652brp10r</a></p><p>And now there is even 652 version 3.x! <a href="http://trendnet.ru/products/catalog/detail/TEW-652BRPv3x">http://trendnet.ru/products/catalog/det … -652BRPv3x</a></p><p>PS: those routers are running Linux.<br />It is just not community-driven Linux.</p><p>I only had 632/652 revision 1.x<br />There you could just save config on the router Tools Webadmin page.<br />This config could be unpacked by 7-zip (or maybe it even was not compressed, do not remember) and then displayed as text with for example Notepad++</p><p>I think it is still the same because, u know, just why they would change it ?</p><p>Why u talk of drivers ? Network settings are not mantained by drivers.<br />FreeBSD (and routers fw based on it) uses their script set.<br />On desktop Linux usually RedHat /etc/netconfig scripts are used. They are ugly but widespread used and supported. Including support from GUI wizards like NetManager<br />On AltLinux /etc/net scripts are used, which are great for wired net, but not very good for Wi-Fi<br />*WRT are targeted on machines small by CPU and by Memory - so they have their only little-size network scripts.</p><p>What are used in Trendnet ? Dunno, unpack thei firmware and look inside :-)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>annoynimous</strong> on 1 Nov 2011, 22:33)</p>

					<p>Greetings from a Newbie here on the board with a question from Columbus, Ohio:</p><p>I have TEW-652BRP that works fine EXCEPT it does not permit loop back. Since I&#039;m running a web server, it would be nice to be able to see the server via DNS from the LAN side of the house. Folks on the WAN have no problem seeing my pages.</p><p>Can the config.BIN file be modified to allow this?</p><p>Any and all suggestions would be helpful</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Dave in Columbus, Oh</p>									</div>

					<p>I have a weird problem with a tew-652brp v3.2R (3.02b02), original: 3.00b13<br />After i bought it, it worked great for about 3 weeks then the problems started:<br />The first few days the wireless would just randomly turn off and i had to reboot it.<br />After a few days if i try to restart after the wireless was gone all the leds (except the wlan) are always on and the unit is basically bricked for 3-4 days ( if i try to power it in that interval the same story with the led&#039;s ) after 3-4 days have passed i power the router and it works just fine for 2hours-24 hours then the fun starts all over again.</p><p>When it first started doing this i waited for it to work and flashed it with 3.02b02 hoping for a miracle and it worked for about 24-48 hours then it started again...</p><p>P.S. while all the leds are on i can&#039;t even get it in recovery mode... (if i try to put it in recovery mode i can get a connection but no packets are being sent by the router)</p><p>I even tried opening it to see if it&#039;s too hot and that&#039;s not the case, at some point after it acted up i put it in a bag and threw it in the freezer for 5 minutes and nothing... still all the leds but the wireless constantly on...</p><p>Any ideea what i can do ( besides returning it / warranty / tech support - don&#039;t ask why... )</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mad</strong> on 13 Oct 2012, 20:11)</p>
