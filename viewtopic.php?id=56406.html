					<p>I&#039;ll write up my results on this relay bridge-setup, as a reference.</p><br /><p>Regarding the setup, the openwrt script from the wiki is exactly what I wanted, where all my bridged clients<br />are wired to the relaying router (in my case Archer C7 AC1750 v2)</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient</a></p><p>The way I found best to approach the configuration is to startup a flashed router and<br />access it (eth1) on 192.168.1.1 though the browser. The browser will make it esay to scan for a 2G or 5G<br />network (whatever it is we want to bridge to) and Internet connection can be made on the router.<br />After configuring a wifi-conecction, through scan, and setting password in the browser, I found it best to<br />transition to terminal on ssh</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ssh root@192.168.1.1</p><p>We should have an internet connection here, and able to use opkg, thus</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; opkg update<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; opkg install relay<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; opkg install luci-proto-relay&nbsp; (not strictly necessary, but you&#039;ll want it to browse your setup later)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; opkg nano</p><br /><p>The most important files changes are</p><p>/etc/config/network<br /># the eth1 must be static and transparent, it must also communicate the IP of the bridged access-point</p><p>&nbsp; config interface &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;192.168.1.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option gateway &#039;192.168.0.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option dns &#039;192.168.0.1&#039;</p><p>&nbsp; config interface &#039;w5g&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;dhcp&#039;</p><p>&nbsp; config interface &#039;relay&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;relay&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; list network &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; list network &#039;w5g&#039;</p><br /><p>/etc/config/wireless<br /># bridging on the 802.11n 5G, choosing w5g as the network name, matching above</p><p>&nbsp; config wifi-device &#039;radio0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option type &#039;mac80211&#039;</p><p>&nbsp; config wifi-iface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option network &#039;w5g&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;radio0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ssid &#039;ssid-name&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option encryption &#039;psk2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option mode &#039;sta&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option key &#039;passwd&#039;</p><br /><p>/etc/config/dhcp<br /># turn off eth1/lan dhcp</p><p>&nbsp; config dhcp &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ignore &#039;1&#039;</p><br /><p>/etc/config/firewall<br /># liberal firewall rules, more refinent may be achieved but this will work</p><p>&nbsp; config zone<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option name &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option input &#039;ACCEPT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option output &#039;ACCEPT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option forward &#039;ACCEPT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option network &#039;lan w5g&#039;</p><br /><br /><p>------------------------------------</p><br /><p>The youtube video that was posted below has flaws in it and bugged me quite a bit.

I don&#039;t quite know what the trick is. </p><p>I tried the &#039;masquerade&#039; script here <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedclient">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedclient</a></p><p>But I don&#039;t have the &#039;broadcom&#039; option, and not sure it matters ... I put option &#039;type&#039; &#039;mac80211&#039; instead ...</p><p>Maybe it&#039;s got something to do with the traffic forwarding, or static routes configuration?</p><p>I&#039;m not confident if the static ip should be on a separate subnet, or the same as the primary access point, which seems like the first thing to decide. (The WIFI that I&#039;m hooking up to uses 192.168.0.1, and I stuck to 192.168.1.1 on the openwrt, and the wlan0 configuration on the openwrt got assigned on this subnet 192.168.0.x)</p><p>Well ... advice appreciated&nbsp; (would be good to find a solution before I wear out the reset button on the back)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hoffrj</strong> on 22 Mar 2015, 23:28)</p>

					<p>Hi ckm/others,</p><p>Thanks for that link, I followed it and seem to have made some progress, it&#039;s like I&#039;m almost there .. </p><p>I defined a wlan interface to the existing wifi, it connects and gets an ip, and I defined a &#039;relay&#039; like in the script</p><p>Now, if my LAN is on a different subnet, e.g. 192.168.1.1 and my WLAN got assigned in my case 192.168.0.110. It doesn&#039;t work like this, but when I switched the LAN over to 192.168.0.35, it seems to work intermittently</p><p>I get Internet connection initially, but the connection to the router becomes lost on this IP. Then after a while the Internet dropped, and I could get back on the router again.</p><p>When I was on the router like this in the last case, the WLAN is down also from within the router (with ssh on), the DNS doesn&#039;t seem to translate. When I switch my router back to 192.168.1.1 and ssh on, the WLAN is OK again, but not through the LAN</p><p>I feel I&#039;m close .. but there is still some pieces of the puzzle missing?</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I think I can answer most of my own query ... </p><p>For the relay setup, the lan ip should be outside the wifi-subnet, my wifi is on 192.168.0.x, I think I got a stable configuration now leaving the router lan-inteface on 192.168.1.1</p><p>I was missing these vital parts in /etc/config/network</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; config &#039;interface&#039; &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option gateway &#039;192.168.0.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option dns &#039;192.168.0.1&#039;</p><p>I got it from the details here <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient</a> (The video tutorial seems to me to suggest they should be on the same, which is on odds with the manual)</p><p>I have at least one more important question ... </p><p><em>I can&#039;t access the openwrt anymore over the relay, is there trick here?</em> (not without changing the ip on the adapter setting)(setting the relay-ip didn&#039;t seem to do anything)</p>									</div>
