					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>I&#039;m posting here after trying to setup a VPN client with OpenWrt.</p><p>I have the following setup:<br />- 1 router (A) TP-Link WR741N with original firmware, connected to internet via PPoE<br />- 1 router (B) TP-Link WR710N with original firmware, connected to the previous router (A) via WiFi in client mode<br />- 1 router (C) TP-Link WR703N with OpenWrt, connected to the previous router (B) via Ethernet, on which I would like to setup a PPTP client</p><p>I tried to do a simple configuration of the WR703N, bridging the LAN and WLAN cards, and un-ticking the case &quot;this is the only DHCP server on the network&quot; (as I guess the router A should be the main DHCP?)/</p><p>I faced several issues:<br />- I have internet on my laptop, connected via WiFi to router C, however, when I SSH to router C, it doesn&#039;t have internet<br />- It seems it is a DNS issue. When I ping a host, it says &quot;ping: bad address &#039;xxx&#039;&quot;. I checked /etc/resolv.conf, and it was set as &quot;domain lan / nameserver 127.0.0.1&quot;<br />- It seems I had a dnsmasq service running on the router, although I didn&#039;t activate it. Is this normal? I tried to deactivate, then force the DNS to Google&#039;s DNS, and succeed to get internet on the router<br />- I tried to set the DNS server as 192.168.1.1, but then the network was down again<br />- Then I tried to reach the main router (192.168.1.1), but it didn&#039;t work, either from the router or my computer<br />- Now, I can&#039;t get internet on the router anymore, even when forcing the DNS to 8.8.8.8<br />- I used to try to connect to PPTP connection using dd-wrt, but it didn&#039;t work (though everything else working). I decided to switch to OpenWrt to see if it could work better (and I guess the performances are better for these small devices on OpenWrt). I still haven&#039;t tried to connect the VPN using OpenWrt as I don&#039;t have any internet on the router anyway</p><p>Any advice/troubleshot procedure for this setup?</p><p>Cheers!</p>									</div>
