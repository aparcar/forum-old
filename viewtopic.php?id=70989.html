					<p>Hi all,</p><p>It appears from some research that Ubiquiti may have started proactively blocking the installation of 3rd Party Firmware on their WiFi Devices.</p><p>We have experienced this issue on the Ubiquiti UAP V2 and Ubiquiti themselves have refused to officially confirm or deny that they are.</p><p>As we are a sizeable Wireless Operator who, to-date, have used Ubiquiti kit extensively within our predominately Open Source infrastructure, this will cause us some issues!</p><p>Does anyone else have any knowledge or experience of this situation?</p><p>Regards,<br />Peter R-F</p>									</div>
