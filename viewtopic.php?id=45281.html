					<p>I have installed&nbsp; Backfire on my WRT54G. I will be travelling abroad soon, so I would like to setup the VPN.</p><p>Aside from the obvious access to my LAN machines, I want my Internet access to go through the router as well (NO split tunnelling on my laptop). In other words, the IP on my Windows laptop should appear as the WAN IP address of the router (I hope I am clear, lol).</p><p>Which guide should I follow?<br />Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>just to confirm, the OpenVPN client is not a split-tunnelling solution, correct? That is, once the tunnel established, all the traffic&nbsp; from the client to the Internet will go through my home connection, right?</p><p>Example, remote client has public IP 1.1.1.1; my home connection has public IP 2.2.2.2</p><p>When the remote client initiates connection to google.com, all the traffic is routed through the tunnel to my OpenWRT, which forwards the traffic to google.com on it&#039;s WAN port, so Google.com sees the request coming from 2.2.2.2. Then google.com responds to 2.2.2.2 (my router), and the router forwards the response packet to the remote client over the VPN tunnel. Is that correct?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>djrh</strong> on 16 Jul 2013, 22:32)</p>
