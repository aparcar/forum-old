					<p>Hi, first you have to explain what kind of settings are looking for. For example, I do not need the relayd to make a bridge between WLAN and LAN (WAN access is other, no wireless). In this case, how to is:<br />1. Create a wireless access point, with a new interface called wlan.<br />2. Go to LAN interface, physical settings, add check bridge with wlan.<br />(3. check that wlan is together lan on firewall settings)</p><p>I think that I try to do same but check &quot;lan&quot; interface on wireless initial settings, but I think remember that it give me some mistake (also, no try to do bridge from WLAN interface, or you have a broken wired lan). With this simple bridge, you extend your local wired network to wireless interface. That interface say &quot;unsupported protocol&quot; is safe, because WLAN is managed by LAN directly (clients get ip over local network from same dhcp server) and WLAN clients have same access to WAN network.</p><p>Regards.</p>									</div>

					<p>important thing, your LAN address must be in a different subnet of main router (in your case 192.168.1.1), like you can see here:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient</a></p><p>you see that LAN port has 192.168.2.1 (red address) while main AP has 192.168.1.1 (blue address) <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

My plan (share wifi and lan on same router):</p><p>WAN &lt;- MR3220 -&gt; LAN + WLAN</p><p>But I think that you talk about this other case (share wan from another main router):</p><p>WAN &lt;- WIFI-ROUTER &lt;-&gt; WLAN &lt;- MR3220 -&gt; LAN<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;^<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LAN</p><p>In this second case, sure my comments do not help: check relayclient (although still a little confusing for a newbie). However, same that say nebia88 &quot;If the target network uses the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet, you must change the default LAN IP address to a different subnet, e.g. 192.168.2.1&quot; (192.168.1.2 is not a valid address on relay).</p><p>Regards.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, If you don&#039;t have difficulties with the failsafe (saving settings before testing is easier), you can try to check &quot;Disable DHCP for this interface.&quot; on LAN interface. Target on a relay client is get dhcp ip from main router.<br />You can see:<br />&quot;Run ifconfig and take note of the IP address assigned to wlan0. Then tell the relayd that this is the routers IP address with the following config.&quot;<br />It&#039;s set on &quot;Local IPv4 address&quot; on relay protocol page (not in the tutorial with an old version of luci).<br />Regards.</p>									</div>
