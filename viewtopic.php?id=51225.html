					<p>to recover just power off, than on and keep pressing any button on your router (but dont hold, just push-release-push-release-...)<br />than router should stop on 192.168.1.1 and you can telnet into him, there you can follow this: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe#in.failsafe.mode">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/gener â€¦ lsafe.mode</a></p><p>for wlan client have a look there: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>TCr</strong> on 22 Jun 2014, 01:15)</p>

					<p>Yes, I saw that page, but I&#039;am lost..<br />There are few options, and I&#039;am realy newbie in this thread.</p><p>Also, I forgot to write, One of my routers are DSL modem, and i can&#039;t soft it to WRT.<br />I want that one to use as a modem and router. The oter one (with WRT soft)<br />should work like wifi repeater or bridge to this one.</p><p>I read few articles, that this is possible, and the only thing i need is IP adress and MAC adress from first router.</p>									</div>
