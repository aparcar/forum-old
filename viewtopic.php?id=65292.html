					<p>I&#039;m trying to assign 3 public IP addresses to my WAN interface (eth0.1). What I&#039;m trying to do is route traffic to a OpenWrt for VPN, a web server, and an SFTP server using Port Forwards. I have my Port Forwards set up and if I change the IP of my WAN interface to match the Port Forward, traffic is forwarded to the server with the corresponding private IP address. So, I know my forwards work.</p><p>I have tried numerous methods as listed below. </p><p><strong>Round 1:</strong> (this one works until I reload networking or reboot, then only the first IP address is recognized)</p><p>config interface &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth0.2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask &#039;255.255.255.248&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option gateway &#039;50.243.171.110&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option dns &#039;8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; list ipaddr &#039;50.243.171.109&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; list ipaddr &#039;50.243.171.107&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; list ipaddr &#039;50.243.171.105&#039;</p><p><strong>Round 2:</strong> (total failure)</p><p>config interface &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth0.2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask &#039;255.255.255.248&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option gateway &#039;50.243.171.110&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option dns &#039;8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;50.243.171.109&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;wan1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth0.2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;50.243.171.107&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;wan2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth0.2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;50.243.171.105&#039;</p><p><strong>Round 3:</strong> (yet another total failure)</p><p>config interface &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth0.2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option type &#039;bridge&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask &#039;255.255.255.248&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option gateway &#039;50.243.171.110&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option dns &#039;8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;50.243.171.109&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;wan1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth0.2:1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;50.243.171.107&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;wan2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth0.2:2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;50.243.171.105&#039;</p><p>Not sure if I&#039;m missing something.

					<p>thank you for your response.</p><p>i had to re-make my image to include kmod-macvlan as it wouldn&#039;t install with a kernel dependency error. since my wan interface is on eth0.2 this is what i ran:</p><p>ip link add link eth0.2 eth20 type macvlan</p><p>i then added a new interface using eth20 with a public IP and netmask, but i&#039;m still unable to connect to server from the internet. is there a way to troubleshoot this? I did not receive any errors during the build.</p>									</div>

					<p>^make sure to change the mac address also on that virtual interface or it will be just a mac address that is full of zeroes., just google for a site that can generate a mac address for you.</p><p>and also adjust your firewall setting, just for a test you can temporarily assign it on your wan firewall.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>remlei</strong> on 5 Jun 2016, 12:46)</p>
