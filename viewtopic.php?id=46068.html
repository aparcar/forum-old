					<p>I&#039;d like to know if it&#039;s possible to have one physical interface split in two virtual, by using a standard 8-wire twisted-pair cable, and assigning 4 wires to each interface. In other words, I&#039;d like to connect two end devices to a router having one physical interface, with each device utilizing only 4 wires of an 8-wire cable. Obviously the cable should be split somewhere on the other end, with two 8p8c connectors going to both end devices.</p><p>Now I know I could just add a cheap switch or just use a regular router/switch/ap combo in one device like any sane person would do.</p><p>The reason I&#039;m asking is this: I&#039;ve seen many tiny, USB-powered routers with a wireless interface, but only one physical interface. I&#039;d like to connect two end devices (like TV and STB, both having no wireless interfaces) to such router, without any additional devices connected to mains.</p><p>Now I know that splitting an interface in such fashion sounds bizarre:) I&#039;m curious if anybody has attempted it (or maybe it&#039;s a regular OpenWRT&#039;s feature that I have somehow missed)?</p>									</div>

					<p>i don&#039;t think it&#039;s possible due to the design of the ethernet transciever, it&#039;s not a software problem.</p><p>as an example, have a look to the 8 pins of a wr703n ethernet port:</p><p><a href="http://squonk42.github.io/TL-WR703N/">http://squonk42.github.io/TL-WR703N/</a></p><p>zooming the first diagram you will see that only 4 pins goes to the ETH_TRANSFO, the other 4 are shorted and pulled to GND.</p><br /><br /><p>anyway you could use/build one of these maybe:</p><p><a href="http://www.eeweb.com/blog/circuit_projects/building-a-passive-ethernet-hub">http://www.eeweb.com/blog/circuit_proje â€¦ hernet-hub</a></p><p>at the cost of half duplex communication..</p>									</div>
