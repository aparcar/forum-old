					<p>How can I set my AP to act as a repeater? All how-to:s and forum posts I can find only describe how to reflect one network with an alternative SSID. That I do not want to do. I want to set up a bunch of APs so that they bounce the traffic on to the one &quot;master&quot; that is not set as repeater and connected to the internet.</p><p>Perhaps there are better chooises than OpenWrt for this? I&#039;ll be running it on the &quot;master&quot; AP all the repeaters in the end make sure packages are received to, but that might not matter.</p><p>I&#039;m a complete newbie. Please excuse any poor search skills or so. I didn&#039;t even receive my APs yet, but I&#039;m really hyped to get working with it.</p>									</div>
