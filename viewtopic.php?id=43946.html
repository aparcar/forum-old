					<p>I&#039;m trying to compile the default profile for the Atmel AT91 target system.</p><p>However, when I&#039;m compiling the kernel I get this error:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>rget-arm_v5te_uClibc-0.9.33.2_eabi/linux-at91/zImage-lmu5000
cat: /root/SAM/openwrt/build_dir/target-arm_v5te_uClibc-0.9.33.2_eabi/linux-at91/linux-3.8.11/arch/arm/boot/dts/lmu5000.dtb: No such file or directory
make[5]: *** [install] Error 1</code></pre></div><p>I checked and the lmu5000.dtb file is indeed missing in the whole tree, even thought there&#039;s however a lmu5000.dts file. Not even the buildroot provided by atmel has this dtb file, only dts.</p><p>I&#039;m guessing the dts file (device tree source) has to be compiled to a dtb (device tree blob) but I don&#039;t know why this is not done by the build process itself, should I build it myself? which would be the recomended way?</p><p>I tried enabling CONFIG_TARGET_at91_LMU5000 but this didn&#039;t make any difference.</p><p>Anyone knows what&#039;s going on? do I really need this file? my target system is a at91sama5d3xek</p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Ferk</strong> on 3 May 2013, 13:15)</p>
