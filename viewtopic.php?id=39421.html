					<p>Hi</p><p>Coming form DD-WRT, OpenWRT seems to plaster a noob sign on my forehead .. i seriously dont get it .. i read the FAQs and the steps.. it got me here:<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/</a></p><p>this is supposed to be the latest stable.. and before playing around w/ other hacks i wanted to simply install OpenWRT and get a feel of it.. but my god i dont get it.. w/c one should i install (using the most simple method, via the current router&#039;s built in FW upgrade feature)</p><br /><p>also.. if you guys dont mind, wanted to ask quick questions..&nbsp; i really just wanted openWRT for the following features:</p><p>1) Captive Portal (simple, no external network/hardware dependency.. more like for policy acceptance and advertising perhaps)<br />2) USB Support cause my router, an ASUS RT-N10u, has USB Ports for Print, share, ftp, and even USB Modem<br />3) IP based bandwidth management and monitoring that lets me see or set the exact kbps speeds per client via IP/MAC<br />4) Multi SSID w/ bandwidth profiling per SSID..</p><p>Am I headed in the right direction here?</p>									</div>
