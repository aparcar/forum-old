					<p>The Save Wi-Fi campaign predicted that the FCC rules of late 2015 would result in router vendors locking the firmware to prevent out-of-spec Wi-Fi emissions. Although the FCC indicated that it was not their goal to prevent third-party firmware upgrades, it now appears that this is the outcome.</p><p>Please use this topic to report routers and/or vendors whose firmware is now locked down to third-party software updates. Include the following information:</p><ul><li><p>Purchase date</p></li><li><p>Manufacturer/vendor</p></li><li><p>Model number</p></li><li><p>Version number</p></li><li><p>Identifying info on the package to help people avoid locked-down equipment (UPC code, part number, etc.</p></li><li><p>How you know that they are locked down (personal observation, tried it and it didn&#039;t work (what was the error message?), statement from vendor, etc.)</p></li><li><p>Any links to statements from the vendor</p></li></ul><p>And if you would like to help push back against these FCC rules, visit the <strong>Save WiFi - Round #2</strong> <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/save_wifi_round_2">https://www.gofundme.com/save_wifi_round_2</a> and the Original Save WiFi round<a href="https://www.gofundme.com/savewifi">https://www.gofundme.com/savewifi</a> note</p>									</div>

					<p>New TP-Link Routers now appear all to be locked down as of February 2016. The following chat occurred on the TP-Link support line (Camille is the support rep):</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Camille09:13:25 pm wait one moment please<br />Thanks for your waiting, right now only these products has limitation on<br />firmware: Archer C7 V2 Archer C1900 V1 Touch P5 V1 Archer C2600 V1 Archer<br />C3200 V1 Archer C2 V1 Archer C5 V2 Archer C8 V1 Archer C9 V1 TL-WR841N V11<br />TL-WDR3500 V1 TL-WR940N V3.0 TL-WR1043ND V3.0 TL-WR710N(USA) TL-WR841N V9.0<br />and all products will also limite firmware in the future.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Adam Longwill09:26:19 pm Wow. Thank you. I&#039;m impressed with your digging<br />And this limitation is due to FCC rule clarifications in 2015?<br />And not some other reason</p><p> Camille09:28:15 pm Right, due to FCC</p></blockquote></div><p>The full chat is at <a href="http://ml.ninux.org/pipermail/battlemesh/2016-February/004379.html">http://ml.ninux.org/pipermail/battlemes … 04379.html</a></p>									</div>
