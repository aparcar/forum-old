					<p>I am using Kamikaze and I would like to have the default gateway set at boot. As it is now I have to manually set the gateway when the router boots and change the resolv.conf. Additionally, I have to set the DNS server for the clients by hand as well.<br />How can I configure so that the router knows the default gateway on boot? <br />How can I set it so that on boot the router gives the correct addresses of the DNS servers to the dhcp clients?<br />What I have:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#### WAN configuration

					<p>Still no luck. I&#039;ve switched to giving the two clients static addresses. However, I still have to manually set the gateway route and router ip address by hand. I thought the changes I made in /etc/config/network would do the job but they had no (apparent) effect. I&#039;ve tried a lot of things mentioned here on the forum. I&#039;ve also looked at the dnsmasq info to no (discernible) effect.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>donnied</strong> on 20 Jul 2009, 23:20)</p>
