					<p>Hi!</p><p>I tested my Netgear WNDR 3700v2 with original firmware with 5 wireless stations (clients) on the 2.4GHz band.<br />After about 30 minutes the signal died.<br />5GHz and cable still worked, but the 2.4GHz signal was not detectable by clients any more.</p><p>Is there some data (tests) about number of supported WLAN clients?</p><p>Can I expect different results running OpenWRT?<br />What experiences do other users have?</p><p>Regards,<br />David</p>									</div>

					<p>The WNDR3700 runs OpenWRT when using the factory firmware. It&#039;s a pretty old version though. Attitude_Adjustment or the latest Trunk should perform better.</p>									</div>

					<p>I installed backfire (10.03.1) and it seems to be much better.<br />I connected 6 clients to the WLAN (and one over LAN) and run P2P file exchange (over internet, using popular p2p software) on all of them for about an hour or two.<br />Everything worked fine.</p><p>Although later (when I stopped P2P and disconnected most of the clients) I noticed one client having problems.<br />Windows 8 would report &quot;limited connectivity&quot;. The IP settings were normal, but pinging the router failed. After reconnecting it was OK for some minutes and then the same happened. During that time other WLAN clients had no problems.<br />This happened two maybe 3 times, then I connected the PC with cable.</p><br /><br /><p>PS: All the time I used the 2.4GHz radio and WPA2-PSK security.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>xerces8</strong> on 11 Mar 2013, 11:48)</p>
