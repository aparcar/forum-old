					<p>What, there aren&#039;t any advices? I just don&#039;t believe in that... Should I kneel and beg for help to draw some attention to the topic or what??<br />Please help! Maybe I&#039;m too lame and now got a bricked device, but silence in a place of answer isn&#039;t the best way to communicate, really.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Pointless</strong> on 25 Nov 2011, 20:26)</p>

					<p>The recommendation for TP-Link units is always the same; install a serial cable.<br />There is no software-only way to recover them in case they&#039;re truly bricked.</p><p>If you cannot add a serial cable for whatever reason then rma the unit.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have already installed the rs232 header, but the serial port stopped to work after I flashed the wrong firmware. There is no data output totally. Maybe the baudrate changed? At least on 115200-8-n-1 the output is zero. <br />So that&#039;s why I&#039;m searching for a correct JTAG pinout for the device and a correct procedure to reflash it. <br />And what do you mean under &quot;rma the unit&quot;? To trash it ? Thanks a lot, but I need the device to be at least working as it was on original firmware, i.e. to restore it to unchanged state.<br />I&#039;ve got serial logs from the device booting when it was on the original firmware, as well as the flashing process logs. If anyone needs this info, I can post these.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Pointless</strong> on 30 Nov 2011, 13:59)</p>
