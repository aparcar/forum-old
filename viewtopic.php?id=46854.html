					<p>I would like to use this driver to monitor 3 ADC channels, however this module is not compatible with the kernel since it was written for a 2.6.29 kernel... I&#039;m trying to enable the AT91 Timer/Counter Library with OpenWrt buildroot and it doesn&#039;t exist... is there someone in OpenWrt that has successfully tested this driver?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
