					<p>Hi folks,</p><p>i have a strange behaviour i cannot explain.</p><p>I set up a WRT54G V2.0 with RC4 as a WPA client of a Zyxel Prestige 620. The Wrt acts as a router, with quagga and ripd (which the zyxel supports as well). I do not have or need the firewall, so i deleted the firewall init-script.</p><p>This works just fine until the connection disconnects after about 5 to 10 minutes.</p><p>When i start &quot;/sbin/wifi&quot;, the connection comes up again. I cannot see any messages in the logs or errors with iwconfig.</p><p>Any hints where to look?</p><p>TIA,<br />Stephan</p><p>Here some infos abot my config:<br />----<br />root@hydra:~# nvram show|grep wl0_<br />size: 1190 bytes (31578 left)<br />wl0_akm=psk<br />wl0_infra=1<br />wl0_ifname=eth1<br />wl0_mode=sta<br />wl0_ssid=mu<br />wl0_wpa_psk=&lt;mypasshere&gt;<br />wl0_wep=disabled<br />wl0_wpa_gtk_rekey=1800&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # i changed this. previously it was default 3600, no diff in behaviour.<br />wl0_radio=1<br />wl0_channel=2<br />wl0_crypto=tkip&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />----</p><p>root@hydra:~# nvram show|grep wifi<br />size: 1190 bytes (31578 left)<br />wifi_gateway=10.1.1.1<br />wifi_netmask=255.255.255.0<br />wifi_proto=static<br />wifi_dns=10.1.1.1<br />wifi_ipaddr=10.1.1.2<br />wifi_ifname=eth1<br />root@hydra:~#&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />----</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello again,</p><p>it seems that the interuption happens after half an hour, which is the time interval set as default on the zyxel prestige for reAuthentication. However, this was always like that.&nbsp; I did not mention this in the original post: everything worked with RC3. </p><p>As i erased NVRAM with the migration to RC4 and set up everything from scratch, maybe there was a change in the WPA handling or did i miss some configuration?</p><p>regards,<br />Stephan</p>									</div>

					<p>I seem to be having the same problem, as of this morning. I&#039;m going to torture test it this afternoon by running mythtv on a netbooted box across the wireless link, and see how long it works. Until I found this I had assumed it was some sort of timeout due to inactivity. I&#039;ll report the results here.</p><p>If that doesn&#039;t work, I may have to try wpa_supplicant or xsupplicant, to see if it&#039;s a problem with nas.</p><p>If anyone else has figured this out, please post about it.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Peter</p>									</div>

					<p>Probably unrelated, but I hadn&#039;t yet set up ntp for the date of one of my routers, so if they pass a date rather than TTL, that could be related.</p><p>P</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Peter and all,</p><p>as a workaround i set up an hourly cron job to call /sbin/wifi and ntp. works nicely for me. However, i would prefer to track down the problem, but do not know how to get further.</p><p>Stephan</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cammox</strong> on 1 Dec 2005, 08:33)</p>
