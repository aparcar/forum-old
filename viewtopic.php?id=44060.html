					<p>Hi... which source should be modified to make the power wireless become higher, more than 20dbi ? i heard regulatory.bin should be patched so it can bring more power on wifi.. but how ?<br />i&#039;m looking through all openwrt folder on AA, but didn&#039;t find regulatory.bin.. and where i can find that patched file from internet ?</p>									</div>

					<p>What router do you have? The older Broadcoms are pretty easy to tweak, while the Qualcomm/Atheros ones are next to impossible. (For the latter, you could try backing up the ART and overwriting it with some others, but it more than likely would just reduce performance.)</p>									</div>

					<p>@gentong:<br />Get a better external antenna.<br />Not to get to technical but you have to consider the other devices that will<br />connect to your router, excessive overdriving will cause intermodulation distortion, and may exceed the design limits of your router hardware and also<br />the limts of power based on your countries communication authorities.<br />~john</p>									</div>

					<p>That&#039;s an Atheros unit, so no luck there. Better antennas would be your best bet. (Or an external amplifier, but expect to spend a lot for those...)</p><p>And while it would help a lot to boost both sides, if your use is mostly download, boosting just the router does a lot.</p>									</div>

In the other direction, it can use a lower bitrate encoding that needs much less power. Keep in mind that your cell phone transmits on the order of a few watts at most while the tower is on the order of 50W or more.</p>									</div>
