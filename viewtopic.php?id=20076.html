					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have installed dd-wrt on my Linksys WRT54GL 1.1, but I would like openwrt/kamikaze instead. But the installation-docs says I do need to install Linux 2.4 first, to set &quot;boot_wait=on&quot; and &quot;boot_time=10&quot;. But since I already have dd-wrt (Linux 2.4) I can set the nvram-settings there?</p><p>Do I need a 30-30-30 reset? Since the docs never mention this? And finally: The FAQ at this forum says that wireless does not work on Broadcom? But the installation-docs says I can enable wifi on my WRT54GL. Which one is right?</p><p>-- Sitron_NO</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, going head in first, I tried to install OpenWRT without a answer to my question above. But for the record, I will answer them here:</p><p>30-30-30 reset: You do not need this. An upgrade from DD-WRT (via webinterface worked perfectly). I used the brcm-2.4 kamikaze .bin-file<br />I then set the following nvram-settings: &quot;boot_wait=on&quot; and &quot;boot_time=10&quot; and a &quot;nvram commit &amp;&amp; reboot&quot;. I then had to install the kamikaze (with linux 2.6), but: I had to use the .txn, not the .bin! So download the right file before you start :-)<br />However, I am sure you could set the nvram-settings in DD-WRT and go directly to the brcm (2.6) kamikaze .bin.</p><p>Finally, wireless, with WPA2 (psk), works out of the box!</p>									</div>
