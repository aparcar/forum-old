					<p>Hello, </p><p>I am running backfire 10.03 on my TP-Link TL-WR1043ND router to connect my laptop to the internet. but the wan port really makes me frustrated. The router is directly connected to my ISP via ethernet, so static address need to be configured on the router.</p><p>However, whatever with or without configuration, the router cannot detect the wan connection:&nbsp; the wan port has no light, and it cannot access the internet at all. When running mii-tool on the router, it shows the wan interface hasn&#039;t negotiated successfully (no interface found). I really don&#039;t know what&#039;s happening and how to solve it~</p><p>I am sure there are no mac blocked in my ISP, and when I revert to the stock firmware, the wan port works happily. Then I install OpenWRT, and the problem still exists. My ISP ethernet interface is 1000Mbps, is it referring to line speed?</p><p>Any help? I&#039;ll be appreciating so much~</p>									</div>
