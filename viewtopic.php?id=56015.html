					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve bought an Aukey PB-W1 ( <a href="http://www.aukey.com/product/wireless-router-powerbank-pbw1">http://www.aukey.com/product/wireless-r … rbank-pbw1</a> ) and after discover the crappy firmware, I tried to discover if it&#039;s some clone of one of the supported models. I started to look for some hardware data, and found it has 32MB, and a config.sh file with the following content <a href="http://pastebin.com/1gujcMLG">http://pastebin.com/1gujcMLG</a><br />I&#039;ve found some HAME strings by grepping /dev/mtp0ro so I decided to risk it and flash the MPR2 openwrt version following the instructions in the wiki ( <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/hame/mpr-a2">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/hame/mpr-a2</a> ) and luckly it went well and now I have a fully functional device with an awesome firmware instead the crappy one by default <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>Full dmesg output -&gt; <a href="http://pastebin.com/nhgK8Zk2">http://pastebin.com/nhgK8Zk2</a></p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t think that this will work, because I &#039;ve tried a lot and 16mb is not enough memory for LUCY.

					<p>You may want to consider a Kingstom MLWG2.&nbsp; <br />It has a MediaTek MT7620N SoC with 16M Flash and 64M DDR2 RAM.<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=55077">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=55077</a></p><p>Kingston has come out with a MLWG3 and is dumping these for $30.99 USD shipped to the US (sorry to those abroad).&nbsp; <br />I have not got OpenVPN running as yet, but do on both a HooToo TM-02 and GLI AR-150.&nbsp; Similar processors, but the HooToo is half the GLI and twice the PB-W1 (I think) flash and RAM.&nbsp; My OpenVPN performance went up about 50% on the AR-150, so I guess the Aukey\Hame will be even slower.</p>									</div>
