					<p>Imagine the following situation.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ISP 1 (PUBLIC) &gt; (ETH0) Router VM
ISP 2 (PUBLIC) &gt; (ETHx) OpenWRT
LAN 1 (10.1.0.0) &gt; (ETH1) (10.1.0.1) Router VM
VLAN 2 (10.2.0.0) &gt; (ETH1) (10.2.0.1) Router VM
VLAN 2 (10.2.0.0) &gt; (ETHx) (10.2.0.254) OpenWRT</code></pre></div><p>RouterVM is the main gateway, both for LAN1 and VLAN2.<br />OpenWRT is a second gateway, intended for VPN access when RouterVM fails.<br />OpenWRT <strong>only</strong> needs to have access to VLAN2, it doesn&#039;t matter if the rest of the network is down.</p><p>So, when RouterVM fails, I want to VPN into the OpenWRT router (running a small VPN daemon) and access VLAN2 from there. Seems simple, but I think this can quickly get complicated, because all hosts have a default gateway configured. (RouterVM in this case)</p><p>What I found is that I need some kind of masquerading at OpenWRT’s side. This setup is intended for use when the host running RouterVM fails, I still have a way to access to out of band management. A kind of failover setup, but not quite exactly.</p><p>I came across a wiki article (uci &gt; firewall &gt; masquerading on lan section), but it still isn’t clear to me.</p><p>Can someone explain how this could be done?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>omni</strong> on 10 Nov 2016, 02:53)</p>

					<p>Set on the OpenWRT router any IP from VLAN 2 range, turn off dhcp on it, connect it to VLAN 2 network. You can always connect to this network via VPN and get access to clients from this network. Default GW on clients doesn&#039;t matter, because OpenWRT router has IP from this network.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ulmwind</strong> on 13 Nov 2016, 00:05)</p>
