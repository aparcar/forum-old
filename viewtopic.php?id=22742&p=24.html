					<p>LinkZ - thanks for your answer. Actually i have the latest stable release on my TP-Link (Backfire). What i do not understand: 1) Is it possible to extend the flash memory with an ext2-usb stick in order to have more space for packages 2) what packages do i need to install</p><p>with the original firmware i tryed to copy from an usb-stick over gbit to my laptop. i did not get more then 5 to 7 MB/s (usb-&gt;tp-&gt;Laptop). the usb-stick connected to my laptop works much faster &gt;&gt; 15 MB/s from usb to laptop. Is the poor usb-performance a limitation from the hardware or is it a firmware issue? Is the WNDR3700 faster?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br/>I just bought a WR1043ND and flashed it with the latest OpenWrt trunk. The device itself works like a charm but I am not able get wireless working properly. It&#039;s not my first OpenWrt device so I am generally familiar with OpenWrt.<br/>I set up wireless with wpa2 and I am able to connect to it, but I have terrible high packet loss. TCP data transfers between the WR1043ND and my notebook are just about 10 KB/s so not usable at all. With another 802.11n accesspoint (linksys) I can send and receive at ~8 MB/s which is quite good.<br/>Other users who posted in this thread mentioned something about 5 MB/s which would be okay.
