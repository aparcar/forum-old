					<p>WT3020 is a really tiny, cheap and yet powerful device and I have this idea that it would be very cool to embed a small LCD display in it. I think this could be used for different kinds of projects.</p><p>On the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/nexx/wt3020">wiki</a> it is stated that the device has 4 unused GPIOs.</p><p>On ebay there are cheap tiny 128X64 OLED displays with <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/SSD1306.pdf">SSD1306 controller</a>. <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Blue-0-96-IIC-I2C-128X64-OLED-LCD-Display-Module-Arduino-STM32-AVR-51-/181738693415?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item2a50786327">here is an example</a></p><p>So my thinking is would it be possible to communicate with such display through the GPIOS?</p><p>These displays support either SPI or I2C. I think it would be best to use the I2C bus because then you have 2 GPIOs left for other things like buttons, switches, leds...</p><p>My question is what would be the steps involved to get this I2C display working on WT3020 running Openwrt?</p><br /><p>I have found the ssd1306 I2C linux driver <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/drivers/video/fbdev/ssd1307fb.c">http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/dr â€¦ sd1307fb.c</a></p><p>So the steps to achieve my goal would be:</p><p>1. Need to modify pull-down GPIOs to pull-up.<br />2. Need to establish I2C bus over gpio <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/port.i2c">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/port.i2c</a><br />3. Need to make ssd1306 driver use I2C bus<br />4. Need an example on how to display something on the connected display.</p><p>Is my reasoning correct? </p><p><strong>I do not know how to do step 3</strong>. I asked around and it was mentioned that I might need a custom device tree overlay. But I don&#039;t have knowledge on how device tree and overlays work. Can somebody step in with any links or explanations or examples?</p><p>I do not know how to do step 4 either but I think I could adapt the Adafruit example programs for ssd1306 on raspberry pi?</p><p>I think it would be really great to get this working so I will really appreciate any input from you all!</p><p>Thank you in advance <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pingo</strong> on 15 May 2015, 14:41)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the suggestion. Those displays are a different kind though and too big for my needs.</p>									</div>
