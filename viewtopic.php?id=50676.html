					<p>I&#039;m an OpenWRT newbie and have installed OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment 12.09 (LuCI 0.11.1 Release (0.11.1)) on a TP-LINK TL-WDR4300 dual band router which connects to my ISP via PPPoE.</p><p>I am pretty happy with everything, however I do have an issue in that my internet connection is regularly dropped. The router does immediately re-connect but this causes issues with streamed media and skype calls.</p><p>People in the Google+ forum have helped me locate logs the logs on my router, but the output is meaningless to me and I&#039;m hoping someone can help interpret them and hopefully help me fix the issue. The basic router provided by my ISP works perfectly and does not drop the connection. My router was connected for several months with the stock firmware without dropping the connection once (so it&#039;s not a mac address thing or a router hardware issue). Since installing OpenWRT the connection is dropped every hour or so, sometimes every few minutes (plugging in my old router again solves the issue).</p><p>An extract from my log, before my connection goes down to when it is back up is below. I&#039;m suspecting the issue is something to do with the No response to 5 echo-requests, but what does this mean? When things are running smoothly the log sees to be full of nothing but DHCP packet received on eth0.2 which has no address, so that seems to be always there.</p><p>May 17 15:08:44 Mayfield-Internet daemon.warn dnsmasq-dhcp[7259]: DHCP packet received on eth0.2 which has no address<br />May 17 15:09:05 Mayfield-Internet daemon.info pppd[701]: No response to 5 echo-requests<br />May 17 15:09:05 Mayfield-Internet daemon.notice pppd[701]: Serial link appears to be disconnected.<br />May 17 15:09:05 Mayfield-Internet daemon.info pppd[701]: Connect time 34.4 minutes.<br />May 17 15:09:05 Mayfield-Internet daemon.info pppd[701]: Sent 3347662 bytes, received 46140253 bytes.<br />May 17 15:09:05 Mayfield-Internet daemon.notice pppd[701]: Connection terminated.<br />May 17 15:09:05 Mayfield-Internet daemon.notice netifd: Interface &#039;wan&#039; has lost the connection<br />May 17 15:09:05 Mayfield-Internet user.info firewall: removing wan (pppoe-wan) from zone wan<br />May 17 15:09:08 Mayfield-Internet daemon.warn dnsmasq[7259]: no servers found in /tmp/resolv.conf.auto, will retry<br />May 17 15:09:08 Mayfield-Internet daemon.warn dnsmasq-dhcp[7259]: DHCP packet received on eth0.2 which has no address<br />May 17 15:09:11 Mayfield-Internet daemon.warn dnsmasq-dhcp[7259]: DHCP packet received on eth0.2 which has no address<br />May 17 15:09:14 Mayfield-Internet daemon.warn dnsmasq-dhcp[7259]: DHCP packet received on eth0.2 which has no address<br />May 17 15:09:35 Mayfield-Internet daemon.info pppd[701]: PPP session is 19658<br />May 17 15:09:35 Mayfield-Internet daemon.warn pppd[701]: Connected to 00:14:a9:68:d0:10 via interface eth0.2<br />May 17 15:09:35 Mayfield-Internet daemon.info pppd[701]: Using interface pppoe-wan<br />May 17 15:09:35 Mayfield-Internet daemon.notice pppd[701]: Connect: pppoe-wan &lt;--&gt; eth0.2<br />May 17 15:09:36 Mayfield-Internet daemon.info pppd[701]: CHAP authentication succeeded<br />May 17 15:09:36 Mayfield-Internet daemon.notice pppd[701]: CHAP authentication succeeded<br />May 17 15:09:36 Mayfield-Internet daemon.notice pppd[701]: peer from calling number 00:14:A9:68:D0:10 authorized<br />May 17 15:09:36 Mayfield-Internet daemon.notice pppd[701]: local&nbsp; IP address 94.126.194.168<br />May 17 15:09:36 Mayfield-Internet daemon.notice pppd[701]: remote IP address 94.126.195.254<br />May 17 15:09:36 Mayfield-Internet daemon.notice pppd[701]: primary&nbsp; &nbsp;DNS address 4.2.2.3<br />May 17 15:09:36 Mayfield-Internet daemon.notice pppd[701]: secondary DNS address 4.2.2.4<br />May 17 15:09:36 Mayfield-Internet daemon.notice netifd: Interface &#039;wan&#039; is now up<br />May 17 15:09:37 Mayfield-Internet daemon.warn dnsmasq-dhcp[7259]: DHCP packet received on eth0.2 which has no address</p><p>Also, if anybody can advise how to make the log bigger, or save it as a file (at the moment it seems to be pretty short) if it could be saved on my NAS that would be great.</p><p>Any assistance will be greatly appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks 3zl. I tried sshing into my router and typing syslogd -R 192.168.123.251/Temporary/Router.log</p><p>But, a router.log file has not been created in the Temporary folder on my NAS at 192.168.123.251. Not sure what I&#039;ve done wrong there.</p><p>I have managed to capture several instances of my connection being dropped however, and in each instance there is the daemon.info pppd[701]: No response to 5 echo-requests item in the log followed by the daemon.notice pppd[701]: Serial link appears to be disconnected. So, whatever these things mean, they are the problem!</p>									</div>

					<p>I think this issue may be a bug either with OpenWRT or with Luci. The default setting in Luci / Network / Interfaces / Wan / Advanced Settings for the LCP echo failure threshold is 0, ignore failures.</p><p>This is obviously not happening, I have set this number to a high value, 500, and so far my connection has been stable for almost 24hrs - so seems to be working :-)</p>									</div>
