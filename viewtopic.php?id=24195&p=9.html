					<p>Going through this thread, it&#039;s not clear to me...&nbsp; I&#039;m about to purchase a Netgear DGN3500 second hand. I need to be able to connect to the internet using ADSL 2+ on a PPPoE connection. Does the latest OpenWRT firmware fully support it or not ? Or will it take me 1 week of fiddling around to get it properly working ? It only says on the wiki page: &quot;adsl it&#039;s fully working with pppoa connection&quot;....</p><p>My other worry is, and I love feedback from anyone who&#039;s been using it, there&#039;s a lot of talk about connections lost with the DGN3500. Bad reviews all over the place regarding this router. Does the OpenWRT firmware fix this issue in any way ? </p><p>Much thanks in advance for your replies.

					<p>Hello. I juste got a DGN3500 annex A router, flashed it with OpenWrt and also updated the DSL FW as per post #144. So far so good , even though j haven&#039;t tried my dsl connection yet... Assuming it will be fine ! </p><p>I do have weird things going on with my LEDS however ! I.e wifi staying orange, not turning green, power led not lighting up (although) I checked the &quot;default state&quot; in Luci interface and it seems to have turned it on.</p><p>I don&#039;t quite understand all the settings for the LEDs, triggers and such. If anyone else having the same router could share their led configurations ? That would be great !!!

					<p>Hi everyone</p><p>I tried OpenWrt, I got WAN (nas0) up:</p><p>Status: UP<br />Line State: showtime_tc_sync [0x801]<br />Line Speed: 12.477 Mb/s / 1.022 Mb/s<br />Line Attenuation: 25.4 dB / 9.2 dB<br />Noise Margin: 7 dB / 9.2 dB</p><p>My stumbling block is I cannot ping IPs or ping from LuCI diagnostics.&nbsp; The System log shows my problem (I believe) as &quot;Timeout waiting for PADO packets&quot; after it tries to negotiate PPPoE.</p><p>I google that, but I get minimal and sketchy advice to users who have had the same problem.</p><p>I was on openwrt-15.05-lantiq-xway-DGN3500-squashfs-factory-WW.img</p><p>From a router reset, I do the following:<br /></p><ul><li><p>Change root password,<br />Set gateway address as 192.168.1.1,<br />Set DNS server as 192.168.1.1,<br />Set ADSL username in WAN interface<br />Set ADSL password in WAN interface<br />Set LLC in interfaces section,<br />Set VPI as 8 in interfaces section,<br />Set VCI as 35 in interfaces section.</p></li></ul><p>Am I correct to derive that DNS does not matter if PPPoE negotiation fails?</p><p>What can I do further to try and resolve the PPPoE negotiation issue?</p><p>To communicate with you guys, I had to follow the brutal debrick procedure.&nbsp; The finger reset button did not work on my DGN3500, but the reset button below the hole that you have to prod with a paperclip did work fine.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t even have to reload settings, it seems OpenWrt did not overwrite the original firmware settings.</p><p>However.&nbsp; The Netgear recovery tool reports a failure after it performs the flash, saying it could not complete.&nbsp; So while the router works perfectly well on the original firmware after the OpenWrt flash and revert back to original firmware via the brutal procedure, I think all is not well in the land of the flash layout anymore.&nbsp; I tried reflashing the firmware from the original firmware upgrade page, but it reports more or less the same.&nbsp; But still, at the moment the DGN3500 works, I&#039;m on the net posting to everyone through it, so whatever is broken might not be in use.</p><p>Any help would be super greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>									</div>

DGN3500 or DGN3500<strong>B</strong>?<br />And what&#039;s your ISP?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi chainofflowers</p><p>Correct - the recovery tool mentioned in the debrick procedure.&nbsp; OK, I won&#039;t worry about it.&nbsp; The procedure worked successfully for me on the LAN port closest to the power button, which for me is LAN 1 as far as marking on my router goes.&nbsp; Also, the reset button under the hole worked for me, the button you can press with your finger did not make my router enter a debrickable mode.&nbsp; And the stock fw image I went back to is DGN3500-V1.1.00.33_1.00.33.img - if I remember correctly it&#039;s the WW version, as I believe the North America version is newer, but I&#039;m on the other side of the world.</p><p>My exact model is the DGN3500.</p><p>My ISP is webafrica.</p><p>The reason I&#039;m going the openwrt way is my wireless seems to be dropping out about twice a day, which it has not done before a month ago.&nbsp; The router needs a reboot when this happens, and that makes for much unpleasantness and waste of human life waiting.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping the post 144 wireless firmware change will make things better.</p>									</div>
