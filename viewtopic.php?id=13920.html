					<p>I am interested too in te Netgear WGR614 (I have a v7 here) (note, this is not the *K*WGR). What is the status of this? I can see it is Atheros 2317 based. Is is supported? Is it enough to select the atheros target when building kamikaze?</p><p>Thank you</p>									</div>

					<p>I have both the WGR and the KWGR - the KWGR seems to be targeted at the hobbyist to upload their own firmware which is a nice policy from Netgear <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>It does appear however that alternatives such as DD-WRT have a lot more support and stuff going on that OpenWRT which if it is true is a huge shame as OpenWRT has always been a much nicer option - it just needs more published builds for specific hardware to help newbies (like me) get started <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>You say dd-wrt has explicit support for this router? Afaik dd-wrt uses the openwrt kernel so if it is supported there it must be working here also <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>where have you read this router is working with other firmwares?</p>									</div>
