					<p>Perhaps someone could give me a hint how you can connect to the serial port of WAG320N?<br />Only information about working serial port on this unit I&#039;ve found is pseudonym404&#039; post (<a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=102924#p102924">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php â€¦ 24#p102924</a>) containing output from console.<br />So far I&#039;ve confirmed location of 3.3V (pin 1) and GND (pin 4) signals on J5 connector but after this no luck (still trying). Unfortunately it seems that either I&#039;m simply searching in wrong place or you have to solder additional elements (possible R154, R155, R173).</p><p>P.S. I don&#039;t care about DSL or even WiFi part of this device. I&#039;m thinking about turning it into kind of data acquisition station (RS485 and Flash/SD card over USB + SNMP for remote access).</p><p>Thanks</p><p>____________________________<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Miroslaw Lach (MiLek)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>milek</strong> on 25 Jul 2011, 22:16)</p>
