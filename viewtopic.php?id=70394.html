					<p>I recently bought a Belkin N300 router at a radioshack going out of business for like 10 bucks. I googled in the store and thought either tomato or openwrt was supported. It&#039;s not, so I figured what the hell if I brick it I&#039;m out $10 and I&#039;ll try to see if I can create some form of support for it. The goal is to make this a capable travel router or add it to the network as a repeater/slave to my main router.</p><p>Has anyone seen any information they could point me to about either this router in particular (the wikidev is pretty bare) or if there is anymore information about the Broadcom BCM5357C0? A cursory googling showed that there are routers that can run openwrt that use that SoC.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>
