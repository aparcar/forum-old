					<p>I am running Openwrt on a WL160NL router.</p><p>When the attached USB HDD is getting full, the transfer speed between the computer and router hdd drops to 200kb/s - mostly on the most recent files.<br />I figure that this is because of fragmentation - though transfer speed is 200kb or lower, hdd activity is very intense.</p><p>Is there a package I can use for defragmentation? How can I defrag the drive? (it is ext3 format)</p>									</div>

					<p>Do they? I am not sure then - my transfer speed drops dramatically when hdd approaches full space usage, and it is slower when transferring the last files that were copied. To me this is a sign of fragmentation...</p>									</div>

					<p>ext4&#039;s extents I think were made to help somewhat, but even that doesn&#039;t make it immune. Also, ReiserFS, btrfs and several other filesystems support block suballocation/tail packing that cuts down on fragmentation even more.</p>									</div>
