					<p>Hi</p><p>I&#039;m using openconnect on OpenWrt. It all works great, save for DNS resolution of names only on the VPN.</p><p>After a couple of hours of looking into what&#039;s happening, it seems this is the *defined* behaviour DNSMasq. I found this thread here <a href="http://lists.thekelleys.org.uk/pipermail/dnsmasq-discuss/2009q3/003295.html">http://lists.thekelleys.org.uk/pipermai â€¦ 03295.html</a></p><p>It points out two things:</p><p>1) That there&#039;s not really such a thing a nameserver priority<br />2) That even if you override this with the &#039;strict-order&#039; option, it&#039;ll stop at the first failure</p><p>It seems there is a concept of &#039;DNS splitting&#039;, which the VPN server can be configured to do. Essentially, I think that means the VPN server responds with a list of DNSs for *specific* domains. However, the VPN I connect to doesn&#039;t do this, and just sets up two new nameserver entries.</p><p>I naively assumed that the nameservers setup by the VPN connection would be tried first, but I&#039;ve found using the &#039;log-entries&#039; setting that they&#039;re just forwarded on upstream.</p><p>If I completely shutdown dnsmasq, I see that it&#039;s a good citizen and restores /etc/resolv.conf with the contents of /tmp/resolv.conf.auto, and all of a sudden resolution of VPN-private domains works.</p><p>It seems strange to me that dnsmasq argues its behaviour is correct, whereas when you stop it and use the default (presumably somewhere in the depths of the kernel/libc?), it works in a way that seems more intuitive.</p><p>Anyway, after all that, what&#039;s the best practice here, in the absence of DNS splitting, to get DNS to work both when VPN is up and down?</p>									</div>
