					<p>In my experience, troubleshooting iptables is best done at the command-line level. Shell into your router and run &quot;iptables -L -v&quot; to get a complete list of firewall rules in a format that makes auditing fairly easy. Rules are processed top-to-bottom. Be sure to check the default policy (should be DROP for scenario you&#039;re describing). And remember: INPUT filters packets for which the router is the final destination, OUTPUT filters packets for which the router is the source, and FORWARD filters packets that router is forwarding between interfaces. If your router is doing any actual routing between networks (which is very likely), the FORWARD rules will be your most important ones.</p><p>It is also useful to setup logging for all packets that don&#039;t match a specific file rule. You should be able to find tutorials using your favorite search engine.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well the actual mistake was using -A instead of -I when stuffing rules into builtin chains.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi and thank you both for your replies. It looks like I&#039;d really have to audit as Despot said. And btw, I did tried all options, including FORWARD, or flag -I instead of -A. So I&#039;d need to take a look at -L -v command.</p><p>Thank you again. Will post results when I find anything missing.</p><p>Regards.</p>									</div>
