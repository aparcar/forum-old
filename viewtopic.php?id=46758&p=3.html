					<p>I just received a R6300v2. </p><p>@tusc, thanks for the explanation. have you had any luck with the data persistence with the UBI images?</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>Zajec wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>One important thing left to do is sysupgrade. We should think about a way do upgrade firmware without loosing UBI wearing level.</p></blockquote></div><p>@zajec, just read a bit up on UBI, if I understand well it works in the following way:</p><p>raw flash -&gt; MTD -&gt; UBI -&gt; UBIFS</p><p>UBI layer does wear-leveling and bad-block management. If i understand well, wear-leveling means that it keeps all the erase blocks at the same erase level via the Erase Counter ( EC ) in the UBI header. If the wear level is aprox. the same for all erase blocks not sure why we need to keep it over the upgrades. I assume the flashing happens at the mtd level, so the UBI headers are getting overwritten and all will start from 0, which is good because we are again at an average level with all blocks, but we lost the old level. Do we really need that level? or we just want all the blocks to be at the same level.<br />I&#039;ve got another question in my mind, regarding bad-blocks. if the bad-blocks are know at UBI level, and flashing happens at MTD level, how will the flashing avoid the bad-blocks?</p><p>the UBI doc says ( <a href="http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/doc/ubi.html#L_ubi_headers">http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/doc/ … bi_headers</a> ) :<br />UBI stores 2 small 64-byte headers at the beginning of each non-bad physical eraseblock:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; erase counter header (or EC header) which contains the erase counter of the physical eraseblock (PEB) plus some other not so important information;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; volume identifier header (or VID header) which stores volume ID and logical eraseblock (LEB) number this PEB belongs to (plus some other not so important information).</p><p>maybe the fact that an UBI header is missing helps us identifying the bad-blocks.</p>									</div>

					<p>I dug a bit deeper. i guess one solution is to do the flashing at UBI level instead of mtd level as it&#039;s done currently, this way all the ubi data will be preserved. I understood ubi comes with a tool ubiupdatevol which flashes and image to an ubi volume :</p><p>ubiupdatevol -t /dev/ubi0_0&nbsp; - wipes a volume<br />ubiupdatevol /dev/ubi0_0 /path/to/ubifs.img - flashes ubifs.img to /dev/ubi0_0 ( which needs to be empty ).</p><p>some rework is required on the sysupgrade script.</p><p>got a question in mind about the kernel options.<br />I guess we flash only kernel and rootfs partitions, and don&#039;t touch the bootloader. <br />if I understood it well, the bootloader loads the kernel from a hardcoded address, but if we don&#039;t touch the bootloader, how can we pass options to the kernel? on X86 systems this is done through the bootloader.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Guys,</p><p>I&#039;ve just flashed the CC-RC3 on a R6300v2, and for some reason, on 2.4Ghz the range is like 2m, on channles 1-11. on channels 12-13 it works as it should, but unfortunately, not all the devices see the channels above 11.<br />What could I do to have channles 1-11 working properly? with the original fw, it was working properly.</p>									</div>

					<p>It didn&#039;t work for me, I tried CC, it doesn&#039;t see 5GHz radio at all, and 2.4GHz range after 1 cold reboot is like 2m. so useless if you need wifi. I tried Kong&#039;s dd-wrt and both radios work very well with his drivers. I&#039;d like to build an image with the wl drivers taken from the dd-wrt sources, but not sure how to do it. If someone could give some directions, would be highly appreciated, so we could benefit of the great hardware inside this router and great fw ( openwrt ).</p>									</div>
