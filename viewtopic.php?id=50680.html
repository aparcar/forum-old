					<p>Thought I had read all the steps and cautions, but must have missed something and now I&#039;m stuck.</p><p>I decided it was time I built a replacement for my ASUS WL-500G Premium V1 that is still running a _very_ old version of OpenWrt.&nbsp; Happily, that system is still working fine.</p><p>This is a first time flash of OpenWrt onto a Linksys E3000 with OEM firmware.&nbsp; I followed the OpenWrt support page for the E3000 (just updated in the last day) and downloaded the latest Barrier Breaker (trunk) image (openwrt-e3000_v1-squashfs.bin).&nbsp; I tried installing it using the stock web interface as instructed.&nbsp; When it got to about 80% complete, it suddenly jumped to complete.&nbsp; I left it untouched for five minutes (well actually it was closer to ten while I went and got some tea ;-).</p><p>When I restarted and tried to get to the web interface on 192.168.1.1, it failed to connect, but I _was_ getting an IP assigned by DHCP to the new IP range.&nbsp; After at least ten more minutes fiddling with various external tests like pinging the router, I tried things like gifing it a hard reset (30/30/30), but no luck.</p><p>Then I went back and worked on doing the update by TFTP using the linksys TFTP tool and finally got what appeared to be a successful transfer -- progress bar took about 10 seconds, if that, to complete.&nbsp; I left it untouched for at least five minutes again before doing a hard reset and watched ping results until I got about ten successes.&nbsp; When I tried getting to the web page, it still failed.&nbsp; Again, I am getting an IP assigned by DHCP successfully (I tried a hardcoded IP of 192.168.1.10, too, but no help there.)&nbsp; Simple power cycling of the router and additional hard resets didn&#039;t change anything, either.&nbsp; It seems like the lights are on but nobody will answer the door.&nbsp; After it has had time to boot up, the power light is steady and the lan port light will go on/off as I connect/disconnect my pc, but that&#039;s about it.</p><p>What did I do wrong/what do I do now to fix this?</p>									</div>
