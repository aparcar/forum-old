					<p>I have had OpenWRT installed on one of my routers for a year now, while I was living with my grandparents I had Comcast, and a wireless gateway and I used my OpenWRT as a wifi client mode and had another Netgear router hooked up to it to send out wireless signal and connected everything to that router while my Netgear router connected to the OpenWRT router which was then in client mode connected to the main wireless gateway downstairs speeds were fine over there. Now I have moved to my parents and they have AT&amp;T with a wireless gateway I have the same exact setup, however, I am barely getting 1mb/s could anyone please tell me what I can do to remedy this. Help is very much appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well one difference for sure is going to be placement and interference, your signal might just be crap where you are.</p>									</div>
