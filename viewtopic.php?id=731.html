Your firmware is fine, besides, it&#039;s not even getting to the point that it&#039;s trying to load the firmware.</p><p>It&#039;s in the bootloader trying to initialize the hardware and having a hard time finding those 32M you said it had, probably crashing pretty bad trying. The change was made in nvram and in the overall picture you only have to ways out - do something about nvram, or add more memory. The &quot;sure thing&quot; way of fixing it is as suggested earlier, build a jtag programmer and talk to the flash chip directly, fixing the erroneous values. The cheaper, somewhat riskier way is playing with the flash chip again, this time attempting to corrupt nvram --- if the device boots up and doesn&#039;t find the faulty nvram values it will actually boot, actually if it doesn&#039;t find nvram atall it will recreate the nvram partition for you, filling it with defaults for your router.</p><p>As documented on the wiki (read for more info), for a v1.0 device it&#039;s pins 2-3 to force an nvram reset, although the timing is critical. The pinouts being similar, I would suspect the same trick works on the v2, although honestly I&#039;ve never tried.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks a lot for this tip, I just get i working on a WRT54G v2.2. FR (revision XH)</p><p>Here are now the sdram settings :</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>sdram_config=0x0032
sdram_refresh=0x0000
sdram_ncdl=0x20622
sdram_init=0x0008</code></pre></div><p>But the question is, why put 32MB physical ram, and just use 16 MB of it by default ? I think it is done to reduce production costs and prepare transition between models, but it is still quite strange <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile"/></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>RItalMan</strong> on 29 May 2005, 07:08)</p>

					<p>Also, not all 2.0 XH models have 32 megs of ram:</p><p><a href="http://linksysinfo.org/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=2556&amp;start=20">http://linksysinfo.org/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=2556&amp;start=20</a></p><p>I posted that last post.&nbsp; I have a 2.0 XH board with 16 megs of ram.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t even try the procedure.</p>									</div>

					<p>Some people on the irc channel pointed out that you cannot read that post without logging in... so here&#039;s what I said:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Yup, folks should listen to you. I have a version 2.0 of the WRT54G. I opened up the case, and I had a 2.0 XH version!</p><p>BUT ... looking at the chips mine said 400, not 800. So I definitely have only 16 megs of ram and not 32.</p><p>I didn&#039;t even attempt to do the procedure. I just wanted to share with everyone that only certain 2.0 XH&#039;s have the larger chips, mine does not, and Toxic is absolutely right... if you risk doing the upgrade, you better be 100% completely and totally sure you can. If you ruin your router, you have noone to blame but yourself.</p><p>I got a little excited and anxious when I saw the 2.0 XH on the board, but when I noticed my chips were only 400&#039;s ... kinda let down. But it beats the heck outta bricking my router.</p></blockquote></div><p>A little out of context, but basically, you need to open up your unit and make sure your chips say IC42S16800-7T and not IC42S16400-7T, as mine do.&nbsp; I only have 16 megs of ram on my 2.0 XH unit, and if I do this procedure, I will brick my router...</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah. Great. Bricked my XH unit. Saw this thread to late. Fixed the Wiki HW Table. Thought all XH would have 32MB ...</p><p>Strange thing is the following:<br/>Initializing Arena.<br/>Initializing Devices.<br/>et0: Broadcom BCM47xx 10/100 Mbps Ethernet Controller 3.50.21.0<br/>CPU type 0x29007: 200MHz<br/>Total memory: 0x2000000 bytes (32MB)</p><p>Taken from the serial console.
