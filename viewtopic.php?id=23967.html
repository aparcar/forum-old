					<p>When it comes to a Linux embedded system, I would be looking for a device that has plenty of Flash/RAM with at least a USB2 port. Since you want to do a VPN, you should look for a router that has a built-in a hardware encryption chip. AFAIK, only a handful WiFi router supported by OpenWRT has a built-in hardware encryption chip and among them is a long discontinue Netgear <a href="http://kb.netgear.com/app/products/model/a_id/2598">WGT634U</a> and it has all the features I mentioned here.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m currently testing Netgear WNDR3700 (680MHz 64MB RAM/8 Flash) and Buffalo WZR-HP-300NG (400MHz 64MB RAM/32 Flash), both with gigabit switches. Both devices seem much more capable than WRT54GL family. Buffalo is somewhat cheaper, has more flash but slightly slower performance. Netgear is probably better suited for high bandwidth scenarios. I&#039;ll probably use either, depending on the situation requirements...</p>									</div>
