					<p>Maybe, nas (WPA and 802.1x authenticator) is crashing and you cannot then connect to your AP. You can put a cron script that restarts nas after 1 day for instance.</p>									</div>

					<p>1) check radio connection quality (wl scan ; sleep 1 ; wl scanresults) for ample signal to noise ratio.<br />2) no need to reboot; quicker would be a script with<br />killall nas<br />wifi<br />/etc/init.d/S41wpa</p><p>Of course this is fighting the symptom, not curing the cause. I do find in practice that problems in reconnecting are not due to nas but to interference on the channel; the key challenge is a long packet that needs to arrive intact which may take a long time in noisy conditions.<br />Would this be the cause you can see it by on either side using &#039;wl sta_info &lt;MAC of other side&gt;&#039;<br />that should show &#039;associated, authenticated, authorized&#039;; the last a... will lack.</p><p>Just to eliminate possible causes, besides nas as a cause.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>doddel</strong> on 14 Nov 2006, 11:15)</p>

					<p>I just took a look and found that when I can not connect to the AP, nas is not running <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> simply quits... I have now used cron to restart nas every morning 7am. I am not that much of a scriptmaster, but i guess the best way would be to schedule a script (let&#039;s say every 30seconds) that would check if nas is in the output of ps and if not, it launches S41wpa... I will look into this now...</p><p>If this is a well-known bug, I hope it&#039;ll be soon resolved... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/yikes.png" width="15" height="15" alt="yikes" /></p><p>doddel: i&#039;ll try to do some testing on channels and quality, but I&#039;d rather say the reason is not in SNR... I am sitting about 10 feet away from the AP, direct sight. When I deployed the AP, I made a site survey to check neigbours&#039; wifi, and tried to find a spot which is not interfering. Also increasing Tx power did not really have any influence on the sympthoms. Thanks anyway!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi there,</p><p>I am still experiencing nas issues. I am suspecting they are coming from the nas process hanging/stopping at certain times.

					<p>Given that nas is a binary from Broadcom and WPA doesn&#039;t even get implemented by most router manufactures, a true fix could be a long time coming.&nbsp; &nbsp;Considering nas and the wifi driver is the reason were still stuck on the 2.4 kernel, I don&#039;t see them making changes too quick. </p><p>I have dealt with this problem in production by running a simple script that pings the connected hosts once every 10 seconds and if it misses 3 pings it resets nas.&nbsp; The script waits another 10 minutes before starting checks again in case the other router is simply out of service.&nbsp; &nbsp;This has worked quite well and no one seems to notice the link ever went down.&nbsp; &nbsp;I usually see the link reset about once every 2 to 10 days.</p>									</div>

					<p>That&#039;s quite interesting... I see that killing the nas process breaks the wireless connections, and every host needs to reconnect... Are you actually pinging the connected clients through the wireless interface? How do you get a list of connected clients?</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, they are pinged through the wireless interface.&nbsp; In my configuration every wds connection is a routed connection with static IP addresses.&nbsp; I simply ping the all other router&#039;s IP addresses.&nbsp; </p><p>If your using bridged wds, you should still set each router to have a lan IP address.&nbsp; That could be pinged as well.&nbsp; </p><p>Re-connections happen in just a few seconds from resetting nas.&nbsp; For people browsing the web they never seem to notice.&nbsp; If however you are using VoIP or other real time protocols the failure and reset of nas will certainly be noticed.&nbsp; Every couple weeks I&#039;ve been making my scripts a little more aggressive in checking links, but I&#039;m concerned about getting any more aggressive than the time it takes a router to reboot, other wise rebooting one router could have a cascade effect on resets.&nbsp; </p><p>I intend to add VoIP on my network as soon as this problem is resolved.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ehm, ok, I understand...</p><p>My clients directly connect to the AP (so no WDS). And I noticed that restarting the nas process breaks the connection in xp and reconnection takes a while.
