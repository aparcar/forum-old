					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve written a small utility called slide-switch that translates slide switch position changes into normal button presses.</p><p>For devices with a (3-position) slide switch, for example the TP-Link TL-MR3020, the switch is usually represented as two push buttons. So a change to the switch position triggers either one or two button events, and finding the current position requires reading from two GPIOs.</p><p>Others have shared script snippets on this forum to handle this for specific devices, but I thought it was time to create a package that anyone can install and start using their slide switch without having to re-script the wheel.</p><p>I&#039;ve combed the wiki for devices with a slide switch and have incorporated their details, but since I only have a TL-MR3020, I&#039;m unable to verify that the package works correctly on those other devices. (I may also be missing devices that have a slide switch but aren&#039;t described in the wiki.)</p><p>Before submitting to the official package feed, I&#039;d like to make sure the data is correct. So if you have a device with a slide switch, I&#039;d really appreciate it if you can install the package and let me know if it works for you, either on this thread or on GitHub.</p><p>Supported devices: github.com/jefferyto/openwrt-slide-switch#supported-devices<br />Packages for CC 15.05.1: github.com/jefferyto/openwrt-slide-switch/releases/tag/0.9.0<br />(Not sure if these will install correctly on trunk; let me know if they don&#039;t.)</p><p>Thanks in advance!<br />Jeff</p>									</div>
