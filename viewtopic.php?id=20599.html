					<p>Today I played a little bit around with my Linksys WRT54GL and openWRT... I tried to revert the openWRT firmware back to the original linksys firmware with mtd (<a href="http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs(2f)Deinstalling.html">http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs( … lling.html</a>).<br />Unfortunately I didn&#039;t read to the end, where is explained to cut off the header of the bin file to get a trx.<br />Instead of this I followed the message of mtd and added the -f (force) switch to the command.</p><p>Now everything seems to be damaged :-(</p><p>I didn&#039;t succeed with the tftp method to flash another firmware.</p><p>Is there a way to get the router back to life again?</p>									</div>

					<p>Quickest is undoubtedly a $5 Nokia DKU-5 cable for serial console.</p><p>Timing TFTP during the boot_wait is the key problem, which is easy with serial and pure guesswork otherwise.&nbsp; With a serial console you can abort the boot and type a few commands to initiate the TFTP from the WRT side which makes it incredibly easy.&nbsp; Nearly every WRT that passes through my hands now I solder on some kind of console connector, it is a very useful thing to learn.</p><p>However you should be able to succeed with &quot;blind&quot; TFTP with enough trials.&nbsp; If you had set boot_wait the window is longer, if you did not you will probably take many more attempts to succeed.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Key thing is use an intervening hub/switch so the PC you are attempting to send from has &quot;link up&quot; state at all times. If you depend on &quot;link up&quot; from WRT LAN ports directly, then by the time desktop OS sees it and activates it&#039;s usually already too late to send TFTP.&nbsp; Play around with the exact timing of when you send it you will get it eventually I think it took me 20+ tries once on a WRT that did not have boot_wait set.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 6 Jun 2009, 23:06)</p>

					<p>Yes I have boot_wait set to 10 seconds. Should it be possible to send the new image via tftp all over this time or is it still necessary to find the appropriate moment?<br />I&#039;ll also try your hint to put a switch between PC and WRT.<br />Should &quot;windows-way&quot; as described in the openWRT documentation work or should I get me a knoppix or so and try with linux tools?</p><p>Unless I&#039;m totally bored, I won&#039;t start soldering on the device ;-)</p>									</div>

					<p>I agree with vincentfox.&nbsp; Try several times to TFTP the firmware until it sticks.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have access to any WRT54GLs anymore, but I have had to do this to a couple of them.&nbsp; One even appeared to be non-functional out of the box until I flashed White Russian onto it.</p><p>I can&#039;t comment on whether it will work from Windows, because I used Linux.&nbsp; I also had a switch between my machine and the router.&nbsp; Neither of the routers had boot_wait set.</p><p>As long as the boot loader hasn&#039;t been overwritten it should be fine.&nbsp; You just have to catch it at the right time, so you&#039;ll probably have to reboot many times and try hitting ENTER on your tftp command at different times after powering the router on until it works.&nbsp; There&#039;s also documentation on what the lights do while booting up on the wiki somewhere that should help you know when to issue the command.&nbsp; I can&#039;t remember off hand what the lights do, and as I said I don&#039;t have access to any WRT54GLs anymore.</p><p>Just whatever you do DON&#039;T try shorting pins.</p>									</div>

					<p>The boot_wait variable is either on or off.&nbsp; There is no &quot;seconds&quot; setting for it.&nbsp; I think there is another variable &quot;wait_time&quot; did you set that to 10 seconds?</p><p>It&#039;s a particular point during the startup process so yes it&#039;s a &quot;window&quot; you have to hit.&nbsp; First the system powers up and does a quick POST then at a particular point it hits this &quot;boot_wait&quot; and accepts a TFTP image, if it doesn&#039;t see the image starting during the X second window in which it is open to it, then it proceeds booting and you have to try again. If you have started your TFTP too early oops.&nbsp; The window is not immediately on plugin it&#039;s a few seconds after not sure when.</p><p>If you have a serial console it&#039;s obvious because it prints a message about it&#039;s waiting.</p><p>I have done this with Windows I don&#039;t think it matters.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 7 Jun 2009, 01:32)</p>
