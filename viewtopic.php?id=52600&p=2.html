					<p>Thank you very, very much for your support so far. I am really grateful!</p><p>Some questions:</p><p>Q1: Mailsend. smtp.eastlink.ca. For gmail, would that be smtp.gmail.com?<br />Q2: Wouldn&#039;t a password be needed for matching from_me@somewhere.com (in my gmail case; myname@gmail.com)?<br />Q3: Can I add something as &quot;subject&quot; in the email?<br />Q4: WiFi setup: I guess I can use WPA2 instead of PSK?<br />Q5: WiFi setup: Can I connect to a DHCP server so I don&#039;t need fixed IP-address for the WiFi?<br />Q6: Line: Config interface &#039;lan&#039;. Can I just skip this if am I connected to PC via serial connector on the GL.inet?<br />Q7: Line: Config interface &#039;wan&#039;. Same question as above.<br />Q8: I would prefer to load only the configuration info with the USB-stick (as config.txt).<br />Would you know how to replace:<br />&nbsp; a) WiFi settings<br />&nbsp; b) Email info like: from_me@somewhere.com, to_someone@somewhere.com, subject, and &quot;Message Number X&quot;?</p>									</div>
