					<p>I got a WRT1900ac on Black Friday. Since then I&#039;ve had three separate occasions where the router just dies. It will not broadcast at all and the ethernet does not work. I don&#039;t recall exactly but the LEDs were not all on either. I have to turn it off for a minute or two before it will work. If I don&#039;t leave it off long enough it won&#039;t go through it&#039;s entire LED cycle and usually just the power and internet (I think) LEDs come on and stay on, no flashing. I&#039;ve read the fan only comes on when needed but I have never heard the fan running. Not sure if that is a factor or not. Of course I keep it well ventilated and nothing is on top of it. I haven&#039;t done any modding or messed with the firmware at all. It is on the latest stock firmware though.</p><p>My question is has anyone else had these issues with the stock firmware? I wanted to install the most stable custom firmware but wanted to get familiarized with the router first and then this issue started showing up. I&#039;ve heard a lot of bad things about the stock firmware and I&#039;m wondering if it a firmware issue or hardware. So I am wondering if the problem will go away once I flash it. I know I can just flash it and see what happens but I wanted to get some feedback first and am hesitant on flashing it if the hardware is unstable.</p>									</div>
