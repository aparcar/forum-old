					<p>Hi all, new to the forum, lede, openwrt and everything so I hope you will bear with me.<br />I am trying to load an initial sysupgrade file onto my hh5a, I get right to the point of flashing the file off a USB, but it fails with a message &quot;invalid sysupgrade file&quot; &quot;image check &#039;platform_check_image&#039; failed &quot;<br />This has not been a smooth process, so there is a chance of corruption etc. Plus I have run the prepare script before losing my serial link and having to start again, so this may be related.<br />Any advice gratefully received.<br />Bob</p><p>** This was caused due to the USB not being seen by the hub - Changed drive, Formatted exfat, sorted.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bobbo</strong> on 26 Feb 2018, 13:19)</p>
