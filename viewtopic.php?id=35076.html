					<p>I&#039;m using openwrt (backfire branch) on some custom hardware and having some issues with getting kernel modules built and loaded at runtime.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want them built and loaded as packages but as normal kernel modules.&nbsp; So is the proper method to (1) use make menuconfig, then go enable desired modules under &#039;Kernel modules&#039; or (2) use make kernel_menuconfig and enable desired modules within the kernel config environment?&nbsp; Which method takes priority over the other?&nbsp; Which method results in the kernel modules being loaded automatically (by /etc/init.d/boot loading whatever is defined in /etc/modules.d/*) at system startup?&nbsp; </p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
