					<p>Hi, i currently have my OpenWrt connecting to my micro$oft server as a ppp client. All works perfectly.</p><p>However, I would like to use LT2P rather than using PPTP.</p><p>What packages do i need to install to get a working LT2P client on OpenWrt? With the linux server side, i wish to use OpenSwan so the client will need to connect with this. I&#039;m sure this is possible but dont know which packages to use.</p><p>From the tutorials wiki i can only see servers on OpenWrt, ideally i would like a tutorial on connecting OpenWrt as a client to the OpenSwan server.<br />Thanks in advance,</p><p>Chris</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>g18c</strong> on 5 Jul 2007, 16:35)</p>
