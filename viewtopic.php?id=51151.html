					<p>Here is my network topology:</p><p>Internet -&gt; ISP Router (no DHCP) -&gt; Switch -&gt; OpenWRT (DHCP, wifi AP)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&gt; PCs<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&gt; Wifi devices</p><p>I have to use the ISP router, but have delegated most of the useful work (DHCP, DNS, DDNS, Wifi access) off of it to the OpenWRT device. As it&#039;s not doing any routing, we can delete the WAN network (I haven&#039;t yet, but I think I will). the ISP router and all devices are currently on 10.10.0.0/16. </p><p>How can I enable guest wifi access here? Say with 10.12.0.0/16? I tried following the instructions at:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan-webinterface">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/gue â€¦ binterface</a><br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=34092">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=34092</a><br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=28317">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=28317</a></p><p>But the solutions there all appear to presume the OpenWRT is routing to a WAN. My questions:</p><p>1) How can I enable guest wifi access that only allows internet access via the ISP router?</p><p>2) As this is a also learning exercise for me, can someone please explain the difference between a forwarding zone, a static route and a firewall rule?</p><p>3) If I was to add another OpenWrt AP to the switch to extend the range of the Wifi, how would I leverage guest access on that? It&#039;s simple enough to extend wifi (same SSID, security, turn off DHCP), but I&#039;m not sure how to do it for guest access short of creating a new subnet say 10.13.0.0/16. Can it use the guest DHCP setup from the first router? Guests probably don&#039;t need to access each other so it&#039;s not a big deal, but for my knowledge I&#039;d like to know how that would be possible.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>spammy</strong> on 17 Jun 2014, 19:22)</p>

					<p>Thank you for the reply. I have to say I find that surprising though. For example, I&#039;m currently running a VPN server inside a virtual machine that allocates addresses from a third subnet and through that clients are able to access the internet via my ISP, and I considered this to be a simpler use case than that.</p><p>My networking is limited, but wouldn&#039;t it be a case of setting up a static route from the guest network to the LAN one?

Whether this happens in hardware only like in hardware switches or in software on a router like in OpenWrt is unrelated to the principle.</p><p>Or, to put it in simple terms: Yes, OpenWrt is running on your router, but it is sitting on the sidelines doing its own stuff as a separate machine while the networking stuff is happening separately from its routing capabilities.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 18 Jun 2014, 23:39)</p>

Ethernet operates on Layer 2. Without routing, Openwrt also operates on layer 2.</p><p>In order to create a &quot;guest&quot; network on this basis you would need a layer-2 method of preventing users on the wireless from accessing other devices at layer-2 on your LAN. The only way to do this over a LAN cable, is to use VLANs which requires support at the other end of the cable.*</p><p>*Theoretically ebtables, and other MAC based filtering could work but would be un-necessarily complex and difficult for this purpose.</p><p>IP operates on layer 3. With routing on, you can have Openwrt block direct layer-2 access to your LAN and only allow traffic through on the IP level, at which point you can use layer-3 rules to block access to your LAN - as your lan fits neatly into a single layer-3 definition (i.e. a subnet) it would be easier. But you would have to use iptables for this, and hence physically separate the wlan from the lan at layer 2.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you really must the basic overview is, assuming a stock, standard Openwrt install</p><p>1) Disable the WAN interface<br />2) Add a non-bridged wireless guest AP<br />3) Add firewall rules to allow routing from that network<br />4) Add firewall rules to block routing from that network to your LAN<br />5) Reconfigure DHCP to the guest network only.</p><p>Editing config files is not a hack, it&#039;s standard and normal procedure for Openwrt. The development version doesn&#039;t even come with any other way to configure it except config files. But you could do all that through the GUI.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>qasdfdsaq</strong> on 25 Jun 2014, 20:22)</p>
