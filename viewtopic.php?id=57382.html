					<p>I need some advice of a usb wifi dongle that works with openwrt on raspberry pi 2, my current router limits the internet speed from my provider so I figured I should buy a raspi 2 and a usb wifi and then install openwrt on it but I&#039;m afraid if my usb wifi isn&#039;t detected on raspi 2, please suggest me some usb wifi dongles that work with it. Please choose the cheap ones if there&#039;s any <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>PS: Please don&#039;t ask why I want to buy a raspi and install openwrt on it, I have my reason. Just tell me what usb wifi I should go for. Thank you.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hillz</strong> on 16 May 2015, 16:24)</p>
