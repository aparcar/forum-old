					<p>As the title says, I have a bricked TL-WR1043ND for sale.</p><p>I have used this for about 6 months and it worked great. Recently I signed up with a new internet provider that gave a wireless modem, so I didn&#039;t need to rely on the WR anymore, so I started playing.</p><p>I managed to install gargoyle and then tried to set it up as a bridge. After saving the settings I could no longer log in, so I tried to hard-reset it. Now the sys light comes on and stays on. I tried to hold the button in and telnet to it... but I couldn&#039;t figure out how to do it. It might still be possible to soft-unbrick, but I have no experience with this.</p><p>I will take the best offer for it plus shipping. It will be coming from Canada, so you can check <a href="http://www.canadapost.ca">www.canadapost.ca</a> for a shipping estimate (use L4W 1J6 as a origin postal code and guestimate the package size).&nbsp; If you are in the GTA I could probably drop it off for free.</p>									</div>
