					<p>Hello david,<br />Successfully managed to upgrade the Router with your snapshot - I did notice they had been updated recently so I do have the last version. However, I am stuck trying to upgrade using the .bin file via Putty. I can login via putty and get to the tmp folder yet clueless on how I get the file itself from my PC to the router?<br />Can you please give me some guidance as I am new to all this?<br />Regards,</p><p>Update:<br />Managed, by chance, to ascertain how to download (wget command) and got the .bin file to the /tmp folder. Then I used your example &quot;sysupgrade /tmp/imageName.bin&quot; and noticed the following within putty shell: Saving config file... then killall: watchdog: no processes killed. commencing upgrade. All sheel sessions will now be closed. At this point I was kicked out. I left the router for a few minutes and logged back in.&nbsp; </p><p>How can I tell if the upgrade was successful as I cannot see anything within the system log file?<br />Firmware version is: Lede SNAPSHOT r5917-36f1978a70 / LuCI Master (git-18.020.50283-194e429)<br />Kernel version is: 4.9.77<br />I did not make any notes to the above two rows to have a before and after comparison, so I am in the dark at the moment. <br />Regards,</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Morrile</strong> on 11 Feb 2018, 14:08)</p>

I have managed to copy the upgrade over using the above app :-) and now going to use putty to upgrade again, as the logs don&#039;t note any updates. Also, I noticed a few anomalies with wi-fi not working, and so, trying again in the hope it works this time.</p>									</div>

I will comment on my experience with Stubby and GetDns later on in this post.<br />First. I did find two articles on getting DNS TLS working using Unbound.&nbsp; Look at &quot;What is DNS Privacy and how to set it up for OpenWRT&quot; -&nbsp; https - blog.grobox.de/2018/what-is-dns-privacy-and-how-to-set-it-up-for-openwrt/ - the article is self explanatory. There is also a series of posts on the Lede Forum - https - forum.lede-project.org/t/quad9-dns-encryption/9420/9. Again - both of these use unbound - you can see the information from - https - calomel.org/unbound_dns.html&nbsp; - Unbound DNS Tutorial scroll down to &quot; DNS Over TLS, simple recursive caching DNS, TCP port 853 ENCRYPTED &quot;</strong></p><p><strong>As for GetDns and Stubby - I found GetDns in feed - it is -&nbsp; src/gz reboot_package - https - downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/packages/arm_cortex-a9_vfpv3/packages/&nbsp; - you must add this to your custom feeds. Then both stubby and getdns can be installed. The yaml config file comes from your repo Dave - but Stubby comes from OpenWrt . I do not know if this causes a problem. <br />The author of &quot;What is DNS Privacy and how to set it up for OpenWRT&quot; which I alluded to earlier states &quot; <em> If you just have one local desktop or laptop computer, you can use Stubby a local DNS Privacy stub resolver. The solution I recommend is to set up DNS Privacy directly on your router, so all devices entering the internet via this router (and using it for DNS queries) will benefit from it</em>.&quot; Now I am not sure exactly what this means. <br />Maybe - he was unaware that Stubby is now available on Lede / OpenWrt as it has only been available recently.<br />By the way - all of this is brought to us by &quot; The DNS Privacy Project &quot;&nbsp; - https -&nbsp; dnsprivacy.org/wiki/display/DP/DNS+Privacy+Project+Homepage. So, there you have it. Any and all feedback information and elucidation will be greatly appreciated by all - especially regarding Stubby and GetDns on Lede / OpenWrt..<br />Dave you are simply the best and -</strong></p><p><strong>God Bless You and Yours In Peace,</strong></p><p><strong>Directnupe</strong></p></blockquote></div><p>They both appear available on the latest sources, so I&#039;ll tick those boxes &quot;M&quot; to be compiled on the next build. Providing they build correctly, they will be a part of the repository.</p><p>*EDIT*</p><p>Two options with getdns. Currently 1 is checked. </p><p>1 GETDNS_ENABLE_STUB_ONLY<br />2 GETDNS_ENABLE_ION</p></blockquote></div><p>Dear Dave,<br />You must forgive me - for I am nothing if not consistent and persistent. I sent a message to &quot; cliobrando &quot; over in the Lede / OpenWrt Forum. As you know he compiles and/ or develops a &quot; [GCC 7.2 BUILD] Optimized TP-Link Archer C7 V2 AC1750 LEDE &quot; build.<br />This is the post / message I sent him below:</p><p><strong><em>Dear cliobrando -<br />Hello and I hope that you are well. I am trying to get Stubby and GetDns running on Lede / OpenWrt. I use Davidc502 LEDE Snapshots - which is a Community Build for Linksys WRT series routers - specifically for 3200ACM 1200AC 1900AC 1900ACS.<br />**So I am asking that you do two favors by way of continuing your mission of advancing Lede / OpenWrt development. **<br />First - if it would not be too much of an imposition, I would ask you to contact Davidc502 and share with him how to compile and implement Stubby and GetDns in his builds. I am assuming you understand this process very well as you stated &quot; Removed DNSCrypt and replaced it with Unbound + odhcp to use DNS over TLS but unbound isn’t optimized so I just disabled the SSL Forward and use unbound as a caching dns forwarder, now that Stubby + getdns is in the LEDE trunk I will replace unbound with Stubby (which works perfect with DNS over TLS). &quot;. Many folks use Dave’s builds and you would be doing us all a great service. You can contact Dave as he states on his homepage &quot; Questions? Inquiries? Contact me ( Dave ) over here <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=64949i.">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=64949i.</a><br />**Second - if again not too much too ask - if you would be kind enough to convey to me exactly how to setup and configure Stubby and GetDns I would truly be grateful. I am a retired English Teacher and have a How To posted in the user guide for Lede Torguard Vpn. I would like to do the same for Stubby and Getdns. You know write a step by step instruction guide so the average Jane / Joe will be able to easily understand DNS over TLS using Stubby and GetDns which worked perfectly together in your estimation. **<br />Thanks for all you do in leading the way in Lede / Openwrt development. Hope to hear from you soon as I am anxious to be as secure as possible on the world wide web.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Peace and God Bless,</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>DirectNupe</em></strong></p><p>So - Dave I hope you do not mind my reaching out to him on our behalf here at Davidc502 LEDE Snapshots. Hopefully, this will move forward ( DNS over TLS )&nbsp; as this is a giant step forward in web security. By the way if you care to reach out to &quot; cliobrando &quot; directly - you can do so at -&nbsp; <a href="https://forum.lede-project.org/u/cliobrando.">https://forum.lede-project.org/u/cliobrando.</a><br />Dave I hope that this helps us all working together can get it done.</p><p>Yours In Peace and Grace,</p><p>Directnupe</p>									</div>

Contact me over here <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=64949i">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=64949i</a> - which will redirect you to - RIGHT HERE !<br />Maybe you should go back through this forum in order to see some of the type and nature of conversations which take place here. But yes - you are in the right place. By the way, Dave said that he was to put out a new build this past weekend. Dave compiles new builds from the Lede /OpenWrt&nbsp; trunk&nbsp; - so he always tries to be up to date. I and others are awaiting his new build - I hope that he has included GETDNS and Stubby ( DNS over TLS ).<br />As an example - I will post how to get that up and running here as soon as he releases those in his repo. As those - GETDNS and Stubby are not in the Lede Snapshot repo for our devices. But as I suggested - go back and read prior posts and responses in order to get a feel for this Community.</p><p>Peace,</p><p>Directnupe</p></blockquote></div></blockquote></div><p>By the way, Lede SnapShots do not even come with Luci ( web interface ). Dave Builds come with many pre-installed software packages saving you time , pain and effort. So - this is the way to go. Like with wifi drivers - you do not get support from Lede per se - at least not like in this Community. The stable Lede will leave you stuck with old WiFi drivers. I hope you understand are convinced as it is a no brainer to me and many others. Go with&nbsp; &nbsp;Davidc502 LEDE Snapshots.</p><p>Peace,</p><p>Directnupe</p>									</div>

					<p>@Directnupe<br />I have been over to Dave&#039;s site. Will download 3200ACM latest fw and test new WiFi driver, feeding back results over here. There certainly a lot of effrot going into the fw and a good rich set of feedback on this thread. I shall do this tonight. Thank you for your kind help.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ninjaef</strong> on 12 Feb 2018, 17:13)</p>
