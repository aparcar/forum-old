					<p>preferably both routers should be same brand and Chipset and firwware, if you have made changes, I advise to System/back up flash firmware/reset to defaults/perform reset<br />This are the steps, once first router is set with WDS enabled, set second router on same subnet dif ip, out of DHCP server from main router, then go to Network/interfaces/Lan, Protocol by default is set to Static, at the bottom ignore interface, tick disable dhcp for this interface, before you save settings, as you disable dhcp, set static ip in your Lap and check you did it right, now save &amp; apply<br />Now go to Network/wifi/Scan after seconds a new window with all networks at your reach, join the one from your main router, in the new window write password from router to join, below in create and assign firewall zone, select Lan the green one, at the bottom right submit, in the new window in mode select Client WDS, and Lan, save, you are in General Tab,&nbsp; click on right Adavanced settings, check HT mode is same as main router, wireless security is set just check, click the two green arrows to view password, Save &amp; Apply<br />Don&#039;t forget you have static ip in your Lap reset to dinamyc and now you are able to surf Internet, now add the AP go to Network/wifi/Add set SSID any you wish, in Mode Access Point WDS in Network Lan, set security, Save &amp; Apply,&nbsp; end. <br />In case I made a mistake you can set Routed Client mode, read my post it&#039;s last one here <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=61025">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=61025</a><br />I got the info from here, <a href="http://foro.seguridadwireless.net/openwrt/(tutorial)-modo-clienterepetidor-openwrt/">http://foro.seguridadwireless.net/openw â€¦ r-openwrt/</a><br />You need Chrome to translate <br />Besides my Tuto there is another one you need Relayd package with that both routers could. be dif.
