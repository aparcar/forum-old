					<p>I have two routers and they&#039;re both in a solid (correct) WDS mode. I want to turn one of them (the one with DNSMASQ and FIREWALL disabled already) to be in WET mode in place of an AP because I don&#039;t need it to be an AP and I want better speeds from my network. How would I be able to do this. In the nvram setup instructions it says all you have to do is set wl0_mode=&quot;wet&quot; but that does nothing.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I hear that if you have a WDS bridge it would slow the connection by half, presumably due to the two routers having to keep open for clients and between each other. If it&#039;s in WET it won&#039;t be receiving clients and connecting to the main AP, right? </p><p>Anyways thanks, I&#039;ll try that, do I have to undo any nvrams to make wl work? Such as my WDS link?</p>									</div>

					<p>You schematics are accurate, except that AP1 is still connectable through wireless, AP1 and AP2 are not far from each other so it&#039;s no loss really, I&#039;ve seen interlan slowdown from 3000kb/sec to 1500kb/sec, so that&#039;s pretty significant. </p><p>so wl doesn&#039;t stay after a reboot?</p>									</div>

I&#039;ll have a look at it, it&#039;s crazy :x</p><p>In fact, the advantage of using wireless is to use no wire but you want it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><br /><br /><p>I use access point in client mode to connect to other Wireless Network like this:</p><br /><p>Internet &lt;===&gt; [UnknowN AP] &lt;&lt;&lt; Wireless &gt;&gt;&gt; [AP1 in client mode]-------Wire-------[AP2] &lt;&lt;&lt; Wireless &gt;&gt;&gt; [Laptop]</p><p>In this case, it&#039;s usefull, if your laptop cant get the signal because the other access point [Unknown AP] is too far, your AP with openwrt can easily get it. <br />U put your access point [AP1] on the Unknown network as a client and u can get internet on it and then retransmit it to another access point [AP2] for ur use <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p>									</div>
