					<p>Hi,<br />I have successfully configured privateinternetaccess VPN service on OpenWRT using this guide: <a href="https://github.com/andrewbrereton/privateinternetaccess-on-openwrt">https://github.com/andrewbrereton/priva â€¦ on-openwrt</a></p><p>However enabling VPN causes that my router&#039;s services aren&#039;t accessible from internet. As far as I understandy, my router need to respond to incoming request with the same interface, so it need to respond with eth1. Issuing following commands fixes my problem:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>echo &quot;200 isp&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
ip route add default via MY GATEWAY_IP dev eth1 table isp
ip rule add from MY_ROUTER_IP table isp</code></pre></div><p>Now my router responds properly to incoming connections and I can access f.e. Transmission GUI, while VPN connection is active and all machines from my network uses VPN.<br />My question: is there any way to replace above commands with configuration options? Is it possible to add above route with config files and not manually with shell script?</p>									</div>
