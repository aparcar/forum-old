					<p>So I want to change the broadcom wifi interface in that router and upgrade to the 2.6 kernel but I&#039;m wondering which atheros chipset to target...</p><p>There are plenty of different cards avail from ebay, and I don&#039;t want to spend a lot but I&#039;m not sure which chipsets are supported by openWRT...</p><p>What about the AR2414A ? AR2425 ? AR5213A ? What have you guys got that works perfectly with the 2.6 kernel ?</p><p>What if I purchased an AR5416, will I get some speed improvement even w/o a MIMO antenna ?</p><p>Thanks for helping</p><p>--ouaibe.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ouaibe</strong> on 1 Nov 2009, 14:54)</p>
