					<p>This is outrageous ! All of these developers out here and not one in depth tutorial is available on the internet for someone who is trying to learn openwrt and it&#039;s linux system. If not even a beginner can read instructions and follow and be successful in what they are trying to accomplish then that shows that even the developer isn&#039;t too clear on what he is teaching. I don&#039;t want to come across as being demanding and rude but this is a cry for help from someone who is trying to setup OpenWRT for the first time with no experience in linux.</p>									</div>

					<p>@tmo26 I am the one crying for help here. If I knew how to write an in depth tutorial for openwrt God knows I would have done it by now. The&nbsp; difficulty that I am having is setting up netem. So far I downloaded kmod - netem via the available packages found in the webgui and when I try to enter the commands in &quot;putty&quot; I get the RTNETLINK answers: no such file or directory available. I then came across some files of netem that should be installed via SSH but do not know exactly where to put them. The files are as such: <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1) README.nd<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2) Makefile (luci-app folder)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3) netem.lua (controller folder)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4) netem.lua (cbi folder)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5) Makefile (netem-control folder) <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6) netem.uci (netem control folder)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7) netem.init (netem control folder)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8) netem.config (netem control folder) <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9) netem-control.lua (sbin folder)</p><p>These above are the files in their respective folders from the openwrt netem master zip file that I downloaded. I would like to know where does each file from each folder go in in the openwrt router via SSH, and are these files sufficient to run netem commands after being installed. (NB My webgui under installed packages says I have kmod sched etc. installed)</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve had my own frustrations with finding information on how to do some things on OpenWRT, but you know what I think is outrageous? Your self-centered sense of entitlement.</p><p>Rather than ranting and throwing a tantrum, why don&#039;t you make the effort of asking intelligent questions? Instead you seem to think that there is someone out there who can read your mind AND has the time and knowledge give you exactly the instructions you need to do what you are trying to do.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you Zloop for your response and to you EAS, you sir are a clown. What I simply asked for was a tutorial for netem, but since you had not written a tutorial I believe you yourself are still inexperienced with openwrt. For those who are in my situation, setting up netem is simple. First download the modules that netem requires through putty: kerenel_netem (install opkg kernel_netem) and iproute2 (install opkg ip). Secondly make sure that the module (sch_netem) is running using the command lsmod. If it is not running install the netem mod with the command insmod sch_netem. From there you can enter your commands associated with netem. Thank you and your welcome.</p>									</div>
