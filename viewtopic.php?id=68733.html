					<p>I am working with a &quot;no brand&quot; AP with Chaos Calmer 15.05, I want to set a configuration in one AP and then copy it to further APs, for that I am using the &quot;backup&quot; and &quot;restore&quot; configuration.&nbsp; This method works but I am having one issue, the MAC address of the ethernet interface is re-written with the original MAC of the AP that generated the backup and I end up with APs that have the same ethernet MAC. The WIFI MAC is unchanged though.</p><p>Is there any way to do a restore backup avoiding re-writing the MAC of the ethernet if ?</p><p>Thank for your help.</p>									</div>
