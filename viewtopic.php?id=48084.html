					<p>I need a cheap router which has 1 ethernet in and atleast 3 ethernet outs.&nbsp; I also need atleast 1 USB port.&nbsp; It&#039;d also be good if it has easy serial access because I have an arduino. </p><p>I want it to be easily flashable. It&#039;s okay if it supports something else like DDWRT or Tomato. I want it to be as cheap as possible.</p>									</div>

					<p>Colors are usually used to show user default roles of the ports. In most cases by default you have one port for WAN and rest for LANs. WIth OpenWrt you can re-arrange it the way you want/need.<br />For the database of routers you can see <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start</a> . It&#039;s not perfect, but you should be able to find some router using it.</p>									</div>

					<p>trunk means that the last stable release doesn&#039;t support this device. However using &quot;snapshot&quot; (a version/tree that will became BB release) should be fine for you. Once BB will be released, you can use it.</p>									</div>
