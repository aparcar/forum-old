					<p>Hi all. I am a university student currently in my third of year of undergrad in Software Engineering, and want to get some experience in low level embedded development. I have also been using OpenWrt for one of my side projects, and I am now looking for a way to contribute to its development.</p><p>I have never contributed to an open source project before, so I am not sure how to start contributing. Ideally, I would like to contribute to a module/feature that will help me improve my understanding of low level operating systems concepts, as well as C/C++. </p><p>If anyone has any suggestions/pointers on where to start, that would be greatly appreciated. I am a fast learner and have been using Openrwt quite actively for the past 4 months.</p><p>Cheers</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>johnpeng47</strong> on 6 Nov 2017, 20:32)</p>

					<p>i think you should be looking here: <a href="https://lede-project.org/docs/guide-developer/start">https://lede-project.org/docs/guide-developer/start</a></p><p>Openwrt is not really being actively developed as i know it. The new LEDE project is based entirely on Openwrt so you will be able to do some good there.</p>									</div>
