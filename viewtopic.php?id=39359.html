					<p>I meanwhile found some sort of solution ...</p><p>The SD card of the e353 is available before the usb_modeswitch ... after the switch, the SD is gone - but the modem available.<br />I replaced the values in the shipped usb_modeswitch data files with the following command:<br />usb_modeswitch -v 12d1 -p 1446 -V 012d1 -P 014db -M &quot;55534243123456780000000000000a11062000000000000100000000000000&quot; -W<br />Although usb_modeswitch says &quot;prop. not successful&quot; - it unlocks the mode, but keeps the SD card enabled, too ...</p><p>Can the above line integrated in the usb_modeswitch data files, somehow too? Simply replacing the values did not work ...</p><p>CH</p>									</div>
