					<p>While patching and upgrading my router with the latest OpenSSL, many programs were uninstalled in the process, most importantly SSH. After a regular boot, I have no way to access the router, as OpenSSH has been uninstalled and for some reason, nginx/LuCI aren&#039;t starting. </p><p>I&#039;ve managed to boot into failsafe mode, but I can&#039;t seem to download packages as it isn&#039;t connected to the internet, only to the local computer over telnet. How can I install openssh-server while in failsafe mode?</p>									</div>

					<p>I hacked myself another way. I downloaded all the required package files from the package repository, and netcatted them over TCP to the server from a local ethernet connection while booted in failsafe.</p><p>There aren&#039;t instructions over there for starting up an internet connection to the outside world on the router in the generic.failsafe instructions. Believe me, I looked.</p>									</div>
