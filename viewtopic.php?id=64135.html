I try to configure the wireless interface as mesh point by using the below commands, By run these commands I am able to see the mesh interface &quot;mesh0&quot; but it&#039;s not functional. I mean not even single packet is going onto the air.</p><p>root@OpenWrt:/# iw dev wlan0 interaface add mesh0 type mp<br />root@OpenWrt:/# ifconfig mesh0<br />mesh0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Link encap:Ethernet&nbsp; HWaddr A4:2B:B0:D6:FF:2E<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BROADCAST MULTICAST&nbsp; MTU:1500&nbsp; Metric:1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)&nbsp; TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)<br />root@OpenWrt:/# ifconfig mesh0 192.168.3.1 up<br />root@OpenWrt:/# iw dev mesh0 mesh join Test_MESH</p><br /><p>Could you please provide inputs or suggestions how could I up the wireless interface as a mesh point up and running on TL-WR1043ND router.</p><p>Is this openwrt firmware for the router &quot;TL-WR1043ND&quot; supports mesh network?

					<p>It&#039;s hard to find information for mesh on OpenWrt. This is the config I use in /etc/config/wireless.&nbsp; Note that this is not encrypted as I&#039;ve not found documentation on how to do it properly. Put this on both routers and the LAN&#039;s should be connected together via the mesh. Make sure you have compiled in mesh support. Mine routers use MAC80211 drivers and it&#039;s located at Kernel modules--&gt;Wireless Drivers--&gt;kmod-mac80211</p><p>config wifi-iface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option device&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;radio0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option network&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;lan&#039; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option encryption&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;none&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option mode&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;mesh&#039; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option mesh_id&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;Test_Mesh&#039;</p><p>Then you should be able to add an AP on the same interface if you like (though that will slow things down as the same radio has to rebroadcast) </p><p>config wifi-iface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option device&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;radio0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option network&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option mode&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;ap&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ssid&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;Test Ap&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option encryption&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;psk2+tkip+aes&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option key&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;&lt;wireless key&gt;&#039;</p>									</div>
