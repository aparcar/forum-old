					<p>I have gone through and flashed all 6 provided latest attitude adjustment images from April this year, one after another, and the end result of each flashing was that the router eventually came up with a solid and permanent red diag light. I then wrongly assumed the flash had gone wrong, when in fact it was successfully.<br />All I had to do was use telnet and start accessing it. Which I only discovered on second day and &quot;by accident&quot;.</p><p>Two questions really?<br />One, how to I get it to bring the normal expected lights on , and how do I change especially the wrong behaviour of the red diag light?</p><p>Secondly, what do I do best to make sure this does get &quot;fixed&quot; so others after me don&#039;t also assume a bad flash on the basis off that solid red permanent diag light being on?</p><p>What&#039;s the best steps I should follow to help get this resolved? Is it maybe a new revision of my WZR hp g300nh2 that has this issue when maybe the reference one that the April build was tested against did work correctly and not show this potentially misleading permanent red diag light?</p>									</div>
