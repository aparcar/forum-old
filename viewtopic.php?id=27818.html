					<p>I have a Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH and was running 10.03, and upgraded (using the openwrt-ar71xx-wzr-hp-g300nh-jffs2-sysupgrade.bin image via luci) to the nightly trunk snapshot build from 19 Dec 2010. The upgrade went fine and almost all settings were retained. The base snapshot images don&#039;t have luci though, so I installed the kmod-* packages I use from the snapshot packages and switched the opkg.conf to using the 10.03.1-rc4 packages feed. After installing luci and a few luci-app packages, I can&#039;t get the management site to appear. uhttpd is running and appears to be trying to start, but I get the following stacktrace (get the same thing trying to execute /www/cgi-bin/luci directly:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/usr/lib/lua/luci/dispatcher.lua:160: /etc/config/luci seems to be corrupt, unable to find section &#039;main&#039;
stack traceback:
    [C]: in function &#039;assert&#039;
    /usr/lib/lua/luci/dispatcher.lua:160: in function &#039;dispatch&#039;
    /usr/lib/lua/luci/dispatcher.lua:143: in function &lt;/usr/lib/lua/luci/dispatcher.lua:142&gt;</code></pre></div><p>I&#039;ve verified that the /etc/config/luci exists, in fact I&#039;ve reset it to defaults by deleting it and reinstalling luci-web. The beginning of the config file contains the following at the beginning (and then the rest of the file as well):</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;core&#039; &#039;main&#039;

        option &#039;resourcebase&#039; &#039;/luci-static/resources&#039;
        option &#039;mediaurlbase&#039; &#039;/luci-static/openwrt-light&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Any ideas on why this would be occurring?</p>									</div>

					<p>You&#039;re using a trunk snapshot build (bleeding edge), but installing packages from the Backfire 10.03.1 rc4 feed... the two may not be compatible.&nbsp; If you&#039;re going to use trunk, there is no reason to update opkg.conf... just use the packages from trunk as well.&nbsp; Alternatively, install the Backfire 10.03.1 rc4 image instead of trunk if you want the latest &quot;release&quot;.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah, I realize that things might not jive completely (app modules not fully functional), but I expect that the initial web page should at least be served up. I initially installed the luci packages from the snapshots repo and had the same issue, but figured that luci might just be in an unstable state since it&#039;s bumped to a 0.10svnXXX version and changing the package allocation. If someone knows for sure otherwise then by all means let me know, but nothing in the intervening changesets I saw would seem to indicate a gross incompatibility.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, two things come to mind.&nbsp; I think trunk uses LuCI trunk (v10), while 10.03.1 rc4 uses LuCI v9... it&#039;s a big change, but don&#039;t know if that is causing your problem.&nbsp; The other is when you updated, it looks like you retained your configuration files.&nbsp; There may be an incompatibility in the configuration files from one version to the next (looks like the error you are receiving may be related).&nbsp; I would suggest wiping out your JFFS partition to restore to the default configuration... or reflashing without electing to retain the configuration files... you&#039;ll have reconfigure the router after of course.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah, I had planned on reflashing the router without retaining configuration later, but was hoping there was an option that didn&#039;t require that, both for ease, and support/testing.</p>									</div>

					<p>One simple question, why didn&#039;t you just install the trunk version of luci? It should work way better for ar71xx devices.</p>									</div>

					<p>I did first attempt to install the trunk version of luci - however appeared to have the same issue, which is why I tried the 0.9+ version. In thinking back however, I&#039;m not sure it was the same issue, I think luci was installed but uhttpd wasn&#039;t so it wasn&#039;t even getting the connection instead of the runtime error. Perhaps a missing dependency from luci to uhttpd or maybe I did something weird in how I set it up.</p><p>I&#039;ll experiment with the x86 version in a VirtualBox setup and then report back - I don&#039;t want to be too invasive to the router until I have a better approach for a reattempt, but if I can get the trunk of luci too, that&#039;d be even better. As an aside, what is improved for ar71xx support?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mrjoel</strong> on 23 Dec 2010, 00:35)</p>
