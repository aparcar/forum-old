					<p>There is no recommended device list AFAIK. I think supported hardware list is pretty straightforward. <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start</a><br />Cheapest supported device is Tp-link WR703N and it does get enough for medium sized application load, as roguhly saying.</p>									</div>

					<p>cheers</p><p>I&#039;d seen the list, but with so much on it I thought I&#039;d ask about favoured devices - maybe something has great spec/performance or whatever.</p><p>That TPLink looks neat but I suspect an internal antennae isn&#039;t going to cut it for my needs.</p>									</div>

					<p>I generally suggest something with an easy soldable serial port and with 8MB of disk. And of course, you asked for a usb port ;-)<br />Depending of what you want to run on it, maybe you&#039;ll need some more than 32 MB of RAM. Check the supported device lists for the wanted features and search what is available in the market for you</p>									</div>
