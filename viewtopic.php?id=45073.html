					<p>Hi,</p><p>I`ve installed Openwrt 12.09 RC and final version, and on both I couldn`t connect my HP Photosmart D110a printer to the network anymore. The diagnostic test of the printer says I have the mac adress filter enabled, but it is disabled.</p><p>When I rollback to the original router firmware, the printer works fine.</p><p>My router is a TPLINK WR2543ND.</p><p>Thanks for any help.</p>									</div>

					<p>I face the same problem with a HP Photosmart C410. It seems to be absolutely impossible to connect the device via Wifi, the stupid printer always says that the MAC adress filter is enabled. A lot of people seem to have problems with those HP printers and Wifi, especially in combination with Verizon routers. <br />In a posting a HP support guy mentioned that the &quot;MAC filter enabled&quot; error is the very last error the printer shows. So if the printer has no clue what the error is it shows the &quot;MAC filter enabled&quot; error what caused a lot of confusion, at least for me ..... like &quot; else { print(&#039;MAC filter enabled&#039;)&quot;.</p><p>Unfortunately I did not find a solution. Neither changing encryption, setting an easier WPA key, playing around with Wifi bands, .... worked. On my old WRT54gl running stock Linksys firmware it worked without any problems. </p><p>I would also be extremely thankful if anyone finds a solution.</p>									</div>

					<p>I spent another hour and finally found the solution for my problem. The printer seems to have trouble with some Wifi channels. I now switched to channel 9 and it finally worked.</p>									</div>
