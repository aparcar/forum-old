					<p>Hi all!</p><p>Just a question:</p><p>If I want to build OpenWRT using the latest Linux kernel (currently 2.6.27), I understand I have to make a change in the target Makefile for my platform and set the LINUX_VERSION variable to what I want.</p><p>But I have seen there are also some kernel version number specific patches for the currently used 2.6.25 kernel. Will I have to deal with these, i.e. review and port the patches to the latest version? Can I expect the plain vanilla 2.6.27 kernel to at least boot or not without porting these patches?</p><p>Regards,<br />Torsten</p>									</div>
