					<p>ALSA is installed.

Thus I want to install mpg123 to OpenWRT too.</p><p>Another option is to install some additional MP3 codec, but I do not know how.</p><p>Could you please elaborate on &quot;Looks like you did not compile in ALSA driver, or it could not find the OSS / ALSA library.&quot;</p>									</div>
