					<p>If you get this last message, this is probably because you already connected, earlier, to some SSH daemon at a 192.168.1.1 address, from the client machine (the one where you input &quot;ssh root@192.168.1.1&quot;, ie your &quot;nanotech-laptop)&quot;, and then, reinstalled what is on this address, or plugged another device instead, and gave 192.168.1.1 as its address.</p><p>You may not know that there are not only connection SSH keypairs, fo your users, but also another pair, to identify the host you are trying to connect to : these ones are generally located in &quot;/etc/ssh/&quot;, where they are files like &quot;ssh_host_rsa_key&quot; and &quot;ssh_host_rsa_key.pub&quot;, on the host you are trying to connect to.</p><p>As those keys are automatically generated on the first install of sshd, when you reflash your router, they are changed... but they remain on your client machine, in ~/.ssh/known_hosts (as for the public part of the key).</p><p>This way, if somebody tried to eavesdrop you, making you believe that you are trying to connect to your well known host, he would need this key, if you already had connected to this host : if the key the host you are trying to connect to doesn&#039;t correspond to the one in your &quot;~/.ssh/known_hosts&quot;, you will get this message. This is just to be sure you are connecting to a legitimate host (and this is why, the first time you try to connect to one, your SSH client should ask you if you accept the host identification key).</p><p>So, remove the line corresponding to your 192.168.1.1 host in the ~/.ssh/known_hosts on your client, or remove this file from your client if you don&#039;t care, and it will ask you again if you want to accept your server&#039;s host identification key (which I remind you identifies the machine, in addition to the user key, that identifies the user, or even in addition to your simple password, that only identifies users, if you do not use user&#039;s keypair to connect).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Aefron</strong> on 22 Oct 2008, 14:49)</p>
