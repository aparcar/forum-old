					<p>With building you can start here:<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build</a></p><p>But preparing a package for openwrt is rather advanced stuff. After you will clone openwrt git, try to compile for your router without your package first. Once you manage to do that, you will have to clone mc git, create some files, create new &quot;mc&quot; folder in package folder and place it all there. Here you can start:<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/packages">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/packages</a></p><p>Best is to take a look on some existing package, which will give you good example.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 7 Mar 2018, 22:34)</p>

					<p>&quot;Compare files&quot; is not a new feature of 4.8.20 ... LEDE 17.01.x ships with mc 4.8.18 which also supports this - but not by default. Due to space considerations only popular extensions (like internal edit) are enabled by default. To get mc with &quot;Compare files&quot; feature you have to setup your own buildroot environment and select the mc compile option &quot;Enable internal diff viewer&quot;.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the explanation... I would have found out that the latest version on OpenWrt did not have this feature <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />...</p>									</div>
