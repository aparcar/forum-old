					<p>Hi everyone</p><p>I am trying to get a D-Link Router DIR-615 H1 with OpenWrt working. As I tried several things but couldn&#039;t get it work, I ask for help here. Thank you in advance for your support!</p><p><strong>Trial set-up</strong><br />(Background for the trial: see below)<br />Goal: connect two subnets with a D-Link DIR 615 H1 let&#039;s call this router D.<br />Router E is attached to the internet. Router F (an old ZyXel) creates a second subnet. Router E and F are not connected at this stage.<br />Now the D-Link is attached between the two. On both routers (E and F) I added a static route for the other subnet with the IP of the D-LInk in the corresponding subnet as next hop.<br />I first tried with the stock firmware of the D-LInk, unsing the wan port for subnet F. Couldn&#039;t get it run.<br />Then I tried dd-wrt. Switched mode to routing. No success either. As dd-wrt is not supporting vlans on non-Broadcom devices and the GUI is difficult to understand for a newbie, I decided to try OpenWrt.<br />Here I tried four things<br />1) Reconfigure the firewall settings for the wan interface and add an additonal port to the vlan. Then connecting the F subnet to the one of the tow ports.The E subnet to one of the remaining lan ports. No success.<br />2) Add a new interface with one port for the F subnet. Add the interface to the same zone as &quot;lan&quot; in the firewall<br />3) Same as 2) but a new zone in the firewall<br />4) Same as 2) but disabled firewall</p><p>Interesting: tracert (with an IP of the E subnet) in the F subnet arrives at the D-Link router, but does not go further. Unless it is the E-IP of the D-Link. That works. Tracert in the E subnet (for an F subnet IP) is sent to the internet (static route seems not to be working, but maybe just because D-Link is not working and then the router tries the default gateway).</p><p><strong>Question</strong><br />Which settings would be needed on the D-Link to behave like intended?<br />I downloaded OpenWrt from<br />(even it&#039;s an openWrt link, the forum does not allow me to post it..)<br />OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05.1<br />I am using the LuCI GUI.</p><p>--------------------<br />read this, if you want to know more about why I am trying this<br /><strong>Background</strong><br />I have three subnets. router A is a Gateway and offers public internet access. Router B&#039;s wan port is attached to a LAN port of Router A. The same holds true for router C. That said, subnets B and C are independent and located &quot;inside&quot; A.<br />Now certain clients in subnet B need access to certain clients in subnet C. Generally not all clients of B and C should see each other.<br />There are different methods to achieve this:<br />Method 1: Static routes on router A.<br />(the forum does not allow me to provide you the link)<br />Problem here was, a) I do not really like the solution, as traffic goes through the public network, b) I was not able to configure the firewalls router B and C (on one of them NAT needs to stay active).<br />Method 2: Connect the two routers directly<br />(the forum does not allow me to provide the link, would be for method 2 and 3)<br />Not possible as the routers stock firmware does not support more than two interfaces. I can not play around/mess with those hence no flashing of the firmware.<br />Method 3: Connect the subnets over an aditional router.<br />That&#039;s where I need help.<br />-------------------</p><p>Best regards</p>									</div>
