					<p>With the low amount of devs working on DD I doubt it will be released soon.

					<p>Nobody really knows what the future holds for OpenWrt and LEDE, judging from mailing list activity not even the devs themselves. Even more interestingly, the devs don&#039;t really seem to care that much about the divide as long as they have an environment they can work in again -- apparantly that was the point of LEDE in the first place, since OpenWrt didn&#039;t sufficiently provide it anymore.</p><p>OpenWrt and LEDE might merge again in the future. OpenWrt might pull in LEDE&#039;s changes and release an own stable (much like Gargoyle, to an extent, does). OpenWrt might release the current state of trunk as an RC and later as a stable without LEDE&#039;s changes. And of course LEDE might very well turn out the way to go forward, that seems to be the most likely outcome from our current perspective. My point is that there are a few possibilities, and even more variations in between. Remember: Open Source is cross-pollination.</p><p>That&#039;s why it&#039;s so aggravating that our resident forum troll just straight up answers posts with &quot;OpenWrt is dead&quot;. He knows exactly the same we do, i.e. jack shit, but that sure doesn&#039;t stop him from answering in absolutes.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 17 Jul 2016, 09:48)</p>

					<p>Apples and oranges, right?
