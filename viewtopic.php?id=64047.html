					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;ve got 2 openwrt devices in my network - <br />one gateway and one&#039;s just acting as AP/switch.</p><p>The AP uses DHCP and gets its address from the gateway.</p><p>Now my question: what do I have to set in the IPv6 Part of the AP?<br />Router Advertisement-Service<br />DHCPv6-Service<br />NDP-Proxy</p><p>Available: Server Mode, Relay Mode, Hybrid Mode, Disabled</p><p>I would go with Disabled or Relay, but I&#039;m not sure...</p><p>I&#039;ve configured my WAN port on the AP as LAN (added eth1 to br-lan) because all 5 ports on the device are connected.</p><p>Another issue:<br />I&#039;ve installed avahi on each machine,<br />but I can&#039;t ping &#039;AP.local&#039; from any machine in the network. Any other host.local works fine. What could be the issue?</p><p>Thanks</p><p>EDIT: whoops, wrong topic - moved.</p>									</div>
