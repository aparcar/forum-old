					<p>I just flashed BB 39304 this weekend and it would appear that at least the stability of the wifi has improved (perhaps related to this: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/14418?).">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/14418?).</a> The overall signal is still significantly worse as I can see from the windows wifi panel and on my android wifi analyzer (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farproc.wifi.analyzer">https://play.google.com/store/apps/deta … i.analyzer</a>). Generally it seems to be a difference of about 10db. And that is with upgraded antennas. The APs (my old dd-wrt based WNR3500L and the TP-Link 4300 v1.6) are literally sitting next to each other, so it&#039;s hard to imagine that somehow there&#039;s more interference.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />I just got a new WDR4300 v1.7 - a quick search here tells me that this isnt really supported yet by openwrt - but there isnt a lot of information regarding this. Does anyone have any updates/info regarding openwrt and V1.7 of this router? Any idea if this will be supported by openwrt?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
