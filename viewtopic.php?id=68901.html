					<p>Hi, I&#039;m having a lot of problems getting ipv6 working on Chaos Calmer.&nbsp; What&#039;s happening is that I can ping ipv6 addresses from the router itself, but clients cannot (100% packet loss) even though they are getting assigned ipv6 addresses.&nbsp; My ISP doesn&#039;t do prefix delegation it appears so I have been trying to get the relay configuration working.Here&#039;s what my configuration looks like.</p><p><em>/etc/config/dhcp:</em></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config dnsmasq

					<p>I also have access to an ISP which only sends RAs and nothing more. No DHCPv6 at all.<br />Tried setup relaying but it doesnt work.<br />May be ISP does not want to serve multiple neighbors on the same MAC. Or checks that originating MAC is equal to link layer address in icmpv6 message, drops if not equal.<br />I tested RA/NDP relaying works in internal networks.<br />This ISP does not claim to support ipv6 at all. Only in limited locations and only by request they enable DHCP6-PD</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bolvan</strong> on 11 Dec 2016, 12:13)</p>

					<p>Here&#039;s how NDP proxy worked for me. I assume you have already setup the wan6 interface and you can ping ipv6.google.com from the router.</p><p>1) Install package ip or ip-full, and nano for easy editing of text files.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>opkg update<br />opkg install ip<br />opkg install nano</p></blockquote></div><p>2) Uninstall the odhcpd package that comes with CC 15.05.1. Trying to use this odhcpd version with NDP proxy setting lead to a crash loop in my setup.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>opkg remove odhcpd</p></blockquote></div><p>3) Install the odhcpd package from CC 15.05. Go to <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05/</a> and find the correct file for your platform.

					<p>I agree with AndreL,</p><p>It could be that your devices behind the router are not resolving DNS correctly.

					<p>Tonyquan,</p><p>If odhcpd is working for the first 5 minutes, it sounds like neighbour entries are aging out on the router, and for some reason aren&#039;t being refreshed. You may try to put in a static neighbour entry on the router (think like a static arp entry) for one of your PCs and see if will still ping after 5 minutes. I am not suggesting that this is a final solution, but a way of troubleshooting.</p><p>Adding a static entry with the ip command:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>sudo ip neigh add 2001:470:ebbd:4:6221:c0ff:fee0:8e0a lladdr 60:21:c0:e0:8e:0a dev br-lan</code></pre></div>									</div>

					<p>cvmiller--thanks for the tips.&nbsp; I had to change your suggestion slightly as there was an entry already there for my LAN host, instead I did:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ip neighbor change 2602:306:cd66:24b0:88b:eb1:54b8:f13c lladdr a8:66:7f:03:b3:7f dev br-lan</code></pre></div><p>where those addresses are the ipv6 and mac addresses of the LAN host, and I got this entry in &quot;ip neighbor&quot;</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>2602:306:cd66:24b0:88b:eb1:54b8:f13c dev br-lan lladdr a8:66:7f:03:b3:7f PERMANENT</code></pre></div><p>After that, I checked and my LAN host was able to ping ipv6.google.com. I then turned off my cronjob hack, and waited 15 minutes.&nbsp; However it looks like your theory is incorrect, because after the 15 minutes, I was once again unable to ping ipv6.google.com.&nbsp; restarting odhcpd once again allowed me to ping ipv6 hosts.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi djgend,</p><p>My working setup is with &quot;config dhcp &#039;wan&#039;&quot;. Not sure if it would make any difference to put &quot;wan6&quot;. There was a lot of trial and error here. I&#039;m sorry, just can&#039;t remember the &quot;whys&quot;.</p><p>The crash loop is what I got with the odhcpd version that came with CC 15.05.1.

Everytime the upstream router sends an unsolicited RA, odhcpd would send itself an RA to the LAN side with router_lifetime=0 and no prefix information. This was essentially breaking/resetting wifi connectivity on Android hosts every 3 minutes or so. It depends on the frequency that the upstream router sends its RA.
