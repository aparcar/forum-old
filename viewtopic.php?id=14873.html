					<p>Hi,<br />I am running kamikaze 7.09 on a Linksys wrt54.<br />I have setup a lot of port forwarding rules to make some servers available to the outer world.<br />Everything works fine for quite some uptime (usually hours - sometimes days).</p><p>After a while (quite likely under heavy traffic load), the internal port forwarding rules get messed up:<br />* the router starts to redirect packets to different destinations (the destination IP or the destination port changes)<br />* the firewall rules (as displayed by &quot;iptables -L -vn&quot; and &quot;iptables -t nat -L -vn&quot;) still seem to be correct</p><p>The problem has the following symptoms:<br />1) packets do not get forwarded -&gt; the service is unreachable<br />2) &quot;DROP&quot; messages of the specific packets start to appear in &quot;dmesg&quot;</p><p>Restarting the firewall scripts does not help.<br />Reloading of ipt-modules does not help.<br />Reboot helps -&gt; afterwards the router works as expected again.</p><p>I tried exactly the same setup with two different Linksys WRT54. Both show the same behaviour.</p><p>Somehow I have the feeling, that the internal representation of the iptables rules gets messed up under certain conditions.<br />I don&#039;t see any error logs in dmesg (except for the DROP packets).</p><p>My current (ugly) &quot;workaround&quot; for this problem is a cron job, that runs every minute and reboots the machine, if it greps the specific DROP packets in &quot;dmesg&quot;. That results in quite a lot of downtime (while rebooting) - but at least there are no hours of downtime (this happened without reboot).</p><p>The same devices worked flawlessly with white russian before - with a similar setup.</p><p>Do you have any ideas, how I can debug this issue?</p><p>Should I attach some information (ouptut of &quot;iptables -L -vn&quot; or dmesg)? It only works inline in this forum - right?</p><p>Any helping advice would be great!<br />thanks for your time,<br />Lars</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi yapoo,</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>yapoo wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Which kernel version do you use, 2.4 or 2.6?<br />We have a similar issue when wifidog gateway is running.<br />zukky</p></blockquote></div><p>sorry - I forgot about this important piece of information:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> # uname -a
 Linux OpenWrt 2.4.34 #3 Sun Sep 30 20:33:21 CEST 2007 mips unknown</code></pre></div><p>Your issues sounds really similar to mine - but I am not using wifidog here <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />The wireless interface (wpa2) is used only by two or three people. And none of them were around, during many occasions of that problem.</p><p>So it seems to be something different - but thanks a lot for your reply - at least I had some hope for a second <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><br /><p>To make the problem a little bit more clear, I added two of my port forwarding rules below and the resulting dmesg output for the DROPed packets, which (from my point of view) may never exist:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> # iptables -t nat -L -vn

But there are no iptables rules for this combination (port 25 should be redirected to another host; IP 192.168.1.25 is used for other ports).</p><p>I could add the complete output of &quot;ipkg list_installed&quot;, ps, iptables and dmesg, if that is necessary. For clarity, I tried to keep the amount of information small, but useful - tell me, if I failed <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Any other thoughts would be great!</p>									</div>

					<p>I keep seeing this problem being reported.&nbsp; The problem follows with multiport nat on the 2.4 kernel.&nbsp; I use only single port DNATs and have never experienced the problem.&nbsp; </p><p>I&#039;ve suggested in the past this problem be brought to the the netfilter mailing list and bug tracker.&nbsp; I do not regularly follow that list, so I can&#039;t say if it has been pursued by anyone.</p>									</div>
