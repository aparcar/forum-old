					<p>I`ve just updated to r10140 and my dg834 is taking really long to sync , so i got o doubt.<br />Taking a look at avsar_modem_training i can see it fails 13 times before sync. Is it trying all dsl_modulation modes before get to the right one ?</p><p># cat /proc/avalanche/avsar_modem_training <br />SHOWTIME<br />1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; --------------&gt; WHAT DOES THIS LINE MEAN ?[sometimes = 0 ]<br />failTrains=13</p><br /><p>Another thing :</p><p>#&nbsp; cat /proc/avalanche/avsar_modem_stats&nbsp; | grep -i&nbsp; train<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Trained Path:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;US Peak Cell Rate:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 377<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Trained Mode:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Selected Mode:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1</p><br /><p>Trained Mode = 3 means it is using 0x3 as modulation ? [GDMT according to /proc/avalanche/avsar_dsl_modulation_schemes&nbsp; ]<br />If it is , why if i set SETENV modulation,GDMT in adam2 i can never sync at all ? In my opinion setting this would make sync much faster , wouldn`t it ?</p>									</div>
