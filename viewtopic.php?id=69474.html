					<p>I just installed Chaos Calmer (trunk) plus the system upgrade on my Netgear WNR1000V2. Every thing went well (LuCi, etc.) up to a point I messed up the FW setting. ouuups !</p><p>Now I am trying to accces the appliance in failsafe mode, but even if I succeed to boot in failsafe mode (with ping 192.168.1.1 answering rightly), I do not succeed, the device remains unreachable (t e l n e t, s s h, h t t p, etc.) all remain unsuccessful targeting 192.168.1.1 from client at 192.168.1.200/24</p><p>after a large number of hours I finally succeeded, here is what I learnt and what I did:</p><ul><li><p>the WNR1000V2 has a PCB 2976333104 on which you can find an UART at J2 position the details are &gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; h t t p <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" />/csmatt.com/notes/?p=76&quot;&gt; be careful it is a 3.3V UART (not a 5V)</p></li><li><p><strong>WNR1000V2 failsafe mode is achieved by keeping the reset button (the small hole at the rear) pressed all the time from before power-on to when the power led flashes continuously one flash per second (20 to 30 second should enough but if you are not sure take 1 minute).</strong> To verify that the WNR1000V2 is well is failsafe mode try to ping 192.168.1.1 (should the VNR1000V2 address) from a client at the static address like 192.168.1.10/24</p></li><li><p>if it works you have a great chance to recover your WNR1000V2 with one of two procedure: 1/via ethernet or 2/via the UART</p></li><li><p>via ethernet the procedure explained &gt;&gt;&gt; h t t p://cyberstorm.altervista.org/wag354g/guides/howto_unbricking_wag354g_en.txt&quot; worked perfectly for me</p></li><li><p>Qwant search engine was thousand times more useful than Google to gather all the puzzle pieces - I have now decided to switch to Qwant</p></li></ul><p>Big thanks to all the people who wrote the text in the two links I mentioned</p><p>Hoping this will help all WNR1000V2 lucky owners to keep there device lively.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>regpa</strong> on 22 Jan 2017, 18:30)</p>
