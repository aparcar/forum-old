					<p>I&#039;ve just bought a chromecast. It works fine with wireless devices, however I&#039;m having difficulty connecting to it from wired devices. For example, in the chrome browser, if I scan for devices from the chrome page it doesn&#039;t find anything.</p><p>I&#039;ve seen some posts that talked about enabling or disabling /sys/devices/virtual/net/br-lan/bridge/multicast_snooping however this hasn&#039;t made any difference for me.</p><p>My network configuration has the x.x.0.x range for dhcp clients and x.x.1.x for static assignments. I have tried connecting to chromecast from a wired machine in each of those ranges and it hasn&#039;t made any difference, so I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a subnet issue.</p><p>Is there any special configuration that anybody&#039;s aware of to make chromecast work?</p><p>I&#039;m using BARRIER BREAKER (14.07, r42625) if that makes any difference.</p>									</div>
