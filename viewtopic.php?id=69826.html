					<p>Since flashing to OpenWrt,I have noticed that some basics simply do not work. The first of these I&#039;m trying to tackle is the fact that the LEDS for the radios do not work at all. After investigation around the OpenWrt Luci config pages, I found a section for system LEDs. I added the 2.4g radio and 5g radio, associated with the appropriate triggers, then rebooted the router and now it no longer reboots effectively. I am not sure if I have bricked the router but it looks like it. I thought you could only brick the router by doing an incorrect flash of the firmware. How do i recover my router? How do I know if it is bricked or not? I can&#039;t ping the router successfully or telnet/putty into the router, or access LuCI via the browser. I can no longer browse to it in windows explorer. Only 2 lights are in operation, the power light which flashes constantly at a steady rate of about once per second and the internet light, which is mostly on steady state, but occasionally blinks.<br />Also, both radios still appear to be working, I can see both SSIDs and am connected to the 5G radio, so I suppose it can&#039;t be bricked, but I can&#039;t do anything with it, or so it appears.</p><p>Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Zephilim</strong> on 13 Feb 2017, 14:32)</p>

					<p>I couldn&#039;t even get the 5GHz radio to start with LEDE 17.01 snapshot on mine. I believe it&#039;s a known issue that enabling LEDs for WiFi on 3200 kills the WiFi.</p>									</div>

					<p>There are lots of ways to brick your router, the good thing about some current linksys routers like the wrt series is that they have 2 partitions, so pretty much impossible to brick. To boot into the other partition if you can&#039;t ssh, you use the 3 failed boot method, meaning you turn it on, wait a few seconds and then turn it off before it successfully boots, do that 3 times and on the 4th time leave it turned on and hopefully you&#039;ll be in the working partition, so - </p><p>on/off</p><p>on/off</p><p>on/off</p><p>on/leave on</p><p>It might take a few tries to get the timing right, so if it doesn&#039;t work the first time, try again.</p><p>As for your leds, there were some problems with the leds on the wrt series and the 3200 had the most problems from what i remember, they were working on it over at lede but i don&#039;t know what the situation at openwrt is with the leds on the wrt series. In Luci you can go to System&gt;Led Configuration and try to set up the leds there, it&#039;s safer that way than going into configs.</p><p>edit - since it just kills the wifi you don&#039;t need to bother with the 3 failed boots</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mikemccartney</strong> on 13 Feb 2017, 22:39)</p>

					<p>Ok, thanks mikemccartney and stangri. Ok, so I need to take a step back. What is LEDE. Through all the browsing I have done, I keep seeing glimpses of what LEDE is, but I need a proper introduction. Is OpenWrt being phased out? Also, I have heard about the 2nd partition, but again only in passing without finding a proper document on it. If you could help me find these then tha would be a great start.</p>									</div>

If I do reflash to LEDE, where will it go? First or second partition?</p>									</div>

					<p>Be warned, LEDE prevents flashing back to OEM or other 3rd-party firmware via guy. If you want to use wireless then the only option is to use the OEM firmware for now.
