					<p>Hello All,</p><p>I have a nighthawk x6.&nbsp; I recently attempted to flash OpenWRT 15.05.1 to it.&nbsp; It&#039;s behaving as it&#039;s corrupted.&nbsp; Some values appear to be stick in NVRAM and I believed I cleared it.&nbsp; Well, I researched and tried everything just short of JTAGing it.&nbsp; It&#039;s not bricked since I&#039;m able to ping at boot up 192.168.1.1 in recovery mode.&nbsp; I just haven&#039;t been able to 30-30-30 hard reset either.&nbsp; At this point I&#039;m at a loss on how further to proceed other than JTAGing it and feed the commands directly via serial console.&nbsp; Below are my troubleshooting methods.</p><p>30-30-30 hard reset multiple times<br />Can ping to 192.168.1.1 at boot<br />Used multiple TFTP programs to reflash<br />Attempted to clear NVRAM via WPS switch<br />SSH is active but can&#039;t log into it (Tried everything)</p><p>Thanks for your time and attention,</p>									</div>

					<p>As you&#039;ve referenced nvram and 30-30-30 which are both alien to OpenWrt, you probably came from DD-WRT. I&#039;ve seen other people recommend go dd-wrt -&gt; stock -&gt; OpenWrt a few times, if you can TFTP flash, maybe try that route?</p>									</div>
