					<p>Hi, i&#039;m struggling to work out how to best achieve this, basically i have want to run a <br />openvpn server for in and out traffic when i am out and about.<br />a openvpn client to america that two devices on my internal network solely communicate through<br />and another openvpn client to Europe that another internal device talks solely through<br />then the remaining clients on my internal network just hit the external wan as normal.</p><p>I have my vpn server working ok, and both the client vpn connections working as and when i switch them on.<br />so i assume it&#039;s just a matter of telling specific clients to talk through specific interfaces, and if that interface goes down, stop talking.</p><p>Can any one suggest best solution to achieve this? do i setup a new interface and put them on it somehow? then route that through the vpn interface.. ? different dhcp scope? or do i need to setup mwan3 ? if so any pointers?</p><p>any suggestions will help thanks..</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>marktomlinson32</strong> on 10 Feb 2017, 07:50)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the reply, OK so to understand... you are saying just use this package.. ( not the vpn bypass one aswell) <br />then amend it to accommodate two vpn routes and then set policies accordingly.</p><br /><p>also before i install, what config files does this have interaction with? as in what do i need to backup before i install in case i have to revert.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>marktomlinson32</strong> on 10 Feb 2017, 10:34)</p>

					<p>I&#039;ve updated openvpn-policy-routing to version 3.0 which now supports multiple OpenVPN tunnels.</p><p>It uses its own config file (/etc/config/openvpn-policy-routing), which luci-app-openvpn-policy-routing modifies.</p><p>If you&#039;re not satisfied with it, just make sure to run /etc/init.d/openvpn-policy-routing stop (or stop service using Web UI) and uninstall openvpn-policy-routing and luci-app-openvpn-policy-routing.</p><p>If you have any additional questions on openvpn-policy-routing -- please post them in the thread I linked above.</p>									</div>

					<p>^go to diagnostics and set it up. else if its still down, probably you missed something on the configuration regarding the interfaces, that means each interface must have has its own metric value.</p>									</div>
