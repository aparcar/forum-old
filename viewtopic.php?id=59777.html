					<p>Hi,</p><p>Can someone advise on the best way of using an OpenWRT router as a syslog server? I could not find a way of using the default logger of a Barrier Breaker 14.07 for that purpose. Ideally I would like to be able to use it forward logs from my network to services like Loggly for collection and analysis.</p><p>I can see that Barrier Breaker has a package &quot;syslog-ng3&quot; which mostly does what I want to do, but it cannot perform JSON transformations due to lacking plugins. It looks like Chaos Calmer has lost the &quot;syslog-ng3&quot; altgether, at least for my router TP-Link TL-WR1043ND. Also the version supplied is pretty old, and in BB it apears in &quot;oldpackages&quot;.</p><p>Thank you in advance for any ideas or suggestions.</p>									</div>
