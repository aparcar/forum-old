					<p>I would appreciate your advise on selecting good model of Atheros-based router for running OpenWrt.<br />Preferably - 802.11n, having external detachable antenna is a plus.</p><p>I volunteered recently to install Wi-Fi network in my child&#039;s school.<br />I found in the school that room where they have Ethernet cable with Internet connection has enormously thick concrete walls - about 80cm!<br />Signal from my ASUS-WL500G (standard antenna) which I used for testing degrades significantly after that wall, and 10m after it comes almost to zero.<br />Notebook which I used has built-in Ralink (RT2500) adapter, with driver dated year 2004, so part of weakness can be this adapter itself.</p><p>Ok, I would install antenna with extra gain on central router (my guess is Linksys WRT-160NL so far) which would be connected to wired Ethernet.</p><p>There are some sticks which have 4dBi antenna.<br />I just bought TP-Link TL-WN722N (150Mbit, 11n) Wireless USB stick with External 4dBi antenna<br /><a href="http://www.tp-link.com/products/productDetails.asp?class=wlan&amp;pmodel=TL-WN722N">http://www.tp-link.com/products/product … =TL-WN722N</a></p><p>Test at home (via not very thick 2 concrete walls, from hall to kitchen) confirmed that wireless signal significantly improved, if I compare this USB stick to built-in Ralink RT2500.</p><p>Than I installed on ASUS WL-500G (54Mbit 11g) external antenna - TP-Link TL-ANT2406A 6dBi<br /><a href="http://www.tp-link.com/products/productDetails.asp?class=wlan&amp;pmodel=TL-ANT2406A">http://www.tp-link.com/products/product … L-ANT2406A</a><br />Built-in Ralink adapter on notebook is now capable to work from kitchen at 48Mbps-54Mbps (via 2 concrete walls).<br />And of course connection via TL-WN722N just flies.<br />So far, client-side solution seems to work fine.<br />Now I plan to re-test and see if it works in the school.</p><p>In addition to central router I would probably need 2-3 more which should not cost a lot.<br />As signal still can be too weak in some remote classes, possibility to change antenna to more powerful is certainly a plus.<br />Those routers would work as &quot;range extenders&quot; (wireless client) or in WDS, and with computer(s) connected to LAN ports.</p><p>Your suggestions?..</p>									</div>

					<p>tp-link router definitely.<br />the model depends on your budget.<br />I would recommend in the following order:<br />1)tl-wn1043nd<br />2)tl-wn941nd<br />3)tl-wn841nd<br />4)tl-wn741nd<br />maybe that budget will allow you to change the stock antennas with 5 or 8dBi antennas - TL-ANT2405CL or TL-ANT2408CL<br />be sure to check if the hw rev you buy is compatible with openwrt (or dd-wrt if you preffer)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>maurer</strong> on 20 Sep 2010, 12:31)</p>

					<p>Thank you, <em>maurer</em>!</p><p>I indeed became interested in TP-Link routers, after the purchase of Wi-Fi USB stick and 6dBi antenna TL-ANT2406A.<br />As it was just yesterday, I have to get used to this brand, absolutely new to me.</p><p>When I was asking question &quot;which router to buy&quot; about 3 years ago<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=12609">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=12609</a><br />selection was just between Linksys and ASUS<br />I am very happy that we have better choice today, with more vendors/models available.</p><p>Which model from your list do you own?<br />How stable it is?<br />I have seem info in forums that USB doesn&#039;t not work.<br />Another function which I need is WDS.<br />I have as of today Linksys WRT-54GL and ASUS WL-500G.&nbsp; For some reason WDS works on one unit (tested with 3Com routers/Access Points) and doesn&#039;t work on another.</p><p>In terms of budget, Linksys WRT160NL costs here about $110.<br />Most expensive of TP-Link routers, TL-WN1043ND, has lower price.</p>									</div>
