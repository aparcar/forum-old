					<p>sorry, I assumed OpenWrt was as user friendly as DD-WRT and had a GUI.&nbsp; I know you guys must get tired of &quot;noobs&quot; breaking their routers and then pester the forum members to &quot;fix it&quot; but that&#039;s no excuse for being rude and acting like an elitist.</p>									</div>

					<div class="quotebox"><cite>maddes.b wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>A way to flash the stock firmware via sysupgrade is mentioned in <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=111363#p111363">post #905</a> of another thread. Just to let you know.</p></blockquote></div><p>Thanks (as usual) maddes for the link to a simpler process. The way I did it may still be useful for those like me who either didn&#039;t have a WAN connection anymore (it&#039;s funny how the wife and kids start yelling when I take down our home network :-) :-) ), or if it is in a bricked enough state that the WAN connection no longer is functional.</p><p>As a small update, I modded my WNR854T by removing the internal antennas and adding three rp-sma external antenna ports. Definitely improves the radio signal coverage. However, Netgear&#039;s firmware controlling the radio card just doesn&#039;t keep it consistent - the signal strength constantly changes, and it will do a drop all connections once every 24 to 48 hours. I think I need to try the latest openwrt beta firmware again.</p><p>maddes or nilfred - can you suggest the most stable version that includes wireless working that I should start with? That I sure will save me a couple of trial and change iterations.</p><p>Thanks again.</p>									</div>
