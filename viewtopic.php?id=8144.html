					<p>When trying to build kamikaze (for x86-platform) on an intel-based mac os ox, I get stucked with &quot;scripts/mod/mk_elfconfig.c:4:17: error: elf.h: No such file or directory&quot;. I allready found some tipps in the wild to copy or link a appropriate elf.h while building the uclibc toolchain. </p><p>Is it currently possible to build on intel-based macs? How to best solve above problem?</p><p>Thanks for your hints<br />Mathias</p>									</div>

					<p>I also though about using qemu instead. But mainly I would prefer compiling directly under mac os... currently I am using my debian box instead. In near future I would be nice to support intel-based macs.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mathias</strong> on 19 Nov 2006, 12:19)</p>

					<p>Buildroot&nbsp; has been developed for Linux. <br />Mac OS X is running UNIX (based on Free BSD )<br />I don&#039;t think you can expect to build kamikaze natively on a MAC. <br />Using VMWare and a Linux Guest system (say Ubuntu) is the easiest way. <br />Or you could build a dual-boot system and put a native linux on a partition</p>									</div>

In fact, it&#039;s one of the supported platforms for building OpenWrt.</p><p>I haven&#039;t built Kamikaze on OS X in a while, so things may be a little different now. Here&#039;s what I had to do: First, you need a case-sensitive file system to build OpenWrt, but the default file system on Macs isn&#039;t case-sensitive. The easy way around this problem is to use an appropriately formatted disk image or separate disk partition. You&#039;ll also need to install Xcode, which is available free from Apple. This will get you gcc and a few other development tools. You&#039;ll still need to install or upgrade a few more easily obtainable tools. When you try to build Kamikaze, it will tell you what&#039;s missing. In addition, you will need to get a new version of sed. Some of the scripts don&#039;t work with the version of sed included with OS X.</p>									</div>

					<p>Makes sense - there is no fundamental reason why a cross-compilation environment should have to depend on the capabilities of the host OS if it is designed right. <br /> It does look like there are multiple minor irritations to take care of in building it on a Mac OS-x. </p><p>See<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/2156">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/2156</a></p><p>So I wonder if it is worth the hassle - especially since VMWare Player is so easy to install and use.</p>									</div>

					<p>That ticket is almost two years old. Kamikaze 8.09 builds cleanly on OS X. (I just did it.)</p><p>VMware Player doesn&#039;t run on a Mac. It&#039;s for Windows and Linux only. There&#039;s VMware Fusion, but that costs money. In any case, I think the main reason to build natively is to avoid the overhead of having another OS running alongside OS X, or the nuisance of dual booting.</p><p>Anyway, it looks like the easiest thing to do is to install MacPorts, and use it to install the ports coreutils, findutils, gawk, getopt, wget, and md5sha1sum. I&#039;m not entirely certain sed is needed, but I installed the port gsed +with_default_names anyway.</p>									</div>
