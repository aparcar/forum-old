					<p>At the weekend I bought a Netgear WNDR3700 with the idea of replacing my old WRT54GL running DD-WRT. I live in Vancouver and have Shaw cable wired WAN and also want to plug in a Mobilicity USB internet stick (<a href="http://store.mobilicity.ca/product.asp?pf_id=93136N">http://store.mobilicity.ca/product.asp?pf_id=93136N</a>) for multi-WAN load balancing and redundancy in case the Shaw goes down. I have the WNDR3700 plugged in and working with the Shaw modem (has to call Shaw and get them to turn the SMC modem/router into a modem/bridge).</p><p>Next step is to get OpenWrt onto the WNDR3700. Where should I start reading? Can anybody kindly help me through this process by offering tips and links?</p>									</div>

					<p>Look into Arohk&#039;s build of OpenWRT for the 3700. I personally use custom build based of his original snapshot, and it has been working stably for some time now.</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27722">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27722</a></p>									</div>
