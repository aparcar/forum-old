					<p>I ran into the same problem and have a theory. Mount would not mount it but ntfs-3g would. Mount it with ntfs-3g then do a mount to check what file system is listed as. According to ntfs-3g documentation it should be ntfs-3g but mount would not take that file system. Doing a mount showed a filesystem other than ntfs-3g, it was fuseblahblah or something. Figure out what it lists as after mounting with ntfs-3g then try mounting it using that as the file system and see what happens. I haven&#039;t had time to do this with the samba3 issue i was working on. Let me know what happens!</p>									</div>

					<p>PS, I also read with mount that just doing mount /sda/sda1 /mnt/whatever or whatever you mount it as makes mount specify whatever it thinks are the best options and sometimes it will pick wonky options. That&#039;s why I came up with the theory that maybe specifying the file system listed with a mount command might fix the problem. Dunno but doesn&#039;t hurt to try?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,I&#039;m just Linux Looser, but i managed to compile trunk in such way, that i can see ntfs partition in LuCi MountPoints, i can read from it, but i can&#039;t write more than 2MB. Using ntfs-3q without FUSE.</p>									</div>
