					<p>So I&#039;m now a newbie with an up and working OpenWRT instance - so perhaps I can try to understand my network a bit better.</p><p>Virgin have indicated that I UPLOAD between 20-40Gb / day from my IP - which I frankly find unbelievable. Obviously Virgin are traffic shaping me quite heavily because of this. I&#039;ve put traffic meters (Networx) on my family desktop and laptop machines - and these don&#039;t seem to be showing me anything unusual (&lt;1Gb upload across all devices I can monitor)</p><p>So I suspect &quot;something else&quot; is going on, or some device that I can&#039;t monitor easily (satellite box is Linux,&nbsp; TV receiver is internet connect, phone and tablets!)&nbsp; is causing an issue (or Virgin is wrong of course!)</p><p>How can I use OpenWRT help me please - as I assume whatever is happening must be going through the router!<br />Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>A quick test is to look at Status -&gt; Realtime Graphs, then look at the traffic on your WAN interface. (You can learn whether this is eth0 or eth1 by looking at Network-&gt;Interfaces: look at the WAN box, and find the name.) </p><p>If you&#039;re really uploading 20-40 GBytes/day, you&#039;ll see appreciable traffic on the WAN interface. </p><p>(Also make sure that only your OpenWrt router is plugged into your Virgin modem...)</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi mate the simplest way to do this is to flash gargoyle it&#039;s baste on openwrt but with a different webinterface. It has all this kind of stuff built in.<br />Homepage:<br /><a href="https://www.gargoyle-router.com/index.php">https://www.gargoyle-router.com/index.php</a><br />Latest build:<br /><a href="https://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=10777">https://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/v â€¦ mp;t=10777</a><br />On the screen shots it looks dated but the latest build has a updated GUI. Gargoyle does not support as many routers as openwrt tho.</p>									</div>

					<p>And there is vnstat/luci-app-vnstat which will allow you to log the accumulative traffic on your WAN interface. Vnstat does not allow per device measurements, but if the accumulative traffic stays well below the 20-40GB/day that your ISP claims, you might not actually need per-device resolution. If the total is sufficiently close to the range the ISP claims, you probably still would like per device resolution. Maybe then running iftop on the router and just looking at which machines actually transfer data in real time might be a quick solution, that does not require switching to gargoyle (nothing against gargoyle, it might be what you want and need)</p>									</div>

					<p>That kind of traffic has to be very noticeable... go to the realtime graphs and disable devices one by one until you see the traffic dropping.</p>									</div>
