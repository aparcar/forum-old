					<p>I&#039;ve got two Netgear GS108Tv1 8-port gigabit switches sitting around, and after some digging, I discovered that the underlying hardware might be supported by OpenWRT.</p><p>Quick specs that I can discern:</p><ul><li><p>Broadcom BCM5836P cpu, ~264MHz</p></li><li><p>Broadcom BCM5398 8-port GbE Switch</p></li><li><p>16MB RAM</p></li><li><p>4MB Flash</p></li><li><p>Uses ~12W of power, max</p></li><li><p>OS is some eCos version</p></li><li><p>Bootloader appears to be CFE (judging by the contents of the STARTUP NVRAM var)</p></li></ul><p>So I opened it up, and there is a 6-pin header that looks like a serial port.&nbsp; Using a multimeter, I read 3.3V off of most of the pins, so I assume this to need a 3.3VTTL converter, which I bought.&nbsp; However, plugging the converter in, loading up Teraterm, and then powering up the switch yields no output (tried multiple bauds, etc).&nbsp; Everywhere I&#039;ve read suggests that CFE *always* has output of some kind, but I am left wondering if Netgear somehow disabled it in this device.</p><p>There are two HTTP servers in the firmware.&nbsp; One is the Broadcom &quot;loader&quot; firmware that only activates if the Netgear firmware can&#039;t boot, and I am unable to brick the thing in order to do so.&nbsp; Once you downgrade the flash to the older 1.x firmwares, you can access an eCos shell via Telnet, but even messing around with the &#039;nvram&#039; command, I cannot corrupt, delete, or alter the STARTUP var to brick the device.&nbsp; According to <a href="http://www.jebriggs.com/blog/2009/09/netgear-gs108t-smart-switch-notes/">this blog post</a>, it is possible to intentionally brick the thing, and I might be able to load an OpenWRT *.trx flash image onto it via the loader HTTP server.</p><p>The other HTTP server is the Netgear one that you normally manage the device with, and it does verification on any new firmware images being loaded, so you can&#039;t flash OpenWRT on that way, either.</p><p>I was able to compile an OpenWRT image that was only 3.7MB in size, which should be small enough to fit into the flash, using these settings:<br /></p><ul><li><p>Target System (Broadcom BCM47xx/53xx (MIPS))</p></li><li><p>Subtarget (Generic)</p></li><li><p>Target Profile (Broadcom SoC, all Ethernet, No WiFi)</p></li></ul><p>But until I can flash the image, I have no way of knowing if this will even work.</p><p>There does appear to be a 14-pin JTAG spot, but I&#039;ll have to hunt down a header for it, and then figure out how to actually talk to it (never done JTAG before), but that&#039;s my last-resort option.&nbsp; I am hoping someone else here has ideas on why the supposed serial header isn&#039;t working or knows of ways to nuke the Netgear eCos firmware so the Broadcom loader HTTP server comes up instead.</p><p>I&#039;ve uploaded two photos, one front, one back, of the circuit board, which might help explain the serial bit:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/gmQITtr.jpg" alt="Netgear GS108T Circuit Board Front" /></span></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/MuJdT5G.jpg" alt="Netgear GS108T Circuit Board Back" /></span></p><p>I am open to other things to try.&nbsp; Ideas?</p>									</div>
