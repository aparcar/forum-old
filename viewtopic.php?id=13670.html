					<p>Thank you ajauberg, I will try your approach but I think i&#039;ve allready done that but it didn&#039;t work. Can you also please post your /etc/config/wireless and /etc/config/network from the wrt54gl? I&#039;m interested in seeing what that looks like as I don&#039;t use x-wrt.</p><p>Cisien and Weedy: not an option as in that case I rely on a single access point which makes it a single point of failure and in case that access point goes down the broadcom router is lost. If I do wds at least I stand a chance of still being connected to a router with a much weaker signal that wouldn&#039;t be connected to if in client mode.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, there are no /etc/config/network or /etc/config/wireless files in Whiterussian, as it uses NVRAM settings instead.</p><p>My advice is to keep the WRT54GL running Whiterussian with the X-WRT web interface on it, it is _very_ easy to configure. There is no reason to run Kamikaze on this device in my opinion.</p>									</div>
