					<p>Hello,</p><p>this was my first time installing OpenWRT and everything was smooth from start to finish <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />But I am having one little problem...<br />When my internet connection is maxed out (when I am downloading something, for example), I get very high pings (1,5s) and the browsing is slugish but the download continues at the max. This happens on wired and wireless interfaces.</p><p>My speeds are 2Mb/s down and 600kb/s.<br />My router is one TL-WR941N. I tried googling and searching the forums but couldn&#039;t find anything...<br />What could be the problem? On the original firmware it worked as it should, this problem only happen with OpenWRT.<br />Is there something that I can do to help diagnose the problem?</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>EDIT:<br />I seem to have posted on the wrong forum... Could someone move it to the correct one, please? Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lagonauta</strong> on 8 Apr 2012, 03:26)</p>

					<p>Thanks, it seems to have worked <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />I had no more space left on my unit, so I compiled my own build and... now I can download and browse at the same time <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> (and now have 200KB left with all that I need, yay!)</p><p>But It seems that I need to have the exact speed written in the config file (or on LuCI), is there any way to make this automatic? Thanks again! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
