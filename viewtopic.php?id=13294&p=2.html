					<p>WTF is PulseAudio?</p><p>1. What a &quot;soundcard&quot; ultimately does, i.e. has to do, is to transform digital signals coming from inside the calculator into some analog signal and output this analog signal through some port. You can connect some simple loudspeakers to that port, and voila, SOUND.</p><p>2. The soundcard hardware is connected to the calculator via PCI/PCIe/USB/etc and needs some hardware drivers, to be able to be spoke to, by the system (kernel).</p><p>3.

					<p>Alsa is the whole shebang to control your soundcard. It has kernel components as well as the userspace counterparts. Alternatives to Alsa are OSS, Jack, etc.<br />Pulseaudio lays on top of Alsa to enable more features, for example to wrap around non-Alsa applications, provide better multi-session handling, bluetooth (A2DP) integration with the bluetooth stack Bluez and the ability to stream over the network (including multicast etc.). The latter is what I think is the most interesting feature for OpenWRT.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gertvdijk</strong> on 13 Jun 2011, 20:41)</p>

					<p>I dont quite get the advantage.</p><p>I have sounddata (=some mp3-file) on a harddisk on PC1. When I want to get this data to PC2, I can stream the mp3 itself, which is digital, or I could stream, the analog-data, which would come out of the 3,5mm audio-jack. Of course, I would have to transform this analog signal to some digital signal again, to transport it over Ethernet/WiFi.</p><p>In first case I&#039;d use nfs/samba and would need a soundcard on PC2. In the latter case, I would need a server on PC1 and a client on PC2. PC2 would not have to have a soundcard to do the dig2ana, but it would still have to have some 3,5mm jack to connect some loudspeakers to it.</p><p>So, I don&#039;t understand, why one use something else then nfs/samba/ftp&nbsp; to stream data.</p><br /><p>Localy, it probably give&#039;s you the possibility to mess with the digital stream before it get&#039;s transformed to analog, and allow you to do, what &quot;Audacity&quot; does, only in real time.

					<p>Come on. Pulseaudio exists for a reason. If you don&#039;t get it, just read the features.</p><p>Anyway, in short...<br />Because you&#039;ll have to decode everything on the box with the soundcard. And how about live streaming?

					<p>I appreciate you tryin&#039;, but my answer remains unanswered ;-)</p><p>What exactly does it (PulseAudio) stream, when it streams? mp3? it has to be digital and it should be compressed. The difference to nfs is simple the transport/transfer protocol. ?</p><br /><p>Edit: from what I understood, the advantage of PA over NFS is not really huge. You still need 2x Audio hardware+ drivers, and also, you have about the same amount of traffic.</p><p>Some&nbsp; differences are:<br />&nbsp; * you can use multicast with PA, you cannot with NFS<br />&nbsp; * you can manage the playlist on the server, you cannot with NFS<br />&nbsp; * in case you use OpenWrt-Box as client, and not as server, you probably have much more &quot;computing power&quot; for effects. Of course, not the other way around.</p><br /><p>Edit2: this simply means, PA is not 20 times better then NFS, it is simply different.</p><p>Some people were so excited about PA, that I got the impression this is now //THE// solution for everything sound based.&nbsp; ;-)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>scruffy</strong> on 13 Jun 2011, 17:36)</p>

					<p>According to this:&nbsp; <a href="http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Soundsystem#Routing">http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Soundsystem#Routing</a></p><p>The server, does not need sound hardware. It does need a player with a, e.g. mp3-decoder, this data goes to PA, and then this immediately is streamed over the network. But this means, it doesn&#039;t stream mp3.

					<p>r28044 seemed broken. Reported the issue in <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/9952">#9952</a> and I was lucky to get that fixed by a developer within hours.<br />So r28045 built successfully. Pulseaudio installs *a lot* easier nowadays. Almost no configuration is needed (except for networking) after installing using opkg and things just work. Great work by developers here. I did report two additional shortcomings: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/9955">#9955: &quot;pulseaudio-tools paplay assertion&quot;</a> and <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/9956">#9956: &quot;pulseaudio-tools depends on libdbus&quot;</a>.</p><p>However, my original issue still exists: a lot of sound cracks, noises and stutter. Will gather more information and sound recordings later. My gut feeling here says it&#039;s a simple buffer issue regarding the Bi-endianess architecture of this device or the OpenWrt patches for the smaller memory footprint. To get that clear I am building for x86 at the moment and using USB-passthrough in a VM.

					<p>Hi - thanks for helping<br />I&#039;m just in process of replacing the opkg downloaded pulse with a home-built one.<br />But I had checked that; the modules were all owned by root:root and readable by all.<br />By the way, I tried to load a different module: module-cli and it worked!&nbsp; I got a command line interface.<br />I then tried module-null-sink - it loaded, and module-loopback also loaded.<br />module-alsa-card, module-alsa-sink and module-udev-detect all failed to load with the same error.</p><p>It might be permissions on the sound devices /dev/snd/....<br />they are all root:root and readable only...</p><p>J</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi - </p><p>Just to confirm, the modules in /usr/lib/pulse-1.1/modules were all root:root rwxr-xr-x (they were 755 already)<br />I tried chown pulse:pulse * and re-ran - no change</p><p>I also tried chown pulse:pulse /dev/snd/* - again no change, still getting the &quot;Failed to open module ... file not found&quot; error on module-alsa-* and module-udev-detect...</p><p>any other permissions might be in play - anything to do with libtool loading?</p><p>J</p>									</div>
