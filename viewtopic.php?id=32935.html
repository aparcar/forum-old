					<p>hello,</p><p>ipv6restore is in PATH and is called flawlessly from terminal; I also used busybox with routertech, and is cron worked without problems calling functions in PATH with short path; in any case</p><p>changed /etc/crontabs/root in </p><p>*/4 * * * * /usr/sbin/ipv6restore</p><p>still no tracks of execution of cron in logread, but this morning the ipv6 tunnel was on after many hours, which is improbable if no signal is send in the tunnel - is it possible that cron is executed without traces in logread? The function ipv6restore send a ping6 in the tunnel to check its existence, and restore if no return.</p><p>THX</p>									</div>
