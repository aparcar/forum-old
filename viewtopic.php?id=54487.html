					<p>it would be nice to have more meaningful default names....like WAN instead of eth0.2, at least in terms of what shows up throughout Luci (e.g. real-time graphs)</p>									</div>

					<p>We use udev rules to rename network interfaces for consistency between models.&nbsp; Some drivers use the wwan convention, others show up as eth1 or usbN.&nbsp; We recently found that when renaming usb0 to wwan0 the connection between netifd events and the DHCP proto configuration may be broken.&nbsp; That is, on WAN up events the udhcpc is not executed.&nbsp; Does anyone know why this may happen?</p>									</div>
