					<p>Hello OpenWRT users !</p><p>I am thinking about releasing my simple Asterisk GUI for OpenWRT but would like to check first if there is any interest about it.</p><p>It is implemented as a collection of bash scripts, WebIf pages, agi (asterisk) script and JavaScript,<br />and include a complete and fully functional dialplan, which provides a fully functional and full featured asterisk system without having to edit any .conf file.</p><p>The asterisk configuration is stored in a uci file and read into asterisk Global vars by a script. The variables are used by the provided custom dialplan. Scripts write the configuration from the GUI to the asterisk config files. The interface is build into the Webif frame with a similar interface than the router configuration.</p><p>Have a look at the MARS Asterisk GUI (simulation) here:<br /><a href="http://teledata.qc.ca/MARS/WebInterface/asterisk-management.html">http://teledata.qc.ca/MARS/WebInterface â€¦ ement.html</a></p><p>Some exclusive features: WebCall, WebAudio, Cell to VoIP gateway, local prefix lookup.<br />Easily link up to four systems with an IAX link using the GUI.<br />Support up to 4 SIP / IAX / or FXO trunks and 8 extensions.</p><p>It also implement the usual asterisk features without the need to edit the config file.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; * Automated attendant. With user record able personalized menus.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Voice mail with email delivery of voice mail messages.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Bilingual (English / French (or other)) or unilingual (user configurable)&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * WebCall: Allows the visitors of your WWW site to request a call back. (Advantageously replace a 800 line).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Cell To VoIP gateway : Place long distance calls from your cell using your system&#039;s VoIP line.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Web Audio : Listen to hundreds of hours of high quality audio programs.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Queue (ACD): Manage the distribution of calls when all extensions are busy.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Music on Hold. When transferring calls or in the call queue.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Time Conditions : Allows to define the opening hours and direct the calls in consequence.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Automated call routing local / long distance according to you location.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Local prefix list automatically updated from the Internet for your location.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Call transfers (supervised or not (blind)) to another internal extension.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Call parking. Park a call and get it back from another extension.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Call forward unconditional&nbsp; : to another extension or even to an external number (cell ... )<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Call forward on busy, Do not disturb,&nbsp; Automated Attendant status, WebCall status etc. etc.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Etc. ...</p><p>So anyone interested ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Looks nice.<br />I would say release it anyway, although I prefer the cli version (not a fan of http on openwrt).<br />BTW, do you have a multilanguage setup? What do you mean by &quot;unilingual (user configurable)&quot;</p><p>Can a caller pick his native tongue when they call the system?</p><p>cheers</p>									</div>

					<p>Marvelous! Asterisk GUI for openwrt is a great news.</p><p>Although I don&#039;t understand why there is a limit on the number of trunks and extensions. It&#039;s just a predefined .conf thing maybe?</p><p>didn&#039;t know there is a openwrt-able device that supports FXO trunk.<br />Based on which version of asterisk? 1.4 or 1.6?</p>									</div>

					<p>The limit is due to the fact that this was indented to be used on &#039;low power&#039; <br />router like the ASUS WL-500Gp or the Linksys WRTSL54GS but it could easily be extended.<br />The current implementation assume there is some external storage (USM mem stick or other)<br />where the prompts, voicemail and CDR are stored.</p><p>There is a menu to select the language so it could be adapted to any language with a simple <br />modification.</p><p>It is built on Kamikaze 7.x so it uses the older version of UCI. I haven&#039;t installed 8.x yet ...<br />Is LuCi much different ?</p><p>It is based on Asterisk 1.4x <br />It can use &#039;external&#039; SIP FXO adapters like the Linksys SPA3102 (1 FXO/1 FXS) and presumably others.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>noelbou</strong> on 16 Apr 2009, 21:51)</p>

					<p>I think quite some work has been done on a LuCi interface already.<br />But having different GUI options is a good thing.</p><p>Hans.</p>									</div>

					<p>It is great to see how are you implement it. If you want a simple one, try FIVN Asterisk GUI <a href="http://www.fivn.com/products/asterisk.html">http://www.fivn.com/products/asterisk.html</a> . It is written in shell script for Openwrt, DD-WRT, NSLU2 and other Linux.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nguyen</strong> on 1 Jun 2009, 16:04)</p>
