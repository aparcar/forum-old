The Pogoplug&#039;s stock firmware tries to boot from SATA first anyway before falling back to NAND. <a href="https://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=55&amp;t=2146">There is an older thread over at the Arch Linux ARM forums</a> that describes what the disk layout should look like (best to read the thread back to front, the original method from the first posts in the thread is quite outdated it seems). It would be funny to try switching up their method with OpenWrt files, though I&#039;m very much lacking the time to do it right now.</p><p>USB booting is a different story. You would have to use a 2nd-stage uboot loaded by the original uboot (that&#039;s not very competent in doing much else). I don&#039;t know if you could squeeze it in between original uboot and original firmware, but I believe the Arch Linux guys did just that.</p><p>(Personally, I never cared for the original firmware in the first place since I have other -- equally low-cost but much more suitable -- devices to use as NAS boxen. And was equally uninterested in Arch Linux. I installed OpenWrt directly on NAND, buh-bye original firmware ...)</p><p>Edit: Oops, linked the wrong thread in the first paragraph.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 15 Apr 2016, 00:33)</p>

So far, I have only replaced the stock uboot with a 3rd party uboot on one unit which is now capable of booting from original stock firmware found on the internal NAND storage, or booting from firmware/OS found on any external storage, i.e. USB and/or SATA. If both USB and SATA storage contain a firmware/OS, my PogoPlug Pro 02 will boot off of the firmware/OS on the USB partition.</p>									</div>
