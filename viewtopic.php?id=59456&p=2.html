					<p>@theincogtion - i was suggesting you take the WAN port of the NEXX and connect it to your laptop (Client) and also have the LAN port of the NEXX connected to the LAN port of the router.&nbsp; As your NEXX LAN port appears to act as a WAN port, this would confirm that the two ports are reversed in the software.</p><p>@frietpan - can you confirm or deny that the LAN and WAN ports are reversed relative to the case markings as theincogtion indicates</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>RangerZ</strong> on 16 Sep 2015, 01:32)</p>

					<p>@RangerZ<br />Are you sure?

					<p>OK, so the NEXX lan port is connected by cable to your client PC and shows the LAN address of 192.168.1.1.&nbsp; That means the NEXX is running DHCP on the LAN side correctly.&nbsp; As frietpan also says that this is the LAN port, I think this is correct and working.</p><p>So now your wifi screen shows two connections, the master is wireless to the PC.&nbsp; The other, based upon the IP info at the bottom of the above post is the WAN connection to your home router using the second connection on radio0 and it should say client.&nbsp; The IP info indicates that you have the WWAN connection to the home router working.&nbsp; You should be able to go to the internet.</p><p>I think we have validated what connection is what.&nbsp; the only other thing I can suggest is to go to the WAN interface and make sure that the current wireless and the eth0.2 are bridged (check box at top on and the wireless and ethernet both checked).&nbsp; If not please do so.</p><p>If you now DISABLE the wireless connection for the WAN side and connect a cable, if it works great, if not I would say the port is dead.</p>									</div>
