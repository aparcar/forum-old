					<p>I need some help , i have wrt1900ac V1 , yesterday flashed 15.05.1 official and begin playing with settings , i read all evening (and night) and cannot make txpower to work , i read that i need change country with another that have less restriction on power level and channel , i try to change from Luci and with uci command but without success .Maybe 15.05.1 come with new driver that have some restriction inside .. or maybe some patch to apply .. i understand that this theme is sensitive and if somebody may help let`s send me PM with more info .. otherwise i may try old 15.05 , i read and watch video that change country help .. i`m wondering that not only increase power , but and decrease don`t work , also if i select channel that not allowed in my region router just dont transmit on it .. so i believe that txpower , country and channel dont work with parameter different than factory default .. again i know that FCC and ETSI watching under microscope openwrt and to stay legal open source firmware need to follow rules .Thanks in advance</p>									</div>

					<p>You are trying to decrease the power from the default setting of max power (20dBm? At least that is what it is on my devices)?</p><p>You say it did not work, but what did not work? The menu, saving the value, tests of the power taken with external test equipment? What region? Please explain clearly.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for reply first .. I try increase and decrease power level from default 20 dBm to see that command works . Menu on Luci works great , after changing country from DE to NZ appears power level up to 30 dBm , also on 5 GHz appears upper channel 149 - 165 , when save and apply , even after reboots settings are saved . i try also SSH and command line &quot;iw get reg &quot; and region was changed to NZ , then i read power level and was 30 dBm , but really signal was the same level on workstation in next room (approx. 10 meters and 1 wall between router and PC) , exactly same when i set 30 dbm , 20 dbm and 10 dbm .. power is the same as oem firmware .. also i try set channel 149 , all seem working but signal is gone , when i try lets say channel 100 signal appears (after 60 sec DFS offcourse).. i believe something cap with EU settings that not allowed above 20 dbm and channel that not in use in EU (in fact these upper channel are already allowed in EU but with SRD low power - 25 mW) strange that even lower power , i.e. 10 dBm also not working .. after couple of hours googling and reading i think that is something in a mwlwifi driver or in dts settings .. or maybe in eeprom .. i need some help for this</p>									</div>

					<p>Wow, can that device actually handle 30dBm? I haven&#039;t seen the technical specs for it.</p><p>All my devices, or at least their drivers only support 802.11a/g at 2.4gHz, so I can&#039;t really test anything. But I generally have not had the need to change the power for use within my apartment. I also only stick with my country settings.</p><p>Are you just experimenting or is there some need to go outside of your countries regulations?</p>									</div>

					<p><strong>@JW0914</strong></p><p>&nbsp; Thanks for advice , i know many ways to &quot;solve&quot; my problem , but not as effective as little increase tx power , for this reason i keep my old WRT54 with white russian 0.9 .. old but gold .. i know that ethernet is way more effective , also i may install 2-3 router on opposite end in house but many devices many headaches . <br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; I know that 5 ghz attenuate more than 2.4 ghz because short wavelenght ,but 5 ghz in my area is practically unused and if i can increase power will work pretty good and this not interference my neighborhood because too many other channel is free .. also i have amateur radio license and i have right to transmit on all amateur frequency .. that include 2300-2450 MHz and 5650-5850 MHz , there are some of wifi channels..</p><p>&nbsp; I just want to know how openwrt works , how i can control power , frequency and some other parameters .. i know what i do , just want to try and see if this work for me .. and if this info is &quot;confidencial&quot; please somebody that have info please write me few words with some advice on e-mail privately ..</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s unlikely you&#039;ll be able to garnish a better 5gHz signal even with increasing power to 30db (1W) if there&#039;s a concrete wall in between you and the router.&nbsp; It&#039;s simply physics, as the 5gHz wavelength literally hits a wall and cannot penetrate concrete (electromagnetic radiation literally reflects off concrete [same occurs with ceramic, metal, and obviously mirrors]).&nbsp; This exact subject was discussed a few months back in the WRT1900AC thread, as another member was also having issues who was also trying to access the 5gHz network through concrete.&nbsp; (Unfortunately the forum doesn&#039;t yet support thread search, as being able to read that conversation would be helpful to you)</p><p>Try configuring with 30dB tx power and a Distance Optimization of 50... if that doesn&#039;t result with a signal, you&#039;re simply not going to get one.&nbsp; Also, I believe you have to set a specific channel (i.e. not Auto) for tx power to come into play (I could very well be wrong however, as I may be misremembering another conversation in the WRT1900AC thread)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>JW0914</strong> on 22 May 2016, 05:34)</p>
