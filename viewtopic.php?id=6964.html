					<p>I am trying to use <a href="http://dav.sourceforge.net/">davfs 1.0.2</a> on my WRT54G router, however, it requires kernel support for coda.o. I have tried using the coda module from <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=31008">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=31008</a>, but it does not work, when mount.davfs tries to open the coda device, it recieves a No such device...No free coda device to mount error.</p><p>This is probably due to the fact that my router runs whiterussian and the coda.o above is built for kamikaze. I am currently attempting to compile it, but it looks like a very long and painful process, so I&#039;d appreciate it if somebody could compile/have already compiled a copy of coda.o for whiterussian (preferably with assurances that davfs works with it) that could be sent to me. If the compilation/struggling finishes first, I&#039;ll post here in case there is somebody else looking to do this.</p><p>Thanks, nandhp</p>									</div>
