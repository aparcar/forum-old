					<p>I&#039;ve noticed some people are running Slimserver (or Squeezebox, as it&#039;s now called) on OpenWRT.&nbsp; I&#039;m doing something different.&nbsp; I have a Squeezebox that is on my screen porch and I want it connected via ethernet instead of wifi for various reasons.&nbsp; That means, basically, an unsecured ethernet connection to my LAN outside of my direct control.</p><p>To solve that problem, I have a Linksys WRTSL54GS.&nbsp; The LAN side is, of course, connected to my LAN, which is in the 172.16.7.xxx range.&nbsp; The WAN side is connected to my Squeezebox.&nbsp; I&#039;ve set the firewall to forward ports 9000 and 3483 coming in on the WAN to the box on my LAN that runs Squeezecetner.</p><p>At first I tried this with the LAN side having the address 172.16.7.101 and the WAN and the Squeezebox were in the 192.168.1.xxx range.&nbsp; Right now I&#039;ve got the WAN and Squeezebox in the 10.0.0.xxx range.&nbsp; I&#039;ve told the Squeezebox the default gateway is 10.0.0.101, which is the WAN ip address.&nbsp; I&#039;ve set the firewall to forward anything with the destination IP as 172.16.7.2 (my Squeezecenter host) to that address on the LAN side.&nbsp; (I figure later, when I get it working, I&#039;ll forward only the ports Squeezecener needs.)</p><p>While I don&#039;t think this is related, on my LAN the default gateway is 172.16.7.1, which is the firewall (running pfSense).</p><p>I&#039;m no expert, but I&#039;ve used web interfaces to set up port forwarding before, for example, to allow someone outside my LAN to make a connection to my VNC listener on my my computer in my LAN.&nbsp; That&#039;s always worked just fine.</p><p>For some reason, though, no matter what I try, my Squeezebox on the WAN side of the router cannot detect the Sqeezecenter program in the LAN side, even with all the forwarding set up.</p><p>My understanding is that I can restrict and control what comes in through the WAN but don&#039;t really have control over what comes in through the LAN side, so as I understand it, this should work without a problem.</p><p>I&#039;ve considered it possible that when the packets pass through the firewall, going to the LAN, that there&#039;s no NAT, so when my Squeezecenter computer tries to reply, the packets are going to the LAN gateway (at 172.16.7.1) instead of being returned to the router at 172.16.7.101.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know enough, though, to have any way to check it out.</p><p>What do I need to change if I want the Squeezebox on the WAN side to communicate with Squeezecenter on 172.16.7.2 on the LAN side?</p><p>I&#039;ve included the output from &quot;iptables -L&quot; below.&nbsp; The computer &quot;ozma.thresh.oz&quot; is the one I&#039;m forwarding to at 172.16.7.2 (don&#039;t ask -- the name&#039;s a long story involving a young relative who likes the Oz books).</p><p>Thanks for any help on this!</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------<br />IPTables Output:</p><p>Chain INPUT (policy DROP)<br />target&nbsp;

					<p>Well, after the volumes of suggestions that poured in, and after 2 1/2 days of going over this, forwarding the output of &quot;iptables -L&quot; to a friend who specializes in firewalls and trying to figure this out, I tried Kamikaze.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t want to at first because the page on this device suggested White Russian and said NOTHING about trying Kamikaze.&nbsp; Since I&#039;m no expert on embedded devices and didn&#039;t want to brick a route, I was reluctant to try it, but finally felt there was no other solution.&nbsp; (Actually, I reflashed with White Russian, but for some reason, even though I used the same .bin file I used before, the web interface didn&#039;t allow control over firewalls -- and I don&#039;t know which package would have added it, tried searching but didn&#039;t want to go through a huge number of packages to find out.)</p><p>I wasn&#039;t able to set the firewall filters as finely as I wanted to, but I was able to get it working under Kamikaze.</p>									</div>
