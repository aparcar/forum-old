					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have been searching for a solution for a long time and I think a openwrt router could be the solution.</p><p>I am looking for the following </p><p>3G/4G failover and failback internet backup wait there is more</p><p>I would like it to work with freedompops devices because I would use freedompop as a almost free backup internet</p><p>I would like it to be a cheap solution, I know I can buy a cradlepoint router for $300-$400 but I would like this to be a $100-$150 solution.</p><p>I would love for it to email me a alert when the internet is running on 3g and how much data is used and when it switches back.</p><p>I know I might be asking a lot but can anyone recommend a hardware solution for this? I would prefer to buy this pre-flashed for the sake of time and simplicity.</p><p>I think some of the TPlink routers could be good candidates with USB ports? </p><p>I could possibly use a ubiquity edge router with a WIFI game adaptor in WAN 2 and a Freedompop hotspot. but I would like to keep this with as few moving parts as necessary.</p><p>freedom pop does offer SIM only solutions so a USB unlocked dongle could be&nbsp; a candidate. Has anyone had luck with these?</p><br /><p>Thanks in advance for all suggestions</p>									</div>

					<p>OfModemsAndMen.com port &quot;Rooter&quot; might provide bullet #1 on your list as a start or at leas better than you have now.&nbsp; &nbsp;Software is free and runs on a $7 A5-V11 router, so that&#039;s a $7 US investment to get you started.&nbsp; &nbsp;You&#039;ll likely need more storage to dink around with scripts to accomplish some of the other magic, so the 8M routers start around $25 US.</p><p><a href="http://ofmodemsandmen.com/documentation.html">http://ofmodemsandmen.com/documentation.html</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Does it do the fail-safe switch-overs and provide a platform for coding scripts for emails with fall-over etc?&nbsp; Having access to the base software would at least allow such possibilities that the poster was looking for.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also if you travel a lot as I do, it&#039;s hard to find a universal SIM device that speaks all the local country protocols.&nbsp; &nbsp;In many instances, you&#039;re stuck with buying the proprietary modem they offer that&#039;s unique to their customer set.</p><p>Otherwise, as technologies drop like flies, it&#039;s easier to replace a cheap USB modem than the whole setup.&nbsp; And if this company is anything like Cradlepoint, they will discover that continuing to support old equipment with firmware updates is not lucrative enough to support their marketing strategy, which is to sell you a new device every couple of years.</p>									</div>
