					<p>Hey all, have been following this thread for a couple of weeks now. I was able to build an image successfully (greater than 4MB too) but not able to flash via WebUI.

					<p>I diffed the TP-RE450 and master branches of radekdostals git to look through the modifications. Then applied this patch to the up-to-date LEDE git. Compiled including luci, and flashed two brand-new TP-RE450 without any problems. Running 7 and 15 days now. Connects at Tx rate up to 1300. <br />One minor bug I came across: ntpd requires numeric IP addresses.<br />A cron job turns the leds off at night :-)</p>									</div>
