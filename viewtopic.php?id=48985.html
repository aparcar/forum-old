					<p>Hi all,</p><p>unfortunately I have not only hardware revisions 1.1 and 1.2, so WiFi gets unstable with several Clients (5-10) after one to four days. My SqueezeBoxen simply lose connection, one after the other. In <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr3600">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr3600</a> I read that I either have to install Barrier Breaker or an Attitude Adjustment with a &quot;wifi patch&quot;.</p><p>What&#039;s that wifi patch? Where is it? Are there binary builds with that patach applied?</p>									</div>

Enabling it wouldve done the trick for you.</p><p>@OP why altitudea adjustment ? why don&#039;t you just use barrier breaker instead ? It runs flawlessly on my wdr3600 with all the heavy stuff loaded ( openvpn, pptpd, samba, ftp, multiwan, proxy, transmission, minidlna etc..) without ever needing a manual reboot..</p>									</div>

I am using Wifidog+ multiple SSID + BATMAN-adv + sshtunnel + syslog + tinyproxy in my application . was not sure that this system will work after upgrading to BB.
