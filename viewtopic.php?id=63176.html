					<p>Hello.</p><p>After I was unable to use 15.05 (whit wifi) on my WRT54GL, I decided that I will give it a try with barrier breaker.<br />This is (by my information) last known version of OpenWrt that works good with WiFi.<br />However I have troubles with image builder - to be more specific with make command.<br />First thing I spotted is that builder is made for 32bit system and I&#039;m running 64bit debian system. Can this be the problem? I really think it can&#039;t be, but there is always a chance it is <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I was searching web for solution and come across some fix tip which suggested adding space in line 19 after shell.sh word. but this fix did not help me, all it does is I don&#039;t have errors showing anymore and nothing is really happening.<br />Well, time to show an error I got:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>$ make info

Is it possible to achieve this?</p><p>Any help is really appreciated.</p>									</div>
