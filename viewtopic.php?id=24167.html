					<p>Hey all,</p><p>First of all, hats off to the great work on getting linux/openwrt support for the routerboard 450G hardware. I have been trying to get to run openwrt and another flavour of linux on the device, however I am getting weird issues when booting the device from onboard nand, which I have not seen reported in the other threads on the 450G:</p><p>I am using an self-contained openwrt (initramfs) for the moment; booting this os from network seems to work fine (I didn&#039;t extensively test everything, but I am able to execute commands in openwrt, transfer files from/to the device, etc). I applied the patch to increase the size of the kernel &quot;partition&quot;, and am then able to put the (~6M) image onto the flash, called &quot;kernel&quot;. Unmount, sync, done. </p><p>However, booting from this device is unreliable. Sometimes it works, sometimes it stops working after a cold reboot. Error messages vary from the boot loader indicating that the kernel is not an ELF header, to the kernel booting up but stating that there is junk in the compressed archive packed onto the kernel. If I boot from network again and do an md5sum on the image, the md5sum is still the same as the md5sum of the kernel booted from network (i.e. the file on disk is not corrupted). </p><p>On a maybe related sidenote, I get various buffer i/o errors on mtdblock0 and mtdblock1 on boot, when booting the device from network.</p><p>Any ideas what might be the problem here? Does the size of the flash partitions have to correspond with what the bootloader expects them to be? Any hints on what I can do to troubleshoot this issue?</p><p>Thanks in advanced and greetings from .nl,<br />--<br />Rien</p>									</div>
