					<p>I made a custom build Openwrt (barrier breaker) with Openflow 1.3 and I could connect it to ryo simple_switch_13 controller in outofband mode. port 3 and 4 of Ehternet are set as openflow ports but when I connect a device to these ports it won&#039;t get IP address from the access point! (not even 169.x) what is the problem here? openflow seems to be ok and these ports work normally when they are not ofports. Please give some hints. <br />Config files are : <br />--------------------------<br />/etc/config/network<br />--------------------------<br />config switch &#039;eth0&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
