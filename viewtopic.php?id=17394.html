					<p>Does anyone knows if it possible to have the Wireless Interface available ?</p><p>I&#039;ve read the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Asus/WL500GPV2">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har â€¦ /WL500GPV2</a> and built an image&nbsp; but I don&#039;t get the WIFI and the Documentation says : &quot;Do not be tempted to mess with wireless, yet. Here be dragons. &quot;</p><p>So it looks like it does not support wireless on it. </p><p>Is anyone working in wireless support ? Or is there another compatible device that I can use the same patches to get the WL500G Premium V2 to have wireless working ?</p>									</div>
