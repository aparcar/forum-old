					<p>for the WRT3200ACM I just don&#039;t know what to make of the following statement. <br />&quot;DFS Certified with Dedicated Scanner Radio<br />The WRT3200ACM operates in a clear airspace denied to traditional routers thanks to Dynamic frequency selection (DFS) certification from the FCC. This certification makes Tri-Stream 160 possible, and also triples the number of channels available at 80MHz. A dedicated DFS scanning radio keeps watch to prevent interference with airport weather radar, allowing the WRT3200ACM to maintain maximum speeds on the 5GHz band.&quot;</p><p>Considering the 1900ac won&#039;t stay on any 1 particular DFS channel any more than a few hours, and it doesn&#039;t matter if you are 200 miles away from the closest airport. Maybe they are using different firmware? Because people are going to be really disappointed otherwise.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>@jw0914, @zenbarguy: thanks for your reply. I have installed CC 15.05.1 (WRT1900acs with a V2 in label, V1 in firmware) and is in observation. Currently I have only 2.4ghz wireless enabled and a pc running some torrents. Just for tests.</p><p>What I really want to debug is why I have a lot of UDP connections to ISP dns server using transmission bittorrent client. Anyway to catch the problem? I mean.... how to know which problem specifically is and how mitigate, using openwrt, doing some analysis in packets maybe... because with transmission with almost 200 connections with my old wrt54gl without firewall my ISP don&#039;t disconnect me after some minutes, currently transmission client have 80 connections max and praying to not disconnect me. Graphs in OpenWRT show sometimes almost 300 connections, most of them are UDP to ISP dns server, if keeping raising connections my ISP disconnect me.</p><p>this are my graphs:<br />paste.opensuse.org/54524462<br />paste.opensuse.org/2586785</p><p>Thanks in advance <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>@feathersanddown</p><p>Based on the information you provided, UDP, DNS and your connection screenshot, it looks like it&#039;s all DNS queries(udp port 53).&nbsp; I have never used Transmission but just guessing the router is trying to &quot;lookup&quot; the DNS names possibly for clients connecting to you?&nbsp; Why... Heck if I know.</p><p>just a guess</p>									</div>
