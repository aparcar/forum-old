					<p>I hope that someone here will be able to help me. I am building somewhat of a captive portal but I am not sure how to approach it. </p><p>Outline<br />The router which I believe should have the captive portal will not require the wireless users to login to access the internet however I would like an option so that the wireless user can download an app for a mobile device. The router administrator would need to provide a username and password which is then logged into a remote server.</p><p>Is this something that can be done with and if so could someone point me to some information on how I might go about doing it.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
