					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I am using TP-Link TL-WR703N with latest openwrt (25-May-2013&nbsp; version openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr703n-v1-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin)</p><br /><p>Before the flash, the TP-Link firmware could PPPoE dialup, wifi and everything works fine.&nbsp; Here&#039;s the network:</p><p>computers, pads, mobile devices -&gt; WIFI (192.168.1.X) -&gt; WR703N(TP-Link firmware) -&gt; PPPoE -&gt; wired ethernet -&gt; ADSL modem (192.168.1.1) -&gt; telephone cable</p><p>The ADSL modem provided by the ISP already acts like a router, it has DHCP and everything. It has a telephone wire port and two eth ports, one for my own WR703N router/AP and another for IPTV.</p><p>TP-Link setup its own 192.168.1.x network and I can not access the ADSL modem (192.168.1.1), which is fine. Since The WR703N dialup with PPPoE directly to access the Internet.</p><p>But I had serious problem after flashed WR703N with OpenWRT.</p><p>Here&#039;s the steps I tried:</p><p>Use a ethernet cable connect WR703N and a Win7 computer (192.168.1.3), flash OpenWRT ROM, telnet to 192.168.1.1 and it works.</p><p>Edit /etc/config/wireless, add open AP, works. Edit /etc/config/network, add a PPPoE, and /etc/init.d/network restart, saw PPPoE discovery packets on Wireshark.</p><p>here are the config</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># cat /etc/config/network

Now disconnect the ethernet cable and connect WR703N to the ADSL modem with the eth cable.</p><p>And suddenly, I lost connection to OpenWRT, instead, the 192.168.1.1 turned out to be ADSL modem the ISP provided. Apperently OpenWRT acts like a switch, which is different from TPLink stock firmware. And the PPPoE dialup never works</p><p>I tried to allocate OpenWRT to a different C network like 192.168.0.X or 192.168.2.X, so I can access both ADSL modem and the WR703N OpenWRT, the wifi works fine, but the PPPoE fails. LuCI shows zero bytes in both TX and RX</p><p>I try to follow every tutorial I could find on the internet as well as openwrt community wiki but still fails to setup. My best guess is I need to setup some kind of VLAN to prevent the ADSL modem from DHCP through.</p><p>So can anybody tell me what went wrong and how do I fix this?</p><br /><p>Thanks in advance!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>est</strong> on 27 May 2013, 16:45)</p>

					<p>Two questions: doesnt the modem dial the connection for you? You say it has dhcp. Why not just connect the tp-link as a dhcp client to it?

					<p>Yes the whole setup looks bit odd.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>doesnt the modem dial the connection for you?&nbsp; You say it has dhcp.</p></blockquote></div><p>Yes the modem has dhcp, 192.168.1.1 opens the modem web interface. But it does not provide PPPoE. The 192.168.1.x address can only access the modem.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Why not just connect the tp-link as a dhcp client to it? (Set dmz in the modem on tp link router)</p></blockquote></div><p>The modem is locked by the ISP so I can&#039;t touch anything. Besides it&#039;s PPPoE you don&#039;t need DMZ to dialup. AFAIK PPPoE works on ethernet level regardless of IP level protocols.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Why are you using the two on the same subnet?</p></blockquote></div><p>I tried two subnets, still the PPPoE dialup fails. The ISP&#039;s modem seems to take out the whole DHCP, OpenWRT&#039;s DHCP didn&#039;t work at all.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Edit: or are you trying to have your modem in bridge mode?</p></blockquote></div><p>No, I don&#039;t have admin access to the ISP&#039;s modem.</p><p>The ISP modem is supposed to work for a single PPPoE client, you connect your PC to the modem with a wire, PPPoE dialup in Windows.</p><p>Now I need a way to dialup PPPoE using TL-WR703N w/ OpenWRT. The stock TP-Link firmware works in this way, but OpenWRT fails.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>est</strong> on 15 Jul 2013, 08:37)</p>
