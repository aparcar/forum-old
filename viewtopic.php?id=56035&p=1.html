					<p>I am not familular with the 941, I prefer the squashfs bins myself. Basically just use what ever you used before only&nbsp; make sure its from the Attitude adjustment repo and as long as openwrt is already on the device use the sysupgrade instead of the larger factory bins. As you can see the AA sysupgrade bin is 2.8mb and the BB is 3.2mb. That will give you more then enough space to add luci or the packages needed for extroot.</p>									</div>

					<p>make sure your version of the tl-wr941 is supported by AA before trying to install it. v6 needs at least BB. <br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr941nd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr941nd</a></p><p>LUCI is included in prebuild stable versions (also in BB), only the trunk-snapshots are without webinterface.<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ar71xx/generic/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_br … x/generic/</a><br />and there should be about half a MB left for your config files. <br />From my experience I would recommend BB if possible, e.g. the stability of ath9k (wifi-driver) has improved a lot compared to AA. </p><p>But I agree with mk24 if you need additional packages put them in the firmwareimage instead of installing them afterwards. <br />4MB are really not very much space</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 2 Mar 2015, 10:34)</p>

					<p>What image did you use ? AA should work just fine on the v3&#039;s. To recovery using failsafe method you will need to set your network up static to reach the router in failsafe mode.

					<p>ok, so you need to use ssh instead of telenet. Once you set the root password in openwrt telenet is disabled except in failsafe mode. So really you just have to use ssh instead of telenet. If you are using putty then just select the ssh radio button instead of telenet, if your using a terminal in linux then just ssh root@192.168.1.1, when prompted enter the password you set. You do not need your computer set up static to use ssh either so you can switch it back to normal(dhcp).Seems like your relatively new to openwrt(no offense) so i would suggest you use a wired connection and then install luci manually to get the web ui to assist you in set up. </p><p>First update the opkg list ...<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>opkg update</code></pre></div><p>then <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>opkg install luci</code></pre></div><p>once luci is installed log in as usual</p><p>Make sure you are not in failsafe mode, just reset the router and let it boot normally(led should remain on after boot) , then use ssh to access it</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hostle19</strong> on 2 Mar 2015, 19:05)</p>

					<p>nope I don&#039;t think none the less of you, I have been working with openwrt for years and from experience i can tell you that each recovery can be quite unique. </p><p>lstart with the basics..</p><p>1. make sure the ip has not been changed ? <br />- open up cmd prompt and type ipconfig /all and check for default gateway:<br />* this should not matter when using safe mode anyway..</p><p>2. make sure the router is the only device connected to the computer, turn off wireless </p><p>3. make sure cable is hooked from computer to the a lan port (1-4) on the router</p><p>4. set computer up for static ip:192.168.1.11, subnet:255.255.255.0, gateway:192.168.1.1 as before</p><p>5. reboot router in safemode and use telenet in putty with address 192.168.1.1</p><br /><p>if you still can not access the router then you may need to recover with via serial port which will require a ttl converter and some soldering skills</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hostle19</strong> on 2 Mar 2015, 20:48)</p>
