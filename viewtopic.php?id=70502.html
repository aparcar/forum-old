					<p>hello,</p><p>I have installed OpenWrt on my WDR3600 since years and it worked perfect.<br />Now I want to host a webpage on my homeserver. The Webserver (Apache2) is listen to port 80.<br />lucy on OpenWrt was listen to port 80 to. So I changed the port for lucy to 88 in the UHTTPD-file</p><p>So now lucy is listen to port 88. But wenn try to reach my webserver I get the following error:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>The requested URL /cgi-bin/luci was not found on Server</code></pre></div><p>this error comes from my apace2 webserver but why there is still /cgi-bin/lucy... how can I change this?</p><p>thanks in advance</p>									</div>

					<p>My first idea here is, you did _not_ try to access luci from your browser using URL:88, so apache picked up the request.</p>									</div>
