					<p>Hello Miguel, MBS just gave you good answers on your questions. You find generic pre-compiled images of every release including trunk. Just start off with the RC5 to play safe. The factory squashfs image can be flashed user-friendly through the stock web-interface of the router. You can do a power recycle in advance to free ram on the device. RC4, RC5 and trunk images will install fine. Avoid anything older, there are some nasty bugs for this device on older images.</p><p>Cross compilation is transparent on OpenWrt, just use a Debian based distro (e.g., Debian itself or Ubuntu with it&#039;s derivatives), and you will find directions on the wiki (i.e., through the link I provided) as to which packages you need. There is really nothing to it. Just play around with the pre-compiled image first, then you will also learn what packages you would want to compile in.</p><p>Good luck!</p><p>Has anybody else experienced unstable wireless connection during torrent traffic on clients?

					<p>neivel, your problem has probably little or nothing to do with the router. Hence, I suggest you start a new thread.</p><p>I haven&#039;t used client mode since White Russian, so I do not remember how the networking is set up. From what you are saying dhcp is handled by the other router (i.e., your openwrt router works as a simple switch), which sounds like a good default solution to me. It seems you want your openwrt router to do dhcp with it&#039;s own lan. Then as a minimum you will also need to have nat set-up. You probably want to mimic the network set-up of the wan port for the wireless connection.</p>									</div>

					<p>Interesting. How about the wireless, is the disconnecting gone? Would be helpful if anybody can confirm the same behaviour on stock firmware. I will get hold of another unit over the week-end, so I can test with that one before the stock firmware is nuked. I never had this issue with my old white russian wrt54gl, but then again my lines were slower at the time. I guess I can test with the old wrt54gl too to see if it can take the torrent traffic without hick-ups. On vacation right now though, so it will have to wait a week. Please keep us updated on your progress.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi all, thanks for the hints,</p><p>MBS what i meant is my usb flash comes with one FAT partition (sda1) what i wanted to avoid is creating a sda2 partition on the usb flash<br />i wanted a &quot;swapfile&quot;, like /dev/sda1/tl-1043.swp, a file already in the sda1 partition to be used for swap.</p><p>i already created the swap partition (128) mb on the usb and transmission seems more responsive than without the swap.</p><p>hey del, how that extra install space works? is it necesary to create a special filesystem in the usb for using it to install extra stuff?</p><p>what i mean is this usb flash most have FAT filesystem so i can unplugit and take it with me and readit everywhere i need, since if i am home i can just read it with samba.</p><p>best regards,<br />have a nice weekend.</p>									</div>

					<p>That&#039;s been pretty much what I wanted to point out: for the kernel it does not matter if you give it a partition or a file inside a filesystem. It treats both as a file (may it be called /dev/sda2 for a partition or /mnt/swap for a file).<br />Like Del mentioned, you can have your root filesystem on an usb drive. Information are in the wiki: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/extroot">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/extroot</a><br />But FAT is probably no good choice, since it lacks user permission attributes. One option is to create a (ext2/3/4)filesystem image in your FAT partition and try to point in fstab on it. But like with a swap file: the sequence matters. You need to make sure the FAT partition is mounted first, so the system will see your root filesystem image file to mount it. I experienced lately on my linux pc that the loop-option for filesystem images has become obsolete lately, so this might work pretty easily.<br />Just one more thing: if you have your root filesystem or swap on the usb drive, you should not hotplug or even remove it (without crashing the router). So I would recommend to use an usb drive that you will just dedicate to that router.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>has anybody checked the board for the voltage regulatror ? I want to drive my 1043ND within a car, so the input voltage will be between 11V - 14V. I did not find any information regarding this. For the older links wrt54 modells i found this and these are working really good. But I will upgrade/extend the old wrt54.</p><p>Thanks for any information on this <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Ronny</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rcmc_ronny</strong> on 27 Aug 2011, 10:52)</p>

					<p>@Ronnie: My opinion is that it will not harm, since it seems to use some step-down converter inside to create the needed voltages of 5V and below. The step-down converters I know so far have a pretty wide input range, so +/-15% should be fine. However I would recommend you to check the data sheets for U1 and U20 to be on the safe side (the pictures I&#039;ve got are too blurry to see anything).</p>									</div>

					<p>Guys! I have a problem connecting D-Link DWA-125 (rt3070) USB WiFi dongle to the TP-Link WR1043ND (ar71xx) router! Actually WiFi dongle doesn&#039;t work!<br />I&#039;m using OpenWRT BackFire 10.03.1-rc5 (tried also last Trunk). I have installed appropriate packages - kmod-rt2800-usb, kmod-rt2x00-usb. Router seems to recognize the dongle, but WiFi doesn&#039;t work! - it doesn&#039;t find wifi nets in vicinity (tried in LuCi), it doesn&#039;t connect to the wifi net, which exists (WiFi USB dongle state in LuCi is always - &quot;Not associated or disabled&quot;).<br />But WiFi LED (on the dongle) is blinking, signaling that device in work!<br />What can be the problem? Maybe rt3070 driver problem?<br />Many thanks in advance for assistance!</p>									</div>
