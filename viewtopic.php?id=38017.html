					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;m going to buy an ADSL Modem/Router, but I don&#039;t have much options, most of the available devices are <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/wiki/brcm63xx">brcm63xx</a> based (TP-Link W89xx, and others), which doesn&#039;t have an ADSL driver.</p><p>However, I found this Ralink based <a href="http://www.aztech.com/prod_adsl_dsl5005en.html">Aztech DSL5005EN</a> (Scroll to the HARDWARE section for more info). This device runs Linux already, as one can see in the system log screenshot from the manual:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www.lastown.com/tmp/DSL5005EN_SYSLOG.png" alt="http://www.lastown.com/tmp/DSL5005EN_SYSLOG.png" /></span></p><p>The question is: should I buy a brcm63xx based device and wait till ADSL driver is available so I can use OpenWrt on it, or do I go with the Aztech device and experiment with it? Please Advice.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m currently using openwrt on the Buffalo WBMR-HP-G300H which supports ADSL2+ and supposedly both a and b annexes. I&#039;m very happy it and you find a growing number of owners here for tech support as well.</p>									</div>

					<p>The way I chose my openwrt router was from this forum. Just look for any threads about the routers you are interested in and see how far people have got with putting openwrt on it.</p><p>Also which country are you in?
