					<p>control to work.<br />i have ultravnc viewer in listening mode on port 5500, on my computer.<br />i forwarded port 5500 to my computer lan ip address.<br />this is what i add in /etc/config/firewall :<br />config redirect<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option name &#039;UltraVNC&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option src &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;tcp&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option dest_ip &#039;192.168.1.10&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option dest_port &#039;5500&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option dest &#039;lan&#039;</p><br /><p>i also have a dyndns address that is the same as my wan address.<br />i configured ddns successfully on openwrt, so even if i restart my router, and my ip changed(i have dynamic ip from my isp), the address of dyndns pointing to my new wan address i get from my ISP.<br />to be sure, i pluged out my router from power line and connect it again, and after it started, i see that my new wan ip assign to my dyndns address.<br />i did it twice to be sure :-)</p><p>i send the ultravnc server to my friend, and it&#039;s configured to connect to my dyndns address on port 5500.<br />after my friend open the file(ultravnc server) on his computer, nothing happened on my computer.</p><p>before i switched to openwrt, i had the original firmware on my router (tp link 1043nd), and there, when my friend open the server, i immediately get his desktop in a window, on my screen.<br />i didn&#039;t changed anything with the server or the viewer configuration.<br />just changed the firmware in the router.</p><p>on the other hand, i open ports also for emule, exactly as i open the port for ultravnc.<br />the only differences between them are that in emule i opened also udp(tcpudp), but the other parameters are the same(except of course, that the port is different on both :-)), as the configuration of ultravnc, as i wrote in the start of this message.<br />i get high ID on emule, which if i understand well, telling me that the ports are opened perfectly.<br />and just to be sure, i also check the port on this site:<br /><a href="http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/">http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/</a></p><p>when emule is open, and it says that the port is open.</p><p>i have the latest firmware version of openwrt:<br /> 12.09-beta2 (squashfs)</p><p>any suggestions?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sholizar</strong> on 10 Nov 2012, 19:01)</p>

					<p>well, the issue solved :-).<br />in the default configuration of the firewall, it has just one section of zone forwarding.<br />i don&#039;t know if the default is from wan to lan, or the opposite, but after i forwarded both directions, i could also get the vnc to work :-).</p>									</div>
