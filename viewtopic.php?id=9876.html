					<p>You can basically find this chip on PC100 or PC133 ram sticks but needs to be 256MB with only single sided, 8 chips. or 256mb on notebooks. It should be 16MB x 16 bit configuration.

					<p>I couldn&#039;t find any appropriate DIMM&#039;s either, so I ended up buying them on Digikey. I ended up going with the Micron MT48LC16M16A2TG-7E SDRAM.

					<p>I&#039;m not sure if it was a hardware problem, or a soldering problem, but my first attempt failed - resulting in a destroyed router.</p><p>I was able to pull the Hynix part with no problem using a hot-air gun. I used a bit of kapton tape to keep the discretes from flying off the board. Took a few rounds, but the chip slid off with no problems. I let the board cool before cleaning the pads.</p><p>I even got the new SDRAM chip on just fine as well. It did take a bit to find all the opens, and get the soldered down, but eventually all 54 pins were firmly attached. </p><p>Then, nothing. Not even a peep out of the bootloader. I tried disconnecting the TX line on my LVTTL-&gt;RS232 converted, but I didn&#039;t even see the + character. I tried comparing each pin to a working router with a &#039;scope, and everything looked good. I saw activity on the data/address lines, and the clock enable pins were being pulled to the correct level.</p><p>I then tried to pull the Micron SDRAM up, and put the old Hynix chip back down - which is when I lifted the pad. Unfortunately, the signal went to a hidden via, and I couldn&#039;t find where it came back out for a repair. Rather than keep going, I just pulled the antenna, and tossed the router.</p><p>At this point, I&#039;m not sure if I chose an incompatible SDRAM chip, damaged the part during assembly, or just had a bad solder joint. I doubt the last one, because I reflowed all the solder after the first boot failure. (ran the hot-air gun over the pins until the solder reflowed). I visually inspected for shorts and opens, found a few opens (which I fixed), and no shorts.</p><p>The only other thing I can think of that might have caused a problem is when I used an old tooth-brush dipped in isopropyl alcohol to clean the flux off the board. I wouldn&#039;t have thought that could zap a chip, but it&#039;s worth noting.</p><p>The SDRAM I have is 4Mx16x4 (16-bits wide, 4banks, 4Mb/bank). The Hynix SDRAM is 2Mx16x4 (16-bits wide, 4 banks, 2Mb/bank)</p><p>At any rate, I&#039;m not going to sacrifice another router until I&#039;ve yellow-lined both datasheets thoroughly.</p>									</div>
