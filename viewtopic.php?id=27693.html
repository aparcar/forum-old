					<p>Hello guys,</p><p>Is someone here with TPLink WR741ND revision v1.9 with working OpenWRT image? I am currently trying to determine what image to use for my AP. I have used LUCI image r22796 and bricked it once <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> </p><p>As a fortunate misfortune, my router also got damaged power adapter so I got a replacement.... however, I am now completely paranoid to what to upload to my AP (it was my first contact with openwrt whatsoever). </p><p>According to the documents on wiki to this AP, version 1.9 only has only link to the latest trunk as a recommended. Can someone confirm r23991 to be working on this AP please ?&nbsp; I would appreciate it.</p><p>Thanks for reading <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zerxen</strong> on 11 Dec 2010, 18:32)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the reply. I&#039;ll start from the beginning, shall state its objectives and if I&#039;m wrong, please correct me. <br />Task: <br />1. Hardware mod - adding USB <br />2. Installing the firmware and kernel patch to support USB <br />3. Connecting Arduino and extra flash media to the router. <br />That is implemented: <br />1. Actually the Hardware mod. <br />2. It is now established Backfire 10.03.1 (r23714) </p><p>What do I do next: <br />1. I collect the firmware (100% works for you r23281): </p><p>svn co-r 23281 svn :/ / svn.openwrt.org / openwrt / trank <br />cd trunk <br />. / Scripts / feeds update-a <br />. / Scripts / feeds install-a </p><p>make menuconfig (here I choose the desired packages for USB and Arduino) </p><p>2. Then produce minor kernel patch: <br />-------------------------------------------------- ------------ <br /> --- A/files/arch/mips/ar71xx/Kconfig <br />+ + + B/files/arch/mips/ar71xx/Kconfig <br />-167.6 167.7 @ @ @ @ <br />        select AR71XX_DEV_AP91_PCI if PCI <br />        select AR71XX_DEV_GPIO_BUTTONS <br />        select AR71XX_DEV_LEDS_GPIO <br />+ Select AR71XX_DEV_USB <br />        default n <br />  <br /> config AR71XX_MACH_TL_WR841N_V1 <br />--- A/files/arch/mips/ar71xx/mach-tl-wr741nd.c <br />+ + + B/files/arch/mips/ar71xx/mach-tl-wr741nd.c <br />@ @ -20,6 +20,7 @ @ <br /> # Include &quot;dev-ap91-pci.h&quot; <br /> # Include &quot;dev-gpio-buttons.h&quot; <br /> # Include &quot;dev-leds-gpio.h&quot; <br />+ # Include &quot;dev-usb.h&quot; <br />  <br /> # Define TL_WR741ND_GPIO_LED_QSS 0 <br /> # Define TL_WR741ND_GPIO_LED_SYSTEM 1 <br />-99.6 100.8 @ @ @ @ <br />        u8 * mac = (u8 *) KSEG1ADDR (0x1f01fc00); <br />        u8 * ee = (u8 *) KSEG1ADDR (0x1fff1000); <br />  <br />+ Ar71xx_add_device_usb (); <br />+ <br />        ar71xx_add_device_m25p80 (&amp; tl_wr741nd_flash_data); <br />  <br />        ar71xx_add_device_leds_gpio (-1, ARRAY_SIZE (tl_wr741nd_leds_gpio), <br />-------------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>3. Putting firmware:</p><p>make </p><p>4. Next, fill the firmware in the router and configure. </p><p>I did not then remember? Meet firmware is r23281?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zxsergeant</strong> on 10 Jul 2013, 09:20)</p>
