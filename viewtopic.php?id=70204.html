					<p>hello:</p><p>i have a hootoo nano with a new install of openwrt using install directions found on this site (id=53014).</p><p>the router works properly when the single lan port is connected to an internal port on another router and works great to provide an internet connection to wireless clients. however, when the unit is connected directly to a cable modem it doesnt function. the cable modem doesnt appear to recognize the router or provide an address to it.</p><p>i have tried both settings of the wired/wireless switch on the hootoo- no luck. i think the solution is probably pretty simple, but i havent found it yet.</p><p>any help would be great appreciated!</p><p>j</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jaschoon</strong> on 13 Mar 2017, 21:16)</p>

					<p>On devices with one ethernet port, it starts out as lan.&nbsp; You should then set up a wifi so you can log in via wifi to lan.&nbsp; Then change the ethernet port to be wan.</p><p>Cable modems are almost always dhcp.&nbsp; If the modem is in router mode it will hand out multiple addresses that are private IPs and internally NAT them out to the Internet.&nbsp; If it is in bridge mode you can only get one IP through it, your public IP which goes directly to (or from) the Internet.</p>									</div>

					<p>mk24- quick question, please...</p><p>i have a wifi interface created so i can modify the eth config, which is set to &quot;lan&quot; originally. i have created a &quot;wan&quot; interface but dont understand the config necessary to use the eth interface as my wan connection. i tried a test of disabling the lan interface after i brought up the wan interface and i lost connectivity. here is what i need to do:</p><br /><ul><li><p>set the wan interface as a dhcp client (i think i have this set properly)</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>provide dhcp addresses to all wifi clients (i think this is done, too)</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>set a stateful firewall between the wan interface and the wifi interface</p></li></ul><br /><p>in the interfaces- wan/lan:<br /></p><ul><li><p>do i need to &quot;create(s) a bridge over specified interface(s)&quot; on the eth0 (wan/lan)?</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>i would expect to create/assign firewall-zone on the wan interface- is this right?</p></li></ul><p>thanks in advance!<br />j</p>									</div>

					<p>mk24- thanks for staying with me on this. i appreciate it.</p><p>earlier i went through and reconfig&#039;d the router and got it to work, but read your post and was concerned that it wasnt set properly (security, etc.). i backed up the router and tried out some of your suggestions. they needed more work so i tried to recover from backup, but the router had to be reverted to its base config.</p><p>once (if?) i can recover the settings i had i will post them. if you can help me understand the differences in best practice i would really appreciate it.</p><p>thanks!<br />j</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jaschoon</strong> on 14 Mar 2017, 21:40)</p>

					<p>all- i think the issue is resolved. mk24&#039;s suggestions made the difference.</p><p>i configured wifi first to allow the connect, then added wan (as dhcp) owith only eth0 (as he suggested). i dont think i had to change lan. i then added firewalls to each of the lan &amp; wan interfaces.</p><p>thanks very much!<br />j</p>									</div>

					<p>I will suggest that you make a backup of this working config.&nbsp; If for some reason your wireless gets &quot;hosed&quot; (no lan access) your only option may be to reset the device to factory, which puts the LAN back on the Ethernet port.&nbsp; With a backup, you can reset the device and then quickly restore the backup and your good to go.</p>									</div>
