					<p>Hello, I&#039;ve bricked my e3200 by installing OpenWRT firmware which I compiled from trunk. As it was mentioned the truck already has support for this device. <br />At this point device blinks when I power it on and I can get 3 ping response from 192.168.1.1 but no more. No TFTP or DHCP requests.<br /> I have some experience with Linux, but not much with hardware hacking and soldering.<br /> I&#039;ve managed to connect USB to RS232 TTL Converter Module (looks like the one on the picture: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/port.serial)">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/port.serial)</a> to the pads marked on the picture as a Serial. </p><p>The problem is the device is not detected on the PC. No sign that something becomes connected.<br />I tried to reorder connections with the Serial and the Remote download adapter. Nothing I&#039;ve tried, have provided me with /dev/ttyUSB0. </p><p> Although I never connected power pin, could I burn something on the PCB?<br /> May be someone can give an advice how to proceed? Search for telephone cable for Nokia? Use multimeter? What to look for? It&#039;s also unclear to me should I use &quot;TTL Broadcom USB Remote Download Adapter&quot; is this some equivalent to the Serial?</p>									</div>

					<p>I also tried the trick with boot_wait and tftp. Tftp client sends data, the router stays pingable, power led blinks slowly and a flash process seems to be unsuccessful.</p>									</div>
