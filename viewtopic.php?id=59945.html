					<p>I need a new wifi router. I wanted to buy one that supported OpenWRT, and I learned here that you can screen for OpenWRT at Amazon’s website. My other criteria were “small and cheap”; here’s the unit that I currently favor: </p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JKFE0FW?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=ox_sc_act_title_1&amp;smid=A364119SDJA4QG">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JKF … 119SDJA4QG</a></p><p>Note the description says, “Customized OpenWrt system, well configured” </p><p>Should that give me pause for concern? I don’t believe I can depend on the hardware manufacturer for ongoing firmware upgrades, and therefore I want to avoid buying something with a “proprietary version” of OpenWRT. I don’t want a discourse on licensing, but I was hoping that the cognoscenti here could comment generally on this “customized” business, and on the hardware pedigree of this particular box. </p><p>Many thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>No need to worry, this hardware is well supported by OpenWRT, and the manufacturer even provides instructions on how to build your own OpenWRT from the official sources:</p><p><a href="http://www.gl-inet.com/build-your-own-openwrt-for-gl-inet/">http://www.gl-inet.com/build-your-own-o … r-gl-inet/</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you, &#039;scum, that&#039;s very reassuring. I&#039;ve found a few routers that are smaller, and I have questions about those, but guess that should go in a new post.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, RangerZ. Looks like they have two OpenWRT units, but they&#039;re considerably larger than the Gl.iNet router I found on Amazon. I need small - very small. </p><p>Actually, I&#039;m not sure I even need a router. I&#039;m trying to &quot;bridge&quot; a USB device via WiFi. A couple of people have done this using OpenWRT (here&#039;s one: <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Wireless-tethered-shooting-with-any-DSLR-camera-V3/),">http://www.instructables.com/id/Wireles … mera-V3/),</a> but that may be due only to the fact that it provides a layer of software that can be modified, whereas the USB-WiFi devices don&#039;t seem to have that. I started in this direction, but then thought, &quot;why a router? all I want is to use the WiFi to transport my USB data in point-point fashion.&quot;</p><p>Anyway, I guess this has gotten off-topic a bit, but if you&#039;ve got any ideas along that line, I&#039;d love to hear them.</p>									</div>

					<p>There are lots of devices out there that have firmware optimized for their application, but run a hardware set that supports Openwrt.&nbsp; Any device, like a Pogoplug, that can run OpenWRT becomes a &quot;router&quot; by installing the software.&nbsp; It may, and probably will, loose some functionality.&nbsp; Virtually all the &quot;Travel Routers&quot; forgoe their IOS/Android Apps once OpenWRT is installed.</p><p>Don&#039;t use base your solution on OpenWRT, base it on functionality.&nbsp; If you do not need a router, don&#039;t build one.</p><p>Regarding the ZBT, I was just trying to get the info into a post with a title that was appropriate.&nbsp; I know that are not small, but the car units are kind of cool!</p>									</div>

					<p>You&#039;re right. But I want to get *something* working so I can move forward. It&#039;s useful to have an idea, but I&#039;ll learn more faster by getting something that works now. I think it was Patton who said, &quot;A good plan, executed today, is far better than a perfect plan executed tomorrow.&quot; </p><p>And yes - the info on the ZBT routers was perfectly on point. Those car routers are cool!</p>									</div>
