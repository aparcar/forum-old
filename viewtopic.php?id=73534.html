					<p>Hi Folks,</p><p>Can someone help me understand some strange behavior on the WRT3200ACM.&nbsp; Related to the region setting of the radios. </p><p>It&#039;s been well documented in many forum threads that the MWLWIFI driver for the 3200ACM will ignore the UCI setting for radio region.&nbsp; According to the driver author this is because the driver will automatically set the region somehow.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/kaloz/mwlwifi">https://github.com/kaloz/mwlwifi</a><br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>All WRT3200ACM devices are programmed with device power table. Mwlwifi driver will base on region code to set country code for your device and it will not allow you to change country code.</p></blockquote></div><p>Firstly, how is this even possible?<br />Secondly, it sets the regions incorrectly for my router, which is based in the UK, but ends up with these settings regardless of what I enter through UCI. </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@LEDE:~# iw reg get

					<p>I don&#039;t know specifically about the 3200, but the &quot;automatic&quot; region would be based on the manufacturer flashing in a unit-specific calibration table for the intended country of sale.&nbsp; This table is somewhere in flash and is treated as read-only by OpenWrt.</p>									</div>
