					<p>AFAIK, /64 is the largest network mask you should use in IPv6; see &quot;<a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/426183/how-does-ipv6-subnetting-work-and-how-does-it-differ-from-ipv4-subnetting">http://serverfault.com/questions/426183 â€¦ subnetting</a>&quot; for an explanation of why; if your provider is leasing only a /64 to you, I guess you are out of luck, I do not know how to create subnets with that.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have IPv6 by means of a tunnel freely provided by Hurricane Electric (<a href="https://tunnelbroker.net/">https://tunnelbroker.net/</a>); I get a /64 (which is only used for the tunnel itself), and a /48 that I use to create separated /64 subnetworks: I have a LAN network, a DMZ network, and a GUEST network.</p><p>I also have an old (2.3) Android phone connected by wifi to that network; it gets an IPv6 address, and can browse IPv6-only sites (in fact, I have detected that &quot;Google Play Services&quot; will use IPv6 when available).</p>									</div>
