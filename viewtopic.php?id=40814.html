					<p>1) /tmp is ram, not flash, so if you lose power, you lose your logs.&nbsp; You might want a small usb hub so you can attach both your serial drive and a flash drive.&nbsp; But if you do log to flash, I don&#039;t see that you would destroy the device in the short run.&nbsp; Even if you are offloading daily and erasing, I would think you would have years of writing before the device would become unuseable.</p><p>2) Don&#039;t know.&nbsp; I&#039;ve connected for weeks with a CP2102 serial dongle (ttl).&nbsp; I assume your PL2303 has a DB9 connector, so is RS232 logic levels.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had these successfully connected for long periods of times to other openWrt devices, but not to a WR703N, so haven&#039;t seen this issue.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lizby</strong> on 29 Nov 2012, 22:05)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the reply.</p><p>1) sorry, I forgot I can&#039;t log to /tmp, I can&#039;t fill tmpfs with kernel boot logs and crash the router, I&#039;ll have to log to flash. I&#039;m just hopefuly that the flash will be good enough to support normal logging (yes, I know about reasonable flash wear, just making sure that one doesn&#039;t have worse flash than an average device)</p><p>2) I found the problem in another thread. There is a problem with USB support on that device for slower speed devices<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39956&amp;p=4">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 56&amp;p=4</a> post 84 gives the details.<br />apparently using the right kind of passive hub is a workaround for that issue which seems to be due to the high speed USB chip that is used in the device.</p><p>Thanks for your answer, Marc</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Marc,</p><p>I investigated in the other thread on the AR9331 USB problem: there is definitively an issue with Low-Speed and Full-Speed devices, that may cause the USB connection to crash after a few minutes to one hour.</p><p>I confirm that the only known workaround is to insert a hub in-between.</p><p>As for logging to flash, the TL-WR703N Flash capacity is rather limited (4MB total), so I suggest you to use a small 2x USB HS hub + microSD combo like this (the microSD connector is located inside the USB connector on the right):<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www.pearl.de/images/large/px5294_2_2.jpg" alt="http://www.pearl.de/images/large/px5294_2_2.jpg" /></span></p><p>Available from <a href="http://www.pearl.fr/peripheriques/hubs-usb/hubs/mini-hub-2-ports-usb-2_0-avec-lecteur-de-cartes_PX5294.html">here</a> (in French) or <a href="http://www.pearl.de/a-PX5294-1133.shtml">here</a> (in German).</p><p>But even on microSD, you have to use the right&nbsp; FS (NOT vfat, use ext4 if possible, it is at least a 2x performance boost over plain ext2) and tune it to avoid unnecessary Flash wear by using &quot;lazy&quot; write options. Among these, here are some hints:<br /></p><ol class="decimal"><li><p><strong>noatime</strong> to avoid writing last access time back to disk (!!!)</p></li><li><p><strong>commit</strong> to set the commit period, default is 5s, you can probably increase it to 120s if you can afford to lose this amount of log in case of a crash</p></li><li><p><strong>data=writeback</strong> to specify the journaling method to use</p></li></ol><p>Just using the first two tricks will reduce the Flash wear by a 60 factor, so your disk will have a life expectancy increased from 6 months to 30 years under constant write...</p>									</div>

					<p>Regarding USB serial ports, all TTL UART to USB converters I know of are either Low-Speed or (most of them) Full-Speed, none are High-Speed because 480 Mbps is not required for a serial link anyway. So you almost certainly fall onto the AR9331 non High-Speed problem, unless you connect it to a High-Speed hub in between and not directly to the TL-WR703N USB connector.</p><p>Then, regarding the internal serial port, using a PL2303 or CP2102 cheap adapter like a Nokia CA42 cable clone is better than using an FTDI based solution because of the voltage level problem I mentioned.</p><p>And no, you can&#039;t get a telnet session over serial, but you have access to a serial U-Boot/Linux console using either a serial terminal emulator or &quot;screen&quot; on the PC side.</p>									</div>
