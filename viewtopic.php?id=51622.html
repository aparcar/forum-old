					<p>Hello everybody,<br />my first post so forgive me for any error .)<br />i have a 1043nd v 2.1 with installed OPenWrt (through the librarybox install packet, if someone knows it). <br />I need to take the router back to the factory firmware, so i follow the instructions here <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd#back.to.original.firmware">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl- … l.firmware</a> , downloaded the &quot;cutted&quot; version of the v2 firmware in the same page, tried with the sysupgrade cmd but i got the&nbsp; &quot;Image check &#039;platform_check_image&#039; failed&quot; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> <br />so i tried with the mtd command, but same result with &quot;couldn&#039;t open the image&quot;<br />anyone has some ideas? May i have to try with the v1 firmware (don&#039;t think, but..)?<br />Thank you in advance, </p><p>Marco.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello again danymarc,<br />thanks for the link, i&#039;ve downloaded the new firmware and tried also with that, but i think that i have understood the problem here...<br />when i connect via ftp through WinSCP and i copy the firmware file in the /tmp directory, i&#039;m copying it in the /tmp directory of the usb stick!! so when i get into openwrt through putty and i give the command cd /tmp, it is redirecting me in the /tmp folder of the device (the right one).<br />i tried to unplug the usb stick and get in to the device through winscp to upload correctly the file, but i get back a persistent refuse from the machine; so i&#039;m not able to ftp the device if the usb stick is unplugged...<br />i&#039;m sorry for being this noob, but i understand this only now.<br />the question is how can i copy the firmware file on the device (not in the usb stick...)?<br />is it possible to download the firmware from the ssh interface directly from the web? (i think this sould be the ip address <a href="ftp://tplink-forum.pl/orgin_bez_boot/wr1043v2_en_3_15_31_up(130925).bin)?">ftp://tplink-forum.pl/orgin_bez_boot/wr … 925).bin)?</a><br />thank you guys!</p>									</div>

					<p>ok, RESOLVED!<br />i&#039;m a real noob, i have to admit it....<br />the solution was really simple: get through ssh into the device (usb stick unplugged) and give:<br />cd /tmp<br />wget <a href="http://www.whatever.com/whatever/firmware.bin">http://www.whatever.com/whatever/firmware.bin</a><br />sysupgrade firmware.bin firmware</p><p>i was missing the wget part and just copying the firmware through winscp, but in the wrong folder <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />thank you all and sorry for being so noob!:P</p>									</div>
