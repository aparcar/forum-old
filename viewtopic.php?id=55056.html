					<p><strong>Important notice: This has only been tested with the latest stable Barrier Breaker release!</strong></p><p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve done some research and came to the conclusion that there is currently no protocol extension available to configure IPv6 connectivity through AICCU in LuCI.</p><p>To allow AICCU configuration in LuCI I&#039;ve created a simple (yet far from finished but already working) protocol extension. You can download it here: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/tply4f2jj1cjdc4/luci-proto-aiccu.tar.gz?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/tply4f2jj1cjd … ar.gz?dl=0</a></p><p>To install the extension, just download the archive in the root (/) directory of you OpenWrt box and extract it.</p><p>I haven&#039;t tested the LuCI feature of automatically recognizing missing packages (aiccu is set as mandatory in the extension) so you still might need to manually install the <strong>aiccu</strong> package through opkg before you can use this extension. </p><p>As already stated, the extension is far from finished and currently only supports some basic settings.<br />Both AYIYA and Heartbeat tunnels are supported but I haven&#039;t tested with a Heartbeat tunnel yet as I&#039;m using AYIYA in my setup.</p><p>Here is a sample screenshot of the settings panel:<br /><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/520067/OpenWrt/luci-proto-aiccu.png">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/520 … -aiccu.png</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Nice.</p><p>Another has been posted by me on github and a pull request has been posted for that one as <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/luci/pull/315/">https://github.com/openwrt/luci/pull/315/</a> It covers all aiccu UCI options as read by /lib/netifd/proto/aiccu.sh.</p><p>I like your wrapping up of the tunnel type into the heartbeat option and I possibly shall take the liberty of copying that into mine.</p><p>BTW FYI, I&#039;ve tested aiccu on CC with options nat and heartbeat both set to true and it seems to work ok.</p><p>Paul</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>por</strong> on 6 Feb 2015, 13:17)</p>

					<p>Sure thing. Go ahead and take everything you need to make the extension perfect <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>I&#039;d be happy to see this in some future version of LuCi to make the configuration of a SixXS IPv6 Tunnel much easier.</p>									</div>
