					<p>I own a iptv box which it is possible to get to play from a lan source if it is tricked by getting a dhcp response from a certain ip and false dns records.</p><p>What I want to do is getting dnsmasq to act as a dhcp server for the ip the box wants dhcp response from.</p><p>I got this far: (the box also needs gateway set to 0.0.0.0)<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#set ip
dhcp-host=00:02:9b:xx:xx:xx,192.168.66.200

#specify the gateway
dhcp-option-force=net:iptv,3,0i
#specify dns
dhcp-option-force=net:iptv,6,192.168.66.1,192.168.66.1,192.168.66.1
#set private flag
dhcp-option-force=net:iptv,128,239.16.x.x:5555
#server identifier flag
#seems we cannot set this because then the server wont listen anymore =/
dhcp-option-force=net:iptv,54,213.64.x.x

#tag the box
dhcp-mac=iptv,00:02:9B:xx:xx:xx</code></pre></div><p>The box accepts the dhcp offer and sends a request, the problem is that the request is directed at the &quot;fake ip&quot;.</p><p>Is there some way to get dnsmasq to listen to that address?</p><p>I&#039;m thinking some sort of routing (and rewriting?) with ebtables or setting up a new interface. I tried a proxy forwarder but the problem is that it can&#039;t use the port at the same time as dnsmasq.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>thomasa88</strong> on 23 Mar 2008, 17:01)</p>
