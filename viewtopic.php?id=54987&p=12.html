					<p>Has anyone got IPv6 to work on PandorasBox? I&#039;ve set up another interface on eth0.2 with DHCPv6, but there&#039;s still no connectivity, and I feel like I&#039;m missing something really obvious.</p><p>Edit: it worked out of the box on Chaos Calmer. Weird. But then the wireless speeds are terrible.<br />Edit2: got it to work, will post some more info when I&#039;m done double checking everything. Could probably be implemented into the base firmware, too.</p><p>Edit3: here&#039;s the changes required for a DHCPv4+DHCPv6 setup:</p><p>1. Generate your ULA prefix using <a href="http://unique-local-ipv6.com/">this tool</a> (or any other way, really) and set it in /etc/config/network</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config globals &#039;globals&#039;
    option ula_prefix &#039;fd1c:f678:470c::/48&#039;</code></pre></div><p>2. Add a DHCPv6 WAN interface:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;wan6&#039;
    option ifname &#039;eth0.2&#039;
    option proto &#039;dhcpv6&#039;
    option macaddr &#039;53:3f:ac:e2:fa:ce&#039;</code></pre></div><p>3. Now, set up the firewall.</p><p>Set <em>disable_ipv6</em> to <em>0</em> (or just remove the setting entirely).<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config defaults
    option disable_ipv6 &#039;0&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Add our new <em>wan6</em> interface to the <em>wan</em> zone:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config zone
    option name &#039;wan&#039;
    list network &#039;wan&#039;
    list network &#039;wan6&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Then uncomment the <em>&#039;Allow-DHCPv6&#039;</em>, <em>&#039;Allow-MLD&#039;</em>, <em>&#039;Allow-ICMPv6-Input&#039;</em> and <em>&#039;Allow-ICMPv6-Forward&#039;</em> rules. </p><p>I also changed <em>&#039;Allow-DHCPv6&#039;</em> to bring it in line with trunk, which has a slightly simpler version, but that shouldn&#039;t be necessary:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config rule
    option name &#039;Allow-DHCPv6&#039;
    option src &#039;wan&#039;
    option proto &#039;udp&#039;
    option src_ip &#039;fc00::/6&#039;
    option dest_ip &#039;fc00::/6&#039;
    option dest_port &#039;546&#039;
    option family &#039;ipv6&#039;
    option target &#039;ACCEPT&#039;</code></pre></div><p>4. Finally, apply all the settings and start the DHCPv6 server on the router network:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># /etc/init.d/network reload
# /etc/init.d/firewall reload
# /etc/init.d/odhcpd start
# /etc/init.d/odhcpd enable</code></pre></div><p>5. Renegotiate a DHCP lease on the connected devices (or just reboot the whole thing).</p><p>Edit4: just tested this exact process on a clean install, and it works just fine. @StrangeOrange: maybe this should be the default setup? It makes sense to me, at least. All we really need to do to make this work out of the box is to roll in the firewall/interface changes and keep /etc/uci-defaults/12_network-generate-ula so that it replaces the ULA prefix with something sane on first boot.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>K900</strong> on 7 Feb 2016, 13:25)</p>

					<p>I was close to write that really the latest version is indeed the most stable one and it is not unfortunately ;-(<br />After a week in production, I started to download aprox. 7MB/s on 4 threads via one 2.4GHz client (another AP) - 6 hours uptime and the problems started - this AP get no ping (was connected but nothing went trough) it wasn&#039;t possible to get connected to the Xiaomi router externally, no error in Syslog or Kernel log....just reboot fixed that. Btw, other 2.4 + 5 GHz clients were working fine during the same time. Yes, it didn&#039;t get fixed even when I stop the download.<br />@StrangeOrange, any idea how I can investigate such problem when it happens again ? Some debug or something, WiFi statistics&nbsp; ?</p><p>Still the latest version I like so far the most (two issues only, at the beginning as I reported and now...).<br />Note : From external packages, I&#039;m using only Watchcat, which is harmless and Commands.</p>									</div>

					<p>I just would like to tell a story how I tried Pandora r1597, later rolling back to r1024 <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>r1024 is stable and it has been working w/o any problems, but somebody in this topic mentioned r1597 has improved 2,4 GHz performance, so I decided to try it.<br />First of all, I haven&#039;t noticed any performance growth, as I have up to 10MB/sec on both r1024 and r1597 @ 2,4 Ghz.<br />But r1597 brought me the problems: if I download some torrent (by uTorrent), let&#039;s say some 4GB file @ 2,4GHz on good speed, like 7-8MB/sec or more - after about 0,5-1GB amount downloaded the WiFi connection with the router just drops. Sometimes it restores back automatically after some minutes, sometimes not. And there is nothing helpful in the router System Log about the issue causes (just WPA2/AES keys re-initialization or like that). And I could reproduce this issue very easily.</p><p>So, I&#039;m back on r1024 - never such problems with that. Probably there are real reasons why r1597 is still in the testing directory.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>darkpsy</strong> on 10 Feb 2016, 00:22)</p>

					<p>In the wiki I see that it says U-Boot disables writing to the console after first boot, afterwards it will be disabled by the firmware. Would&nbsp; it be possible to replace U-Boot to another one after installing/running OpenWRT/PandoraBox? I assume it will be accepted but I want to make sure as I don&#039;t want to get in the same situation I was in before where I had to short two resistors to change the processor mode to accept new bootloader, if that is even possible at all. It might be that I have mistaken the whole process and installing another OS will by default replace the bootloader but since the Xiaomi one can boot OpenWRT it might not be necessary to change it for the router to work.</p><p>I also read that the radio calibration procedure is different from what OpenWRT, does Pandorabox do anything about this or are there other reasons for selecting this over regular OpenWRT? And is there any U-Boot available that is not Chinese but English? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>I ordered a Xiaomi Mini on AliExpress from a seller who claimed to sell the original English version and also be an authorized reseller. Of course, me as blind as a sheep ordered it. This firmware may or may not be official and something they have modified to be in English, sometimes even the power adapter arrives unoriginal with some weird socket that doesn&#039;t seem to fit any wall outlets (It&#039;s like the EU one just not long enough pins and too wide). This is of course not a problem, I have 12V2A adapter ready. I just wonder before I get it if anyone here knows how safe this firmware is (I&#039;ve seen phones with malware, Xiaomi apps with malware etc) so that I might now want to run it on that fake firmware and can install the firmware from their site to revert to original stock? If anything I wonder what they have done to it. Since the US adapter has Mi marks and appear to be original from Xiaomi it could be possible they officially translated an older version of the firmware to English language for US market at some point? Will post back here once I get it and can investigate. <br />Just a heads up since the seller already pushed 10 000 units...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>courfazor</strong> on 12 Feb 2016, 14:40)</p>

					<p>I&#039;ve manage to use 5Ghz in client mode. Previously it can&#039;t connect to my AP because it&#039;s using channel 60. I changed the AP to channel 149 and it has successfully connected. I can say that the 2Ghz signal strength is at 100% compared to vanilla openwrt trunk which is around 80%. The 5ghz are 100% on both setups.&nbsp; However I find that the package drop is quite severe. I have virtually no package drop on vanilla openwrt but StrangeOrange&#039;s pandora are quite obvious, almost 10% package drop in a few minutes. I&#039;ve tested both on V3 and V4 I&#039;m hoping for a v5 that will address this issue. Many thanks StrangeOrange for your effort!</p>									</div>

I think in many cases things can still be made to work on a per-package basis but it might take some gymnastics. If you&#039;re not comfortable with it, your options include using one of the older versions, although it&#039;ll be a trade-off, so I&#039;d say the newest version is the best to go with unless you have a reason not to.
