					<p>Hi,</p><p>I recently installed a second router in my network to expand my wifi network. To have more options and control I have installed openwrt on this router. I already have another router in my network with openwrt wich does the dhcp and dns in the network.</p><p>The problem now is that this second router is also distributing ip addresses to the connected devices creating a second network. But I want all devices to be in the same network. </p><p>I have connected the new router with the old router via the wan port.</p><p>I have already tried disabling dnsmasq on the second router wich leaded to a brick.</p><p>The second router is a TPLink TL-WR841N with squashfs and luci as gui. Could someone tell me how I can set up this router to use the dhcp of the other router?</p><p>Thank you in advance,<br />Jerodev</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jerodev</strong> on 3 Aug 2014, 14:37)</p>

					<p>I may be wrong, but to me it looks like you want to configure a repeater, all IPs from the same network, using two APs, one DHCP.<br />I tried to configure it over the weekend following this <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39077">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39077</a><br />I was able to get DHCP responses, I can access all intranet from both APs, but I cannot access outside from the new AP, still investigating.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey there.</p><p>When areading the initial description: No, he&#039;s not trying to run OpenWRT in repeater mode. That&#039;s not his actual problem. He just connecte both (I guess via cable, but that doesn&#039;t matter to his problem) and now both are distributing DHCP announcing themselfs as primary gateway.</p><p>If you go GUI wise:</p><p>* Enter LuCI<br />* Go to &quot;interfaces&quot;<br />** delete the &quot;wan&quot; interface<br />* go to &quot;switch&quot;<br />** Assign the WAN port to switch, too. You don&#039;t need it as WAN interface<br />* Go back to &quot;interaces&quot;<br />** Edit &quot;lan&quot;<br />** In Section &quot;DHCP Server&quot; in tab &quot;General Setup&quot; tick the &quot;Ignore Interace&quot; checkbox<br />* Make sure to have both routers on different IP addresses, of course. </p><p>Save, done.</p><p>There&#039;s not a single step about repeater modes.</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>									</div>
