					<p>I&#039;m trying to hack this device and I&#039;ve created a page on the wiki with everything I know so far: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/belkin/f5d8635-4v1_danube">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/belkin/f5d8635-4v1_danube</a></p><p>The stock bootloader is u-boot however there seems to be a problem with the default setup, there is a datablock called ubootconfig in the middle of the partition just after kernel and sysconfig datablocks, and I think that ubootconfig it is the U-boot environment. If this is the case then it is a problem but can anyone confirm it isn&#039;t anything else?</p><p>I see 3 possible solutions:<br />1) Reconfigure u-boot(without reinstalling) to change the location of U-boot environment. Is this possbile?<br />2) Easy: make openwrt aware of this datablock and make sure it respects U-boot environment<br />3) Complex: compile my own U-boot and change the location of U-boot environment</p><p>The third option is the most complex one because I would have to find the bootstap pins so I can boot in CFG 04 mode if I want to be able to recover from failures. Do you know how can I find the bootstrap pins?</p>									</div>
