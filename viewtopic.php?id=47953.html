					<p>I tried the trunk build of bb, wifi seems much better on my wr841n, however I have problems with ipv6. I was not able to ssh to my router, because I got ipv6 adress only in ifconfig eth0, I don&#039;t know what ipv6 adress should I ssh to, I don&#039;t know a thing about ipv6 and to be honest I don&#039;t want to know (yet).&nbsp; What is the correct way to disable ipv6? I don&#039;t want it at all, we still have plenty of ipv4 adresses in here, so most isps (including mine) do not support ipv6, so I don&#039;t need it too. Why should i rembeber adress like a week long, when I can still use those nice ipv4 adresses...</p><p>In etc/config there&#039;s<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># Uncomment this line to disable ipv6 rules
