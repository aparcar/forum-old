					<p>While reading the wiki page on the WL500GP I&#039;m now curious where in the hardware the NVRAM is stored?&nbsp; Is that in the flash itself, or is it another memory technology?&nbsp; If it is part of flash, could any code at the driver level that can write to flash write on the NVRAM part?</p><p>I&#039;m curious why reloading the box doesn&#039;t reset the IP address.&nbsp; Is it just that the IP address is stored in a different place discontiguous from the code that would get reloaded?</p><p>What if the bootloader gets destroyed?&nbsp; Is that when the lack of JTAG means this becomes a brick?</p><p>Does anyone have an address list of what is generally stored where?&nbsp; Like where is the boot loader (that loads from TFTP if you engage it to do that), the kernel (where saved after loading from TFTP), the NVRAM, and that IP address used by the boot loader that never gets reset.</p><p>How does the manufacturer initialize this w/o JTAG?&nbsp; Or do they pre-load the flash chip from another machine before it gets soldered in during fabrication?</p>									</div>
