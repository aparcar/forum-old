					<p>Hi</p><p>I am quite new to Linux and Openwrt but I managed to compile a C program and make it work on my WRT54G (v3.1).<br />Well.. almost work. I wanted to port a program that send binary signal to RTS line of serial port and send this signal through DMZ led (GPIO 7 on my router).</p><p>I took inspiration from the SD/MMC source codes and came up with something like </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>--8&lt;--snip----

static unsigned char mask = 1 &lt;&lt; 7;
static volatile unsigned char *gpio_output = ( unsigned char * ) 0xb8000064;

if (atoi(argv[1])==1){
    *gpio_output |= mask;
} else {
    *gpio_output &amp;= ~mask;
}

--8&lt;--snip----</code></pre></div><p>The program compiles but I get a &quot;Bus error&quot; when executed</p><p>I tried to fwrite to /proc/diag/led/dmz but I think that the file writing is buffered and my signal gets all messed up.</p><p>What am I missing ? I suspect that the gpio_output address is different from a chip to another, may this be the cause of my problem ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Maybe your kernel has no gpio support? That is the way I currently use the gpios and it works very well. You also might have to include gpio-dev etc.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think that you are right. There is probably limited GPIO support for WRT54G as I don&#039;t find gpioctl in the list of available packages for my platform (<a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/brcm-2.4/packages/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … /packages/</a>).</p><p>I&#039;ll try again by compiling an image for brcm47xx.</p>									</div>

					<p>solved. That was indeed a gpio support issue. Once the image compiled with brcm47xx profile, the open(&quot;/dev/gpio/&quot;, O_RDWR) solution works. Thanks for your help.</p>									</div>
