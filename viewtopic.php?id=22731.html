					<p>I&#039;m saddled with 7 HP 10ag&#039;s which I need to get to run WifiDog.&nbsp; They come with Openwrt installed (Kamikaze 2.4), but it&#039;s such a stripped down version - no opkg, no ssh, etc - and has such limited resources - 2mb flash - that just installing opkg and adding packages hasn;t worked out.</p><p>Being as you can&#039;t get a console out of the box, I&#039;ve got a serial connection via a MAX232 / RS232 set up and can get the boot process to pause at the uBoot console.&nbsp; In theory I think I should be able to just either grab a pre-built Atheros image or build one myself and then copy it down the serial cable via Kermit or tftp it, write it to flash and then boot away.&nbsp; Thing is I can&#039;t get any images to boot, with the exception of the awful HP firmware image.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried numerous images and they all give me the same response:&nbsp; uBoot replies &#039;Bad magic number&#039; when I issue the bootm command.&nbsp; For instance if I do the following at the uBoot console;</p><p>tftpboot 0x80000000 openwrt-atheros-rootsquashfs.img<br />bootm 0x80000000</p><p>I get the response:&nbsp; &#039;Bad magic number&#039; </p><p>If I do the same, except I tftp over the last HP released firmware, it&#039;ll boot fine.</p><p>I&#039;m aware that uBoot uses a wrapper with a specific header in, and that the utility mkimage can convert images to have the correct header.&nbsp; However from what I&#039;ve read, uBoot should be able to handle Openwrt images, but there may be some need to work out memory offsets and give bootm a different address than tftpboot saves the image to.</p><p>I appreciate this straddles the uBoot/Openwrt divide and I might be better asking in the uBoot forums.&nbsp; Thing is I&#039;m at the limit of my knowledge and don&#039;t know whether I&#039;m getting the Openwrt side wrong and just need to use the toolchain better to produce the correct image, or if I&#039;m just feeding uBoot drivel.&nbsp; Also the uBoot forums scare me a bit as I&#039;m technically minded, but not in that technically minded.</p><p>Any pointers would be gratefully received as otherwise we&#039;re stuck with seven horrific WAPs, and my brain badly mangled.&nbsp; Initially I&#039;d just like it to boot, but ultimately I&#039;ll be needing it burnt to the paltry 2mb flash.</p><p>Thanks in advance and thanks to all involved in Openwrt as it&#039;s currently working marvels on our ASUS WLgp500V2&#039;s.&nbsp; Just a shame I couldn&#039;t have stopped the contractors from buying this HP muck before they did.</p><br /><p>Calum.</p>									</div>
