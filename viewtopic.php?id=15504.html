					<p>Hi everyone.</p><p>I was just wondering if anyone has tried making OpenWRT boot off a NFS mount?</p><p>eg. I have a WRT54GS which is currently running OpenWRT, and I wanted to make it have the / partition on my NFS server instead. </p><p>I know how to do this with &quot;normal&quot; boxes (x86 etc), but the WRT is quite limited, and I&#039;m not entirely sure how to go about doing it.</p><p>I know that the kernel must have support for NFS Root, and either a DHCP server or the Boot loader must provide details of where the NFS share is, (i have only done it using the bootloader method on normal computers, and I&#039;m not entirely sure if the bootloader in the WRT54GS would support this).</p><p>Anyone done this before or have any tips?</p>									</div>
