					<p>There are basically four possibilities:</p><p>- you connected your second router with a LAN port to your primary router, instead of using the WAN port.<br />- you somehow bridged WAN and LAN (maybe via wlan)<br />- you&#039;re using the same subnet (like 192.168.1.0/24) on WAN and LAN, thereby messing up the firewall rules<br />- your router&#039;s switch chip doesn&#039;t get initialized early enough, so there is (short) timeframe during the router (re-)boot where all ethernet ports are bridged together (long enough for clients&#039; to get dhcp leases from the primary router), until the switch gets properly configured by linux.</p>									</div>

					<p>No, there is no way to set this from an enduser perspective. If this is indeed the case, there are only two possible options, changing the bootloader (e.g. u-boot) to initialize the switch properly before handing over to the linux kernel or inserting a tiny second stage loader between bootloader (e.g. u-boot) and linux kernel, with the sole purpose to disable or properly configure the switch before linux starts (this is e.g. done for several ar71xx targets, shortening, but not completely removing, the time frame the switch remains unconfigured and passes through data from all ports) - both of these options require knee-deep programming knowledge and intimate familiarity with the affected device.</p><p>While you yourself probably won&#039;t be able to fix this bug, you can at least confirm the situation easily - remove all cables from your second router, connect power and boot it up completely (give it a couple of minutes to be sure) and re-attach the (ethernet) cables, if your problem doesn&#039;t happen again while the second router is running/ not restarted, you&#039;re not affected by this switch-initialization problem and you have to check for other causes.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>slh</strong> on 5 Apr 2017, 04:40)</p>

					<p>If you followed the suggested test and if I understand your report correctly, you&#039;re not affected by any switch initialization troubles - so you&#039;re more likely plagued by one of the first 3 potential causes I raised, maybe in disguise.</p>									</div>
