					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;ve got a &quot;la fonera&quot; since 1 year aprox., I installed OpenWrt the first week I had it and it has been working without problems until yesterday that I changed some configuration temporarily and now I can&#039;t rewrite the config: </p><p>- wlan is up, but it doesn&#039;t assign any IP via dhcp when connecting, so I can&#039;t do anything there.<br />- if i plug the ethernet wire, it doesn&#039;t do anything: no dhcp offers to the pc and no dhcp trying to get an IP.<br />- I tried to enter failsafe, I get the message &quot;push reset to enter failsafe mode&quot; but nothing happens if I do that (I don&#039;t get the message &quot;entering failsafe mode&quot; and telnet says me &quot;bad login&quot; or something like that&quot;), but it seems to be in failsafe mode because the IP is 192.168.1.1 and in the normal it isn&#039;t.<br />- I tried to enter via telnet to redboot, but it doesn&#039;t work too.</p><p>Well... any ideas? I know I can do anything via the serial wire, but it prefer to do that in the &quot;net&quot; way because I don&#039;t have the serial cable... the first time I hacked it with ethernet too.</p><br /><p>Regards,</p><br /><p>Ayoze</p>									</div>
