					<p>Hello,</p><br /><p>I want to start a discussion about the idea of adding support for /etc/profile.d/</p><p>The idea goes that /etc/profile.d/ is a directory to drop shell files that are sourced near the end of the /etc/profile.</p><br /><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[...]

if [ -d /etc/profile.d/ ]
then for FILE in /etc/profile.d/*.sh
     do . ${FILE}
     done
fi</code></pre></div><p>The above is just an example implementation, and obviously could be achieved other ways.<br />The idea is to source all the .sh files in the /etc/profile.d/.<br />Other shells, namely [t]csh, could have another extension, say *.csh.</p><br /><p>What this brings is the ability of people to leave the version of /etc/profile unmodified from trunk/stable, and simply drop their customization into the profile.d dir.</p><p>This is already being done on my major Linux distro&#039;s and is generally considered a good idea.</p><p>So for people who build their own custom version of trunk they would not need to modify the default profile.<br />They would be able to globally override the defaults early in the files they drop in profile.d.</p><br /><br /><p>Please discuss.</p><p>Thanks :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>This thread is a bit old but I&#039;d also like to see something like this as I would like to add <strong>export ENV=$HOME/.ashrc</strong> to the shell environment so that <strong>~/.ashrc</strong> could be sourced on initial login for any user. ATM I have to manually edit /etc/profile itself.</p><p><strong>/etc/profile.d/</strong> is particularly useful for package installation so that new packages can automatically add special boot time shell requirements without user intervention.</p>									</div>
