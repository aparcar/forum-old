					<p>Hi Rick,</p><p>Thanks for your response.

The FCC could/would likely grant you a licence, did you apply for one. Improving communication with less power is what will be needed going forward as more and more devices clutter the airwaves.<br />2. You could reach out to some on this board via the private messaging system to allow messages to go to individuals. They MAY ask you to prove where you are; university or other or company.</p><p>If you are working on a system to automatically adjust the TX power for reliable communication; by default that would most likely reduce the power, BUT could move the power up and out of range, which could be allowed with an FCC licence.&nbsp; It needs to be known how often connections drop and wouldn&#039;t drop if there was more power.</p><p>The question then is IF the connection is poor; do you increase the power OR find another channel.</p><p>The FCC could allow emergency services to INCREASE POWER and us mere mortals to allow the system to find another channel or we get dumped.</p><p>Good luck,</p><p>Rick</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>RickStep</strong> on 13 Jan 2016, 00:00)</p>

But unless you are the edge router, you don&#039;t have any way of knowing what the WAN address (or addresses in some cases) are for your network.</p><p>If I have a modem from my ISP that gives me a 192.168.3.x address that I then plug the WAN port of my AP into, the AP is going to see 192.168.3.x, not the WAN address of my network. In business settings, it&#039;s extremely common for the APs to be connected to an internal network instead of directly to the WAN.</p><p>There are also ISPs that give people 10.x IP addresses as the WAN addresses of their home network and then do NAT inside the ISP to connect to the rest of the world.</p><p>If you try to find out by connecting to a server on the Internet and asking it what address it sees you comeing from, you still don&#039;t know your WAN address, because you may be getting there through a VPN. It would be easy to setup a VPN on the edge router that directs your traffic to some other country so that your &#039;WAN address&#039; shows up at that other country.</p><p>This is not a problem that technology can solve. Even if a GPS was installed in every AP, there would still be times when GPS signals are blocked and so a location can&#039;t be found.</p><p>It&#039;s also very possible to have layers of NAT so that you have an IP range inside your network that the wan port of your AP connects to that &#039;belongs&#039; to some other country, and then gets NATed to a IP range that&#039;s legal for your country. Doing so would make it so that there are 4 IP addresses on the Internet that you can&#039;t reach, but it&#039;s easy to pick ones that you don&#039;t care about (and change them if you find you do care)</p><p>Also, the prohibition against re-useing addresses isn&#039;t as solid as you are thinking. For example, Google&#039;s 8.8.8.8 DNS address exists in many different datacenters, in many different countries (search for anycast addresses for how and why people make use of a &#039;loophole&#039; in IP routing to legitimately use the same IP address multiple places in a network)</p>									</div>
