					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have a spare D-Link DIR-615 and hope to add a internal battery to allow me to use it as a router for a couple hours when I just have access to a Ethernet port or using it as a truly wireless repeater or bridge.&nbsp; The router runs on 5 volts 2.5 amps at peak so to run it for 5 hours I would need about 50 watts. If anybody has any ideas they would be greatly appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi benfriesen12;</p><p>Here is a cheap temporary solution I have used.<br />It requires a bit to work and using a good volt meter and ampmeter (10 amp full scale).</p><p>While the startup or short inrush current is higher I have measured the average operating current of a DIR-615 c1 and found it to average closer to 500 milliamps by itself.<br />If you do any modifications for example a usb mod and source current to devices on it then this average current could<br />be much higher.</p><p>The wall adapter can supply 5.12 volts at 2 amps. I have measured this voltage and it varies a bit.</p><p>Using 4 each rechargeable nickel metal hydride batteries each at&nbsp; 1.2 volts @ 1.3 AH (for example Sony EZ Find cell phone batteries) for a total of about 4.8 volts can be placed across the 5 volt adapter. <br />I use the rechargeable nickel metal hydride batteries only due to their availability, price, and power delivery.</p><p>The voltage on the battery will drift up to the voltage the 5 volt wall adapter potential.<br />It is best to measure the static voltage on this of a fully charged set of batteries and also the inrush current <br />on a set of discharged batteries.</p><p>Keep an eye on overheating or any safety issues.</p><p>This provides up to two hours of standard operation.</p><p>Some cautions to note; If these batteries run down excessively then the inrush could blow the fusing in the 5 volt power adapter so a smaller fuse in line with the battery is recommended.</p><p>Hope this information helps but as they say if you make it then you can bake it (fry your device).</p><p>~john</p>									</div>
