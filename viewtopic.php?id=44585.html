					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve set up two WDR3600s up in WDS mode (AP-STA), and wanted the client station to repeat the wireless signal of the master access point.</p><p>I followed the steps in these recipes for implementing relayd, and then restarted the client station:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient</a><br /><a href="http://trac.gateworks.com/wiki/relayd">http://trac.gateworks.com/wiki/relayd</a></p><p>The client station reports relayd as running, and all interfaces as being up. I can see packets flowing in the interfaces section of luci.</p><p>However, how can I tell that the client station is offering a secondary, repeated access point?</p><p>I&#039;ve tried surveying the wireless access points using the following tool, but only found the master AP:</p><p><a href="http://tools.meraki.com/stumbler#q=">http://tools.meraki.com/stumbler#q=</a></p><p>I&#039;ve used broadcom WDS before, and surveying the site with those repeaters shows the SSID of each router (uniquely identified by their MAC). Is Atheros WDS + relayd different? Will the client station&#039;s repeated SSID be masked?</p><p>I found it strange that there&#039;s no configuration of the client station as an AP in the recipe steps. Is there something missing?</p><p>Any help much appreciated.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sunkai</strong> on 6 Jun 2013, 18:37)</p>

					<p>This forum post has a extra &quot;wifi-iface&quot; block in the &quot;/etc/config/wireless/&quot; file, detailing an AP on the same radio as the STA:</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39077">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39077</a></p><p>Do I need to use relayd at all?

					<p>Thanks again jow.</p><p>I was confused by the description of Atheros WDS on the wiki, which I interpreted as not supporting the simultaneous use of a radio to create a routed client, and an AP repeater.</p><p>In fact, only the routed client mode is supported inherently when Atheros WDS is enabled (unlike Broadcom WDS, which inherently provides both roles). However, an additional AP can be manually added to the client, on the same radio (which can have the same SSID and encryption as the master, &quot;repeating&quot; it).</p><p>From the diagram on the wiki, it looked like the additional AP would require &quot;relayd&quot; to operate, but that&#039;s not the case. In fact, if you follow the relayd recipe, you don&#039;t even get an AP on the client, so the diagram is misleading.</p><p>Sorted.</p>									</div>
