					<p>The default ones. For releases Luci GUI is included, but otherwise it is plain defaults also there. <br />See example of 15.05.1 release config: <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05.1/ar71xx/generic/config.diff">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal … onfig.diff</a></p><p>(buildbot trunk snapshots do not include Luci, as that is not included by default)</p><p>Starting with and empty .config and selecting your device will give you the same options for the package inclusion and possible settings. </p><p>The same goes for individual packages, both snapshots and releases are compiled with the defaults in the source repo.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your message,<br />So I need to be more specific.</p><p>I&#039;m trying to rebuild coova-chilli from 15.05. The problem is that the options used to compile coova-chilli depend on whether or not another package is selected into menuconfig or not (ipt-coova).</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>$(if $(CONFIG_COOVACHILLI_MATRIXSSL),--with,--without)-matrixssl \

					<div class="quotebox"><cite>pparent wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>In this case how can I know what options was really used?</p></blockquote></div><p>The basic starting point is that defaults are used. Other options like they are in <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/packages/blob/master/net/coova-chilli/Config.in">https://github.com/openwrt/packages/blo … /Config.in</a></p><p>Regarding that one dependency to a kernel module, snapshots and release builds are made with &quot;build all modules&quot;, which leads to that kmod-ipt-coova being present in the build, and I think that it will lead into enabling that option in coova&#039;s Makefile. Not quite sure, though.</p>									</div>

					<p>It should also be noted that the kmod-ipt-coova is completely useless without coova-chilli built without --with-nfcoova. So if this option is not included in default built, then the package ipt-coova is not usefull in openwrt.</p><p>But if coova-chilli is built with the --with-nfcoova option then it should not work without the ipt-coova package. Since it works without it, I guess that it was compiled without --with-nfcoova option.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pparent</strong> on 31 May 2016, 15:54)</p>
