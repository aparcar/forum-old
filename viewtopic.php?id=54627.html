					<p>Hi people,</p><p>I&#039;ve got several &quot;inherited&quot; Intellinet 300N Wireless Dual-Band Routers, which I&#039;d like to put to some use, be it at least to broaden the hardware support of OpenWrt.</p><p>It&#039;s got a Ralink RT3352F SoC (&quot;router on a chip&quot;) (<a href="https://wikidevi.com/files/Ralink/RT3352%20product%20brief.pdf">brief</a>) as a mainboard with a MIPS 24K @400MHz, a Macronix <a href="http://www.macronix.com/en-us/Product/Pages/ProductDetail.aspx?PartNo=MX25L3206E">MX25L3206E</a> 4MB flash, Winbond <a href="http://www.winbond.com.tw/NR/rdonlyres/16898431-2772-4CEA-8474-7E4AA855555F/0/W9825G6JH.pdf">W9825G6JH-6</a> 16MB RAM and a <a href="https://wikidevi.com/files/Ralink/RT3572%20product%20brief.pdf">RT3572L</a> for the 5GHz capability.</p><p>The board looks very similar to the <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=161607#p161607">DIR-615 rev. H2</a> (spare for the RT3572 part, and configuration-wise remarkably similar to the <a href="https://wikidevi.com/wiki/D-Link_DIR-815_rev_B1">DIR-815 rev. B1</a> (same SoC, same daughterboard).</p><p>I&#039;ve tried uploading the <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ramips/rt305x/openwrt-ramips-rt305x-dir-615-h1-squashfs-factory.bin">DIR-615 H1 build</a>, but the web interface says it doesn&#039;t recognize it and tftp-ing the firmware (via 192.168.1.6, by pressing RST while plugging the box in) is ignored as well, though the image is transferred.</p><p>I&#039;d really appreciate any pointers on doing so myself and/or would also be willing to donate one of my routers, if someone would be willing to create a build (i.e. probably just reconfigure the existing DIR-615 build).</p><p>I&#039;ve uploaded some pics and theres more info about the box on <a href="https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Intellinet_300N_Wireless_Dual-Band_Router">wikidevi</a>.</p><p>Edit:<br />The Edimax product page lists a firmware image as well as the source code (which, unfortunately is not downloadable) at <a href="http://www.edimax.com/edimax/download/download/data/edimax/global/download/for_home/home_legacy_products/home_legacy_wireless_routers/br-6435nd">http://www.edimax.com/edimax/download/d â€¦ /br-6435nd</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>geotti</strong> on 18 Dec 2014, 05:14)</p>

					<p>Interesting there&#039;s space on the board for a second RAM chip (which you&#039;re definitely going to want) and two front panel external USB ports.&nbsp; Must be some sort of hub chip in there, as I thought the SoC has only one USB port.</p><p>Get into the bootlaoder with serial console.&nbsp; Try to figure out the flash partitioning, it is often the main incompatibilty between models.&nbsp; Most have the firmware start at block 5.&nbsp; (blocks 0-2 u-Boot, block 3 u-Boot config, block 4 &#039;factory&#039; : MAC addresses and wifi parameters).</p><p>You can also build yourself a ramdisk uImage for the prospective surrogate model, tftp it to RAM and see if it will boot at all-- this does not modify the flash.</p><p>The 5 GHz chip being a USB device you can probably just install the appropriate drivers as if it were an external USB wifi stick.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 18 Dec 2014, 06:05)</p>
