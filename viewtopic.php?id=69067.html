					<p>I have become stuck now with IP rules / forwarding I think<br />Details:<br />VPN Server hosted on IP 192.168.0.126:1194 on a LEDE cisco MR12<br />Wifi is disabled. Only one Ethernet connection to the device. (192.168.0.0 255.255.255.0)<br />VPN Server is 10.1.0.0 255.255.255.240<br />Two interfaces on host<br />Name = VPN / Interface = tun0 (virtual interface as made in wiki)<br />Name = LAN / Interface = br-lan (But I can also see that there is a eth0 with ifconfig command but it has no assigned IP)<br />WAN is out via 192.168.0.1 on my separate router ao I have no WAN zone set on the Cisco. <br />I have set my router IP Table so I am able to ping 10.1.0.1 from my pc 192.168.0.22</p><p>I connect from my remote device to the vpn fine with no errors in the logs but get not response from ping to 10.1.0.1 or 192.168.0.1 networks. I think I have something basic set wrong but can&#039;t figure it out.I have uploaded a copy of my firewall, openvpn client and server settings to pastebin. pastebin.com/X9nWAWUu<br />If anyone has&nbsp; moment to check what I have wrong it would be most appreciated.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Presjar</strong> on 23 Dec 2016, 23:14)</p>
