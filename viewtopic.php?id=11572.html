					<p>Dear All,</p><p>I run OpenWrt (whiterussian) on my WRT54GL v1.1. For some experiments I want to set the physical rate to a fixed value, e.g., always use 54 Mbps and do switch to lower rates. How can I do that?</p><p>Additionally, I want to experiment a little bit with the number or retransmissions that are performed at the link layer. Normally, this can be set by <br />iwconfig device retry N</p><p>However, this doesn&#039;t seem to work. </p><p>Best Regards,<br />Ingo</p>									</div>
