					<p>I want to let my client use a flash drive to pull out and put in his computer to set the SSID in a text file named &quot;ssid.txt&quot;. Then upon sticking it back into the router, and reboot, it picks up this name and uses it. Possible? </p><p>More: I am wanting a very easy way for my client to change the open Wi-Fi name and this seems easier and more direct than having them log in and do it. If I put the name in a text file sitting on the USB flash drive ( which they will leave in the router ), it can simply be rebooted, pickup the new/changed SSID and then work. They&#039;ll take that flash drive out and edit the file directly naming it whatever they want and I don&#039;t have to intervene or be troubled. This is my plan. </p><p>Note: I am a n00b ( first forum post ) at OpenWRT but have some exp. with DOS batch files and some terminal exp on OSX.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>usermac</strong> on 14 Apr 2013, 22:01)</p>

					<p>Why does the client need to change ssids? Why not just keep the same one always?<br />If you want to do this for a variety of routers then you need root access for them all. If you already have this, why not just fix them all once?<br />The way you suggest seems very insecure to me.<br />If you only want to &quot;fix&quot; them all once, you will still need to access each router at least once to add some sort of script to get the job done, so why not just edit the ssid then, instead.</p>									</div>

					<p>You can&#039;t change the ssid without logging in.<br />You could write a one-click-script for his PC that logs in and changes it for him.<br />If it was possible to do what you want, then anyone could do it. That&#039;s the point of having to log in: it authenticates the person trying to modify the router.</p>									</div>

You can run &quot;uci show wireless&quot; to determine the right section specific to your router.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>phuque99</strong> on 15 Apr 2013, 10:45)</p>

					<p>Thank you @phuque99 as I just got my router in over the weekend. I put your code in System &gt; Startup &gt; Local Startup section but one part seems to not work and that is the line that starts with &quot; -f&quot;: <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># Mount the usb
cd /mnt/usb

uci set wireless.@wifi-iface[0].ssid=&#039;cat /home/wifiname.txt&#039;
# Commit the change
uci commit wireless
# Drop wireless to stop old name
/sbin/wifi down
# Bring up the wireless to use the new name
