					<p>Hello everyone,<br />I&#039;am working on creating a mesh network using openwrt. Iam trying to create the following topology but iam unable to do this. </p><p> node1&lt;--5GHz--&gt;node2&lt;--5GHz--&gt;node3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; 2.4GHz&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.4GHz&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.4GHz<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; clients&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; clients&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;clients</p><p>Here nodes have dual band support. These nodes must be wirelessly interconected at 5GHz frequency. The client to individual node must be wirelessly connected at 2.4GHz frequency. Every node and client must talk to each other directly or indirectly.<br />Any help regarding this would be appreciated.</p><p>Thank you</p>									</div>

					<p>I tried with mesh mode but its not working. I even tried connecting all the nodes using wds but wds is not&nbsp; working at 5GHz. I am using Atheros ap135 reference board. The board does support mesh mode</p><p>Thank you</p>									</div>
