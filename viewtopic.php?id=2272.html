					<p>you need a hard drive to do that. I use an usb2 hard drive.<br />mldonkey uses more than 40 meg of ram and takes LOT of cpu ressource.</p><p>I&#039;ve finally setup a real pc instead of my router because the asus hardware is much too slow for such applications.<br />1mbyte/s on samba was not enough for me.</p>									</div>

					<p>I know,but i can use SD card HW mod and connect SD/MMC card and it is seen as /mmc directory. My linksys has 200MHz and 32MB of RAM. You said that mldonkey uses 40MB of RAM, and I don&#039;t understand because AFAIK Asus wl500 has 16 or 32 MB depending on model...<br />I asked you for binary because asus and linksys has similar MIPSEL processor and, I hope, it can be executed od my linksys.</p>									</div>

					<p>The binary is not statically linked and is compiled under debian, and I don&#039;t know what are the dependencies with the debian libraries.<br />I think there is something with ld.so to have the list of shared libraries...<br />I could try to configure it so it is statically linked, I will try.</p><p>I simply use a swap partition to make it run on 32mb of ram.<br />I think I would not recommend swapping on a SD card... You need performance to do that.</p><p>I think you should follow the link above and install a debian.</p>									</div>

					<p>you may need a mass storage. the asus has an usb port on which I connect my hard drive.</p><p>I cannot give you the binary because it is debian dynamically linked.</p><p>You need to install the debian then compile mldonkey.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sophana</strong> on 2 Apr 2006, 13:58)</p>

					<p>As I said I have SD mod and I can connect 1GB or bigger SD/MMC card so I think it is sufficient to mldonkey instalation and for one or two Divx downloads <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />maybe <strong>amule</strong> client will be more suitable for WRT54GS?

					<p>I had a look at amule. The problem I found is that it has a gui, and I don&#039;t know if you can run it without it.<br />Why don&#039;t you install a debian and compile as suggested?<br />I&#039;m not sure this kind of big software will compile easily in openwrt.

					<p>Maybe it would be useful to take a look to their package compilation process.<br />I gave up using my openwrt router as it was a bit slow in interaction (although it did download quite fast). As I needed other permanent services, I finally used a real old PC to do the job. So I can&#039;t help a lot.<br />Actualy, openwrt is working as a hotspot (with chillispot)</p>									</div>
