					<p>Hello everyone. Recently I´ve noticed that my WiFi isnt working to it´s full potential. </p><p>Model&nbsp; &nbsp; TP-Link TL-WR1043N/ND v3<br />Firmware Version&nbsp; &nbsp; OpenWrt Designated Driver 49876 / LuCI Master (git-16.213.50409-1367f7b)<br />Kernel Version&nbsp; &nbsp; 4.4.14</p><p>Is what Im using. For months after installing it I had full internet speed on WiFi (50 mbit/s down and 15 mbit/s up). But recently, without changing anything to my settings, I´ve &quot;only&quot; been getting 20 mbit/s of down speed.</p><p>So I fiddled about with the wifi settings. Disabled scanning. 20/40 Hz channels legacy or n mode you name it. </p><p>I remember using this version, because with another stable snapshot (cant remember which) I had no wfif at all. So someone on the forums suggested that one. And it worked you so I stayed with that one.</p><p>Any kind of help and suggestions are appreciated.</p>									</div>
