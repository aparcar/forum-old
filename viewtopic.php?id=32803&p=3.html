					<p>The Whitebox needs data to determine when it is &quot;clear to send&quot;.</p><p>If the Whitebox measures while there is other internet traffic at the same time this produces flawed measurements.</p><p>So the two data sources it considers are 1. routed packets that flow through its own ports and 2. packet count of the strongest 2.4GHz wireless network in the vicinity. If either of the two rises above a hardcoded threshold the Whitebox suspends measurements until 5 minutes later. Now if these data are not valid, as in my case due to my network setup, or because you wipe them out, then you are submitting wrong measurements that indicate ISP problems where there might be none. This introduces noise in the aggregate data and is not fair play.</p><p>Anyhow, can you install an SNMP daemon on your internet router?</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok then. Here’s a vanilla trunk firmware for 741NDv1 with the Samknows ispmon package discussed above compiled in: <a href="ftp://ftp.tuebingen.mpg.de/pub/kyb/towolf/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr741nd-v1-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin">openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr741nd-v1-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin</a>. </p><p>If you want to use the radio for something else and still report traffic, you have to run an SNMP server on your internet router. Edit the variables at the top of the /usr/bin/snmpcap.sh script to point to your router and enter the proper OID variables. I couldn’t include the MIB files because there’s only 4M of space on the box. It’s just a simple script that snmpget’s the up- and downstream traffic and determines if the threshold for measurements is exceeded.</p><p>Now that I think about it you could have installed trunk on your own and added the samknows package later.</p><p>Be aware that the uboot on this box has no reachable tftp failsafe, so if the flash goes wrong you have to break out the soldering iron.</p><p>No Warranty implied. I hope you can work it out.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>towolf</strong> on 15 Aug 2012, 02:57)</p>

					<p>Greetings.</p><p>I have a samknows wr741nd and went ahead to flash openwrt, hoping to get the samknows package working.

					<p>Hey guys, </p><p>I think I have just bricked my whitebox, I am quite interested in doing the SNMP mod to the whitebox so it can pull the current usage from my ASA. </p><p>I looked and couldn&#039;t find an SNMP package that you didn&#039;t have to compile manually so the snmpget command was avalable. So decided to download the fimware that tomwolf kindly uploaded here <a href="ftp://ftp.tuebingen.mpg.de/pub/kyb/towolf/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr741nd-v1-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin">ftp://ftp.tuebingen.mpg.de/pub/kyb/towo … pgrade.bin</a> <br />I then flashed my whitebox 741nd with it and now it doesn&#039;t seem to boot all of the lights flash on and off excluding the power light. have I bricked it and if so is it recoverable. </p><p>Its a version 4.x if that is any help.</p><p>thanks</p>									</div>
