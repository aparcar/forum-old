					<p>Well a few days ago my router, configured as a bridge (used to connect my DirecTv IRD to the internet), loaded with dd-wrt 24 mini, started acting flaky and then died.&nbsp; After a few days I plugged it in again to troubleshoot and the power LED flashed non-stop.&nbsp; So I did some surfing and here&#039;s what I have done to date in an attempt to correct the problem:</p><p>One thing to note: The port leds light (coresponding to the port I&#039;m plugged into) when a cable is connected and do show activity when I ping the device.</p><p>1.&nbsp; Reseting wiht the PB fails.<br />2.&nbsp; No ping to the router, including when I set the connection to 10/half duplex.<br />3.&nbsp; I made a JTAG and installed a header.&nbsp; I have used wrt54g.exe to backup the whole flash, cfe.bin, and kernel.bin.<br />4.&nbsp; I cleared the NVRAM several times, not fixed.<br />5.&nbsp; I erased and flashed the linksys firmware as kernel.bin, not fixed.<br />6.&nbsp; I erased and flashed with a cfe.bin (proper version for my router) I grabbed from some site, not fixed.<br />7.&nbsp; I erased and flased cfe.bin created with Skynet Repair Kit v1.5, not fixed.<br />8.&nbsp; I erased the kernel and NVRAM, not fixed.<br />9.&nbsp; I am currently loading wrt-dd mini std 24 but don&#039;t have high hopes of it fixing the problem.</p><p>The power led always flashes when power is applied and I understand this to mean the bootloader failed.&nbsp; I did try to do my homework but I can&#039;t seem to get any further.&nbsp; Any advice beside tossing it in the garbage would be nice.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Joe</p>									</div>

					<p>Have the same problem. What happens when you flash cfe and then reconnect the ethernet cable and then ping it. I get some really unusual pings.

It&#039;s like the flash chip is fryed and doesn&#039;t want to hold the firmware.

					<p>I will probably just focus on CFE /Redboot.<br />I may try couple of different versions of Redboot but that&#039;s it and leave the rest of kernel and nvram stuff.</p><p>And I will write and read and do the binary comparison to ensure if it worked. I wouldn&#039;t waste time on writing all 1&#039;s. If the binary comparison passes you are good to go. Also make sure you are erasing the flash block before writing.</p><p>After that I will power cycle with a good 1 minute to make sure any oddity on reset register and memory is all cleared to default. </p><p>I don&#039;t know if Redboot uses nvram to access the Ram. There was something about specifying the ram&#039;s cols x width x banks on some of the chips.</p><p>Good luck!</p>									</div>

					<p>I also had a brick with the linksys wrt54g v2 and the green powerled blinking. I could still flash apparantly the linksys firmware. But the problem remained.</p><p>The i changed the power supply for a new one with the same specifations - 12V 1 A - and the powerled burnt constantly, problem solved.</p>									</div>
