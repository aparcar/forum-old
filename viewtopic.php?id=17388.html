					<p>OK, I&#039;ve been watching OpenWrt for a while in the hope that I can do something useful with a spare DG834v4 (bcm6348). I see on the News Forum (<a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=17370">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=17370</a>) that this target is now available (thanks guys!) so I&#039;ve followed the instructions to checkout the trunk (rev 13011) and attempted to configure it.</p><p>However, there&#039;s no option to configure for the BCM 963xx target system in make config/menuconfig. The option is definitely present in the .config file (as &quot;# CONFIG_TARGET_brcm63xx is not set&quot;) and the target/linux/brcm63xx directory exists.</p><p>I&#039;ve a feeling I&#039;m missing something blindingly obvious but I&#039;ve been reading and rereading the various build and installation docs and trying various things but I&#039;m getting nowhere. Can anyone give me a clue as to what I might be doing wrong before I give up and report as a bug and probably get flamed to a crisp?</p><p>Mike</p>									</div>
