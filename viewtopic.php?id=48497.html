If the DHCP works, it just assigns an IP address.

					<p>Massive thanks , Mijzelf - nice to know you&#039;re not alone . <br />Thank you for your time. </p><p>What i meant was that i scanned those ranges - no activity there.<br />DHCP seams not to getting up. :-/ I want to find the source for the sysupgrade binary so that i could get an idea what to expect .<br />Looking at the LEDs it seams as if there&#039;s got to be a process of some kind going on . But whether there should be a failsafe option or not - i can not tell - from here <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/belkin/f5d8235-4">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/belkin/f5d8235-4</a> all i can tell is that - there&#039;s got to be an awfully small time frame in which the router listens on telnet. </p><p>If serial is the only solution - damn . stupid mistake - bad luck choosing the binary . </p><p>Could someone say whether there is failsafe after flashing directly an SYSUPGRADE&nbsp; ???</p>									</div>

					<p>The rt8366s switch doesn&#039;t work in 12.09 branch. You must open the case following instruction&nbsp; <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=21998,">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=21998,</a> then solder console pins as described <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/belkin/f5d8235-4.">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/belkin/f5d8235-4.</a> After that you should be able get boot loader prompt and flash last original firmware f5d8235v1_ww_1.01.28.bin via tftp, but before that you need to cut firmware header with hexeditor to 27 05 19. I hope this help you de brick this router.</p>									</div>

					<p>But mine router is probably the very first version - v1 with Ralink RT2880 - relying on separate wireless and switch.??<br />it is this one <a href="https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Belkin_F5D8235-4_v1">https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Belkin_F5D8235-4_v1</a> . based, i think on RT2880 ?</p><p>And what gave me wings : <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09-beta/ramips/rt288x/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_a … ps/rt288x/</a> <br />here it is - the&nbsp; 12.09 beta version with the very model listed . the very version one . and it has a custom upgrade file ??</p><p>It must work , am i right ? Does this change anything&nbsp; or is the braking and soldering of things the only way to go about it ?</p><p>I thought it should work with this particular openwrt version 12.09&nbsp; -beta .<br />Now i don&#039;t know how to go for the serial pins - here they should be somehow - top left corner &quot;J6&quot; but i&#039;m not sure. :S <a href="https://wikidevi.com/w/images/c/c7/Belkin_F5D8235-4_v1_board_top.jpg">https://wikidevi.com/w/images/c/c7/Belk … rd_top.jpg</a><br />There are no pins soldered as it could be seen on this one <a href="http://download.dsmg600.info/people/sala/F5D8235-4/serial/belkin_nplus_board.jpg">http://download.dsmg600.info/people/sal … _board.jpg</a> . </p><p>Thank you in advance !</p>									</div>
