					<p>I thought I would put this note up - in case there is anyone else like me trying to get a Dlink dir-835 working.&nbsp; I started out with dd-wrt as they have emerging support for this model - but I couldn&#039;t get vlan&#039;s working to my satisfaction.&nbsp; In doing this I came across details stating that the Dlink dir-825 rev C1 is architecturally similar to the dir-835 rev A1.</p><p>I&#039;ve deployed OpenWrt Barrier Breaker r35412 / LuCI Trunk (trunk+svn9663) for D-Link DIR-825 rev. C1 and am happy to report great success!</p><p>I am further able to say that I managed to get the vlan configuration which I originally wanted which is trunking from my basement switch (2 vlans) and 2 ssid&#039;s advertised on both radio&#039;s each ssid in one of the 2 vlan&#039;s (basically a dual band access point with support for multiple ssid across vlans)</p><p>So:<br />home vlan with 2.4ghz home ssid and 5.8ghz home ssid <br />work vlan with 2.4ghz work ssid and 5.8ghz work ssid</p><p>The vlan config wasn&#039;t directly achievable from luci - I was able to finish things off using a combination of web gui and swconfig at the shell.</p><p>Thanks whoever is working on the Atheros stuff in the trunk!!!&nbsp; you rock!</p>									</div>

					<p>Greetings OpenWRT Community,</p><p>Inspired by tcrisall&#039;s initial post I decided to give it a go.</p><p>Here is what I have come up with:</p><p>I picked up a DIR-835 and flashed it with the Feb 9th build of&nbsp; barrier breaker for the DIR 825-C1 (squashfs)]. (I don&#039;t see why the current one wouldn&#039;t work.)</p><p>Only the internal WPS light indicated after the initial install (I setup a few others once I got luci up and running).</p><p>In order to remote into the router I had to use a static IP (192.168.1.100). (I cant remember if this was true for telnet but it was for SSH.) I was unable reach the internet.</p><p>Initially the Ethernet port labeled 4 on the back didn&#039;t work and when you plugged into the WAN port you were given a DHCP address.&nbsp; ^_^&nbsp; </p><p>After monkeying around with it for a bit I found which ports in the network configuration needed to get switched around.</p><p>Here is the original switch configuration (see /etc/config/network):<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config switch_vlan
        option device &#039;eth0&#039;
        option vlan &#039;1&#039;
        option ports &#039;0t 2 3 4 5&#039;

config switch_vlan
        option device &#039;eth0&#039;
        option vlan &#039;2&#039;
        option ports &#039;0t 1&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Here is what worked for me:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config switch_vlan
        option device &#039;eth0&#039;
        option vlan &#039;1&#039;
        option ports &#039;0t 1 2 3 4&#039;

config switch_vlan
        option device &#039;eth0&#039;
        option vlan &#039;2&#039;
        option ports &#039;0t 5&#039;</code></pre></div><p>After that my Ethernet ports started handing out IP addresses correctly and the WAN port gets me to the internet I was able to opkg the luci web interface, turn on the Wi-Fi and that is about as far as I have got at the moment. </p><p>I still don&#039;t understand how everything works entirely, so I am not sure if this is correct but it working for me. This is my first time using OpenWRT and my first deeper dive into Linux. It has been allot of frustrating fun learning about all this... </p><p>I am not longer afraid of vim <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" />,</p><p>Good Luck</p><p>[Edit: (Feb. 12) Just cleaning up a little]</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ajpasic</strong> on 12 Feb 2013, 05:16)</p>

					<p>Just to clarify, before the fix above, the WAN port was acting like one of the LAN ports. I was still able to remote in using a static IP from three of the lan ports. The WAN light didn&#039;t blink it was the WPS led tucked under the WPS button. It would flash while booting and be solid when on. If you tap the reset button while it is flashing it goes into one of the OpenWRT recovery modes.</p><p>AS I understand it, on a physical level it is all one switch but it gets partitioned virtually in the /etc/config/network file.</p><p>This is for the DIR-835. For the DIR-825 C-1 the lights may be different. </p><p>I never completely wrapped my head around these two articles but was able to figure it out mainly from these three links:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Primarily: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network/switch">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network/switch</a><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/internal.layout">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/internal.layout</a><br />Good general info: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/networking/network.interfaces">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/networking/ … interfaces</a></p><p>[Edit] I dumped the UCI code from the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-825?s#repair.leds.after.flashing.openwrt">repair LEDs</a> section for the DIR-825 into the console and tweaked it a bit once I got luci up and running. However, I was only able&nbsp; figured out how to get the WAN light to blink on and off. [/Edit]</p><p>Good Luck.</p><p>P.S.&nbsp; I was able to deduce the following ports by turning them on and off:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Back of router:  WAN | LAN1 | LAN2 | LAN3 | LAN4
Port:             5  |  4   |  3   |  2   |  1     </code></pre></div><p>Which leads me to believe port 0t is the back end port as seen on the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network/switch">switch</a> page. (I am guessing that is what the &#039;t&#039; flag denotes.)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ajpasic</strong> on 13 Feb 2013, 01:18)</p>
