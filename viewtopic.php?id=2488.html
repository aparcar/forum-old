					<p>When trying to use lighttpd mod_rewrite and/or mod_redirect, they complain about missing pcre support (even though pcre is installed).<br />The problem is that the lighttpd configure script doesn&#039;t define HAVE_PCRE_H (which is checked for in src/mod_rewrite.c).</p><p>The culprit in the source is</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>if test &quot;x$cross_compiling&quot; = xno; then
  [ ... check for PCRE ... ]
fi</code></pre></div><p>In short, &quot;Check for PCRE only if we aren&#039;t crosscompiling; if we are, we don&#039;t have it.&quot;</p><p>The PCRE_LIB= setting in the ipkg makefile isn&#039;t sufficient because it does&#039;t set HAVE_PCRE_H, which is checked for in the source.<br />A quick (and crude but effective <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> ) hack would be adding</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>AC_DEFINE([HAVE_PCRE_H], [1], [Use PCRE])
AC_DEFINE([HAVE_LIBPCRE], [1], [Use PCRE])</code></pre></div><p>to lighttpd&#039;s configure.in.</p><p>While at it, lighttpd 1.4.2 is out w/ loads of bugfixes, the package should probably be updated.</p><p>I&#039;ve uploaded a patch to current OpenWRT CVS (doing both the fix and update) is to <a href="http://www.arklinux.org/~bero/openwrt-lighttpd.patch">http://www.arklinux.org/~bero/openwrt-lighttpd.patch</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bero</strong> on 31 Aug 2005, 18:26)</p>
