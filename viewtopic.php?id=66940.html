					<p>Hello,</p><p>I bought this TP-link today and tried to give the official firmware a go. There was a bug preventing me to change router IP so I decided to upgrade firmware to a new version Archer C7(EU)_V2_160616. The bug was still there so I decided to go with the OpenWrt. But hell. Following the standard procedure to upgrade it refuses to accept the OpenWrt firmware.</p><p>Reviewing the release notes of the oficial firmware there is a red note:<br />- The EU firmware was specialized for CE certification and can&#039;t be downgraded to other version, please click here for choosing your region and selecting the most suitable firmware version to upgrade.</p><p>So what now? <br />How fucked am I?<br />I already wrote to TP-link support and will see what the reaction will be.</p><p>--</p><p>- I tried renaming the .bin filename<br />- I tried the &quot;dd&quot; to remove blocks<br />- I tried the TFTP downgrade, but with no luck.</p><p>What else can I try to force this newest official firmware to upgrade itself to OpenWrt?</p><p>Thank you</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok. I tried the TFTP solution again and it worked.</p><p>This time I monitored the ethernet interface to confirm that the firmware was requested and being uploaded.<br />sudo tcpdump ether host 40:6c:8f:12:53:99</p><p>And I can confirm that It was looking for ArcherC7v2_tp_recovery.bin file.</p><p>I first recovered the official firmware to the previous version Archer C7_V2_150427 which doesn&#039;t have the firmware image header checking. And then I simply uploaded the lastest OpenWrt 15.15.1 via Web interface without any problems.</p><p>Thank you both for suggestions.</p><p>P.S. I&#039;m not sure what I did wrong the last time, maybe my TFTP server wasn&#039;t running propertly.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey</p><p>My Archer C7 v2 is either bricked (probably not), or it has some kind of new firmware checking protection.</p><p>This is an european version, s/n starts with 215B4, I bought it a month ago.<br />I&#039;ve had issues with LAN stability and DHCP, so I upgraded the firmware to the latest, Archer C7(EU)_V2_160616, which of course didn&#039;t help. <br />I couldn&#039;t flash any firmware through the web interface, so I&#039;ve tried TFTP, and it worked. (192.168.0.66, &quot;ArcherC7v2_tp_recovery.bin&quot;) I uploaded one of the openwrt firmwares (I don&#039;t even remember which, it was 255+ firmwares ago), but then it got into a bootloop.</p><p>Thankfully, TFTP recovery still works, but NONE of the available firmwares were able to get it out of the bootloop.<br />The images finish uploading, then it restarts and everything is the same.<br />Things I&#039;ve tried: multiple ddwrt versions (latest, older, some which were considered stable by people), original firmwares, even the latest, which was working before bootloop (yes, I&#039;ve tried 150427 too), I of course cut the bootloader part of the files properly, I&#039;ve tried without cutting, too. But i&#039;ve tried the stripped versions too. Multiple openwrt versions too.</p><p>It&#039;s like I&#039;m doing nothing, it&#039;s always the same, it downloads the file, reboots and bootloop.</p><p>I&#039;m completely out of ideas. I think I&#039;ve read every Archer C7 threads on the internet, but people usually only have problem with setting up TFTP properly, but that works for me (or it looks like it, it resquests the file, then completes the download).</p><p>Any ideas what I&#039;m doing wrong?</p><p>EDIT1: marakoss, could you send me the .bin file which you had luck with?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>yoshileon</strong> on 1 Sep 2016, 00:25)</p>

					<p>yoshileon: Focus on getting the original firmware back (first). Double-check you version. Can you confirm that the file was really uploaded to router (like watching the communication using tcpdump) ? Confirm that the firmware file isn&#039;t corrupted (hash)? DO NOT cut the bootloader part of the official firmware. </p><p>If all above fails you are left with hardwiring the serial interface - to see whats wrong during boot.</p><br /><p>I&#039;ve used the original firmware (the one previous of the EU update):</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>h t t p : / / static tp-link com /res/down/soft/Archer_C7_v2_150427.zip</code></pre></div><p>and then this standard OpenWrt release:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>h t t p s : / /downloads openwrt org /chaos_calmer/15.05.1/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-15.05.1-ar71xx-generic-archer-c7-v2-squashfs-factory.bin</code></pre></div><p>[note: I had to take out the parts of the url so the system would let me send them. Sorry for that]</p><br /><p>I Hope you resolve the issue.</p><p>Best wishes.</p>									</div>

Heh<br />I&#039;ll try if everything else fails, but I don&#039;t have any equipment, and even less experience. I&#039;m afraid I&#039;ll f* up the soldering then I&#039;ll have a brand new expensive brick.<br />I have serial pinout on the pc mobo, so I might be able to make it happen without an usb rs232 though.</p>									</div>
