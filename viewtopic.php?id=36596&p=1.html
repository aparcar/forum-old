But be careful - you can use it even for changing headers of Open-WRT and DD-WRT firmwares, but it&#039;s your job to make sure the firmware that you are modding is same or similar hardware - or else you will most-likely manage to flash it but will brick your router! <br /><span style="color: red">Then to repair it you will need de/soldering skills and programmer!!!

					<p>Hi mveplus!</p><p>I&#039;m very glad to find this post - I was wondering have you had any success in converting Mercury products from Chinese to English? The reason is ask is because I have a Mercury MW150R - Right now I want to see if I can switch it out of Chinese mode into English. It looks EXACTLY like this TP-LINK router (rounded chassis): <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr740n">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr740n</a> in fact I found out that my Mercury MW150R, the TP-LINK WR7409 and FAST &lt;something&gt; are exactly the same! I&#039;ve tried to use your tool to edit all values (including the long string below 0x40-0x43 but I keep getting this error: ?????18005<br />????????????? - Any help you can provide will be highly appreciated! I look forward to your response!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>weej</strong> on 26 Jul 2012, 08:21)</p>

					<p>Hi Mveplus </p><p>First of all BIG BIG thank you for conversion - I forgot to say this :-)<br />My only concern was I got different results with TP????<br />By different I meant result of fc command on the PC :&nbsp; fc /b firmware1 firmware2<br />Where firmware1 is firmware from Tplink site converted by me with TP????? program and firmware2 is from your archive.<br />So: <br />For 3020 Tplink firmware fc command shows NO differences to WR703_CH_MR3020Nv1_EN_up(120320)_Webflash.bin<br />For 703n Tplink firmware fc shows differences to Revert_Back_EN_MR3020Nv1_to_CH_WR703Nv1_webflash.bin<br />I thought can I &quot;produce&quot; revert firmware with TP????? program ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>etan</strong> on 26 Jul 2012, 13:42)</p>

HOW TO FLASH OEM TL-MR3040 FIRMWARE<br />Please give me some time to test how it will work, otherwise you are flashing on your own risk<br />Thanks to Sin for posting firmware file and Lcdx for reupload it to english website.<br />I have TL_MR11U v2 and was able to flash it to usual TL-MR3040 firmware. Below a short instruction. Files available by link below. <br />1. Flash from Chinese firmware to OpenWRT</p><p>OpenWrt for TL-MR11U v2</p><p><a href="http://uploaded.net/file/2tsiskq1">http://uploaded.net/file/2tsiskq1</a>&nbsp; . </p><p>2. Login to your router and change root password to enable SSH.<br />3. Run webserver on your PC and share TL-MR3040 firmware. (Run HFS from archive, Menu - Add files - and choose TL-MR3040 firmware. Copy http adress from string in program )<br />4. Run putty. Connect to your router by entering router IP adress - default 192.168.1.1 choose SSH, default port is 22. and press Open<br />5. Login as root. Enter your password. <br />6. Enter commands &quot;cd /tmp&quot;<br />7. &quot;wget http://YOUR_PC_IP/FIRMWARE_NAME.bin&quot; (from HFS)<br />8. &quot;mtd -r write /tmp/FIRMWARE_NAME.bin firmware&quot;<br />9. Wait a little.
