					<p>Hello All,</p><p>I would like to share with the whole OpenWRT community that I got a fully working openWRT for my RB493G router board including the microSD slot which as far as I could see was not working properly on the original openwrt trunk.</p><p>I have been using that modified OpenWRT on my router for a couple of months since now and it looks stable enough.</p><p>My work is based on the Linux kernel 2.6.35 patch provided by <a href="http://www.mikrotik.com">Mikrotik guys</a> which is in turn the core of RouterOS versions up to 5.x (I believe). So far I only tested it on a RB493G since this is the router I own. However I believe this will be easily expandable to other boards since that Linux patch is supporing also other RB400 series boards.</p><p>I uploaded the code into following repository at <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> in case any of you are interested on knowing what was done or are looking for full working OpenWRT on RB493G (of course at your own risk!). Current master branch is based on OpenWRT trunk revision 34879.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/PrieJos/openwrt-ar71xx-mikrotik.git">https://github.com/PrieJos/openwrt-ar71xx-mikrotik.git</a></p><p>Regards,<br />PrieJos</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>priejos</strong> on 6 Jan 2013, 14:24)</p>

					<p>OpenWrt AA 12.09 BETA/RC1 and trunk are just missing a one-line patch to register the SD-card-reader. Messing around with old kernel versions is not necessary. I hope the patch will make it into AA 12.09. See ticket <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/12349">#12349</a> for further information.</p>									</div>

I only took SPI, NAND and LEDS drivers out of Mikrotik Linux kernel 2.6.35. For the rest, the code base is the one delivered in OpenWRT trunk.</p><p>Regards,<br />PrieJos</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Peoples!</p><p>Maybe anyone had the same problem as I. I&#039;d like to know how I can get measurement from temperature sensor and voltage monitor on OpenWRT in RB493G . Also I&#039;d like to know how I can manage the connectors for coolers from OpenWRT, if is it possible after all.</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p><p>P.S. In mikrotik&#039;s kernel patch i look:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>+#define SPI_CMD_MON_VOLTAGE 0x11 /* send cmd */
+#define SPI_CMD_MON_TEMP 0x12 /* send cmd */
