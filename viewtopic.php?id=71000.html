					<p>Hi, this is my first post here and I&#039;m hopeful you can help me.&nbsp; </p><p>Also, I&#039;m not super familiar with OpenWrt or shell scripts so please bear with me <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I am attempting to automate the ssh client on my Linksys router that is running OpenWrt. </p><p>The computers/devices that I&#039;m ssh-ing into require passwords.</p><p>My initial thought was to make a shell/expect script that uses spawn and expect to fill login credentials. It works fine on my local computer, but it fails on my router. After doing some research, I see this is because OpenWrt uses something called &quot;ash&quot; not bash which is more lightweight. What tools do you recommend I look into for ssh automation on OpenWrt? </p><br /><p><strong>TL; DR: How can I automate ssh client on OpenWrt when logins require passwords?&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p>									</div>
