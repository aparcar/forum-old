					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I just installed Kamikaze on my Linksys Wrt54GL v1.1 for the first time and it seemed to work everything quite fine (ssh login, changing boot_wait=on, boot_time=10, the static ip of the router, the root password).</p><p>Now, I wanted to install Luci and followed that description <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials#">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials#</a><br />But already with the first command </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>opkg update</code></pre></div><p>I get an error </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>opkg not found</code></pre></div><p>I thought that package manager is installed by default, but I couldn&#039;t find anything how to install / activate it.</p><p>Could you please help me?</p><p>Thanks and kind regards,</p><p>Dirk</p><p>PS: I used kamikaze because it was the version I found best /only how tos for.

					<p>I think that in ancient Kamikaze times opkg was called ipkg. You might try that</p><p>But Kamikaze is really ancient and unsupported in general. You should use the newest firmware that has been built for your device.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 22 Oct 2015, 21:28)</p>

					<p>Oh, I see. Could you please confirm that that version is the latest / optimal one for my device:</p><p><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/brcm47xx/legacy/openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_br â€¦ uashfs.bin</a></p><p>Not sure what &quot;legacy&quot; means in that case.</p><p>Can I upgrade my kamikaze with this file as well (sysupgrade openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin)? Is there a step by step introduction? I found something not meeting my device or the current version and I fear to &quot;destroy&quot; my router by doing anything wrong.</p><p>Thanks and kind regards,</p><p>Dirk</p>									</div>

					<p>The Device Page at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt54g">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt54g</a> seems to recommend that you use 8.09.2 - 10.03 and newer have problems.</p><p>I will note that, while it&#039;s fun to try to coax life out of old gear, you&#039;re choosing to live with a lot of compromises that miss out on security updates, feature upgrades, etc. A cheap router made in the last 2 years might be a better bet, since it can run CC (15.05) or maybe BB, which are a boatload more reliable, secure, and the router will have enough flash/ram and CPU to be useful for today&#039;s needs.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your replies! I already saw this overview and in combination with hnyman&#039;s post I was not sure, what to use.</p><p>Are there any recommondations which router to use? I guess I cannot flash any router on the market?! I use it at home, only. No business router is needed. If it would support wlan standards &gt; 54 MBit and (not sure if this is already &quot;state of the art&quot;) Gigabit network, this would be great.</p><p>I&#039;d like to replace my old router (WRT54G - the GL model was only because I wanted to setup VPN years ago and now started it) with the ability to connect to my LAN via VPN.</p><p>My location is Germany (if that&#039;s needed as info).</p>									</div>
