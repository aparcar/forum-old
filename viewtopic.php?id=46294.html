					<p>Dear all,</p><p>first to say, its great to have a forum like this! <br />Second to say is, that i wanted to use the Trendnet TEW 692GR with openwrt. I wanted to use the already built ones which are listed here: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09/ramips/rt288x/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_a â€¦ ps/rt288x/</a></p><p>But there are several bins, so that i do not know which one to choose?</p><p>I think it might be one of those:</p><p>openwrt-ramips-rt288x-f5d8235v1-squashfs-sysupg..&gt; 03-Apr-2013 08:22&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3407876<br />openwrt-ramips-rt288x-root.squashfs&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 03-Apr-2013 08:22&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1966080<br />openwrt-ramips-rt288x-uImage.bin&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;03-Apr-2013 08:22&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 920319<br />openwrt-ramips-rt288x-vmlinux.bin&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 03-Apr-2013 08:22&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2709168<br />openwrt-ramips-rt288x-vmlinux.elf&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 03-Apr-2013 08:22&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2775668</p><p>At the moment i have the factory firmware version 1.0.2.0, 18-May-2012 installed!</p><p>thx a lot, Z</p>									</div>

					<p>From my personal experience with flashing the 692GR router I can not recommend you installing OpenWRT on this router yet.</p><p>1. Compiling the release version 12.09, attitude_adjustment, gave me a working openwrt-ramips-rt3883-tew-692gr-squashfs-factory.bin. With this file I was able to flash the router. But after installation it turned out that WIFI is no longer working.</p><p>2. Compiling the trunk 38812 with the hope of fixed WIFI support. Unfortunately no sysupgrade file for the 692GR router was created by make.</p><p>CU,<br />Stephan</p>									</div>
