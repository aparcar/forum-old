					<p>Dear All;</p><p>I was having a problem building the SQLite interface for python, pysqlite.&nbsp; I finally traced it down to the setup.py script using the wrong include and linking directories for building the extensions.&nbsp; The file setup.cfg was using the general defaults of /usr/include and /usr/lib, which are totally wrong when building for mips on an amd-64 platform.&nbsp; So, I built a patch file, and submit it to all of you here for your approval.&nbsp; Or not -- this is my first shot at something like this, so go ahead and tear it apart.&nbsp; But, I hope if anybody else has this problem, they will find this patch file useful.</p><p>The file listing follows.&nbsp; It is for the file &quot;patch_setup.cfg&quot;, and it goes in the directory .....packages/openwrt-packages/lang/pysqlite/patches</p><p>--- pysqlite-2.3.5/setup.cfg.orig&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2008-03-18 19:21:55.000000000 -0500<br />+++ pysqlite-2.3.5/setup.cfg&nbsp; &nbsp; 2008-03-18 19:22:46.000000000 -0500<br />@@ -1,5 +1,5 @@<br /> [build_ext]<br /> define=<br />-include_dirs=/usr/include<br />-library_dirs=/usr/lib<br />+include_dirs=${CPPFLAGS}<br />+library_dirs=${LDFLAGS}<br /> libraries=sqlite3</p><p>Enjoy.&nbsp; I hope it saves somebody some time, and perhaps even makes it into the next release.</p><p>spudbeach<br />steve@thebeachfamily.org</p>									</div>
