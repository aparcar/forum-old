					<p>I live in an apartment that provides internet access but my apartment resides on the opposite side with no line of sight.&nbsp; The signal I get without aid is about 14% on a 11 mbps all the way to nothing.&nbsp; The security is 64bit WEP.&nbsp; I have no access to the Cisco Router.</p><p>I bought a WRE54G, Wireless-G Range Expander from Linksys.&nbsp; I took it back because it needed a better antenae but the WRE54G didn&#039;t have that option.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also because of the weak anentae it was always reconnecting over and over to the original network but of course to us close to the expander we got a great signal but no internet.&nbsp; And in addition it would not allow us to go straight to the original without unplugging it.&nbsp; Also everyone and their dog connectted to our expander which slowed it up when we were up.</p><p>I bought a Buffalo Tech WHR-HP-G54. Configuring it as an AP.&nbsp; Trying to set it up with WDS was unsuccessful.&nbsp; Not sure if it was because I couldn&#039;t get WDS working or it wasn&#039;t an option.</p><p>So now I am looking about getting WRT54G set it up with openwrt.&nbsp; Now here is my question.<br />1. Can I set it up with WDS?&nbsp; I don&#039;t have access to a wired connection.<br />2. Can I set it up for as an Expander?<br />3. I have access to a WRT54GC.&nbsp; Can I setup the setup to only let my computers access the internet through the expander or AP?</p>									</div>

					<p>repeaters and such:</p><p>- Station (STA, also known as client) mode does not provide support for the source mac address not matching the station&#039;s address; in other words you can&#039;t simply bridge an STA with another interface.<br />- WET is a hacked form of STA mode that performs a NAT of the source address to get around the limitations of station mode. It allows interfaces to be bridged, but it&#039;s quirky and has issues.<br />- Neither STA or WET accept connections; they are strictly clients to another AP.<br />- WDS gets around the limitations of STA mode by using a modified protocol; it can actually bridge correctly and without tricks.<br />- WDS operates in AP mode, and can be used as a repeater, but requires WDS support.<br />- Many devices do not support WDS, or do not support it correctly; on some devices you may find a setting called &quot;point to multipoint&quot; which was an earlier version of WDS. The Cisco is unlikely to have any WDS support.<br />- Most off the shelf repeaters are WET bridged with an AP; you cannot do this under whiterussian, you might be able to do this with kamikaze thanks to a new driver that allows multiple virtual interfaces on a single radio.</p><p>wrt54gc:</p><p>This is not supported by OpenWrt and is unlikely to be supported any time soon.</p><p>Actually doing what you asked:</p><p>You can do what you want using two wifi devices; one to connect to the remote network and another to serve as the local AP. You can use the wrt54gc running stock firmware for one of these devices.</p><p>Using two devices has the advantage of allowing you to run your AP and client on different channels, reducing the contention (overlap, collision) between the devices and increasing the performance.</p><p>(the details of such are best left as an exercise for the reader)</p>									</div>

					<p>It depends on what you want to do.</p><p>If you want your wireless devices to be on the same network (insecure) as the remote access point, you will need to use WET mode, not STA mode. If you connect to an AP as a client (using STA mode) and then send it data signed with a source address other than your client, the AP will ignore it or generate an error. In WET mode the data is modified and the source address is changed to match the client&#039;s address so it will be accepted.</p><p>If you&#039;re not worried about that, you can connect using STA mode and then perform a NAT.</p><p>I&#039;d really rather not harp on the details.</p>									</div>

					<p>The WHR-HP-G54 is a router supported by OpenWRT (the internals are nearly identical to a WRT54G)&nbsp; If the WRT54G is going to be purchased new then the WHR-HP-G54 actually a better unit.&nbsp; All WRT54G&#039;s manufactured in the past year have reduced ram/flash size and are running VxWorks instead of Linux.&nbsp; While OpenWRT can be shoehorned into the new models it is not supported and there is virtually zero space to do anything.</p><p>Also, I haven&#039;t used one myself, but have heard that the WRT54GC has extremely poor range because of it&#039;s intended use as a travel router.&nbsp; Hooking up an antenna to the external connector may counteract that issue though.</p>									</div>
