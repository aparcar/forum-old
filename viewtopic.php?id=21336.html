					<p>Hi,</p><p>I found my old wrt45g in the basement and I am wondering if the following would be possible after installing openwrt on it:</p><p>I have two Fritzboxes (7270). Each has its own network (and his own connection two the internet). I wonder if it would be possible to bridge both networks with a single access point: connecting the lan port of the ap to one fritzbox and using the wlan to connect to the other one. By creating routes on each fritzbox it should be possible to connect each fritzbox to one another without going over the internet? Right?</p><p>This is just an idea and I already looked around the forum and I couldn&#039;t find an exact answer. So please excuse me if I ask such a question once again. THX</p><p>Tobias</p>									</div>
