					<p>Hi there,</p><p>I recently bought a Netgear R9000. From myopenrouter you can easily download openwrt and it works perfectly.</p><p>Now my question:<br />Will there be official support?<br />Do I get anything wrong or is this armv7 which is not official supported by openwrt? Or can I just change the package sources away from &quot;r9000&quot; to another architecture and download + use packages?<br />I think openwrt is a great piece of software and I want to understand more.</p><p>Tobias</p>									</div>

					<p>Check the Netgear GPL for this.. Appears most of the work has been done already for 12.09.</p><p>Should not be very difficult to carry this over for newer versions. </p><p>I may give it a try over the weekend.</p>									</div>
