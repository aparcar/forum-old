I&#039;m currently documenting the Arduino Yun, however I was waiting until someone to the reigns of this documentation effort before jumping in with both feet. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>A little background, I working on starting my own company that does robotic platforms (sort of chassis for robot builders). In the meantime, I must work on making money - so I do full stack mobile development. Right now I spend most of my time on the Arduino Yun forum, the phonegap, then bluetooth, then this forum. It&#039;s about to change. So here we go.....</p><p>Since I do automated documentatio (based on source code). I will ask which language are people most comfortable with. I can do PERL, Python, Bash, TCL/TK, Javascript or Lua (if I learn it). My favorite is TCL/TK, but I&#039;m thinking Python, since it&#039;s widely preferred, but I&#039;d like some opinions. </p><p>After that I&#039;m going to ask where are all the source repositories. I&#039;ll start with the forest, then work the trees. (pun intended). <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>Jesse</p></blockquote></div><p>This was moved over from the &quot;Initiative to improve OpenWrt documentation&quot; thread.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>richbhanover</strong> on 9 May 2015, 13:09)</p>

Creating documentation from source code sounds quite interesting, but it&#039;s a bit off-topic for this thread.
