					<p>Hi,<br />I&#039;m trying to get zabbix-agentd with zabbix-extra-wifi setup on my new TL-WDR3500 running BARRIER BREAKER (Bleeding Edge, r39294).<br />It seems that it needs /var/state/wireless to work properly.<br />Sadly that file is not present on my router. Zabbix-agentd works fine except for the wifi part. I have installed wpad and configured WPA2-Enterprise, wireless is working without any problems, so I guess that the file should be there?<br />What am I doing wrong? Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>
