					<p>FWIW, that build was before 10.03.1 was released....<br />If you read Simon-Notes.txt there it will tell you that actually that driver build never seems to work/load <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p><p>I believe, the problem with the switch was fixed in the 10.03.1 release version -- i.e. all 4 Ethernet ports work.&nbsp; AFAIK there has never been working VLAN configuration support for that marvell chipset ethernet.</p><p>Also, to have WPA2 Wireless working (TNETW1130 ONLY -- e.g. DG834Gv2), NOT on TNETW1350A (e.g. DG834Gv3) you need a later wireless driver in e.g. a &#039;trunk&#039; build which I may be able to find you at least a binary of...</p><p>The build linked above is probably not so useful any more <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p>									</div>
