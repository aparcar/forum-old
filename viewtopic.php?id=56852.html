					<p>hi all,<br />ssh&#039;ing to my openwrt (ver. 10.03.1-RC6) shows that there is something wrong with its dns server:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# nslookup starkill
Server:    127.0.0.1
Address 1: 127.0.0.1 localhost.

nslookup: can&#039;t resolve &#039;starkill&#039;: Name or service not known</code></pre></div><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# nslookup starkill.skails.home
Server:    127.0.0.1
Address 1: 127.0.0.1 localhost.

Name:      starkill.skails.home
Address 1: 192.168.112.138 starkill.skails.home</code></pre></div><p>As you can see the local dns server (dnsmasq) of openwrt cannot resolve non-FQDN hostnames. appending the domain of my intranet resolves this issue, but does not work for me:</p><p>Since I have a dns server running in my intranet, I would like to at least have openwrt&#039;s dnsmasq consult my primary dns server.</p><p>so I checked the web-config over and over but couldn&#039;t figure out what is wrong or missing.<br />Then I checked the file /etc/config/network , along with this manual website <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network.">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network.</a></p><p>the file initially looked like:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[...]

The reason is that i use my WRT54G as an access point only. I utilize one ethernet interface (which is connected to the rest of my intranet, and where internet gateway lies) and basically use the antennas of my unit to provide access to intranet and internet for wifi devices. so nothing major here.</p><p>anyhow, trying to alter /etc/config/network did not yield the expected result and i still cannot resolve non-FQDN hostnames.<br />What is more I cannot even do the resolving when I explicitly suggest a nameserver, either through `/etc/resolv.conf` , or directly with `nslookup`:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# nslookup starkill 192.168.112.112
