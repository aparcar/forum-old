					<p>Hello,<br />Yesterday I decided to check how secure is openwrt , so I installed Kali Linux and scanned WiFi networks by using <br />&quot;airodump-ng mon0&quot; command and it listed my WiFi network and the connected clients with Mac address of each of them (I am actually not connected to the WiFi network) . My question is how can I prevent this program from listing my connected clients and their Mac addresses and is it possible to use iptables in order to block that program ? Anyway my network security type is WPA2-PSK.</p>									</div>

					<p>no way, its catching and analyzing standard wifi packets using monitor mode, you can only disable wifi to prevent this<br />wpa2-psk is strongest auth/cypher for home use, but don&#039;t use passwords less than 12 symbols, weaker passwords can be bruteforced using catched handshake for hours</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stas2z</strong> on 19 Jul 2016, 10:41)</p>

					<p>Indeed, anyone can passively listed to your radio, as long as you are broadcasting..... So turning off you wifi is the only solution:P But the advice above is good, use WPA2 (with AES), have a long password and you should be fine. There will be much easier targets around you to attack than you.</p>									</div>

					<p>In IEEE 802.11 mac addresses (source and destination) are not encrypted, no matter if you use wpa1/2 or anything you want, the encrypted is the payload data only.</p><p>You can imagine the huge overload for a wifi device if mac addresses would be encrypted, it would be needed to decode all packets to know which is for the device.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>iasimov</strong> on 27 Jul 2016, 01:41)</p>
