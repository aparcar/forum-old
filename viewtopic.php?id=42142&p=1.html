					<p>Coincidentally, we&#039;ve just received this device on our test bench.&nbsp; It was purchased to possibly use in a project requiring remote connections.&nbsp; It seems fairly capable, containing<br/>4MB Flash - PMC PM25LQ032<br/>16MB RAM - ESMT M12L128168A</p><p>And has the added benefit of being explicitly pinned out to a very good degree.&nbsp; The downside is that the software has been modified to limit hackability.&nbsp; There is almost no boot text except for </p><p>LINUX started...</p><p> THIS IS ASIC</p><p>And it doesn&#039;t seem possible to trap in u-boot&#039;s command interpreter.&nbsp; TFTP (although blind due to no text output) may be an option because starting up while repeatedly pressing 1 on host PC does make the device pause and stop the boot sequence.&nbsp; Something to try later.</p><p>So far, we&#039;ve dumped the serial flash and are just taking a small look around to see what build they may be running.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>oschemes</strong> on 4 Mar 2013, 21:46)</p>

					<p>I&#039;ve been playing with these modules a bit and I have discovered a few things.&nbsp; There are a number of undocumented AT commands in the stock firmware.&nbsp; Here&#039;s the full list of them:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Channel
CLport
default
dhcpc
dhcpd
dhcpd_dns
dhcpd_ip
dhcpd_time
err
escap
excxxx
Get_MAC
gpio_mode
gpio_read

net_ip

net_wanip
out_trans
pm
reboot
reconn
remoteip
remoteport
remotepro
S2N_Stat
save
settings
settings_done
status
suspend
tcp_auto
tcp_client_check
uart
uartpackintertimeout
uartpacklen
uartpacktimeout
ver
wifi_conf
wifi_ConState
wifi_Scan
XON_XOFF</code></pre></div><p>The most interesting of these is at+excxxx, its just a call to system() with the argument you provide.&nbsp; You can start telnetd with it to get a shell.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>at+excxxx=telnetd</code></pre></div><p>You can also get a shell on UART2 by sending the special sequence &quot;174317529705122&quot; and return.&nbsp; getty sets up the port for 57600 baud and waits on this sequence before its allowed to accept characters and output anything.&nbsp; login has already issued the &quot;login:&quot; prompt, so after entering the sequence, you won&#039;t see anything until login asks for the password.</p><p>I&#039;ve documented the above already in the wiki, including a bit on TFTP, check it out.</p><p>Here&#039;s a couple of handy resources not referenced here yet:</p><p>A schematic of the HLK starter kit V1.7 PCB in this zip: <a href="http://m5.img.dxcdn.com/CDDriver/CD/sku.214540.zip">http://m5.img.dxcdn.com/CDDriver/CD/sku.214540.zip</a><br/>The manual for the module in English is here: <a href="http://www.hlktech.net/inc/lib/download/download.php?DId=19">http://www.hlktech.net/inc/lib/download … php?DId=19</a></p><p>Cheers!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jkent</strong> on 9 Jun 2013, 22:22)</p>
