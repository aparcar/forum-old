					<p>The router I&#039;m working on is a Telsey CPA-ZNTE60FWB, openwrt works great on it (probably a branded variant of CPA-ZNTE60T already present in the wiki) but I need to add an external antenna to use it in my environment.</p><p>The router uses three antennas soldered on the PCB, they are simple piece of metal between antenna output and the gnd. I tried substituting one of them with a connector to my external cantenna without success, if I connect or disconnect the external antenna nothing changes.</p><p>The first differences between the two kind of antenna is that the one on pcb is &quot;shorted&quot; to the ground but my cantenna doesn&#039;t.</p><p>Taking a better look to the pcb I&#039;ve noticed empty placements that imho can be eventually used for external antenna connectors, aren&#039;t they? (MJ2 on the right side of the picture)</p><p>I think changing MC571 and MC572 I can &quot;redirect&quot; the signal to an external connector, what&#039;s your opinion?<br />Any suggestion on what I can try?</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ph38z45p7yo4o9b/P4260160.JPG?dl=1" alt="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ph38z45p7yo4o9b/P4260160.JPG?dl=1" /></span></p>									</div>

					<p>I tried without success but investigating on the chip RT2529 I&#039;ve found it implements MIMO.</p><p>So I think it should be the problem... accordingly with its architecture block it should uses different antennas to transmit and to receive, shouldn&#039;t it?</p>									</div>

					<p>IIRC some drivers allow to switch between auto select or using one particular antenna. See also <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless</a></p>									</div>

					<p>I already tried disabling diversity and using the same antenna for both rx and tx... but I haven&#039;t found a way to establish which antenna is in use so I tried empirically with 0, 1 and 2 without success.</p>									</div>
