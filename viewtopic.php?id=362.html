					<p>Hello,</p><p>is there any possibility to get root from a nfs-server at boot time?<br />This would be pretty, thus i don&#039;t have to bother about memory size and write cycles.<br />Thanks, bye, b52</p>									</div>

					<p>I think it should be possible.&nbsp; You could try to mount the remote fs, and the &quot;pivot_root&quot; to it.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if it would work.&nbsp; Other option would be a &quot;nfs root&quot; support in kernel (I used it with &quot;etherboot&quot; a long time ago).</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, I would also use pivot_root method, but could anybody tell me how to get sunrpc.o, lockd.o and nfs.o into my kernel? Because at the moment i have to do a pivot_root to get /dev/mtdblock/4 on /, insmod all the nfs-modules and do a second pivot_root to get my nfs share on /.<br />Has anybody experience with that?<br />Thanks, bye, b52</p>									</div>

					<p>Tried nfs root, didn&#039;t work though. </p><p>Can mount nfs disk and pivot_root actually succeeds. But then after mount /proc and /dev and /dev/pts, the /sbin/init call fails. </p><p>Tried manually execute above steps. Got same result. Busybox executes the init precedure but seemed init didn&#039;t call /etc/inittab. So I end up with a pivoted root and same proccesses as before pivot_root. </p><p>I don&#039;t have usb interface. So can&#039;t try USB way. </p><p>BTW, my configuration is: <br />WRT54G v2<br />Whiterussian rc4</p><p>Any comments?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dreamdreams</strong> on 6 Dec 2005, 06:42)</p>
