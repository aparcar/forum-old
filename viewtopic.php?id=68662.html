					<p>I am unable to set following mac address &quot;36:AA:42:FB:B9:57&quot; with /etc/config/wireless file, But with mac address &quot;36:AA:42:FB:B9:58&quot; interface is up.<br />&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a&nbsp; MAC address should have 0 as a least significant bit (unicast) and 1 as a second least significant bit (locally administered) in the second nibble.&nbsp; Thus possible values for the second nibble are limited to 2, 6, A and E.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In other words <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MAC address:&nbsp; “XY-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX” “X” can be anything hexadecimal.&nbsp; The hexadecimal “Y”, written in binary format, is&nbsp; Y:&nbsp; “kmnp”,&nbsp; where “p” is the least significant bit; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; p=0 --&gt; unicast; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; p=1 --&gt; multicast; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; n=0 --&gt; globally assigned MAC; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; n=1 --&gt; locally administered; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So, actually MAC can be changed&nbsp; to any combination in which p=0 and n=1;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; “Y” can be 2, 6, A or E.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So the possible MAC addresses in Windows 7 for wireless adapters:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; X2-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; X6-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XA-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XE-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX</p><p>&quot;</p>									</div>
