					<p>hi,<br />is it possible to install openwrt on a cuteBox-2300sx?<br />this box is equipped with a vortex86 cpu, 128M of RAM and a compact flash reader.<br />This CPU is FPU less so it&#039;s necessary to compile the kernel with Math emulation</p><p>anybody try openwrt with this hardware?</p>									</div>
