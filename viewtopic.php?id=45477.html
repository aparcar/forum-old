					<p>I&#039;m guessing that development folks are not fans of Broadcomm routers with close source drivers that they can&#039;t patch and work on efficiently. You can actually build your own trunk copy and add the relevant patches here:</p><p><a href="http://www.znau.edu.ua/temp/asus-rt-n16/">http://www.znau.edu.ua/temp/asus-rt-n16/</a></p><p>It might be better in the long run to demote the Asus to an AP+switch and get an Atheros router.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have this router as well. It is actually working well using the current standard trunk build. The only thing is that Wifi only works as 802.11g. Is someone going to improve this in the main build or do I somehow have to add some patches and add some proprietary binaries myself? Or can I add it through opkg using some .ipk kernel module package?</p>									</div>
