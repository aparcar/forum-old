					<p>Ok, </p><p>Where to start.</p><p>The guys at <a href="http://www.micasaverde.com">www.micasaverde.com</a> have been kind enough to posted their source code for vera, which is built on openwrt Kamikaze.<br />Vera is home control system based on LinuxMCE/Pluto. It uses LUA script to control devices and by default make them appear as upnp devices.<br />&nbsp; <br />Since the source is release under GPL (apart from z-wave binary&#039;s which don&#039;t interest me anyway) I thought.. wouldn&#039;t it be nice to see if I could get this running on a spare NSLU2 and use it to control my A/V equipment over lan with a UPNP control point... well I can&#039;t.</p><p>I don&#039;t think it&#039;s impossible, just my knowledge is limited.</p><p>I have debian 5 installed on VM and the kamikaze 8.09 build environment... I can even cross compile to the NSLU2... work like a charm... :-)</p><p>According to the micasaverde wiki i should be to take the openwrt trunk and the source provided by them, and build a new firmware... </p><p>Ok sounds reasonable... </p><p>However the source doesn&#039;t contain any Makefile for openwrt. It&#039;s made up of several folders each containing the C++ code, standard linux makefiles pre-post bash scripts etc etc. i.e DCERouter, PlutoUtlies.. (Have to confess I&#039;m a little new to C/C++ I&#039;m more used to Java on a windows box, so probblay my lack of knowledge on the structures of these files for compilation. I&#039;m also not that familar with openwrt either) </p><p>I don&#039;t know if I should be creating a new /package or several packages and defining a &#039;Makefile/s&#039;, (Everything I&#039;ve read on the net points me in this direction). or if this is way more complicated then I gave it credit for..<br />I&#039;ve tried both of the above, doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s not the right way to go though, only that i didn&#039;t do it the right way !</p><p>Anyone with any experience of &#039;taking the openwrt trunk + additional source&#039; ? Anyone want to help me ? Anyone with a nslu2 or alternative router want to try vera ?</p><p>Just some pointers would be good. I don&#039;t expect anyone to do it for me, I do want to learn myself. </p><p>I did post on their forums but not many users and I figured there are many more experience users here. </p><p>Thanks.</p><p>Phill</p>									</div>
