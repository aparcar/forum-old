					<p>we have been using OpenWRT on Lantiq&#039;s evaluation board with the following details.<br />Target Lantiq GPON/XWAY<br />Subtarget Danube<br />Target Profile (EASY50712)</p><p>We have tested the following the following USB drivers provided with the latest openwrt/trunk version (downloaded yesterday):<br />-Kmod-usb-core<br />-Kmod-usb2<br />-Kmod-serial-to-usb</p><p>In all cases we observe lost packets when sending files to a PC and receiving them back. Some times the kernel crashes, while crashes happen always when we try to physically connect a USB HUB or a media USB device.</p><br /><p>As a workaround We&#039;ve tried to implement another USB port by using an external Vinculum VNC1L Chip. It works connected to a serial port. The problem we encounter now is that the UART0 port of the Danube seems dead.... We discovered that even if we write the respective register (MCON), it remains incactive. Moreover we&#039;ve tried to include the UART0 as console from the make menuconfig util and the result was the same.</p><p>Has anybody activated the second serial port of Danube?</p><p>Thanks,</p>									</div>

					<p>I suggest to build the OpenWrt with symbol table information enabled. Then file a ticket including the OOPS message when the kernel crashes.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the debug information. We will do so.<br />For the activation of the UART0 do you have any info to give us?<br />The UART1 is already working. The UART0 is problematic (we write the registers but they seem unwritten..)</p><p>Thanks,</p>									</div>

					<p>No unfortunately I do not have experience with the Lantiq platform, approach the openwrt-devel mailing list and ask for specific help regarding UART0, the main OpenWrt Lantiq developer is subscribed there.</p>									</div>
