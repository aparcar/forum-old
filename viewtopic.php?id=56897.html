					<p>Hello,</p><br /><p>Sorry for my beginners questions, but does OpenWRT use HostAPD?<br />If yes, why does dual band work with OpenWRT (at least, that&#039;s what I understood so far) and it doesn&#039;t work elsewhere?</p><p>Thanks for helping me out.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, OpenWrt does use hostapd.<br />Sometimes only components like wpad, wpa-supplicant,hostapd - see <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless/encryption">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless/encryption</a> for feature differences.</p><p>Dual Band normally means one of two things in routers:<br />- one wireless radio that can send/receive in 2.4GHz OR 5GHz<br />- two wireless radios: one in 2.4GHz the other in 5GHz</p><p>You cannot use 1 radio on both frequencies at the same time.<br />Only with special packets can you bundle the wireless connections in 2.4 and 5GHz to one virtual connection. Since most clients only have 1 radio they do not benefit from this solution(see above).</p>									</div>

					<p>I have an Archer T4U, which has, if I understood that right, 2 wireless radios - 1 in 2,4GHz and the other in 5GHz.<br />What I try to achieve, is that the clients, that can use 5GHz can connect on that radio and the others use the one at 2,4GHz.<br />So you say, that with special packets, I could use both radios at the same time and bundle them to one virtual network interface?<br />Which are those special packets?</p><p>Thanks a lot for your postings!</p>									</div>
