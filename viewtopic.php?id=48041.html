I see there are solid quality atheros based new mimo routers for ~50$ on amazon and other shops... I&#039;m interested why you went with this one specifically?</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m really pleased with stability on WR741ND and WR841ND line of routers but they are basic models. WR703N is best for DIY and hacking projects.</p><p>Just can&#039;t figure out which is best for power users who need really fast wifi connection at home. I have tried using WR1043ND from TP-Link but it has lots and lots of bugs in wifi... so don&#039;t use that one.</p>									</div>
