					<p>@david<br />Installed r3582 on my wrt1900acs v1. Have same issue I had when cybrnook did his first builds after the switch change. I assign a custom MAC to the IPv4 WAN interface. When I do this I no longer get a public IP address from my ISP and do not have any Internet connectivity. My configuration is ATT UVerse Gateway (modem/router) to Internet. I configure in the Gateway DMZ a MAC address. When things work I then get the same IPv4 address as the Gateway assigned to the router WAN interface. As long as I do not make the MAC change I get an IP address from the Gateway and have Internet. Of course also double NAT. Had this same issue with cybrnook&#039;s first build with the switch change. His later builds do not have this issue. </p><p>Here is the network config file - yes I know about publishing the MAC address <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>config interface &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option type &#039;bridge&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth0.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;192.168.1.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ip6assign &#039;60&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth1.2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;dhcp&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option hostname &#039;LEDE&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option macaddr &#039;E4:F4:C6:08:18:7B&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;wan6&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth1.2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;dhcpv6&#039;</p><p>config switch<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option name &#039;switch0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option reset &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option enable_vlan &#039;1&#039;</p><p>config switch_vlan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;switch0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ports &#039;0 1 2 3 5t&#039;</p><p>config switch_vlan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;switch0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan &#039;2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ports &#039;4 6t&#039;</p><p>For now I am running ispyisail Gargoyle 2-10-2017<br />Runs well.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bill1228</strong> on 28 Feb 2017, 00:14)</p>

					<p>@bill1228</p><p>at&amp;t sucks! I have a co-worker on at&amp;t, and he has to put his router in the DMZ as well. He did buy a ubiquiti router that has 3 interfaces (WAN and 2 LAN). It has the ability to split the specific traffic to allow the att router to authenticate, and the rest of the traffic goes to his router. I don&#039;t think he has it set up like this yet, but it&#039;s something he wants to work on.</p><p>Thanks for the info.</p>									</div>

					<p>@david<br />Never had&nbsp; any issues with this setup until the switch change for, I guess, wrt3200. ATT for me has been rock solid. Much better then what my daughter gets from Comcast. They have to reset their modem at least once a week. Have had service calls, etc without any fix. My good old UVerse just keeps purring along. My ATT gateway has been up for over a year now. May not be the fastest service, 23Mbps, but for my streaming and downloading just works and is dependable. </p><p>Not sure what cybrnook did with his builds, but I do not have any issues with his since the first one with the new switch config. Maybe he just grabbed a source that was fixed. I know when I run his the WAN is eth1.2 same as yours. </p><p>Let me know if there is something you would like me to try. I usually can get a window of time between teen girl and wife when I can take things down without too much screaming. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> Teen wants to stream stuff and wife wants her email fix.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bill1228</strong> on 28 Feb 2017, 03:15)</p>
