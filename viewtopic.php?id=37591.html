					<p>All,</p><p>Just received a new Apple Airport Express (2012 version). It has the option to &quot;extend&quot; the network, which I have read as being a more standards based WDS for .11n networks that allows full speed.</p><p>Does OpenWRT allow this? I have my wireless settings set to AP (WDS) and am not able to get the Airport Express to connect. It keeps giving me an error that the networks (both 2.4 and 5 GHz) do not support extending.</p><p>I looked all through the wiki and google and these suggestions are for the OpenWRT device to be the &quot;client&quot; device, and not for it to be the device that gets extended.</p><p>Many thanks in advance!</p>									</div>
