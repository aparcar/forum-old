					<p>Hey, turn on you brain.</p><p>1. Read the article, and see if there are <strong>mistakes</strong> in it! Please do mend them.<br />2. See if there is stuff <strong>missing</strong>. Please do add stuff you think belongs in there.</p><p>Because I have no idea whether you check the wiki, I annouce it here in the forum.</p><p>Also, you may have noticed that google does not find content in the wiki. That way, there is at least one deep-link to it.</p><p>If people assume the wiki is dead, they won&#039;t even search for content in it. Not to mention contribute to it.</p>									</div>

As long as the admins/site-owners/other contributors don&#039;t bother you, don&#039;t obfuscate you and don&#039;t undo your work, you should do it.<br />You don&#039;t do it for them, you do it for people like yourself you seek knowledge AND share theirs (sic!).</p><p>Another motivation is the promotion of a good idea. I think, OpenWrt is a brilliant idea. To have a small Linux on my router? How fucking awesome is that? And then especially compare it with &quot;solutions&quot; that still use NVRAM or TFFS and then their &quot;customer friendly&quot; webinterfaces? Pfff.<br />IMO, they only seem customer friendly, they are not in the end run. They keep you unknowing and lazy.<br />However, instead of talking how cool it is, you should rather write one or two howtos to prove how useful it truly can be. That google just keeps pointing to obsolete howtos, that is a major major major major PITA. I hope to find out the reason for that. Anybody SEO?</p><p>2.<br />Politeness is overrated. Having the choice between ruthless honesty and polite bullshit, I&#039;d go with the first. In the long run, everybody is just better of with that. It&#039;s not like I am keen to hurt your feelings, it simply was an &quot;unsmart&quot; posting. Most people here ignore such, I react to it. So I give a damn.</p>									</div>
