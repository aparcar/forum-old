					<p>Hi!<br />I have a Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH and I am unable to tftp to it.&nbsp; I&#039;m using windows.&nbsp; I have tried windows xp, windows 7, windows vista, and windows 2000.&nbsp; I have also used tftp that comes with windows, the linksys tftp program, and pumpKIN tftp.&nbsp; I have set 192.168.11.1 to the routers mac address, i have turned off windows firewall, i have set my network card to 10 full duplex, 10 half duplex, 100 full duplex, 100 half duplex, I tried to reset the router.&nbsp; <br />Also, I was able to ssh to the router and start the upgrade to openwrt from dd-wrt but I think it failed, or I shut the router off before it could finish.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t tftp to it before I did this either.</p><p>Could some one give me any tips (other than ones that suggest using linux)?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>I figured out what the problem was.<br />Although the model number says I have a WZR-HP-G300NH on the box, on the sticker on the unit,<br />I actually have a WZR-HP-G<span style="color: #ff0000">301</span>NH.</p>									</div>
