					<p>Hello to the Forum,</p><p>I am having an issue with the current openwrt on tp-link hardware (1043nd v3). I have set up successfully my strongswan ikev2 connection with PSKs. <strong>Everything seems to work, I can ping through the tunnel in both directions an reach all hosts via ICMP. However I cannot reach the openwrt interface addresses and the other hosts behind this side via TCP through the tunnel and I am not able to find out why that is. </strong>This probably due to my lack of understanding of the openwrt firewall configuration, all the other strongswan vpn experience I have is with standard linux/iptables systems. It would be great if someone could have a look at my configuration. </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>openwrt: ip 10.10.99.1 (left side from point of view of openwrt)
ip on other endpoint: 10.10.101.1 (right side)</code></pre></div><p>I have NOT configured any additional zone until now. My etc/config/firewall looks like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config defaults

					<p>I now tried many different things. Finally the problem was gone after I restarted the linux debian server which was the other endpoint. I have no idea what caused this problem. The above config on openwrt side is working and correct, perhaps that helps someone in the future...</p><p>Thanks for your assistance!</p>									</div>
