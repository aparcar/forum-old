					<p>Hi,<br />My home router was been hacked and backdored, it is a very simple router without any password to configure.<br />So I want build a good and secure router with openwrt installed. But I would like to buy a router with a firmware upgrade protection. That&#039;s mean some kind of manual button or jumper to enable/disable firmware upgrade.<br />is there anyone ?</p>									</div>

					<p>You won&#039;t need that kind of protection with OpenWRT Properly configured. ANY router that OpenWRT supports will give you sufficient protection from people remotely changing your firmware/hacking into it.</p><p>With OpenWRT, you need the username and password, or physical access to the router, to modify/upgrade the firmware.</p><p>You can even add firewall rules, to disallow people from accessing it from the WAN.</p><p>However, a physical protection is impossible- there are no devices in existence that can stop someone with physical access from modding; given time and patience,</p><p>If your looking for a good router that supports OpenWRT, go through the list of supported devices. <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start</a></p><p>A good overall router would be the D-Link DIR-835; but without information on what your using the router for, it&#039;s kind of hard to recommend one.</p><p>V/r,<br />Conjur</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />my last router has not any access from wan but from lan. I don&#039;t think that some complicated password can be enough protection to block some hacker to flash the firmware. Because browser and operating system have lot&#039;s of 0day and it&#039;s pretty simple sniff the password. Also the linux kernel suffer of some bugs that can give access to the device.<br />I don&#039;t want something that block phisical access to the device, but something that block firmware unauthorized flashing without human intervention.<br />A phisical switch that allow the firmware flashing.</p>									</div>

					<p>I suppose you could develop and recompile OpenWRT to require pressing one of the buttons on the router before it would complete a firmware upgrade, but otherwise as Conjur said, there aren&#039;t devices out there that natively provide that security.&nbsp; Even Cisco can have its firmware wiped remotely if someone has the username/password to get in (although I think they have a mode that such management can only be done via the serial console).<br />As for someone sniffing the password, configure your router to only allow connections to its configuration interface via SSL (for web access) and SSH (Secure telnet).&nbsp; These protocols provide network encryption in the same way (and security) that online banking/commerce provides.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also be sure you have a really good password using all of upper case, lower case, numeric and symbol characters.&nbsp; &nbsp;One&#039;s pet&#039;s name would not be a good candidate.<br />For additional security, you can also change the admin user account on many routers.</p><p>Hacking the firmware itself ithough s less likely a situation than getting into the router configuration utility and making changes there.</p><p>Come to think of it, depending on the hardware platform, OpenWRT often can&#039;t install firmware through its web interface, but rather you have to install it through the bootloader.&nbsp; &nbsp;Getting access to the bootloader interface, particularly through Telnet, would require pressing buttons at the appropriate time upon powerup.<br />But that wouldn&#039;t secure you from someone hacking the router configuration, which as I said is probably more of a danger and probablily than installing new code.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>danman32</strong> on 31 Jul 2013, 13:39)</p>
