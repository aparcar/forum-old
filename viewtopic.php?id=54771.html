					<p>Hello,</p><p>I wonder if it is possible to run OpenWrt on either the <a href="http://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G141578608433">C1</a> or <a href="http://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G138745696275">U3</a> made by ODROID. The Hardware is similiar, but far more powerful then the Raspberry Pi&#039;s one, which is officially supported.</p><p>Although there doesn&#039;t seem to be any information concerning this specific platines, I&#039;m sure one could build OpenWrt by himself.</p><p>Furthermore, would there be any problems using the only Gigabit or Ethernet interface as WAN- and LAN-Port simultaneously or should a <a href="http://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G137447448698">USB3.0-Gigabit adapter</a> be taken into consideration?</p><p>But the most important thing: If the setup works well, will there be enough power/bandwith to run encrypted VPN connections with speeds around 100Mbps? Theoretically, featuring a ARM/Exynos quadcore with 1.5/1.7 Ghz and 1/2 GB of RAM and a Gigabit/Ethernet on the single network interface, this should be possible.</p><p>Well, theoretically. That&#039;s why I opened this thread. I am forced to use a VPN connection, which now &quot;runs&quot; on my PC, thus any other devices connected to my current router won&#039;t tunnel through it. Obviously, my machine is more than capable of using my full bandwith of +100Mbps. But that is not the case for almost all commercial router models (in an acceptable price range), so I am looking for a selfmade cheap solution.</p><p>Has anyone already done something similiar or can give me advice? Any critical statements are highly appreciated!</p><p>PS: WLAN is quite unimportant as there is only one smartphone in use. A single antenna using <a href="http://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G141630348024">this stick</a> would totally do the job.</p><br /><p>PPS: Hopefully, this is the right subforum. If not, sorry <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

					<p>A fellow (user &quot;umiddelb&quot;) on the ODROID forums claims to have something working, though he provides very little info on how he did it:</p><p><a href="http://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=114&amp;t=8634#p89949">http://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f â€¦ 634#p89949</a></p><p>I&#039;m trying to do the same (for U2 and C1, both of which I have), but documenting the process as I go.&nbsp; Once I get something working, I&#039;ll post here and at the ODROID forums.</p><p>The idea of using the tiny but powerful ODROIDs as OpenWRT routers is exciting to me... Size of a RasPI, 64 GB of Flash, 2 GB of RAM, 1.7GHz quad cores to play with?&nbsp; &nbsp;Fantastic!</p>									</div>
