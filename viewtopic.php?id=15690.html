					<p>Hi guys I have a Linksys WRT54GS V7 With DD-WRT installed (Micro Version of course) The problem is I want to use OPENwrt (Kamakazi) because there is a walkthrough on how to install a SD Card Reader to a WRT54GS V5&nbsp; using OpenWRT, which the only difference I can see is the CPU and the amount of memory and a Forward facing power switch which is non-existant on the V7. Anyhew the CPU is 240Mhz Physical Memory is 16MB and Flash Memory 2MB.</p><p>The whole reason I want to do this is because I want to be able to have flexibility of more ram and the AutoAP feature which mimics a unsecured wireless router nearby so you can use it, basically it scans the surrounding area every 90 seconds for another unsecured network to latch onto and mimic it. Sort of like an repeater of sorts.</p><p>My two questions are A) Can autoap work on OpenWRT (Kamakazi) since this is a dirivative of DD-WRT and possibly has scripting ability? B) Has anyone successfully installed a SD Card on their WRT54GS v7 router to increase Flash and Physical Memory? Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Dachha2</strong> on 17 May 2008, 22:53)</p>

					<p>Congratulations on your marriage. I guess that after you have not much time for writing programs ... love is more important that the machines (my wife&#039;s calling me now to get off to &quot;make company&quot;) </p><p>I think autoap is a program very useful. Today I use it with dd-wrt correctly and a computer chip with Broadcom, but I&#039;d like to be able to use it in a fonera. The problem lies in the chip, not the firmware. <br />Do you think your program would run on a fonera? </p><p>(incidentally, the ping to google is the best option to check out the Internet. I was working very well)</p>									</div>
