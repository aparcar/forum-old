					<p>aaaand its bricked. followed word for word, never got to the upgrade stage. solid orange led, responds to pings but doesnt do much else - http connection refused..</p><p>EDIT: not bricked, managed to ssh in, not sure what to do from here. though it&#039;s not urgent, help would be appreciated.</p><p>EDIT: got a web gui up and wifi functional - turns out that i didnt have a gui because i flashed a trunk version., having difficulty configuring it as a wireless bridge - the 5ghz interface doesn&#039;t see any networks, and though i am connected to the my home network via the 2.4ghz interface, it doesnt seem to be passing through the internet connection properly - sites &#039;take too long to respond&#039;. any ideas?</p><p>Edit: turned off dhcp, configured through relayd. it&#039;s functional but awful now, and while it is in fact passing connections through, the router is now taking too long to respond in luci while timing out in ssh sessions.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tooandrew</strong> on 24 May 2016, 08:14)</p>
