					<p>Hello everyone.</p><p>Hope the subject title isn&#039;t too generic.<br />I&#039;m new here, and my name&#039;s Xander, and i&#039;m currently in posession of a WRT54G v3.1 router.. possibly planning on a WRT54GL depending on success modding the WRT54G.<br />I purchased it in The Netherlands (Europe) and so far it&#039;s been a gem, apart from little problems such as occasional lockups.. which I mostly blame on the rather tacky Motorola Surfboard cable modem i&#039;m stuck with.<br />Anyway, i&#039;ve been aware of OpenWRT since before my purchase, I came upon OpenWRT when I was looking to de-brick a D-Link DI-604 <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />When that took too long I purchased the WRT54G, and on the day of it&#039;s arrival.. I succeeded in de-bricking the DI-604. such luck.. but anyway, i&#039;m better off with the WRT54G.<br />I&#039;ve been trawling through the Wiki and the forums in search of information for hardware hacks/mods for my WRT54G, specifically version 3.1 which I have.<br />I&#039;ve found a lot of information, but I must admit.. even though i&#039;m not -that- old (27) I got a little lost after some 40 odd pages, as I couldn&#039;t find anything conclusive for the v3.1 regarding COM-port and SD/MMC card hacks.. and that is the reason I am posting here.</p><p>The plan is, or was, as follows:</p><p>1. Build myself a JTAG cable. This seems to be the preferred first step.<br />2. Flash with suitable OpenWRT made firmware, obviously.<br />3. add two COM-ports, first for a console, second for perhaps a thermal sensor, or lcd display..?<br />4. Possible RAM upgrade and/or overclock, plenty of suitable heatsinks available.<br />5. add one SD/MMC card slot<br />6. Enjoy.</p><p>So what i&#039;m specifically seeking an answer on is.. what of the above is possible with a WRT54G 3.1?<br />I won&#039;t be able to buy the prebuilt COM-port modules, they will be too expensive to justify their purchase thanks to our local tax office and one of their 1997 laws regarding non-EU purchases being sent here by mail from abroad, so I will have to fashion my own based on the images I saw on <a href="http://www.compsys1.com/workbench/On_top_of_the_Bench/Max233_Adapter/max233_adapter.html">this website</a>, I might need help determining some component values since they aren&#039;t listed on the site (for obvious reasons ofcourse, can&#039;t make it too easy) or base it off of some other design.<br />Same for the SD/MMC card slot, i&#039;m still looking for an alternative, might end up with a Micro SD card adapter and use that instead if I can&#039;t find something nicer.</p><p>Hoping i&#039;ve not overstepped some rule posting this i&#039;ll scoot now and go to bed, since it&#039;s 1.19AM at the moment.<br />Actual hacking will have to wait a little. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> Thanks in advance for any advice or comment given.</p>									</div>

					<p>JTAG is no necessary unless you have a very recent version of WRT (not yours) or a bricked one, use TFTP, it&#039;s the actual preferred step for this.</p><p>If you got lost on the documentation you&#039;re probably not about to do a ram upgrade as it&#039;s very complex (I get lost to mind you).</p><p>Overclocking is possible not particularly a good idea, you&#039;ll need a JTAG for this as you&#039;ll probably brick it if you try overclocking. FYI I&#039;ve had two out of 4 WRTs bricked for minor overclocking, JTAG brought them back.</p><p>SD/MMC is really only necessary if you&#039;re installing a lot or working with big files, it&#039;s not really going to improve normal performance.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ll start on the firmware next weekend when i&#039;m home, i&#039;m just keeping a shopping list for myself.. firmware would only take 5 minutes, i&#039;m looking for a challenge. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Not too worried about bricking it, a replacement WRT54GL is waiting for me in another town, plus making the JTAG cable gives me something to do.<br />I&#039;m doing it for the challenge and the practise as well to be honest, not as much for performance really. I have soldering equipment begging for attention. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />Reason (for me at least) I got lost on the documentation is because it&#039;s all a bit scattered and there&#039;s bits missing all over. That&#039;s okay, I think we&#039;re trying to gather information while learning anyway, which is ultimately my goal too.<br />So just need to fill in the gaps from the list above a little bit more.<br />I might actually have the exact same RAM chips on a pair of sticks, type as described by <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Customizing/Hardware/RAM_upgrade">booBot</a>, but will check later again to be sure. They are Kingston DDR-SDRAM modules. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />SD/MMC; As far as installing a lot might go, depends on the packages I suppose. a small Samba or Shoutcast server might be nice <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> but i&#039;ll worry about that later.</p><p>Thank you for replying.</p><br /><p>Edit: speEling eeroooorrrss.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Xolo</strong> on 3 Oct 2007, 02:05)</p>

					<p>Weekend is here.<br />Going to try freeing up some time to tinker with some firmwares, hopefully I won&#039;t get called away however.<br />As for the SD/MMC; I think I found a suitable device:<a href="http://www.conrad.nl">product code 731133 - 89 on this site</a>.<br />It&#039;s a 4 in 1 card holder, but looks usable and it&#039;s not expensive either, if it&#039;s unusable no big loss, but the downside is I have to wait<br />roughly a week before I get it, but I digress.<br />Forgot to take the RAM home with me, so that will also have to wait.</p>									</div>

					<p>Brought the RAM home. It is a Kingston KVR400X64C3A/512, 8 chips double sided 512MB PC3200 CL3 184-pin module, not the exact same as <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Customizing/Hardware/RAM_upgrade">as seen here</a> as it&#039;s missing the &#039;S&#039; in the middle of &#039;X64C3A&#039;.</p>									</div>
