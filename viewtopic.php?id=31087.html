					<p>I had a DIR655 before and it always peaked at 11,2 MB/s when downloading at full speed. Now with a WNDR3700 and OpenWRT it only reaches 9,5-10 MB/sec. Just a note: before I installed OpenWRT I did a quick download test with the Netgear stock firmware. In this test I had the same slow peak speeds of 9,5-10 MB/sec. But I thought it probably was because of the factory settings (QOS enabled etc).. But after flashing OpenWRT I still had those speeds. </p><br /><p>I also found this thread:<br /><a href="http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r23357696-WNDR3700-vs-DIR855-file-transfer-speed">http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r233576 … sfer-speed</a><br />So it looks like this is hardware problem with Netgear routers?</p><br /><p>Are there any options in OpenWRT that can be disabled to improve the peak speed?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Alex24</strong> on 28 Jul 2011, 05:36)</p>

					<p>Huh? I thought the WNDR3700 was praised because of it&#039;s high performance CPU? The DIR-655 was introduced in 2007. How can it be that the Ubicom StreamEngine 5160 @ 220 Mhz is faster then the Atheros AR7161 @ 680Mhz? Is the difference in the architecture that big?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Alex24</strong> on 28 Jul 2011, 19:09)</p>

					<p>Found the problem. It was the IPTV settopbox. I configured this router for a friend (remotely), so i didn&#039;t knew they had that box running 24/7.

It only does ~7 mb/s max, while the d-link dir-655 did ~10 mb/s max.

At the most important part of the sentence you quit.

That modified part is closed source, so OpenWRT dev&#039;s need to reverse engineer this. This takes alot time and is probably also the reason of the slower speeds with OpenWRT (as the modified closed source part is not implemented in OpenWRT yet).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Alex24</strong> on 15 Aug 2011, 22:38)</p>
