					<p>I&#039;m trying to install OpenWrt on old Pentium 4 PC to use as a replacement for my router, by which i&#039;ve been very disappointed for quite some time.<br />I dd&#039;d this image <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05/x86/64/openwrt-15.05-x86-64-combined-ext4.img.gz">http://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calm … xt4.img.gz</a> and openwrt itself seems to be running fine, but it does not recognize any ethernet adapters.<br />Hardware is as follows:<br />CPU Pentium 4 3.0 GHz<br />HDD SATA 250Gb<br />ETH 2 different Acorp PCI cards, both with RTL8139D. (one is 9L100D, another is missing labeled sticker)<br />RAM 2x2 DDR2 553MHz.</p><p>This rig seems to be unable to boot from usb stick, so i connected hdd to my pc first and in cygwin ran<br />dd if=openwrt-15.05-x86-64-combined-ext4.img of=/dev/sde<br />Which created 2 partitions, as expected. Then attache HDD back to the router pc.<br />Now OpenWrt boots fine, but ifconfig only shows lo interface.<br />Am i missing certain software to make it work?<br />Motherboard has internal network card also, but it seems to be physically dead - cable connected to it does not get recognised as connected by other devices, even though it should be on according to BIOS settings.</p>									</div>

The reason I brought it up is that I&#039;ve been down the &quot;repurposing old hardware&quot; route myself a couple of times recently, before doing the calculations and realising that it would actually be cheaper in the long run to buy a shiny new bit of hardware. When it&#039;s running 24/7, power consumption can be a very significant factor in the equation.</p><p>The APU really is an excellent bit of kit - I bought one myself recently and I&#039;m very pleased with it.</p>									</div>

Let alone additional tasks i&#039;d like it to perform like running SMB shares, torrent-client and sandboxed http web server.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>Degeneratescum wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>A typical 3Ghz Pentium 4 system uses at least 100w at idle.

With USD/ruble exchange rate so low, it would cost 31$ to run 100w 24/365 at a highest energy price available. 24$ if account for cheaper price during nighttime.</p>									</div>
