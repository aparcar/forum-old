					<p>Hi,</p><p>I wonder If you can help me.</p><p>I have a 4G ISP Router connected via LAN cable to an OpenWRT Router (LAN Port).<br />The OpenWRT Router has an IP from the same subnet (192.168.1.2)<br />The WLAN/LAN clients get their IP from the ISP Router via DHCP. All works fine so far.</p><p>I want to setup a second/guest WLAN which should be separted from the 192.168.1.* network and should get an own IP range via DHCP.</p><p>First I tried to use this howto:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan</a><br />I could connect to the guest wlan but had no internet access. Do I need to setup some route to the ISP Router or did I miss a default gateway setting?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lars_</strong> on 20 Jul 2013, 20:43)</p>

					<p>If you goto firewall, zone settings there should be a Zone=&gt;Fowardings saying something on the lines of <br />&quot;GuestWifi&quot;=&gt;&quot;Wan&quot;</p><p>And it should work.</p><p>To start with have default rules <br />&quot;Input&quot; - &quot;Accept&quot;<br />&quot;Output&quot; - &quot;Accept&quot;<br />&quot;Forward&quot; - &quot;Reject&quot;</p><p>So you have no issues with DHCP, and then later narrow it down &quot;Input&quot; - &quot;Reject&quot; and custom traffic rules for DHCP etc.</p><p>I also found issues at first setting up with the DHCP, a mixture of router reboot and deleting the DHCP leases on the Android device I was testing with sorted it.</p><p>James</p>									</div>

Do you have Openwrt box set as bridge between ethernet and wifi? How did you set wan interface in networks? I presume my forward to wan isn&#039;t working as i don&#039;t have any wan interface...</p>									</div>
