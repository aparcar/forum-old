					<p>Hi all,</p><p>Is there anyway to set some pre-defined configs and recall them quickly using luci, for example if I wanted to switch an openwrt router from wifi-lan client mode to being a dumb ap, is there a quick way to just switch the configs?</p><p>TIA</p>									</div>

					<p>There is no &quot;button&quot; to push to convert between configs.&nbsp; It can be done with custom scripts, but you can take advantage of the backup and restore function.&nbsp; Create a &quot;router&quot; config, perform a backup thru Luci.&nbsp; It will save a file with a generic name to your desktop.&nbsp; Rename the file &quot;Router&quot;.&nbsp; Reconfigure the device to an ap and again make a backup and call the config &quot;AP&quot;.&nbsp; If you have USB configured on your router you can store the files right on a flash drive.&nbsp; You can then Restore the config file and reboot.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the reply, I have samba working on it so can access USB drives etc, is there anyway to store the backup to the internal memory rather than USB?</p>									</div>

					<p>Technically you can, but the files are not directly accessible from the backup and restore tool.</p><p>You would need to do this with scripts.</p>									</div>
