					<p><strong>Short Description:</strong><br />I am experiencing an enormous difficulty entering failsafe mode with this router (BELKIN F5D7230-4 v1000).<br />I have setup a static IP lan connection, having my card the suggested 192.168.1.2 IP, 255.255.255.0 Subnet and 192.168.1.1 Gateway (already tried with blank gateway). I can see with recvudp the packet that asks to press reset to enter failsafe mode, but no matter how hard I try or the timing I choose it never shows the message of &quot;entering failsafe&quot;.. it just keeps asking to press reset to enter failsafe mode. Is there any particular timing for this router?</p><p><strong>Long Description:</strong><br />I had my BELKIN F5D7230-4 v1000 running on DD-WRT v23SP2, though I decided to switch to OpenWRT. Given the similarities both in hardware and firmware with Linksys WRT54G (v1.0) I have chosen to upgrade the firmware with the &quot;openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin&quot; image, using the built-in DD-WRT firmware upgrade feature, choosing squashfs to have failsafe mode in case anything went wrong.</p><p>In the end of the process things did go wrong. The router wasn&#039;t functional, didn&#039;t have DHCP or telnet, but the leds were showing life. I decided to proceed according to the failsafe instructions in order to get this router back on track, but I simply can&#039;t get pass the &quot;press reset to enter failsafe&quot; stage. I have tried to ping both 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.255 addresses without success.</p><p>Given the lack of success with failsafe mode, I tried to TFTP back the DD-WRT firmware, also without success. I just couldn&#039;t get the router to flash back the firmware.<br />I need the community expertise to acknowledge me if there is any particular timing for this router and/or if JTAG is the best solution from now.</p><p>Thanks for your time!</p>									</div>
