					<p>Hello, I&#039;m trying to get OpenWRT working on a router I&#039;ve been given for this task.&nbsp; a F5D8230-4 Ver 1002</p><p>This model is listed as Untested. This unit has identical hardware to the&nbsp; Linksys WRT54GX also Pre-N</p><br /><p>I can load the trx via the tftp during its boot up but I can not access it after that.&nbsp; I can not telnet nor ssh to it.&nbsp; I get a few different messages during its start, I&#039;m using wireshark to see any messages.</p><p>I get a gratuitous arp for 192.168.2.1 then I&#039;ll get a few packets that wireshark says is WCCP then nothing for a bit and after that nothing but DHCP Discovery Requests.&nbsp; Thats very confusing.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried putting it on a network with DHCP to see if it would accpet an address and that was not successful.</p><br /><p>I&#039;m going to flash back to the belkin software and do a factory reset and then try openwrt again in hopes that maybe some weird settings were left in NVRAM by the belkin software.</p><br /><p>Any suggestions?<br />I&#039;ve tried the latest witerussian, kamikaze, and distros from x-wrt as well.&nbsp; same issue all around.</p><br /><p>I&#039;m on windows but I&#039;ve similar with the command line and I know a little linux.</p><p>any suggestions?</p>									</div>
