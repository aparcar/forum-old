					<p>Anyone successful with upgrading a Routeboard 532 to Chaos Calmer RC3?&nbsp; I have attempted with the following result.&nbsp; This is the result from the console:</p><p>RouterBOOT booter 2.18</p><p>RouterBoard 532</p><p>CPU frequency: 399 MHz<br />&nbsp; Memory size:&nbsp; 32 MB</p><p>Press any key within 2 seconds to enter setup..<br />loading kernel from nand... OK<br />setting up elf image... OK<br />jumping to kernel code<br />Starting...</p><br /><p>Not output on console after the Starting... message, so I&#039;m not sure what is happening.&nbsp; I waited for about 5 minutes and then tried to ping all 3 interfaces with 192.168.1.1 and received no response.&nbsp; I then dhcp booted an old image I had used to originally install.&nbsp; I mounted&nbsp; the two mtd partitions and I have a kernel file in the first one and the root filesystem in the second.&nbsp; In an attempt to determine whether the issue was the kernel or the root filesystem I installed an older 3.3.0-rc6 kernel I had used in the past into the 1st partition and rebooted.&nbsp; With the I can now access the Chaos Calmer root filesystem!!!&nbsp; So it appears that the RC3 root image has some type of problem, but the fact that it does not output to the console makes it impossible to determine where the issue is.</p><p>Does anyone have a clue what I would need to change in the configuration to re-allow the console output when rebuilding a kernel image from the Chaos Calmer branch?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Ray</p>									</div>

					<p>when you compiled the CC image did you change the default serial baud rate?<br />the router boot on the RB532 uses 115200, an unchanged stock compile would use 38400 i believe (been a while since I&#039;ve rolled my own.)</p><p>you can either re-compile with the change or just switch your terminal program to the correct baud rate at the point it stops displaying output.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>christineedadrink</strong> on 19 Aug 2015, 02:06)</p>

					<p>Ok I got it. Aparently the correct kernel is not -vmlinux but rather the ext4.kernel and squashfs.kernel variants.</p><p>I wonder why downloads.openwrt.org lists only vmlinux. Shouldnt it include all of them?</p>									</div>
