					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m an openwrt newbie.&nbsp; I am using an Openwrt router functioning as my gateway on my home network.&nbsp; For the purpose of clarity i will say that the network uses an&nbsp; address of 192.168.1.0/24.&nbsp; The Openwrt router is at an address of 192.168.1.1/24.&nbsp; My roommate has a Sonicwall VPN router connected to my network, via its WAN connection, with a static ip of 192.168.1.22/24. It is using my Openwrt router as its default gateway. </p><p>My roommate can VPN out, but would like to vpn back into his home pc.&nbsp; His router is set up to forward the proper ports and it worked at his old apartment.&nbsp; I need to forward port 500 from the WAN connection of the Openwrt router to 192.168.1.22.</p><p>I am having trouble finding or understanding the examples of how to perform this.&nbsp; I would appreciate any assistance setting up the proper firewall and forwarding rules.</p><p>Thank You,<br />Sam</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>that should be fairly easy. On OpenWRT Kamikaze add this to the file &quot;/etc/config/firewall&quot;:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config redirect
    option src            wan
    option src_dport    500
    option dest            lan
    option dest_ip        192.168.1.22
    option dest_port    500
    option proto        tcp</code></pre></div><p>On the older WhiteRussian use iptables directly in the file &quot;/etc/firewall.user&quot;:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -t nat -A prerouting_rule -i $WAN -p tcp --dport 500 -j DNAT --to 192.168.1.22
iptables        -A forwarding_rule -i $WAN -p tcp --dport 500 -d 192.168.1.22 -j ACCEPT</code></pre></div><p>Notice: if your VPN uses udp instead of tcp you have to replace all &quot;tcp&quot; with &quot;udp&quot; in the code above.<br />If you don&#039;t know just try <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
