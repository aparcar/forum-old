					<p>Hi, I have just set up my router, which is 15.05.1.<br />After I plugged in the cable and connected my device to the router, I found out that I can access Internet, such as Google or something, but I cannot access some of our school&#039;s website.</p><p>I tried to ping our school website on the router, which is fine. However, when it comes to my devices, it did not work out.<br />Any help?</p><p>Update:<br />Discard upstream RFC1918 responses solves the problem.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Icarus_Radio</strong> on 5 Nov 2017, 16:53)</p>
