					<p>Hi,<br />I&#039;ve build a firmware from the Aug 19 CVS repository.<br />I&#039;ve build pppoecd in the firmware (along with openssh and zlib). Everything seems to work fine, ppp0 is up (from a pppoe link). <br />If I run &quot;ipkg update&quot;, I get a segmentation fault.<br />If I ping an internal address, everything is ok. If I try one through the ppp0 link, the router reboots (maybe because of the watchdog).</p><p>My linksys is the latest WRT54G version (the one with vlan0 and vlan1).</p><p>I&#039;ve seen no reference about that. Is there something known ?</p>									</div>
