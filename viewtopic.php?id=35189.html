					<p>Hi All,</p><p>I have a WNDR3700 and experiencing slow wireless performance on both 2.4ghz and 5ghz radios. I tried every setting/combination for both radios and can&#039;t seem to break 130Mbps on my clients (averaging 52-78Mbps). Coming from the stock firmware I was hitting 270-300Mbps constantly. </p><p>The signal quality and range are great but poor speed. I went as far as removing/installing latest Intel 6230 drives on my notebook.</p><p>Is there something with the particular firmware or router I am using? Can anyone with a WNDR3700 chime in and shed some light with settings that work for them? How does the WNDR3800 stack up?</p><p>Current firmware: OpenWrt Firmware Attitude Adjustment (r30486) / LuCI Trunk (trunk+svn8223)</p><p>Any direction or advice is much appreciated. Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>You have to enable HT40 to go over 130Mbps. Note that it is not allowed if the AP detects other AP&#039;s in the area with overlapping channels.</p>									</div>

					<p>@dsmero: see <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless</a> and add option &#039;noscan&#039; &#039;1&#039; to the wifi-device section in /etc/config/wireless. Then do &quot;wifi down;wifi up&quot; from the command line.</p>									</div>
