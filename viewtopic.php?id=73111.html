					<p>Hello People of Openwrt, I post there because I found a very old brand New router which shares the processor (Atheros ar2317) With the D-link Dir-300 and I Would like to know if some image of Openwrt for this router, I dissarmed the router and took a photo of the motherboard and the box package of this router</p>									</div>

					<p>That is the router in One piece With its box, the company is apparently dead, the router itself ressembles the old style tp link router, but things like the hardware doesn&#039;t appear nowhere, it is a very poppular router here in Venezuela and in South América believe it or not, I could not find a thing about the router in ddwrt, tomate and even there in openwrt, even lanpro as a company is nowhere to be found in the custom firmware World, I believe it is a chinese or low budget clone of another router, but I think People like the experts around openwrt forums are the Ones That can tell me What I do have and What can be done for it, thanks for any help That you can provide People</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>JohnKCG</strong> on 30 Jan 2018, 06:16)</p>

					<p>No way anything like OpenWrt can work with 8 MB RAM.&nbsp; Those routers with small memory used special proprietary non-Linux operating systems.</p><p>As far as what you could do with it, you&#039;d have to start by replacing the RAM chip, and likely the flash is only 2 MB as well.&nbsp; Going through such extensive modifications to end up with a b/g router with no USB or anything isn&#039;t worth it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 30 Jan 2018, 15:04)</p>

					<p>The SDRAM (single data rate) chips in x16 width are kind of hard to find.&nbsp; You can take chips off of an old module like this one:<br /><a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/256MB-PC133-133Mhz-SODIMM-133-SDRAM-144Pin-memory-Laptop-Notebook-8Chipset-RAM/221170090155?_trkparms=aid%3D222007%26algo%3DSIM.MBE%26ao%3D2%26asc%3D49917%26meid%3Dae55cedfb94c405288d6f1a937c5d6af%26pid%3D100005%26rk%3D5%26rkt%3D6%26mehot%3Dag%26sd%3D173031352534%26itm%3D221170090155&amp;_trksid=p2047675.c100005.m1851">https://www.ebay.com/itm/256MB-PC133-13 … 0005.m1851</a><br />This unit has eight chips of 32 MB each, and importantly, 16 bits wide per chip. This type of chip is found only in laptop style (SODIMM) modules.&nbsp; A desktop PC133 DIMM with eight chips on each side of the board is going to be eight bits per chip, those chips do not work in routers.&nbsp; There were SDR chips with 512 Mb (64 MB) per chip, but those are extremely rare.</p><p>Once you have the larger RAM on the board, I think most Atheros bootloaders will auto-detect it, but you may need to look into resistor strapping or bootloader modification to actually use the 32 MB.</p><p>Again I point out that this should be undertaken not as a serious project, since even if successful, what you will end up with is a router having a slow CPU, b/g wireless, and 32 MB of RAM.&nbsp; That&#039;s not a machine to show off what OpenWrt can do.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 31 Jan 2018, 15:42)</p>

					<p>Well, here in Venezuela you can find very very old Tech, talking about pentium 2 and even Motorola processor,&nbsp; so finding modules like That should not be That difficult, I know That this project won&#039;t give me a super router to rival cisco top router, but again, this is Just for studing and learning, my main objective is to give more redundancy and bandwith to my network, my main router is a tp link w841nd With open wrt, I readed That the Atheros Was capable of overclocking, I have a thermal band used to do overclocking on smartphone, maybe With That we can get some more perforan e?</p>									</div>
