					<p>Hi.</p><p>I have created a couple of tunnels on HE.net according to the autogenerated config, however the dynamic IPv4 endpoint is not being updated.</p><p>I traced it back to the password being sent as MD5 sum instead of as-is. However there is no Trak ticket for this so I am inclined to think I made a mistake somewhere.</p><p>Is anyone else experiencing a similar issue? It might be worth noting that the &quot;update key&quot; in my HE webpanel is filled in.</p>									</div>
