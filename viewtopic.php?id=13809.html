					<p>Hello world!</p><p>I&#039;ve got a box here which behaves quite oddly. It boots fine. I already put a firmware on it a long time ago. Now I want to put on a new one but I can&#039;t. I can&#039;t figure out which IP the router responds to, while in debug mode (slowly flashing powerled). It&#039;s neither 192.168.1.1 nor the IP the router listens on while in normal mode.</p><p>I messed around with the nvram some time ago. Could it be that debug mode does not work properly if the nvram is a little screwed up?</p>									</div>

					<p>hm i suppose nvram has something to do with it.<br />i thought it might be a goof idea to sort of copy paste the nvram from another box. i did that by &quot;nvram unset&quot;-ing each and every line from the nvram, then dumping the other nvram with nvram show &gt;/tmp/nvram<br />I then copied /tmp/nvram to the box with the blank nvram and imported it with<br />for i in `cat /tmp/nvram`; do nvram set $i;done<br />after a nvram commit i rebootet the box. it&#039;s dead now openwrt is obviously starting b/c i can put it into failsafe mode (ez-setup-buton). in failsafe mode i can ping the box at 192.168.1.1 but i can&#039;t neither telnet nor ssh into it. normalmode is as dead as debugmode</p>									</div>
