					<p>Evening-</p><p>I started this thread over on the general forum in regards to the Linksys RE6400 Extender.&nbsp; It has a nice ethernet port and I had intended on converting it to an Access Point for the upstairs.&nbsp; I&#039;m having a heck of a time getting into the uboot though- I finally got the BOOTP broadcast by holding down the reset, typing 1234567890, and releasing it.&nbsp; Odd server/client IPs, too.</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=71182">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=71182</a></p><p>I do have a chip programmer and I&#039;ve dumped the contents of the original.&nbsp; I can also program or modify it as needed, so if there&#039;s another close uboot I could use that is a bit friendlier without the password I&#039;d be even happier.</p><p>I still am working on getting openwrt to build properly in my environment (ubuntu, virtual).&nbsp; Suggestions welcome there for the mediatek chips.</p><p>Thanks ever so much.</p>									</div>
