					<p>are u still porting openwrt&nbsp; to this? These boxes are extreemly cheap: $59 but the current implementation is very poor and useless.. you need a client etc to access the drives. Can you imagine this beeing an open os... this would be the perfect NAS!</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, I spend some time guessing the 20 pin header, and I found the serial Tx and after a lot more time, the Rx. The Rx took so much longer, because if I connected it before powerup, the device would not in fact power up. Possibly the Rx is also a JTAG function, and the 3.3V idle of my cable&#039;s Tx triggers some JTAG function or something. So, I have to connect the power and then quickly connect the cable&#039;s Tx to the device Rx and press Esc. Or, if I was too slow, wait for a full VxWorks boot (about a minute), and then type the command reboot ...</p><p>This is what I found:</p><p>10 = RxD<br />14 = TxD<br />11 = Reset (or behaves so)<br />12,15,18,19,20 = GND</p><p>all others I wrote the measured average signal level</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>   0V signal   1  2  3.3V signal
 3.2V signal   3  4  3.3V signal
   0V signal   5  6  3.3V signal
 3.2V signal   7  8  3.3V signal
 3.2V signal   9 10  RxD
       Reset  11 12  GND
 3.2V signal  13 14  TxD
         GND  15 16  3.2V signal
   0V signal  17 18  GND
         GND  19 20  GND

The square pin is of course pin 1 and is the one closest to the crystal</code></pre></div><p>So you can nicely connect the serial to the row of pins 10,12,14</p><p>Next to see if I can compile or find an AR7 image small enough to fit in 2Mb<br />If anyone has experiance with the PSPBoot or TI AR7, and can hint me at some does or donts or obvious or less obvious traps, feel free. Some relevant device data is shown in the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Netgear/SC101">SC101 data page</a>.</p>									</div>

					<p>Anyone have any luck with this yet? I have one of these expensive paper weights. Netgear did produce a real pile of s**t when they made the software for this. Anyway....</p><p>Anyone got anything to run on it? What are the main limitations? </p><p>Is it the 2MB of flash? I was thinking of replacing the flash chip with a larger one, the largest I can get hold of is 8MB.

					<p>There is another alternative which would be functional.<br />I found sc101-nbd to be fully working and also makes it use the ext fs on it. Yes you can NOT use it with the Netgear original software in windows making it impossible for windows clients to use it at all.</p><p>But think, install sc101-nbd in openwrt, enable samba/ftp or your preferred network sharing and voila.</p><p>I saw that one named zeropain converted the source to openwrt but all references to him is gone.<br />Also i tried to make one my selves but it isnt working and i have requested help on the subject here:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=41120">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=41120</a></p>									</div>
