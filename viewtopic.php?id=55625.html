					<p>Hi, I installed openwrt on RB951g-2hnd. Now,I want to upgrade firmware. But sysupgrade doesn&#039;t work for mikrotik device. I have to boot from initramfs to be able to rewrite partitions data (rootfs + kernel). I have serial access to uart, but unfortunately there&#039;re no bios options. The only option I see is install routerOs, change boot device and go on. But here&#039;s a tricky part I have changed boot protocol to bootp and netinstall doesn&#039;t see my router now ( just before this operation netinstall found routerboard perfectly) Is there anything I can do from openwrt to change boot device or upgrade system in another way? Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>

I mean I can&#039;t boot from tftp over ethernet, because the router tries nand first.&nbsp; Same with serial, but I&#039;ll give it a try.</p>									</div>
