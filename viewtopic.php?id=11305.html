					<p>Hi guys...</p><p>i&#039;ve been looking around trying to sort out a problem. Chillispot v1.0 as the one compiled for opewrt, comes aparently with a bug on the redirection after login successfull. The bug is basically, de variable $userurl is not passed on and so the landing login page will not redirect the user properly. The post on the&nbsp; chillispot forum post is:</p><p><a href="http://www.chillispot.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8605#8605">http://www.chillispot.org/forum/viewtop â€¦ =8605#8605</a></p><p>SurferTim provides a chilli.c and a redir.c for chillispot v1.0 to be compiled with, on that same post.</p><p>So what i would like to ask you guys is, because of my not so advanced know how, i cannot compile it for opewrt and so, if you guys are willing to do that, or at least have a look at it, just in case there is a workaround that problem. Which in fact is no a problem using hotspotlogin.cgi provided with chillispot v1.0 (i dont understabd why it redirects if there is no variable passed on bu ok) and using another customized uam page it will not get the variable and so redirection... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>Thanks in advance guys.<br />Xpatal</p>									</div>

					<p>Is this bug already fixed in ChilliSpot 1.1?&nbsp; At least on the WR 0.9 box I checked, the Chilli that was loaded there using the ipkg command was the 1.1 version.</p>									</div>
