					<p>I have an Asus AAM6020VI (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Asus/AAM6020VI">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har â€¦ /AAM6020VI</a>) AR7 based router that I&#039;m keen to start testing current builds of OpenWRT on.</p><p>Managed to take some photos of the board and thanks to another AR7 related site I now know where the serial connection is.</p><p>The board has 4MB Rom and 16MB Ram so should be a reasonably flexible box providing I can bootstrap it. Also at present I&#039;ve migrated it from the official firmware to the routertech.org firmware which provides additional features, and fixes a number of GUI bugs.</p><p>My first question is what files do I need to revert to the original firmware via PSPBoot if I hit a problem.</p><p>Secondly will any of the existing AR7 pre-built firmwares work on my hardware, or do I need to do a custom build.</p><p>There appear to be a couple of linksys AR7 devices with PSPBoot but they don&#039;t have the wireless of my Asus.</p><p>Any help would be really appreciated.</p>									</div>
