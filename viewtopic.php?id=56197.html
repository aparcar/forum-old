					<p>Hi,</p><p>We have a small old building which we are converting into a rural tourism and we have already deployed 3 Wifi access points. The problem is that walls are really thick and the Wifi signal really suffers from that. Since there&#039;s no way for us to run cables through the building we already have the access points connected through powerline and it works really well.</p><p>I&#039;ve been looking to powerline Wifi access points (I would go to TP-Link or Devolo) to deploy inside the bedrooms but their configurations are rather limited. Our access points use OpenWrt and we need to have that in every access point we have in the building so that I can deploy the same configurations across access points.<br />I&#039;ve search through the Internet but couldn&#039;t find anyone who tried to put OpenWrt in one of these. Can&#039;t it be done? Would we need the cooperation of the device maker?</p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />you might want to look at a D-Link DHP-1565; there is a patch to enable the internal switch port to the PLC controller for OpenWRT:</p>									</div>

					<p>Are you talking about this one: <a href="https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/583299/">https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/583299/</a> ? Changes were requested but it seems it wasn&#039;t sent again. And are you sure that&#039;s the only thing that&#039;s needed? It would work just like any other port?</p><p>Anyway, that product seems to be phased out (<a href="http://www.dlink.com/pt/pt/support/product/dhp-1565-wireless-n-powerline-gigabit-router">http://www.dlink.com/pt/pt/support/prod â€¦ bit-router</a>) and it&#039;s an entire router, not an access point.</p><p>We still haven&#039;t solved our issue, so thank you very much for your input!</p>									</div>
