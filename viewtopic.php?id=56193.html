					<p>Hello, I am a pretty much complete noob in regards with Open Wrt and this is also my first post on this forum. After searching far and wide over the internet, I haven&#039;t managed to find the solution to my problem, hence I decided posting it here.</p><p>I have a Tp-link router, as the topic&#039;s name would suggest and I have somehow managed to brick it (or so it seems). All the LEDs are working, but the router doesn&#039;t respond to any ping requests. Using wireshark, if&#039;ve found it does not send any packets at all. When I plug a lan cable in port 4, however, it restarts (Entering failsafe mode doesn&#039;t work either. I have the non sys led model)<br />and is then stuck on the restart cycle. This only happens on port 4. I can ping the router on it&#039;s 192.168.1.1 address just shortly, after I boot it up. I have tried using TFTP server, with no luck what so ever. Telnet and ssh also does not seem to be working. Not even in the short pingable interval.</p><p>Does anyone have a clue on what the heck is going on here? Also sorry if I managed to screw up the posting section...</p><p>Thank you for you asnwers <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>1NFuSeD</strong> on 10 Mar 2015, 19:46)</p>

					<p>I would usually use a ttl converter and recovery via serial, but in reading the wiki (found here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd#v9_without_serial)">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl- … ut_serial)</a> it seems you can recover it using the tftp method with out a serial connection</p><br /><p>here &#039;s is the factory bin <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr841n-v9-squashfs-factory.bin">https://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_b … actory.bin</a></p><p>you need to rename it&nbsp; &quot;wr841nv9_tp_recovery.bin&quot; as per step 2 below</p><p>from the wiki...<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>v9 (without serial)

As most other current TP-Link routers this device can be flashed and debricked without serial access. Basically, the procedure is as follows:

1.    Set your PC to use the static IP address 192.168.0.66 (the router will have 192.168.0.86)
2.    Put an OpenWrt factory image named wr841nv9_tp_recovery.bin in the root directory of an TFTP server and start it
3.    Power on the router while pressing the reset button until the lock LED is lighting up
4.   Wait for the router to reboot

For details, see reset_button_method_no_serial_cable_needed</code></pre></div><p>good luck</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hostle19</strong> on 10 Mar 2015, 17:02)</p>

					<p>I have tried that already, with the difference bein I didn&#039;t rename the .bin file. Well, I repeated this step with no success. What I find funny is that the router can actually ping on 192.168.1.1 for a very short time, before it boots. The reboot cycle also only happens on port 4...</p><p>Thank you for your reply!</p><br /><p>Edit: Does anyone know, how to even get into fail safe, since there is no system led on this model? I can&#039;t really seem to figure it out...</p><p>Edit 2: I think this happened when I manually tried to add a wifi device, but somewhat added a LAN device (in gui mode).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>1NFuSeD</strong> on 10 Mar 2015, 19:47)</p>

					<p>I do not have that led. This is a different model. The led next to the power led is the wifi led. </p><p>I managed to get it working, anyhow. I&#039;ve plugged it into another router, which in terms used DHCP to add an IP to the TPlink router. Being on the same subnet (DHCP leases do give you IP in the same subnet) I managed to up a ssh connection. Using the firstboot command and later telneting, I&#039;ve successfully restored the router to it&#039;s default state.</p><p>Trouble is, and I can&#039;t emphasie this enough, this is a strange model. I&#039;ve googled all around, but every model does have a sys led (yes, the gear icon thingie ), so I had no clue how to tell if my router is in failsafe mode or not... I thought the D (TPLink for detachable antennas) was the problem and since my model does not have detachable antennas, the led config might&#039;ve been different too. But I guess&nbsp; not.</p><p>Well, thank you for all your help anyhow <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> Just happy I managed to unbrick this sucker.</p>									</div>

					<p>well usually you can understand you are in failsafe mode from the fact you get ping reply (and telnet) on 192.168.1.1.</p><p>obviously your pc NIC must have a valid fixed ip for example 192.168.1.2.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nebbia88</strong> on 10 Mar 2015, 23:07)</p>
