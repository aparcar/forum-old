					<p>I can&#039;t think of any reason why a different flash chip wouldn&#039;t work, unless flash and nvram are are different physical chips.</p><p>That said, soldering SOP pins is a pain, and a new router is $50.</p>									</div>

					<p>i am not sure about all this JTAG-stuff, but wouldn&#039;t it be easier to use a serial adapter to check what is really going on, before messing everything up with JTAG? i have bricked my router several times, but all i need to fix it was a serial adapter.... so before damaging CFE or other important things you may like to take a closer look first?!</p>									</div>

					<p>to clear everything up, you may want to install the original linksys firmware. so you can be sure, that everything is ok with the bootloader and the device in general</p>									</div>
