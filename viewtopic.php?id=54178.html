					<p>Everything&#039;s stock, other than the changing the LAN IP address, enabling both WiFi channels (2.4GHz and 5GHz), setting their SSIDs and wireless keys, and adding the wiki&#039;s &quot;sleep 2 &amp;&amp; /etc/init.d/network restart&quot; to the startup address.</p><p>But, when I do a speedtest.net test, all other things staying the same, I used to constantly get average download speeds of 100-110Mbps, I now struggle to get 85Mbps on my Mac Book Pro.&nbsp; If I connect with an ethernet cable, both before changing over, and now, I get around 125Mbps.</p><p>Obviously 85Mbps is more than acceptable and if it&#039;s just some funkiness to something about having OpenWRT on it, I will accept that due to allllllll of the benefits of OpenWRT over the stock firmware, but I wanted to ask the question in case it&#039;s a setting, or option I can fiddle with to get it performing to it&#039;s best again.</p>									</div>

					<p>Okey doke, seems like AA is the way to go until this is sorted, if you&#039;re not worried about LED control, which I&#039;m not, but I can&#039;t see a build for the rt-n56u from AA, <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09/ramips/rt3883/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_a … ps/rt3883/</a> and as for trying CC / one of the snapshot builds, I did try them earlier and the router didn&#039;t even boot <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /></p><p>Reason I actually tried those other builds were to do with the *other* wireless problem reported with some of these builds, everything wireless just timing out at least once a day, sometimes every few hours.&nbsp; Not going well for me with OpenWRT at the moment, which is a real shame.&nbsp; It&#039;s my own fault for not researching what router to get, but I get so frustrated using stock firmware.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yep, no matter what I try to do, 5G won&#039;t rename <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" />&nbsp; I&#039;ve gone through every setting of 20MHz, 40MHz (with and without &#039;force&#039;) and turning WMM mode on and off, and for whatever reason, it won&#039;t turn on / the SSID won&#039;t show up on any device.</p><p>I have, however turned 40MHz on, forced, with WMM Mode, with the same name for both channels, and gotten my speed up to 90MBps.</p><p>Gah, it feels like this build is just fairly ropey unfortunately.&nbsp; I can&#039;t even set a damn password on the thing.&nbsp; If there were a decent 12.09 build that was good for this router, I&#039;d try that, but if there&#039;s no more problems, what I have is better than stock, and I am actually happy with it, so I&#039;ll stop tweaking.</p>									</div>

					<p>Do you mean trying the latest snapshot, or the Barrier Breaker one?&nbsp; For the Barrier Breaker, I 100% flashed the factory one, <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ramips/rt3883/openwrt-ramips-rt3883-rt-n56u-squashfs-factory.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_br … actory.bin</a> as is stated in the wiki, <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/asus/rt-n56u.">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/asus/rt-n56u.</a>&nbsp; For the latest snapshot, now that you mention it, I&#039;m not 100% sure, I may have mistakenly chosen a sysupgrade.&nbsp; Will double check when I get home.</p>									</div>

					<p>you only need the factory file for the initial flash. If you used that first, you should be ok to use a sysupgrade going to trunk. i would try going back to 14.07.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah, so I&#039;ve gone back to stock.&nbsp; I&#039;d suggest that 14.07 shouldn&#039;t be down as &quot;good&quot; or even &quot;ok&quot; for the rt-n56u.&nbsp; Maybe it&#039;s just a ropey build that I got, but overall it was just pretty unstable in too many ways.&nbsp; Wireless would shut down / router would crash on a lot of wireless traffic / load (requiring a reboot), I couldn&#039;t set the password on the router at all, configuration changes to the wireless channels were all wonky too, with many settings not taking at all, and then lastly the speed nearly 50MBps compared to what I had on stock (and have again now, 70-75MBps on OpenWRT and straight away 122MBps now again).</p><p>Is there somewhere I can give &quot;official&quot; feedback for the wiki?&nbsp; Having 14.07 as supported certainly gave me the wrong impression as to what I&#039;d be getting, I&#039;d put it as beta at the best, if not alpha.</p>									</div>
