					<p>I have a &quot;strange&quot; problem with dns queries on my system.</p><p>My current hardware setup is that I have connected the WAN side to my existing network (192.168.2.1/24), where I have a local bind dns server handling all dns queries (This is just a test setup, I need to have everything configured, before I make the switch in wireless routers)</p><p>The problem is that clients attached to my router, can resolve hosts on the internet. But it can not resolve hosts handed by the DNS server that is in front of my router.</p><p>If I ssh into the router, and try pinging a host, that should be handled by the following dns server, it resolves it right..</p><p>Anyone that could help out here?</p><p>/ Thomas</p>									</div>
