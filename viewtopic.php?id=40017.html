I wanted to be able to &#039;unlock&#039; it from this network.</p><p>I downloaded Kamikaze 7.09 and sucessfully installed it but it has no web interface and I will never be able to get it working like this... I have been able to telnet into it and there appears to be a menu there but I have no diea where to go from here.</p><p>How can I load up generic Linksys firmware from this point, or something that has a web interface that I will be able to understand? I have read about whiterussian? Will this help me on this router? It is a v1.1</p><p>Please help!</p><p>thank you in advance for your assistance!</p>									</div>
