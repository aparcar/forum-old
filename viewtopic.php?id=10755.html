					<p>I am a first time OpenWRT user (and this is my first post). So far, I really like it. I&#039;m using it without any GUI and that suits the Linux geek in me just fine.</p><p>I was running a different 3rd-party firmware (DD-WRT v23 SP3 beta) on my Buffalo WHR-HP-G54 and running it as a &quot;wireless access point&quot;, to just bridge the wireless onto my LAN. I wanted to switch to OpenWRT. This is what I did:</p><p>***I spent an afternoon reading the OpenWRT documentation.***<br />THEN:</p><p>The unit had an IP of 192.168.1.3, so I:</p><p>Configured my PC NIC with an IP of 192.168.1.15.<br />Connected a cable between a lan port on the Buffalo and my PC NIC.<br />Did a tftp install of the latest version of WhiteRussian.<br />Telnet&#039;d into the unit and ran: mtd -r erase nvram</p><p>After it rebooted, the Buffalo came up on Buffalo&#039;s default IP of 192.168.11.1, so I:</p><p>Configured my PC NIC with an IP of 192.168.11.2.<br />I telnet&#039;d in again and ran the following:</p><p>passwd<br />cd /etc/init.d<br />rm S35firewall S50httpd S50telnet S60cron S60dnsmasq<br />nvram set lan_ipaddr=192.168.1.3<br />nvram set lan_gateway=192.168.1.1<br />nvram set lan_dns=192.168.1.1<br />nvram set wan_proto=none<br />nvram set vlan0ports=&quot;0 1 2 3 4 5*&quot;<br />nvram set vlan1ports=5<br />nvram set wl0_closed=0<br />nvram set wl0_channel=1<br />nvram set wl0_macmode=allow<br />nvram set wl0_maclist=&quot;&lt;space separated list of allowed MAC addresses&gt;&quot;<br />nvram set wl0_akm=psk2<br />nvram set wl0_crypto=aes<br />nvram set wl0_wpa_psk=&quot;&lt;my passphrase&gt;&quot;<br />nvram set wl0_auth=0<br />nvram commit<br />reboot</p><p>While it rebooted, I connected it, via it&#039;s WAN port (really a LAN port now) to my LAN, and reconfigured my PC for DHCP and put it back on my network. When the Buffalo was back up, I:</p><p>Ssh&#039;d in to the unit and ran:</p><p>ipkg update<br />ipkg install nas<br />ipkg install ntpclient<br />ipkg install openntpd</p><p>Lastly, I used vi to create an /etc/TZ file, with contents of: EST5EDT,M3.2.0,M11.1.0<br />and I rebooted one last time.</p><p>Now I have a very nicely working, slim AP.</p><p>However, when I used KisMAC to view my network, I noticed something odd. My main router and my other three APs - which are still running DD-WRT (they&#039;ll get switched later) - show up as using WPA, as I would expect. My OpenWRT AP seems to show up as using both WEP &amp; WPA, as it keeps changing back and forth between the two, in KisMAC.</p><p>This leads me to believe that I might be running in mixed mode, rather than in G-only mode (which is what I want).</p><p>I have two questions:</p><p>How do I set it to G-only mode?<br />Where can I find advanced documentation on all the wl0_* (and related) nvram variables? The documentation I looked at seemed to only cover the most basic needed to get the wireless up and running. Perhaps there&#039;s a section I missed? Feel free to point me at it.</p>									</div>
