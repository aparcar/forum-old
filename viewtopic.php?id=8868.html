					<p>One of my fellows had a problem with his kids, they were constantly using msn messenger and they began to atract possibly older people more and more and therefore this friend of mine got a little worried about his children. Children around us are warned about contacting people they don&#039;t know, but specificly they are being told to NOT tell too much intel about theirselves, do not tell where you are about to hang out and so on. And specificly do not send pictures and so on to these people if they ask for.. hmm.. certain kind of pictures..</p><p>Well, thing about kids is propably same thing as with my dogs, they get along pretty nicely when I&#039;m around but for example, if I leave a pizza to the table and tell my dogs to stay away from it, they&#039;ll play along. If I suddenly decide to leave and pizza&#039;s still on the table, I can say goodbye to it. Kids do as their parents say when they are around, but when they are alone, they might feel themselves alonely and so on and for all kinds of sick people out there, it&#039;s pretty easy to seduce kids when they want company, atleast I think so.</p><p>So I came to think about this thing a bit and did some google searches and found what I was after, a msn messenger sniffer which is able to capture messages sent and received with messenger. So I compiled it for openwrt and it works pretty nicely.</p><p>Using this program brings a little ethical problems if you use it for wrong purposes, I understand if it&#039;s for children&#039;s safety or so on, but spying for e.g. your employees.. Well, I wish this isn&#039;t going to be used for such.</p><p>I made a little website for it, which is accessible at <a href="http://www.roadrunner.cx/openwrt">http://www.roadrunner.cx/openwrt</a></p><p>Where you can be able to download it, maybe someone creates a package of it. It only requires libpcap..</p><p>Little end-note:<br />yeah, unfortunately my friend doesn&#039;t have a router capable of running openwrt on his home, so he ain&#039;t gonna be using this, but maybe someone else needs it and this saves some time..</p>									</div>
