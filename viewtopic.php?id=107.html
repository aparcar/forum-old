					<p>Maybe this information is of use to someone, so I&#039;ll write it down. Maybe it has been mentioned elsewhere already, but you&#039;ll have to forgive me then. Better an abundance of information than a shortage, eh?</p><p>- Download the latest version of the iPKG tools from <a href="ftp://ftp.handhelds.org/packages/ipkg-utils/">ftp://ftp.handhelds.org/packages/ipkg-utils/</a> (version 1.7 seems to be the latest);<br />- untar the archive, cd into the just untarred directory, and type &#039;make install&#039; (make sure you&#039;re root);<br />- open /usr/local/bin/ipkg-build, find the line where it says &quot;outer=ar&quot; (line 159 in version 1.7), and change &quot;ar&quot; into &quot;tar&quot;;</p><p>That sets up your build environment. From here on it&#039;s pretty straightforward. To create a package copy everything you want in it into a directory, in the directorystructure it needs to be on the target device. Also, you need to create a control file with some meta data about the package, and it has to live in the CONTROL directory. e.g. Say I have a binary, foo, and I need it to be available as /bin/foo on the target device. The&nbsp; procedure would be something like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mkdir -p /tmp/foo/bin
cp foo /tmp/foo/bin
mkdir -p /tmp/foo/CONTROL
cat &gt;/tmp/foo/CONTROL/control &lt;&lt;EOF
Package: foo
Version: 0.1
Architecture: mipsel
Maintainer: foo bar &lt;foo@bar.com&gt;
Section: base
Priority: optional
Description: This package provides foo, which does nothing.
Source: http://foo.bar/foo
EOF
ipkg-build -o root -g root /tmp/foo /tmp</code></pre></div><p>The result will be a package /tmp/foo-0.1_mipsel.ipk, which is ready to install on a standard openwrt distribution.</p><p>If modifying your ipkg environment is not an option, there&#039;s the possibility to modify your openwrt installation.<br />A standard ipkg-build produces packages which are basically two tarballs put together with &quot;ar&quot;. In a standard openwrt, busybox is compiled without support for &quot;ar&quot;, so to use standard iPKG packages in openwrt this has to be compiled back in. Modify buildroot/sources/busybox.config to include &quot;CONFIG_AR=y&quot; (line 39). Then modify buildroot/build_mipsel/root/bin/ipkg to use &quot;ar&quot; for extracting ipkg files (line 729, change &quot;tar&quot; into &quot;ar -p&quot;, just like 2 lines below it). Possibly also a symlink has to be made to busybox for ar, so while you&#039;re in buildroot/build_mipsel/root/bin/ anyway, type &quot;ln -s busybox ar&quot;. Rebuild your openwrt image, and it *should* support standard iPKG packages now...well, except for the ones which were already created for openwrt :-)</p><p>Chicken, egg, time to make a decision on whether or not to support standard iPKGs?</p><p>That&#039;s all for now, more to follow as I progress. Happy packaging.</p>									</div>

					<p>Replying to my own post, as seen in this post<br /><a href="http://openwrt.ksilebo.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=108">http://openwrt.ksilebo.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=108</a><br />it is indeed possible to utilize ipkg-buildpackage to create an iPKG package. I&#039;ve been looking into this too, yesterday, and I&#039;m in the process of building a standard ipkg/rules template which developers can use to create packages with. I was thinking to grab the main Makefile from buildroot as base,&nbsp; then add some stuff from a standard make/*.mk file for the details. I&#039;d introduce a macro to point to the openwrt buildroot, so little effort is needed to set up a crosscompile environment to build packages when you already built openwrt at least once :-)<br />Of course this will all be documented, and maybe we can use that to fill in the &quot;how to build packages&quot; in the WiKi.</p><p>The fun part about this: If all this gets standardized, you can potentially crosscompile a lot of small packages straight from the Debian repository to MIPS32 without too much effort. This is because Debian source packages are already prepared to be packaged into a deb. At most things might require small patches to work in a relatively stripped environment like openwrt, but all that can be added as we go along.</p><p>Another thing that needs to be done is define some simple package guidelines. Use /usr/bin, not /usr/local, you get the idea.</p><p>I wrote this down so we can prevent effort being duplicated. I plan on going through with this unless someone steps up and mentions it&#039;s already been done. So please direct questions, comments and suggestions my way through this thread so we can coordinate. There&#039;s no need to have people reinvent the wheel twice and thrice, or duplicate effort in porting packages which are already ported by someone else.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah, I was actually going to try and make a simple howto for creating more ipkg&#039;s I just haven&#039;t gotten to it. A nice thing to have for any of the repositories up is to provide to source/patches/rules/etc for how they built the package. This way we can do some Q/A and possibly fix small errors that may occur in packages. My standard was just creating a directory at my top level called src/ which includes all the files I used to create a package.</p><p>Any comments on providing the source for the packages we create?</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve created an ipkg/ directory skeleton for use with ipkg-buildpackage. You can download it from <a href="http://www.linuxops.net/ipkg/utils/ipkg.skel.tar.gz">http://www.linuxops.net/ipkg/utils/ipkg.skel.tar.gz</a><br />To use it, just unpack your package source, cd into its directory, and untar this skeleton as ipkg/<br />Then modify ipkg/control for package information, and ipkg/rules so it can find your openwrt buildroot. You&#039;ll likely need to dig into the build process itself too, and modify some targets like build-stamp and install. Its hard to generalize that stuff. I&#039;ve prepared some example code which you can easily modify to match your packages build process.</p><p>For an example, download e.g. my openswan ipkg/ directory from <a href="http://www.linuxops.net/ipkg/openswan-2.1.2-ipkg.tar.gz">http://www.linuxops.net/ipkg/openswan-2.1.2-ipkg.tar.gz</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Actually, adding &quot;wrt&quot; to the package name isn&#039;t a bad idea because what we&#039;re building are not standard ipkg packages. We&#039;re building with &quot;tar&quot;, which is different from the normally used &quot;ar&quot;. So to make sure people don&#039;t try to use packages for openwrt on some other mipsel device (can&#039;t think of any, but it never hurts to take future developments into account), hardwiring the packages to the platform doesn&#039;t hurt.</p><p>Also adding the version might be a good idea, so for b4 you get e.g.</p><p>openswan-2.1.2wrtb4_mipsel.ipk or somesuch.</p><p>Thoughts?</p>									</div>

					<p>As a learning excercise, I&#039;ve been trying to make an ipkg of IPTABLES-SAVE and IPTABLES-RESTORE.&nbsp; Yes, I&#039;m probably biting off a lot more than I can chew at this point.&nbsp; Anyway, I&#039;ve been going about this by trying to compile ipatables-save.c with this command<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mipsel-linux-uclibc-gcc -Wall -g -o iptables-save iptables-save.c</code></pre></div><p>but I get a pageful of errors.&nbsp; Looking through the Makefile that comes with the iptables 1.2.9 tarball I see that a lot of flags are passed to the compiler - it&#039;s all quite complicated.&nbsp; I suppose I could work my way through the makefile to see exactly what&#039;s going on, but I&#039;d rather just work out how to use this makefile with the mipsel compiler.<br />Is this possible?&nbsp; The compiler is specified with the variable $(CC) but I can&#039;t work out where this variable is defined.&nbsp; Does make just insert a default compiler here?&nbsp; I don&#039;t understand how make knows which compiler to use.</p>									</div>

					<p>Given the complexity of iptables, and the likely dependency of the required tools on libipt.so, I would suggest to not just build the binaries you need, but do a complete compile of the entire iptables source tree. After you do a `make install` (into a temporary location, set $DESTDIR) strip the installation of stuff you *don&#039;t* need, and create a package from what you have left (binaries, and maybe the libipt library). Don&#039;t forget to strip.</p><p>This way you&#039;re using the &quot;intelligence&quot; built into the build process of iptables to get everything in working order, instead of having to reinvent the wheel for getting the required binaries to build.</p>									</div>

If you&#039;re in luck the developers use autotools (autoconf, etc, you know, the &quot;./configure&quot; script) which you simply feed the proper variables and it&#039;ll pick all of it up itself. If not, well, then you get to dig into Makefiles and such. Fun, but not for the faint of heart.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Also, I&#039;ve noticed that in some of the &#039;rules&#039; files for ipkg building there are routines that &#039;strip&#039;.&nbsp; What exactly is this strip process?</p></blockquote></div><p>strip(1) removes stuff from binaries which are not really required for functioning. Like symbols and the likes. It shrinks the binaries in size. Which is a good thing for embedded systems.</p>									</div>
