					<p>Hi,</p><p>i tried to install OpenWRT on TP-Link WR841N V11. I downloaded the openwrt firmware from the openwrt wiki site of tl-wr841nd (i read that it is identifical to Tl-wr841n, so i use the firmware from tl-wr841nd).<br />Every Time when i try to flash it over &quot;Firmware upgrade&quot; i get this: </p><p>Error code: 18005<br />Upgrade unsuccessfully because the version of the upgraded file was incorrect. Please check the file name.</p><p>I tried already to change the file name to &quot;wr841n_v11_160325.bin&quot; or &quot;wr841n_v11_160325.bin&quot; (which are the name of the original firmware&quot;, but there is no effect.</p><p>I hope you understand my problem. What can I do to solve it?</p>									</div>
