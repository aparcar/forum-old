A rule of thumb one can look at:<br /><a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/voice/voice-quality/7934-bwidth-consume.html">http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/do â€¦ nsume.html</a><br />So in the vicinity of 90Kbps bi-directional; To be pleasant VoIP also required a reasonably low jitter, which in a typical hotel network might be the bigger issue than pure bandwidth. As a first approximation I would assume if Skype calls are bearable so should be &quot;road-warrior&quot; VoIP. I wonder how well your box will fare against the unavoidable NAT the hotel will be forcing upon you <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />.</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>

Check out <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/speedtest">www.dslreports.com/speedtest</a> to measure latency under load.</p><p>But if you already own the Magic Jack and the CT-14, then it might be worth the experiment.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m surprisingly happy with my Plantronics M50. Small, relatively inexpensive, decent quality. It also supports multipoint, so you can associate with both your cell phone and your computer. (So you can Skype or use the mobile, but of course, not simultaneously.)</p>									</div>

So your VoIP box needs to pierce the NAT from the inside so that you are reachable. Most VoIP providers, as far as I know, offer that as a service (since home gateways also come with NAT and fire walling, they need to accommodate for that otherwise they loose non-technical customers); but better check that before buying something...</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;M.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you want VoIP suggestions, buy the OBi200 (about $45 on amazon), then configure with Ring.To for free VoIP service (although you are required to add$1/month for E911 service, not that it will help you on the road).&nbsp; Alternatively, you can configure it with Google Voice for a fully free solution.&nbsp; Let me know if you have questions-I&#039;ve done loads of research on this.</p>									</div>

					<p>If your budget allows, the OBi200 as suggested above is not a bad idea. </p><p><strong>A bit off-topic</strong>: if I had such a budget, I would get me some inexpensive small footprint Linux embedded devices supported by OpenWRT, i.e. <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/cloudengines/pogo-v4">PogoPlug Mobile V4</a>, Seagate GoFLEX <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/seagate/goflexhome">Home</a>/<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/seagate/goflexnet">NET</a> (or even a <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/seagate/dockstar">DockStar</a>), etc., and turn it into a server to support a Digital PBX system with any PBX software, i.e. <a href="http://asterisk.org">Asterisk</a>, <a href="http://freeswitch.org">FreeSWITCH</a>, <a href="http://yate.ro">YATE</a>, etc. Then, use any ATA device, i.e. Basic Talk, MagicJack, etc., as the extension to the Digital PBX System. Recently, I bought some <a href="http://www.adorama.com/COCPOGOP02.html">PogoPlug Pro 02</a> from Adorama under US $5 (after a US $10 rebate). This device can run and/or is supported by OpenWRT and/or Debian ARM Linux and can be simply configured as a Digital PBX System, NAS, Media Streamers, etc.</p>									</div>

Also, it looks like the current configuration requires OpenWRT to be flashed onto the internal NAND storage. In other words, OpenWRT will not boot off of any external (SATA or USB) storage without a copy of OpenWRT flashed onto the internal NAND storage. WIth a stock firmware still on the internal NAND storage, OpenWRT will boot the Linux kernel and then loads rootfs from the internal storage. This has something to do with the default settings of OpenWRT&#039;s Linux kernel configuration, AFAICT.</p>									</div>
