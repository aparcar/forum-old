					<p>Hi!</p><p>I just bought a Siemens SE505 v2 Router. The first thing I did was to get the latest OpenWRT firmware. Unfortunately there is not much documenation. The router is considered supported in the wiki. But it just refuses the firmware. I tried uploading via Webinterface and TFTP. The web interface refuses the firmware with the message: invalid firmware. But I don&#039;t wonder about that since the original firmware has an additional header that the trx files lack. I tried to add the header using a hex editor. But still no success with the web interface.</p><p>Flashing via TFTP yielded partial success. The router booted into openwrt but it was damn slow. The webinterface hardly responded. Logging in via telnet worked but was extremely slow too. I couldn&#039;t work with it at all.</p><p>Then I tried a firmware from freifunk.net (it&#039;s based on openwrt and denoted especially for the SE505: <a href="http://212.222.128.68/sven-ola/ipkg/_se505/)">http://212.222.128.68/sven-ola/ipkg/_se505/)</a>. And it worked just fine with both web interface and TFTP. The stability and performance is just fine with this firmware.</p><p>What should I do with the openwrt firmware to get it working with the SE505?</p><p>Thanks in advice!</p><p>Mirko</p>									</div>

					<p>yeah, i got mine for exactly the same price and thought i&#039;ll try it anyway - however, i was disappointed when the connection dropped every 3 hours or so because of no ram (i had to use pptp). having usb-modules loaded at the same time wasn&#039;t even possible for me!</p><p>greetings,<br />andy</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey, I really wonder how to use the openwrt images. The bin images from freifunk (<a href="http://212.222.128.68/sven-ola/ipkg/_se505/">http://212.222.128.68/sven-ola/ipkg/_se505/</a>) that base on openwrt are especially for the siemens se505. They managed to build a bin image. I uploaded it via the webinterface of the original siemens firmware and everthing succeeded. But I can&#039;t do this with the images from the openwrt website since they only provide the raw trx image and bin images for some other routers.</p><p>I recognized a 28-byte-header in the bin image from freifunk. My approach was to use this freifunk header with the raw trx image from openwrt. So i added it to the beginning of the trx image using a hexeditor. But unfortunately this didn&#039;t work <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> Maybe there is some sort of checksum somewhere?</p><p>Any suggestions how to flash a siemens se505 v2 properly?</p><p>PS: Yes, i tried TFTP. That works only with the freifunk firmware like webupload. And btw i&#039;m trying whiterussian rc4 because of the issues with rc5 and the se505.</p>									</div>

					<p>ok. i managed it now. that&#039;s the way i flash a se505 (there might be better ones):</p><p> - first flash freifunk firmware (via tftp or webif)<br /> - login to routerrun &quot;ipkg install mtd&quot;<br /> - from a desktop pc: &quot;cat &lt;xxx.trx&gt; | ssh root@router mtd -r write - linux&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;xxx.trx&gt; has to be the filename of the trx image. the router will reboot after flashing.</p>									</div>
