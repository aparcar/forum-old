					<p>things like having 3-4 different areas to set you DNS...yet the menu option specifically with DNS in its title literally has zero affect on the DNS you use for querries is the biggets falacy</p><p>but also how about the fact that it appears to default to eth0.2 as the actual routing name to setup SQM-QOS but the default in SQM is just eth1 which will have NO affect on your traffic</p><p>also the reboot appears to not be responsive at all, i look at the LAN lights on my router and have seen enough reboots with DDWRT and factory firmware to know a reboot makes all lights steady then go off as the device literally power cycles itself, OWRT never does this</p><p>speaking of reboot, there needs to be a physical GUI ability to factory reset the router, not using telenet terminal codes or physically resetting the router, or installing DDWRT and then back to OWRT as a crude-yet-easier/lazier way to do that as well</p><br /><p>also can we finally get an EASY to USE free text table to allow us to block specific ports or ip ranges and not need the antiquated and unnecessarily over-complicated iptables data?</p><p>my 2006 D-LINK DGL-4100 has no where near the requirements to hold any custom firmware, not even the lightested DDWRT, has zero wifi support, hasnt had a firmware update since early 2007 and yet....has a SIMPLE..EASY TO USE access control menu that allows you to put SIMPLE ip ranges no slashes, just the WAN ip or range from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255 and it blocks them, in any configuration you want</p><p>if i want to block a range of ip&#039;s i can simply WHOIS it and block the range described being leased to either the specific company&#039;s range, or the entire range that the IP is associated to in full and thats it</p><p>no slashes, no complicated table of stringed IP&#039;s and all the different slashes and numbers that can fallow..</p><p>I can plug this router in right now, place it ahead of openwrt and get a literal plug-n-play feature more secure and easy to use than the overly complex WRT variants and I have a hard time believing there&#039;s some PATENT on making a simple free text box to enter IPs in and simply blocking them, hell you can also just FREELY past the MAC or IP for other ranges as well, rather than the ANNOYING individualized boxes for each 2-3 digit between the dots and colons</p><p>you copy your IP or MAC with all the colons or dots and past in the FIRST box and it populates to the other boxes accordingly....this cant be complex coding this is almost a 15yo router firmware by a large well known routing manufacturing company D-LINK</p>									</div>

					<p>Luci interface reflect technical details as they appear in configuration files. It can be not too friendly for users but it precisely reflect what happens on low level. When you understand how things work you understand why web interface looks as it looks. That&#039;s what I personally love because it does not try to simplify anything and give it as it is. Its for professionals, not for newbies. I guess if you try to configure a professional appliance (for example cisco router) you also will be confused because it requires some learning. Home-grade systems have simple and easy to use interface but they also stuck to pre-designed scenario or two and do not allow deep customization because it would make everything too hard for user. Also if someone try to make professional appliance user-friendly it will probably break its initial purpose and make professionals hate it because of its stupidity.<br />I have nothing against alternative simplified web UI for ordinary users but it must be optional and it must not break&nbsp; internal flexibility. But for the moment i&#039;d suggest move to another firmware such as dd-wrt because its closer to your demands.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bolvan</strong> on 20 Oct 2016, 17:58)</p>

Sqm does not care what interface you instantiate it on, putting it onto an internally LAN-facing port is just as valid as putting it onto an externally WAN-facing port, so there literally is no default value that will work for everybody. Add to that the fact that different router models end up using different ethernet interfaces with or without VLANs (the .2 in your eth0.2 example sqm has no easy way of detecting the actual WAN interface. BUT you need to manually configure SQM anyways with meaningful and well researched numbers (for bandwidths and overhead). So if selecting the desired interface seems to burdensome, you might simply want to deinstall sqm-scripts and luci-app-sqm as selecting the correct interface is most likely the easiest part in setting it up. (But since SQM-scripts is not enabled after installation and has no real run-time or memory cost if inactive you can simply leave things as they are...)</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>
