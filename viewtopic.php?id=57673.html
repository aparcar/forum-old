					<p>So by your guys recommendation I bought WDR3600 router (v. 1.5) and flashed OpenWRT. Now what&#039;s bothering me is such a low wifi range. I am using 2.4Ghz and with maximum power (20dBm (100 mW)) and range is only like 7 meters in my room. </p><p>If i go over the corner to another room it completely disappears. I mean my 8 year old WRT54GL would have 3x more range in comparison, and I would expect this new router be much better.</p><p>It&#039;s ok for me cause I live in small room, but I think it would be useless in a bigger apartment, let alone a house, unless I am completelly missing something.</p><p>P.s. For some reason I flashed 12.09, so can i now flash 14.07 from <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wdr3600-v1-squashfs-factory.bin">https://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_b â€¦ actory.bin</a> ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>childintime</strong> on 30 May 2015, 14:30)</p>

					<p>I think you can use sysupgrade to upgrade from 12.09 to 14.07.<br />If I am wrong someone should correct me here within hours <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Going back to OEM and then use factory 14.07 should also work, of course.</p><p>Lets see if the upgrade does anything to the range, before we analyse that further.</p>									</div>

					<p>@childintime, you can upgrade straight to BB through either sysupgrade at the command prompt or flashing it through the LuCI web interface. I&#039;ve done it both ways and have not had issues. Up to you whether you want to select the &quot;keep settings&quot; box if you do it through LuCI.</p>									</div>

					<p>Oh, and I&#039;ll add that I have a WDR3600 as well, running BB, and my 2.4GHz range is perfectly normal in my house. Where I struggle is the 5GHz range... at 5GHz it can barely reach my bedroom just two rooms away whereas 5GHz with the WiFi builtin to my Google Fiber router reaches the bedroom just fine... and the two routers are just a few feet away from each (on very different channels so as to not interfere with each other). Can also depend what specific channel you&#039;re using. But, like zo0ok said, WiFi range and signal can be a very strange beast at times. For the WDR3600, make sure the antennae are tight and try shifting their angles to see if it improves anything.</p><p>I have a WRT54GL as well... the thing just won&#039;t die. :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>Additional tx power doesn&#039;t always help real-world range. Your devices tx power won&#039;t be increased, so your router may not &quot;hear&quot; the devices. In addition, you are amplifying noise. </p><p>Make sure your antennas are attached properly and facing straight up.</p>									</div>
