					<p>Where is the nat policy configured in KAMIKAZE... I need to turn off the hide nat for the internal network and have the abilitiy to create static nat&#039;s and no-nat rules...</p><p>I only know the very basic&#039;s of IP tables but I can not find any statements that look like they define a rule saying<br />Src----Dest-----Service----TranslatedSrc---TransDest---TransService</p><p>I dont see anything in relation to NAT in /etc/config/firewall</p><p>maybe its configured in /etc/firewall.user and I just dont know how to write the rule...... ????? or in /etc/init.d/firewall??????</p><p>I have my netscreen infront of the linksys and the netscreen has a site to site VPN to a friends house but the way I configured my local encryption domain on it will require me to have a static for ip&#039;s I want to push over the VPN</p><br /><p>plus it makes me crazy that its natting everything to the external ip... it makes it a bit hard to create firewall rules when everything has the same IP address</p><p>I found how to disable it in DDWRT in the GUI but now with OpenWRT I cant find where to disable it...</p><p>I was thinking of using Firewall Builder which looks to work just like the Checkpoint GUI... but thats sorta cheating</p>									</div>
