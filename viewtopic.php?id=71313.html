					<p>Hey folks, </p><p>just came back to the OpenWrt community after a couple years of being lazy with my routers. </p><p>Recent hacking attempts made it desirable to get my old routers re-flashed with clean opensource firmware... </p><p>The TP Link is well supported and not a problem, but I can&#039;t effing find the solution for the Zyxel anymore. </p><p>I remember it was sort of a workaround (image from 419N worked or something like that), and I remember seeing a Gargoyle build specifically for the 416N it from some Polish dude, but can&#039;t find any of it any more.&nbsp; (3 years is a long time on the Interwebz... lol). </p><br /><p>Anyone here has this little thing working with current OpenWrt releases and/or would be patient enough to point me into the right direction?</p><p>Much appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>In any case, newer kernels / builds are too big for the device&#039;s 16MB RAM.&nbsp; Consider one of the GL.Inet or a TL-WR741 as a suitable replacement light-duty router that is well supported.</p>									</div>

					<p>DAAAAAAAMN - I knew I should have saved that one working Gargoyle image, even if it was in Polish, lol... </p><p>Because it DID work back then, unsupported or not xD</p><p>Anyways, thanks for the replies, guess I&#039;ll have to find a suitable replacement (difficult in Paraguay, very limited choices re hardware... ) </p><p>cheers</p>									</div>
