					<p>Hello all. I&#039;ve come across some Titan Wireless TW-533-4 (Zinwell ZW-4400) boards which seem to be supported devices. I&#039;ve had success in connecting to the boards and flashing them with Backfire openwrt-tw5334-zImage and openwrt-ixp4xx-generic-squashfs.img; but I&#039;ve noticed a few things; I was wondering if anyone has exprienced this and if maybe I was overlooking something. Any response is appreciated, as I&#039;m working on these for a non-profit cause:</p><p>1.) I don&#039;t seem to be able to access the Compactflash drive in any way<br />2.) The device reads that it has a total of 16MB RAM; but the hardware has 64MB RAM<br />3.) Sometimes during faster speed LAN-to-WAN connections, there are connectivity issues and the following output is displayed in the console until the connection begins working again</p><p>Backtrace: <br />Function entered at [&lt;c00253b4&gt;] from [&lt;c01fce58&gt;]<br /> r7:00000000 r6:c02616c4 r5:00000021 r4:00000000<br />Function entered at [&lt;c01fce40&gt;] from [&lt;c0067678&gt;]<br />Function entered at [&lt;c0067140&gt;] from [&lt;c0086f28&gt;]<br />Function entered at [&lt;c0086c6c&gt;] from [&lt;c00872a0&gt;]<br />Function entered at [&lt;c0087208&gt;] from [&lt;c0176f30&gt;]<br /> r7:c0809a40 r6:00003820 r5:00000020 r4:c035c7a0<br />Function entered at [&lt;c0176ee0&gt;] from [&lt;c0177748&gt;]<br /> r9:00000680 r8:c0968000 r7:c035c860 r6:ffc01680 r5:00000034<br />r4:c0968000<br />Function entered at [&lt;c0177724&gt;] from [&lt;c015fbac&gt;]<br /> r5:00000034 r4:c06dde00<br />Function entered at [&lt;c015faa8&gt;] from [&lt;c017f8b0&gt;]<br />Function entered at [&lt;c017f848&gt;] from [&lt;c0038574&gt;]<br />Function entered at [&lt;c00384f4&gt;] from [&lt;c0038648&gt;]<br />Function entered at [&lt;c0038600&gt;] from [&lt;c0021074&gt;]<br />Function entered at [&lt;c0021000&gt;] from [&lt;c0021a70&gt;]<br />Exception stack(0xc0249f48 to 0xc0249f90)<br />9f40:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;c024ad68 c024ad68 c0249f90 60000013 c0248000 c02619a4<br />9f60: c024ba18 c024ba10 0001d87c 690541c2 0001d3d0 c0249f9c c0249fa0 c0249f90<br />9f80: c0022e54 c00228b0 60000013 ffffffff<br /> r7:c024ba10 r6:00000008 r5:0000001f r4:ffffffff<br />Function entered at [&lt;c0022888&gt;] from [&lt;c0022e54&gt;]<br />Function entered at [&lt;c0022df4&gt;] from [&lt;c01f835c&gt;]<br /> r7:c024ba10 r6:c001fe10 r5:c026196c r4:c02693e4<br />Function entered at [&lt;c01f8300&gt;] from [&lt;c00089d4&gt;]<br />Function entered at [&lt;c0008764&gt;] from [&lt;00008034&gt;]<br />Mem-info:<br />DMA per-cpu:<br />CPU&nbsp; &nbsp; 0: hi:&nbsp; &nbsp; 0, btch:&nbsp; &nbsp;1 usd:&nbsp; &nbsp;0<br />active_anon:22 inactive_anon:175 isolated_anon:0<br /> active_file:592 inactive_file:369 isolated_file:0<br /> unevictable:0 dirty:0 writeback:0 unstable:0<br /> free:285 slab_reclaimable:171 slab_unreclaimable:1360<br /> mapped:165 shmem:30 pagetables:33 bounce:0<br />DMA free:1140kB min:508kB low:632kB high:760kB active_anon:88kB inactive_anon:700kB active_file:2368kB inactive_file:1476kB unevictable:0kB isolated(anon):0kB isolated(fo<br />lowmem_reserve[]: 0 0 0<br />DMA: 149*4kB 62*8kB 1*16kB 1*32kB 0*64kB 0*128kB 0*256kB 0*512kB 0*1024kB 0*2048kB 0*4096kB = 1140kB<br />991 total pagecache pages<br />0 pages in swap cache<br />Swap cache stats: add 0, delete 0, find 0/0<br />Free swap&nbsp; = 0kB<br />Total swap = 0kB<br />4096 pages of RAM<br />342 free pages<br />644 reserved pages<br />1531 slab pages<br />911 pages shared<br />0 pages swap cached<br />swapper: page allocation failure. order:2, mode:0x21</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve been researching and noticed that this is an issue in OpenWRT with some boards.<br />Users note that high speed connections cause some boards to crash with certain builds. I haven&#039;t been able to locate a posting with anyone who had a copy of the console output when it occurs, so I hope that this can help someone or provide more insight.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lleachii</strong> on 30 Apr 2014, 17:59)</p>
