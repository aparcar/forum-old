					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;m quite lost of how to do this, any help would be great <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I have 2 wrt54gs&#039; and would like to create one large wifi network with out having to connect to the network closest, but to have you seamlessly move between the networks with out user intervention. I&#039;ve noticed this in hotels when I have spotted wifi boxes around the place but only being able to see one solid network.</p><p>All I have managed to find out so far is that if this is done by linking the 2 boxes by wifi you half the speed, but I have a bunch of cable so can link then by cable rather than wifi.</p><p>How can I do this and how can I manage the config over the 2 boxes? wep key etc</p><p>Solexious</p>									</div>

					<p>I could be wrong, but I don&#039;t think you can do what you want through the WRT54G boxes.<br />I think you have to manage your laptop&#039;s wireless card, instead.&nbsp; Check with your distro&#039;s repos to see if there&#039;s an app that manages your wireless connections automatically (&quot;roaming&quot;) so that they pick-up and associate with the different access points as you physically move between them.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Shagbag</strong> on 17 Mar 2008, 18:57)</p>
