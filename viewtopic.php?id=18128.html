					<p>Has anyone managed to get one of these printers working on Kami 7.09?<br />It requires the foo2zjs printer driver which needs compiling as there is no publicly available binary for Kami.<br />I have followed the wiki on printer serving but I stop when I get to invoking &#039;make&#039;.&nbsp; I get the error: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>-ash: make: not found</code></pre></div><p>I was advised to checkout building it using the OpenWRT SDK.&nbsp; I&#039;ve looked into that but, as I have no programming skills, it looks a bit difficult porting the foo2zjs Makefile so that it can be cross-compiled using the SDK.<br />Has anyone done this?&nbsp; If so, would they be kind enough to share their foo2zjs package with me?</p><p>Kind regards</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve solved it.<br />I didn&#039;t read the HOWTO properly.&nbsp; It said &quot;install foo2zjs drivers...&nbsp; <em>on linux box</em>&quot;.<br />I didn&#039;t need to install them on my wl-500g premium v1, after all.<br />All I had to do was get a copy of the printer&#039;s &quot;sihp1018.dl&quot; firmware file on to the wl-500g and cat it to /dev/usb/lp0.<br />I can now print from my Ubuntu netbook on to the HP1018 attached to my wl-500g.</p>									</div>
