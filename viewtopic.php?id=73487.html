					<p>I own an Ubiquiti Airrouter running OpenWRT that I&#039;m using to connect several cabled devices to my wireless network. This works fine as long as I&#039;m using static IP&#039;s but even after spending several hours on this, I cannot get DHCP addresses coming in from my main router to be relayed. </p><p>My setup: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>&lt;client&gt; ---[cable]--- &lt;owrt bridge&gt; --[wifi]-- &lt;my_router&gt; ------ &lt;Internet&gt;</code></pre></div><p>Setting up, I followed the instructions exactly as found on the wiki. I also went and checked if there are any updated versions out there but all information I could find more or less confirms what&#039;s in the wiki. The only thing I did in the end on top of what&#039;s written in the wiki is to give my wwan a static IP and to entirely stop and disable dnsmasq, the firewall, and dhcp. </p><p>I ran tcpdump on the client and on the owrt bridge. The DHCP request from the client clearly gets to my_router and my_router sends a valid dhcp reply to the broadcast adress (255.255.255.255). In the tcpdump on owrt bridge, I can verify that the owrt bridge actually receives this reply. </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/etc# tcpdump -i any port 68

					<p>I did some further research on the topic. By just adding another entry to the routing table (add -net 192.168.0.0 if br-lan) I can now reach all devices connected directly to the OpenWRT router. </p><p>Still, I&#039;m no further on DHCP messages being relayed. As I mentioned in my original post, the DHCP server receives the request and sends a reply back to the mac address of the wlan0 interface on the OpenWRT router, including the mac address of the final recipient computer. But this reply never makes it out of the OpenWRT router. Is there a possibility that my DHCP server is the issue? </p><p>Anyway, still hoping someone more experienced can give me a hint what to try next.</p>									</div>

					<p>Here is a working configuration, derived from that wiki article I linked. I&#039;m typing this reply on a computer connected by cable to OpenWRT, which is connected via WiFi to my usual LAN. My computer has an IP address via DHCP from the subnet allocated to my LAN, so I know it works.</p><p>For this test I made one single change from the wiki article (or, rather, I didn&#039;t change anything at all). I left the OpenWRT box&#039;s IP address as 192.168.1.1, because my usual LAN is on a different subnet. I didn&#039;t have to change it to 192.168.2.1, because there was no conflict between subnets.</p><p>Feel free to compare this configuration against yours to determine what you might need to change.</p><p>For reference, this test was carried out on a GL-iNet MT-G300N (v1), running LEDE 17.01.4, with all included opkg packages updated. The only additional packages I installed were <strong>relayd</strong> and <strong>luci-proto-relay</strong>.</p><br /><p><strong>/etc/config/wireless</strong><br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-device &#039;radio0&#039;

The article says to use the subnet 192.168.2.0/24 with the bridge at 192.168.2.1 - if that conflicts with your main LAN, then pick a different address/subnet for the bridge. Apart from that one potential change, leave the rest of the configuration as described in that article.</p><p>Once you&#039;ve got it working, then you can look at refinements such as accessing the OpenWRT bridge via an IP address accessible from your LAN.</p><p>As for the contents of the configuration files, the interface-specific entries such as subinterfaces are an artefact of the build for the chipset in the GL-MT300N. Don&#039;t worry about the interface names, they&#039;re a red herring.</p><p>&quot;Delegate&quot; is an IPv6 option, and may be safely ignored.</p>									</div>
