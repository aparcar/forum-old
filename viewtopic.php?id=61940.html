					<p>Hi all,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;just bought myself a Linksys WRT1900ACS router, hated the software it came with and installed OpenWRT instead.</p><p>I have been searching everywhere for a guide to setting up OpenVPN using the Luci Web Interface, but I am unable to find one.</p><p>There appears to be default configurations included with the installation, but I do not know what I am doing with regards to configuration.</p><p>Does anyone know of a good guide please for configuring OpenVPN via Luci please?</p><p>If I have to I can dig into the command line as I am reasonably ok with Linux. However, when I do try generating new Certs and starting from scratch I get and error, which I do not understand?</p><p>&quot;Please source the vars script first (i.e. &quot;source ./vars&quot;) Make sure you have edited it to reflect your configuration.&quot;</p><p>So I was looking to maybe use the sample configs provided with 15.05 via the Luci interface?</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenVPn is not easy, but start with this as a guide. <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/openvpn-streamlined-server-setup">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/open … rver-setup</a><br />You can find other VPN guides by entering Openvpn in the upper right search box.</p><p>I do not suggest trying to configure with LuCi, but get and install WINScp.&nbsp; Its a file manager for your router.&nbsp; You login like you would with putty, your IP address, user = root, and your password, file protocol SCP and port 22.&nbsp; You will find the files you need in the folders \etc\config and your keys go in \etc\openVPN.</p><p>I am assuming you want to connect to an OpenVPN service as a client, but you have not stated your use case.&nbsp; Many services will have a script for you to use.&nbsp; Backup or rename the delivered openVPN files (NOTE: there is NO opvn extension on the files) and create a new blank openvpn file for you to edit.&nbsp; WinSCP has a text editor built in.&nbsp; Use it to open the delivered file and your new blank one and cut and paste, and\or reformat your services file to the correct format.</p><p>Don&#039;t forget to create the key files (your service will give them to you) and put them in the etc\openvpn folder.&nbsp; There is more than that, but this should keep you busy for a while (interface and firewall config).</p>									</div>

					<p>Much more complicated.&nbsp; Still a good, maybe the best article.<br />You do NOT need to use OpenWRT to generate your keys.&nbsp; I suggest doing if from a local PC and use the OpenVPN tools. all gui driven.&nbsp; Also suggest you do not use your email or real name in the key creation.&nbsp; Just will make your life easy when you post for help, no other real reason.</p><p>Read this page <a href="https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/howto.html">https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-sour … howto.html</a><br />Decide on TUN or TAP.&nbsp; I choose TAP as it&#039;s easier to get the local resources, but I think you can use TUN with the right firewall rules.&nbsp; Leave out any cipher, encryption, mtu etc until you get the 2 sides talking, then tweak 1 feature at a time.</p><p>It honestly took me months to get this working reliably.</p>									</div>
