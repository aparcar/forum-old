					<p>I&#039;m running 8.09 RC1 on a WRT54GL (or a v4 WRT54G, can&#039;t remember which one I have where... same hardware anyway) with vnstat on it, and I want to be able to maintain a persistent database of bandwidth usage.&nbsp; It currently stores the vnstat database in /var/lib/vnstat, which is on the ram.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure moving the file to a position in flash is a good idea: with updates every 5 minutes, I&#039;d be somewhat concerned about flash wear.</p><p>One thing I&#039;m considering is a cron job on my desktop to pull the file down via scp and store it locally.&nbsp; It seems the vnstat init script has the capability to download the file from a webserver, so I could probably just put it somewhere accessible by apache.&nbsp; When it comes back up, the data would be restored.</p><p>Can anyone think of a simpler way to address this problem?</p>									</div>
