Of course, when it comes to UBS and Wired ports there is more work to do before we have 100% consistency. But that is when looking at the filters, and many devices are under unsupported/unknown/possible, and how much effort should we put into finding USB and Ethernet specifications for those?</p><p>When it comes to platform and wireless hardware there is probably also work that can be done. But it seems of quite limited value to the end users to improve those columns even more.</p><p>Also, the ToH will always be work in progress, so even if we make it perfect now, it will change in the future. 100% consistency is not necessarily worth it here.</p><p>I think we should start looking more into:<br/>o status<br/>&nbsp; - is there an image?<br/>&nbsp; - is it working?<br/>o target <br/>&nbsp; - where is the image?<br/>o detail page<br/>&nbsp; - does it exist<br/>&nbsp; - does it contain information whether the device works as indicated in &quot;status&quot;<br/>&nbsp; - is there an image link</p><p>I am particularly unhappy with:<br/> 1) the ramips situation (where I contributed to extra mess, but where it looks very nice with 6 subtargets in CC)<br/> 2) brcm47xx (and the brcm-2.4 confusion, which I think should only be in the device pages, not in the ToH)<br/> 3) routers supported by &quot;generic&quot; image but this information is nowhere to be found</p><p>But (at least I) volunteer to do this job, and if it makes you happy to work more with the USB column I will not stop you <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink"/></p><p>Well, I did update too.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zo0ok</strong> on 26 May 2015, 00:44)</p>

					<p>I have spent a week or so mulling over this note, deciding whether to throw a rock into the pond or not. I am going to throw it. </p><p>(@zo0ok and @tmo26 and @all: Please note that I respect all the work that has gone to getting us where we are, and that I think there&#039;s a way to leverage it to make things even better.)</p><p>But I think we&#039;re missing an opportunity. As I read the tmo26&#039;s response at <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=276557#p276557,">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 7#p276557,</a> I realized that I have had the wrong mental model about how things work today. If I understand correctly, this is the procedure for adding a new device to the ToH:</p><p>1) Create a new page that only holds the dataentry <br/>2) Create a new detail page from the template at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/meta/template_device.">http://wiki.openwrt.org/meta/template_device.</a> Fill it in with the information about your router: tech specs, installation and debricking procedure, pictures, etc. Use datatable&#039;s to get specs from the dataentry for the router<br/>3) Create a new row in the ToH page, and fill in the columns for their new router. Make the first column of the ToH link to the new detail page. Manually fill in all the other columns with info about the router. </p><p>This seems confusing/problematic in several ways:</p><p>- The dataentry page (#1 above) exists solely to hold the dataentry. It serves no other purpose.<br/>- The dataentry page is separated from the details page, so they may not stay in sync, and they&#039;ll certainly be hard to keep track of.<br/>- We haven&#039;t stated (at least, I haven&#039;t seen) any rules for where (in the file system/wiki) it should be located. Even with guidance, they&#039;ll wind up all over the place. It&#039;s bad enough that people can put the details page anywhere they want, but a separate dataentry page will compound the problem.<br/>- Information in the ToH needs to be manually entered - duplicated from the info in the dataentry. This violates the DRY (Don&#039;t Repeat Yourself) principle - since they will inevitably get out of sync.<br/>- zo0ok runs a manual process that produces the very cool variant of the ToH, but it isn&#039;t available to people using the site.</p><p>I see an alternate way to do this. I realize what I am proposing isn&#039;t how things work today, but please hear me out. I have two observations/desires:</p><p>1) I really would like the dataentry to be part of the details page. This keeps the router&#039;s details together with the dataentry, so they can be edited in a single operation. And the dataentry formatting on the detail page is both functional and beautiful (see, for example, <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-505">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-505</a> )</p><p>2) It would be great to build the ToH page from the information contained in each dataentry. This means no manual duplication/errors, and I think it would be simpler for people to update/add to the ToH. It would be especially cool if we could add a some CSS/formatting to zo0ok&#039;s automatically generated page to make it the default ToH.</p><p>Is this possible? Am I way off track here? Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>richbhanover</strong> on 26 May 2015, 23:56)</p>

					<p>Update complete: <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9061436/openwrt/toh/latest/index.html">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/906 … index.html</a></p><p>@richbhanover and @tmp, I summarize as I understand it. If we are lucky, you both agree with my understanding, and we are all in sync. Otherwise it does not hurt to discuss this more.</p><p>The soon to be &quot;Table of Hardware&quot; and &quot;Device Pages&quot;:<br/>- The ToH as we no it will go away<br/>- Each row in the Table of Hardware will have its own Data Entry Page<br/>&nbsp; (with the same, but also more, information than todays ToH)<br/>- The future ToH will be dynamic and entirely based on the Data Entries<br/>- The Device pages... well at least they will not contain the information that is already in the Data Entry because they can &quot;import&quot; values from (one or more) Data Entry and display it.</p><p>So I think we have two important tracks to proceed on:<br/> 1) status/image/target-work (and probably it depends on that we get started with Data Entries, since that is where the image link goes)<br/> 2) for some (complicated) devices, work with the DataEntry-DynamicTableOfHardware-DevicePage model so that we dont migrate data and then regret the model.</p><p>Have I got it quite right?<br/>@richbhanover: does it make sense? (btw, I like throwing stones in ponds too)</p><p>Edit: one more little reality check here...<br/>I, @zo0ok, can write scripts to help automate the generation of the Data Entries<br/>It is @tmo who understands that the above will work as described and intended in the wiki. I dont know that, and I am not a wiki expert.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zo0ok</strong> on 27 May 2015, 10:15)</p>
