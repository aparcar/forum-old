					<p>Just to make sure we understand the topology --- Router #2 is connected to Router #1 via one of the 4 switch interfaces, and NOT the outside (WAN) interface? </p><p>If this is the case then Router #2 is just being used as a switch and has no routing functionality. It&#039;s also likely there is a DHCP conflict, unless Router #2&#039;s DHCP has been shut off. </p><p>Maybe I&#039;m just misunderstanding the topology, or if you want it set up this way then Router #2&#039;s DHCP/DNS services may need to be shut off.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davidc502</strong> on 15 Nov 2016, 05:20)</p>

					<p>Yes, router #2 is connected via a LAN interface to a router #1 LAN. Router #2&#039;s DHCP is turned off.</p>									</div>

					<p>Router #2 in this configuration is a switch (Without additional configuration). So, in essence, there&#039;s no reason for router #2 (at least the management Interface), to be able to ping or resolve any hostnames. Other than VLAN management, and maybe a few other layer 2 things.&nbsp; </p><p>However, OpenWrt/LEDE is very flexible, so it wouldn&#039;t surprise me if you couldn&#039;t do some routing out of those switch interfaces, but it would all have to be configured ahead of time, and really wouldn&#039;t make much sense considering there&#039;s the WAN interface already set up and ready to go. </p><p>Bottom line... If the hosts on the network are happy, and are getting out / working properly... Don&#039;t worry about what&#039;s happening on #2 unless you want to configure some VLANS.</p>									</div>

					<p>I see router#2 is configured as &quot;static&quot;, so it is not getting any DNS configuration from router#1, and you are not configuring it yourself, either; so, how can router#2 know which DNS to use? You need to add a &quot;dns&quot; option to that configuration.</p>									</div>
