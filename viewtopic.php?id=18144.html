					<p>Hi,</p><p>Here&#039;s my situation: I&#039;ve recently added a WGA600N Linksys Dual-Band Wireless-N &quot;Gaming&quot; Adapter to my network (network A). I&#039;m using the WGA600N as a wireless bridge to my WRT54GS v2 w/ Kamikaze to connect a desktop without wireless that&#039;s too unfortunately placed for Ethernet. This mostly works but sometimes the connection just dies. Restarting the WGA600N solves the problem for a little while. I get a good connection anywhere from a few minutes to 2 days. But inevitably it doesn&#039;t last.<br />I started thinking maybe the WGA600N was bad. So I used the WGA600N on another network, call it network B, with a different router and stock Linksys firmware. The connection lasted about 3 days the first time it was configured. This is typical of network B as the AP is really too far away.</p><p>I also have two other laptops on this wireless network A that don&#039;t seem to have a problem staying connected.</p><p>Now I&#039;m thinking I can try adjusting the tx power on the router, maybe lowering it from it&#039;s default. I tried lowering the power on the WGA600N from &quot;high&quot; to &quot;medium&quot;. That did seem to help a bit.</p><p>Anyone have experience with these wireless bridges and Kamikaze on a WRT54GS? Or any otherwise useful help?<br />Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gliss</strong> on 19 Dec 2008, 21:03)</p>
