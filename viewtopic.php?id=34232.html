					<p>Hello,<br />So, I was trying to install openwrt on my Rev D router. I started with upgrading redboot using pyjungo following the instructions on <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/actiontec/mi424wr">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/actiontec/mi424wr</a>. I then followed the instructions on <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=30545">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=30545</a>. All seemed to go well.</p><p>However on the reboot I couldn&#039;t connect to the router on the lan ports. I tried the snapshot and latest backfire release to no avail. I thought that I&#039;d try to restore the image I&#039;d backed up and see if I could telnet in to verify the mac addresses. I followed the instructions on the wiki page to reload the backup image from redboot. It seemed to go Ok. However when I rebooted the router I end up with a red power led. If I power up with the reset button held in I end up with an orange power led.</p><p>I saw some postings implying it was in the redboot stage with the orange led. With a static ip I can ping 192.168.1.1 on the lan but not on the wan. I tried telnetting to different ports including 80 and 443 in both the red and orange state but with no luck. Is there a different port I should try? </p><p>What thoughts are there on my next step? Firstly I&#039;d like to get a router that I can interact with, then I&#039;d like to get openwrt on it.</p><p>Help <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Well I didn&#039;t brick it then - but maybe I have now ...</p><p>After searching various things on the net I found from the dslreports.net forum that with the orange power on led that it was running a tftp server. I was able to put an Actiontec firmware back on the router.</p><p>Hopefully this helps someone else.</p><p>However, I think in my tired state I hosed it again. First of all I thought I was enabling telnet. However I enabled it on the WAN and took me a while to realize that I hadn&#039;t enabled it on the lan ports. Doh.</p><p>After doing that I went back to the jungo-image and meant to put the revised red-boot. However, I foolishly installed the ram-image. Now I don&#039;t seem to have any boot loader.</p><p>I get no power LED, I&nbsp; get green LED for the wireless, wan and lan port. But I have no dhcp, no 192.168.1.1. I&#039;ve tried the 30/30/30 but that makes no difference.</p><p>Before I found the tip about the tftp server, I was looking at installing a serial connection. Maybe I still need to try that. Maybe I&#039;ve just really f&#039;ed it up now.</p><p>Why are some things so difficult!!!</p>									</div>
