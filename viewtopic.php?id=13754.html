					<p>strace indicated that smbd was aborting after trying to read /etc/TZ which does not exist by default.&nbsp; It is used to set the time zone.&nbsp; There is a wiki entry about setting the time zone, but the contents of my /etc/TZ are:</p><p>CST6CDT,M3.2.0,M11.1.0</p><br /><p>Unfortunately, nmbd gets about that far, reads the TZ file, and then exits for unknown reasons.</p>									</div>
