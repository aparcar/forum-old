					<p>Does anybody know if its possible to configure an ar7 based router to act as a wireless client or bridge to a computer or other internet requiring device?&nbsp; If you have or have setup something similar could you post your configs?&nbsp; I&#039;ve searched through the forums and the wiki but keep finding older openwrt stuff that uses the older style of nvram settings and I&#039;m getting lost trying to translate it over to the way openwrt stores its configuration now.

					<p>the AR7 router works fine with its build in DSL but does not work well with its wifi part (with few function and poor performance.)<br />So if you really want the wifi function, use the original driver.</p>									</div>
