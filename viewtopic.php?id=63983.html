					<p>Hi everybody</p><p>I encountered a rather weird behaviour of the busybox-ntpd when I tried to setup a a ntp server for my local network. The result is, it&#039;s not synchronising. </p><p>I have two Nanostations M5 with the current code from the Chaos Calmer branch. (I compile the imagebuilder and build the images from that.) On those two devices batman advanced is running, it&#039;s for a mesh setup. What I want to achieve is that the gateway acts as a ntp server so that all the nodes in the mesh will have the same time. It&#039;s not that important that they are synchronised to the real time. </p><p>I&#039;m testing this with two devices. The gateway has the option for the server set and the other device has the gateways IP as the first ntp server in the list. At first I was surprised that it didn&#039;t work and sniffed with tcpdump. It appears that first, the server has a huge delay in sending the reply, 45-300 seconds and second, it sends it to the wrong port. It&#039;s never the port it was send from the client.</p><p>Did anyone else experience this or know what might cause it? </p><p>Thanks for the help!</p><p>Kind regards<br />Kacha</p>									</div>
