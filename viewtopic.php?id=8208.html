					<p>Hi!</p><p>I have a bricked WRT54GL v1.1 with samsung chip , and power led flashing. I have a JTAG cable and HairyDairyMaid debrick utility v48. I erased the whole flash, crate a cfe with skynet repair Kit, flashed the cfe but are the LAN leds are on... The cfe doesnt create the nvram. I download a cfe from <a href="http://lonewolf.hacker-nin.com/wrt/cfe/">http://lonewolf.hacker-nin.com/wrt/cfe/</a> but still the same. i have an NVRAM.bin from another wrt54gl 1.1 when i upload it, the power led blinks, and i cant ping the router. </p><p>PLS someone help me. Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>If in the NVRAM.bin (check with an hex editor) the variable boot_wait is not set to on, then you have a problem for the moment.<br />TFTP is not working after power on, because the CFE is not waiting for a contact via TFTP.<br />If the boot_wait is set on by default in the CFE then it works. But with Linksys CFE&#039;s this is not the default case !</p><p>Solutions:</p><p>- patch the NVRAM.bin with a hex-editor by searching for boot_wait, replace off by &quot;on&quot; + 0x0 . And now it becomes tricky.<br />&nbsp; You must move the rest of the valid configuration up by one byte. Reason: &#039;on&#039; has only 2 bytes instead of 3.<br />&nbsp; The entries are separated by one 0 = 0x0 . So the block after it must be moved up by one byte.</p><p>&nbsp; Then flash the NVRAM and TFTP your firmware directly after power on. Described a 1000 times.</p><p>&nbsp; This is risky because of the possible errors.</p><p>- Look for the tricks with the short cutting of some pins of the flash with screw driver. I don&#039;t like this solution to be frank.</p><p>- Make a serial cable as described everywhere. I have done it with a Maxim 232. There are a lot of example circuits in the<br />&nbsp; net. Or buy a solution somewhere. You have to solder, definitely !</p><p>&nbsp; Then use a terminal software to connect with the CFE during startup. press Ctrl-C and you get a prompt.<br />&nbsp; If you don&#039;t get here, the CFE is not working at all !<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; type<br />&nbsp; &gt;nvram set boot_wait=on<br />&nbsp; &gt;nvram commit<br />&nbsp; &gt;nvram get boot_wait&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;only for control if everything is ok</p><p>&nbsp; for syntax help<br />&nbsp; &gt; help<br />&nbsp; or<br />&nbsp; &gt; help nvram</p><p>&nbsp; Then power off/on, TFTP Firmware etc.<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; Be aware of the MAC adress problem as described for CFE.</p><p>Use for TFTP always 192.168.1.1 as the target adress. </p><p>Sorry if there is redundant information, but I don&#039;t know what to assume.</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>									</div>

					<p>Had same issue but I solved it after extensive try-outs on my own. Found a way to fix this by using this link --&gt; <a href="http://www.linksysinfo.org/forums/showthread.php?t=47259">http://www.linksysinfo.org/forums/showt … hp?t=47259</a> . You need to short pin 15 &amp; 16 then do according to the guide. I also needed to redo the CFE flash after i used the tftp cmd. Unfortunately I lost the link to that CFE site, I can post a link to people having problems with this to my CFE file. The MAC adress aint crucial to my notice since the CFE flash made it back to orginal state. I also tried to use Linksys own upgrade tool by the name Auto Upgrade Utility.exe, using that there is no need for the tftp cmd. If anyone has any questions about anything do not hesitate to post here and/or contact me via email.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>aknot</strong> on 10 Jan 2007, 10:14)</p>

					<p>Agreed upon BUT what else todo when its bricked? All due to poor specs on Linksys site you have no or very little chance to know what your buying, for me all i knew was that the v1.1 box had the specs I found on this openWRT site, but that is´nt correct on newer versions of the v1.1....</p>									</div>
