					<p>Hello everyone<br />I&#039;m having trouble setting up routing between 2 different subnets.

					<p>The overarching question is &#039;why is the OpenWrt router in infrastructure mode (separate subnet)?&#039;</p><p>If the requirement is to ringfence (isolate) the associated STAs then the network topology is correct.&nbsp; Should that be untrue, i.e., every STA requires access to all others, configure the OpenWrt router as a (client) bridge (single subnet).</p>									</div>
