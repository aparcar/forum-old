					<p>Hello Everyone,</p><p>I would like to ask for your assistance and advise if I may please.</p><p>I have the above router running RC1 of &#039;Attitude Adjustment 12.09 Beta 2 (stable image)&#039;.</p><p>I have 4 devices on the 4 lan ports and I would like to connect 1 of them to a VPN.</p><p>I have started reading about VPN&#039;s and looked at the Howto&#039;s which seem to be about setting a server up, which I don&#039;t want to do, I&#039;m just connecting to a VPN that is already up and working, but only one one device.</p><p>So the first step was to install OpenVPN on my router I guess, but when I tried I cold not find &#039;luci-app-openvpn&#039; only OpenVPN, which I installed, but with the LUCI bits I&#039;m guessing I don&#039;t see anything in the GUI anyway.</p><p>So I&#039;m pretty stuck, can anyone please offer basic level advice? I&#039;m a GUI kind of person if you&#039;d not guessed yet. ;-)</p>									</div>
