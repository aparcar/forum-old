					<p>right, talk about jumping in at the deep end.... what you are trying to do is no trivial matter.<br />and really, i would invest my time in trying to get a VPN w/ TAP to work rather than manually sorting this out (especially since you are new to &#039;networking and linux&#039;)</p><p>that being said, I do NOT have solution for you, but this might point you in the right direction...<br />the problem starts with SSDP, which uses a broadcast (239.255.255.250 for ip4) which isn&#039;t/shouldn&#039;t be routed so your &#039;magic&#039; only gets you so far. <br />you could map this to a mac to an ip which is routable which is remapped to a broadcast whose response are remapped ... really do try to get TAP to work for you.</p><p>but if you do solve it, i&#039;m very curious for your solution - please post back here when you do.</p>									</div>
