I&#039;ve still working on it. I&#039;ve been battling with tftp protocol for the last few days and the built-in CFE save/flash/readflash/writeflash commands.

					<p>Update: success <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I successfully got a modified rootfs booting:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># uname -a
Linux skywirelessbooster 2.6.22 #1 Fri Oct 25 21:46:20 EEST 2013 mips GNU/Linux
# fwversion
Responses:
sysmgr-0:fwversion 1.0.0.31
# ls -l /etc/test
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 8 Jan 22 2014 /etc/test
# cat /etc/test
Success</code></pre></div><p>This worked with dualimage=disabled set in nvram, a modified rootfs image and stock sky kernel/boot.</p><p>Worth noting that the &#039;rootfs&#039; partition (accessed via load/save/readflash/writeflash commands) actually contains the boot, kernel and rootfs. So if you want to create a custom one, you will need to generate a squashfs image for the rootfs and concatenate it onto the end of the boot and kernel images.</p><p>I was stuck for a while with mksquashfs, it was rejecting any squashfs images I created. Eventually it worked using&nbsp; &#039;squashfs-3.2-r2-wnr1000&#039; version from <a href="https://code.google.com/p/firmware-mod-kit/">firmware-mod-kit</a></p><p>To write a new rootfs partition from CFE, you&#039;ll need to get tftpd working on a laptop/PC then:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>load -tftp -raw -addr=0x80200000 192.168.2.103:newrootfs.bin -max=3599922
writeflash rootfs 0x36ee32</code></pre></div><p>This copies the newrootfs.bin file from 192.168.2.103 (via tftp) to memory address 0x80200000. Then, the writeflash command copies the contents of the memory at 0x80200000 to the rootfs partition (at 0xDA580).</p><p>You might want to backup the contents of the partitions first:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>readflash rootfs 0x003CFFFF
save 192.168.2.103:rootfs_backup.bin 0x80200000 0x003CFFFF</code></pre></div><p>This does the opposite, copies the contents of the rootfs partition into memory (at 0x80200000), then transfers that over tftp to rootfs_backup.bin at 192.168.2.103.</p><p>Sidenote, I was also able to get the original Air4400 firmware booting this way.</p><p>Next up, building an OpenWRT image.</p>									</div>

					<p>Just as an aside, as I was trying to get the booster working as an Access Point I have discovered that the hidden page /lan/operation_mode.html has within the code two options, the first as a booster and the second as an AP. Unfortunately the page does not load correctly throwing up errors and the Submit / Cancel buttons are commented out in code. I&#039;m sure there will be an easy way to submit a correct response to the booster to get it to switch modes...</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey itsbebbo and tactmaster, good to see some more Wireless Booster owners in here <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Regarding the Router Mode, I get the same as you guys, no luck there yet. When using the original 4400 rootfs, the /lan/operation_mode.html page appears to send the right POST api call, but I also get no change on reboot.</p><p>I&#039;ve also tried manually saving/writing over the config partition with the changed value:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>    &lt;product&gt;
        &lt;product-0&gt;
            &lt;log&gt;
                &lt;level&gt;crit&lt;/level&gt;
            &lt;/log&gt;
            &lt;settings&gt;
                &lt;router_mode&gt;router&lt;/router_mode&gt;
                &lt;mac&gt;00:00:00:00:00:00&lt;/mac&gt;
            &lt;/settings&gt;
        &lt;/product-0&gt;
    &lt;/product&gt;</code></pre></div><p>But this still appears to boot into Access Point mode. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>Actually, I might try setting that mac value to something sane (only just noticed it was blank when pasting this)!</p><p>As for OpenWRT, still working on getting a build, not much to report yet.</p>									</div>

					<p>I noticed that with the from the /lan/operation_mode.html page it was reporting the current mode being &quot;ap&quot;</p><p>However just to note it is not working in access point mode. It is working in bridge mode + repeater mode.<br />* When it is not in range of the original router it doesn&#039;t give off a signal. (and switches it own dhcp on)<br />* When in it is in range you can plug a computer in and it can get on the network connection from it</p><p>Thanks, as some point I may get a serial cable to have a deeper play.

Success</code></pre></div><p>This worked with dualimage=disabled set in nvram, a modified rootfs image and stock sky kernel/boot.</p><p>Worth noting that the &#039;rootfs&#039; partition (accessed via load/save/readflash/writeflash commands) actually contains the boot, kernel and rootfs. So if you want to create a custom one, you will need to generate a squashfs image for the rootfs and concatenate it onto the end of the boot and kernel images.</p><p>I was stuck for a while with mksquashfs, it was rejecting any squashfs images I created. Eventually it worked using&nbsp; &#039;squashfs-3.2-r2-wnr1000&#039; version from <a href="https://code.google.com/p/firmware-mod-kit/">firmware-mod-kit</a></p><p>To write a new rootfs partition from CFE, you&#039;ll need to get tftpd working on a laptop/PC then:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>load -tftp -raw -addr=0x80200000 192.168.2.103:newrootfs.bin -max=3599922
writeflash rootfs 0x36ee32</code></pre></div><p>This copies the newrootfs.bin file from 192.168.2.103 (via tftp) to memory address 0x80200000. Then, the writeflash command copies the contents of the memory at 0x80200000 to the rootfs partition (at 0xDA580).</p><p>You might want to backup the contents of the partitions first:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>readflash rootfs 0x003CFFFF
save 192.168.2.103:rootfs_backup.bin 0x80200000 0x003CFFFF</code></pre></div><p>This does the opposite, copies the contents of the rootfs partition into memory (at 0x80200000), then transfers that over tftp to rootfs_backup.bin at 192.168.2.103.</p><p>Sidenote, I was also able to get the original Air4400 firmware booting this way.</p></blockquote></div><p>I tried this and found myself with a kernal panic and no-boot. Repeated and still no joy. SO I re-enabled dualboot in NVRAM and then power cycled. On rebooting the unit repaired itself! Very helpful.</p>									</div>
