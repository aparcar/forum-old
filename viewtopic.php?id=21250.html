					<p>I&#039;m trying to setup QoS for my VOIP account. Here&#039;s my setup:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; * VOIP service provider: mybbvoice.com<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * adapter: Linksys SPA2102<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * router: Asus WL-500gP v1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * firmware: Kamikaze 8.09.1</p><p>I&#039;ve installed luci-app-qos and measured my bandwidth with&nbsp; <a href="http://www.speedtest.net">http://www.speedtest.net</a> to set the uplink and downlink thresholds.</p><p>For my purposes, I want VOIP to be prioritized as Express and I&#039;ll leave everything else set to the default of the QoS script: e.g. UDP &gt; Express, SSH &gt; Priority, etc.</p><p>The QoS MiniHowto (<a href="http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/MiniHowtos%282f%29QoSHowto.html">http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/MiniHowtos%2 â€¦ Howto.html</a>) says &quot;or do something simple, like mark any traffic coming from my MAC address of my ATA as 1, High.&quot; Since I can&#039;t use MAC addresses in /etc/config/qos, I created two prioritizations:</p><p>config &#039;classify&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;target&#039; &#039;Express&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;srchost&#039; &#039;192.168.1.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;dsthost&#039; &#039;192.168.1.100&#039;</p><p>config &#039;classify&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;target&#039; &#039;Express&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;srchost&#039; &#039;192.168.1.100&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;dsthost&#039; &#039;192.168.1.1&#039;</p><p>Is this correct?

					<p>Hi, Dan:</p><p>If you have LuCI installed, just add the QoS application and it allows you to properly configure TC with priorities for different types of services and protocols. </p><p>I specify the ports I use on my IP PBX and IP phones behind my OpenWRT router and prioritize them accordingly. For example, I use 5060-5080, 6060-6070 and 30000-30050 for UDP and priority. With the downstream and upstream bandwidth set for 85% of my average speed, it sounds very good with no choppiness even when doing about 10 FTP sessions down.</p><p>I&#039;ve tested this a LOT.</p><p>marc.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your note.</p><p>I do have luci-app-qos and all its dependencies installed.

					<p>To answer my own question about prioritization between the SIP proxy server and my router, it seems that residential/consumer ISPs don&#039;t look at the QoS tags in an IP packet. QoS is a feature of more expensive business class services. For most consumers, the bottleneck is the upstream traffic to their ISP which QoS can help shape.</p>									</div>

					<p>Dan:</p><p>The QoS configuration does not tag bits from the WAN to the ISP. It merely (!) prioritizes the bits you choose to go first if there is contention for bandwidth on the upstream on your OpenWRT box.</p><p>This means that you don&#039;t need the ISP upstream to do anything.</p><p>It also means that if there is no contention, then all packets are treated the same. The way to test if you have it configured properly is setup a few long FTP sessions to a remote host and then make some calls. If you don&#039;t hear clearly its not working. If you can keep adding more FTP sessions while on a call, and the call still sounds clear, then it works.</p><p>marc.</p>									</div>
