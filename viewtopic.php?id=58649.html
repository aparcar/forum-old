					<p>Dear all</p><p>I would like to add RTC support to openwrt. As it&#039;s disabled by default in openwrt images I&#039;ve to deal with buildroot. At this point I&#039;ve cloned openwrt sources (BB) and selected my platform (DraginoHE).</p><p>From here, how can I generate with buildroot the same image than openwrt Barrier Breaker image available for download? After that I could add RTC support...</p><p>I was hoping that running &quot;make defconfig&quot; will prepare my buildroot environment to generate it, but after install the image It doesn&#039;t support usb host, for example, among other lack.</p><p>Thanks<br />Sergios</p>									</div>
