					<p>I have a hosts file (19M) that I&#039;d like to use with dnsmasq to block advertising and porn sites. I uploaded this file to my router (/etc) before I realized how large it was. For some reason that worked, even though my router has only 8MB of flash.</p><p>So my question is, first of all, why am I able to upload a file to my router that&#039;s larger than the available flash memory? Is /etc stored in RAM as opposed to flash? (I have 32MB RAM.)</p><p>Second, since this file is so large, is there any way I can use it to block sites with dnsmasq without uploading it to the router? I know one solution would be to have a separate firewall/dns server, but I&#039;d like to do this on the router if possible.</p><p>Edit: Okay I&#039;m pretty sure /etc is not in RAM but in flash. Here&#039;s my disk usage before upload:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# df -h
Filesystem                Size      Used Available Use% Mounted on
rootfs                    4.6M    364.0K      4.3M   8% /
/dev/root                 2.3M      2.3M         0 100% /rom
tmpfs                    14.1M     80.0K     14.0M   1% /tmp
/dev/mtdblock3            4.6M    364.0K      4.3M   8% /overlay
overlayfs:/overlay        4.6M    364.0K      4.3M   8% /
tmpfs                   512.0K         0    512.0K   0% /dev</code></pre></div><p>Since /etc isn&#039;t listed, I think that means it falls under rootfs, which is mounted on /. And since there&#039;s only 4.3M available, there&#039;s no way I can store the hosts file there. Which is weird, because after I upload the file my disk usage is:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# df -h
Filesystem                Size      Used Available Use% Mounted on
rootfs                    4.6M      4.5M    108.0K  98% /
/dev/root                 2.3M      2.3M         0 100% /rom
tmpfs                    14.1M     80.0K     14.0M   1% /tmp
/dev/mtdblock3            4.6M      4.5M    108.0K  98% /overlay
overlayfs:/overlay        4.6M      4.5M    108.0K  98% /
tmpfs                   512.0K         0    512.0K   0% /dev</code></pre></div><p>Now rootfs is almost entirely full, but why isn&#039;t it 100% full? And, assuming this is flash, why does it say size is 4.6M as opposed to 8MB?</p><p>I guess tmpfs, which is mounted on /tmp, is my RAM. But, in that case, why does it say size is 14.1M instead of 32MB? Can I store the hosts file there or will it get wiped out on reboot?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davidkennedy85</strong> on 23 May 2015, 22:29)</p>
