					<p>Hello</p><p>The model series WDR3500-WDR4300 and WNDR3700, WNDR3800, WR1043ND and maybe some other suffer from wifi speed problems and wifi stability problems since a few month. There is a very long ticket which was created 9 month ago. The problems seem to have started shortly after BarrierBraker was released. Until now, there seems to be no solution to these problems.</p><p>I tried recent trunk for WNDR3800 and WR1043ND and the speed is a mess&nbsp; - Is it to expect that work on these models/chipsets will continue and the problems will get solved before releasing CC final?</p><p>For example, have a look at this ticket: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/17582">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/17582</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pogukotuxo</strong> on 9 May 2015, 12:59)</p>
