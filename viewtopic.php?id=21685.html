					<p>I&#039;d like to boot the WL500gP v2 from USB stick. Not to have only the rootfilesystem on the USB disk, but also to load the kernel from it.<br />My box uses the CFE 1.0.37 which does not support USB.<br />However I&#039;ve found newer versions of CFE on the Broadcom website <a href="http://www.broadcom.com/support/communications_processors/downloads.php">http://www.broadcom.com/support/communi â€¦ nloads.php</a>.<br />Has anybody tried to compile them for the WL500gP v2 and flashed the new CFE?<br />Well, I know that playing with CFE without JTAG is dangerous, however WL500gP v2 has JTAG connector available...</p>									</div>
