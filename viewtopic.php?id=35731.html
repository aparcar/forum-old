					<p>I am not sure if this is a bug or due to the fact that there is insufficient RAM.<br />I have 2 devices, 1 with 32MB RAM the other with 64MB.<br />Now I ran many services on both device but on the device with 32MB RAM it will often fail to load certain services while the 64MB RAM device could load all services successfully.<br />Is this common or it is just device specific?</p>									</div>
