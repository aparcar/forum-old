					<p>Hi,<br />I am using latest firmware(kernel 4.9.20 and wifi driver 10.3.4.0-20170421) with 3200acm. I use routers openvpn client to connect to my vpn server. My problem is on when I enable wifi drivers and start to use torrent regardless of using wifi or lan. Memory quickly fills up and no memory remains after five minutes. Everything goes back to normal i disable wifi. I think there is memory leak problem in wifi drivers when using openvpn connection.

					<p>Just installed david&#039;s latest r4049 on my WRT3200. Got a window where teen girl and wife were not using Internet. Hard to find on weekend. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> Ran a iperf test for 10 minutes without issue on 5GHz wireless and transfer rate seemed very good. As noted by others the signal info in the wireless interface page is incorrect, no info. Other thing I notice is that the signal on the 2.4 is about 6 db lower in problem areas then the OEM firmware. This is using Acrylic Wi-Fi. Not sure if this is going to be a problem or not. Had similar issue with a previous version of LEDE that had to be ditched. Looks like Marvell is finally getting someplace with the driver.</p>									</div>

					<p>WRT3200 running david&#039;s r4049 for 6 hours. Then could not access router, 192.168.1.1, from wireless and could not resolve Internet web sites from wireless. Could access router via ssh using wireless. Up until then things were running well. Too bad as I thought maybe there was finally a LEDE build that I could use as a daily driver on my wrt3200. Have now switched back to Linksys OEM. Did not have anytime to trouble shoot as teen needed Internet for school work. Had been streaming Netflix for about an hour when I noticed I could not access web sites because of no DNS resolution. I use 4.2.2.2 and 4.2.2.4 for DNS lookups, both with LEDE and Linksys. Lookups started working immediately when the wrt3200 came up on OEM. Highly unlikely these Level 3 DNS servers were having issues.</p>									</div>

There is a different notebook connected to channel 6 now and that only shows a Bitrate of 54Mbit in the 1200AC status display page. That notebook has an older wifi adapter without dual band and is much slower. All of my wireless items have older wifi adapters so don&#039;t use the maximum capability of the 1200AC. I normally access very few servers on the internet that give me the about 5Mbyte download speeds my ISP allows anyway so am happy enough as is.</p><p>REEDIT: I just changed the settings for 5G from 20MHz to 40MHz width and the Bitrate now says 300Mbit in the router status page. There are two 5G clients associated and they each show 300Mbit so maybe that is what they mean by 2-stream. I didn&#039;t know these adapters would support that speed.</p><p>UPDATE: The speedtest website gave many 25Mbit test results from various servers. I then downloaded a file at 70Mbit speeds (I am actually paying for 60Mbits) so the bogus speedtest website only shows about 28% of actual speeds. The WRT1200AC results are faster than my old TP-link.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>beginner67890</strong> on 3 May 2017, 19:26)</p>

I&#039;ve tried ad-block, but it didn&#039;t work well for me ... let me explain why. It does its work, it blocks adds basically, and does that SO well, that I can&#039;t allow some popups or ads that I do need to let through to get into some pages... I currently use the ad-block extension in Chrome, that I can disable at will if I need to ... a good examble is ad-fly, but there are others, and you can&#039;t know in advance... so , is there a workaround that you&#039;ve found that works for you?</p></blockquote></div><p>@david<br />I&#039;d also highly encourage adding adblock and the luci addon for it.&nbsp; For those that don&#039;t want it or use it can simply disable it (like dnscrypt which comes included but not enabled; although for those not using it, I&#039;d highly recommend it.&nbsp; Check out the Configuration section at <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/dnscrypt">https://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/dnscrypt</a> to learn how.&nbsp; I&#039;d recommend the &#039;cisco&#039; resolver as it uses OpenDNS&#039;s servers which are extremely fast (very low ping)).</p><p>@mariano.silva<br />It&#039;s very easy to find the domain where your needed pop-ups are coming from, and add them to the whitelist.&nbsp; In addition, adblock for LEDE comes with many blocklists to choose from which can be enabled or disabled one by one, so often you can just play with it a while to find the blocklist which is causing the problem. </p><p>It&#039;s much, much easier than having to install adblock or a similar program on every device on my network.&nbsp; And some devices which I can&#039;t install an adblock-like program on.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>starcms</strong> on 1 May 2017, 09:03)</p>
