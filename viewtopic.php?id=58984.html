					<p>Hello all,</p><p>I am hoping someone here can help me with an issue I have been trying to solve, but been unable to.</p><p>I have a Pi B+ installed with the latest RC3 version of OpenWRT.&nbsp; I have a Trendnet TU2-ET100 USB to Ethernet Adapter (ASIX chipset) which is plugged into one of the USB ports, and is happily detected and running.&nbsp; I have configured the USB-eth adaptor as eth1 (WAN), and the built in Ethernet as eth0 (LAN).&nbsp; In this configuration, everything works fine.&nbsp; Config is as per below:</p><p>[MODEM] &lt;-cable-&gt; [eth1 | Pi_OpenWRT | eth0 ] &lt;-cable -&gt; [LAN network switch]</p><p>The issue I am trying to solve is that of network bridging.&nbsp; When I bridge the networks and reboot the Pi the WebUI can no longer be accessed, nor can I SSH to the unit – it effectively disappears from the network.&nbsp; If I connect to the Pi directly with HDMI + keyboard, I can see the Pi dmesg log stops at:<br />“port 1(eth0) entering forwarding state”</p><p>If I manually remove the bridge info from /etc/config/network and&nbsp; reboot the Pi, then I can access everything again without issue.&nbsp; </p><p>Any help or guidance would be much appreciated.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Ross</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rossy_k</strong> on 12 Aug 2015, 05:11)</p>

					<p>OK - so I finally got this sorted.&nbsp; </p><p>After MUCH playing around and pulling my hair out, I thought I&#039;d try the latest Barrier Breaker stable release as opposed to the Chaos Calmer RC3.</p><p>Bridging worked as intended immediately with the Barrier Breaker img.&nbsp; Chaos Calmer RC3 bridging must still be a bit buggy...</p><p>Regards,<br />Ross</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rossy_k</strong> on 13 Aug 2015, 04:25)</p>
