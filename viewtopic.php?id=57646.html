					<p>I&#039;ve recently noticed the news about CC-rc1 being released and in the changelog there was a paragraph about some new security features. In particular it is claimed that there is a new package signing architecture, support for (chroot) jails and support for hardened builds. Normally I love hearing about new security features being implemented, but I&#039;ve got some questions about them and the roadmap because the information is rather scarce. </p><p><strong>News post:</strong> <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=57453">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=57453</a><br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>* Improved Security Features<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Rewritten package signing architecture based on ed25519<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Added support for jails<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Added support for hardened builds</p></blockquote></div><p>So if I understand this correctly, OpenWRT will finally add support for package signing so that whenever an update is performed via opkg, we can be sure that the downloaded packages are in fact authentic? How are the hardened builds going to work? Will we have to build all packages ourselves with some added compiler options or will there be a repository for hardened packages? And what hardening features does this build bring - stack/heap canaries, ASLR, DEP/NX/XD, RBAC, etc - is there a list? </p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>As far as I can tell hardened builds options are present in CC, if you want a hardened build just recompile OpenWrt for your appliances. I started maintaining hardened builds for some of my routers.</p><p>Also, I noticed in Trunk that hardening options got enabled by default now. I&#039;d rather choose security over performance in some cases at least for capable devices.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;d be interested in more info on how to actually build hardened Chaos Calmer builds, i.e. which options should be enabled in menuconfig and what caveats you have to be aware of when doing so?

					<p>Thanks medber.</p><p>I built and flashed my first hardened OpenWrt Chaos Calmer image yesterday. Seems to work fine so far. The only thing that wasn&#039;t straightforward was the required change to the kernel configuration, since that can&#039;t be done using the usual OpenWrt config or diffconfig files. I had to adjust my build script for that as I run my builds automated and non-interactively. Anyway, the logs look good. I didn&#039;t notice any slowdown or so (well, I wasn&#039;t expecting that anyway because my router is only under light load most of the time, so I&#039;m not close to any bottleneck performance-wise).</p>									</div>
