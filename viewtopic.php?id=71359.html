					<p>Hey everyone!</p><p>I tried to go back to the original firmware on my router but it was not an easy task for some reason.</p><p>I was trying to flash it using WinSCP and after uploading the file to the router for some reason it reboot and now it&#039;s rebooting over and over again. I tried flashing it via TFTP but I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;m using the correct static ip (I tried 192.168.0.66, 192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2) I managed to do this process just fine with a 741 and no problems. I read about using some packet tracer to check what IP is it trying to access, is that right?</p><p>I think the router is not going into failsafe mode or I&#039;m not sure how to do it. Whenever I turn it on, all the lights light up, then the before last light turns orange, then all lights turn off but the first one and after some seconds the process restarts. If I try to get into failsafe mode and keep the reset button pressed, all the lights turn off but the power and the lock one (first and last one). And again, after some seconds all lights turn back on and the process starts again.</p><p>I read about flashing it via serial but I want to avoid opening the router and finding where is my arduino to use it as a serial converter.</p><p>Thanks everyone, I really hope you could give me a hand with this!</p>									</div>
