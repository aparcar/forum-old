					<p>Hello,</p><p>I found this library : <a href="http://www.yassl.com">http://www.yassl.com</a>/</p><p>The main implementation claims (partial) OpenSSL compatibility. There is a C implementation in development - cYaSSL - targetted for small footprint.</p><p>There is already matrixssl in OpenWrt repositories but the OpenSSL compatibility is a good point. However I don&#039;t know exactly how far goes the compatibility with cYaSSL for now.</p><p>Does anyone knows it or tested it ?</p><p>ffrrrr</p>									</div>

					<p>I tried to compile openvpn against cyassl but the implimentation is not complete enough.<br />(didn&#039;t bother to submit it as don&#039;t see the point in loads of libraries being added where we still have the useful apps (hostapd / wpa_supplicant / openvpn) compiled against openssl. (even getting one of them working reliably would be good but I have had no such luck yet)</p>									</div>

					<p>I doubt the ubiquiti will listen to a request like that, because they push their airos, like mikrotik does with its RouterOS. By the way, all this looking around for informations is really stessing, as everyone talks only to literate and never take time to introduce concepts to freshers.<br />For example, we know that hostapd is supporting 802.11n from 0.6.7 version. Should I understand that similar steps should also be taken on the client side? When using wpa_supplicant, what I&#039;m supposed to do? SHould I pre-configure the interface with the iw utility, or should I assume a certain level of automatic configuration?</p>									</div>
