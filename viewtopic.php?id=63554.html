					<p>Dear All,</p><p>Hello from my first post on the OpenWrt forum.</p><p>This is my situation: In my study I have the main ADSL2 modem/router at 192.168.1.1 working as the only DHCP in my LAN. I have my PC and a PowerLan adapter wired to it and a printer into its USB connector. In the living room behind the TV I have another router working as a switch with its IP manually set to .5, redistributing what’s coming out of the power socket. On the other side of the apartment I have a third router (a Comtrend VR-3025u) connected to the Internet over PowerLan which used to work with the stock firmware as a second AP and as a NAS with a hard disk plugged into the USB port. I gave it IP 192.168.1.10</p><p>Then I discovered OpenWrt and decided that it would be really nice to have the latter also acting as a torrent client. I replaced the firmware with Barrier Breaker 14.07 / LuCI Trunk (0.12+svn-r10530), added USB support, installed Transmission and the corresponding web interface, configured port forwarding on the main router and got it all running. Well, almost. ;-)</p><p>I am able to get to 192.168.1.10:9091 no problem from anywhere in the house, but an outside connection to my.dyndns.net:9091 gets refused. 8-/ I think I opened the firewall on OpenWrt, under Network -&gt; Firewall -&gt; Traffic Rules it reads: &quot;Any traffic - From any host in any zone To IP 192.168.1.10 at port 9091 on this device – Accept input - Enabled&quot;. That’s minor.</p><p>But what really bothers me is the Samba part. I want that shared disk to be open to any device on the LAN but no luck. I’ve been tinkering with the settings, but for now, the share is visible, but clicking on the drive makes Windows ask for a username and a password. I tried any combination of “root”, “guest” or Windows user with the OpenWrt password and without, and even some Windows user passwords to no avail, it won’t let me in. I’ve read <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/usb-storage-samba-webinterface">this topic</a>, but it didn’t solve anything, my Luci interface looks different, but the settings are just as the article shows, the only real difference is that I use a “nested” mount point /mnt/nas. Accessing downloaded torrents in /mnt/nas/transmission/download with WinSCP works, but is not quite what I had in mind.</p><p>For those who understand what it all does, I paste the Samba config files below.</p><p>I’d be very grateful for pointing me in the right direction.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Template in Luci, Services -&gt; Network Shares -&gt; Edit Template:
