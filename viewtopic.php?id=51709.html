(That you can fall back to).<br />When you want to upgrade the system that is not used is deleted and written over with the new upgraded firmware.<br />You restart and you then use the new install.<br />If the install fails and you cant start the new system after reboot you just boot back in to the old system that is still there and worked before the upgrade.</p>									</div>

					<p>Lots of things would be cool but aren&#039;t possible. Flying pigs for example.</p><p>Nonetheless. Most routers barely have enough flash to support <em>one</em> full working copy of Openwrt, let alone two. On &gt;=16MB routers you might have a chance, if you either replace the bootloader or develop a custom interjecting boot redirector.</p>									</div>
