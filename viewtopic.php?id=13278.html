					<p>It seems that Sveasoft has support for Wrt-350N, what&#039;s status with openwrt&#039;s support for wrt350n?<br />I&#039;ve been thinking already for awhile about buing a new router or two, and 350n would seem to be best choice, unfortunately, I do not want to run it with stock firmware, (nor dd-wrt or sveasoft), and as openwrt has not yet provided support for this device, I haven&#039;t bought it, as it would be a shame if it just would be getting some dust over it in the table without any use..</p><p>Oh..

					<p>As I understand it, OpenWRT has no driver support for the GigE switch.&nbsp; That means there is no network support.&nbsp; IIRC, someone was able to load the binary wifi driver and make that function, but it doesn&#039;t work by default either.&nbsp; &nbsp; What it comes down to is this: other firmwares are folding the proprietary drivers into their systems, while the OpenWRT devs prefer to avoid this if at all possible.&nbsp; I would recommend against purchasing one.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you. This was a great answer, there has been some discussion about this subject in the past, but this post was very informative about what&#039;s going on with supporting this device.</p><p>Maybe I then should look for other device(s) instead. What would be recommended? On the paper wrt350n is very promising, gigabit lan(well, I only got 1 device that supports it;)), wireless-N(2 devices in my network support it), nice amount of RAM, faster processor(old wrt54gs&#039;s seem slow) and USB is great, I know there are ways to install a card reader to e.g. wrt54gs, but my soldering skills aren&#039;t that great, also parts in finland cost a lot, so if I&#039;d install such technology to wrt54gs, I would propably get a wrt350n with price of parts.. Also USB is nicer as you can use it also with other devices than just with memory sticks.. Although that&#039;s not so useful, but I like the idea of possibility..</p>									</div>
