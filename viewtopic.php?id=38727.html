					<p>Hello.</p><p>I&#039;m new to Linux and OpenWRT. I got my TP-Link WR1043ND v1.8 today and wanted to flash it to OpenWRT. And there my problems begun <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>After flashing the stock firmware to OpenWRT I suffered from the WAN port not working. I followed Benjamin Eikel (on <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/11898)">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/11898)</a> and flashed to a trunk version r33181. WAN port was indeed flashing since then. Soon I realized those trunk versions don&#039;t come with a GUI. I can&#039;t install Luci right now, because I&#039;m behind a proxy and I&#039;m not familiar with setting up OpenWRT, not to mention to work with the console. So first, I&#039;d like to go back to the stock firmware or any OpenWRT with a GUI.</p><p>I was trying to write the new firmware with the MTD cmd, first as I could find everywhere via &quot;mtd write firmware.trx linux&quot;, which resulted in &quot;Could not open mtd device: linux Can&#039;t open device for writing!&quot; Found out that the partition (what I believe those are) is called &quot;kernel&quot; in my case. [Edit: Which is not true. Should have been &quot;firmware&quot;, see <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd#flash.layout">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl- … ash.layout</a>]</p><p>cat /proc/mtd gives<br />mtd0: 00020000 00010000 &quot;u-boot&quot;<br />mtd1: 000fec00 00010000 &quot;kernel&quot;<br />mtd2: 006d1400 00010000 &quot;rootfs&quot;<br />mtd3: 00560000 00010000 &quot;rootfs_data&quot;<br />mtd4: 00010000 00010000 &quot;art&quot;<br />mtd5: 007d0000 00010000 &quot;firmware&quot;</p><p>My problem now:<br />I cannot flash the firmware with MTD. Getting &quot;Could not open mtd device: kernel Can&#039;t open device for writing!&quot;</p><p>The firmware (trx) is sitting in the router in /tmp already (uploaded with WinSCP). I made this trx from openwrt-ar71xx-tl-wr1043nd-v1-squashfs-factory.bin.</p><p>Any hints for me on how to proceed?</p><p>Chris2k</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Chris2k</strong> on 17 Aug 2012, 15:10)</p>

					<p>Be happy that the router refused to write the firmware, otherwise you would have very likely bricked it.</p><p>In order to revert to the vendor firmware, you need to prepare it accordingly - which is described in the wiki. Without doing that, you overwrite kernel, rootfs and art (which is device specific and can&#039;t be recovered from firmware downloads) with u-boot and the rest at wrong offsets. Once you followed the wiki, you can flash to &quot;firmware&quot;, not &quot;linux&quot; - but make very sure that you followed the wiki and actually understand those procedures first.</p><p>Personally I&#039;d suggest to configure the WAN port of your router via cli (the wiki has excellent info about using UCI and doing it via /etc/config/ might be even easier) and then just install LuCI afterwards, if you build your own firmware, it&#039;s easy to include luci-mod-admin-full right ahead.</p>									</div>

So I gave that up and flashed the firmware partition. At least now I know how those memory stuff is organized. Unfortunately, something did went wrong (I can&#039;t even say what) and the router is constantly rebooting now (LEDs flashing repeatedly at a slow rate). Hooked up a scope on the TX pin and I can see it toggling during the boot up. I will be able to revive it, just have to get my hands on a LVTTL level shifter <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>One question though: Why is my /proc/mtd different from other people? The sizes of the mtd:s differ. On <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd</a> you can see another router&#039;s output. Does that depend on the firmware that runs on the device?</p><p>Chris2k</p>									</div>

					<p>Yep, I meant the sizes of the different mtd&#039;n&#039; partitions.</p><p>Got my router back to work via a serial connection (with help of the German website <a href="http://www.loggn.de/tl-wr1043nd-bricked-wlan-router-wieder-zum-leben-erwecken/">http://www.loggn.de/tl-wr1043nd-bricked … -erwecken/</a> ). Used putty and a tftp server like proposed on that website. </p><p>I think I know what went wrong during the flash process. I took the most current OpenWRT factory firmware image, and I think I chopped off the first 32 Bytes (Bits?) with dd. I guess that was a mistake and I should have flashed the untouched bin instead.</p><p>Chris2k</p>									</div>

					<p>Just for the record: On my second attempt I found out that opkg can be directly configured to run behind a proxy server (/etc/opkg.conf -&gt; http_proxy) which works like a charm for me. I&#039;ve installed the trunk firmware r33181 yet again and worked myself through the settings. Luci is up now and the WAN port is running as well.</p>									</div>
