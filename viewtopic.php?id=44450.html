					<p>Hi,</p><p>After moving from dd-wrt to Openwrt in a TP-Link WR842ND to integrate transmission in the router I&#039;m quite happy with the change but I&#039;m stuck in one thing that I&#039;m not able to solve and I would appreciate some help (not a Unix expert)</p><p>My set-up:<br />- firmware:OpenWrt Barrier Breaker r36713 / LuCI Trunk (svn-r9829) <br />- added packages: kmod-usb-storage;transmission set<br />- USB fat HDD</p><p>Everything runs smoothly, usb mounts automatically and I&#039;m able to manage torrent files and save everything into the USB HDD.</p><p>The problemcomes when trying to access the USB drive from a client. I&#039;m able to mount the drive, but there is no way I can make it writable (I only can read files).</p><p>/etc/exports:<br />/mnt/usb&nbsp; &nbsp; *(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,insecure,all_squash)</p><p>I access it from OSX Mountain Lion or Raspberry Pi:<br />mount -o rw 192.168.1.2:/mnt/usb /home/pi/HDDVirtual</p><p>When I try to write to the dir I always get the message: permission denied.</p><p>I&#039;ve played with all kind of changes in exports and mount parameters reflected in different posts but without any succcess.</p><p>How should I set it up to have rw access? I&#039;m not concerned about security since the HDD is only for movies and it is internal.</p><p>Thanks a lot for your help.</p>									</div>

					<p>ML should be able to read and write Fat. I can&#039;t write to NTFS without third party software (whose name I can&#039;t remember).<br />It could be a permissions issue. In Terminal on ML, what is the output of ls -al on the FAT drive?</p>									</div>

					<p>At the end I&#039;ve set it up samba for easier access. I was not using NTFS but fat and I&#039;ve found it is much easier to use Samba</p><p>What I don&#039;t know is if there is too much difference in performance between both.</p>									</div>
