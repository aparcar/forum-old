					<p>I&#039;m sorry, I missposted this in the WhiteRussian forum first time round so apologies to those who&#039;ve seen it twice.</p><p>Versions of siproxd prior to 0.6.0 don&#039;t proxy RTCP data and WhiteRussian uses version 0.5.11 with 0.5.13 in kamikaze and backports (I think)<br /><a href="http://www.3cx.com/PBX/RTCP.html">http://www.3cx.com/PBX/RTCP.html</a></p><p>I used siproxd 0.5.13 on my Debian etch and Smoothwall firewalls, the result was that data streams that utilise RTCP (usually Video) operate at a much lower quality through siproxd than they would otherwise.</p><p>try ekiga or x-lite video calls, they look terrible with the mosaic effect mentioned in the siproxd forums<br /><a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3025301">http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3025301</a><br /><a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=4893984">http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=4893984</a></p><p>Conversely I just put lenny and siproxd 0.7.0 on a spare box inside my network and video calls look fantastic, plus my other SIP clients all connect simultaneously with no random disconnects or any of the other weirdness I usually associate with multiple SIP clients using STUN &amp; NAT rather than a proxy.</p><p>Although I don&#039;t currently run OpenWrt I have in the past and I would like to use in on 2 boxes with WiFi disabled to route SIP traffic from / to my high-security network and the intermediate guest and WiFi network, without having to open up vast numbers of ports between multiple host.&nbsp; I&#039;m also trying to setup firewalls using OpenWrt / X-wrt (or DD-WRT or another) for low throughput situations that don&#039;t warrant a full PC with either Debian or Smoothwall.</p><p>If no one is interested in this I&#039;ll have a look at doing it myself in a few of months time but I&#039;m working flat out at the moment on other projects and this is well outside my area of expertise</p><p>Thanks everyone for your time and effort</p>									</div>
