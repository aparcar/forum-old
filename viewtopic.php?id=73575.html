					<p>Hi everybody,</p><p>Since I have a very low speed adsl connection at home, I plan to buy a router and a 4G dongle. (I already tried a 4G router at home and I have amazing speed).<br />At first I was planning to buy a asus or a synology rt1900ac because those routers can handle dualwan with a wan being a usb 4g dongle.</p><p>But can I do that with OpenWRT ?<br />I read that OpenWRT can manage a USB 4G dongle.<br />I also read that OpenWRT can manage dual wan ( with a package named mwan3 ?)<br />But I&#039;d like to be sure OpenWRT is able to do dualwan with the usb 4g dongle. <br />If so, I would buy a compatible TP-link router like the TL-WR902AC for example. </p><p>Thank you</p><p>Ps: Sorry for my english, it&#039;s not my first language.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes you can do that.&nbsp; About any router that has a USB port and will run OpenWrt can work.&nbsp; Don&#039;t buy a router that has only 4 MB flash and / or 32 MB RAM though.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 18 Mar 2018, 15:25)</p>

					<p>Use ROOter (<a href="http://ofmodemsandmen.com">http://ofmodemsandmen.com</a>) to connect USB 4G dongle (check, that firmware exactly for your router exists on the page). I haven&#039;t managed to run USB 4G dongle in ordinary OpenWRT. Yes, mwan.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ulmwind</strong> on 18 Mar 2018, 17:10)</p>

					<p>Hello, </p><p>Thank you for ur answeers. <br />So to be sure I buy the correct one, not exactly every router running OpenWRT are compatible, but it HAS to be in the list of the ROOter website, right ? And every router that are on this list are inevitably compatible with openwrt ?<br />What is ROOter exactly ? A module I have to install inside openwrt like mwan3 ?<br />Let says for example I would like to do it with the TP-Link Archer C5 V2.0 I couldnt.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tboy</strong> on 18 Mar 2018, 22:01)</p>
