					<p>Hi Devs,</p><p>I&#039;m building my first OpenWRT Image from buildroot at the time. A couple of Files (uClibc and busybox) are no longer at the original sites for download. I have changed my local Makefile to point to the newest versions of both. The build runs through without errors now.</p><p>Wouldn&#039;t it be better to point to the &quot;snapshot&quot; file instead of the dated version. This way you always get a download. Of course this could be a problem if a version comes out that is incompatible. The dated versions are removed when they&#039;re older than a month or two as far as I could see.</p><p>Another thing: It would be nice if the make process ended with something like &quot;OpenWRT built successfully!&quot; or the sort instead of &quot;sed -e &quot;1s,^W54S,W54G,&quot; &lt; openwrt-gs-code.bin &gt; openwrt-g-code.bin&quot; like it does now.</p><p>Since I&#039;m comfortable with buildroot (I work on different similar projects - OpenEmbedded, OpenSIMpad etc.) this doesn&#039;t bother me, but it could be confuse first time users.</p><p>Chris Martin</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, we&#039;re aware of the missing snapshots.</p><p>The reason why we do use dated snapshots is to ensure that patches apply cleanly and that the latest cvs commit hasn&#039;t completely broken things. I&#039;d rather have people complaining that they can&#039;t compile than complain that they compiled a bad image and now need help restoring.</p>									</div>

					<p>Speaking of dead links for b4-pre-20040509...</p><p>Bridge-utils 0.9.6 link is dead. Bridge-utils has to be downloaded using sf.net mirrors. In addition, 0.9.7 is available.</p><p>Dnsmasq 2.6 link is dead as well, as 2.7 and 2.8 are available. 2.6 now sits in archive directory.</p><p>I&#039;m thinking of two solutions to this. The first is the most obvious : setting a unique storage mirror for third party software where it could get downloaded without problem. The second one could be a sort of configuration file that would get downloaded first and would specify :<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. available versions<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. where to download them<br />It could dramaticly simplify third party software integration, even allow alternative links.</p>									</div>

					<p>for download links problems, we could use this :</p><p>- wget --spider url to check each urls,<br />- create un buildroot a make -openwrt-check-urls that take all urls for make/* and procede to an url check,<br />- may be it&#039;s possible for each targets to define a TARGET_DL_URL and use that information in a loop.</p>									</div>

					<p>Maybe it would be wise to setup a mirror for the dated build dependencies, like uclib and busybox. If you can shoot me the originals I can probably put something online somewhere.</p><p>.darrel.</p>									</div>

					<p>As a first time openwrt user this annoyed the *&amp;^*&amp;^ out of me.&nbsp; I used a different snapshot and bricked my unit because of login changes to busybox.</p><p>I think the idea of a mirror is a very good one.&nbsp; Somewhere, someone suggested recreating the missing mirrors from their CVS repositories by checking out by date (using the date on the snapshot we were using).&nbsp; This worked for me, but what a hassle, it hardly encouraged me to get involved or contribute.....</p>									</div>

					<p>I also feel the same. Building toolchain for openwrt is really such a pain. It&#039;s a big drag for the deveopers who want to get involved.</p><p>Openwrt is already being used by many users. It&#039;s build process should not be limited to just few developers. At least there must a document to guide the new developers. Nobody can even imagine what that build script is doing and what are dependenices.</p><p>I am not blaming anybody. It&#039;s just a suggestion to make openwrt more accessible to developers.</p><p>-Manu<br />---------<br />Manu Garg<br /><a href="http://manugarg.freezope.org">http://manugarg.freezope.org</a></p>									</div>
