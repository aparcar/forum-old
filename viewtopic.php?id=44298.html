					<p>I was having problems with the latest firmware. The settings keep reverting to factory setting after turning it off.</p><p>So, I tried to revert back to previous version of firmware, the one I already test before.</p><p>After updating the firmware, however, the router can not start at all. The light that normally goes blinking for some seconds then turning blue, now after one second only shows red color, then stops. I have tried waiting, but after five minutes, it&#039;s still like that (red led, not blinking).</p><p>I have also tried reset button. But still the same.</p><p>Is there anyway to re-flash the firmware at this condition?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>
