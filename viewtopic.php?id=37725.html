					<p>hi all,</p><p>i have a TP Link TP-WR703n which i have installed OpenWRT on sucessfully.&nbsp; I am new to Linux and OpenWRT.&nbsp; I have since discovered that the modem doesnt have enough memory to install some new applications without utilising its USB port for extra storage. The problem is I need to remove some apps to free up space before I can install the new stuff.&nbsp; I have tried removing Luci to free up space but it is still on the modem....I dont know what items are safe to delete without bricking the thing.&nbsp; Is there a way to create a fresh install and remove all the additional items that I had installed so I can start again?&nbsp; Re-flashing it seems to leave the additional items still on it. As I said, I;m very new to all this, It took me quite some time to figure out how to change the devices settings to get the network setup and it online.&nbsp; This forum has been a great help.</p><p>Thanks in advance</p><p>Dave</p>									</div>

					<p>ok thanks.&nbsp; hopefully someone else has a bit more info on the matter that can help out too.&nbsp; I&#039;ll have a look at creating the image this weekend.&nbsp; As you say that it creates a &quot;fresh&quot; openwrt image, would that remove everything else that is installed on the modem when i flash it with that image?&nbsp; I have an image for my modem as downloaded from the openwrt website.&nbsp; Can i not just flash that over in such a way that anything else installed on the modem is removed?</p>									</div>
