					<p>I have flashed two other wdr4300s with Openwrt with no problems. I just got a new unit running 3.14.3 and I am unable to flash the router. 1st tried web route renaming to match OEM name, failed. Next TFTP and it failed also after downloading the image. I looked back in the terminal window and saw a message &quot;product id verify failed&quot; than it autoboots.&nbsp; I see on the TP-Link web site that the firmware is for USA only and I also saw in a news release that TP-Link was going to comply with a FCC request to block 3rd party software.<br />Not sure if anyone else has seen this before. Any help would be great!</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the push in the correct direction. After reading the numinous processes that people were using I did get Openwrt installed on my TL-WDR4300. FYI&nbsp; this is what worked for me. </p><p>Went to ddwrt’s site , Beta area “ <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/site/support/other-downloads”">http://www.dd-wrt.com/site/support/other-downloads”</a>&nbsp; opened up the 2016 folder and the current month. Found the files for the TLWDR4300 and downloaded tl-wdr4300_us-webflash.bin . I was able to install DDwrt on the router. <br />Next I downloaded the web revert from the general release area of ddwrt for the TL-WDR4300 “tl-wdr4300v1-webrevert.rar “. After extracting the bin I was able to go back to an older version of TP-Link firmware that supported Openwrt upgrade. <br />Next download and install the standard openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wdr4300-v1-squashfs-**factory**.bin . <br />Than upgraded to the final Openwrt firmware…</p>									</div>
