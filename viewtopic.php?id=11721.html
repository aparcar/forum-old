					<p>I would like to expand a little on Point 1, the creation of DSA keys.</p><p>I normally have logcheck process my logs, and it does so hourly via cron as the logcheck user.&nbsp; </p><p>The logcheck user is a virtual user, it exists solely to own some files, and to be a user to process logs.&nbsp; In the /etc/passwd file, it shows that the login shell that logcheck gets is /bin/false.&nbsp; The postgres user is one which can get a shell, but can never login (no passwords are accepted).&nbsp; To do work as the postgres user, the root user needs to &#039;su&#039; to the postgres user.&nbsp; This same process doesn&#039;t work with the logcheck user, as the login shell is /bin/false.</p><p>While there are other ways to accomplish key generation, what I did was run the &#039;chsh&#039; program to give logcheck a real shell.&nbsp; The root user could then &#039;su&#039; to the logcheck user.&nbsp; The home directory for logcheck is defined to be /var/lib/logcheck, which is fine for what needs to be done.&nbsp; As noted in the original posting, you run the ssh-keygen program for DSA keys (-t dsa).&nbsp; Don&#039;t use a passphrase (just hit return, twice I believe).&nbsp; All dsa keys are the same size, so you don&#039;t get asked anything about that.&nbsp; As mentioned above, copy this newly created dsa pub key to the OpenWRT device, and then append that file to the authorized_keys file for dropbear.&nbsp; Stop being the logcheck user by exiting the shell logcheck is running (exit should work, a single Control-D is end-of-file, which is what I normally do).&nbsp; Finally, run &#039;chsh&#039; again (as the root user now), to change the login shell for logcheck back to /bin/false.</p><p>This should allow cron processes run by the logcheck user to login to OpenWRT using public key authentication using SSH2.</p>									</div>
