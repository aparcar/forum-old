					<p>Hello everyone, </p><p>I have read other people with the same router unable to type anything in the serial as they were getting 0 volt on TX and therefore they had to solder a resistor from TX to VCC in order to be able to type into serial console. </p><p>I guess I am in the same situation. </p><p>I am wondering if anybody knows what is the resistor voltage I need to solder. I read of somebody guessing 10k ohms, but I&#039;d rather be sure and avoid frying it up.</p><p>Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Latrina</strong> on 12 Aug 2015, 18:11)</p>

Since you use the routers Vcc, which is 3,3 V, you can&#039;t damage the device by using any other resistance, as that is the same voltage of the serial adapter. The resistance mainly matters to meet the voltage levels that the router can sense as distinct high or low.</p>									</div>
