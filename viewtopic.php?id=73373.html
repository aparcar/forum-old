					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have installed OpenWRT on a brand new Netgear R7800. All went well and was easy peasy. But I wanted to go back to the original Netgear firmware and I got stuck. I first downloaded the latest firmware from the site, reset the router, used TFTP to transfer the file to the router and let it reboot.</p><p>But then all went not so well. Now my router has two IP&#039;s. When I open 192.168.1.1 I got an error message from OpenWRT saying &#039;No such file or directory&#039;. When I open 192.168.1.2 Netgear re-routes to the install website, but after that I can&#039;t install anything.</p><p>How can I fix this guys? I&#039;m totally stuck here. Any tips for me?</p>									</div>

					<p>Flashing the OEM firmware using the TFTP recovery method should work.</p><p>Where did that 192.168.1.2 surface?</p><p>You may need to clear your browser cache or use another browser, as sometimes the browser remembers too much.</p><p>And I hope that you also rebooted your PC to make sure of the DNS settings etc.</p>									</div>

					<p>I finally succeeded in updating the router with the stock firmware. I used TFTP to upload an older firmware version. After rebooting I reset the router again and then I finally have the Netgear portal in front of me. Pfeww... thanks for your help any way!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vicje</strong> on 25 Feb 2018, 11:14)</p>
