					<p>I have loaded Barrier Breaker on a wndr3800 with both wireless radios disabled.&nbsp; However, approximately every 5 seconds, I see the message &quot;interface tmp.radio0 deleted&quot; displayed twice in the log.&nbsp; I assume this has something to do with both wireless radios (even though both messages reference radio0).</p><p>Any idea why this message keeps appearing?</p>									</div>

DD-WRT actually uses a lot of openwrt code. </p><p>As far as bugs go, DD-WRT is much more likely to have regressions and have unfixed bugs due to so much legacy crap left over from the early WRT54G days.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drawz</strong> on 7 Oct 2014, 06:30)</p>
