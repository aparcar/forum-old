					<p>So I need a command I can issue that will cause a currently connected device (be it through ethernet or wireless) to disconnect.&nbsp; It is OK if the device reconnects after, I just need it to disconnect temporarily.&nbsp; Another option is a command to close all ports associated with an IP address or mac address.&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp; I&#039;ve searched extensively and, surprising enough, was unable to find it.</p>									</div>

					<p>hi, same that you have kmod-ipt-conntrack or kmod-nf-conntrack, both don&#039;t work together. However, a kernel module is not on user workspace, don&#039;t worry about it (always main always that kernel need it). Regards.</p>									</div>

There&#039;s no way for the server to tell a client that their lease has expired or terminated. The server can give the terminated address to a new client, but if the old client is still using it, that will merely cause network clashes, but it doesn&#039;t guarantee that the old client will go away.</p><p>This has been a known problem ever since DHCP was created - see Section 7, &quot;Security Considerations,&quot; in&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2131.txt">RFC 2131</a>.</p>									</div>
