					<p>Hi,<br />my tp-link 4300 is connected over a wlan-bridge to another lan and from that to the internet.<br />I&#039;m afraid, that autonegotiation between the 4300 and the connected netgear wg102 is not working correctly.<br />The Wan-port of the 4300 is 1000Mb/s and the lan-port of the wg102 is 100Mb/s.<br />I have only data-rates of around 1MB/s, so i suspect, that the speed is handled down to 10Mb/s.<br />I tried to set the speed on the 4300 to fixed 100Mb/s with ethtool without success (ethtool -s eth0 speed 100).<br />The speed stays at 1000Mb/s.</p><p>Linux OpenWrt 3.10.32 #1 Thu Mar 6 04:04:35 MST 2014 mips GNU/Linux</p><p>Is it not possible to set a fixed speed?</p>									</div>
