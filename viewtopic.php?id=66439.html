					<p>I&#039;m trying to track down whether the slow DL speeds are from the router, or from the modem/connection with my ISP before I get on the phone with them.</p><p>I just got upgraded from 25/2.5 Mbps to 150/15 Mbps and can only hit ~32Mbps down on DSLReports or Speedtest.net. Upstream hits about 16Mbps, so that&#039;s no problem. Could easily saturate 25Mbps before.</p><p>Got a new modem from the ISP, set to bridged mode. I didn&#039;t try it un-bridged directly.</p><p>I&#039;m using Arokh&#039;s build, r49166.</p><p>Had SQM set for ~90% of previous speed, but tried both setting to ~90% of new speed, and disabling SQM entirely. Same result.</p><p>I don&#039;t see abnormal load on the router, and everything else is pretty stock.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>DangerZone</strong> on 17 Aug 2016, 19:19)</p>

					<p>Do you mean slow downloads via wireless clients, wired clients, or both?</p><p>If wireless:</p><p>Arokh&#039;s build has the transmit power on both radios set to the max. Do you see any improvement if you lower these, perhaps 23 for the 5Ghz and 23 for the 2.4 Ghz?</p>									</div>
