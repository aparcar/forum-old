					<p>Hi, folks!</p><p>I like OpenWrt very much, having been able to transform my Linksys NSLU2 to a Printer Server, NFS Server etc.</p><p>But to tell you the truth, I am quite frustrated because of the really bad documentation. There *is* a lot of documentation, but scattered on very different places, making it very difficult to find the right information. </p><p>There is:<br />* a more or less &quot;official&quot;, but very incomplete documentation: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/docs/openwrt.html">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/docs/openwrt.html</a><br />* a Wiki containing much information, but which is really a mess: Often it is difficult to guess whether the docu is for Whiterussian or Kamikaze; the directory structure is really inconsequent - e.g. you have <br />/UsbStorageHowto <br />/OpenWrtDocs/Kamikaze/Timezones <br />/OpenWrtDocs/KamikazeConfiguration/UCI <br />/OpenWrtDocs/OpnenWrtDocs/KamikazeBootScriptsHowTo <br />All of these pages contain information for configuring kamikaze - do you consider this logical?<br />* the &quot;Howtos and Documentation&quot; section of this forum.</p><p>Today I found out something that might be interesting for other users, too; I wanted to share that, writing it to a wiki page, but I gave up, not knowing where I should put it. Is there anybody facing the same problems? Wouldn&#039;t it be great to have a well-structured wiki helping the newbies to find the information they need? Who would be able and interested in improving the situation? (I tried to rename the page /OpenWrtDocs/OpnenWrtDocs/KamikazeBootScriptsHowTo to /OpenWrtDocs/KamikazeBootScriptsHowTo but was not able to do so...)</p><p>What do you think about it?</p><p>Cheers,<br />Christoph</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ChrDr</strong> on 16 Feb 2009, 12:43)</p>

					<p>The wiki is pretty bad and probably outgrew itself a long time ago. It needs alot of work and organization.</p><p>Since the nature of a wiki is collaboration, if some people are interested in it we can probably go through and organize it over the course of a few days.</p>									</div>
