					<p>I have been trying out bandwidthd lately on my home router (Archer c7) because of the comcast 300gb data caps. I really like it but I have one problem. It seems to record all data. Even lan-lan. This is bad because I use network storage for sharing files inside my house. So I don&#039;t get an accurate WAN usage record. </p><p>So I tried changing &quot;/etc/config/bandwidthd&quot; from <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config bandwidthd
        option dev              br-lan
        option subnets          &quot;192.168.0.0/16 10.0.0.0/8 172.16.0.0/12&quot;
        option skip_intervals   0
        option graph_cutoff     1024
        option promiscuous      true

I assume it stopped collecting data because it is set to collect on internal subnets that are handled on br-lan so monitoring the 192.x.x.x IPs on eth0 isn&#039;t possible. </p><p>Is there any way to monitor per user WAN usage without counting lan-lan connections using bandwidthd?&nbsp; If not, Are there any similar applications?</p><p>Also, it doesn&#039;t seem to monitor any IPv6. Is ipv6 bandwidthd possible? I have been considering disabling IPv6 for now anyway because QoS doesn&#039;t work properly with it. So it isn&#039;t a big deal if I can&#039;t get it working.</p>									</div>

					<p>EDIT2: Just want to say that the config file below is actually working for me now.&nbsp; I think the reason it wasn&#039;t working before is because in the <strong>filter</strong> string there was a space between &quot;not&quot; and the opening parenthesi.&nbsp; In other words &quot;not (&quot; didn&#039;t work but &quot;not(&quot; seems to (at least this is the only difference I can think of).</p><p>So hopefully this works for you too steven.mainor.&nbsp; Also note that bandwidthd uses a big chunk of memory and will crash if it exhausts all of it, so if you have a USB port it might be wise to create a swap file on it and mount it.</p><br /><p>-------------<br />I am having the same issue, except my /etc/config/bandwidthd is different.&nbsp; I read that the solution is to change the &quot;filter&quot; option (it&#039;s a PCAP filter) with code to capture everything except traffic whose DST and SRC are both the local subnet (in my case, 192.168.0.X).</p><p>Unfortunately it doesn&#039;t work--bandwidthd captures <em>nothing</em>.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also tried replacing &quot;192.168.0.0/24&quot; in the filter with &quot;192.168.0&quot; but it still doesn&#039;t work.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config bandwidthd
