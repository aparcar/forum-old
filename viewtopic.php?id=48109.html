					<p>You can a) create your own image including NFS, SMB,... using the ImageBuilder. This is best because it compresses everything and makes it read-only. You can b) still write to the system though because OpenWrt uses an overlay filesystem, which means that your writes are transparently stored in the writeable /overlay partition and are visible as normal in /.</p>									</div>

					<p>probono, thanks for the Answere.</p><p>Actually the Dockstar runs with a USB-HDD with Debian on it.<br />alternative to Flash, can i boot openWRT from a USB-HDD?</p><p>If it is possible, is there a HowTo available?</p><p>At the moment, theres an Uboot from Jeff Doozan on it. If there is a bootable HDD plugged with an bootable System, it will boot from HDD.</p>									</div>
