					<p>Hello,</p><p>recently I installed OpenWrt on a TP-LINK router. Now I would like to control the traffic between certain hosts on the same subnet. As iptables is available on OpenWrt based routers, I thought this should be a trivial task. I am using OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05.1.</p><p>In my first attempt I simply wanted to add a new rule to Network/Firewall/Traffic Rules. For example, I want to prevent host A from talking to host B based on the MAC address of host A and the IP of host B:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Any traffic
From any host in lan with source MAC AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA (host A)
To IP W.X.Y.Z in lan (host B)
Discard forward</code></pre></div><p>This rule has been set up using OpenWrts&#039; built in Wizard. Due to the fact that this section is called &quot;traffic rules&quot;, I thought that OpenWrts takes care of adding/inserting the rule correctly. However, host A is still able to talk to host B.</p><p>In my next attempt, I manually added an iptables rule to the &quot;custom rules&quot; section, which are loaded right after the default rules:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -A FORWARD -p ALL -m mac --mac-source AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA -d W.X.Y.Z -j DROP</code></pre></div><p>So far I have not been able to get this to work. Any thoughts on this? Additionally, can anybody point me to a solution where host B will still be able to talk to host A? My approach (if working) would shut down any communication.</p><p>Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>desmo800</strong> on 23 Nov 2016, 13:48)</p>

					<p>Hi AndreL,</p><p>thanks for your reply. The Setup is quite easy and now that you mention that the clients can talk directly, it makes sense why the FORWARD rule does not affect the communication.</p><p>The router provides Wifi for a couple of clients. Additionally there is a switch connected to one of the routers&#039; ethernet ports. This means, I have 2 groups of clients: Wifi and ethernet connections. As mentioned before, all clients reside in the same subnet. So I guess using ARP, they know how to talk.</p><p>Does this mean, I have to set up a filter on br-lan? This has been set up automatically but currently I do not know how to add a filter to a bridge.</p><p>thanks </p><br /><br /><div class="quotebox"><cite>AndreL wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>If the hosts are on the same subnet they usually talk to each other directly on link.
