					<p>I eventually rolled back to the TP Link factory image. I couldn&#039;t get the LACP bond between WAN and LAN working, traffic just refused to split. Even if I did I could not test it because with default settings (clean install) I was only seeing a max of 65MBps file transfer speeds on the 802.11AC radio. With the factory image on a clean install I get 105MBps on a file copy. 40MBps (320Mbps) is a big deal for me. No idea why there was such a big difference but thats the way it was.
