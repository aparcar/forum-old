					<p>I am interested in providing a redundant path for Ethernet connectivity between two points.</p><p>In the general case, each independent path might be an Ethernet cable or a wireless bridge.</p><p>I am told that the way to do this is using Link Aggregation and running LACP.</p><p>My objective is strictly data reliability. I do NOT need the extra speed that two or more paths might provide when all are working. </p><p>Reducing the Ethernet speed from 100Mb/s to 10Mb/s would be OK. Again, bandwidth is NOT the issue.</p><p>Is it possible to do this in a low-cost router/switch running OpenWRT? I have lots of WRT54Gx boxes.</p>									</div>
