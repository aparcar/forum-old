					<p>I&#039;m currently using a WR1043ND for my home network. With Barrier Breaker, I&#039;ve used the regulation hack (<a href="http://luci.subsignal.org/~jow/reghack/README.txt">http://luci.subsignal.org/~jow/reghack/README.txt</a>) to enable to use of Channel 13 (It&#039;s allowed in our country) and it also opened up the option to select a transmit power above 20 dBm in Luci. With the new Chaos Calmer release, the use of channel 13 is possible by default, but I cannot select a transmit power of above 20dBm.</p><p>My question is: How can I re-enable the possibility of selecting a transmit power higher than 20 dBm? Does the regulation hack also apply to Chaos Calmer? Or was that hack made specifically for Barrier Breaker? I know that higher transmit powers introduce more noise, and does not increase the power at which the clients transmit. But at 20 dBm the connection is iffy in the far corners of the house, which was fixed by using a higher transmit power in the past.</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>

I could set anything from 21 to 30, but setting values above 25 did nothing. In that case, Luci always reported the transmit power status as 25, no matter what value. Values from 21 through 25 did properly work and resulted in better performance. The only problem is that I cannot set these values anymore in Chaos Calmer.</p>									</div>
