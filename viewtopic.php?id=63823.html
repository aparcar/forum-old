					<p>hi community<br />first of all, I used different versions of openwrt on different devices already, but used all time the precompiled firmware. now I want to make a step further to compile it by my own (the reason is that I need some additional packages for raspberry pi). I already set up the environment and checked out chaos calmer by git and it&#039;s compiling successfully.</p><p>what is the right way to build packages which aren&#039;t in the repo for chaos calmer (in my case lcd4linux)? </p><p>If I set up an additional trunk environment with all packages (lcd4linux is part of it) and compile the needed package, would they work with chaos calmer?</p><p>thanks for your tips</p>									</div>

Otherwise you get incompatible binaries. (trunk uses kernel 4.1 or 4.4 and &quot;musl&quot; libc, while CC15.05 uses kernel 3.18 and &quot;uClibc&quot; libc.)</p><p>If you need packages from trunk, the easiest is to compile trunk firmware. <br />(Over 99% of time, trunk is quite stable, but every now and then something may be broken. But rarely.)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 31 Mar 2016, 15:57)</p>

Most of the package Makefiles are compatible, but it is always possible that something has changed in between and the &quot;new&quot; Makefile from trunk does not work in CC15.05</p>									</div>

					<p>It was working with package lcd4linux, great!</p><p>But: by default it&#039;s building lcd4linux-custom package. I see in the makefile that there is also an lcd4linux-full package. also package mpd has two version (mpd-mini and mpd-full). how do I build a specific &quot;version&quot; of a package?</p>									</div>
