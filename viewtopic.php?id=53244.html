					<p>Good evening,</p><p>I tried to do my due diligence prior to purchasing the tp-link wr841n by researching v9 but was then shipped v9.1 and do not seem to find anything about this. </p><p>The TP-LINK website does not seem to differentiate between 9.0 and 9.1, or, at least there is only 1 single versi√≥n of firmware on their page.</p><p>Should I assume it is not supported by open-wrt at this point or should I give the instructions for the 9.0 a shot?</p><p>Any advice appreciated!</p>									</div>

					<p>most likely the v9 files will work fine, especially if TP-Link themselves do not distinguish and use a single firmware. Would be best to have an unbrick plan if it fails though! (many newer TP-Link routers have TFTP recovery mode).</p>									</div>

					<p>I followed the instructions for v9.0 on the wiki and it has resulted in a beautiful, simple flashing of my router. I had no idea it was quite this sexy under the hood. </p><p>Everything is working so far. I will update if I experience any oddities. Thank you for your response!</p>									</div>
