					<p>No ddos can be stopped ....another router I have that is connected by another isp and used for WiFi. It can stop ddos by its own TP-Link firmware. If the router detects any ip is over the value then the router auto blocks it and ip added to block list.............<br />See this image <a href="http://i.imgur.com/MvKGpCE.png">http://i.imgur.com/MvKGpCE.png</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>M@TR!X</strong> on 29 May 2015, 19:26)</p>

					<p>Most DDOS can not be stopped. It doesn&#039;t matter what you have on your router, because most DDOS is about stuffing your pipe until nothing can get through. </p><p>The only answer is to have a enterprise level DDOS protection, where your ISP (or other service provider) dumps the packets before it ever gets to you. </p><p>Oh yeah, by the way, most Enterprise level DDOS is many thousands of dollars per month <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />&nbsp; Thought you should know before you made the call. lol</p>									</div>
