					<p>Hello!<br />Actually I have two routers with OpenWRT, TPLink MR3020 and GLiNET 300M with custom modifications, scripts and other stuff.<br />Is it possible to make a full backup or image of those running routers? I want to clone them to another ones and I was thinking about two different posibilities.</p><p>1) Create a image .bin with all the o.s, configuration, files, etc... This would be great because I can flash it directly to the MR3020 in one step, because if not, i have to flash image first, and then do a restore.<br />2) Make a &quot;full backup&quot; and restore it from webgui.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried to make a normal backup throught web gui but files and scripts manually added are omited.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
