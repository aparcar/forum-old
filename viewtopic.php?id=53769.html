					<p>The simplest way is to have the wired network and the wireless sharing the same address range.<br />Instead of a static address I now configure the router to always assign a fixed address to a certain interface MAC. <br />Unless there is a reason for your current settings the easiest thing to do would be to reset the router to factory defaults. You would then need to access the LUCI from the wired LAN&nbsp; with the PC until you setup the wireless. <br />The factory defaults for my router are 192.168.1.1 and with DHCP serving in the 192.168.1.x range for both the wired and wireless clients. If you allow your PC to accept dhcp addresses from the router then you should be able to access the LUCI and then setup the wireless. Setting a static address for you PC in the 192.168.1.x range might also work except I haven&#039;t tried that for years.<br /> Good luck.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>beginner67890</strong> on 3 Nov 2014, 15:53)</p>

					<p>Remove the wlan interface and set the WiFi to lan. Its the easiest way. I would recommend you to remove the WiFi network setup and add it again. To slow only some Mac is the right way<br /> Thy first something which work, then play with it. You can look on the dd-wrt wiki too, some setups are explained platform independent.</p>									</div>
