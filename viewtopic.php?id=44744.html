					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;ve just upgraded my FTTH connection from 100Mbps to 300Mpbs. I&#039;m running openwrt AA 12.09 final release on my WNDR3800 router.</p><p>When downloading at 300Mbps (from WAN to LAN, with NAT), my CPU is very high (sirq is more than 90%), and all others process on router are freezing.</p><p>I have 2 questions:</p><p>1°) What&#039;s the maximum theoretical WAN to LAN throughput for this router ?<br />2°) Is there any way to protect the CPU by giving a lower priority to the routing process ?</p><p>Any performance feedback is welcome.</p><p>Thx</p>									</div>

					<p>According to some research on NAT performance, it might be related to the openwrt NAT implementation with iptables. Some stock firmware are using fast nat instead, with better performance (but less feature).</p><p>I also read that nf_conntrack might slowdown wan to lan throughput performance…</p>									</div>

					<p>Quoting: <a href="http://www.iptables.info/en/nat.html">http://www.iptables.info/en/nat.html</a><br />In Linux, there are actually two separate types of NAT that can be used, either Fast-NAT or Netfilter-NAT. Fast-NAT is implemented inside the IP routing code of the Linux kernel, while Netfilter-NAT is also implemented in the Linux kernel, but inside the netfilter code. Since this book won&#039;t touch the IP routing code too closely, we will pretty much leave it here, except for a few notes. Fast-NAT is generally called by this name since it is <strong>much</strong> faster than the netfilter NAT code. It doesn&#039;t keep track of connections, and this is both its main pro and con. Connection tracking takes a lot of processor power, and hence it is slower, which is one of the main reasons that the Fast-NAT is faster than Netfilter-NAT. As we also said, the bad thing about Fast-NAT doesn&#039;t track connections, which means it will not be able to do SNAT very well for whole networks, neither will it be able to NAT complex protocols such as FTP, IRC and other protocols that Netfilter-NAT is able to handle very well. It is possible, but it will take much, much more work than would be expected from the Netfilter implementation. </p><p>What hinders you to<br />&nbsp; * buy faster hardware?<br />&nbsp; * configure your existing OpenWrt-device to use Fast-NAT instead of Netfilter-NAT<br />&nbsp; * or build a custom OpenWrt-Image with Fast-NAT instead of Netfilter-NAT</p><p>Regarding faster CPU, we only have this OpenSSL-Benchmark:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/benchmark.openssl">http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/benchmark.openssl</a></p><p>Sadly, I dunno how good this relates to NAT-Performance using Fast-NAT or Netfilter-NAT.<br />There are Intruction sets: MIPS, ARM, PowerPC, etc<br />There are Intruction sets Versions: MIPS32, ARMv4 to ARMv7<br />There are implementation of these: MIPS 24Kc, MIPS 24KEc MIPS 34Kc, MIPS 74Kc, ARM 9, ARM Cortex A9<br />There are versions: e.g. MIPS 24Kc V7.4<br />There are Instruction set extensions, e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Multimedia_extensions">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:M … extensions</a> but more extensions, e.g. CESA for encryption!</p><p>Then there can be distinct DSP-Chips on the PCB. Such could be programmed to do the DSL-, Audio-, Video- or Routing-/NATins stuff instead of the CPU.</p><p>ALL of the above is real and implemented, but do not ask be about an overview. I couldn&#039;t even tell you how much faster a simple MIPS 74Kc@500MHz is then a MIPS 4Kc@500MHz. I dunno. I searched a bit around and found few to NO benchmarks at all.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks kirschwasser for this explication.</p><p>* configure your existing OpenWrt-device to use Fast-NAT instead of Netfilter-NAT =&gt; is it possbile without building a new image ? How ?</p>									</div>

					<p>I do not know. Please search the web to find a solution. The harder it&#039;ll be to find one, the more adept it&#039;ll be to document your findings in the OpenWrt wiki: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/start">http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/start</a></p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ll give this a bump, I have a wndr3700 overclocked. Using lan to wan performance, I get around 95% sirq and the whole router&nbsp; slows to a halt.</p><p>This happens when I&#039;m downloading at extremely fast speeds from Wan to lan back to WAN.</p><p>Any word on fast nat?</p>									</div>
