					<p>Well, the Wi-viz homepage says that triangulation is one of the things that it does NOT do.</p><p>As far as I understand it, you would need a directional antenna.&nbsp; Then you find out in which direction the signal is strongest.&nbsp; Then you move somewhere else and find out in which direction the signal is strongest from there.&nbsp; Then you work out where those two lines intersect.</p><p>Of course this is all more easily said than done and I am sure it&#039;s very difficult to get an accurate bearing, but if you get several readings from several different locations you should be able to tell more or less where the radio is that you are looking for.</p><p>See here for more:<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation</a></p>									</div>
