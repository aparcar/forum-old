					<p>To expand on what Sonic said, when the router boots it will think it is 1 Jan 2000.&nbsp; (4251875 minutes is just over 8 years).&nbsp; So when crond starts, it thinks it is the year 2000.&nbsp; Then an ntp client (e.g. ntpclient or ntpdate or ntpd etc.) syncs the time with a time server and suddenly crond notices it is 2008!&nbsp; It thinks that 8 years just went missing, so it complains about it.</p>									</div>

					<p>My main concern is during certificate negotiation with OpenVPN.&nbsp; I build my cert on Aug 2007 say with a lifetime until 2036.</p><p>Now the WRT boots up, thinks it January 1st 2000 and tries to talk to it&#039;s peer.&nbsp; There is immediately a problem about you are trying to use a certificate for a date in the future.&nbsp; Get me?&nbsp; Just being in a timeframe after the certificate starts seems sufficient.</p><p>I wish these things had a battery-backed clock, or at least there was a cheap option to plug in one.</p>									</div>
