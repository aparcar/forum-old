					<p>I&#039;m using OpenWRT with the Xwrt interface (I don&#039;t know if that matters).&nbsp; 3 times (with 3 different WRT54gl routers out of 10 )I&#039;ve had the problem that when I changed the LAN IP the router froze up.&nbsp; (I could not connect at new or old address.)&nbsp; On two of them I could use the reset button to go back to 192.168.1.1 and things were fine.&nbsp; </p><p>On the third.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I have gone into failsafe mode and deleted the nvram using mtd (I just reread the post that says this is !stupid!)(it worked to get me back to 192.168.1.1) and so I can return to default settings and 192.168.1.1.&nbsp; Everything works fine as long as I use 192.168.1.1, but I need it to be changed.&nbsp; <br />(I&#039;ve also tried reflashing but that didn&#039;t do much.)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>donnied</strong> on 15 Feb 2008, 03:41)</p>

					<p>The LAN address is 192.168.1.1 by default, not the WAN address. Also flashing does not affect the nvram, so that is why it would not reset the address.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m sorry it was early when I did this.&nbsp; I meant the LAN IP.&nbsp; I know.&nbsp; I entered the new LAN IP and the router freezes.&nbsp; I flashed because I thought it might have been misflashed and I needed to flash again to be able to save a new LAN IP. I had to erase nvram in order to be able to login to the router at the default 192.168.1.1 address.</p><p>Well, it froze every time with the LAN address 192.168.5.0; do I thought maybe it&#039;s the .0.&nbsp; 192.168.5.1 worked fine.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>donnied</strong> on 15 Feb 2008, 11:47)</p>

					<p>Assuming the netmask was still 255.255.255.0, 192.168.5.0 is the network address.&nbsp; It&#039;s not an address you can use as an IP address.&nbsp; You could use 192.168.5.1 up to 192.168.5.254.&nbsp; 0 is the network address and 255 is the broadcast address (with that netmask.)</p>									</div>
