					<p>I have the same problem with my dir 600b1. The SIRQ is through the roof.<br />I guess I have the same questions. I&#039;ve noticed it&#039;s during any traffic, not limited to wifi.<br />It seems this only happens when there are a lot of connections, 200+.</p><p>Is there any workaround?<br />This is on latest svn trunk (29154).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Poodlemastah</strong> on 15 Nov 2011, 16:55)</p>
