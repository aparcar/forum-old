					<p>Well my router died today, so I was going to use this as an opportunity to upgrade the hardware on my network.&nbsp; I am currently hosting a dedicated Minecraft server at a friends house (he has fiber!) for a few friends (10-20) to remotely log in.</p><p>My goal is to increase security on my network by separating the server onto either its own subnet or a VLAN, and then create a VPN so that the only way to administer the server (via ssh or web interface) is to first log in to the VPN.&nbsp; This would allow players to log into the game server easily via port-forward, but separate the server onto its own part of the network, and restrict who can gain any access to it.</p><p>OKAY so my question is:&nbsp; should I invest in a VPN firewall gateway appliance, or should I use OpenWrt/DD-WRT/Tomato flashed router to create a VPN?&nbsp; Is it possible and would it be worth it?&nbsp; If I use a consumer-grade router, such as the Netgear r4500 or similar, could I save some money and still gain functionality by changing the firmware to an open-source solution?&nbsp; Or, does a small-business firewall (like one from ZyXEL) have superior hardware that would make a difference?</p><p>What is your recommendation or experience?</p>									</div>

					<p>I went with Untangle at my work. We have the u150 for the main office and the u10 for the branch office. Connected with an OpenVPN tunnel. They&#039;ve been rock solid since purchase. That being said, they aren&#039;t cheap for the end user. The u10 is $1k plus $250/year. It is also only rated for 10 users, but I don&#039;t think that is a hard cap.</p><p>I run OpenWRT on my home router a Buffalo WZR-HP-G450H, and find it much faster than DD-WRT. Also DD-WRT that ships with the Buffalo WZR-HP-G450H is broken right now also. While the u10 has 1Gb of RAM, atom CPU, 160 GB SSD. The Buffalo WZR-HP-G450H&nbsp; has 64MB RAM, 400Mhz cpu, and 32MB flash. Specs wise, the u10 is far more capable, but you would still need a wireless gateway (if you want wireless) to connect to it. </p><p>You could build a small box and put the open source untangle on it. It would do everything you&#039;re looking for, I think. Then just buy a cheap wireless router, slap OpenWRT on it, and make put it in gateway mode.</p><p>For my home use OpenWRT is great.</p><p>-Reece</p>									</div>

					<p>I recommend to build your own firewall hardware and install pfsense - it just great<br />you can start with a configuration like <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/pfSense-2-0-3-ROUTER-FIREWALL-1GHz-SSD-Flash-VPN-DMZ-DUAL-GIGABIT-WAN-GUI-3-port-/360644784576?pt=US_Thin_Clients&amp;hash=item53f81ab1c0">this</a><br />and then add wireless interfaces on usb or pci</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>maurer</strong> on 29 Apr 2013, 08:39)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the suggestion!<br />I have considered building my own router using pfSense or even m0n0wall, but I didn&#039;t think to buy a pre-built config.&nbsp; Any idea about what makes an out-of-box &quot;firewall gateway&quot; so special it has its own customer target?</p>									</div>

					<p>a less technical admin&nbsp; - or less hardware oriented.<br />another advantage would be the sealed-box warranty<br />remeber that building your own box requires some hardware knowledge and the risk of breaking things on assembly <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve heard of Untangle from somewheres, but I don&#039;t know much about it.&nbsp; A solid option, to be sure.&nbsp; Would it have more features than a standard OpenWrt distro? I was thinking of pfSense also, although both would probably be much more than I need, since they would be running on an atom or similar x86 platform =P</p>									</div>

					<p>Untangle is a GUI, but it is a good GUI. So far, I&#039;ve not had an issue of there being something I can&#039;t do because I don&#039;t have the command line. Untangle is more like a Sonic Wall replacement. Though, I much prefer it to Sonic Wall, and it is free for what you need.</p><p>Doesn&#039;t Mikro Tik make some &quot;empty&quot; router boxes?</p><p>Also, if you got one of those type boxes you could really use what you wanted, so long as OpenWRT is compatible with the hardware. What you want to do can be done with any of the proposed options. I&#039;m really liking OpenWRT compared to DD-WRT. </p><p>-Reece</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>reece.savage</strong> on 29 Apr 2013, 17:41)</p>

					<p>Reece, are you able to tell me how you got OpenWrt on your WZR-HP-G450H?</p>									</div>
