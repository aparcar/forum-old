					<p>Hi, </p><p>I just installed OpenWRT. Works great, but I am not sure of the best way to get dhcpd running on it. I installed the florian dhcpd package, but the daemon gives me the ol&#039; &quot;protocol not available&quot; message. It needs certain kernel options (CONFIG_PACKET and CONFIG_FILTER). Is there a way to cross compile a custom kernel? </p><p>-matthew</p>									</div>

					<p>Well heck, they don&#039;t have to hide it like that! :-)</p><p>Out of curiosity though, if I had wanted to run ISC dhcpd (which I don&#039;t now since dnsmasq provides all the functionalty that i need), how would I go about doing that? If noting else, perhaps this thread could serve as a reference for someone. </p><p>-matthew</p>									</div>

					<p>For reference:</p><p>There&#039;s a broken isc dhcpd package somewhere. It&#039;s broken, don&#039;t use it. There is also a broken udhcpd package somewhere. Dnsmasq will suit most people. If like me, the dnsmasq dns doesn&#039;t suit you, set the dnsmasq dns server to run on port 5353.</p>									</div>

					<p>By the way: on my Experimental system (release of March 28), dnsmasq (both the original version 2.20 and its update 2.22) seems to malfunction unless it&#039;s run as root. e.g., by passing it the &quot;-u root&quot; parameter or the &quot;-d&quot; option. In particular:</p><p>- /etc/ethers seems to be ignored<br />- dns forwarding doesn&#039;t work</p><p>The permissions seems to be all OK (besides, I assume that the configuration files are read, and the dhcp.leases file created, before dropping root privilege):<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# ls -l /etc/dnsmasq.conf
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root          652 Jun  1 17:17 /etc/dnsmasq.conf
root@OpenWrt:~# ls -l /etc/ethers
-rw-r--r--    1 nobody   root           63 Jun  1 16:41 /etc/ethers</code></pre></div><p>Has anyone noticed similar problems?</p><p>Enzo</p>									</div>
