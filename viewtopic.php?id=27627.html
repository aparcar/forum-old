					<p>I&#039;ve configured <strong>vblade</strong> module and published USB storage attached to my RouterStation Pro. After I&#039;ve executed <strong>aoe-discover</strong> on my Fedora and Gentoo PCs I got this drive on the list, but it shows 137GB in both cases, although it is a 320GB drive. </p><p>Found some similar issue related to LBA - 28bit addressing of diskspace in older BIOSes. But as far as I know AoE have 48bit addressing and it should do it. Also OpenWrt detects this drive as 320GB. I even compared fdisk output on remote machine and OpenWrt for this drive. OpenWrt showed 320GB space and 320GB partition on it, while remote machine said drive hase 320GB partition but cylinder count was half of OpenWrt indication.</p><p>Didn&#039;t find anything regarding this issue.... so this forum is my last hope.</p>									</div>
