					<p>I installed the package, the installation went flawlessly.&nbsp; I then performed the following commands, but I am puzzled by the results:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>wl monitor 1
ifup prism0</code></pre></div><p>I then mounted a network drive at /mnt/main/c and used the following command to start the dump:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cd /mtn/main/c
airodump prism0 test 0 1</code></pre></div><p>I then get a screen that lists the ssids of the various networks and everything looks like it is working.&nbsp; My problem is that I am only getting 3 networks, if I look my laptop it can see 10 or more.&nbsp; Also when I look at my laptop it can see my network name.&nbsp; Shouldn&#039;t my network not be visible if the router is in monitor mode?&nbsp; I am also getting a really low number of data packets and no clients, I am suspecting that something is wrong somewhere.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p><p>Thank you,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Duffin</p>									</div>
