					<p>Hi all.&nbsp; I submitted a ticket several weeks ago about sysupgrade not preserving the /etc/config directory when it upgrades the software on a UAP-Pro access point.&nbsp; (<a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/12923">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/12923</a>)&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to solve this to contribute back to OpenWRT, but I&#039;m stuck and hoping for some input.</p><p>I added a &quot;set -x&quot; to the top of /sbin/sysupgrade so I can see what&#039;s really going on.&nbsp; Here&#039;s what (I think) is the important bit:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>+ do_upgrade
