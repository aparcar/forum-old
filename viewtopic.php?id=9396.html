					<p>Browsed and searched both forum and trac to see what happened to pf_ring support since apparition until eradiction for justifictions, without getting my hands on usefull informations. The information gathered is incomplete, and I wanted to know what happened, and what were the bugs encountered to justify the complete drop of the patches, and what debugging was done from developers until drop of those patches and, support.</p><p>----------------------<br />On trac, historically:<br />----------------------<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/2266">https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/2266</a><br />10/23/05 00:03:56<br />Author: nbd<br />Message: add pf_ring patches for kernel and libpcap</p><p><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/2289">https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/2289</a><br />10/23/05 22:56:45<br />Author: nbd<br />Message: update linux 2.6 config for pf-ring</p><p><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/2292">https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/2292</a><br />10/23/05 23:13:08<br />Author: nbd<br />Message: fix 2.4 config for pf-ring</p><p><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/2801">https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/2801</a><br />01/02/06 03:38:07<br />Author: wbx<br />Message: software watchdog as kernel modul, pf ring as kernel module. saves some bytes in the default images, ideas from 22c3 talking with nbd and sven-ola<br />----------------------</p> <br /><p>-----------------<br />Tickets opened<br />-----------------<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/262">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/262</a><br />Ticket #262 (defect): pf ring broken<br />Samot reports a bug causing kernel panic when tcpdump is hard-killed.

Why was only one ticket opened on this, and the support was actually present for more than a year before removing it completely without any debugging traces, justifications of &quot;impossible support&quot;? wbx, nbd?</p><p>Thanks for any information that can be supplied!<br />N0de</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>N0de</strong> on 9 Feb 2007, 23:16)</p>
