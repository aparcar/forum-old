					<p>Unless something is massively wrong with my setup, I have noticed that something seems to be preventing the compiler from creating the squashfs-factory.bin and squashfs-sysupgrade.bin images. </p><p>I seem to be able to make it produce them if I make defconfig but at some point when I add a few packages, it ceases to produce the images though I&#039;ve not once touched the target images settings.</p><p>Then to make it worse, even when I get the images, the packages that I have supposedly added don&#039;t appear on the image, as though the image hasn&#039;t been re-compiled, updated or anything, yet the timestamps due indeed show they are updated. </p><p>This is with a TPLINK TL-WR703N, and I&#039;m compiling on Fedora 17, GCC 4.7. </p><p>Anyone having similar issues?</p><br /><p>UPDATE:<br />Nevermind, it seems I had accidentally selected a package as built-in that had dependencies that put the image size larger than the 703N will handle and something in the creation of the image aborted but apparently didn&#039;t let me know it had aborted everything I actually needed. That may also solve a problem I had earlier with &quot;files&quot; and I&#039;ll update that post if this turns out to be the case.&nbsp; That said, I would have thought the make would have aborted or at least thrown a warning that I could have found but I found nothing.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ehrichweiss</strong> on 17 Jun 2012, 08:15)</p>

					<p>Follow-up: no, it had nothing to do with the files issues. Still working on that.</p>									</div>
