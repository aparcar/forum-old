					<p>I have two Actiontec GT701-WG DSL modems with wireless access points (hooray for buying the modems and inherting from friends).&nbsp; I am working on installing OpenWRT as a &quot;just because&quot; project and to turn useless DSL modem/routers into useable access points.&nbsp; I have successfully flashed OpenWRT, but am having difficulty customizing it.&nbsp; Tips and tricks on customizing OpenWRT would be nice.&nbsp; My real question, however, is if I can customize OpenWRT my modems to be nothing more than wireless access points or do I actually need to go into the OpenWRT code and edit the physical and virtual port settings so that the installed ethernet port becomes a WAN port?</p><p>In other words: Am I in over my head and have to do some programming to create a WAN port on the RJ-45 ethernet port instead of the RJ-11 telephone cord port?</p><p>Furthermore, all the documentation that I have managed to find maintains the DSL modem functionallity.&nbsp; This is not helpful in figuring out what extras I may or may not need or reflashing OpenWRT.&nbsp; Either way, what limited documentation I have found is very helpful in getting OpenWRT onto the modem, but useless for the purposes of my project beyond the install.</p><p>By the way, I read the FAQ&#039;s and found out that I shouldn&#039;t be attempting this project since I a know nothing about Linux or SSH.&nbsp; What a GREAT way to learn - jumping in the shallow end of the pool head first.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
