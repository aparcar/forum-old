					<p>Greetings,</p><p>I am using the lovely kismet-for-windows &amp; drone-on-OpenWRT[1] combo but have some issues with the GPS coordinates.</p><p>My setup:<br />- The drone runs flawless on OpenWRT WhiteRussian RC4 [1]<br />- GPS device is the Holux 236 [bluetooth] [2]<br />- Franson GPS gate v 2.0 [source is com15, destination com1 com2 com3 &amp; com4] [3]<br />- 2 * Netstumbler with a cisco 350 &amp; the interal Broadcom [on winxp, you guessed it]<br />- kismet server &amp; client &amp; gpsd run on XP [1]</p><p>Netstumbler and anyother gps data using application are 100% happy with the output of the GPS unit [shared via Franson v 2.0] and when I check the output of the com ports with hyperterminal all seems just fine, but.</p><p>The GPS status in kismet keeps reporting: &quot;lock, 2D lock, 3D lock, no lock, lock, 2D lock, 3D..&quot; etc in about a 2 to 3 seconds frequency. </p><p>It makes NO difference if:<br />- the receiver is placed outside, inside, closer or less close. <br />- Netstumbler is closed<br />- I move fast or slow [yes, this setup runs in my car]<br />- more or less satelites are &quot;seen&quot;</p><p>Does anyone of you have a clue where to look for? Anyone seen this?</p><p>Cheers,<br />mokum</p><br /><p>[1] <a href="http://www.renderlab.net/projects/wrt54g/">http://www.renderlab.net/projects/wrt54g/</a><br />[2] <a href="http://www.holux.com/product/search.htm?filename=gpsreceiver_bluetooth_gpslim236.htm&amp;target=gpsreceiver00&amp;level=grandsonson">http://www.holux.com/product/search.htm â€¦ randsonson</a><br />[3] <a href="http://franson.com/gpsgate/">http://franson.com/gpsgate/</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, the issue has been solved.</p><p>After reading <a href="http://www.netstumbler.org/newreply.php?do=newreply&amp;p=138962">this post</a> over at the netstumbler forums I went ahead and followed goldfndr his idea:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>For anyone unable to get a 3D lock on their GPS unit that speaks only NMEA, try commenting out line 569 of libgpsd_core.c:<br />// gps_clear_fix(&amp;session-&gt;gpsdata.fix);</p></blockquote></div><p>This did the trick. Hope it helps someone who wants to run a kismet-drone on openwrt, the client, server &amp; gpsd on windows.</p><p>Cheers,<br />mokum</p>									</div>
