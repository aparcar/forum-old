					<p>Hi all</p><p>I&#039;m trying to use curl on OpenWrt to read and update a camera via its rest api.&nbsp; The camera won&#039;t do basic auth so I&#039;m trying to use digest auth.</p><p>Testing with curl on MacOS works well.&nbsp; But exactly the same command line to curl on OpenWrt returns a 401 error.</p><p>Here&#039;s the command line:<br />curl --digest -v -G -u user:password --data &quot;action=setConfig&amp;VideoWidget[0].CustomTitle[1].Text=Success&quot;&nbsp; camera_url</p><p>In verbose mode on MacOS the first response is a &quot;401 Unauthorized&quot;, after which curl prints &quot;Issue another request to this URL:&quot; and re-issues the request with a populated Authorization header.&nbsp; Request accepted; all good.</p><p>The same curl command line on OpenWrt gets the same &quot;401 Unauthorized&quot; initial response, but curl does not issue the follow-up request with an Authorization header.</p><p>I&#039;m working with curl 7.54.0 on MacOS; curl 7.40.0 on OpenWrt.</p><p>Any and all suggestions welcome!<br />Many thanks<br />Sean</p>									</div>
