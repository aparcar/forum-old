					<p>I installed OpenWRT. Then I deinstalled it again by flashing an original image on it via linux. But now, my router ofcourse boots and has his own UI back again. But the IP 192.168.1.1 is still reserved for LuCl and I can&#039;t remove this. This means, If I now try to change the IP of my router from 192.168.0.1 which leads to the TP-Link UI to 192.168.1.1 I cannot reach my router UI anymore until I do a reset <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> So this means I cannot use 192.168.1.1 anymore while it stays reserved... If I try to visit it, I get some black screen in browser with white text about LuCl. It tries to start but can&#039;t...</p><p>How to do a clean flash and complete removal of OpenWRT and leftovers from it? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Clear your web browser cache. The router isn&#039;t both running stock and OpenWrt firmware/web interface at the same time, so probably just a cache issue.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you very much! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />It was (as it seems) just like you said. It seems to be my browser cache. I deleted it and then there was no connection/loading at 192.168.1.1 anymore! Thanks! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I was so scared that I had some leftovers on my system from my change, that weren&#039;t removed. Because I had to use the firmware with &quot;boot&quot; in naming but had to remove first bits with a special command to install it, I thought maybe the boot code still was from OpenWRT now and only the UI after this was from TP-Link now. I&#039;m glad this wasn&#039;t the case and this change was complete <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Browsers tend to remember http redirection status codes (especially 301, moved permanently), which are both used by luci-ssl and many vendor firmwares, basically forever . No amount of reloading the URL, nor restarting the browser is likely to make it re-read the actually requested URL (clearing the cache might be the only option).</p>									</div>
