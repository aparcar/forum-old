					<p>Hi there,<br />First of all, sorry for my bad english.<br />I&#039;ve searched in the forum about &quot;br-lan: received packet on eth0.1 with own address as source address&quot; and found some things, but could not solve my problem.</p><p>I have more than one wireless router in my home network, one of them is using openwrt and i&#039;m using it as DHCP and DNS.<br />From time to time I&#039;m getting this &quot;br-lan: received packet on eth0.1 with own address as source address&quot; and in the same moment that router freezes (do not respond pings, dns, nothing).<br />Searching in the forum, I&#039;ve found something saying about turning off the bridge. I did it, the message doesn&#039;t appear again and the router doesn&#039;t freezes anymore. BUT... the bridge that I&#039;ve turned off is the bridge between eth0.1 (wired network) and my wireless networks.</p><p>Is there a way to stop this?<br />Or a way to not use &quot;bridge interfaces&quot; and put my wired and wireless networks together?</p><p>My router (working as AP) is a Netgear WNDR 3700 v1, with &quot;OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment 12.09 / LuCI 0.11.1 Release (0.11.1)&quot;<br />The other routers are:<br />- one Cisco RV320 working as the internet router<br />- one Netgear R6300 with original firmware, working as AP<br />- one Apple Airport Extreme, working as AP</p><p>Before I was using a VM with openwrt as the internet router, the netgear 3700 and the netgear 6300 as APs. I think the problem existed, but the netgear 3700 was being used only as AP, so I could not see the problem happening.</p><p>anyone?</p><p>Edit: Don&#039;t know if this helps, but...<br />I forgot to say that if I leave the &quot;creates a bridge over specified interface(s)&quot; checked, but only &quot;eth0.1&quot; on it, the problem continues. It only stops when I really turn off the bridge.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>digital</strong> on 16 Jan 2014, 00:55)</p>

					<p>Ok...<br />I didn&#039;t understand what this does, actually, but reading the &quot;Dumb AP&quot; in the wiki and seeing (through Microsoft Network Monitor 3.4) &quot;Igmp: IGMP membership query&quot; (source: 0.0.0.0 , dest: 224.0.0.1) I configured the /sys/devices/virtual/net/br-lan/bridge/multicast_snooping to 0.<br />The message was appearing every 2 minutes and after this change, it has not appeared yet (20 minutes).<br />LOOKS like the problem is solved, but... what I lose with multicast_snooping = 0 ?</p>									</div>
