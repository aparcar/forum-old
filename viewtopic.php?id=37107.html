					<p>Hi, after searching the forum and not finding a ready answer, I have decided to ask more knowledgeable people here.</p><p>I have a working OpenWRT setup on my router ( Backfire (10.03.x Snapshot, r31348)). I also have set up an OpenVPN client on this openwrt install. And I have installed and configured transmission as well. </p><p>Now all I need is to put the pieces together: I would like to route all the traffic from transmission through tun0 interface. Any advice how it can be done? I can make tun0 as my default route, but the overhead is too high and network speed is too low to use it for all my internet needs. As I download torrents to mounted USB flash on OpenWRT with low speed anyway, I would like these connections to go through tun0. What is an appropriate iptables/routes setup? Or is it possible to bind transmission to tun0 somehow?</p>									</div>

					<p>Unfortunately, I cannot make much out of it. While it is a useful link, iptables configuration doesn&#039;t seem to be able to route torrent traffic through specific interface correctly.</p><p>It is possible, however, to bind transmission to specific ip, but I cannot download anything if I set this IP to my tun0 IP (10.8.0.25, static lease) unless I set the default gw to be 10.8.0.25. But withiftop -i eth1 I see traffic to and from my peers (and I would like to see it routed throut tun0 interface). So, how do I make transmission use tun0, but no other interfaces?</p>									</div>

					<p>I understand what you are trying to do, mark Transmission packets so they go via the VPN TUN interface and everything else goes via the regular Internet link...</p><br /><p>Just like these guys - </p><p><a href="http://strongvpn.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=2764">http://strongvpn.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=2764</a></p><p><a href="http://strongvpn.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=610">http://strongvpn.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=610</a></p><br /><p>I&#039;m not sure if this can be applyed directly to OpenWRT, that&#039;s up to you if you would like to invest some time testing...</p><br /><p>I just spent a few moments using Google and posted the results...</p><p>Hope it helps...</p><p>Paul</p>									</div>

					<p>ok, the solution seems to be the following one: bind transmission to tun0 ip address (which is static 10.8.0.26 in my case) and configure routes properly, e.g.:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>echo &quot;1 transmission&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
ip route add 10.8.0.0/24 dev tun0 src 10.8.0.26 table transmission
ip route add default via 10.8.0.26 dev tun0 table transmission
ip rule add from 10.8.0.26/32 table transmission
ip rule add to 10.8.0.26/32 table transmission
ip route flush cache</code></pre></div><p>Courtesy to <a href="http://kindlund.wordpress.com/2007/11/19/configuring-multiple-default-routes-in-linux/">http://kindlund.wordpress.com/2007/11/1 … -in-linux/</a></p>									</div>

					<p>I am trying to do the same thing on my router, the only minor difference is that I have Attitude Adjustment 12.09.</p><p>Presently I am using openVPN in my desktop with internetprivateaccess.com. I want to move this to my openwrt router where I already have transmission setup, but no openvpn.</p><p>I tried to use the same config I use in my desktop for my router, but then all network traffic to the internet stops. Apparently it automatically change the route tables.</p><p>Also, I don&#039;t know much about ip route and ip rule. In fact I don&#039;t see these commands from the shell. I guess I don&#039;t have the right package installed for those.</p><p>Can you provide a little more detail on how to configure openvpn so can continue to have internet access while trying to hookup tranmission to openvpn? Thanks</p>									</div>

So far I&#039;ve successfully gotten openvon installed on my router and it can successfully connect to a paid vpn service that im trying right now. Currently all my traffic is going through the vpn (tun10 interface of the router. Depending on which vpn host i connect to, the TUN0 ip changes,</p><p>I have a NAS that runs my transmission client.

					<p>I have not very much knowledge that how to configure the OpenVPN connection. <br />Today it uses DHCP and auto DNS to obtain its address.<br />I plan to use a static and if I really go with static IP then what are the proper setting to it although I have chosen a best vpn service but currently not doing torrent due to highly risky situation.</p>									</div>

					<p>Correct solution requires traffic classification at its source. Not at the router.<br />Windows can set DSCP depending on process name.<br />In win7 additional registry key is required to enable this in non-domain environment.<br />At the router side set fwmark for dscp, use multiple routing tables and ip rules based on fwmark.<br />Something like here : <a href="http://forum.vyos.net/archive/index.php?thread-26148.html">http://forum.vyos.net/archive/index.php … 26148.html</a><br />but adapted for openwrt</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bolvan</strong> on 16 Mar 2016, 13:49)</p>
