					<p>There&#039;s likely a problem with your config as the interface is showing down in Luci, I had this several times in the past, although I would expect something in the logs somewhere (either dmesg or via logread). </p><p>I&#039;m not convinced that 37 is a valid channel, as it&#039;s not on wikipedia&#039;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels"> list of wlan channels</a> and doesn&#039;t show when I run <em>iw phy phy0 info</em> on my device, so I&#039;d suggest trying one of the channels that report as available in the output of that command, or in Luci.</p><p>It&#039;s also worth noting that the TP-Link devices are a bit odd in that the location in the flash (?) is set to US, which unfortunately for us means, even if we set the device to a European country, we can&#039;t get anything that isn&#039;t permitted outside of the US.<br />I&#039;m not aware of any way to change the hard-coded location, and the workarounds for the ATH9K don&#039;t work with the ATH10K. I did however manage to work around this by updating regdb.txt so that the US settings matched the GB ones and compiling from source - I&#039;m just not sure it&#039;s worth the trouble unless you specifically want something that isn&#039;t allowed by default</p>									</div>

					<p>ok, problem solved and i&#039;m making it separate post for all other technically unskilled folks like me, that will be lost like i was.</p><p>so, the main reason for my problem turned out to be picture &quot;88_272402_cf30961c13a0731.jpg&quot;, posted here:</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=233736#p233736">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 36#p233736</a></p><p>and that is floating around Internet, which claims on WDR7500V3 the pinouts on the J1 are different than WDR7500V2 - that&#039;s totally not true!! initially i connected the pins according to that picture and ended up with all those troubles i described in the above posts.</p><p>so, the pinouts of J1 on WDR7500V3 is exactly the same as on WDR7500V2:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/_detail/media/wdr7500_serial_pinout.jpg?id=toh%3Atp-link%3Atl-wdr7500">http://wiki.openwrt.org/_detail/media/w … tl-wdr7500</a></p><p>even the board look differently the easy way to identify them is &quot;C40&quot; marking on the board. the pin closest to &quot;C40&quot; is Vcc or 3.3V and from there the order is: Vcc, GND, RX, TX. i needed to connect only RX, TX and GND to get proper and normal work.</p><p>that&#039;s all about the hardware setup. </p><p>i already got &#039;u-boot&#039; access - to do that, when on the screen appears &quot;Autobooting in 1 seconds&quot;, just type &quot;tpl&quot; - at least that what was working for me.</p><p>i most likely will update here with easy steps for the firmware update via &#039;u-boot&#039;, but i will hold on for a while to get more familiar with using &#039;u-boot&#039; and available commands, i don&#039;t want to break anything. however, the most frustrating i think was the misleading J1 pinouts information.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>matura713</strong> on 23 Oct 2014, 22:53)</p>

					<p>wow that is interesting i will have to test this also. thing is so far for me the openwrt 14.07 is awesome on this router. i have not done all the speed tests but so many things are actually working now. dlna was HORRIBLE on this router before and works fantastic now. i have not seen or noticed any slowdowns yet though. in fact the transfers between systems (transferring a video) have done so MUCH better than before with the factory firmware. i used to drop connection while streaming from a laptop that does not happen now. everything just works so good except as i said i have not tested the actual speeds yet. im wondering if he enabled the ac on the 5g band as noted (im sure he did but thought it was worth asking), im very new to openwrt myself but imo even if the speeds are a slower it just works now for me. before i was ready to literally toss this thing in the trash and i can actually use it now. </p><p>being new here i do not want to get in any trouble for asking but just being curious if anyone that has tried ddwrt has seen this same result with the speeds in that thread posted? again just being curious being a former ddwrt user (just not on this router model i went straight to openwrt from factory)</p><p>as far as revision i understand between v1 and v2 but now they went and made a v3 and as per email conversations direct from them in china they seem to feel there will not be another update for the v2 (this was stated in a email before the v3 was listed on their site from a beta tech (being a beta tester) in china. i just would love to know what v3 changed from v2. i sent a email but will have to wait for the response if i find out before someone else does i will post here.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>TheDrizzle</strong> on 3 Nov 2014, 02:40)</p>

					<p>Your observation about it showing &quot;v2/v3&quot; makes sense given that the links for the latest v2 firmware and the only v3 firmware are one and the same. So while it would seem that there&#039;s definitely new hardware out there (why else a v3?), it&#039;s very unlikely that it&#039;s a fundamental difference like with v1 compared to v2.</p><p>That also bodes well for continued v2 updates, since it&#039;s tied to v3&#039;s updates. Kind of counter to what you heard, which sounded ominous, according to their support, an update to v2 is supposed to happen any time now to correct a bug surrounding (remote) web management introduced in the build from a month ago.</p>									</div>

					<p>hmm interesting. as i said im going to try to get more info from them if i can.</p><p>any idea if a new build of openwrt will be out anytime soon and will it correct the slow wifi you mentioned? i would think if it really was only half speed as shown that would be a major issue and hopefully they are working on that as i said the stock firmware sucked.</p>									</div>
