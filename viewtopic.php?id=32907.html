					<p>So title kinda gives it away...details</p><p>- I&#039;m on a WRT54G v.1.1<br />- I cannot access the web gui at 192.168.1.1 - there is a switch in the house (I live in a big place /w many other) and this address takes me to its admin panel<br />- I accidentally changed the IP address for the LAN interface to dynamic - and since I can&#039;t access the router anymore. I was able before by having the LAN cable plugged into my computer, the router into the main router for the house, and disconnecting the WIFI (and when I reconnected it, I was taken to the switch&#039;s admin panel again).<br />- I tried to restore the original factory settings doing a 30/30/30 and mysteriously it just won&#039;t work. The WIFI SSID I had setup before all this is still alive and booming, but I can&#039;t find the address that been given to my router! I basically just want to get back into it...</p><p>thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Oh yeah and other small detail...I tried to change the static IP of the switch from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.2 in the hopes of being able to access the router at 192.168.1.1, but it didn&#039;t work. It put it back to 192.168.1.1, and now none of the clients can connect to the switch anymore - there is no way to get an IP address! (dhclient fails on my computer...and I assume everyone else trying won&#039;t be able either)</p>									</div>

					<p>Hah! Well that would explain <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> <br />Is there an equivalent on openWrt? From what I can tell, people are just advised to reload the original firmware right.</p>									</div>
