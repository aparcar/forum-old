					<p>I have wr1043nd v1.8 router with Backfire (10.03.1-RC6, r28680) firmware. It works very well. Now I need some new service, so I tried to update opkg list, because download path is:</p><p><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1-rc6/ar71xx/packages/Packages.gz">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 â€¦ ackages.gz</a></p><p>But 10.03.1-rc6 doesn&#039;t exist. There is 10.03.1 directory.</p><p>Can I edit opkg.conf file with new path? Is it compatible with RC6 version firmware?</p><p>Thank&#039;s lot</p>									</div>

					<p>You are using an ancient beta version of Openwrt. 10.03.1-RC6 (1 November 2011) was a release candidate for 10.03.1, which was released on 21 December 2011.&nbsp; Even the final 10.03.1 is currrently already unsupported, as it has been superseded by 12.09 Attitude Adjustment. Backfire has mainly year 2010 code, so it is really old.</p><p>You should update to either the final Backfire 10.03.1 or much more preferably to Attitude Adjustment 12.09 and then install the new module. AA12.09 would be from 2012 and is much more modern.</p><p>The 10.03.1 packages might be compatible with your firmware, but it is not certain. You may try updating opkg.conf to point to the new directory, but there is risk that the package will brick your router.</p>									</div>
