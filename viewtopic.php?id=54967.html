					<p>Hi!</p><p>I have converted a TP-Link TL-MR3020 router and a webcam into a DIY-style IP surveillance camera. I&#039;ve managed to get mjpg-streamer working, and I can watch the stream in a browser on my PC over LAN. But the video feed is unprotected - it runs over an unencrypted HTTP, and the best that mjpg-streamer can do is basic HTTP auth.</p><p>Is there a way to better protect the camera from unauthorized access, and to prevent attackers from passively sniffing the traffic and watching the video stream? Does gstreamer have any better security?</p><p>Cya!</p>									</div>

					<p>An option that requires minimal configuration is to use SSH forwarding. Set mjpg-streamer to only listen on localhost. Enable gateway ports for dropbear (disabled by default). <strong>option GatewayPorts &#039;on&#039;</strong> in /etc/config/dropbear, or check it on System page in LuCI. Then run <strong>ssh -L 54321:localhost:8080 &lt;router address&gt;</strong> on your own computer, replacing 8080 with the port mjpg-streamer listens on. Browse to http://localhost:54321, and watch the feed encrypted through the SSH connection.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the suggestion.</p><p>I was originally thinking of using a nginx reverse proxy to wrap the mjpg-streamer http output in a TLS session with an appropriate x.509 certificate. Does this method of yours also work for non-http streams like RTSP? UDP Multicast?</p>									</div>
