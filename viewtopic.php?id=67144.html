					<p>Hi everybody.</p><p>I&#039;m trying to build openwrt with official tutorial, but there are some problems:</p><ul><li><p>DSL will not work in any way. I don&#039;t care about dsl.</p></li><li><p>No official support. There is a BCM63xx code in kernel, but there is no correct target for linksys x3000.</p></li></ul><p>There is no problem to build something (bcm63xx, generic, generic produces a lot of images), but there is a problem to don&#039;t kill the device.</p><p>The switch BCM53125 seems to be supported too.</p><p>So, questions:<br /></p><ul><li><p>Can I use any of produced images?<br />For example, this page Broadcom page on WikiDev website says that Motorola NVG510, Sagemcom F@ST 2504n and TP-LINK TD-W8970 v3 have the same BCM63xx SoC. And 2 of 3 are supported by openwrt! (except motorola)</p></li><li><p>If i can&#039;t, can anybody help me to produce a correct target for X3000 and build the image?<br />(I can change code, build, test it on my device and that fix wiki and send pull request if needed)</p></li><li><p>What about fails? Will it be possible to restore factory via UART (of course if boot loader alive) ?</p></li><li><p>Does anybody know success stories for this device? Or why it&#039;s not possible?</p></li><li><p>What is correct way to upload an image? Via std gui or uart ?</p></li></ul><p>PS: I used trunc version of sources to produce images.<br />PPS: I&#039;m a developer, but newbe in openwrt.</p><p>In anyway, thanks for your attention!</p>									</div>
