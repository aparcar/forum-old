					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to turn my WRT54G into a (modest) VPN server for a Windows XP box to connect to it. Every connection attempt fails with the &quot;error 737 - loopback detected&quot; message.</p><p>This was an issue well known by l2tpd developers (see for example [1] and [2]). In theory, this had been fixed by a patch coded by Damion de Soto, which is integrated in l2tpd-0.70pre-4. However, I keep running into this error when running it on my WRT54G. I have also tried using the Debian Project&#039;s sources and patch to build my own l2tpd package with the White Russian SDK with no more luck.</p><p>I have also tried the <em>connect-delay</em> workaround described in [3]. This barely changed things, making maybe one out of ten connection attempts successful, then requiring a reboot to get a new one again.</p><p>What makes me so persistent is that I can connect the same client, in the same network, using the exact same version and configuration of l2tpd, on a Pentium II box.</p><p>Has anybody managed to turn their router into a VPN server for NT clients that way, or instead run into this problem ?</p><br /><p>[1] <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/l2tpd-devel@l2tpd.org/msg00300.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/l2tpd-devel … 00300.html</a><br />[2] <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/l2tpd-devel@l2tpd.org/msg00314.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/l2tpd-devel … 00314.html</a><br />[3] <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/l2tpd-devel@l2tpd.org/msg00300.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/l2tpd-devel … 00300.html</a></p>									</div>
