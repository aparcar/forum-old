					<p>Using TP-Link TL-WR1043N/ND v2 on Barrier Breaker 14.07-rc3 / LuCI Trunk (svn-r10467), Kernel Version 3.10.49.</p><p>Previously, was using DD-WRT on Buffalo WHR-HP-G300N and stock firmware on D-Link 615, 1 AP each, attached over wire to a single router (from the ISP) and DLNA was working fine using Android wifi clients running BubbleUPNP accessing media on my 2 NAS (a DLink DNS-320 and a Thecus) and a Win7 laptop. The android clients were able to watch videos on the 2 NAS over DLNA, as well as file-browse the 2 NAS using ES File Explorer on Android, and of course detect the Win7 laptop over DLNA.</p><p>Then I bought 2 newer TP-Links and installed OpenWRT on them. I duplicated the network settings replacing the Buffalo and D-Link with the 2 TP-Links. Now my android clients cannot detect/find my DLNA servers, so need advice/help on what I can do.</p><p>I&#039;ve disabled multicast snooping by doing:</p><p>echo &quot;0&quot; &gt; /sys/devices/virtual/net/br-lan/bridge/multicast_snooping</p><p>as well as install avahi-daemon and enabled/started it, but I suspect I didn&#039;t need to do that. I&#039;ve also removed firewall profiles from the br-lan interface.</p><p>After disabling multicast_snooping I am now able to see the Win7 laptop, but not the 2 NAS.</p><p>I received a miracast dongle together with my TP-Link routers, and my android client is able to detect the miracast dongle and communicate with it over the network, and BubbleUPNP can see the miracast device to &quot;cast&quot; media over. Problem now is my android device cannot detect my DLNA servers to cast media over to the miracast device, nor watch video via DLNA on my android devices. I can still use ES File Explorer to browse into the file server and open up the video files to watch though, just not via DLNA/BubbleUPNP.</p>									</div>

					<p>Simplest solution I used:<br />1. Login to your router<br />2. Go to System -&gt; Software<br />3. Go to available packages<br />4. (optional) Search for UPNP <br />5. Install luci-app-upnp, this will also install miniupnpd</p><p>Then DLNA/UPNP traffic should work over the network. I hope this answers your question.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>j0bb13</strong> on 30 Sep 2014, 17:07)</p>
