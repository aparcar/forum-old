					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am trying to run the open-source Knopflerfish OSGi-Framework on my Asus WL-500d Deluxe router running OpenWRT White Russian RC5.</p><p>I installed SableVM, and tested both 1.13 from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backports/rc5/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backports/rc5/</a> and 1.11 from <a href="http://openwrt.poulpy.org">http://openwrt.poulpy.org</a>/ with the same results. I can run simple Java programs wihtout problems, but when I run Knopflerfish it crashes after a few minutes. Sometimes I get a Segmentation Fault, sometimes it just gets back to the shell. I increased verbosity of SableVM and Knopflerfish, but I still get no error message before or after the crash.</p><p>Does anyone have similar problems or know how to circumvent this?</p><p>At the beginning I thought my device didn&#039;t have enough memory, so I created a 128MB Swap-file on a USB-Stick, but it didn&#039;t help.</p><p>I also tried JamVM (from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/people/nbd/ar7/packages/)">http://downloads.openwrt.org/people/nbd/ar7/packages/)</a> but it just gives me a Segmentation Fault, even if I run it without parameters.</p><p>Anyone got Blackdown or Kaffe VM running on their routers? Or any other Java VM?</p><p>Thanks in advance<br />Leonardo.</p>									</div>

As long you have enough memory, any Java program should run on the router. Swapping will make everything slower, but it should still work.</p><p>I suppose there is a problem with threads in SableVM. I found the following bug report:</p><p><a href="http://sablevm.org/lists/sablevm-bugs/2006-January/000789.html">http://sablevm.org/lists/sablevm-bugs/2 … 00789.html</a></p><p>According to the SableVM documentation there are &quot;3 flavors of threaded interpretation (switched, threaded and inlined)&quot;, so maybe compiling SableVM with a different kind of thread interpretation could solve the problem.</p><p>Regards<br />Leonardo.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi all,</p><p>humaita reports an error (&quot;java/lang/NoClassDefFoundError:java/lang/Thread&quot;) that occurred when using JamVM. This error message occurred because the JamVM does not work with the sablevm-classpath package. That is an error in the dependency of the JamVM package. I will fill out a ticket to report this problem&nbsp; to the openWRT developers as soon as possible. <br />To use JamVM you need the original CLASSPATH from <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/">http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/</a>. </p><p>Dex</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I would just like to tell you guys that the OSGi Framework from Knopflerfish works using JamVM. When I run the fullblown Knopflerfish OSGi Framework with all default bundles, which are designed for a big and heavy desktop PC, the Router still has 1MB (of 32MB) free RAM. The memory footprint of a minimal OSGi Framework is about 4MB, leaving about 9MB free RAM.</p><p>The problems I had with JamVM were mostly because I installed classpath on a usb stick. The classpath libs were on /mnt/disc0_1/usr/lib - since busybox doesn&#039;t have ldconfig and the ipkg installer couldn&#039;t symlink because of the FAT filesystem on the stick it didn&#039;t work. As a workaround I copied the libs to /tmp and linked them to the /lib. After that I could start java programs by running</p><p>jamvm -Xbootclasspath/a:&quot;/mnt/disc0_1/usr/local/classpath/share/classpath/glibj.zip&quot; [CLASSNAME]</p><p>I did not manage to solve the problems with sableVM. I tried compiling it myself with other thread interpretations but I still got the same problems.</p><p>Regards,<br />Leonardo.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Since Bamboo is written in Java, is it easy to port Bamboo into wireless access router, e.g. OpenWRT which mostly written in C/C++? Why? How about some other DHT algorithms, e.g. CAN or Chord implementations?</p><p>Thank you very much!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I suppose you mean <a href="http://bamboo-dht.org">http://bamboo-dht.org</a>/, right?</p><p>Since Bamboo already runs on Linux - and OpenWRT is an embedded Linux distribution - it should not be very hard. And as you can see from my post OpenWRT also has a working Java VM.</p><p>Why don&#039;t you try to cross-compile following this guide:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/BuildingPackagesHowTo">http://wiki.openwrt.org/BuildingPackagesHowTo</a></p><p>Regards<br />Leonardo.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I mean <a href="http://bamboo-dht.org">http://bamboo-dht.org</a>.&nbsp; Are there a lot of coding work to do in the porting? Do you have any use case examples?

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am not a developer. It could be you can just compile the source code without any modifications, so you would not need to do any coding. It could also be you need to change a lot so the code compiles. Cant&#039; tell.</p><p>I would just download the OpenWRT-SDK and try to compile the software.</p><p>You can find the source-code of current ports (including patches where needed) here:</p><p><a href="http://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/branches/whiterussian/openwrt/package/">http://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/branches … t/package/</a></p><p>Regards<br />Leonardo.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Leonardo,</p><p>Thanks for your reply. </p><p>Since it is ported from Java to C/C++, there might be memory resource used up when running Bamboo. Running Bamboo requires more RAM, probably requires libraries and features that Java VM does not provide...</p>									</div>
