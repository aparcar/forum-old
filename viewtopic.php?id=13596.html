					<p>I have a remote wireless repeating station that has a UPS. I would like to use NUT on a WL-500gP running Kamikaze to monitor the UPS.</p><p>I have done many searches and I have found some references that there are people that have successfully run NUT on OpenWRT. However, I cannot find any NUT packages for Kamikaze. I took a look in the subversion repository and did not find any nut packages there either.</p><p>So before I go off and start the porting process I have two questions.</p><p>1)&nbsp; Does any one know where I could find a NUT package ported for OpenWRT?</p><p>2)&nbsp; Am I chasing the wrong utility, Is there a different tool ported to OpenWRT that could be used to to monitor a UPS?</p><br /><p>Thanks</p><p>Darren</p>									</div>
