					<p>I am trying to connect to an external IPSec VPN endpoint from a host connected to the LAN side of my router.&nbsp; I have the ports 500 (tcp/udp) and 4500 (udp) open as per the requirements as well as &#039;esp&#039; and &#039;ah&#039; protocols. I had this working very reliably with the stock firmware but never since I installed OpenWrt.</p><p>I am running DD (r48135) and have struggled for weeks (months?) trying to get IPSec passthrough working.</p><p>I&#039;ve found bits and pieces of information here and there on the wiki and private blogs but none of them appear to have a complete solution. Does anybody have a basic HOWTO for a newb?</p>									</div>
