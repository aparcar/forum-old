					<p>Ebay search for &quot;jtag cable linksys&quot; gave at least one hit.</p><p>For your board look at the front edge for a 2x6 block, it will be fairly obvious 12-pin location. They will either have open holes or be filled with solder.&nbsp; For solder removal I clamp board upright and put solder-sucker in one hand against a hole from one side.&nbsp; Then touch the point of the iron to the same point from other side.&nbsp; Hit the trigger on the solder-remover and POP all the solder goes into the vacuum and you have a nice clean hole.&nbsp; Repeat 11 more time and it&#039;s ready for a header.</p><p>Takes me less than 5 minutes now.</p>									</div>

					<p>You can ssh to the router (192.168.1.1) and then use the &#039;nvram set boot_wait=on&#039; command followed by &#039;nvram commit&#039;.&nbsp; I&#039;d recommend checking it first with &#039;nvram show&#039;.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well Kamikaze may not use it very much, but the bootloader does.&nbsp; It is CFE that checks boot_wait.&nbsp; This is easier to see with serial console.&nbsp; Also from console you can just interrupt boot, and put it into wait mode for TFTP with a few commands.</p>									</div>
