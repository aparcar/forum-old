					<p>Hi to all, </p><p>I know OpenWrt is a project not based on broadcom wl driver, but I think this could be important (if true, obviously) and I&#039;ll appreciate the impressions of the OpenWrt developers</p><p>looking on the net I found this product <br /><a href="http://www.usr.com/support/product-template.asp?prod=5461">http://www.usr.com/support/product-temp â€¦ ?prod=5461</a> </p><p>As OpenWrt table of hardware says, this router is based on Broadcom 5350 (most similar to 5352 of WRTG(S) I think). On the usr website I found that with the last firmware realase what they called &quot;MaxG mode&quot; (our Afterburner I think) is finally supported in wds mode! </p><p>I downloaded the source from usr gpl code central(http://www.usr.com/support/s-gpl-code.asp, model xx5461) and I found that wl binaries are more recent than Linksys (10/2005). </p><p>Unlucly I&#039;m trying but I&#039;m unable to build a firmware image from linksys original adding the new wl drivers (I&#039;m no too linux skilled&nbsp; ) </p><p>Can somebody see if it&#039;s possible to use these new drivers in order to verify if it&#039;s true that afterburner works in wds mode? </p><p>Assuming that I&#039;ve a buildable source (the linksys original), what do I modify if I want, as in this case, refresh firmware with new drivers? </p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>I tried with the linksys firmware, simply replacing wl folder but it doesn&#039;t work (error compiling firmware).... so I think that I&#039;ll obtain the same result with OpenWrt...</p><p>What I must do, replace the wl.o and compile the firmware (in this case OpenWrt) or replace the wl.o in /lib/module/etcetc?</p><p>I tried the first case and I obtain error compiling the firmware, in the second case the wl.o was &#039;locked&#039; and I&#039;m unable to replace... please, can you give me some help or howto?</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br />FunMan</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve had a look at the driver now. It&#039;s much newer than the Linksys version and also incompatible with that system code.<br />So while we won&#039;t support it in White Russian, an only slightly older version of that driver is already integrated in Kamikaze.<br />You should probably wait until it&#039;s a bit more stable before trying it...</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, I&#039;ll wait.... </p><p>You said the driver is incompatible with linksys code... it&#039;s much different indeed?&nbsp; Kamikaze uses a older version of this driver so with Kamizake will be sufficient to replace the driver and compile it?</p><p>FunMan</p>									</div>

					<p>I was just looking into this issue. I&#039;m running whiterussian, using non-lazy WDS to link two WRT54GS. wl0_gmode is set to 6 by default. The link is working, but it&#039;s slower than I hoped. Should I be using some other value here to get better results? </p><p>Thanks,<br />chris</p>									</div>
