					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I have a big problem with my linksys WRT54-GS running RC09, when it&#039;s WAN is connected to a local network with traffic about 15-20Mbits (not directed to the router). It seems that WAN is always running in promiscuous mode and this cause ksoftirqd_CPU0 process to take most of the CPU (50-80%). The other side effects are high packet loss on the other ports, connection dropping, router hangs and restarts. I tried to switch off the promiscuous mode on eth0, but it didn&#039;t help - it seems the PROMISC flag doesn&#039;t have any effect.</p><p>Any help will be appreciated.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Nasko</p>									</div>
