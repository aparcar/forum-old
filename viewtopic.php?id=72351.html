					<p>You need to install some more packages ... there is a great tool available for this already. It&#039;s called &quot;lockdown.sh&quot;, it will install all the necessary packages and set up the environment for iphone tethering. It can be found here hxxps://github.com/LeJeko/OpenWRT-USB-Tethering. you may want to change line 200 and 207 to eth2 instead of eth1. many routers already have eth1 present in which case the interface will not be added, using eth2 instead will avoid this conflict. I mentioned it to the other but it has yet to be changed in the source</p><p>line 200<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>if [ -z &quot;`cat /etc/config/network | grep eth1`&quot; ];then

change to 

if [ -z &quot;`cat /etc/config/network | grep eth2`&quot; ];then</code></pre></div><p>line 207<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>uci set network.usb.ifname=&#039;eth1 usb0&#039;

change to

uci set network.usb.ifname=&#039;eth2 usb0&#039;</code></pre></div><p>another note is that you may run out of space on a 4mb router, you may squeeze it in if you compile the necessary packages into the image rather then adding them in after.</p><p>Hostle</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, so </p><p>1.I installed the openwrt-CC-USB_tethering_v5.1-tl-mr3020-v1-squashfs-factory.bin firmware (overwriting current config) from hxxps://github.com/LeJeko/OpenWRT-USB-Tethering/releases/tag/v5.1<br />2. rebooted<br />3. connected ethernet to my computer, got assigned an IP address<br />4. turned off tethering, connected phone to USB on router, trusted computer, turned on tethering (USB only) and blue bar turned on iPhone showing a connection<br />5. I logged into router and saw both TX and RX traffic to phone</p><p>My issue:<br />When I ping say cnn.com, and the IP address gets resolved but I requests time out and I get a 100% packet lost.&nbsp; I can&#039;t browse any sites on my computer (even if I override DNS to 8.8.8.8)</p><p>I get the same behavior if I SSH and try the ping from the router.</p><p>Any ideas?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>juan9999</strong> on 21 Oct 2017, 14:08)</p>
