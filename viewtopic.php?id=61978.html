					<p>Hi :-)</p><p>I&#039;m trying to understand the WRT54GL internal structure, using experiments with the WRT54GL/Backfire (10.03.1, r29592), as well as this famous diagram :</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://wiki.openwrt.org/_media/media/linksys/wrt54/wrt54_internal_architecture.png" alt="PunBB bbcode test" /></span></p><p>This diagram shows a default setting, with vlan0 on case-labeled ports 1234.<br />In case of a more complex setting, vlan-wise, I guess the picture should look different.<br />What does happen really ?</p><p>I guess a change in vlan settings isn&#039;t sent to the Switch part.<br />So the only solution I can think of is :<br />. the 5 switch ports are hard-coded tagged, whatever the vlan settings, with a tag corresponding to the physical port ( physical port 4 = vlan0, physical port 3 = vlan1, physical port 2 = vlan 2, ... )<br />. they are sent through the Internal port tagged,<br />. they are received by the CPU, and put in 5 different stacks, one per received tag<br />. the software then proceeds, using the user&#039;s vlan settings : it checks the port user&#039;s vlan, and proceeds to the associated interface, adding a tag in case of tagged port, keeping the packet tagless in case of untagged port.</p><p>Is this what is really happening ?</p><p>Thanks for any help :-)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ZenNetwork</strong> on 5 Jan 2016, 20:54)</p>
