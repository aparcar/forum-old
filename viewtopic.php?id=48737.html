Everthing was going nice.<br />I was saving some firewall/port forwarding rule when the router crash. I was on LuCI.</p><p>I cant get acces with browser on the 192.168.1.1 or with the failsafe mode (the sys led is flishing very fast, so the router is in failsafe mode), and telnet 192.168.1.1 answer in few seconds after trying to connect: &quot;Could not open connection to the host, on port 23: Connect failed&quot;.<br />The IP PC network is set manually in 192.168.1.2 and the subnet mask 255.255.255.0</p><p>I dont know what to do now. Its this fixable or i have a big white paperweight?</p><p>Thnks and sorry for my imperfect english!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>aalgorta</strong> on 2 Feb 2014, 19:40)</p>
