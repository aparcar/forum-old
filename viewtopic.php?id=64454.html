					<p>MacOS fs is not case sensitive.

					<p>You need create case-sensitive disk image dedicate to OpenWrt source code. see: <a href="https://source.android.com/source/initializing.html#setting-up-a-mac-os-x-build-environment">https://source.android.com/source/initi … nvironment</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks guys for the replies. I was able to move forward with creating a case-sensitive disk image.
