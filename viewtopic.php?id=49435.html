					<p>I&#039;m trying to setup a home surveillance device by using TPLINK TL-MR3020 router with the latest openwrt BB trunk, and a Logitech Quickcam pro 9000. I&#039;ve already setup openwrt with appropriate kmods, mjpeg streamer, network config, and the like. Having the USB webcam attached, I can run mjpeg_streamer manually over a serial connection, and see the video feed on my main PC in a browser.</p><p>However I&#039;d like the openwrt video stream to initiate automatically upon boot. So I edited the /etc/config/mjpg-streamer file like this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config mjpg-streamer &#039;core&#039;
        option enabled &#039;1&#039;
        option input &#039;uvc&#039;
        option output &#039;http&#039;
        option device &#039;/dev/video0&#039;
        option resolution &#039;960x720&#039;
        option fps &#039;10&#039;
        option www &#039;/www/stream&#039;
        #option yuv &#039;1&#039;
        #option quality &#039;30&#039;
        option port &#039;80&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Unfortunately there&#039;s a problem with this setup because the streamer application attempts to start streaming even before the camera driver loads, and therefore fails. Here is a portion of the boot log that says it all.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>[&nbsp; &nbsp; 6.890000] eth0: link down<br />procd: - early -<br />procd: - watchdog -<br /><strong>/etc/init.d/mjpg-streamer: device &#039;/dev/video0&#039; does not exist</strong><br />Failed to connect to ubus<br />procd: - ubus -<br />procd: - init -<br />Please press Enter to activate this console.<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 9.100000] Linux video capture interface: v2.00<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 9.120000] uvcvideo: Found UVC 1.00 device &lt;unnamed&gt; (046d:0990)<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 9.150000] input: UVC Camera (046d:0990) as /devices/platform/ehci-platform/usb1/1-1/1-1:1.0/input/input0<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 9.150000] usbcore: registered new interface driver uvcvideo<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 9.160000] USB Video Class driver (1.1.1)<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 9.170000] nf_conntrack version 0.5.0 (451 buckets, 1804 max)<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 9.240000] xt_time: kernel timezone is -0000<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 9.250000] ip_tables: (C) 2000-2006 Netfilter Core Team<br />procd: - init complete -<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;16.190000] eth0: link up (100Mbps/Full duplex)<br />procd: Instance odhcpd::instance1 s in a crash loop 6 crashes, 0 seconds since last crash</p></blockquote></div><p>Is there a way to delay the launch of mjpg_streamer until after the /dev/video0 device has appeared? Also my odhcpd is crashing for some reason.</p><p>Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Fragment</strong> on 12 Mar 2014, 20:40)</p>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I can advise you to edit the <strong>/etc/init.d/mjpg-streamer</strong> and change the boot priority:</p><p>ex: <strong>START=99</strong></p><p>Check in the web interface the <strong>System -&gt; Startup</strong> menu and see which is the last possible number...</p><p>If this still not working after you change the priority, i think you can had the <strong>sleep</strong> command to script:</p><p>Ex: <strong>sleep 60</strong> (1 min)</p><p>This way you can delay the execution of the command.</p><p>See ya...</p>									</div>

					<p>The START=99 method does not work. I&#039;ve tried modifying some other things i.e. setting the module load order for the camera driver in /etc/modules.d/ down to &quot;66-video-uvc&quot;, but that didn&#039;t work either. There is no web interface in BB trunk by default. Is there a way to fix this possibly without resorting to the sleep trick?</p><p>P.S. what process is responsible for starting mjpg_streamer? There don&#039;t seem to be any startup files like S90mjpg_streamer in /etc/rc.d/</p><p><strong>EDIT: Solved it.</strong><br />The mjpg streamer was being loaded by hotplug.<br />I had to disable it by deleting the file /etc/hotplug.d/usb/90-mjpg-streamer<br />After that I created a new startup file by placing a symlink for /etc/init.d/mjpg_streamer inside /etc/rc.d folder<br />After a reboot everything worked fine.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Fragment</strong> on 12 Mar 2014, 20:39)</p>
