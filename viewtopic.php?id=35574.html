					<p>I have created a small android program that can query an openwrt router, retrieve a list of connected clients, and present the data in a somewhat useful way.&nbsp; This is really my first android project, and, even worse still, my first Java program.</p><p>The android package can be downloaded from <a href="https://raw.github.com/flyer-explorer/OpenWRT-Client-List/master/bin/OpenWRTClients-release.apk">here</a>.&nbsp; </p><p>Instructions:<br />- Install the apk on your phone.

					<p>Nice work with this, thanks for sharing it! I&#039;m in the process of testing it out and have the following notes in order to get it working:</p><p>1. The files downloaded are named &quot;serve-lease&quot; but command for creating the init script sym link says &quot;server-lease.&quot; To fix this either update the &quot;ln&quot; command from:<br />ln -sf ../init.d/server-leases S99server-leases to:<br />ln -sf ../init.d/serve-leases S99serve-leases<br />or you can rename the files and code to all use the work &quot;server&quot; if you prefer.</p><p>2. The quotations are messed up on code for creating the config file. The last three lines have it at the end when it goes after the txt to echo as in line one.</p><p>3. The init script and /usr/bin script need to be allowed to be executed by running chmod as follows: (I know you know this but it wasn&#039;t included in the list.)&nbsp; :-)</p><p>chmod u+x /etc/init.d/serve-leases<br />chmod u+x /usr/bin/serve-leases.sh</p><p>4. Lastly the stop script kills netcat which could be an issue if it&#039;s also running for other reasons. Maybe best to create and check for a pid file?</p><p>All in all nice work and thanks again. I like the simplicity and I&#039;m sure this could easily be extended to show other info such as current bandwidth usage, the number of total tcp connections, etc..</p>									</div>
