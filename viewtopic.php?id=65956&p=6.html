					<p>I doubt that my patches will ever get merged into LEDE. I don&#039;t know why, but there seems to be bias against me personally or something in the patch set that the project maintainers don&#039;t want to directly address.</p><p>Alternatively, the project is just so dysfunctional that they are incapable of working with me.</p><p>I don&#039;t know WTF the problem is.</p><p>Nearly all of the communications from LEDE team members have been passive-aggressive and petty. Mathias Kresin in particular seems upset that I touched his stapler or something.</p><p>The first point of contention came with the preinit script to fix up the ethernet MAC addresses. The argument against allowing this was nonsensical and no better alternative was suggested. It&#039;s hard to take this objection seriously since this is already supported by a number of other devices, and this is exactly the kind of thing that preinit is for.</p><p>When that argument fell flat, Mathias moved on to questioning the Build/cameo-sig target, which appends the byte-aligned signature to the factory image. His argument was that he was unable to comprehend a 13-line makefile that used variable declarations, parameter expansion, and 5th grade arithmetic. He&#039;s either incredibly stupid, or just fucking with me for giggles. Maybe both. Again his arguments were so nonsensical that I&#039;m convinced he either wasn&#039;t reading the code or just doing this on purpose.</p><p>His arguments against the Cameo-sig portion is particularly unbelievable because mailing list history shows he&#039;s reviewed devices and code that work with them before. I think he&#039;s just fucking with me to pad his ego or something.... or he really is just stupid and doesn&#039;t remember his own prior work. Whatever.</p><p>So I wrote a mail to the lede-adm mailing list asking them to contact me so that we could work this out. I don&#039;t what my first course of action to be making an ugly scene of the mailing list, so I figure I&#039;ll work it out quietly. Maybe I&#039;m doing something wrong that they have not made clear.</p><p>But no, instead of replying to my email directly (I received no private reply), someone else on the LEDE Dev team starts going after something entirely new that wasn&#039;t an issue before. Five revisions in, they suddenly decide that the ITS-maker script I wrote to produce the FIT image is a problem, and they don&#039;t want it!</p><p>I don&#039;t know WTF their problem is but I give up.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jmomo</strong> on 15 Dec 2016, 03:02)</p>

					<p>jmomo, just wanted to chime in here and say thanks for all the hard work. Not going to comment on the mail list exchanges directly as there&#039;s no point (did read through a few of them out of curiosity though), but do want to say that it seems sad that there&#039;s not more effort from the project&#039;s side to help bring new hardware into the support fold. My general understanding was that individual targets were supported by devs or contributors anyway, not necessarily the main project people, so why code like yours couldn&#039;t be added and just marked as &quot;experimental&quot; or &quot;maintained sole by&quot; is strange to me... it&#039;s not like you&#039;ve violated international law and caused the build system to create a nuclear weapon or something...<br />Anyway, thanks for your hard work!</p>									</div>

					<p>I must admin I gave up. Everything looks promising however network reliability is not in par with OEM firmware. Made two tests (via copper):<br />- With DNS queries (Internet server) where every 3-4 query gets response in 10x longer time.<br />- Similar hiccups with voice. Skype connection quality is deteriorating from time to time.<br />After returning to stock firmware network works better. So for me thank you but no.</p><p>PS. In syslog there are repeating following messages.
