					<p>Hello all, </p><p>I&#039;m having issues installing both the trunk and 15.05 firmware of my WR710N.&nbsp; The TP-Link webUI throws the following error when I select the firmware: &quot;Error 18005 (Upgrade unsuccessfully because the version of the upgraded file was incorrect. Please check the file name.)&quot; I have the USA version (v1) of the device and am on the latest official firmware (TL-WR710N_V1_151022_US). </p><p>Is there an easy way to resolve this issue? I tried downgrading the firmware and am getting the same issue. Is there any other firmware I could try? DD-WRT was able to resolve this issue by modifying the the US header here: <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=179414&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=195&amp;sid=5b9117172715975e95aa31d6f08418ab">http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic. â€¦ d6f08418ab</a> .&nbsp; </p><p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>xeem</strong> on 20 Jan 2016, 16:37)</p>
