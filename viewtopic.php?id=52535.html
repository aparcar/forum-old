					<p>Hi all. I have a certain network in mind, but the hardware my ISP gave me is giving me trouble, and I&#039;m wondering whether there is some solution for it using OpenWRT&#039;s many many functions. I have only very basic knowledge of networking, so most things I read are over my head. That&#039;s why I came here.</p><p>I recently rewired my whole home network because we upgraded to this new ISP. I have installed OpenWRT (barrier breaker) on my TL-WDR3600 router, which is working great. Let&#039;s call this &quot;Main Router&quot;. From the ISP we got a Modem and another router (Let&#039;s call it &quot;Sub Router&quot;), 2 seperate devices. Here is my setup in mind (all wired through ethernet cables):</p><p>Modem -&gt; Main Router<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&gt; IP Phone<br />Main Router -&gt; Sub Router (which is 50m away)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&gt; PC 1 (Home Media Server)<br />Sub Router&nbsp; -&gt; PC 2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&gt; IPTV</p><p>The problem lies with mr. Sub Router. The ISP has locked down the device so it can only perform a few functions. All LAN ports are pre-configured and I can&#039;t change it: LAN 1-3 is for normal internet using VLAN 500, while LAN 4 is for IPTV using VLAN 600. Furthermore, it can only support PPPoE for the WAN connection (5th port, beside the 4 LAN ports). And I believe only the WAN port can act as the uplink port.<br />What I want to know is, can OpenWRT on my Main Router be configured in some way that it can deal with the PPPoE connection? Maybe let it act as if it is the PPP server?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Djalaal</strong> on 2 Sep 2014, 08:17)</p>
