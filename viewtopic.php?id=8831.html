					<p>Happy New Year to all,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In celebration, I decided to upgrade firmwares on an old WRT54G (v1.1).&nbsp; My goal was to setup free wifi for neighbors through something like Chillispot and seperate VLANs for my LAN traffic and their Wifi.&nbsp; I found what *appeared* to be a great page for this, but without the understanding of nvram settings on the WRT that I should have had, I soon followed the instructions to a semi-bricked router.&nbsp; Here&#039;s where it all went to Hell:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>nvram set wan_ifname=vlan1
nvram set wan_proto=static
nvram set wan_ipaddr=192.168.1.1
nvram set wan_netmask=255.255.255.0
nvram set wan_gateway=192.168.1.1
nvram set wan_dns=192.168.1.1
ipkg update
ipkg install kmod-tun
ipkg install chillispot
nvram set lan_ifnames=&quot;vlan0 eth3&quot;
nvram commit
/etc/init.d/S40network restart</code></pre></div><p>It was the last nvram set where the instructions use &quot;eth3&quot; that I got worried.&nbsp; What is eth3?&nbsp; As I understand, eth0 is the 4-port switch and eth1 is the wireless.&nbsp; The article says that it was to seperate wireless and the wired LAN ports (which I want to do), but is that the proper way?</p><p>Anyway, my feelings of unease were intensified when I issued the last command and the SSH session cut out.&nbsp; (No biggie!&nbsp; It&#039;s coming back, right?&nbsp; RIGHT?&nbsp; Wrong.)&nbsp; Rebooting has no effect.&nbsp; Looking at the LEDs, it appears that OpenWRT is booting just fine (DMZ light comes on after a while, then shuts off) and I can still ping it at 192.168.1.1 for a brief while.&nbsp; Additionally, I can see the notification for failsafe mode when I use the reboot the router and use :<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>tcpdump -i eth0 -nX -s100 udp port 4919</code></pre></div><p>I&#039;ve successfully used failsafe mode under RC5, but I can&#039;t seem to trigger it under RC6.&nbsp; Usually, I&#039;ll immediately press the reset button as soon as I get the notice through tcpdump.&nbsp; This will cause another notice informing me that failsafe mode is being run.&nbsp; However, I get no such luck with repeated attempts.</p><p>All of that setup to ask these questions:</p><p>1)&nbsp; Just what in the hell did that last nvram set command do?<br />2)&nbsp; Is there a way for me to use the running OpenWRT session (now that wireless has been segregated)?<br />3)&nbsp; Why isn&#039;t failsafe mode working like I thought it did?<br />4)&nbsp; Once nvram settings have been carelessly altered is there a way to revert them back to defaults (NOT WIPE)!</p><p>Thanks in advance and best wishes for the new year!</p><p>-- Aaron</p><p>P.S.&nbsp; If, after that horror story, you still want the article, it&#039;s at HowtoForge <a href="http://www.howtoforge.com/wireless_hotspot_howto">http://www.howtoforge.com/wireless_hotspot_howto</a></p>									</div>

					<p>1. It shouldn&#039;t have done anything other than removing wifi from the bridge... looking at RC6 /sbin/ifup script source, invalid interface names there shouldn&#039;t break anything. But obviously something changed if it doesn&#039;t work anymore.</p><p>Here&#039;s some nvram settings from a working WRT54GS v1.1 router:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># nvram show|grep lan_ifname
size: 8687 bytes (24081 left)
lan_ifnames=vlan0 eth1 eth2 eth3
lan_ifname=br0
# ifconfig eth3
ifconfig: eth3: error fetching interface information: Device not found
# ifconfig eth2
ifconfig: eth2: error fetching interface information: Device not found</code></pre></div><p>4. According to wiki ( <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WRT54G">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har â€¦ sys/WRT54G</a> ): &quot;Resetting to factory defaults via reset button or mtd erase nvram is not safe on this unit.&quot;. Since that&#039;s not possible you also could use JTAG or serial (if it works) and manually change the settings back.</p><p>If you have another linksys router available, a relatively easy way to get serial console is to cross connect another router&#039;s serial with the one being debugged. You only need to cross wire the Rx and Tx pins with a resistor between (I used 10kohm resistors). This saves you from the need of voltage level conversion which is required if you connect the router to a PC. After this you have access to serial console which helps debugging the problem. In my opinion, this was easier than it sounds - even I managed to do that with my zero soldering skills ;)</p><p>First I would go and reflash using tftp (you do have boot_wait enabled, don&#039;t you?). It is possible that you have a firewall problem since you get see the UDP broadcast packet.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>keitsi</strong> on 2 Jan 2007, 03:29)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the quick response keitsi,</p><p>Well, since my first post, I&#039;ve been toying around with it.&nbsp; I know that it is up and running (I can see the SSID and connect wirelessly).&nbsp; However, I am not getting a DHCP lease, nor am I able to communicate with the unit via telnet, ssh or pings.</p><p>I do have another WRT with speedbooster sitting here next to me.&nbsp; Would that work?&nbsp; I&#039;m not familiar with the purpose or procedures behind the serial console, but it looks like it&#039;s time to start reading.&nbsp; Does it just throw you into the same console you see in SSH/telnet?</p><p>I guess I keep thinking that there should be some way to reset the NVRAM to a set of good defaults easily (i.e. using the reset button during the Linksys stock firmware).&nbsp; I wonder if there is a technical reason why that isn&#039;t done?&nbsp; (Or am I missing something?)</p><p>If you have some good beginners reads on how to setup the serial console between two WRTs, I would greatly appreciate it.&nbsp; Sounds like it may be worthwhile to setup a serial connection to my PC if that isn&#039;t too hard.&nbsp; (I can relate on the lack of soldering skills).&nbsp; :-)</p><p>Thanks again!</p>									</div>

					<p>Before proceeding further with the serial console, have you tried reflashin with TFTP?</p><p>That will revert back the default firewall, ipkg packages, etc. It won&#039;t change any nvram settings.</p>									</div>
