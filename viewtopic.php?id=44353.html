					<p>Hello all.<br />As the title stated above, I am trying to flash back my WRT54GS v.4 from OpenWrt Backfire 10.03.1 to the original firmware which is WRT54GS-v4_1.06.3.002_fw through the web GUI in order for me to install DDwrt firmware for assignment purpose. But it seems I cant revert it back through the web GUI, it kept prompting the message &quot;The uploaded image file does not contain a supported format. Make sure that you choose the generic image format for your platform.&quot; I am currently in a pinch right now because the dateline for the assignment is near. Any kind of help would be highly appreciated</p><p>Thanks </p><p>Biat</p>									</div>

I even tried the official Linksys TFTP recovery utility and it is not working too. I also tried to flash it to another firmware such as DDWRT just for the sake of trying but it also failed.</p>									</div>
