					<p>Hi,</p><p>It&#039;s been a while since I tried configuring my openwrt router.</p><p>I recently managed to get my Logitech C920 HD webcam streaming over my wifi network using mjpg-streamer.</p><p>The highest resolution without crashing...<br />1600x896<br />mjpg_streamer -i &quot;./input_uvc.so -d /dev/video0 -r 1600x896 -f 1&quot; -o &quot;./output_http.so -w www/webcam&quot;</p><p>No problem there... finally.</p><p>HOWEVER, I&#039;m trying to figure out how to stream audio from a microphone plugged into a usb audio adapter.</p><p>It doesn&#039;t have anything to do with the video - I want the audio streaming from another router.</p><p>I have installed:</p><p>opkg install kmod-usb-audio<br />opkg install kmod-usb-ohci</p><p>I tried to install gstreamer - but it won&#039;t fit - guess I&#039;ll have to run openwrt without LUCI.</p><p>I&#039;ve been looking all over the web trying to find&nbsp; some commands I can try to stream audio from a microphone connected to the router and record the audio on a computer on the network...</p><p>Well, after searching... I have no clue.</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p><p>I&#039;ve run across ssh into the router and running aplay?</p><p>I&#039;d like to be able to run, say VLC, and record the audio if possible.</p><p>Please, help.</p>									</div>

					<p>I haven&#039;t looked into this (search the forum), but I guess it has to do with aplay continuing to run after a logout.<br />This rings bells about other processes being killed upon logout, but I can&#039;t think of a solution.</p>									</div>
