					<p>i have an AR-150 router running CC. I&#039;d like to set up the WLAN as a client and a static IP, the WAN port with a static IP, and the LAN bridged to the WLAN. I am using the router with a RTL-SDR as a networked radio over wifi. The WAN port is for direct access through ethernet using SSH or a&nbsp; web browser. i&#039;ve tried a five or six configurations but keep bricking the router. i am very out of practice in configuring networks at the CL level, and could use a pointer to a good tutorial or some guided assistance.&nbsp; also... if there is a way to do what i am doing without reloading the firmware every time i brick the router, please let me know.</p><p>here is one i tried&nbsp; /etc/config/wireless </p><p>config wifi-device &#039;radio1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option type &#039;mac80211&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option hwmode &#039;11g&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option path &#039;platform/ar933x_wmac&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option htmode &#039;HT20&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option channel &#039;9&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option txpower &#039;18&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option country &#039;US&#039;</p><p>config wifi-iface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;radio1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ssid &#039;xxxxxxxxxxx&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option mode &#039;sta&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option encryption &#039;psk2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option key &#039;xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option network &#039;lan rtlsdrsvr&#039;</p><p>and /etc/config/network</p><p>config interface &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option force_link &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ip6assign &#039;60&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;192.168.20.1&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;dhcp&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option hostname &#039;HOTAKADAKE&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;wan6&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;@wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;dhcpv6&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;rtlsdrsvr&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;dhcp&#039;</p><p>this worked until i powered down the router. then i couldn&#039;t access through LuCI or SSH... getting &quot;host down&quot; messages. the only thing that worked was booting into uboot and reloading the firmware.&nbsp; thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>STA interfaces will not work as part of a bridge.&nbsp; This is because the AP expects all traffic to a STA to go to only one MAC address.&nbsp; If the AP is compatible, you could use AP-WDS and STA-WDS mode.&nbsp; This transmits the destination MAC as part of the packet so you can bridge.</p><p>Not sure why such would brick though.</p>									</div>
