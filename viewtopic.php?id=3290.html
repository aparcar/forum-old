					<p>Let me express my gratitude and respect for this piece of art to all developers: I just checked out the head branch and must say it is simply short of amazing to see everything fall into place. I originally used OpenWRT on WRT54GS 2.0 but had to switch to HyperWRT because back then the clkfreq=216 fix was unknown. A friend gave me his bricked WRT54G and now seeing wireless, ppp, dhcp and everything else just work with little trouble... duh. NICE!</p><p>I&#039;m looking forward to gcc-4 support, more shell magic, more packages, you people definitely give Linksys a run for their money. Their stock firmware may work but OpenWRT really outshines most of the other crap I have seen in the embedded world.</p><p>Best regards,<br />bsdice</p>									</div>

					<p>I agree with you on every statement and I would also like to remark that Linksys should be more thankfull with these guys here. I wonder why they want to think their products succeded because of their own good and forget about how much profit they got from openwrt community and all the modders out there.</p>									</div>

					<p>&lt;AliG&gt;Boo-yah!&nbsp; Maximum RAH-spec to OpenWRT and tha developa crew!&nbsp; Peace. &lt;/AliG&gt;</p><p>Seriously, what amazing piece of software is OpenWRT.&nbsp; It solves all matter of strife...&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; It&#039;s interesting to see that now OpenWRT is effectively a distro unto itself, it will outlive the WRT54G and continue to be compaitible with just about any router that is capable of running Linux.&nbsp; A landmark in embedded technology!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>danversj</strong> on 17 Nov 2005, 05:13)</p>
