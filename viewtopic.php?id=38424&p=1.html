					<p>Here is how to unbrick your tplink TL-WR1043ND (and possibly others too)</p><p>First you will need to download and install putty and tftpd32 server</p><p>putty: <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html</a><br/>TFTPD32: <a href="http://tftpd32.jounin.net/tftpd32_download.html">http://tftpd32.jounin.net/tftpd32_download.html</a><br/>Alternate to putty Termite: <a href="http://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm">http://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm</a></p><p>next you will need to find a USB to TTL cable lots on ebay.</p><p>To understand how to open your router, follow the excellent guide on the OpenWRT wiki: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd#openingclosing.the.case.">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd#openingclosing.the.case.</a></p><p>Once you have your cable and opened your router refer to this picture to locate and connect the cable correctly</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/_media/inbox/wr1043ndserial.jpg">http://wiki.openwrt.org/_media/inbox/wr1043ndserial.jpg</a></p><p>REMEMBER TO REVERSE THE Tx and Rx with your cable !!! IMPORTANT !!!<br/>NOTE: I didn&#039;t use the VCC connection only the GND Tx and Rx if you use the VCC use +3.3v connection</p><p>Once you have hooked up your cable correctly follow these instructions and you will be fine.</p><p>1. Download the sysupgrade firmware. (/use latest build/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr1043nd-v1-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin)<br/>You can download the latest firmware from here <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/</a><br/>2. Gain access to the serial port and hook it up to your computer using RS-232 / USB --&gt; TTL adapter.<br/>3. Run Putty, setup Serial connection, set COM port appropiately to your adapter in step 2 and do not click Open yet (baud rate: 115200 8N1 and set Flow Control to None)<br/>4. set networkcard of computer to ip address: 192.168.0.5 , subnetmask 255.255.255.0 and no gateway<br/>5. Run TFTP32 server on your computer, connect computer with ethernet cable to LAN switch port on router.<br/>6. Make sure the &quot;Current Directory&quot; in TFTP32 is set to folder with modified original firmware renamed to &quot;code.bin&quot;<br/>7. In Putty, click open and plug in Power cord to router... you should see bootloader coming up now...<br/>8. You will see something like this:</p><p>No valid address in Flash. Using fixed address<br/>: cfg1 0xf cfg2 0x7114<br/>eth0 up<br/>eth0<br/>Autobooting in 1 seconds## Booting image bf0200000...</p><p>Then type following fast: tpl</p><p>Now you will get into the command prompt and you&#039;re able to execute commands.</p><p>9. Erase the firmware before writing it again using following command: <strong>erase 0xbf020000 +7c0000</strong><br/>10. Download new modified original firmware from computer to the router: <strong>tftpboot 0x81000000 code.bin</strong><br/>11. Write the downloaded firmware to flash using: <strong>cp.b 0x81000000 0xbf020000 0x7c0000</strong><br/>12. Boot the original firmware again: <strong>bootm 0xbf020000</strong><br/>13. Let the router finish booting up and wait for everything to stop loading<br/>14. push ctrl + c than hit enter and now you should see the openwrt login screen</p><p>Your router should be unbricked again!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>phukit</strong> on 13 Dec 2012, 00:50)</p>

					<p>Thanks so much <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile"/>! I followed the guide and my router is now UNBRICKED! Here a little info for future router-brickers:</p><p>Instead of ordering a serial cable, which would&#039;ve taken a few days to get here, I used my Arduino duemilanove as a serial cable. This worked great, for more details see this post: <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=725420">http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=725420</a>. An Arduino diecimilia and I presume an Arduino Uno would work as well. Also, I didn&#039;t need to solder my wires to the board. I just used tin wires (the stiff ones, not the ones made from many small wires twisted together) and put them through the appropriate holes on the router board. Then I bent the wires so they couldn&#039;t move. Finally, I taped them down for good measure. No soldering required! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile"/></p><p>When wiring up Tx and Rx cables to the router, pay attention to what the terminal says. If it outputs characters like these: </p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Ýý &nbsp; &nbsp; Ỳỳ &nbsp; &nbsp; Ŷŷ &nbsp; &nbsp; Y̊ẙ &nbsp; &nbsp; Ÿÿ &nbsp; &nbsp; Ỹỹ &nbsp; &nbsp; Ẏẏ &nbsp; &nbsp; Ȳȳ &nbsp; &nbsp; Úú &nbsp; &nbsp; Ùù &nbsp; &nbsp; Ŭŭ &nbsp; &nbsp; Ûû &nbsp; &nbsp; Ǔǔ &nbsp; &nbsp; Ůů &nbsp; &nbsp; Üü &nbsp; &nbsp; Ǘǘ &nbsp; &nbsp; Ǜǜ &nbsp; &nbsp; Ǚǚ &nbsp; &nbsp; Ǖǖ &nbsp; &nbsp; Űű &nbsp; &nbsp; Ũũ &nbsp; &nbsp; Ṹṹ &nbsp; &nbsp; Ųų &nbsp; &nbsp; Ūū &nbsp; &nbsp; Ṻṻ &nbsp; &nbsp; Ủủ &nbsp; &nbsp; Ȕȕ &nbsp; &nbsp; Ȗȗ &nbsp; &nbsp; Ưư &nbsp; &nbsp; Ứứ &nbsp; &nbsp; Ừừ &nbsp; &nbsp; Ữữ &nbsp; &nbsp; Ửử &nbsp; &nbsp; Ựự<br/>Ụụ &nbsp; &nbsp; Ṳṳ &nbsp; &nbsp; Ṷṷ</p></blockquote></div><p> </p><p>etc., you&#039;ve wired Tx and Rx the wrong way round. Switch them and you should be ok <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile"/>. The little Tx LED on your Arduino should light up everytime the router enters the boot cycle. </p><p>Also, I used software called &#039;Termite&#039;, instead of Putty, because Putty wouldn&#039;t work for me :S you can get Termite here if Putty won&#039;t play ball with you either: <a href="http://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm">http://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm</a>. </p><p>To understand how to open your router, follow the excellent guide on the OpenWRT wiki: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd#openingclosing.the.case">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd#openingclosing.the.case</a>.</p><p>I didn&#039;t have the option to CTRL+C in Termite, but after I was sure the router was performing normally again, I unplugged it from the power, then removed the wires to the Arduino, and plugged the power back in. I could now access the Luci (=web) interface of OpenWRT <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile"/>!</p><p>@hugoleosp as sysupgrade, I used the latest beta from the download section. It&#039;s 12.09 beta 2, available here: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09-beta2/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr1043nd-v1-squashfs-factory.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_a … actory.bin</a>. This is for OpenWRT, however, not DD-WRT. If you prefer the latter, I&#039;d download and use their latest release.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Qopzeep</strong> on 25 Nov 2012, 17:36)</p>

					<p>I have bricked my 1043nd v1.8 while flashing back to original firmware: was not aware of special (non &quot;boot&quot;) version of tplink firmware and i used latest version from tplink server. now i cannot get any access to the router. is there any change to unbrick it?<br/>i could not connect via putty due to COM number, i dont have COM ports at all. USB_TTL is not recognized as COM therefore i dont know what to write to COM line of Putty. telnet, ping or safe mode does not work anymore.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br/>Today i bought TL-WR1043ND and bricked it immediately. I used this <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-tl-wr1043nd-v1-squashfs-factory.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … actory.bin</a> to update my firmware through original TP-Link WebGUI. I know that this firmware is old, but i followed instructions in order to just make my IPTV work (here&#039;s the link (in Lithuanian, though)): <a href="http://opa12345.blogspot.com/2012/05/teo-gala-televizija-ir-zebra-internetas.html">http://opa12345.blogspot.com/2012/05/teo-gala-televizija-ir-zebra-internetas.html</a> ). I bought this router just because i wanted to make IPTV available to all the connected PC&#039;s and to be stable on heavy use (on the older router which was very slow i managed to make IPTV available to all the connected devices). Now my new router lights up just Power light, and the port light when cable is connected. The Sys light is always off. I tried Fail Safe and hard reset (30-30-30) number of times, it didn&#039;t worked. I took apart the router and tried to connect it through serial port, i made USB-TLL cable from old Siemens phone cable, but it didn&#039;t work (maybe i messed up with cables?). Cable was not recognized by PC (didn&#039;t showed which COM port it uses), i didn&#039;t had any drivers. I read that Voltage should be 3.3 V, but my cable was more like 4.1 V. I hope i didn&#039;t fried the router, because it wasn&#039;t much of a difference (i read, that 5.0 V may fry, and 8V or more will certainly fry it ). Well, when my cable didn&#039;t worked, i ordered this: <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/281113958396?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1439.l2649">http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/281113958396?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1439.l2649</a> i hope it will help me to bring it to life (there&#039;s links to it&#039;s drivers). Maybe you can tell me if ~4.1 V wasn&#039;t too much? And maybe recommend any correct firmware if-when i recover my router to achieve this: <br/></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Network configuration (/etc/config/network) like this (GALA (IPTV STB) – 4 port):<br/>config &#039;interface&#039; &#039;loopback&#039;<br/>option &#039;ifname&#039; &#039;lo&#039;<br/>option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;static&#039;<br/>option &#039;ipaddr&#039; &#039;127.0.0.1&#039;<br/>option &#039;netmask&#039; &#039;255.0.0.0&#039;</p><p>config &#039;interface&#039; &#039;lan&#039;<br/>option &#039;ifname&#039; &#039;eth0.2&#039;<br/>option &#039;type&#039; &#039;bridge&#039;<br/>option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;static&#039;<br/>option &#039;ipaddr&#039; &#039;192.168.1.1&#039;<br/>option &#039;netmask&#039; &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;</p><p>config &#039;interface&#039; &#039;wan&#039;<br/>option &#039;ifname&#039; &#039;eth0.1&#039;<br/>option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;dhcp&#039;</p><p>config &#039;interface&#039; &#039;vlan6&#039;<br/>option &#039;ifname&#039; &#039;eth0.6&#039;<br/>option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;none&#039;<br/>option &#039;defaultroute&#039; &#039;0&#039;<br/>option &#039;peerdns&#039; &#039;0&#039;</p><p>config &#039;interface&#039; &#039;vlan5&#039;<br/>option &#039;ifname&#039; &#039;eth0.5&#039;<br/>option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;none&#039;<br/>option &#039;defaultroute&#039; &#039;0&#039;<br/>option &#039;peerdns&#039; &#039;0&#039;</p><p>config &#039;switch&#039;<br/>option &#039;name&#039; &#039;rtl8366rb&#039;<br/>option &#039;reset&#039; &#039;1&#039;<br/>option &#039;enable_vlan&#039; &#039;1&#039;</p><p>config &#039;switch_vlan&#039;<br/>option &#039;device&#039; &#039;rtl8366rb&#039;<br/>option &#039;vlan&#039; &#039;6&#039;<br/>option &#039;ports&#039; &#039;0t 4 5t&#039;</p><p>config &#039;switch_vlan&#039;<br/>option &#039;device&#039; &#039;rtl8366rb&#039;<br/>option &#039;vlan&#039; &#039;5&#039;<br/>option &#039;ports&#039; &#039;0t 5t&#039;</p><p>config &#039;switch_vlan&#039;<br/>option &#039;device&#039; &#039;rtl8366rb&#039;<br/>option &#039;vlan&#039; &#039;1&#039;<br/>option &#039;ports&#039; &#039;0 5t&#039;</p><p>config &#039;switch_vlan&#039;<br/>option &#039;device&#039; &#039;rtl8366rb&#039;<br/>option &#039;vlan&#039; &#039;2&#039;<br/>option &#039;ports&#039; &#039;1 2 3 5t&#039;</p><p>If you want to watch GALA (IPTV) on WiFi – you need to add this to /etc/rc.local:</p><p>ifconfig eth0.6 10.10.99.1 up<br/>udpxy&nbsp; -p 4022 -m 10.10.99.1 -B 4Kb -c 10<br/>exit 0</p></blockquote></div>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Kittciokas</strong> on 2 Jul 2013, 00:54)</p>
