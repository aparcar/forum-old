					<p>hi friends,</p><p>I thinking is there any openwrt package for the following?</p><p>Consider the following configuration</p><br /><p>Service Incoming WAN port from ISP -&gt; OpenWRT(Incoming) to one LAN Port, OpenWRT(Outgoing) to one LAN Port -&gt; Proprietary Router Wan Port -&gt; access triple play services</p><p>In the above connection I want to use my OpenWRT router in passthrough mode. The traffic passing through contains 3 streams VLAN tagged lets say A,B,C.<br />One for data, one for voice and another for IPTV. Now I want to monitor the traffic on VLAN basis -&nbsp; like bandwidth, packet loss and jitters individually on different VLANs A,B and C.</p><p>Now following are my questions<br />1. Is Iperf capable of monitoring traffic with VLAN tagged?<br />2. If IPerf can&#039;t do this is there any alternative OpenWRT package to do this kind of thing?</p><p>If anyone can provide some alternative solution to carryout the above thing I would be grateful.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>surjya</strong> on 21 Aug 2012, 09:18)</p>
