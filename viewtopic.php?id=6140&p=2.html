					<p>For those of you working with OpenWrt micro on these devices:</p><p>There really needs to be more tweaking of OpenWrt to allow for running on these devices. As I mentioned before, if you want *ANY* non-default packages, you need to package your own custom image so that they are on the SquashFs partition, which offers better compression than does JFFS2.</p><p>Additionally, since there&#039;s no room to write to the device after pre-include any decent number of packages, and OpenWrt doesn&#039;t make exclusive use of the nvram area for configuration, you end up with a box that is stuck largely in a &#039;static&#039; configuration. So, be sure to include any non-nvram configuration you want in the custom package as well.</p><p>This is currently one of my areas of interest, but it will take a lot of work to make OpenWrt useful, and will sacrifice many of the design goals of OpenWrt.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>db90h</strong> on 14 Jul 2006, 01:51)</p>

					<p>dd-wrt micro strips busybox (shell utils) out to the point where it&#039;s pretty useless. The utilities you mentioned aren&#039;t included. He made room for UPNP and other things.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>db90h</strong> on 18 Aug 2006, 09:57)</p>

					<p>FWIW, I found the hard way that the &quot;.bin&quot; file produced by the dd-wrt project is the equivalent of the &quot;.trx&quot; file produced by the openwrt buildroot-ng project.&nbsp; In order to put my custom image created with buildroot-ng on my WRT54Gv6 router, I had to tftp over the openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx file created by the buildroot, not the .bin file created.</p><p>Hopefully this will keep someone else from denting their forhead against the wall.</p><p>John</p>									</div>
