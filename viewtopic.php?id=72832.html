					<p>Hello everyone!<br />I have set up with tp-link mr3020 with chaos calmer and custom firmware.<br />There is basic support for usb drives and samba installed. Samba share works, but i can`t send any file to share with size greater than ~100 kb. In this case my USB stick (/dev/sda/) disconnects and connects as /dev/sdb/ , so samba share stop works(share set up for /dev/sda/). After router reboot all becomes all right...</p><p> There some info about mounted usb device settings:<br />2 partitions - sda1 (128 mb swap) and sda2 (1.6 GB, for share,ext4)<br />sda2 mounted to /mnt/share/<br />Access to share via password for non-root user.</p><p>Could anyone help me with this issue?</p>									</div>

I try to find any samba or kernel logs, but unsuccessfully. Google tells me that samba logs must be in&nbsp; /var/logs/samba, but &quot;samba&quot; directory doesn`t consist them.<br />If you tell me where i can find kernel and samba logs, it`ll be great!</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry for the delay in response.</p><p>Kernel log can be reviewed by issuing the command &quot;dmesg&quot; from an SSH prompt. It prints the content of the kernel ring-buffer log.</p><p>Logs for samba are sent to the system log in OpenWrt&#039;s default config, and the amount of logging depends on the value set in the smb.conf template. You&#039;ll find it in &quot;/etc/samba/smb.conf.template&quot;. The setting you are looking for is called &quot;syslog&quot;. If you set it to &#039;10&#039;, samba should print pretty much everything to the log.</p><p>System log can be viewed with the &quot;logread&quot; command.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you so much for the reply, but i already solved my problem. Solution was the simplest - i just replace my USB flash stick to another one. I don`t know what was causing a problem, and have not much time for discovering.<br />However, maybe this post with your information about logs will help anyone with same problems.<br />Thank you one more time!</p>									</div>
