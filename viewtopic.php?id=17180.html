					<p>Hello,<br />I wanted to test how effective is a CompressionLevel on a ssh connection but it looks like that the dropbear ssh server doesn&#039;t offer any compression. I mande the following test</p><p>scp a 2MB pdf file to my openwrt box and I captured the traffic with tshark to see how much data are transfered on the wire:</p><p>No compression&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : size of the captured file 2.1 MB<br />CompressionLevel 9 : size of the captured file 2.1 MB</p><p>The same test on a OpenBSD ssh server:<br />No compression&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : size of the captured file 2.1 MB<br />CompressionLevel 9 : size of the captured file 812K</p><p>.. so it looks like the compression of a ssh is not offered by the dropbear server. Any ideas how to activate it ?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Tex</p>									</div>
