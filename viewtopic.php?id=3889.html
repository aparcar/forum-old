					<p>had similar problem and found following work-around:<br />via regedit on the Windows PC go to the<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\Interfaces\{some_key_code}&nbsp; &nbsp; (try the various interfaces to find the one that connects to the openwrt box) and create two new DWORD entries<br />MTU 1492&nbsp; &nbsp; (decimal)<br />TCPWindowSize 130000 (decimal, value not critical but should be in this magnitude)</p><p>Close regedit.<br />Make the new TCPIP configuration active for this interface by going to&nbsp; &#039;Network and Dial-up connections&#039; and disable the interface and then enable it again. Now you should be on the net !</p><p>Would welcome hints how to cure this within OpenWRT, but the above works for me but it is a nuisance having to make the adjustment in every PC.</p><p>rgds, doddel</p>									</div>

Perhaps the fragment request ICMP packets (or mtu discovery packets) aren&#039;t getting forwarded to your workstations? Check your firewall rules on the wrt.</p><p>But in any case the probable source of the aggravation is that your ISP is probably running vlans over some equipment that won&#039;t handle normal ethernet MTU when tags are added on.
