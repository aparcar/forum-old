					<p>hi,</p><p>got a older openwrt white russian rc6 lying around but i currently only need the wifi access from the box because the real router (a full linux box) does not provide it.</p><p>the network already got a dhcp server running so i disabled dnsmasq on the box. <br />the routers wan port isnt used, the switch is connected to the rest of the network.<br />but using my laptop i dont get a wireless connection, just keeps connecting. </p><p>i was hoping that i could connect to the routers wifi and my laptop would pick up a ip from the lans dhcp...is this a possibility or do i need to configure openwrt in a specific way?</p><p>keep up the good work <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
