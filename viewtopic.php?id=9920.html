					<p>please report what &#039;wl rate&#039; reports as modulation speed.</p><p>With the kind of signal strength that you have you should be getting the full 54 Mbps modultion rate.<br />That is never the real throughput as the system has overhead and is working half-duplex, i.e. either transmitting or receiving, so the 54 Mbps medium is only available &#039;part-time&#039;.</p><p>If you see lower values of modulation than that is indicative of noise on the channel.<br />What do you see with &#039;wl scan ; sleep 1 ; wl scanresults&#039; as command ? Can be given direct from the client; from the ap you first have to temporarily make it a client (&#039;wl ap 0&#039;) to be able to scan.<br />Ideally there should be no other strong signals 2 channels up and down from the used channel as a 802.11g signal is 5 channels wide. Unfortunately you won&#039;t see this way any ap with beacon switched off, so what you see is best case, reality may be worse. I have only experience with wrt54g(l) Linksys units and on those an 80 dBm noise reading would also indicate presence of other signals. Here noise readings in the 90-95 dBm are typical for a clear channel.</p><p>Another good indicator of link quality is doing pings from one side to the other for a while and observe the time readings. They should be nicely constant and in the 1.8-2.2 ms realm. If there are many higher values than that also indicates interference because apparently re-transmissions are made before even the brief ping packet gets across undamaged.</p><p>For your reference; with almost identical antennas (my 80 cm parabola feeds are of a short yagi type) and similar power I bridge 7.5 km at 54 Mbps modulation rate.</p><p>Another thing:<br />1 km should be within what the standard protocol timing allows for, so no distance setting needed. If you do anyway I think you should set the one-way distance.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>doddel</strong> on 17 Mar 2007, 13:12)</p>

					<p>Sorry to jump on this post as a &quot;first post&quot;, but I might contribute my experience which is very similar to jailbreaker&#039;s.</p><p>I have a 7km link with 15dBi antennas (yagi, hand tuned) and power output of 35mW (buffalo whr-hp-g54). </p><p>The reported RSSI is -53dBm and signal noise varies between -79dBm and -85dBm depending on the day of week (on weekends SNR improves and during weekdays it worsenes).</p><p>Some of the noise might be because of other antennas (2.4Ghz wifi) which are installed on the same towers.</p><p>The link sync speed varies between 1Mbps with rain to 5.5Mbps on a perfect day. <strong>The Interesting thing is that it will hold sync at up to 48-54Mbps</strong>, and will not loose a single packet (even big fat 1500 byte pings), but troughput is only good at the &quot;automaticly&quot; selected rate (indicating that on higher speeds I get retransmissions at the packet level and no errors). </p><p>I think the channels are <strong>full</strong>: Channel 1 and 3 are occupied by other links. I&#039;m transmitting on channel 6. There must be a &quot;hidden&quot; and powerfull link (or noise) on channel 11 as it&#039;s impossible to get a sync from channel 9 to 13 included.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mesher</strong> on 18 Mar 2007, 10:39)</p>

					<p>1. Regarding distance setting following is the case:<br />in wificonf.c (which produces the wifi binary) the register setting for timing is calculated as follows:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if (v = nvram_get(wl_var(&quot;distance&quot;))) { <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;val = strtol(v,NULL,0); <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;val = 9+(val/150)+((val%150)?1:0); </p><p>i.e. the basic 9 microseconds is incresed with distance/150.<br />In 1 microsecond the radio wave travels 300 meters. Assume the distance setting to be one-way distance, then distance/300 would add the microseconds for one-way; but the formula already accounts for the return distance by only dividing by 150. So the comment on the x-wrt screen is WRONG if the entry on the management screen is directly put in the nvram wl0_distance parameter.</p><p>2. set the country to ALL and do so before attempting channel changes. ALL enables ch 1-14.</p><p>3. agree that e.g. channel 12 may work better. Channels 4,7,8 &amp; 9 carry strong signals.<br />In my experience you may also see interference from other users of the spectrum. Notorious problem causers are these AV links to connect a video source to a television elsewhere; they are FM transmitters on 2.4 GHz often cheap and unstable and sweeping through the band. Microwave ovens are the other polluter. But that&#039;s why it is ISM band and license free; no pay - no unique use, unlike gsm.</p><p>4. have you made sure that the distance setting is active on both units ?<br />I&#039;ve a little binary, &#039;sdist&#039; , that shows the register settings. Put it in //usr/sbin, make it executable, and you&#039;ll see the relevant register values. <a href="http://www.dorpstraat.com/OpenWrt/sdist">http://www.dorpstraat.com/OpenWrt/sdist</a><br />One is 9 microsec plus the extra time, the other is 510 (both decimal, but reporting is in hex) plus the extra time.<br />There is an issue with this setting in that as a result of autonomous actions by the broadcom proprietary radio driver wl.o, e.g. when (re-)associations occur, the timing gets reset to the basic one. As part of the watchdog cycle wifi regularly updates these registers but there may be brief intervals during which they are wrong. This may explain the drops in datarate that you see. You may do the &#039;wl rate&#039; test again and add the sdist reporting to see whether momentary changes in distance setting correlate with drops in datarate.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>doddel</strong> on 18 Mar 2007, 14:01)</p>

					<p>good to see that the modulation now gets towards the 54 Mbps.<br />Actually you should do the measurement in presence of real traffic so you may add add a &#039;ping -c 1 &lt;ipaddress of the other side&gt;&#039; command to the test cycle to generate traffic. In absence of traffic the radio communication quality statistics easily look bad due to received noise and interference and the driver reduces rates in reaction to that. The distance setting looks to be ok and stable, but you need to check on both sides !</p><p>The 1 Mbps values are of course very bad; are you indeed using identical settings on both ends of the link, apart from one side ap and the other client ? Values of 1 and 2 Mbps I only see here when there is a timing issue but with your short distance and very strong signal this shouldn&#039;t happen. If all settings would be ok I can only explain it from the presence of very strong interference.</p><p>Effective datarates that I get here, e.g. transferring a file from one router to the other using wget, over the 7.5 km distance are in the 20-24 Mbps realm. We transport two adsl2+ 8 Mbps accesses over one such radio link.</p>									</div>

					<p>After &#039;walking&#039; through all channels I noticed that upper&nbsp; ones are much more susceptible to noise -- couldn&#039;t get a stable sync at 54mbps at 12, 13 and 14 -- got 18-48 most of the time, and did scanning/testing/tuning mostly at night, when noise is at it&#039;s lowest. Now I reverted back to channel 2, which got me a stable link at 54mbps, but real data throughput is still in the ~10Mbit/sec (<strong>at max</strong>) range <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />The final thing coming to my mind to try is to use horizontal polarization.

IIRC &#039;8&#039; is horizontal and a laying &#039;8&#039; is vertical.<br />So I&#039;ll try rotating my feeders 90 degrees and report back any success, if any.
