					<p>I see that there are several builds for bcm53xx Netgear routers such as r6250, r6300v2 and r8000. I would like to try building openwrt for the R6200.</p><p>Is there any fundamental difference between the R6200 and the R6250? I have not compiled openwrt before, and I would appreciate some help if possible. Of course, simply trying to upload the r6250 firmware on the r6200 is rejected by the web interface.</p><p>I am sure the r6200 can support openwrt, since there is an unofficial dd-wrt build, which is somewhat not complete (I can not get proper IPV6 support from it).</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>A lot of Broadcom devices are only partially supported due to newer wireless chips not being supported by the publicly available drivers.</p><p>DD-Wrt seems to have NDAs in place with Broadcom so they can use newer (but proprietary) wireless drives. OpenWrt/LEDE do not.</p>									</div>
