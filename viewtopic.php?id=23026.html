					<p>I have a WRT54GL with kamikaze. I am a beginner in openwrt, so maybe this is a very stupid question, but I just can&#039;t seem to get the solution by myself. <br />Because I am on a university network I have one cable coming out of the wall that gives me my internet and makes me able to fileshare with every other computer that is connected to this network. For me to have internet as well as acces to the local network I added this startup script:</p><p><strong>/etc/rc.d/S48lanonwan</strong><br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common

START=48

start(){
include /lib/network
scan_interfaces

config_get WAN wan ifname
config_get LAN lan ifname
config_get WANDEV wan device
config_get WANTYPE wan proto

WANLAN=$(nvram get wan_also_masq_lan)


if [ $WANTYPE = &quot;pppoe&quot; -a $WANLAN = &quot;on&quot; ]; then
udhcpc -i $WANDEV -b -p /var/run/$WANDEV.pid -R

iptables -t nat -A zone_wan_nat -o $WANDEV -j MASQUERADE
iptables -A forwarding_lan -i $LAN -o $WANDEV -j ACCEPT
fi
}</code></pre></div><p>However now I am not able to browse other computer connected to the local network. How do I need to configure openwrt so I can get internet and filesharing?</p>									</div>

					<p>Not sure why you are doing what you are doing in the rc.local file.</p><p>Your setup really isn&#039;t unique. The cable coming out of your wall should just plug into the WAN port like you would if you were just connecting to a cable modem directly. Using the standard setup in /etc/config/networks you would obtain an IP address via DHCP (probably a 172. or 192. address) that would provide you access to the internet at large. Your private computers behind your router will need to have their own address space as to not clober with that of the universities. For instance if you get a 192 address from the university you can&#039;t have your address range be in the 192 as well or else the router will not forward requests correctly. You can probably fix this by modifying the routing table but the best route would be to have separate private address spaces.</p>									</div>

The switch on the OpenWRT device could have a 192. range and his university could be in the 172. range. Then the router would handle the routing to the 172 range. Pretty simple I think, but I may be wrong.</p>									</div>

I am not that familiar with PPPoE but I assume you set your WAN connection to PPPoE in the /etc/config/network. When you successfully connect, doesn&#039;t that initiate some sort of IP address assignment so that you don&#039;t need to run DHCP after that? If you don&#039;t run DHCP on the PPPoE connection, have the connection is made and that interface is brought up, what is the output of ifconfig for it?</p>									</div>

ResNet is offered as a RJ-45 outlet in each room.

The supported protocols are Fast Ethernet and Ethernet (IEEE 802.3u and IEEE 802.3). 
On this ethernet segment a DHCP server (RFC 2131), a DNS server, a NTP server and a HTTP server are available. 
What is not available is a gateway to internet (except for multicast traffic). 
Further, a PPPoE Access Concentrators (RFC 2516) are available. 
The TU Delft operates an Access Concentrator under the name &#039;DePoort&#039; offering the service &#039;TUdelft-FTTD&#039;. 
All student and staff of TU Delft have a serviceaccount and can use that to log on to the TUdelft-FTTD&#039; service. 
This service uses CHAP encryption.</code></pre></div><p>I downloaded a portscanner and when I scan a roommate (172.x) from my laptop (192.x) I do see that the 139 port is open with him. On the otherhand when I portscan my router (172.x) from my roommate&#039;s computer (172.x) I see that only 22,53 and 80 are open. This is very strange since I do have forwarded(redirected) the 137-138,139 and 445 ports to my laptop..</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jwvandongen</strong> on 4 Jan 2010, 03:02)</p>

					<p>Here is what I think the problem is. Forget the PPPoE connection that you need so that you can access the network.</p><p>When you plug your OpenWRT device into the switch provided by your University, the WAN interface obtains a 172. IP address. Through that you can ping other roomates, etc that are connected to that switch. </p><p>You then plug in some additional computers you have to the ports on the OpenWRT device and they obtain a 192 address. The reason that file browsing probably isn&#039;t working is that those computers, when searching for devices that are sharing, send out a broadcast message. Broadcast messages are not transmitted to different networks so they never get routed to those other hosts in the 172 range. </p><p>You can probably do some firewall re-write rule to have broadcasts sent to 192.168.1.255 re-written to 172.x.255.255.</p>									</div>

Maybe check <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/firewall">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/firewall</a> and do a redirect or rule to transfer traffic destined for 192.168.1.255 to the broadcast for 172. The only thing you will need to worry about is how OpenWRT sets these up. I don&#039;t have it on hand right now but I once found a great diagram that shows where each chain takes place in the processing. Obviously this rule would have to be in a chain that is prior to routing or else it won&#039;t work (if I am mistaken please, someone with better knowledge correct me).</p><p>Oh, and if I understand what you were trying to say. I don&#039;t think you can set the broadcast address for br-lan to 172.20.19.255 as it is not part of that network.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cyrus_mc</strong> on 5 Jan 2010, 02:31)</p>
