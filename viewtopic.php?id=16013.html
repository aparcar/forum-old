					<p>Hi there,</p><p>today I wanted to upgrade my WGT634U from some old 5xxx version to Kamikaze 7.09. Got the code, compiled without problems, flashed and crashed. - CFE boot was OK, but Linux only printed some unreadable crap and restarted immediately. Looks like a problem in my build environment, because the official binaries work. Does someone else have a clue why this could happen?</p><p>So I thought who needs 7.09 anyway - let&#039;s head straight to bleeding edge. Got the code compiled and flashed. No crash here, but two problems at the moment:<br />- /sbin/usb-storage is completely broken. It can and does not work so I wonder how this crap could get in and why nobody noticed? I think I&#039;m able to correct this script at least for my personal needs.</p><p>- How am I supposed to have WPA in AP mode? The madwifi.sh script doesn&#039;t look really promising. Support for wpa_supplicant is only supported for WDS mode as I can see and I remember that hostapd didn&#039;t work out of the box in my old version. Should it work now?</p>									</div>

					<p>If anyone is interested, I have submitted my usb-storage version as patch in ticket #3551.<br />And WPA really worked without problems after installing hostapd-mini.</p>									</div>
