					<p>Hello,</p><p>Flashed latest OpenWRT image and everything is working just fine. However there is not much space left for additional apps, so I was thinking of doing some HW modifications. </p><p>Target is:</p><p>1) Maintain the external USB port.<br />2) Add second USB port hidden inside the box.<br />3) Use USB storage on the hidden port to allow bigger apps to be installed.</p><p>Plan was to de-solder the existing USB port, add a small USB hub inside and connect it to the old USB pins. Solder the old USB port to the hub. </p><p>Is this a possible solution? And how about the software. Can I run the entire system on a USB device connected through a hub? Or do I need to keep the base system on built-in flash, and use the USB storage only for addtional apps?</p><p>Br, Joakim</p>									</div>

					<p>It can&#039;t boot from USB.&nbsp; You will need a base system in the internal flash.&nbsp; The overall concept is that very shortly after booting, the entire root filesystem is &quot;pivoted&quot;, or replaced by an extended copy on the USB drive.&nbsp; The kernel booted out of the internal flash continues to run.</p><p>If you only need 8 or 16 MB of space, upgrading the flash chip is also possible.&nbsp; This will require a hacked build to use the larger chip.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 30 Jan 2017, 20:23)</p>
