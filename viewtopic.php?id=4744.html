					<p>I&#039;m trying to do the SD mod and am unable to compile a kernel for my WRT54GS. I downloaded OpenWrt-ImageBuilder-Linux-i686.tar.b2z and extracted it. I was unable to find the buildroot/build_mipsel/linux directory referenced in the documentation, there was no linux directory only a linux-2.4-brcm directory that had two files, kernel_2.4.30-brcm-2_mipsel.ipk&nbsp; vmlinux.lzma. There did not appear to be any type of makemenuconfig script in the entire set of directories. </p><p>I know that I could download the modules seperately and install them, but I would like to compile. The main reason for this is I want to change the gpio numbers and therefore have to compile mmc.o myself anyway and therefore need everything set up. </p><p>Thanks in Advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>Quick cheat sheet of what everything is -</p><p>ImageBuilder -<br />Designed to assemble precompiled packages into a firmware image. Incapable of performing any other task. Use - easily alter which packages are included within the firmware itself, useful if you&#039;re reflashing multiple devices and want to avoid manual package installation. This is also what produces the multiple variations of the firmware available for download (default, micro, pptp)</p><p>SDK -<br />Essentially a stripped down version of the actual sources; includes a prebuilt compiler and various headers and libraries; has the ability to compile most packages. Does not compile kernel or most kernel modules. Use - quickly compiling one or two applications without having to build the compiler first.</p><p>OpenWrt sources -<br />This is what&#039;s available via svn, developers refer to these sources as &#039;buildroot&#039; indicating the original origins of the code. This is designed to be a fully automated system to download, patch and compile everything needed to produce a working firmware image from scratch. Having a copy of buildroot is essential for anything not covered by imagebuilder or the SDK.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, I downloaded the right thing, the buildroot, and after a lot of scripted downloads and compiles, got the images and the ability to cross-compile. I should be able to do everything I want now.</p>									</div>
