					<p>I am just getting started with odhcp6c myself, but I&#039;m wondering: were you testing stateful DHCPv6 only, or was your DHCP server also configured for stateless (RA)?<br />From the odhcp6c README:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>1. IPv6 bootstrap from different environments with autodetection<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; a) RA only<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; b) RA + stateless DHCPv6<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; c) RA + stateful DHCPv6 (either IA_NA or IA_PD or both)</p></blockquote></div><p>Is &quot;stateful DHCPv6 only&quot; even supported?</p>									</div>
