					<p>After lots of fiddling I got acx wireless up and running (will submit my /lib/wifi/acx.sh on trac). However, I have two problems. If I turn on WEP encryption, I can&#039;t get my computer to associate with the router. And even if I turn encryption off, I&#039;m unable to get dnsmasq to answer my&nbsp; DHCP requests <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>I see the following error message in my kernel logs</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Oct 11 23:04:47 Netgear daemon.info dnsmasq[858]: DHCPDISCOVER(wlan0) 169.254.150.106 00:11:09:17:24:12

Oct 11 23:04:52 Netgear user.warn kernel: wlan0: several excessive Tx retry errors occurred, attempting to recalibrate radio. Radio drift might be caused by increasing card temperature, please check the card before it&#039;s too late!
Oct 11 23:04:52 Netgear user.warn kernel: wlan0: tx error 0x20, buf 04! (excessive Tx retries due to either distance too high or unable to Tx or Tx frame error - try changing &#039;iwconfig txpower XXX&#039; or &#039;sens&#039;itivity or &#039;retry&#039;)</code></pre></div><p>I don&#039;t think that the radio is getting too hot as the error message implies because my router hasn&#039;t been running for very long. Also the connection should be excellent as router and laptop are sitting right next to eachother.</p><p>Any ideas?</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>
