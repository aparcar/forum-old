					<p>I have a WL-520GU with a Broadcom BCM5354 SoC. Using Kamikaze_8.09_rc1 I can successfully boot using brcm-2.4.</p><p>However when I try to boot using the 2.6 kernel (brcm47xx) I get :</p><p>Loader:raw Filesys:raw Dev:flash0.os File: Options:(null)<br />Loading: .. 3760 bytes read<br />Entry at 0x80001000<br />Closing network.<br />Starting program at 0x80001000</p><p>and then it hangs.</p><p>If I gzip the 2.6 kernel, attach the squashfs and put the TRX headers on and load this, 2.6 works. This suggests the kernel is fine. (It works quite well, except for the size constraint) </p><p>This suggests it has something to do with the lzma-loader. I notice slight differences in the file size of lzma-loader for the 2.4 and 2.6. I&#039;ve done a diff on both lzma-loaders for 2.4 and 2.6 and at a source level they appear to be identical. I suspected it could be a byte-alignment issue, but the flags used to compile each version is the same, so I can only assume a library is different (unless I have missed something). </p><p>Before I dig further into this, does anyone have the same problem or better still a solution?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi. Just want to know if you&#039;ve got it work or not...? I tried using the 2.6 on a WBR2-G54 but it doesn&#039;t boot as well. The 2.4 kernel works through.</p><p>BTW, how you got the logs and knew where the kernel is struck...? Is it via JTAG or something else?</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>

					<p>I have a serial cable connected to mine to get the console messages. I would love JTAG, but my $52 el cheapo &quot;development&quot; board doesn&#039;t have JTAG broken out <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I was successful in getting RC1 to work - The 800-fix_cfe_detection.patch adds a patch to target/linux/brcm47xx/patches-2.6.25/ which in turns patches arch/mips/bcm47xx/prom.c during build time, or at least that is the plan. I noticed the 2nd patch during build time didn&#039;t apply properly, so I applied it by hand.</p><p>Initially I gave up on RC1 and moved straight across to the trunk which already had the fix. I&#039;m now running R13191 but I notice that doesn&#039;t work either. Looking at prom.c, it also appears to be broken but there is no reject file left behind as evidence. I&#039;ve let to sit down and work out what is going wrong with the patch in the trunk. </p><p>Now off to look at the b43 wireless driver on RC1 . . .</p>									</div>

					<p>Cool, thanks for that wzab.</p><p>Jim, how reliable have you found booting is after commenting out functions prom_init_console_cfe(); &amp; prom_init_cmdline_cfe(); ?</p><p>I applied the same changes to RC1 - prom.c than was in the trunk. As I mentioned a couple of nights ago, I could get RC1 working, but not the trunk. I just recorded this as an observation and pushed on. At the time I had compared the changes between RC1 and the trunk and they were identical.</p><p>Last night I applied the USB patches as pointed out by wzab. After I did this, my kernel would no longer boot with the same behavior than before - it hangs immediately after Starting program at 0x80001000. I removed all the USB modules, but could not successfully get the kernel to load again.</p><p>I then decided to push that build aside and grab a fresh RC1 and start again. I applied the CFE/prom.c patch as before but this time it wouldn&#039;t work either.&nbsp; Following some of Mr S Brown&#039;s work, I commented out what you had done Jim, and it still wouldn&#039;t work. S Brown had also commented out setup_early_printk(); in /arch/mips/kernel/setup.c so I tried this and bingo - it worked.</p><p>However when I applied the USB patches, I broke it again <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>So I have come to the conclusion the CFE detection is still flaky at best and I need to learn to walk before I can run. I&#039;m going to concentrate on this area first and see if I can get a robust solution.</p>									</div>
