					<p>I am having trouble getting openWRT on my Linksys WAG160N (annex A).<br />I looked at the hardware page and it mentions Platform Broadcom 6358, but I do not see any related image under the brcm63xx folder (<a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09-rc1/brcm63xx/generic/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_a â€¦ x/generic/</a>). Which one do I need to select from all those files listed?</p><p>I tried building on my linux vm, but I got the same files. Still no clue which one to choose.</p><p>I also tried to understand the build that can be downloaded from the WAG160N dedicated page (by Virus), but I have also no clue how to get that into an image I could use.</p><p>Please help! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
