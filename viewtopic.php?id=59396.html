					<p>Im trying to setup my router to make a site to site connection to my VPN server. I have successfully setup strongswan and its connecting to the SA fine. Now I&#039;m stuck on how to get the l2tp portion of this to work. From what i have gathered openl2tp is the package i want to use since it&#039;s the only one that kernel mode. Is this correct? how do you get openl2tp to create a connection once strongswan establishes a connection with the SA? Any push in the right direction would be lots of help since everything I&#039;m finding pertains to using the router as the server and not a client.</p>									</div>
