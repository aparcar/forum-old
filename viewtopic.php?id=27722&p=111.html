					<p>After reading your first comment, I do not think it will help you in any way. As you said yourself, you cannot reach the router after the changes and we need to see the files <em>after</em> the changes, since you cannot reach it at that time, you cannot show them. I&#039;d advise you to manually config the files, with vi or through the winscp editor.</p>									</div>

					<p>I found out that when using samba, the combination &quot;security = user&quot; and &quot;use sendfile = yes&quot; makes samba very irratic with transfering speeds from the router to (only tested it on this OS) a Windows 7 installation. Speeds are 7MB/s max (mostly 2-3MB/s) and sometimes the copying comes to a pause. Maybe this is intended behavior by samba, but I got to the point where changing &quot;use sendfile = no&quot; solved my problems. When using the open share (&quot;security = share&quot;) it is no problem at all with &quot;use sendfile = yes&quot; which is supposed to give a higher throughput (which I never saw a difference in myself, except for the negative effect of course).</p><p>A sidenote:<br />If you go the &quot;security = user&quot; route, then you have to change a few more things to get it working though (add users, set passwords, add user options to the /etc/config/samba file and change &quot;guest account = nobody&quot; and &quot;guest = no&quot;), so, only changing that option will not get you password protected shares.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>johan81</strong> on 5 Apr 2012, 14:01)</p>
