					<p>Hi, there are several other ongoing threads addressing this topic.&nbsp; Basically, for routers that have only one radio, this sort of repeater application works by creating a second virtual SSID.&nbsp; There is a bug whereby if the first (WWAN) connection is not made, the wifi crashes, thus the WLAN is not available to connect and reconfigure.</p><p>One solution is to add a second radio via USB <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=58548.">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=58548.</a>&nbsp; Note that many of us have found that the throughput performance is not very good in many cases, so we use the USB wifi device just as a &quot;configuration SSID&quot; to the device, allowing you to configure the onboard radio to connect to WWAN, then setting up WLAN.</p><p>Another solution is to just know you will need to connect via Ethernet frequently to make these changes, and to plan accordingly.</p><p>This topic has come up in <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=53014,">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=53014,</a> albeit a rather long thread by now.</p><p>Good luck!</p>									</div>

					<p>It appears that both of the last 2 are tested on Ralink/Mediatek.&nbsp; Not sure if that makes a difference.</p><p>This also came up yesterday, but it&#039;s implementation and operation I have questioned in the last post.<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=43352">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=43352</a></p><p>I have added a USB wireless adapter to avoid all these problems, but it has slower performance.&nbsp; For me it seems to be ok, but others report this does not work well at all.</p>									</div>
