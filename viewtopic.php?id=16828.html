					<p>Does anyone know how to control the LEDs of the ubiquiti powerstation and nanostation (i have a PS2 and an NS2). i mean is there a /proc file or kernel module which can do so? or does any1 have a kernel patch to do the same. my ultimate aim is that i have to write a script which shows the strength on the signal meter. i m a pretty advanced linux user, so i dont mind a really technical documentation. please just give me some guidance or starting point. coz rite now i dont even know where to start, which gpio pins / hardware address to use if i must make a kernel module?</p>									</div>

					<p>ok, i think this shud do it. this was described on the following site:<br /><a href="http://www.toulouse-sans-fil.net/mediawiki-1.4.9/index.php?title=NanoStation2&amp;redirect=no">http://www.toulouse-sans-fil.net/mediaw â€¦ edirect=no</a><br />this is probably specific to the nano.</p><p>i have not had a chance to verify this, since i dont have a nano as i write this. the site above is in french, so i will take the main gist and translate it for u.</p><p>the first prerequisite is that u must have gpioctl package installed.</p><p>The four leds are assigned to pins 0, 1, 3 and 4 (the order of leds is red, yellow, green, green) of the on-chip gpio.</p><p>gpioctl command syntax is as follows:<br />gpioctl &lt;operation&gt; &lt;pin&gt;</p><p>the operations can be set, clear and get.<br />set turns the pin on, clear turns the pin off and get fetches the current status of the pin.</p><p>so to turn on the red led, u can do<br />gpioctl set 0</p><p>to turn the yellow led off, u can do<br />gpioctl clear 1</p><p>to see if the first green led is on, u can do<br />gpioctl get 3</p>									</div>
