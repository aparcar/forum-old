					<p>Hi all.</p><p>I&#039;ve just been given an old (ar7) netgear DG834G (v2) - under the lid is a minipci / vlynq slot. It currently contains the original TI TNETW1130GVF but I know the acx111 driver is still flakey.</p><p>Now that the vlynq sockets are understood, would an atheros/madwifi card work in the slot? If not, are there any recommended minipci/vlynq cards which have reasonable drivers available (and would work in AP mode)?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t know if anything has changed, but I tried it a while ago and could not get it to work. Then someone explained that vlynq cards could be used in minipci slots, but not the other way around.</p>									</div>
