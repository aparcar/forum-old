					<p>Hi,</p><p>I did a new image with my package list.<br />It is 2,79M. I was able to upload it in my WRT54GL.<br />(after I reload the original image because just 64k<br />free space was on the flash)<br />It starts booting (LEDs blink in the right order) and<br />I can&#039;t reach the router. No ping. :-(<br />I ping 192.168.1.1 of course.<br />If I reload the original RC4 (openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin)<br />everything is all right.<br />Ping reaches the router because port 1 LED is blinking<br />but no answer.</p><p>I don&#039;t know what is the problem with my image ...</p><p>TIA,<br />Ruzsi</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I found the problem.</p><p>I removed bridge package from my image and I think I erased NVRAM.<br />On Internet port the router asked an IP address from DHCP server but<br />all ports are closed.</p><p>My next problem:<br />I backed up the image as described in README to .trx file and NVRAM<br />in .txt file. But how can I reuse them? Putting back .trx file the router<br />again unreachable. :-(<br />Can I unload files from .trx?</p><p>TIA,<br />Ruzsi</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Huhhh. It was a hard work! Router is working now with my new image.<br />I combined closing pins of flash chip and stopping in safe mode. I<br />don&#039;t know which one was the solution but I was surprised when<br />I shaw the ping answer result in my terminal windows.</p><p>I typed in my backed up nvram settings but what about my<br />config files which are in my .trx file which is different from<br />recent image?</p><p>TIA,<br />Ruzsi</p>									</div>
