					<p>Hi,</p><p>first i am located on the Greek part of the Island Cyprus and i am running Chaos Calmer on TP-Link N600 WDR3600 V1.4 behind a Bridged ZXDSL 931VII, naturally my ISP is Cyta.com.cy<br />My local clients get there IP&#039;s via DHCP from openwrt.<br />I followed the unbound wiki HOWTO and everything seemed to work nice, tests with dnsleak pages showed me that i was using my custom DNS.</p><p>Recently my ISP had some cables in my area wired wrong and the ISP modem kept disconnecting and reconnecting. This was quickly fixed by their support.</p><p>Now what also happened during that time. <br />My custom DNS entry&#039;s were ignored and i was using my ISP entries, Luci&#039;s pppoe-wan Interface shows my custom DNS entry&#039;s which are not used.</p><p>For now i defaulted back to using manual DNS entries in Windows 10.</p><p>What am i doing wrong? Why do i loose my custom DNS entries when the bridged ISP Modem disconnects?</p>									</div>
