So, a lot of comments posted didn&#039;t have enough references, that I know about, to make much sense to me (what to do | what to look for). So, I&#039;ve held off trying to mess with u-boot until someone can dumb it down enough to where i can understand.</p><p>What I have done so far is Serial/TTL to the router, and flashed both primary and backup to the Stock Firmware. I then logged into the Stock firmware, and using the Gui, flashed to the latest version of lede (No Serial/TTL). Since I was able to flash without Serial/TTL, I didn&#039;t know if the u-boot issue was behind me, and hence the question.</p><p>Appreciate your help.</p><p>**EDIT** 2 other problems with lede are nslookups and dynamicDNS. I think once the nslookup issue is solved, it may fix the dynamicDNS issue.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davidc502</strong> on 15 Jun 2016, 21:59)</p>

It is my belief anyone with ACS hardware should stay away from any recent OpenWrt community build OR OpenWrt Trunk unless they they own or plan to buy a USB/TTL cable (I have put a warning on my website). If a user does flash, they can still use the system as there are no running problems - However they will find themselves locked into that image (Gui flash or sysupgrade will NOT work).</p><p>Though the step is as simple as flashing primary/secondary flash to Linksys Stock using USB/TTL, what isn&#039;t confirmed is if the latest lede image does OR does not re-introduce the problem. I may be able to either confirm or deny by trying to flash again, and I plan to do so over the next week (cross my fingers).</p><p>One other thing that comes to mind is that I just bought the ACS and flashed the latest snapshot image of Trunk, and found the problem. I have not corresponded with anyone else with ACS that has had the same problem. So, was this issue just related to my device? Unknown. Volunteers wanted <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Hope that helps.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not sure what&#039;s meant by KWB config files. The &quot;.kwb&quot; files are u-boot binaries that have a header set for booting from UART rather than NAND. The boot ROM on these devices can be switched into a mode on power-on where they accept an xmodem upload of the bootloader binary rather than trying to read it from flash.</p><p>In the unlikely event that you lose your bootloader on flash (which has happened before; just ask nitroshift) the device will appear to do nothing. But you can use this kwboot mechanism to load an u-boot image (such as the one nitroshift provided, which is only for Mamba) and from there write the u-boot NAND image to the u-boot partition on flash (on Linux that&#039;s mtd0).</p><p>You can also use kwboot to test new boot loaders, which is not really relevant on this hardware yet. It&#039;s been done a lot on Kirkwood boards, though.</p>									</div>

Also note except for the missing usb2 port bit I&#039;m not aware of a single issue with openwrt trunk. At least in regard to hardware support.
