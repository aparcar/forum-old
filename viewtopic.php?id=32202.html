					<p>I opened up my Buffalo AP and it uses those tiny little antenna connectors.&nbsp; I need to attach an external antenna to mine.&nbsp; Anyone know where I can find those connectors (preferably with a cable attached?)&nbsp; And what they may be called?</p>									</div>

					<p>Oh, you mean the ones on the PCB... Yes, these Hirose U.FL look about right.<br />Be careful, I quote: &quot;Female U.FL connectors are not designed with reconnection in mind, and they are only rated for a few reconnects before replacement is needed&quot;.</p><p>Here you can buy such a pigtail: <a href="http://gh.de/?in=&amp;fs=pigtail">http://gh.de/?in=&amp;fs=pigtail</a> (they have a UK page as well, just look for it)</p>									</div>

					<p>Turns out the Buffalo I have <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr-hp-g300h">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr-hp-g300h</a> has 3 of those on the mobo.&nbsp; Looks like there are 3 antennas, with the third being an internal strip with one of those U.Fl connectors.&nbsp; So I moved one of the rabbit ears to that one, and I will connect an external antenna.&nbsp; So far, no loss in performance - I can pick it up 70&#039; away through walls.&nbsp; I&#039;ll post back on the setup once I have it done.&nbsp; It&#039;s a mobile platform for streaming movies to my kids&#039; iPods and to a roku while we travel.</p>									</div>
