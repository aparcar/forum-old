					<p>Hi.</p><p>Recently, I got a feedback from the support team, that, in theory, I should have native IPv6 support. As I do not have or want the Speedport crap from Telekom, the support team can&#039;t give me further information, if my hardware is IPv6 capable. And this leads to the reason of my post.</p><p>I have a D-Link DSL-321B/DE as DSL modem. It is directly used as modem, say I configured the PPPoE stuff on my OpenWRT powered TP-Link TL-WR941ND. As far as I understand the procedure of connecting to the DSL service via PPPoE, all the IP negotiation stuff is done by OpenWRT. Is this right?</p><p>The IPv6 support is already working. I use the great Hurricane Electric and Sixxs tunnel broker services. My local devices get the IPv6 prefix from the HE routed network promoted via radvd and get working IPv6 connectivity. But I was not able to get a IPv6 from my ISP. If I am right with my guess above, has anybody&nbsp; already IPv6 from DT running?<br />Here is my current WAN config:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;wan&#039;
    option ifname &#039;wan&#039;
    option type &#039;bridge&#039;
    option proto &#039;pppoe&#039;
    option username &#039;&lt;my-account-id&gt;@t-online.de&#039;
    option password &#039;&lt;my-password&gt;&#039;
    option dns &#039;192.168.1.1 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4&#039;
    option ipv6 1
    option accept_ra 1
    option mtu 1452</code></pre></div><p>I still think, that IPv6 is not available for my account and the support guy simply had not a closer look on my contract. But before I re-open the ticket, I want to be sure and maybe my config lacks just a small bit.</p><p>Cheers,<br />Holger</p>									</div>

					<p>The ipv6-availability depends on your dsl-connection-type (take a look on your contract). There are &quot;isdn&quot;, &quot;standard&quot; (pots) and (in the meantime the barely new) &quot;ip&quot; (also known as ngn - next generation network - where everything concerning telephony gets handled via voip). At DTAG you get ipv6 connectivity <strong>only</strong> with dsl-connection-type IP.

					<p>Thanks, fabsle, for the reply. I read about this and this is why I asked the support when I will get IPv6. They mentioned, that I should already have it. After no success with OpenWRT and with my new Fritz!Box, I opened a trouble ticket. The technician checked my connection and said, that the previously given information was wrong. But DTAG will roll out IPv6 for all contracts during this year. We will see <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Well I dont think so, but I wish you all the best. (DTAG is announcing the ipv6 rollout for almost two years or more now...)</p>									</div>
