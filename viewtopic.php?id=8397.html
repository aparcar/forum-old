					<p>I have used RC5 since it was released, and the default settings was to download updates from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/packages">http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/packages</a>.<br />(The kernel I use is the default 2.4.30-brcm-3)</p><p>I upgraded the packages on all my routers last day (with ipgk upgrade), and then it installed some new kernel modules:<br /> kmod-brcm-wl_2.4.30-brcm-4_mipsel.ipk<br /> kmod-wlcompat_2.4.30-brcm-4_mipsel.ipk</p><p>These modules depends on the kernel 2.4.30-brcm-4 !, and they got installed anyway!?!<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># ipkg info kmod-brcm-wl | grep Depends
Depends: kernel (2.4.30-brcm-4)</code></pre></div><p>Those modules broke the wireless support, including the wds support and the devices could only be accessed with a normal network cable.</p><p>Are there any bugs in ipkg which makes it ignore the depending version?<br />I have changed my /etc/ipkg.conf to download packages from these urls until I upgrade to RC6 later...<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>src whiterussian http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/rc5/packages
