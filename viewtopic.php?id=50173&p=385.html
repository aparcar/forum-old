That caused no end of confusion with devices failing to connect for a while due to authentication problems then hopping back to the unit they could work with. Once I&#039;d tried disabling both 5Ghz and WMM Mode to try and get things to connect happily I finally turned off a unit and worked out that only 1 of them is taking Connections! </p><p>Sorry, long rambling post.

					<p>Stupid question, but I have to ask...&nbsp; If I want to build DD with the 4.4 FINAL kernel, do I need to modify &#039;include/kernel-version.mk&#039; ?&nbsp; Or, do I leave it as is and modify &#039;target/linux/mvebu/Makefile&#039; to build 4.4 ?&nbsp; Thanks.</p><p>Mike</p>									</div>

All of those re-sellers MUST go through Bell or Cogeco, and I can&#039;t see either of them allowing any re-seller to pretend that they are from a different country.&nbsp; The only other options are Cell networks or Satellite, neither of which are economical. Cell is trackable; Satellite may be the easiest to spoof.</p><p>So unless you can remove Canadian hardware from the loop, any router could have the capability built in to determine the country where you reside; Satellite excepted; if there is a modem in the loop.</p></blockquote></div><p>You are missing something</p><p>1. Only the modem knows what IP address the ISP gave it</p><p>1a. some ISPs give out 10.x or 192.168.x IP addresses</p><p>2. Trying to find out what IP address you have by connecting to a server on the Internet and asking it what IP address you connected from can be subverted via VPN setups.</p><p>So trying to enforce country codes based on what IP address you think you have on your WAN connection will not prevent people from lying to the AP if they think it will benefit them. I may make it harder, but it won&#039;t prevent them.</p><p>Your rant about having Canadian hardware in the loop is meaningless, the AP is not asking that hardware what IP addresses it has, and even if there was a standard way to figure out who to ask and how to ask, nothing would prevent some other equipment from responding instead of the Canadian hardware and lying to you.</p>									</div>

					<p>Just a observation... after about 5 days of uptime, I noticed wifi speeds drop off significantly. Example: Android S5 on 5Ghz had no issues pulling 100mbps on the ookla speed test. However after about 5 days, it was hard just to get 30mbps on the speedtest. </p><p>After a quick reboot, tests showed fast speeds like they were before. </p><p>This is on r48158 with .16 wifi driver.</p><p>Anyone else noticing this?&nbsp; BTW -- Nothing in the logs to indicate any problems.</p>									</div>
