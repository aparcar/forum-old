					<p>Hi there guys,</p><p>I&#039;ve documented how I&#039;ve created a CCTV hub here: <a href="http://natalian.org/archives/2012/08/29/OpenWRT_CCTV_project/">http://natalian.org/archives/2012/08/29 â€¦ V_project/</a></p><p>I was wondering if someone has done the same?</p><p>There is a couple of outstanding issues that you might be able to help with sync-cctv.sh script:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>if ! flock -n /var/lock/sync-cctv.lck -c &quot;rsync -a --remove-source-files /home/ycam/ ycam@remote-server:&quot;
then
    logger already syncing
fi</code></pre></div><p>1) The uploaded files are not &quot;quiescent&quot; for &quot;remove-source-files&quot;. Hence I&#039;ve noticed half an image get uploaded. Not sure how to do a post hook with FTP or something. Any ideas? Ideally the images were cached for sometime, but obviously do not exhaust the 4GB stick in there.<br />2) Uploading sometime saturates my 0.3M upload channel and makes my internet unstable. How to prevent that?</p>									</div>
