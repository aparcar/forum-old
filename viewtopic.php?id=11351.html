					<p>Hi</p><p>its been a couple of hundred revs since I built kamikaze for my wgt634u - just upgraded to recent version (7717) and I find that the BRCM_2.6 target system is gone!</p><p>what target system should I use to build kamikaze for netgear wgt634u?&nbsp; am trying with ATHEROS_2.6 (the netgear wgt634u uses an atheros chipset for wireless, but a broadcom SoC&nbsp; for processor ethernet, etc)&nbsp; to see what happens but any help would be appreciated!</p><p>Thanks</p><p>john</p>									</div>

					<p>sorry my problem</p><p>there was a conflict in trunk/target/linux/brcm47xx-2.6/config/default caused by my previously including some I2C SENSORS.<br />subversion couldnt reconcile these lines with the latest version so it created a file with both possibilities which was invalid to make menuconfig so the<br />brcm47xx_2.6 option went off the menus.</p><p>re-instated the correct default file into brcm47xx and we&#039;re back to normal</p><p>sorry for the scare!</p><p>John</p>									</div>
