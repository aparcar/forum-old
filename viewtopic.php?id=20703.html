					<p>Hi all!</p><p>I have recycled a bricked ZyXEL P-320W (yeah I know ZyXEL is not hacker-friendly but hey it was free), and I managed to restore the original firmware onto it (via TFTP).<br />I would now like to install OpenWrt (or any version of Linux actually but let&#039;s start here) on it.</p><p>However, I am not quite sure which architecture to select. The CPU has a cooler glued on, and I don&#039;t really want to take it off to read the part number...</p><p>From the wiki: <a href="http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs%282f%29Hardware%282f%29ZyXEL%282f%29P%282d%29320W.html?highlight=%28OpenWrtDocs/Hardware%29">http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs% â€¦ ardware%29</a> (note: this seems to be an old page as I cannot find any other references to this model elsewhere on the wiki)</p><p><strong>CPU:</strong> AMRISC 10100-G<br /><em>CPU is most likely a custom version of the RDC R8610 CPU.</em><br />4M flash &amp; 16M RAM</p><p>So I would need the RDC version from /kamikaze/8.09.1/rdc right? Also what is the difference with the *-web filesystem images?</p><p>And which method should I use to upload it? AFAIK the box speaks HTTP &amp; TFTP only (no telnet -.-). It has undocumented JTAG pins, but I lack the hardware to go down that road. Ie: how can I construct a bin/trx file from the bzImage &amp; filesystem? (Or how do I flash them onto the NOR without a debug port?)</p><br /><p>If someone here would be willing to spend a bit of time putting me on the right track I would be most grateful! I have extensive Linux knowledge and experience compiling/installing from scratch on embedded ARM, so it shouldn&#039;t be too painful <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> I just don&#039;t want to brick it again by flashing it with a firmware which won&#039;t run on it!</p><br /><p>Also I don&#039;t know if this is of any value, but the wireless chipset (not specified in wiki) bears the RaLink logo and reads:<br /><strong>RT2525L</strong><br />CV62990K0<br />0725ST<br />Random image which wickedly resembles it: <a href="http://www.ispreview.ru/pics/Hawking/pci_chip.jpg">http://www.ispreview.ru/pics/Hawking/pci_chip.jpg</a> (<a href="http://images.tomshardware.com/myimages/Features/linksys_outdoorap/wap54gpe_radio.png">other image</a>, consider only top half within metal enclosure)</p><br /><p>Thanks in advance, <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Thomas</p>									</div>
