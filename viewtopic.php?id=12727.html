					<p>Hallo,</p><p>I have a Asus WL500gP running Openwrt, and a separate dsl modem. <br />So far everything works, all boxes except the dsl modem get ip addresses from 192.168.11.0/24.<br />The dsl modem is normally also a router, but i disabled its routing functionality, allowing only dsl passthrough (to have openwrt call my provider with pppoe). <br />But, the dsl modem also has an ip address of 192.168.10.1. To connect from openwrt i just use the same virtual device, eth0.1, which is also used for the dsl passthrough. This works perfect, i can telnet from openwrt to this modem management interface. </p><p>Now my question is: How can i configure the openwrt firewall, to forward clients from the openwrt network (192.168.11.1) to get access to the modem?</p><p>I guess for some iptables guruz it&#039;s just a second of a thought, but i&#039;m now trying for 1.5 hours and still no luck...</p><br /><p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p><p>max</p><p>ps: except this &quot;ifconfig eth0.1 192.168.10.55&quot; i didn&#039;t configure anything different from the default so far...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>max2k5</strong> on 27 Sep 2007, 19:01)</p>

					<p>not sure that the rest of the iptables rules look like but you would need something like</p><p>iptables -{I|A} FORWARD -s 192.168.11.0/24 -i &lt;locallan interface&gt; -d 192.168.10.1/32 -o eth0.1 -j ACCEPT</p>									</div>

					<p>I think I have found a solution, though I have to check in the evening if it&#039;s really working.</p><p>I really didn&#039;t understand why it isn&#039;t working how it is now setup. </p><p>modem&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; router&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| client<br />-------------&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -----------------------&nbsp; ------------------<br />192.168.10.1&nbsp; | 192.168.10.55&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| 192.168.11.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | 192.168.11.77<br />-------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>When I ping from the client the modem, I get no reply. I thought, the router isn&#039;t forwarding the packet.<br />But in fact the problem is, that most likely the modem doesn&#039;t know how to send packets to the 192.168.11.0/24 network, because it doesn&#039;t have a default route set to the 192.168.10.55 address of the router. </p><p>So I think, I have to just enable NAT/Masquerading for the vlan address 192.168.10.55 on the router, so that all packets from my client to the modem will be seen at the modem as origination from 192.168.10.55.<br />This can be done by <br />iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0.1 -j MASQUERADE</p><p>Right?</p><p>I will check later...</p><br /><p>Thanks!<br />max</p><br /><p>Edit: Yup, this is it!

					<p>I can&#039;t get this to fully work in Kamikaze 7.06. I can ping the modem from the router after setting the WAN port IP on the router to match the modem&#039;s network. However, I can&#039;t find a proper masquerading iptables command. I tried:</p><p># iptables -t nat -I postrouting_rule -i eth0.1 -j MASQUERADE</p><p>I just guessed that POSTROUTING is replaced with postrouting_rule in kamikaze.</p><p>100% of my LAN machine&#039;s ping packets get lost, and the following shows that the rule isn&#039;t even being matched:</p><p># iptables -t nat -L postrouting_rule -v<br />Chain postrouting_rule (1 references)<br /> pkts bytes target&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;prot opt in&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;out&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;source&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;destination&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0 MASQUERADE&nbsp; all&nbsp; --&nbsp; eth0.1 any&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;anywhere&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;anywhere </p><p>Please let me know if you can tell what I need to know in order to be able to make this work.</p>									</div>

					<p>Oh, apparently, I had to do some forwarding too:<br />iptables -A forwarding_rule -d $MODEMIP -j ACCEPT<br />for example.</p>									</div>
