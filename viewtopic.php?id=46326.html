					<p>Hi,</p><p>I recently installed OpenWRT on my TP link WDR4300.</p><p>After I first installed it, it was working fine and I was able to log into the GUI config menu and enable wifi etc but after a restart, it stopped working. </p><p>I am now unable to connect the the router via ethernet and wifi. Both indicate &quot;unidentified network&quot; and I am not getting assigned an IP address and I can&#039;t ping the modem. This is happening on all the devices in the house including several windows laptops (running vista and 7), android tablets and smart phones and also Macbook Air.</p><p>I have tried manually assigning IP and winsock reset multiple times whilst connected via wifi and then via ethernet but neither worked.</p><p>I tried starting my router in failsafe mode and I can see the system light is flashing rapidly so it is definitely booting up fine but this seems to make no difference.</p><p>Ideally, I would like to do a factory reset but that doesn&#039;t seem to work either. Using the reset button on the rear of the device doesn&#039;t seem to do anything and I assume that is because of OpenWRT but I may be wrong.</p><p>If anybody could please help, it would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok so I am now able to ping the modem in failsafe mode via ethernet with a manually assigned IP address.</p><p>I still can&#039;t get into the configuration menu though. Is this disabled in failsafe mode? If so is there a way I can do a factory reset or return original firmware via SSH?</p>									</div>

					<p>in failsafe mode you can use telnet, to completely reset the device. or correct the mistake you made (if any).<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>FriedZombie</strong> on 17 Sep 2013, 11:28)</p>
