					<p>I am using a Linksys WRT54G v2.0, with firmware OpenWrt Kamikaze 7.09 (squashfs)<br />I changed the Network config and i set wan and lan config to DHCP bridged.</p><p>Now the router is not giving me any IP address (i dont now why), so i cannot connect to the router to reconfigure it.</p><p>I tried the failsafe thing, but after I press the reset button for 2 seconds when DMZ light is on, it does not seem to work. DMZ light never blinks 3 times and there is no way i can get into the router using failsafe. It seems like the reset button is not working.</p><p>I tried tftp, but the router is not getting the image. I set the computer address to 192.168.1.10 and i ping the router. After the reboot, the router gives me back a reply for the ping 1 time and then the ping is in timeout.</p><p>Timeout<br />Timeout<br />[router boots][DMZ light ON][sends the UDP package for pressing reset button]<br />ping reply from 192.168.1.1<br />Timeout<br />Timeout...</p><br /><p>The thing is...the router is not getting the tftp image. Maybe boot_wait was not enabled? I did not see the option to enable it when i upgraded the firmware...</p><br /><br /><p>Any help (besides CFE and JTAG) will be appreciated. Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, wiresharking the net i realize that the router was looking for a DHCP server inside the LAN...<br />I set up a DHCP server from my computer, I gave the router an IP and i could finally enter...</p><p>So this thread is solved (although i do not know why failsafe or tftp did not work)</p>									</div>
