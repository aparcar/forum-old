					<p>mctiew, </p><p>To be absolutely honest I haven&#039;t fully tested the multipath weighted approach, because I use the static one. But I see no reason for it not to work, since the inbound ssh connections will get processed by the interface that they game in. <br />As for the outbound the <a href="http://lartc.org/howto/lartc.rpdb.multiple-links.html#AEN298">http://lartc.org/howto/lartc.rpdb.multi … tml#AEN298</a> states, that this is not a perfect solution because of the caching. The decision which route to take is made on initial request to the host. Consequential request go over the same interface as the initial. As this is disadvantage in load balancing it is the opposite of the problem you are suggesting (assuming I got it right:) ). </p><p>Can you give more info on where do you see a problem? </p><p>In the meanwhile, I&#039;ll setup a weight multipath tonight and leave several ssh session opened for the night. I&#039;ll let you know the result in the morning.</p>									</div>

For example I&#039;ve used the 3th routing table (BG_ROUTES from the howto) to make sure the request to the DNS servers of my both providers goes via the proper interface (I don&#039;t have access to those machines, so they are not in the test;) ). <br />So you can have weighted multipath and still static routes for some hosts.</p>									</div>

You should read <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/NetworkInterfaces">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/NetworkInterfaces</a> as there is explained in much details. I&#039;m no expert, but this is how I see it:<br />Those device actually have one 5 port switch. To see them as diffrent interfaces in linux env we are using vlans. So by default: <br />vlan0 = LAN = ports 1 - 4 <br />vlan1 = WAN = port 0 <br />What I&#039;m doing is changing this to: <br />vlan0 = LAN = ports 2 - 4 <br />vlan1 = WAN = port 0 <br />vlan2 = WAN2 = port 1 </p><p>*5 port is some internal port, but I&#039;m not sure what exacly it represents. However it is a part of all vlans</p><p>The wifi is a hole diffrent interface (eth1 in my case), where you combine it with vlan0 using a bridge. <br />At first it was confucing to me also, but I&#039;ve played with &#039;nvram show | grep ?&#039; where ? = lan,wan,vlan,wifi,wlan to get the picture. And did some reading in the openwrt wiki. </p><p>Now the ordering of the ports may differ in devices. For example a few days ago I&#039;ve made my configuration to a WRT54GL v1.1 where I&#039;ve discovered that the settings ware: <br />vlan0 = LAN = ports 0 - 2 <br />vlan1 = WAN = port 4 (the port that reads WAN in the back of the device)<br />vlan2 = WAN2 = port 3 (the port that reads 1 in the back of the device)</p><p>nvram settings ware: <br />vlan0ports=&quot;0 1 2 5*&quot;<br />vlan1ports=&quot;4 5&quot;<br />vlan2ports=&quot;3 5&quot;</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>DeL3e7 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>from what i gathered is lukav is using the wan port and lan port 1 as 2nd wan bridge em both together?</p></blockquote></div><p>NO, I don&#039;t bridge them togather, what I do is separate lan port 1 as a diffrent interface and then use this as WAN2. </p><div class="quotebox"><cite>DeL3e7 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>well agian im confused as heck maybe some1 could dumb this down for me i was wondering about using the wifi interface as a 2ndWAN with the default wan port and sorta load balancing em, gotta admit this is heavy routing tables if you ask me, I&#039;ve been running on a linux machine for a few yrs now but this lil device with all its network devices and vlans etc makes my head spin, i maybe im too &quot;fresh&quot; to delving into such endeavorers all these nvram variables omg!</p></blockquote></div><p>Well, I did linux routing with ethX for a few years like you also. But I wanted to use this machine for other stuff and each time I rebooted the internet was stopping. That is why I&#039;ve invested in this small (I don&#039;t have much space at home) cheap device and had it do the job of the linux server. My linux configuration was the same except instead of vlans I&#039;ve had eths and each represented a network card (much clearer). </p><p>If you want to use the Wifi as WAN you&#039;ll have to separate it from the LAN bridge, - there is option for this in the WEB interface. Then you have to set wan2_ifname to the wifi device (may be eth1). <br />If you are not up for it, you can wait for the release of Kamikaze and then X-wrt to catch up with it, because I&#039;ve read somewhere that Kamikaze will support multiple WAN by default.</p>									</div>

And I don&#039;t have a second device to test nor I&#039;m planing to use my current one, because I use it too much and can not affort to brick it. </p><p>So, you could either give me access to your device or try to do this by forums or other type of communication (ICQ, GoogleTalk, MSN, Skype <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> ). </p><p>Lets start by giving some more information: <br />Which dist did you installed X-Wrt or plain OpenWRT?<br />Did you managed to separate the Wifi from the LAN and use it as client? </p><p>If so can you post the results from ifconfig,&nbsp; nvram show and anything other you consider relevant?<br />(Beware to mask any passwords when you post;) )</p><p>Regards</p>									</div>
