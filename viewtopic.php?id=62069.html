					<p>I am just now seeing that Netgear has released the R7500v2, which seems to have done away with the Quantenna solution on 5GHZ and has switch both radios over to a QCA based solution.</p><p>Sources:<br /><a href="https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Netgear_R7500v2">https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Netgear_R7500v2</a><br /><a href="http://www.snbforums.com/threads/netgear-r7500v2-r7800-r8500-have-shown-up.24717/">http://www.snbforums.com/threads/netgea … -up.24717/</a><br /><a href="http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/wireless/wireless-reviews/32899-netgear-r7500v2-nighthawk-x4-smart-wi-fi-router-reviewed">http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/wireless … r-reviewed</a></p><p>Radios:<br />QCA9880 3-stream 802.11ac for 2.4 GHz<br />QCA9980 4-stream 802.11ac MU-MIMO for 5GHZ</p><p>CPU:<br />Qualcomm dual-core IPQ8064 Internet Processor @ 1.4 GHz</p><p>Switch:<br />Qualcomm Atheros QCA8337</p><p>It appears the Router has also 512MB of internal RAM and 128MB Flash</p><p>Would it be feasible to think that OpenWRT could support this router? Seems very similar to the TP-Link C2600. Expect according to SNB, the TP link has a smaller 32MB flash (vs the 128MB of the R7500v2). And the C2600 uses the QCA9980 4-stream on the 2.4 band (vs the QCA9980 3-stream of the R7500v2), and is listed as having Skyworks Poweramps.</p><p>Thoughts? The CPU power of this router would be nice for those who wish to run a VPN client on the router.</p><p>Food for thought, the R7500v2 seems to be available at Wal-Mart in the U.S. for $149.00 currently.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cybrnook2002</strong> on 10 Jan 2016, 20:51)</p>

					<p>I bought one yesterday R7500v2. I had updated firmware to 1.0.2.2 , ppl complaints it is dropping connections, i have to test it yet.<br />I believe someone already flashed dd-wrt onto this router.&nbsp; I see VPN is there by default, i guess it is vpn server. still looking on how to setup vpn and use it.</p><p>I would like to know possibilites of open-wrt on this beast.</p>									</div>
