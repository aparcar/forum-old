					<p>I plan on following this guide</p><p>app.box.com/s/cispknq8b9zgog8k5vxn</p><p>for the WR703N to give it an external 6bi or 9dbi RP-SMA Antennae<br />I have never done soldering before but think I understand the basic but have a few questions</p><p>according to the guide I solder onto the coxial briad and centre conductor my U.fl IPX to RP-SMA Male Pigtail with the u.fl bit cut off, open the wire and remove the enamel around the wire.</p><p>are there two wires inside? Solder one to the coxial briad and one to centre conductor? what exactly are these soldering onto after ive cut the tracks? </p><p>Do I just put the soldering iron onto the wire which is on my solder point, or do i need a wire to act as the bridge between the wire and soldering point? what type of wire? </p><p>how big of a soldering iron? what would be good for such a small scale? <br />do i need flux for this? </p><p>please help elaborate on these issues, thank you lots!</p>									</div>

					<p>You can use that, but lead-free solder is preferable for modern stuff as it&#039;s better for the environment.</p><p>Make sure your coax is a Teflon (PTFE) insulated.&nbsp; &nbsp;This will withstand soldering heat better.&nbsp; It takes quite a bit of heat to solder the ground side.&nbsp; Much cheap coax is polyethylene insulated, and it will melt badly.</p>									</div>
