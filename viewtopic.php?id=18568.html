					<p>I am able to record sound using a USB sound card on OpenWRT. I&#039;m using kernel version 2.4 (because I want wireless to work on my broadcom-based device), and OSS drivers (not ALSA - they took up more space than OSS).</p><p>The program I&#039;m using to make the recording is called bplay, and I posted the necessary Makefile and patch to get it working. Here is the message to the dev list with that info: <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/openwrt-devel@lists.openwrt.org/msg02371.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/openwrt-dev â€¦ 02371.html</a></p><p>Hope that helps.<br />Dan</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve got myself the trial version of Adobe Audition 1.5 and picked up a logitech usb microphone from circuit city today. When I plug in my mic I can record audio from it using windows built in sound recorder. I then go to Audition to try it in there but it will not get audio from it. I selected the mic as the recording device and of course made sure it was setup in the control panel. I have checked the recording level and still have no luck. I&#039;ve googled and googled looking for an answer but no one seems to know if it works or not. I&#039;ve tried the adobe support forums and the same thing. there is no definitive answer on whether or not it will work. I hope it does because it has a nice long cord that goes all the way in the back behind my desk and has good sound.</p><p>If some one can let me know if they got it work and if so how I&#039;d appreciate it. Thanks.</p>									</div>
