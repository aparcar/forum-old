					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am trying to change the setup of OpenVPN on my systems. I have an idea of what I would like to do but no idea of how to do it...<br />On the most basic level I have been using OpenVPN for 3 years using a Windows PC as the sever and Windows PC&#039;s as clients. The connection is set to route all traffic through the tunnel to provide me with internet access through my home network provider.</p><p>Now I also have many mobile devices that I would like to connect to my home network but there is no OpenVPN client for them. I would also like to maintain access to the local network on the WNDR3700.</p><p>Would it be possible to connect the WNDR3700 to the Windows OpenVPN machine but route all VPN traffic through a virtual lan such that the DHCP on the OpenVPN PC would assign to local Wifi clients? In other words having WIFI X connected to the TAP device?</p><p>Also I have tried a simple VPN connection to the server using the WNDR3700 but can not seem to translate the Windows client configuration into the config GUI. Is it best to configure manually?</p><p>I have a reasonable amount of experience with routing, linux and OpenWRT but I would really like to avoid breaking my network access.</p><p>As another option if simpler I could run the server side of OpenVPN on a virtual OpenWRT machine on the PC. Is there a VMware/Virtualbox/Hyper-V VM that can be downloaded? </p><p>Any ideas or comments would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>John</p>									</div>

					<p>I was hoping to carry on using the Windows OpenVPN server. If it is not possible to use the Window OpenVPN server I would prefer to use a lightweight low memory OS in a VM so as the Windows machine can carry on doing what it is configured to do.</p><p>Should setting up the router at the remote location as I would like work?</p>									</div>
