					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I see from this thread ( <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=44704">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=44704</a> ) that spock managed to get into the 2760 over telnet / ssh as part of trying to figure out how to use OpenWRT on this device. I can&#039;t seem to do this (the username and password I use for the web GUI don&#039;t seem to work at either telnet or SSH ports). </p><p>Spock, if you&#039;re out there, what is the username and password for this console access?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
