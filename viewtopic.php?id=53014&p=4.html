					<p>Thanks for the very prompt reply. I&#039;ve broken the &#039;built in&#039; bridging between LAN and WAN, reset the firewall rules appropriately (I think) and basically followed all the steps I followed to get this working successfully in BB on the TP-Link device. I&#039;m not getting as far as the OpenVPN installation and configuration stage, as I&#039;m getting stalled when obtaining a DHCP lease on the WAN interface. I&#039;ll try a hard reset and start again from scratch - I just wanted to be sure I wasn&#039;t missing some essential patch or package. I&#039;ll keep you posted.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>TravelingMan</strong> on 2 Feb 2015, 09:16)</p>

					<p>Hi</p><p>I have loaded the r42649.&nbsp; The upgrade appeared to have gone fine, however I can not get internet or the LAN. </p><p>My primary router is 192.168.1.1 and it&#039;s AP is 192.168.11.1 with it&#039;s own guest LAN at 192.168.3.1.&nbsp; The guest LAN has it&#039;s own DHCP.&nbsp; The AP&#039;s 192.168.11.1 does not do DHCP, but gets IP from the router.

					<p>I just want to thank <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/profile.php?id=134347">wingspinner</a> for all his great work getting openwrt to work on the TM-02. I was looking for a way to serve my 2TB ext4 formatted portable hard drive to my Android tablet running <a href="http://kodi.tv/">Kodi/XBMC</a> over nfs while travelling. Note that Android <a href="http://kodi.tv/">Kodi/XBMC</a> supports <a href="http://kodi.wiki/view/NFS">nfs</a> natively so you don&#039;t heed to root your tablet. <br /></p><ul><li><p>I connect my 2TB ext4 formatted portable USB hard drive to the TM-02</p></li><li><p>I connect my battery pack to the TM-02</p></li><li><p>I connect the Android Tablet to the TM-02 wireless access point</p></li></ul><p>I don&#039;t need an Internet connection for this.</p><p>I was able to get <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/nfs.server">nfs</a> working on OpenWrt by simply installing the nfs-kernel-server package. I did not have to alter any firewall rules. By default, the nfs-kernel-server package exports /mnt. I had to export the usb hard drive mount point, on my OpenWrt configuration, /mnt/sda1 instead. Otherwise, I would get an access denied. </p><p>Thanks to everyone that worked on this!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vernonjvs</strong> on 23 Feb 2015, 10:50)</p>
