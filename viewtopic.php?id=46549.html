					<p>I bought recently an HAME A! clone at Amazon, just named &quot;3G Wi-Fi Router&quot;, without any additional brand name.</p><p>The Image-Name (from the boot message) points to an chinese company, called ZLMNet, with an chinese-only homepage: <a href="http://zlmnet.com/">http://zlmnet.com/</a></p><p>I posted pictures from the PCB as well as the original bootlog into the Wiki: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/zlmnet/mifif10n">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/zlmnet/mifif10n</a></p><p>Unfortunately I am not able, to get openwrt installed on that device.&nbsp; When I go through the very simple webfrontend, I get a nice javascript enabled progress bar, when I try to upload an open-wrt image.<br />However, already immediately after start of the upload, I see the following message on the serial console:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>No suitable usb disk partition found 
.nvram_set Needrestoredefault 1
sleep 3 &amp;&amp; reboot &amp;
starting pid 2579, tty &#039;&#039;: &#039;/etc_ro/rcH&#039;
The system is going down NOW!
Sending SIGTERM to all processes
syslogd exiting
Requesting system reboot
Restarting system.</code></pre></div><p>and all previous configuration is gone, as the device reboots with default settings.<br />The progress-bar continues during that reboot and&nbsp; states success after two minutes ;-)</p><br /><p>So, next try is TFTP via the U-BOOT boot-loader. There I see already some mismatch:</p><p>While booting, i get the message:<br /><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>U-Boot 1.1.3</strong> (Jul&nbsp; 8 2013 - 10:59:04)</em> <br />followed by<br /><em>Ralink UBoot <strong>Version: 3.6.0.0</strong></em><br />during the boot-process</p><br /><p>I prepared an TFTP-Server on a linux box, connected the MiFi F1 with an crossover cable direct to that box, having as well an dhcpd running.&nbsp; Each time, the box boots regulary, it receives an IP address from the Linux-Server and I am able to login.</p><p>When I try to TFTP however, there is complete silence on that network.&nbsp; The physical link is up, as soon, as the MiFi F1 is powered up, however I see no packages at all arriving.&nbsp; I watched the observed the connection from the linux end with tcpdump, not a single packet arrives!</p><p>That brought me to another finding:</p><p>When the MiFi F1 is booted, the devices look like:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>br0       Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 2C:67:FB:5D:10:68

					<p>So I have exactly the same problem and have not yet been able to find a solution for this. I also tried loading an image through kermit via loadb, but this just timeouts.
