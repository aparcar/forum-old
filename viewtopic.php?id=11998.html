					<p>I had this same error recently on 0.9, so basically this is what I did:</p><p>I found mod_status.so in some other folder and created a symbolic link to it in the /usr/lib/ folder.<br />This also happened for mod_rewrite.so, mod_auth.so, etc. so you may want to find out where the <br />original file is.</p>									</div>
