					<p>Hello,</p><p>in the past I used to build (for backup and reflash purposes) my own trx-file on a WRT54GL on Kamikaze 7.09 with the following commands:</p><br /><p>mount -o remount,ro /dev/mtdblock/4 /jffs<br />dd if=/dev/mtdblock/1 &gt; /tmp/wrt-linux.trx<br />mount -o remount,rw /dev/mtdblock/4 /jffs</p><p>Now a WRT160NL with Attitude Adjustment (bleeding edge, r28310) this doesn&#039; work anymore, I guess the flash layout is different and perhaps something<br />chaned in the os. I couldn&#039;t find any infos anywhere, could somebody perhaps give me a hint in the right direction? Do I have to backup several mtdblocks and cat<br />them together in one file??</p><p>Thanks,<br />JimmyJim</p>									</div>
