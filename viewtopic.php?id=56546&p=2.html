					<p>Yeah, sorry, completely misunderstood that article - the intent in that article appears to be from getting multicast traffic to get to the wireless interface completely.</p><p>Having said that, would IGMP&#039;s contribution to latency over and above what latency 802.11 itself introduces be statisticslly significant?</p><p>I&#039;m quite curious about what&#039;s involved in &quot;fixing&quot; this, but unfortunately still don&#039;t have any real way of doing suitable tests in my home lab.</p>									</div>

					<p>my testing seems to be showing that 802.11n seems to be allowing a rate set at 54Mb/s.. but multicast packets are still going ONLY at 6Mb/s.. even when we&#039;ve set basic and supported rates at say, 54Mb/s..

					<p>Pretty sure basic_rate works on ath9k in the 2.4 Ghz band... see the screengrabs of the spectrum analysis I did at the start of this thread.</p><p>Note that I&#039;ve only tested on ath9k; the settings might or might not work on other radios.&nbsp; ath9k is 802.11n-only, so if you&#039;re 802.11ac capable I&#039;m pretty sure at least your 5 Ghz radio is something else.&nbsp; (Also keep in mind that with 5 Ghz, the default - and lowest possible - basic rate is 6 Mbps.&nbsp; in 2.4 Ghz, it&#039;s 1 Mbps.)</p><p>See the following for examples of others&#039; experience with ath10k, where they seemingly encountered problems too:<br />* <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=58106">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=58106</a><br />* <a href="http://lists.shmoo.com/pipermail/hostap/2015-March/032250.html">http://lists.shmoo.com/pipermail/hostap â€¦ 32250.html</a></p>									</div>

					<p>This article is great to me, as I am not familiar with mac80211 driver, I think I can learn a more little with this article and make use of your test result. Thank you.</p>									</div>
