					<p>Well, initially I put the image and the rootfs on the flash card, along with the script to load them into the flash chip on board.<br />Now I am doing all from tftp.<br />Then<br />1) I download the image and the rootfs via tftp at boot time (Redboot), and I created correctly the two partition (kernel and rootfs)<br />1&#039;) I load the image and the roots into the flash chip on board. And then go -n xxxxxxx<br />2) I see the prompt from OpenWRT<br />3) I cannot see any cfa2 device in /dev</p><p>So, what I am missing?</p><p>My objective is <br />1) At very first boot, let RedBoot download the image and the rootfs. Create the partition into the flash chips and load the image and the rootfs into the partitions.<br />2) Since at the next reboot, I have not to re-create the partiotions (otherwise I will lose data), I would create a script into the flash card which only load the image and the rootfs into memory. Is it right?</p><p>Any reply will really very appreciated</p>									</div>
