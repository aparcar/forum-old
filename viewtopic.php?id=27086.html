					<p>After receiving some more help from stinel at #openwrt, I&#039;ve now learned that the change for norway has to be entered in <a href="http://wireless.kernel.org/download/wireless-regdb/">wireless-regdb</a>.</p><p>I&#039;ve made the following changes and generated a new regulatory.bin based on the current information on <a href="http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?hl=no&amp;sl=no&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.lovdata.no/for/sf/sd/xd-20090602-0580.html&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;usg=ALkJrhhGbQPtCjONnilyHdAgh1NwIZhFVA#7">FOR 2009-06-02 nr 580</a>:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>country NO:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (2400 - 2483.5 @ 40), (N/A, 20)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (5150 - 5350 @ 40), (N/A, 23)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (5470 - 5725 @ 40), (N/A, 27), DFS</p></blockquote></div><p>This gives me the ability to use the eight lower channels in 5 GHz frequency range that doesn&#039;t require DFS.</p><p>The only remaining annoyance is with the TX power, when I check &quot;iw list&quot;, it says the maximum TX power for all my available channels are 20 dBm although &quot;iw get reg&quot; says 23 dBm, and wireless.radio1.txpower=27.</p><p><strong>Question 1</strong>:<br />Is this happening because I&#039;ve created my own unsigned regulatory.bin? or is there TX power limit in the hardware or driver?</p><p><strong>Question 2</strong>:<br />If possible, where do I see the hardware/software TX power limit?</p><p>So in the mean time, I&#039;ll better do like other ath9k users out there on the interwebs: Start <a href="http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers/ath9k/todo#DFS">waiting for DFS</a> (gives me 10 more channels) and TPC (let me increase TX power on the 5470 -&gt; 5725 MHz frequency range from 27 dBm to 30 dBm)</p>									</div>
