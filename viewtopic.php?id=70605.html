					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;m in the process of starting a small ISP and I see the benefit in using a managed router for our customers.&nbsp; It would allow us a lot of flexibility to help customers when they call in for issues.&nbsp; </p><p>I&#039;ve dabbled a bit with openwrt, but I&#039;m far from an expert... so I&#039;m looking to see if openwrt would work in this situation.</p><p>My (semi flexible) requirements are:</p><p>- Easily sourced robust router<br />- relatively affordable to buy in 25-100 unit batches<br />- has VOIP / rj-11 jacks for phones<br />- supports TR-069</p><p>Is openwrt a viable solution?&nbsp; </p><p>So far there isn&#039;t a ton of options in this area, but one suggested option was the Cambium R200</p>									</div>

					<p>Have you tried wiki&#039;s table of hardware both at OpenWrt and LEDE Project wikis? Quite a few people poured their soul and sweat into it, it might have information you&#039;re looking for.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stangri</strong> on 15 Apr 2017, 01:03)</p>
