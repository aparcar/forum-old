					<p>I&#039;ve always included all my packages/libraries in the build, never selecting loadable module.<br />But I&#039;m currently having some issues with my bluetooth modules so I want to run them as loadable to see if I can get them to play nicer.<br />When I do select M when building, where do the modules go? I don&#039;t see anything in the bin folder after the make.</p><p>I realize its probably a stupid question, but its just something I&#039;ve never needed before and am unsure of how it works.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

dest root /                     
dest ram /tmp                   
lists_dir ext /var/opkg-lists   
option overlay_root /overlay</code></pre></div>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 8 Aug 2011, 21:27)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the help guys.<br />I got my loadable modules as directed by your assistance.<br />Unfortunately it didn&#039;t solve my problems.<br />I was hoping that either loading them in a different order, or by not loading some, might alleviate the problems I was having but they exist still.</p><p>Once again thanks, and lets consider this inquiry solved. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I&#039;m actually happy this didn&#039;t work. Considering the excellent OpenWrt build system and the fact that I have 8mb flash, I never really wanted to have to go down the &quot;loadable module&quot; path anyways.</p>									</div>
