					<p>Hi,</p><p>I used OpenWRT with a good results with two routers (WRT54GL and WL-500gP) but now I&#039;m stuck with a problem I cannot resolve and need some help from someone smarter <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />.</p><p>In one of cases the ISP provides access through pointopoint ethernet connection. Currently there is a linux box working as a gateway. This is how I enable connection:</p><p>ifconfig eth0.1 add $MY_PUBLIC_IP -pointopoint $MY_PUBLIC_IP dstaddr $ISP_ROUTER_LOCAL_IP up</p><p>as this works well with linux box, it doesn&#039;t work with openWRT unfortunately. It is weird as usually just after enabling eth0.1 I can ping $ISP_ROUTER_LOCAL_IP for 10 pings after it drops connection. Sometimes when I restart the interface is works again, sometimes not - looks like more or less random behavoiur.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried white russian 0.9 and kamikaze 7.09 both with brcm-2.4 and brcm47-2.6 images. I&#039;ve got similar behaviour with all.</p><p>Can anyone give me any clue how to make it working? Is this a bug or I&#039;ve just forgot something? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p><p>I can provide more details and run some tests if you need more info - just tell me what to do <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />.</p><p>TIA</p><p>/mjn</p>									</div>
