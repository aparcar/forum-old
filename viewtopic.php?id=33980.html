					<p>Cheers for the reply, that works fantastic but I wish there was a guide for non Unix users as I have spent hours trying to get the wireless to work as it constantly says it is not assigned to anything or not started when as far as I know it is assigned to wan and neither wireless will work.&nbsp; I have also been trying to find an area for port forwarding so I can use it for whs 2011 but that is nowhere to be found...is it called something else?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>I believe it&#039;d be under Network-&gt;Firewall, then you&#039;ll see &quot;Redirections&quot; in the middle of that screen. Add as many as you like. You&#039;ll need to select TCP or UDP or both and which port it uses and what internal IP you want it forwarded to. I haven&#039;t actually set it up, but from looking at the interface, that is what you&#039;re looking for.</p>									</div>
