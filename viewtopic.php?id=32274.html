					<p>Hi</p><p>I&#039;ve been testing this router with Backfire r28299. It&#039;s been difficult to install it but finally it worked. </p><p>I&#039;ve followed the instructions from here:</p><p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/file/8a3kws628j8b5u0/Mod_Dir-615_E5_5.11BR.zip">www.mediafire.com/file/8a3kws628j8b5u0/Mod_Dir-615_E5_5.11BR.zip</a></p><p>That i saw in this DD-Wrt forum:</p><p><a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=602363">http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=602363</a></p><p>BUT instead of upgrading with all the images mentioned there, i just used the first two, and then the openwrt image compiled by me. I don&#039;t understand why i had to upgrade the Router with those 2 images, but when tryed with others (including openwrt&#039;s and other original images) it didn&#039;t worked.</p><p>And there&#039;s another thing. I used the D-Link Dir 600 A1 target profile, like in E3 and E4 versions, but it didn&#039;t work at first, so i noticed that in the original images for E5 (and in the images from dd-wrt forum) the signature of the bin file was located at a different position compared with the one of openwrt for dir 600 A1, so i changed the bin file to match the others, and finally worked.</p>									</div>
