					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to get gmediaserver to work on my WGT634u running Kamakaze (r8511). I notice from earlier posts that the magic files aren&#039;t installed by default and so I&#039;ve tried two sets, one from Linux and anyother from MacOsX but with no joy.</p><p>I still get an error in the log file saying that it can&#039;t recognise the file type (MP3) of any of my files.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>2007-09-08 20:14   Found regular file `03 When You\&#039;re Falling.mp3&#039;
2007-09-08 20:14     Matched no type
2007-09-08 20:14     Skipping (file type excluded)</code></pre></div><p>Please would someone with a working gmediaserver install suggest where I can get a working set of magic files?</p><br /><p>Thanks.</p><p>Andy.</p>									</div>
