					<p>Greetings fellow Open WRT users. First off let me tell you a funny story:<br />I&#039;ve got a Linksys WRT54GL v11 which I just bought new today. After installing the kernel 2-4 firmware I tried to install the kernel 2-6 version but unfortunately it didn&#039;t work (Error 512) via the webinterface. So I just forcefully installed it using tftp .. I then started configuring and then something happened which I cannot explain until now: connection to the router got lost and I couldn&#039;t connect anymore (ping returned by ethernet adapter). So I cut off power and booted the router again and still the same thing. So I used the failsafe mode and connected via telnet to find out that I don&#039;t know much about the config files ... I also didn&#039;t really know what could have caused it. I just made some general internet settings but nothing that could have prevented me from accessing the router (I also tried wireless too).&nbsp; Furthermore I had ping when booting the router so it was clear that there was a problem with the config. Because I couldn&#039;t figure out what the problem was I just thought that I would start from scratch and cleaned the nvram (although there was warning but my device wasn&#039;t mentioned and.. most times there are too many warnings <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />). Unfortunately this didn&#039;t help at all in getting access... still the some picture. <br />Conclusively I used firstboot to delete settings which succeeded. So I could connect again and started changing some settings again (all was lost after all). But then the same thing happened again (definitely not related to configuring imo) and I basically repeated the same things again. Only problem this time was that it didn&#039;t work. Router just didn&#039;t boot anymore at all.. I only had flickering power light and all other connection lights glowing which is bricked. I switched on / off like 10 times to be sure that it&#039;s not something memory related and also tried taking power off for a longer period of time (1 min). But nothing helped and I got really frustrated <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /> So I just put it off power and switched it on again after 10min and surprisingly it booted normally ... So then I could use failsafe mode again.. guessing that all the problems came from first forcefully installing the kernel-2.6 driver I now used mtd to revert to kernel-2.4. After that I installed kernel-2.6 package again and that&#039;s basically my status at the moment.</p><p>tl dr: i fucked around with the router thinking i bricked it and got 2.6 kernel installed with difficulties <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>1. What could be the reasons for kernel-2.6 firmware getting the error while installing via web interface --&gt; can i provide any more infos on this so you can help?<br />2. What could be the reason for the problem with just not being able to connect to the router (no ping after booting!)<br />3. How is it explainable that after waiting some time router went from bricked to normal again.. i thought nvram data wouldn&#039;t get lost if power is down?! <br />4. Setting up wifi using web interface does not work (no message or sth.) and using ssh and config (disable = 0) I still don&#039;t get signal with iwlist ..? <br />5. I didn&#039;t find the wiki article for wrt54gl very orderly in terms of finding what you are looking for --&gt; imo lots of outdated stuff (kernel 2.4). Is there another guide, probably more comprehensive?</p><p>Thanks in advance for answers and even more thanks if you read everything.</p>									</div>
