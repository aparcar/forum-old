					<p>I&#039;ve been wanting to upgrade my router for sometime now, and I&#039;ve previously attempted to install OpenWRT on my router. It resulted in a semi-brick, which I fixed using the Asus&nbsp; Firmware Recovery utility. My router is an Asus WL-500gp V2, and I have a few questions to ask..</p><p>- Is there a bootloader of some sort I can use? One that can act as a failsafe that will allow me to recover my router?</p><p>- The way I flashed my router last time was doing it through an SSH session. I had a firmware image downloaded onto the flash memory, and then I used a command I think was called &quot;write&quot;(I forget since it&#039;s been a whole month). Would TFTP be the best method for this?</p><p>- If I compile an OpenWRT image myself, is there any specific way to doing it other than entering in &quot;make kernelconfig&quot; in the sources directory?</p><p>- How would I include X-WRT packages within my OpenWRT image?</p><p>That&#039;s all :S. I just don&#039;t want to go bricking my router again. Normally, I&#039;m the adventurous type but this is an exception. Thanks!</p>									</div>
