					<p>Hi,<br />I have already read the posts in this forum telling about OpenWrt issues dealing with adsl routers.<br />I would like to buy an adsl router/access point to use with OpenWrt, but according to the <a href="http://toh.openwrt.org">table of hardware</a> and some posts I read on this forum, it sounds like there aren&#039;t devices completely supported in which OpenWrt is stable. Are they?<br />In particular I read about DG834v2, which is a very nice device, but should still have some issues with OpenWrt.<br />Any advice is appreciated.<br />Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have used OpenWrt (but not heavily) on some AR7s (DG834v2 is an AR7) and I have in general not had a problem, except for wireless.&nbsp; On older versions of trunk I have got wireless to work, but current versions hang the router as soon as the module is inserted.</p><p>I have not had a problem with ADSL on the router, but as I said I have not used it heavily.</p><p>If you want to use wireless, though, I would not suggest an AR7, since the acx wireless driver is not stable yet.&nbsp; (Of course some people seem to get it to work <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi ggp81,<br />I was also looking for a xDSL/AP hardware compatible with openwrt but I think I will just use my old AP/modem as a modem and buy a new compatible AP and use them together.<br />I think I&#039;ll buy the WL-500g Premium.</p><p>cheers</p>									</div>

					<p>Tex-Twil:<br />I also think I will do as you, but I would be happy to use only one device with OpenWrt installed.<br />I think I will wait OpenWrt to be mature to correctly run on those devices.</p><p>So everybody&#039;s experience about ADSL devices are still appreciated.<br />Thanks very much</p>									</div>
