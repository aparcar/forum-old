					<p>Does anyone know how to clear out files from an incomplete install of a package?</p><p>For example my router has very little space in flash to begin with, I try to install a package and it turns out there isn&#039;t enough space but after a reboot my free space is still sitting at 16kb instead of the 228kB I had free before.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried opkg remove &quot;package name&quot; but since it didn&#039;t actually install this does nothing and just says no packages were removed.</p><p>Anyone else run into this? I&#039;m sure that since we&#039;re all working with such limited space this has to be at least a somewhat common problem.</p><p>TIA</p>									</div>

					<p>Forgive my ignorance, how do I find out the list of files it created? I can&#039;t seem to find any options in opkg that would do this?</p><p>I&#039;m positive it was due to the new package install because I saw how much space I had before the attempted install and then the remaining space afterwards, its the only process that was ran that would have taken up space.</p><p>As for more details I apologize, I&#039;m not sure what else to add, if there is anything specific that would help please let me know and I&#039;ll include it.</p><p>A factory reset or firmware re-install would of course work however I was leaving that as a last resort and I wanted to find a solution to this if I ran into it again in the future.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
