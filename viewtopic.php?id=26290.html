					<p>Hi.<br />I&#039;m trying to do this on my house.

					<p>connect the ethernet cable from a LAN-port of routerA to a LAN-port of routerB&nbsp; (just bridge the router together, no need for routing!) <br />to disable firewall and the dhcp server just run <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/etc/init.d/firewall disable
/etc/init.d/dnsmasq disable</code></pre></div><p>open /etc/config/network and set the LAN-Interface to dhcp or set a static IP in the same subnet as RouterA and add the IP of RouterA as DNS-Server and Gateway<br />like that: <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#### LAN configuration

If you have the same SSID and WPA-password the client will connect to the strongest signal, or reconnect to the strongest if the connect is lost. So if you don&#039;t move your client up/down-stairs while it&#039;s online there shouldn&#039;t be a problem.<br />Some chipsets (wifi-client) have some features which allow some kind of &quot;roaming&quot;. madwifi-driver can do &quot;background-scanning&quot; to find the same SSID on different channels, and switch to the better signal before the connection is lost. But the client has to authenticate on the new AP again, so it not really roaming.&nbsp; <br />If you really want to try roaming install wpad (not wpad-mini) and try configuring IAAP (Inter Access Point Protocol) in hostapd.conf but I&#039;m not sure how it should work, and if it&#039;s implemented on openwrt.</p>									</div>

And simpler to do<br />- Configuring time, hostname, luci, etc and extra packages or features of OpenWRT is omitted here<br />- Everything works very easily by this way. Almost no configuration needed.<br />- Both routers have same SSID on different channels. This makes roaming possible if client/server supports it and its simpler for clients to connect automatically to strongest router</p>									</div>
