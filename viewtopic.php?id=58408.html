					<p>What is the best way to phisically disable a wifi antenna? (Like the antennas on the NEXX)</p><p>1 for security. to be 100% sure that there is no way to communicate wirelessly to the NEXX<br />2 to remove e-smog from the airwaves. <br />3 to hide the device <br />4 etc. :-)</p><p>I just noticed that the stock firmware from the nexx has a setting to reduce transmit power, BUT that doesn&#039;t seem to do the trick (So i hope openWRT does it better)&nbsp; With&nbsp; power all the way to 0 and saving the setting and rebooting the NEXX is still reachable over wifi...</p>									</div>

					<p>As they posted you, disable wifi, by default a fresh flash has wifi disable<br /> and with OpenWrt you can lower the power, I don&#039;t really understand your goal, but that will do.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks&nbsp; yoyellow and danymarc</p><p>The goals:</p><p>In my case the NEXX is a cheap little device that can turn a HDD into a NAS, but i wanted to keep if out of the wifi domain. <br />I also have in mind to disable the wifi from and other NAS box, just to be sure that there is no way to get it&#039;s data crippled by WiFi script kiddies etc. thus hacking the electronics if there isn&#039;t a wrt flash available for it.</p><p>And then i can be 100% sure that wifi will be turned on accidentally (or on purpose by someone for whatever reason) This way it is possible to build a reasonable cheap yet&nbsp; sufficient secure LAN (not connected to the web or outside world) even with a crap router if nothing else is available.</p><p>So depending on the situation the NEXX could be used in a LAN without new firmware. But yea, that doesn&#039;t make sense when you have OpenWRT. </p><p>So i&#039;m still interested in info how to disable a wifi antenna with a soldering iron. :-)&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>On top of that there are ever more wifi devices clogging up the bandwidth, so why not disable a few that are just taking up space (and cooking our meat, hehe)</p><p>I&#039;ve seen that some of the German Fritzboxes have an external button to toggle the wifi on or off.&nbsp; I think that would be a very nice feature to have in OpenWRT.&nbsp; Read out a GPIO pin and toggle wifi on and off on the GPIO signal.</p>									</div>

					<p>I just bumped into thisone:</p><p>I think it would be nice to have this in the wiki. and hosted on the openwrt site so it cant get lost.</p><p><a href="http://www.anz.ru/files/mediatek/MT7620_Datasheet.pdf">http://www.anz.ru/files/mediatek/MT7620_Datasheet.pdf</a></p><p>i hoped to find some reference schematics for the wifi transmitter here...&nbsp; &nbsp;but unfortunately i have to continue that search.</p>									</div>

					<p>Indeed!&nbsp; Thanks,</p><p>Hmm I hope I can get my head around that, I&#039;m still more at ease with a solder iron . :-) <br />I&#039;m wondering though, if the software is not installed is the radio then also OFF? Or will the radio still be on with a silent channel?&nbsp; (thus still demanding radio bandwith)</p>									</div>
