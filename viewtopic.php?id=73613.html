					<p>I am currently trying to find out the pinout for jtag on my router. I am wondering if there are any tricks in particular to find the pinout, and whether or not messing up the signals could damage the router. I am also wondering if any special precautions need to be taken as my router has gpio that goes to about 2.6v. Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>That&#039;s the issue. I&#039;ve already checked out that page, and the device I&#039;m using has a non standard 8 pin (2 x 4) interface. I have for the most part figured out what each one is. I&#039;m just wondering if there is a way to make sure they are correct as I manually traced them from the soc, and whether or not special care has to be taken as the interface is only at 2.6v on the pins.</p>									</div>
