					<p>I have been building recently my images with dnsmasq-dhcpv6 just to be &quot;future ready&quot; though I never used DHCPv6 services on my network, but now I am no longer sure it actually makes any sense with 6relayd coming with DHCPv6 support as well.</p><p>I understand there could be only one DHCP(v6) authority so what is the recommended approach (or foreseen evolution) regarding those two modules? Are they supposed to coexist? Or is 6relayd going to replace DHCPv6 functionality of dnsmasq-dhcpv6?</p>									</div>

					<p>There is no coexistence. You can use either one to your liking. The size of both features is nearly identical.</p><p>6relayd is better integrated into OpenWrt (picks up prefixes automatically and so on, has webui-support) and provides some additional features like Prefix Delegation server and NDP-proxying and / or DHCPv6 relaying. It is also integrated by default in trunk.</p><p>dnsmasq-dhcpv6 needs to be configured manually, doesn&#039;t support Prefix Delegation or proxying but can provide an additional feature called ra-names for hostname detection and is a little bit more customizable.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>CyrusFF</strong> on 14 Jul 2013, 12:44)</p>

					<p>Ok, so I will revert back to dnsmasq (plain) and give a try to 6relayd <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />. Thanks for clarification.</p>									</div>
