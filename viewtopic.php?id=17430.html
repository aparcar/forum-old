					<p>I&#039;ve worked for several years now with the venerable Linksys WRT54G/GL and have installed OpenWRT-based firmware in well over 100 routers in AP mode.&nbsp; But I&#039;m still using WhiteRussian because of the Broadcom wireless driver issue with Kamikaze.&nbsp; (Even this site&#039;s name contains the letters WRT, illustrating the long history these Linksys boxes have had here.)</p><p>I have followed the discussions here closely.&nbsp; One observation is that the Kamikaze driver support for Atheros-based routers seems solid (at least more solid than the B43 driver for Broadcom).</p><p>So, it is time to move forward and retire my long association with the WRT54G/GL.&nbsp; I would like to find an Atheros-based router that is considered main-stream, is reasonably economical, has an excellent track record in the field, and works solidly with Kamikaze.</p><p>Right now I&#039;m studying the supported devices list, looking for supported Atheros-based routers.&nbsp; In addition to this research, I would welcome any recommendations for an Atheros-based router that could become the next WRT54G/GL (in popularity, price, reliability).</p><p>Thanks very much,<br />Bill</p>									</div>

					<p>Unless you have a need to move to the 2.6.x kernel, I&#039;d recommend playing around with the brcm-2.4 Kamikaze releases if you have yet to do so.</p>									</div>
