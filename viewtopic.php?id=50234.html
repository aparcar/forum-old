					<p>Hi<br />I try to upgrade new firmware from Luci web page because it is easy, I think.<br />What I did was I choose the .bin upgradable file under &#039;Flash new firmware image&#039; and press &#039;flash image&#039; button. But not successful. <br />Error message said <br />&quot;The uploaded image file does not contain a supported format. Make sure that you choose the generic image format for your platform.&quot;</p><p>I checked how to upgrade wiki page and information is not up to date and not relevant to my situation.</p><p>How to convert to supported format?</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks gentlemen for response.</p><p>My router is WR710n and I flash with openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr710n-v1-squashfs-factory.bin<br />and try to upgrade with openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wa701n-v1-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin</p><p>I noticed that I have 2 file of openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr710n-v1-squashfs-factory.bin<br />They have same name but different size (8M and 4M). I don&#039;t know why, when I put them in the same folder, it did not override. (Normally folder will not accept same file name).</p><p>And my firmware is r40462 and kennel version is 3.10.34.&nbsp; I got them form Luci web page.</p><p>Today I try to upgrade again and same result.</p><p>I try to upgrade because I cannot install some packages like kmod-usb-acm</p>									</div>
