					<p>I would like to use mjpg-streamer on my TL-WR1043ND router together with a Logitech C920 full HD webcam. The problem is that if I specify the 1920x1080 resolution the router just dies and reboots. I suspect that it is a out of memory issue. </p><p>I tried another router, the d-link DIR-825, with more memory. With the that router I was successful to start and stream. Looking at the memory consumption using mjpeg-streamer it was roughly about 36 MByte - more than TL-WR1043ND even has. Then I tried fswebcam and it used &quot;only&quot; 18-22 Mbyte (it seems to peak at 22 while taking a picture e.g doesn&#039;t allocate all memory at once???). </p><p>Looking at the sources for both mjpg-streamer and fswebcam I noticed that they both allocate 4 memory mapped image buffers. And in 16 bit (YUYV palette) 1920x1080 these four buffers make up a total of around 16 Mbyte. Looking more into the sources of fswebcam it has a read option (fswebcam -R) that doesn&#039;t seem to allocate so much memory at all (should be around 4 Mbyte). The problem is that the read option isn&#039;t available in openwrt. Currently the tp-link router has only about 10 MByte free RAM.</p><p>So, to the questions:</p><p>* Can I free about 10 MByte ram so that I can use fswebcam directly?<br />* Has anyone compiled the most recent version of fswebcam? And, is the read option available for the v4l2 in openwrt?<br />* Is there another snapshot program in the package lists (that uses less memory)?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am struggling with the same issue. A similar crash happens when I try to do h264 streaming with the webcam using gstreamer. Not sure how much memory that needs. I do, however, have a 16MB swap space on a USB stick, so I did not expect memory crashes.</p><p>Any news on this issue for you?</p><p>My setup:<br />TP-Link TL-WR703N with USB stick extroot setup<br />MJPEG-streamer r148-3 from opkg<br />Openwrt Trunk (Attitude Adjustment) r32130</p><p>Thanks<br />pragtich</p>									</div>

I have a cheap USB webcam set on my TP-Link MR3220 (almost the same hw parameters) and if mjpg-streamer is set to stream VGA,5fps the CPU is hitting 100%.<br />Decreasing the frame rate to 3fps on the same resolution it stays around 55%. Setting the resolution to QVGA allows me to increase the frame rate to around 15-20 fps.</p><p>So, I advise you to try with a much lower resolution and sample rate and check the current load. Simply the Video decoding and streaming is not the purpose of these router&#039;s CPUs.</p>									</div>

					<p>First off, I solved the problem by upgrade the memory to 64Mbyte. </p><div class="quotebox"><cite>dir2cas wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>So, I advise you to try with a much lower resolution and sample rate and check the current load.
