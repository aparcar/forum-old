					<p>And if you assign ip address and netmask manually does router respond to ping? Default IP address is 192.168.1.1/24. If not, try using failsafe mode. Did it work after flashing? Was this situation caused by you playing with settings or maybe just went wrong during flashing?</p>									</div>

					<p>Depending on what date you downloaded this, you may need a serial cable to revive the router. There was a bad build on Aug. 25th.<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/12079">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/12079</a></p>									</div>
