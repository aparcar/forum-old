					<p>Hello Everyone,</p><p>I&#039;ve been running OpenDNS on a static IP at home for years without issue. I recently purchased a new Linksys WRT1900acs V2 and installed OpenWRT. I&#039;ve configured OpenWRT to use OpenDNS and it will test successfully at opendns.com/welcome but if I go back to opendns.com/welcome 15 minutes later it fails. One minute it&#039;s blocking adult content, the next it&#039;s not....this happens consistently over any period of time.</p><p>Does anyone have an idea what might cause that random behavior?</p><p>Any help is appreciated. Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>I believe I&#039;ve discovered the problem.....after posting on the OpenDNS forum and submitting a ticket to OpenDNS I believe it&#039;s the IPv6 settings in OpenWRT that are causing this problem OpenDNS.</p><p>On my 3 year old D-Link router running it&#039;s original firmware I can replicate and resolve the problem by switching the IPv6 connection to &quot;Local Connection Only&quot;.</p><p>Is there equivalent switch in OpenWRT&#039;s IPv6 functionality?</p><p>Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.</p>									</div>
