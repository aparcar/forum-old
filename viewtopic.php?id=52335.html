					<p>I am having troubles when I install new FW on my router Netgear WNDR 3700v2. My ISP remembers last used device and when I connect a new one like when I flash new FW the router does not get and IP from my ISP. I need to release the IP before I flash new FW but I do not know how to do that. Any1 could post here how to release and renew IP throught concsole/buysbox?</p>									</div>

					<p>You can do &quot;ifdown eth1 &amp;&amp; ifup eth1&quot; to respawn udhcpc. Sounds strange to me though, your MAC address doesn&#039;t change after flashing a new firmware, so you should be able to get an IP. Maybe it&#039;s an idea to do a tcpdump on eth1 while renewing to see if there&#039;s anything fishing going on.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah it is strange really. The only FW that is working is Gargoyle. This is the last FW that I had and was working before I started flashing your builds, CeroWRT and stock trunk OpenWRT. None of them gets IP from my ISP. Even with the same MAC address used. I don&#039;t know what else to do.</p>									</div>
