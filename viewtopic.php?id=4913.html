					<p>Hi,<br />I have this relaying problem that I cannot resolve. After hours of testing the situation doesn&#039;t change, my router does not relay dhcp.</p><p>OK, I installed OpenWRT FS version for my Buffalo WHR54S. Everything went well DHCP assigns an IP from our servers pool but that&#039;s not good enought. My router should resolve ip from specific DHCP-server. Then I installed this DHCP-forwarder and configured it but no change - the ip is reassigned from wrong pool and an error occured when starting dhcp-fwd process &quot;ioctl(): Cannot assign requested address&quot; &quot;Can not get interface information&quot;</p><p>Which processes I have to kill before this works. dnsmasq, udhcpc???? Can anyone help? The ideal situation is that my lan interface gets that DHCP -address transparently.</p>									</div>
