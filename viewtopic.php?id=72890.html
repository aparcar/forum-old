					<p>That &quot;radio disabled&quot; message is because you have not yet enabled the wifi radio.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t have anything to do with pppoe.</p><p>If pppoe has connected successfully, <strong>ifconfig</strong> will show there is a pppoe-wan interface with your public IP address.&nbsp; The <strong>logread</strong> command can be used to see log messages including those from the pppoe driver.</p><p>network restart does more than network reload.&nbsp; It pretty much cold-starts everything network related and should be used to try connecting again.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the quick reply. </p><p>Unfortunately there is no&nbsp; such interface.<br />I tried logread but the logs doesn&#039;t tell me much because I&#039;m not sure what&#039;s what.</p><p>I also tried restart but it didn&#039;t changed anything. <br />Probably I misconfigured something by the pppoe but I have no idea what.</p>									</div>

					<p>Switch to a release build such as this one.&nbsp; It includes the web interface.<br /><a href="https://downloads.lede-project.org/releases/17.01.4/targets/ar71xx/generic/lede-17.01.4-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr842n-v2-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin">https://downloads.lede-project.org/rele … pgrade.bin</a><br />You can also use the older OpenWrt build here:<br /><a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05.1/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-15.05.1-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr842n-v2-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal … pgrade.bin</a><br />though I recommend the LEDE one.<br />Download the bin to your PC then scp it to the router&#039;s /tmp directory.&nbsp; &nbsp;Log in to the router, <strong>cd /tmp</strong>, and run <strong>sysupgrade -n</strong> on the file.&nbsp; The -n option will remove any configs and give you a clean start.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 31 Dec 2017, 23:11)</p>
