					<p>Hi,</p><p>I got an WNDR3700 with GBit ethernet and an USB port. The stick has a speed of about 30 MB/s.</p><p>I wanted to load the stick as a net drive from a Windows 7 pc. When I connect via any ssh technology (scp, sshfs, sftp) then I only get transfer rates at about 2.5 MB/s. I was expecting something in the region of 20 - 30 MB/s.<br />Are my expectations off the scale or am I just using the wrong technology?<br />What would be the way to go here, to reach those speeds and get a drive that behaves like a local drive?<br />Regarding &quot;behavior&quot; I was very pleased with sshfs, because it really let me do everything, like starting .exe setup files directly from teh drive and so on. But it is slow and I think needs to preload.</p><p>Does anyone have some experience?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>well I think I didn&#039;t make this topic appealing enough for others to contribute to this topic. So here I go and give a heads up of what I found out or have achieved so far.</p><p>I thought splitting the problem in 3 parts might lead to the solution:</p><p>1. Checking the USB drive read and write speed.<br />2. Checking the network connection speed.<br />3. Checking the CPU demands of various transfer protocols/techniques.</p><p>I have finished the first point now.</p><p>I tested read and write speeds with</p><p>time dd bs=1M count=100 if=/dev/zero of=testfile</p><p>and respectively</p><p>time dd bs=1M if=testfile of=/dev/null .</p><p>This showed that from the start I had read speeds of about 30 MB/s, which is exactly what it should have.<br />But write speed was at 2.5 MB/s. After a week of tinkering and browsing the internet I found out, that this slow write speed is a general linux problem with USB2.0 and that there is not ONE SINGLE solution to it. Everyone does sometheing else and then it somehow automagically works, or not!<br />In my case, I checked that the drive was mounted with the async option and it was. What did the trick for me was one of the following things I did, but I don&#039;t know which one it was:<br />- repartitioning the drive (not formatting). fdisk -l showed some ID or something saying dos or windows or something. I thought this was strange. I deleted the partition table and created a new primary partition.<br />- removing the dos compatibility flag. Also with fdisk.<br />- formatting the the with ext3.</p><p>Then I mounted the drive and woohoo!, I also had around 30 MB/s write speed.</p><p>The CPU usage while writing or reading with 30 MB/s is around 30% on the WNDR3700.</p><p>So there are still (almost) 70% left.</p><p>So I think, that in the end, what one can achieve with the net drive regarding transfer speed might be limited by the cpu. So after checking raw network speed for anything awkward I&#039;ll try sshfs/sftp first and check out the new speed. But I think it will at best hit 5 MB/s at 100% cpu.</p><p>Thank you for reading. I hope I helped someone who&#039;s experiencing USB drive write speed problems.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>xelra</strong> on 28 Jul 2010, 10:30)</p>

					<p>I have dd-wrt on my 3700, installed optware and samba 3.0.24.&nbsp; I am able to hit 14 megs/sec upload and download to my wired in desktop.&nbsp; wireless is much less at like 4-5 megs but i think thats the nature of wireless transfers.</p><p>ftp should also be a good thing to try.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for your replies.</p><p>Yes, in this case it is really interesting to also see, what you achieve with other firmwares.</p><p>I have setup vsftpd and tested ftp speed yesterday. I could read at aruond 21-25 MB/s. But writing was another chapter. It seemed like it also would have been able to write at the same speed, but somehow after every 10 or 20 MB it would stop, wait a bit, and then resume the transfer with high speed.<br />If I have to guess what that is, then I am saying it is the ftp protocol itself. I think I have read somewhere that files go to memory before writing and that you might run out of memory with ftp. Something like that. That would explain the stops.</p><p>So writing for me was between 0 - 25 MB/s with ftp.</p><p>Maybe I&#039;ll try creating some swap.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you use encrypted protocols like sftp, scp, ftp over ssh you will never be able to reach 20-30 MByte/sec, because the cpu will have to do all the en- and decryption.<br />My ancient WGT634U is limited to about 1,5 MByte/sec using unencrypted protocols, so your performance is not that bad.</p><p>If you want top performance you should use a model with sufficient hw-crypto support, or switch to a desktop cpu with enough cpu power, maybe a core i3 or even a core i5 with hardware AES support?</p>									</div>

					<p>No sync activated. Actually I specifically mounted with the async option and I have to say: WTF! Why the hell does it not show the async option when I type mount? That is very confusing. Anyway, no sync.</p><p>I think I&#039;ll figure out if the &quot;write-interruption&quot; thing is connected to ftp if I just try samba and nfs. If something similar happens, then I know that it needs further investigation.</p><p>After doing some reading on the internet I won&#039;t install swap on the drive, because it seems that it will not only destroy the drive, but also have no effect and slow down the system.</p><p>I might also try aligning the filesystem on the usb drive. This should benefit the drive speed, the drive life time and decrease the effects on the cpu usage, because on average it should only do 2/3 the amount of r/w processes for the same amount of data. So maybe I end up with only 20% cpu usage for raw writing and reading, leaving open more for the actual network transfer.</p><p>@MMCM: Yes, I can confirm. With all SSH technologies I only achieve something between 1,5 to 3 MB/s. dropbear process maxes out the cpu usage. That&#039;s the limit. I think SSH is just not the technology for high speed network transfer on ANY hardware, regardsless of its performance.</p>									</div>
