					<p>I believe that you can place the single wireless radio into client mode (sta) and then use it your single wan gateway.&nbsp; However, it can be kinda tricky to do this successfully while not getting locked out of the box. You&#039;ll have to edit the network, wireless, and firewall sections of the /etc/config/ Refer to the wiki. </p><br /><p>Also if you want use multiple wans youll have to have multiple wireless boxes feeding into multiwan router using vlans to seperate the wans which all require different subnets.&nbsp; Heres a topology of my setup.</p><br /><p>Wireless 1&nbsp; &nbsp; Wireless 2&nbsp; Wireless3<br />x.x.0.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; x.x.1.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; x.x.2.1<br />&nbsp; | |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| |<br />|------------------------------------------|<br />| eth1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; eth0.2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;eth0.3&nbsp; |<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />|3700v2 Multiwan,vlan,vpn,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />|------------------------------------------|</p><br /><p>This affords load balancing ~ 3x the speed and failover and is a stable solution. <br />It certainly wasn&#039;t easy but works pretty well masking the wireless connections instability.&nbsp; &nbsp;Tell us more about the hardware you have available.&nbsp; It may be best to pick up some cheep compatible routers to use as wan the gateways.&nbsp; </p><p>Another idea would be to get multiple usb wireless adapters and use those on the single router.&nbsp; That would be awesome if someone could successfully to that.</p>									</div>
