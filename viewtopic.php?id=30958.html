					<p>HaloO,</p><p>I have a TP-Link TL-WR741ND with a fresh install of r27340 because this was<br />indicated in the supported hardware list. This worked fine but I had to install<br />LuCI through opkg. It wasn&#039;t pre-installed. Then I tried to configure the network.<br />I gave the same IP to the wan and lan interfaces. Thereafter I could not log in<br />and had to boot failsafe and have run the firstboot command to get a fresh start.<br />So far so bad.</p><p>What I want to achieve is a configuration with a DSL-Router as the prime host.<br />E.g. it hands out IP numbers via DHCP. It should have IP 192.168.1.1. The<br />TP-Link should have 192.168.1.3 on all interfaces if this is possible. The idea<br />is to use it as a bridge on the ethernet/WLAN level. But all hosts have IPs<br />from the 192.168.1.0 net. Is this possible? How do I use the interfaces in such<br />a setup?</p><p>Many thanks in advance for help, glurks.</p>									</div>

					<p>HaloO fyi,</p><p>thanks for your patience. I&#039;ve tried the HT40+ option but this causes the<br />WLAN to stay down. So I&#039;ve tried HT40.

					<p>HaloO fyi,</p><p>I have sucessfully configured a second wlan and a guest interface on 10.0.0.1<br />with a dhcp server handing out ips in this net. But it is not possible at all to reach<br />the internet from there. I&#039;ve tried it with the following entry for the firewall:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;zone&#039;
        option &#039;name&#039; &#039;guest&#039;
        option &#039;network&#039; &#039;guest&#039;
        option &#039;input&#039; &#039;ACCEPT&#039;
        option &#039;output&#039; &#039;ACCEPT&#039;
        option &#039;forward&#039; &#039;ACCEPT&#039;
        option &#039;masq&#039; &#039;1&#039;
        option &#039;mtu_fix&#039; &#039;1&#039;

config &#039;forwarding&#039;
        option &#039;src&#039; &#039;lan&#039;
        option &#039;dest&#039; &#039;guest&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Before I go into restricting access to the lan it should be possible to get through to<br />the internet in the first place. Note that I have connected the router with IP<br />192.168.1.3 to my linux host with 192.168.1.2 which uses a dsl connection on<br />interface ppp0 to reach the internet. Eventually I will switch over to an external<br />router on 192.168.1.1. Could it be that my host is not routing the packages from<br />the guest net? But I hoped they were masqueraded as 192.168.1.3 packets by the<br />router and hence should work the same as the WLAN that is connected to 192.168.1.3<br />in bridge mode with eth0 and eth1. This can reach the internet.</p><p>Unfortunately the only tests I can run are with an ipod. I can reach the web interface<br />of the router under the 10.0.0.1 or 192.168.1.3 address. I have no webserver on my<br />linux host.</p><p>Regards, glurks.</p>									</div>

					<p>HaloO,</p><p>I hope I&#039;m not considered a hopeless case. But I don&#039;t understand why I don&#039;t get<br />the guest WLAN connected to the internet.</p><p>I see the following error on my host<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Aug  1 11:09:50 edgar kernel: [  382.473583] martian source 17.250.237.43 from 10.0.0.209, on dev eth0</code></pre></div><p>The IP 10.0.0.209 is an assigned DHCP number on the guest net. So I conclude that the masquerading<br />doesn&#039;t work because the 10.0.0.209 should be translated to 192.168.1.3.</p><p>BTW, I fear that there is a lot of stuff in the iptables that I don&#039;t need. Where exactly is the link from the<br />/etc/config/firewall file to the iptables. When I do a &#039;iptables -n -L&#039; I see lots of chains. Some of them<br />have guest in their name. But how do I check that they do NAT? Here are some hopefully relevant parts:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># iptables -t nat -n -L POSTROUTING

MASQUERADE  all  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0</code></pre></div><p>This looks promising but doesn&#039;t work. So what should I do?</p><p>In need of help, glurks.</p>									</div>
