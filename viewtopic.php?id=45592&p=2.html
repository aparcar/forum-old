					<p>Today, I&#039;m undertaking development for the WNDR4700. I am swamped with competing projects, but I hope to get a boot-from-SATA build going this month. It may still be just a Kamikaze variant, but... we&#039;ll see.</p><p>First, though, I should mention that (I believe) the labels of the serial pins tx/rx are transposed in the wiki picture (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr4700#serial">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr4700#serial</a>). Ground and Vcc are correctly labeled, but Receive is next to Gnd and Transmit is adjacent Vcc.</p><p>Regards</p>									</div>

					<p>Finally got hold of this Router/NAS 18 months later after release on a fire sale price...</p><p>I plan to replace both good old trusty TP-LINK TL-WR1043ND (OpenWRT+Gargoyle) and D-LINK DNS-323 (Alt-F+ffp) at the same time.</p><p>The default firmware from NETGEAR is minimal in features but satisfactory for the moment: has wild-card domain filtering, monthly bandwidth cap controls, wi-fi scheduling, which are hard to find (all) on modern routers. On the NAS side, the NTFS support is a huge plus (although I&#039;ve giving up Apple Time Machine support on NTFS) and the gigabit reading speed is wickedly fast at 70-90 MBytes/S.</p><p>I will be missing these features from OpenWRT:<br />- OpenVPN.<br />- Detailed web usage and web search monitoring.</p><p>I will be missing these features from Alt-F:<br />- BitTorrent client.<br />- Newsbin client.</p><p>A few more additional features specific to the CENTRIA:<br />- Provide hard drive inactivity spin-down timer.<br />- Temperature driven fan speed control.</p><p>Now then... getting started with the NETGEAR provided source code for their firmware and heading off to the newbie section for OpenWRT development...</p>									</div>

					<p>Don&#039;t know if anyone with skillz would want to work out a loan on one of these? I&#039;ve got one of these collecting dust until it gets some usable fw,&nbsp; and well if I just gave it away my interest in it&#039;s firmware drops considerably. I&#039;d pay to ship (usa) also the internal sata is??? I&#039;ve only tried my ancient sam spinpoint f1 (1998) but it chokes on it, all the front lights flash a few times then the router reboots, not sure if it&#039;s fw related or not. But if anyone interested I&#039;ll scavenge a decent drive&nbsp; and recheck it since internal sata is the big selling point on this..</p>									</div>
