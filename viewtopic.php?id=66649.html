					<p>I don&#039;t disagree... Heck, I bought my first 1900ac V1 that was advertised as &quot;refurbished&quot;, but only to find out, someone put trunk openwrt, and didn&#039;t know hot to install LuCi, so they sent it back... Was i perfect working order otherwise. </p><p>There have been several post here about people who have bought brand new routers, only to send it back because they couldn&#039;t get OpenWrt working like they wanted. I agree, why should the manu have to eat those costs? However, over-all sales for those who support third party firmware, may be quite a bit higher, and easily off-set those costs. Speculation on my part, but a thought.</p>									</div>
