					<p>Hi,</p><p>i have some questions regarding my project to use my newly bought TP-Link TL-MR3020 as an WISP router for using public hotspots while beeing automaticly connected to a (private) VPN network with all devices using the re-distributet network by the MR3020. <br />But i have some problems with this.</p><p>The first one is this:<br />When I use the MR3020 to connect to a existing WiFi-network (in this case my own Home-Guest-Network) and then spanning its own WiFi network which redistributes the connection to my HomeNetwork to other devices, it all works good. But in the case I disactivate my WiFi-homenetwork by switching it off in the home-Router the MR3020 will also disactivate its own redistributet WiFi-network, which leads to the fact that i cannot reach its configuration-page anymore.</p><br /><p>This is not what I like it to do. I&#039;d like to have the &quot;MR3020&quot;-network <strong>always</strong> enabled/distributet, even if the MR3020 is not connected to a &quot;Host&quot;-network. Because otherwise I would not be able to re-configure the MR3020 to use another WiFi/Hotspot-Network when i&#039;m on the go. </p><p>What do I have to do in the configuration to enable the MR3020-WiFi-network <strong>ALL</strong> the time it&#039;s switched on? (regardless the configured &quot;WAN-Host-WiFi&quot; is within range or not)</p><br /><br /><p>And my second problem is regarding the VPN.<br />Sice the MR3020 doesn&#039;t have much space to install other software/plugins to OpenWRT, the possibilities are limited (it has only about one megabyte in space for adding new packages).<br />Actually i have only 260.00 KB left.<br />I have installed OpenWRT Attitude Adjustment 12.09 with LuCI 0.11.1 installed<br />The Model is a TP-Link TL-MR3020 v1&nbsp; (it&#039;s brand new bought)</p><p>On the MR3020 I have installed these packages:<br />strongswan&nbsp; in Version 5.1.3-1<br />and<br />strongswan-mod-uci in Version 5.1.3-1</p><br /><p>I thougt I would be able to configure the needed IPsec VPN (my Router Needs VPN) on the device now by using LuCI?<br />But where can i find the setup-page of this VPN?<br />Or isn&#039;t it enough to just install the &quot;strongswan-mod-uci&quot;?&nbsp; &nbsp;Do I have to do further things?</p><p>Connecting by SSH? How do I activate the Strongswan LuCI configuration-page then?&nbsp; Or is there no possibility to configure strongswan by LuCI?</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p><p>Best Regards, <br />SchwarzerRiese</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>SchwarzerRiese</strong> on 23 Sep 2014, 01:54)</p>
