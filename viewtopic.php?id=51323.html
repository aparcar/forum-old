					<p>I&#039;d like to configure OpenWRT router for below network setup. There will be 3 subnets (eth*) and two devices (gateway and openwrt). Both devices will be connected via cat6 ethernet cable and should send all traffic between the two using cable.</p><p>[device-g]:[ADSL GATEWAY] BUT_ALSO [WiFi AP] -&gt; [device-wrt]<br />* Receives all internet out-bound traffic (as gateway) &lt;- from [device-wrt]:wan0<br />* Routes all incoming VPN ports to server -&gt; [device-w]:wan0<br />++ As Wifi AP, Routes all eth1 (subnet1) traffic to [device-wrt]:eth1 (these are authorized LAN clients)<br />++ As Wifi AP, Routes all eth2 (subnet2) traffic to [device-wrt]:eth2 (these are WiFi guests)</p><p>[device-wrt]:[OWRT + Wifi + RADIUS + DNSMASQ + VPN_gate]<br />eth0/wan0= (WAN: outbound to gateway and listening VPN server)<br />eth1= (LAN-trusted: cabled &amp; Wifi devices, can talk to each other) <br />eth2= (WAN-guest: Wifi-only internet clients - pass through [device-wrt]:dnsmasq then forward traffic to gateway)</p><p>Q1: How many interfaces must I create? 3 or 6 (3 + vpn + 2xWifi)?<br />Q2: The interfaces must be bridged I assume? Which ifaces to what?<br />Q3: The gateway will not handle any traffic between subnets. All of that will be done by the OpenWRT device. How do I define the gateway for each subnet? How is DNS name server defined for all subnets in dnsmasq?</p><p>I use FreeBSD and some linux ways are foreign to me. Thanks for our time and comments.</p>									</div>

					<p>None of your description makes any sense to me, I cannot understand what on earth you are trying to describe. Plus you are referring to devices you don&#039;t mention and then putting the same device in multiple places?</p><p>It&#039;d be better if you just drew a picture of what devices you have, and how you want them connected.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi. In that case I&#039;ll try to tackle each problem in different stages. First off, description of what I already have - two devices:</p><p>* [device-wrt] is a TPlink-WR1043ND-v1.x, with OpenWRT already installed. Uses radius to authenticate all Wifi requests. Dnsmasq is not configured correctly because I could not set the &quot;gateway&quot; or &quot;default router&quot; variable, so all internet traffic gets cut off.<br />* [device-g] is an ADSL modem (gateway) that also has one Wifi antenna (Airties 5341 I think). Unsupported by any *wrt, so native firmware will remain on this. Wifi capability is used as A/P and auth is configured as radius, forwarded to device-wrt.<br />* subnet1: The two devices above are connected by cat6 cable. The cabled lan has several PC&#039;s and printer. There are also mobile Wifi devices on this &quot;trusted lan&quot;. All clients are allowed to communicate with one another on this subnet. All internet traffic from clients must be forwarded to &quot;default router&quot; which is [device-g] the adsl modem.</p><p>The Problem:<br />* For subnet1, I just need to get dnsmasq working so it can start acting as name server and specify the gateway IP in dhcp correctly.<br />* Subnet2: I&#039;d like to provide internet access for visitors (maximum security, Wifi-only). None of the visitors should be able to access the &quot;trusted lan&quot; and the internet-bound traffic should be filtered through dnsmasq. This should be the case for Wifi connections from [device-g] A/P as well.</p><p>If it&#039;s acceptable with you, I&#039;ll expand on the other points once we get this section clarified.</p><p>Thanks and Regards.</p>									</div>

					<p>From what you wrote I figured this out:</p><p>www ---- non-openwrt gateway ---- openwrt router (VPN termination + WAN forwarding + DHCP server/ forwarder?)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;WLAN&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; WLAN&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;WLAN&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; WLAN<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; trusted&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; guests&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;trusted&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;guests<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LAN&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LAN</p><p>At first glance I would say a bit &#039;risky&#039; design as you need to (port) forward WAN traffic into LAN. Do you separate traffic between devices with tagged VLANs and different subnets? Otherwise I would expect that the WAN can see LAN traffic of the WLAN. Do you completely forward the WAN traffic to openwrt router?</p><p>When using RADIUS for client authentication, do you forward DHCP requests to separate RADIUS server? Are you using 802.1x for client permissions or do you want to filter traffic at the firewall?</p><p>...Maybe better if we could see the config or part of it.</p><p>Regards</p><p>Schlamassl</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi schlmassl,</p><p>Just to make sure I was able to describe what the current setup is,<br />a) No VPN service is provided as yet<br />b) No internet available for visitors<br />So only &quot;trusted lan&quot; clients are being served, and they must have internet access. Right now, there is only one subnet. The other subnets I described are for &quot;what I would like to setup, if that&#039;s possible&quot;. Schematically the current setup:</p><p>www<br /> |<br />_________________<br />device-g: non-openwrt ADSL gateway @ 192.168.1.1/24<br />DHCP server &amp; DNS forwarding (I plan to disable this)<br />Wifi A/P for WLAN to the 192.168.1.0/24 network<br />Cabled connection to 192.168.1.0/24 network<br />_________________<br />&nbsp; |<br />|Dumb Eth Switch, no Wifi|---cat6---|PC, printer on 192.168.1.0/24|<br />&nbsp; |<br />_________________<br />device-wrt: openwrt router @ 192.168.1.2/24<br />Radius Auth server using 802.1x<br />Wifi A/P for WLAN to the 192.168.1.0/24 network<br />Cabled connection to 192.168.1.0/24 network<br />Dnsmasq needs to be setup for DHCP + DNS cache + DNSSEC<br />_________________<br />&nbsp; |<br />Another PC via cat6 on 192.168.1.0/24</p><p>As stated, I&#039;m actually asking about the other two subnets so I can understand if such a thing is possible. Also, I can&#039;t claim to be &quot;entirely sure&quot; of what I want since there are most likely points which I have overlooked. that said, re your questions,</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>You need to forward WAN traffic into LAN. Do you separate traffic between devices with tagged VLANs and different subnets</p></blockquote></div><p>Yes, that&#039;s what I was thinking. I would have a separate dnsmasq configuration for the unsecure subnet.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Do you completely forward the WAN traffic to openwrt router?</p></blockquote></div><p>No, just radius, dhcp and nameserver. Rest of the traffic exits from the shortest path.</p><p>I realized while writing this answer that the gateway A/P only has one antenna. This probably means that device would only be able to serve a single Wifi subnet right? I mean, does each Wifi subnet require a separate antenna? If so, it means that guests can only access internet from the WR1043ND (has 3 antennas)</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>When using RADIUS for client authentication, do you forward DHCP requests to separate RADIUS server.</p></blockquote></div><p>Do you mean dnsmasq for the DHCP requests? Is there a security disadvantage doing it this way? I definitely do not want to run a mysql on the box.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>...Maybe better if we could see the config or part of it.</p></blockquote></div><p>In the setup I currently have, not much configuring has been done, with the exception of the Radius server - and even that is setup as user/pw only (no certs) and no database.</p><p>I hope I was a little clearer this time <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p><p>Thanks for the help.</p>									</div>

					<p>You&#039;re better off just using a standard guest wifi setup:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan</a></p><p>Alternatively/potentially if your ISP router supports it you could also setup a second guest WLAN there.

You could post your current one so we can see what&#039;s wrong, however it&#039;s mostly per-interface and interface specific anyway.
