					<p>The short answer: None of them.</p><p>SPI refers to the peripheral bus used to connect the flash chip into the microcontroller unit. It has very little to do with NAND, which is a technology used to implement the flash memory chip itself; the other prominent technology being NOR.</p><p>WPQ864 has both NOR and NAND flash (see <a href="https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Compex_WPQ864">this</a> and <a href="https://www.compex.com.sg/product/wpq864/">this</a>). The files that you have generated are for the AP148 development board, which is a completely different <a href="https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Compex_AP148">unit</a>. </p><p>AP148 has the same SoC, equal amount of flash memory and RAM, but that&#039;s where the similarities end. Looking at the hardware specs, I wouldn&#039;t use the AP148 images on a WPQ864 board.</p><p>To build OpenWRT for WPQ864, I recommend you <a href="https://www.compex.com.sg/contact-us/">get in touch with OEM</a>, which is Complex Systems. They have listed OpenWRT as a supported operating system, so they probably have a customized build environment that results in a WPQ864-compatible OpenWRT image.</p><p>You might also want to ask more help from the LEDE forums, if you want to create a new LEDE device profile for your board.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Antek</strong> on 11 Jul 2017, 09:20)</p>

					<div class="quotebox"><cite>liveonlinux wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>The two files is different only about filesystem format, is it?</p></blockquote></div><p>Usually, yes. This depends on the instructions in the makefile. Usually the makefiles use specific naming conventions for the target files so it is easy for anyone to logically deduce what the files contain. However, if the makefiles are broken, then there&#039;s no knowing what these images really contain. Look at the makefiles and see what they do.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>liveonlinux wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>And each one can run OK?</p></blockquote></div><p>Impossible to say. Perhaps they work fine, perhaps they don&#039;t. Since you built these two images yourself on your own build environment, there&#039;s no way of knowing whether they will run or not. It depends on what settings you used, and whether these settings are correct for the target system where you intend to run the image.</p>									</div>
