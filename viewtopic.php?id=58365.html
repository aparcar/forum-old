					<p>I just performed an sysupgrade to a HooToo TM02 to CC 15.05 RC2. I had planned not to keep the settings, but failed to uncheck the box.&nbsp; The upgrade appeared to work.&nbsp; The device is at it&#039;s old settings.&nbsp; I was not able to access it via LuCi so I reinstalled it and rebooted the device.&nbsp; I can access it via Putty and WinSCP.&nbsp; I am still unable to access LuCi, but now noticed the message (in Chrome) ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED.&nbsp; I do see LuCi for a brief second before this message appears.</p><p>I thought I might be able to rescue this before resetting it.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>RangerZ</p>									</div>
