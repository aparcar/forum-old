					<p>I sometimes make things more difficult then they need to be...</p><p>I used the updated wifi firmware; the firmware originally in your build seems to be working better.

					<p>@Box8x<br />One thought. Does the adapter have a separate power supply or does it get its power from the USB/esata port?

					<p>Aaah Okay. Well im glad to have a reliable setup once again as the last firmware would just freeze up the router on pppoe hangups and i&#039;d have to physically go and reboot it. Thats not easy as its on a different floor. And then since i travel alot, any issues will mean the wife wont be able to troubleshoot it.<br />So far this 4.4.15 build is going great, great wifi perfomance, pppoe reliability and all the LEDs work!!</p><p>thanks alot for your work on this, much appreciated!</p><p>cheers!</p><br /><br /><div class="quotebox"><cite>davidc502 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div class="quotebox"><cite>jawad_hai wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Thanks david, i just tired your latest LEDE build and its working great. i simulated PPPoe disconnections and each time it reconnected with no problems at all.<br />I have a question, what is the purpose of Wan6? i saw a few posts around saying we shouldnt delete it..</p><br /><div class="quotebox"><cite>davidc502 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I do know that point to point over ethernet is included, but have not heard of any issues, and that&#039;s not to say you will not have any <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Cheers,</p></blockquote></div></blockquote></div><p>From what I understand IPV6 management.
