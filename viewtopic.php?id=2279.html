					<p>It would be really great if there was a Madwifi package for White Russian RC2. Even better, would be the madwifi.stripped version, for use with the Click router. See <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~jbicket/madwifi.stripped">http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~jbicket/madwifi.stripped</a> . I&#039;ve managed to get Click compiled, and will share my work with anyone who wants it, so if someone could complete the job by porting madwifi I&#039;d be in business here.</p><p>The Berlin RoofNet people had managed to get it compiled before, but I can&#039;t get it compiled by following their instructions. Even with some corrections of mistakes on those instructions, I am still stuck.</p><p>I&#039;ve seen various posts on here about madwifi, but they confuse me, as they seem to be rolled into hostap which I don&#039;t think is going to work. Also, lots of the posts are old, so anything more than two months old is going to be just as broken as the Berlin RoofNet stuff.</p><p>So, anyone who wants to help, reply here or in private. I am really anxious to get this going.</p>									</div>

					<p>I ported madwifi to openwrt today. The stuff is already in CVS and works well on my WL-500g, if I set lan_ifnames to &quot;eth0 ath0&quot; and install the driver. You can get a test image and the packages here: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/people/nbd/whiterussian/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/people/nbd/whiterussian/</a></p>									</div>
