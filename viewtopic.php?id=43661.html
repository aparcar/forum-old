					<p>I consider myself as a beginner in networking even-thought I am able to set up VPN using ZyWall, Fritz Box, OS X.<br />I have written this guide because I thought, I would ask the help of OpenWRT community. After many hours to understand how to set up :<br />— Multiple VLANs =&gt; LAN ;<br />— Multiple DHCP ;<br />— Reject or allow connections from some LANs to others ;<br />I am not sure every settings I have made are useful. Neither am I about the security perspective (don’t think my WiFi isn’t secure). If you’d like to point out stuff I should consider to help myself and others you’re welcome to do so using this post or me.com email : lange.ludo+openwrt</p><p>You may find the guide (sorry for the dirty screenshots they are readable) at : <a href="http://idisk.jumparound.be/public/OpenWrt.pdf">http://idisk.jumparound.be/public/OpenWrt.pdf</a><br />And the configuration at : <a href="http://idisk.jumparound.be/public/OpenWrt.tar.gz">http://idisk.jumparound.be/public/OpenWrt.tar.gz</a> (root/root)</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Lange.ludo</p><p>This is really good documentation.&nbsp; I&#039;d make a few suggestions on your content though:</p><p>1. It&#039;d probably be good to document your network&#039;s design needs from the start (eg. certain networks should not be reachable from others, only certain hosts should receive DHCP assignments etc). Doesn&#039;t have to be long, but would help in someone trying to follow the setup.</p><p>2. Deal with Layer 2 stuff first (ie. VLANs and Switchports) - would allow someone to easily adapt your guide later to use their own VLAN ids. Right now, the switch configuration is built up progressively which makes sense for a growing network, but could confuse someone who assumes that this section will vary per network / VLAN. On the other hand, you&#039;d have to get the user to make this decision up front, so this might require some extra explanation.&nbsp; However, port numbers on the switch would help a lot here, as this is never clear from the web interface</p><p>3. Maybe consider improving the resolution of the screenshots, as they are a little hard to read.</p><p>4. It&#039;s hard to include everything in a single diagram - maybe L2/L3 and L4+/firewalling diagrams could help? I would however make the division between your wired and wireless clients a bit clearer though (ie. split by networks, not by physical location) and show where individual VLANs are by coloured areas.</p><p>Did you have any plans to add a separate manageable switch later?&nbsp; This would be a good follow up as it would expand on how the openwrt handles vlan tagging across trunks.</p>									</div>
