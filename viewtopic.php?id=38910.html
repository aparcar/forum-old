					<p>A friend of mine recently introduced me to the world&nbsp; of OpenWRT/DD WRT and the possibility to set up a low power download and file server with these. But I need further help.<br />I have decided to purchase a Netgear WNDR 3800 and a Seagate GoFlex Home 1TB Gigabit NAS to set up a download and file server. I am new to Linux AND networking and need to confirm that it is possible to achieve what I want with above mentioned hardware. Is OpenWRT capable of running a fully working Torrent client that supports DHT, peer exchange and magnet link? WillI get good ftp and http downloader in it? Can I install a good enough web browser in it that will support major file sharing sites?<br />Also, I want to download directly to NAS. Is it possible?&nbsp; I also want&nbsp; WiFi, and printer and scanner sharing. Does the latest build of OpenWRT for that router support printer and scanner sharing and is wifi working?<br />I need all these functions to be practically usable without maintenance for the investment to be worthwhile. For extra software installation, I can insert a usb thumb drive in the hub or use the NAS instead if supported.<br />Please respond whether this whole setup is possible&nbsp; or not. I&#039;ll need&nbsp; your approval before I actually buy the hardware.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok I have understood the response to my post. This is why I hate linux. It is a DIY os. I have to spend the money, figure everything out myself. One thing I know already, no GUI browser here. so only direct links will work. Downloading to NAS is theoretically possible, but practically not sure.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sbcontt</strong> on 28 Aug 2012, 17:56)</p>
