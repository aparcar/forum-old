					<p>You don&#039;t need to configure an ULA prefix, but I would nevertheless recommend setting one. It&#039;s basically simple, if your (IPv6) uplink (wan6) ever goes down, your globaly IPv6 addresses go down as well, thereby crippling LAN internal connections as well (this is exaggerated, but to get the concept, you won&#039;t even be able to connect to your own router (via IPv6) without the working wan6 uplink or an ULA prefix (or link local addresses, or IPv4)).</p>									</div>

					<p>Ula is not required at all. Even if uplink dies we always have link-local addresses. They are always present.<br />Most home networks have only one segment and all devices can be addressed by link local</p>									</div>
