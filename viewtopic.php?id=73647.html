					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;m using a openwrt/lede 17.01.4 stable release on a mt7620 based router.<br />I would like to know if there is a miniPCI Express LTE module that runs on this stable.<br />I manage to run the Quectel EC25 module on a snapshot kernel 4.9 release, but I need a 4G/LTE module that works on the stable one.<br />Can you suggest me one?</p><p>Thank you!</p>									</div>

					<p>Im wondering, as the EC25 should be capable of LTE . I tried it, but only succeeded using serial driver.<br />So I switched back to Huawei ME909u-521 (both US and EU version). Running on MT7620A-router, in serial mode, too, up to about 20MBit/s . Which is good enough for our purpose.</p>									</div>

					<p>So you are not running Huawei ME909u-521 on LTE? Do you see it on /dev/cdc-wdm0?</p><p>In case you need, we are running Huawei 709S-2 on the stable release with no problem in HSPA+ mode at almost 20MBit/s, just following instruction here for 3gdongle on openwrt wiki. Also I was able to run the EC25 at almost 60MBit/s using a kernel 4.9 based firmware (following ltedongle openwrt wiki), but on that kernel there are modules like mwan that is diffucult to install.</p>									</div>

As (unfortunately) we still need to use quite old SDK from manufacturer, because board not officially supported (yet). Which results in about 20MBit/s, which _theoretically_ _might_ be exceeded, as mobile operator promises up to about 40MBit/s to be achievable with better driver. <br />But we are happy with the 20MBit/s.<br />Because of supposed to have better driver support, I tried the EC25 as an alternative, but got only serial driver running with same results, too, so we did not switch. Could not succeed to get a backported wdm-driver to run on our old stuff.</p>									</div>
