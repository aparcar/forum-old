However, since this is a bridged setup on the server-end, the server just &quot;plugs&quot; its own virtual interface into whatever network you tell it to (in this case, the &#039;lan&#039; network) and then forgets about it.</p><p>After the server and the client have negotiated the link, the client is now sitting there with an interface that is ready to go, but does not have any settings. What you need to do is tell it how to proceed. Most likely what you want to do is use a DHCP client to receive an IP address from the DHCP server that is sitting at the bridge junction (the &#039;lan&#039; network) on the server end, and configure the interface using the received settings.</p><p>I haven&#039;t used Ubuntu&#039;s desktop versions much, so if you have a desktop environment installed and you want to configure the interface automatically upon boot, then you&#039;ll need to check it&#039;s manual in order to configure the network interface.</p><p>If you want to try the command-line way, then I think Ubuntu supports a similar command-set as my Debian installation, so first check &#039;ifconfig -a&#039; on your client computer and see if the interface is created successfully. You should see the interface that your OpenVPN client created. It is most likely called &#039;tap0&#039;. Ensure that the interface is &#039;down&#039; i.e. &#039;ifconfig -a&#039; does not show either &quot;UP&quot; or &quot;RUNNING&quot; states for the interface.</p><p>You can now call &#039;dhclient tap0&#039; (or whatever the interface name is) in order to configure a DHCP client to control this interface. Then call &#039;ifconfig tap0 up&#039; to make it operational. After this, issuing &#039;ifconfig&#039; should now show the interface as UP and RUNNING, and it should&#039;ve received an IP address from the 172.22.22.0/24 address range (or whatever range you&#039;ve configured for the DHCP server on your router).</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you very much Antek. It wasn&#039;t clear to me I still had to bring the tap0 interface up on the VPN client side. When I do this manually like you say it works like a charm.<br />I find it a bit strange this is needed manually, because on most Ubuntu sites and explanations about TAP en OpenVPN say that bringing up the VPN is enough. So I will dive more into this (self or with Ubuntu community).<br />But thanks for pointing this out.</p><p>For now I added a simple BASH script (without a lot of failure checks) to fire up my VPN, if people are interested:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/bash

USAGE=&quot;Usage: homevpn start/stop/status&quot;

case ${1} in
  &quot;start&quot;)
    echo &quot;Firing up VPN. please wait&quot;
    sudo systemctl start openvpn@home-vpn

    echo &quot;VPN connected, waiting for tap0 interface&quot;
    until ifconfig tap0 &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
    do
        sleep 1
    done

    echo &quot;tap0 interface found, getting DHCP address&quot;
    sudo ifconfig tap0 down &amp;&amp; sudo dhclient tap0 &amp;&amp; sudo ifconfig tap0 up

    echo &quot;Got IP address, ready to go!&quot;
  ;;
  &quot;stop&quot;)
    sudo systemctl stop openvpn@home-vpn
  ;;
  &quot;status&quot;)
    sudo systemctl status openvpn@home-vpn
  ;;
  *)
    echo &quot;${USAGE}&quot;
    exit 1
