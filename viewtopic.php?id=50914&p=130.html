					<p>I just flashed r48479 on my WNDR3700v1 I have laying around because I am able to serial into it, but it booted fine (it looks like it has the 4.1.15 kernel though).

					<p>Using the latest (r48616) build on my WRT1900ACv1, and it&#039;s doing great. I do have a question, though. I see references to the &quot;sensors&quot; command relative to openWRT for the WRT1900AC, but I don&#039;t see it in this build. I assume that it&#039;s in a package that&#039;s not included in this build, then. If the package is compatible with this build, does anyone know what package that would be? Is it available through opkg? Or is there an equivalent command for getting CPU and radio temperatures that I&#039;m not aware of in this build?</p><p>Couple of other things that I&#039;m hoping are in the pipeline...the internet connection light isn&#039;t working in this build, but it does work on the latest trunk snapshot, so it seems that&#039;s coming. The other one is that ping times for my iPad Air are much lower on the most recent BrainSlayer dd-wrt releases, they went from about 38ms to 18ms on the Ookla internet speed test. So I&#039;m thinking that they have picked up a wireless driver change from Marvell that affected that Apple client. Something else to look forward to in a newer build (I hope).</p><p>Anyways, really appreciate all the work that goes into getting this put together and working so well. Thanks so much!</p><p>Update: I see that r48717 just appeared. Looks like neither the internet connection light or ping time improvement is in r48717, but it is working well so far.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>RogerSC</strong> on 13 Feb 2016, 22:17)</p>
