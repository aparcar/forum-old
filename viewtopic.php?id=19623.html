					<p>Roundsparrow suggested I open a new thread based on the DIR-615 REVISION A1 since the B1, C1, and D1<br />are so different. The CPU is a Mvl8361 500MZH 32MB RAM, 8MB FLASH. There are other devices that run<br />OPENWRT that have this same CPU so I assume getting WRT onto this router should be doable.</p><p>Anyone who would like to leave any information on the DIR-615 REVISION A, this is the place!</p><p>Thanks!!!</p><p>- MENTALDOMINANCE -</p>									</div>

					<p>Ebay sellers are flogging these things without mentioning they are A1 and obsolete with 2007 firmware....&nbsp; &nbsp;I was hoping someone had rescued the people (myself included) who bought one but judging by the age of this thread, it doesn&#039;t seem likely.</p><p>If the CPU is known, what would I have to do to knock this up myself?&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing I&#039;d have to get Jtag working (I have a linksys one here from my wrt-350n) but other than recover and load firmware, I&#039;ve never done embedded hacking.&nbsp; &nbsp; Know my way around Linux though.</p><p>any suggestions?</p><p>cheers and sorry for resurrection of this thread..</p><br /><p>Update: </p><p>Just noticed that the source code for the 615 A1 is available here:<br /><a href="ftp://tsd.dlink.com.tw/GPL/index.html">ftp://tsd.dlink.com.tw/GPL/index.html</a></p><p>If it&#039;s GPL I&#039;m presuming it&#039;s a Linux based firmware?&nbsp; Would hang this source code help porting dd-wrt with driver modules and such? downloading it now to have a look but I&#039;m not overly confident.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>frankieh</strong> on 25 Sep 2010, 19:11)</p>
