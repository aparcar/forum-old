					<p>Yesterday my USB memory stick went dead.<br />It was not detected any more.</p><p>Because this was not the first time I encountered this with a USB memory stick, and I like to recover my data this is what I did.<br />I put the stick in the freezer for 10 minutes, yes the freezer.<br />After 10 minutes I tried the stick, and it&#039;s was working, but stoped after 5-15 minutes.<br />I did this a couple of times to backup my data.:)</p><p>So I got my data back, but the stick was not usable any more.<br />Because there was nothing to loose, I revived my stick in the kitchen.</p><p>This is the &quot;recipe&quot;.:lol:</p><p>Heat the oven at 200 degrees C.<br />Remove the plastic cover from the memory stick.<br />Let it &quot;bake&quot; for 10 minutes.<br />After the 10 minutes, let the memory stick slowly cool down at room temperature.</p><p>If you are lucky, it is detected now.<br />Reformat the memory stick.</p><p>After this the stick was working again.</p><p>This is no guarantee that it will work for you.<br />Don&#039;t use this stick for important data, it could fail any time.!</p>									</div>

					<p>Great trick! </p><p>But let me improve on it. I think it is crucial (!?;) to make sure the inner parts (especially the ICs) of the stick is laying on a flat &amp; level surface while baking in the oven, or you risk that it moves away from its solder pads. Short-circuit!</p>									</div>
