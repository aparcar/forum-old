					<p>Greetings,</p><p>I have openwrt 14.07&nbsp; (Trunk 0.12+svn-r10530 to be exact) installed on a TP-Link TL-WDR4300 v1.</p><p>I&#039;ve setup both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz wireless networks and I see something a bit strange.<br />for the 2.4Ghz network, the luci ui shows that the max speed is 65 Mbit/s, the netbook I&#039;m using in the living room (running windows) shows the same number, but if I use the netgear router my isp provided me I see on the windows machine 150 Mbit/s.<br />so I wonder, how reliable are the numbers that I see in the luci ui?<br />also the 5Ghz network shows only 72.2 Mbit/s when the RPi2 machine is 3 meters away behind the wall. is it possible that the wall causes that much of an impact on the link quality?<br />just to test the actual, data transfer, I&#039;ve used this <a href="https://jbowes.wordpress.com/2010/10/13/measuring-network-speeds-with-netcat-and-dd/">howto</a> to test the speed and I get this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dagg@NCC-5001-D ~ $ dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024K count=512 | nc -v streamer 2222

536870912 bytes (537 MB) copied, 115.645 s, 4.6 MB/s</code></pre></div><p>which translates to 36.8 Mbit/s.</p><p>so, what is the right speed I have and why is it that slow?</p><p>Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>daggs</strong> on 22 Sep 2015, 22:16)</p>

					<p>The Netgear may be using HT40, as its likely the Netbook does not support MIMO so will only be able to do around 65Mbit at HT20 and 150Mbit at HT40.</p><p>Its generally recommended to stick with HT20 on 2.4Ghz though as unless there are NO other 2.4Ghz networks around, it will just be subject to more interference which can actually make it <strong>slower</strong> in real-world use.</p><p>You almost certainly should be using HT40 on 5Ghz though. (the setting is HT40+ or HT40-, depending on if you want to share with a higher or lower channel, I just used HT40+)</p><p>Also depending on your country, using a higher channel (I use 100) on 5Ghz may drastically improve its performance through walls by allowing you to set a much higher transmit power.&nbsp; That probably requires upgrading to OpenWRT 15.05 though.</p><p>My setting on the WDR3600 for 5Ghz is:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>config wifi-device &#039;radio2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option type &#039;mac80211&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option channel &#039;100&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option hwmode &#039;11na&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option path &#039;pci0000:00/0000:00:00.0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; list ht_capab &#039;LDPC&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; list ht_capab &#039;SHORT-GI-20&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; list ht_capab &#039;SHORT-GI-40&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; list ht_capab &#039;TX-STBC&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; list ht_capab &#039;RX-STBC1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; list ht_capab &#039;DSSS_CCK-40&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option txpower &#039;28&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option htmode &#039;HT40+&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option country &#039;GB&#039;</p></blockquote></div>									</div>
