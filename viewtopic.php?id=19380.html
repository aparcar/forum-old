					<p>Hi to all,</p><p>I tried to get saned working for hours now. I found several topics here dealing with sane but none helped me.</p><p>I&#039;m running Kamikaze 8.09 with Xwrt on my WGT634U. I installed the following packages: kmod-usb2 libusb kmod-usb-uhci sane-backends&nbsp; sane-libs libusb libpthread xinetd.</p><p>The first problem I came across was that my kamikaze doesn&#039;t seem to know the command lsusb so I cannot check if the usb-scanner (HP-PSC-1600) is responding. When i plug it in, the devive seems to notice this but it says:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>hub 1-0:1.0: unable to enumerate USB device on port 1</code></pre></div><p>the second problem is that there is no sane-find-scanner or scanimage. do i have to install another package?</p><p>the third problem is, that there is no /etc/services file.</p><p>is there someone out there runing saned on his/her kamikaze-device? can someone help me?</p>									</div>
