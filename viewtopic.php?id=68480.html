I&#039;m a bit lost between networkid and VLANs.</p></blockquote></div><p>It wasn&#039;t possible to determine that looking at the script you posted, but it is somewhat curious. The dnsmasq / ipset usage model typically marks packets that match a set of named FQDNs and then routes these marked packets via a specific routing table that (usually) points to a vpn tunnel. This is how I&#039;m using it, as I have the misfortune to live in a place where a substantial number of websites are blocked. Anyway, glad you were able to adapt the rule for your purposes. </p><p>Regarding DHCP, it&#039;s a little tricky to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution. You&#039;ve not really given enough information or outlined if there are any constraints you have that make one or another of the simpler solutions impossible. </p><p>The suggestion I made with respect to the network id doesn&#039;t require marking packets at all. Theoretically, if you put in an &quot;option networkid &lt;openwrt logical interface name&gt;&quot;, that should make the dhcp section apply only to the packets that come in over the named interface. You&#039;ll need to play with it to verify the functionality, as I have not used it before. If it works correctly, it should be easy and transparent - you&#039;ll give the clients connected to one interface a specific range and on the other interface a different range. Otherwise everything else should work the same.</p><p>A simpler and foolproof solution if you have a small network is just use static DHCP where you assign static leases to clients based on their MAC address. This way you control which clients get which IP in a very granular way.</p><p>[Explanation simplified for your case where your DHCP server is running on your router which also happens to be your switch]. The problem with DHCP is that it is a broadcast protocol. A client wanting an IP broadcasts a packet that the DHCP server picks up and then replies to. So you can have two DHCP servers on the same LAN segment (since by default your wireless LAN and wired LAN on OpenWrt are bridged together, they&#039;re one LAN segment or VLAN, or if you like, broadcast domain), but they need to serve different IP ranges (which you want) and, more importantly, selectively reply to the client based on some identifying information (hence the suggestion about the config classifier option with a networkid). If you cannot classify the clients in some way so that the right DHCP range is served, then you need to isolate the DHCP servers and clients into separate broadcast domains so that the DHCP server only sees broadcast requests from the relevant set of clients. Isolating computers into separate broadcast domains is done with VLANs. </p><p>The solution with VLANs essentially breaks your single network into isolated segments that, to the clients and the router, are viewed as two physically distinct networks. This means that clients and router on one VLAN will not see broadcast packets from clients and router on the other VLAN. So now you can happily put a DHCP server on each VLAN and hand out different addresses. If you want them all in the 192.168.1.x range then you need to subnet that range by using an appropriate subnet mask.</p><p>Subnetting will break the single class C network into two (or more, depending on the mask) separate networks. For two networks, you would use the following</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Subnet           Mask    Decimal Mask       IP Range              Broadcast
192.168.1.0      /25     255.255.255.128    192.168.1.1 - 126     192.168.1.127
192.168.1.128    /25     255.255.255.128    192.168.1.129 - 254   192.168.1.255</code></pre></div><p>To be honest, with a private ip range I don&#039;t see the need to subnet unless you have a very specific reason for wanting all clients in the 192.168.1.x range. I would just use two different networks, for example 192.168.1.0/24 and 192.168.2.0/24.</p><p>The disadvantage with using VLANs is added management overhead, since they&#039;re two distinct networks. Also, all communication between clients on the one VLAN and clients on the other VLAN will be routed via your router. They won&#039;t be able to communicate directly. This may pose a problem, for example, if you&#039;re using DLNA or other multicast protocols and you want a media server on one VLAN to serve clients on the other VLAN, as you&#039;d need to specifically forward packets between VLANs. You&#039;d also need to make Windows clients aware of the subnets in order to do file sharing across subnets. You&#039;re also doubling up on firewall rules to some extent.</p><p>I think you need to consider exactly what you&#039;re trying to achieve, read up on VLANs and their relative advantages and disadvantages, read up on the DHCP protocol and then select the least complex solution that achieves your goals. It may turn out that static DHCP is the simplest solution if you have a small number of hosts.</p>									</div>
