					<p>Im working with the 10.3.01 sdk and my flashes work fine.&#039;</p><p>How ever on ubiquity devices you can either use the reset button or use a built in command called fwupdate. Fwupdate is pissy about the header in the image .</p><p>What im trying to do is change&nbsp; header from <br />OPENUBNTXM.ar7240.OpenWrt.r29661<br />to <br />OPENXM.ar7240.OpenWrt.r29661</p><p>I found where the MAGIC part of the header is declared but i can;t find a way to &quot;spoof&quot; the version part of the header in the image file. Any help would be appreciated.</p><p>Note i cant just change the file beause there is some md5 like check called the crc that failes if I mess with the headers.</p>									</div>

					<p>I found the solution to this ,</p><p>In /home/ethan/openWrtBuild/Backfire10.3.1/backfire/target/linux/ar71xx/image there is the make file for the images</p><p>grep for ubnt0-nano-m, in that line change ar7240 to ar7240.v5.3.5. </p><p>That line will trick the fwupdate program on AirOS into flashing its self with your open wrt flash file</p>									</div>
