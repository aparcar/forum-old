					<p>I am new to the OpenWrt community. I recently purchased a Linksys WRT1200AC router (version V2) and loaded this firmware image:&nbsp; openwrt-15.05.1-mvebu-armada-385-linksys-caiman-squashfs-factory.img</p><p>Everything appeared to load and operate well; I configured the router according to the instructions on the OpenWrt.org website. Although everything looks good, I cannot connect to the Internet. </p><p>What am I overlooking? </p><p>mmabon2005, 2017-06-21</p>									</div>

					<p>Hard to say without knowing anything about your network or how you configured the device... Anyway, I would consider installing LEDE on that device; it is quite recent, and OpenWrt has not been updated for a while.</p>									</div>
