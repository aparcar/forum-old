					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;ve tried to install DebWRT over my CC OpenWRT with MTD way (following instructions for my device on DebWRT website).</p><p>Unfortunately after firmware flash router keep restarting it looks like normal boot then all LEDs blink and procedure start again. Can&#039;t login to router and do nothing. Tried to failsafe mode with a reset button but nothing worked. Can I somehow install openwrt back on my device? Or now it&#039;s just a brick and I need a new one?</p>									</div>

					<p>If you&#039;re lucky, tftp is enabled in your device&#039;s oem bootloader (it wasn&#039;t in the original batches, but retrofitted in later oem firmware updates) - if not, theonly option would be to recover from a serial console.The wiki should have hints for both options.</p>									</div>
