					<p>Well they aren&#039;t officially unsupported (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start</a>).<br />But it seems nobody has tried them.<br />OTOH Thomson produce a lot of crud.<br />It is a fairly involved task to port openWRT to new hardware, particularly if the stock firmware on the device isn&#039;t open source (as in the Thomson case - I think). <br />Take a look at the link above and see if there are supported Thomsons with similar chips to those yours contain (yup, screwdriver required!).<br />Good luck.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the quick reply!<br />I do not care too much how to solve my challenge, as long as I get it done.<br />I am also looking at a possible Java Proxy solution, but no clue how to auto insert the proxy so any device connecting to the Thomson wifi will go through the proxy and it&#039;s facebook like &#039;barrier&#039;....</p><p>As said earlier I am pretty novice still. I am a quick learner and open to any possible solution path. As long as I can reuse my Thomson routers. A separate proxy server or any other type of server is possible too, as long as there is a way to get the thomson to always go through that one server, so I can enforce the facebook challenge before opening the wifi for that device to open internet</p>									</div>

					<p>Give it 24 hours. Maybe someone has hands on experience with this hardware.<br />Otherwise it is down to you! Obviously people will try and help, but you have the hardware.<br />On openwrt.org, check the docs and wiki for flashing, and for recovering bricked routers. Also the links I gave above.<br />It might well be that Attitude Adjustment (current stable) or Snapshot/trunk (work in progress) will mostly work. But as in most things openWRT, there are no guarantees!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, if someone interested I could help to bring Openwrt support for this router (without xDSL). I can provide a working bootloader for the router with its own board ID.</p><p>Of course a JTAG programmer is mandatory for flashing/testing the new bootloader. Once the new bootloader is confirmed to work, making a working Openwrt firmware should be easy.</p><p>Regards.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ll try the CFE too. I have those TG789xx routers as well, also supplied in The Netherlands by the ISP KPN. I might just directly flash it into the chips. Those thomson routers have no pre-loader, right?</p><p>How did you make the CFE by the way? I&#039;m in need of customised CFE&#039;s for my own hacking on a few ZTE DSL routers with very similar hardware, but I haven&#039;t really looked into it that much since the ZTE routers use a pre-loader that loads before the CFE.

					<p>Hi <strong>rqn</strong>. I built the CFE using the sourcecode I found from a Netgear router, with a few modifications (nothing really important). This particular router has a SoC with no preloader. The CPU just executes the binary code found in the flash chip at offset 0x0.</p><p>The BCM63168 probably is a bit different. No idea if it has a preloader. Looks like your router has two bootloaders ROM and RAM. This is usually found in bcm963xx boards with NAND flashes, but not Parallel or SPI NOR flash chips like yours.</p>									</div>

It has the same preloader as two other models (same ISP firmware, also made by ZTE). One model above this one and one model below this one.
