					<p>I have no idea how to do this, but essentially i got this crazy idea of using a switch, and thought, would it be possible to have a dedicated machine (could also run a server as well, like subsonic or whatever else) be the brains for the switch? If it is possible, and someone has done this already, could you also tell me how to do it as well. I don&#039;t have to much experience with linux, nor do i have any idea how to program, but i was able to set up openwrt and am comfortable with working inside a terminal. I understand a good bit of the options in the gui, although some of the firewall stuff goes way over my head.</p><p>I would also be interested in connecting some wifi antennas to the machine. I would likely use 2 separate antennas, 2.4ghz and 5ghz and would want them on the same network as the wired.</p><p>I apologize for being so stupid, if this is a stupid question.</p>									</div>
