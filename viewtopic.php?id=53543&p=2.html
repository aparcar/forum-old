					<p>I read that WDR4300 has 3 antennas for the 5Ghz. I noticed that my WDR3600 works better with 2.4Ghz, maybe because I don&#039;t have many electromagnetic interferences. How 5Ghz performs in 4300?</p>									</div>

					<p>5Ghz always performs worse than 2.4Ghz in relation to distance and especially obstacles, that is just inherently the case with higher Hz bands, unavoidable.</p>									</div>

Several config files were changed in the move from AA to BB, so sometimes a straight sysupgrade didn&#039;t work quite right. I&#039;m sure if you reset to defaults and reconfigured, everything would be fine. </p><p>The C7 v2 is good too and is really better when running trunk, especially since there was no Luci support for 802.11ac configuration in BB.</p>									</div>
