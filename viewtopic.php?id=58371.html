					<p>Hi<br />I&#039;m planning to build a custom no-frills image to update my WNDR3700v1 currently on a AA image I built about 3 years ago.</p><p>Should I go for BB or skip altogether it an jump to CC15.05-rc2?</p><p>The aim is to build a pretty minimalistic image, only purely router, wifi AP and switch stuff. No USB, VPN, Samba or torrent nonsense as I got a NAS to handle some of that, is CC quite stable in this scenario?</p>									</div>

					<p>Both are stable in 3700. You should skip BB14.07 as the code starts to be rather old.

					<p>I may as well go for your curated build since it fits most of my requirements and save myself the make config and compilation hassle.

					<p>Disabling ipv6 completely might be rather complicated, and the tunnel components are just a few kB each. USB support is also rather small.</p><p>I have not applied jow&#039;s reghack patches, so the channel availability may be limited. I see channels 12 and 13 available, but 14 is disabled as I have HT40 mode.</p><p>In general, wndr3700 has enough flash, so you do not have to scrape every available kB away from flash.</p><p>And there is enough RAM for any normal router operation.</p>									</div>

					<p>Like you said, ipv6 doesn&#039;t take up much space anyways.

					<p>Oh well... I just managed to dig up the Lubuntu 12.10 VM I had used to compile my image 3 years ago, fired it up, cloned CC 15.05, overwrote the regdb.txt with my own, took hnyman&#039;s config init recipe, disabled all USB and IPv6 stuff and 2 hours later voil√°, got my spanking new build (you gotta love open source!). <br />I&#039;ll try it tonight. If doesn&#039;t work I&#039;ll just go with hnyman&#039;s image and disable IPv6 with arokh&#039;s trick.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
