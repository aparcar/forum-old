					<p>Hello.<br />I have a spare netbook (ASUS EEE 2G surf) and was wondering if it could run openwrt or any of the open firmwares. It has a LAN port and an Atheros wifi adapter.</p><p>We have a router at home that&#039;s just a plain one from our ISP. What I want to do is that the netbook would be wired to it, then connect to my VPN service through OpenVPN, and create a secondary wi-fi only for personal use. I want to do this because I don&#039;t want to force everyone at home (or visitors) to use a proxy that would create problems for online banking, for example.</p><p>So the question is, can I install it on my netbook just like any linux distro? Does it have support for VPN clients like openvpn?<br />Thanks in advance. I tried searching but haven&#039;t found anything so far.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>netbookvpn</strong> on 6 Aug 2013, 02:38)</p>
