					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am trying to hack the D-Link DGS-1210 switch, as all source code is provided by D-Link and it seems &quot;doable&quot; to port OpenWRT.<br />See my post here : <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=56245">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=56245</a></p><p>On the board, there are 8 straight pins available. One of them is returning 3,3 V, so I guess this is the serial console.</p><p>How to find and connect the PINs to a serial cable?</p><p>The red lead should be connected to 3V,<br />The black lead to GND,<br />The white lead to TXD.<br />The green lead to RXD.</p><p>At first, I am trying to find ground PIN. How to proceed ?</p><p>Kind regards,<br />GNUTELLA</p>									</div>

					<p>Unfortunately, I think I fried the motherboard trying to connect pins together. I touched two pins and the board does not boot. I does not matter, still have two switches and there useless as D-Link offers no IPv6 and they can trashed anyway for lack of D-Link to offer real products.</p><p>I will enquire the dead board first.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gnutella</strong> on 14 Mar 2015, 14:51)</p>

					<p>The ground is connected to all the system grounds, such as the shield plates and the (-) side of the power adapter plug.&nbsp; This should be apparent when looking at the board and seeing that the pin is connected to a large area of copper instead of just a trace.&nbsp; You can test this with an ohmmeter, should be near zero ohms from the pin to something that is grounded.&nbsp; Never use an ohmmeter with the system power on, of course.</p>									</div>
