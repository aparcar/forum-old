					<p>Hi All, </p><p>I recently bought the Buffalo AirStation N450 and want to configure it as client/repeater for a wpa2 enterprise network (802.1x). Unfortunately i can&#039;t find the 802.1x setting under &quot;Security Mode&quot;. I am using the default dd-wrt build that came with the router. I was wondering if anyone here knows if changing to OpenWRT will enable me to link with a wpa2 enterprise network?</p><p>I thank you in advance!</p>									</div>

					<p>So it was my bad and this router is supported?<br />I&#039;m rather surprised because it is not listed in TOH.</p><p>The thing is... if something goes wrong, there is no documentation at all to help solve potential problems.<br />So my suggestion to TS is to wait and not flash the device yet.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, you can configure it as a client/repeater for a WPA2 Enterprise network using <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless/encryption">wpad</a>.</p><p>There are two versions of wpad. &quot;wpad-mini&quot; and &quot;wpad&quot;.<br />The &quot;wpad mini&quot; doesn&#039;t include support for WPA2 Enterprise.<br />The &quot;wpad&quot; is the full package and supports WPA2 Enterprise.</p><p>One of them is usually pre-installed.<br />If you have the mini version installed, just remove it and install the full &quot;wpad&quot;.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>angelos</strong> on 27 Jun 2015, 04:03)</p>
