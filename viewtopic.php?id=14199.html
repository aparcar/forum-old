					<p>I&#039;ve got an Asus wl500gp with Kamikaze 7.09 installed that freezes once every 4-10 hours and I am trying to figure out why. Here&#039;s a timeline of my meddling:</p><p>1. Flashed the firmware, installed Kamikaze 7.09 without any problems. I then proceeded to the installation of X-Wrt which went smoothly. After that I connected two computers to the router (one wired and one wireless).<br />2. Due to lack of time the router remained like that for one week without any modifications to the firmware. I had an uptime of 7 days, so there was no problem with the config.<br />3. A few days ago I installed an external usb 2.0 hard drive on the router using <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/UsbStorageHowto">this</a> HOWTO. No problems whatsoever, I added the automount to the router&#039;s startup and everything was going great.<br />4. I then installed SAMBA using ipkg and created my own cfg file.<br />5. I installed vsftpd using ipkg and did not edit the cfg file. </p><p>The SAMBA and vsftpd install were done pretty much one after another.</p><p>Now, the router freezes once every few hours and I can&#039;t figure out what the problem is. The network drops, the router does not respond to ping - the only solution is to pull the power cord to reset it. </p><p>I don&#039;t realize what&#039;s going on. I don&#039;t think it can overheat since there is plenty of free ram and processor left. Any ideas?</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not sure which one was causing the problem.
