					<p>Hmm... sound interesting, but I didn&#039;t find anything about &quot;simultaneous dualband&quot; so I&#039;m afraid this device has only one radio <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> <br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>With three dual-band antennas, TL-WR2543ND generates a maximum theoretical wireless throughput of 450Mbps over the 2.4GHz <strong>or</strong> 5GHz channels utilizing a 3 X 3 Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) configuration.</p></blockquote></div><p>update: the TL-WR2543ND has only one wifi, but I found this: <br />The TL-WR2843ND (bright red) is capable of running simultaneous 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks, while the TL-WR2543ND can run at 2.4GHz or 5GHz. Both use three MIMO streams to get this headline speed, which TP-Link says will also improve range by up to 20 per cent. <a href="http://www.expertreviews.co.uk/networking/1281982/tp-link-showcases-450mbit-s-wireless-router">http://www.expertreviews.co.uk/networki … ess-router</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 12 Oct 2011, 13:44)</p>

					<p>Has anyone tried to compare the WAN-&gt;LAN speed of a Tl-WR2543ND with a TL-WR1043ND? I am using the software TP Link supply. I haven&#039;t yet tried any alternatives, like OpenWRT. With a 1043 I get a steady 130MBbps HTTP download, if the far end isn&#039;t blocking. This speed has been very consistent. Now I have tried a 2543 as a direct substitute for a 1043, and the HTTP download speed has dropped to under 100MBps, and is more erratic. I know the box isn&#039;t sold on its WAN-&gt;LAN speed, but the 2543 is supposed to be the higher performance machine, and seems to have a faster CPU. My result seems counter intuitive.</p>									</div>

					<p>WAN-&gt;WLAN I seem to get about 80MBps with the 2543. WAN-&gt;LAN I get something like 100Mbps. A 1043 is a bit better than this.</p><p>I usually use a small Intel i3 based Linux box to route to this WAN port, where I can sustain 800Mbps to 900Mbps to some nearby servers (though obviously not to arbitrary remote locations). 1G home links are available.

					<p>It&#039;s an interesting box, to me. It sells for about EUR 60.- in Italy. The throughput is not importan to me as the 64 MB or RAM, twice as the 1043.<br />I can see <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/">here</a> there&#039;s &quot;some support&quot; for it.<br />Any advice about it?<br />Anyone already tested it with OpenWRT?</p>									</div>
