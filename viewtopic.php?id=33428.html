					<p>Hi,</p><p>Does anyone have a openwrt image for wr703n that includes both 3g dongle support (huawei) and VPNC (EasyVPN)?<br />I have tried a couple of times now to get in up and running but always fails based on no space on device.<br />(got vpnc to work connecting using lan, and 3g dongle to connect to 3g internet, just not at the same time)<br />And I have test with jffs2 and squashfs images, but either the image is missing 3g dongle drivers from start or there is not enough disk space to install vpnc.</p><p>So, before I start looking into creating my own image, is there anyone out there already maybe?</p><p>Cheers<br />-Anders</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>carlberg</strong> on 10 Dec 2011, 01:27)</p>

					<p>...and so I did..<br />Took a while before I got all drivers etc in the image, trial-and-error.... but now it works! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Still a bit confused about how to really know what drivers to use for usb devices... <br />ex. when dmesg just say: usb 1-1: new high speed USB device number 4 using ar71xx-ehci.<br />How do I best figure out what driver to add?<br />I used lsusb -v and tried to find any clues from that, then going back and adding drivers to the image, flash the wr703n again and hope that I got more info.<br />Is there any better way?</p><p>Cheers<br />-Anders</p>									</div>
