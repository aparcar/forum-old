					<p>I have recently switched from Gargoyle on a WRT160BL to OpenWRT (Trunk) on a TL-WDR4300</p><p>I often use Wake-on-lan or WOL to turn on my computers when I am away from home and this has always worked well with Gargoyle, however I can&#039;t get it working through LuCI on OpenWRT.</p><p>I have installed Luci-app-wol and wol so I have the option of using WOL rather than Etherwake (which also doesn&#039;t work for me). Using WOL via LuCI the following command is issued:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/usr/bin/wol -v &quot;08:60:6E:XX:XX:XX&quot;
&gt;&gt; Waking up 08:60:6E:XX:XX:XX with 255.255.255.255:40000...</code></pre></div><p>This does not work and my packet sniffer shows no UDP packet reaches my PC.</p><p>If I manually issue the command (via SSH):<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/usr/bin/wol -h 192.168.1.255 -v &quot;08:60:6E:XX:XX:XX&quot;
&gt;&gt; Waking up 08:60:6E:XX:XX:XX with 192.168.1.255:40000...</code></pre></div><p>THIS DOES WORK! - The router handles the request sent to the IP broadcast address (x.x.x.255). So I guess my question is, why is the default behaviour not working? Should I be configuring something within my firewall pages to allow the default functionality of either WOL or Etherwake to work?</p><p>If anyone can point me in the right direction I&#039;d really appreciate it!</p><p>Matt</p>									</div>

					<p>Just installed luci-app-wol and etherwake dependency on trunk r39005/Luci r9941 and it works as long as you specify the correct interface in the drop-down box. &quot;Broadcast on all&quot; does not work for me.&nbsp; I have all interfaces bridged as LAN (wwan provides LTE) and eth0 does not work either but eth0.1 and br-lan do.</p>									</div>

					<p>That is so strange. Using Etherwake does not work for me at all, even if I specify eth0.1 or br-lan.</p><p>My set-up is WAN as PPPoE, but I have also tried it as DHCP Client but nothing works.</p><p>Are you able to confirm that using /usr/bin/wol -v &quot;08:60:6E:XX:XX:XX&quot; (from witihin ssh) correctly broadcasts the Magic Packet? (The default luci-app-wol only installs etherwake, so you might need to opkg install wol)</p>									</div>

					<p>No idea why but it seems a bug and given that both etherwake and wol don&#039;t broadcast on all interfaces.&nbsp; I am guessing that the <br />failure of &quot;default&quot; settings in both are related.&nbsp; But it is puzzling that etherwake does not work in the configuration that works for me. You are specifying the correct interface?&nbsp; I know that might be a very irritating question.....</p>									</div>
