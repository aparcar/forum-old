					<p>Hi everyone, could you please suggest the best wireless router for the following condition.&nbsp; I need dual radios in one box (1 for client STA mode, and 1 for AP mode).&nbsp; I&nbsp; also would like detachable antennas and preferably atheros chips.&nbsp; I&#039;ve looked at buffalo and engenious devices but haven&#039;t found anything with dual radios, detachable antennas, and atheros.&nbsp; </p><p>Thanks for reading.</p>									</div>

					<p>So far, I have found&nbsp; the D-Link DIR-825 to have my required features:<br />Dual radios<br />Detachable antennas<br />Atheros chips</p><p>I am worried about the 4MB of flash because I hope to install some third party packages.&nbsp; Hopefully the USB port will be useful for that limitation.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve been very happy with the DIR-825 rev B1 and B2.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got about four of them in total, and have used them in both station and AP modes, including simultaneous station on one radio and AP on the other.&nbsp; However, as far as I can tell, radio 0 can only do 2.4 GHz, and radio 1 can only do 5 GHz.&nbsp; Apparently in some (but perhaps not all?) units, radio 1 is configurable for either 2.4 or 5 GHz.</p><p>I have installed some optional OpenWRT packages on mine, and an getting close to the 4 MB flash limit.&nbsp; I plan to move to a USB flash, but haven&#039;t done it yet.</p><p>I&#039;m really hoping to see OpenWRT support for the Asus RT-ACC66U router, as it would be a great upgrade from the DIR-825.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>brouhaha</strong> on 26 Jan 2013, 01:32)</p>

					<p>I should also mention that it took me *forever* to figure out why I wasn&#039;t able to use recent releases of OpenWRT on the DIR-825 in station mode.&nbsp; You have to replace the hostapd package with wpad-mini.&nbsp; If this is documented somewhere, I haven&#039;t found it.</p>									</div>
