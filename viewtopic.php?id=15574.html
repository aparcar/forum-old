					<p>Hi @all,</p><p>first of all, one word to the dewvelopers of OpenWRT :</p><p>I&#039;m using your masterpiece of openwrt firmware for a very long time now.</p><p>Absolute amazing work you&#039;ve done so far.</p><br /><p>Now back to my problem.</p><p>I would like to add comments to my custom iptables rules with the &quot;-m comment --comment&quot; statement. But for this to work I would need the ipt_comment.o .</p><p>I&#039;m using Kamikaze 7.09 (2.4 branch) on a WRT54GS V1.0 at the moment.</p><p>Maybe someone had the same issue and already compiled this module. Would save me a lot of time if someone could post it here or send it to me.</p><p>Searching on the forums and on google didn&#039;t turn up anything.</p><p>I hope I haven&#039;t missed anything important.</p><br /><p>Best regards</p><p>McBlack</p>									</div>
