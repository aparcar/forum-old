					<p>Hello,</p><p>Wondering if someone can help me currently have a Linksys WRT54GL Router with openWRT and I want to put DD-WRT onto it. I have tried the following but get &#039;read only file system&#039;&nbsp; I cant seem to get around this. Using Telnet, got the router it failsafe mode. Any ideas im really lost and out of google power <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Jay</p><br /><br /><br /><p>----------------------</p><br /><br /><p>Upgrade from openwrt<br />From DD-WRT Wiki<br />Jump to: navigation, search</p><p>I had a linksys WRT54GS version 2 router that I wanted to upgrade from openwrt to dd-wrt. I could not find any documentation on how to do this. So I created this page just in case anyone else needed to do this.</p><br /><p>Replace your firware image referenced below with the correct image for you router.</p><br /><p>secure shell or telnet into the router running openwrt</p><p>cd /tmp</p><p>wget <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/dd-wrtv2/downloads/v24-sp1/Consumer/Linksys/WRT54GS_v2/dd-wrt.v24_mini_generic.bin">http://www.dd-wrt.com/dd-wrtv2/download â€¦ eneric.bin</a></p><p>mtd -r write dd-wrt.v24_mini_generic.bin linux</p><br /><p>If all goes well your router will reboot, and when it comes up it will be running dd-wrt</p><p>I did a factory defaults after the reboot, I am not sure if it is needed or not.</p>									</div>
