					<p>What is this router&#039;s status regarding OpenWRT? </p><p>Bought this router today specifically as a guinea pig for my OpenWRT fun (wanna port some stuff over), and it was listed here <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/ru/toh/start">http://wiki.openwrt.org/ru/toh/start</a> as &quot;Supported&quot;.<br />Then, on the page it was written off as &quot;Partially&quot; supported, indicating some issues with wireless. It&#039;s unpleasant, but I can live with that.</p><p>Tried to build an image for it, and now I have the following images in bin/:</p><p>openwrt-bcm53xx-asus-rt-ac56u-squashfs.trx<br />openwrt-bcm53xx-asus-rt-ac68u-squashfs.trx<br />openwrt-bcm53xx-asus-rt-ac87u-squashfs.trx<br />openwrt-bcm53xx-asus-rt-n18u-squashfs.trx<br />openwrt-bcm53xx-buffalo-wxr-1900dhp-squashfs.trx<br />openwrt-bcm53xx-buffalo-wzr-1750dhp-squashfs.trx<br />openwrt-bcm53xx-buffalo-wzr-600dhp2-squashfs.trx<br />openwrt-bcm53xx-buffalo-wzr-900dhp-squashfs.trx<br />openwrt-bcm53xx-netgear-r6250-squashfs.chk<br />openwrt-bcm53xx-netgear-r6300-v2-squashfs.chk<br />openwrt-bcm53xx-netgear-r8000-squashfs.chk<br />openwrt-bcm53xx-smartrg-sr400ac-squashfs.trx</p><p>None of them seem to correspond to my router. Which one should I flash?<br />Or, how do I build one specifically for my piece?</p>									</div>

What now?</p><p>The other one with similar caption (CONFIG_TARGET_brcm47xx, Broadcom BCM47xx/53xx (MIPS)) gives me unsurprisingly 47xx files. Not one of them is for my device, although there&#039;s one generic. But I believe I shouldn&#039;t flash a firmware for wrong architecture.</p>									</div>

For this reason, we work with a temporary single table:<br />&nbsp; <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9061436/openwrt/toh/latest/index.html">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/906 â€¦ index.html</a></p><p>The ToH indicates that target=brcm47xx.<br />The device page indicates it is a mips 74K cpu:<br />&nbsp; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/asus/rt-n10u">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/asus/rt-n10u</a></p><p>So this is probably where you should look for generic images, or find inspiration for building yourself:<br />&nbsp; <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/brcm47xx/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/brcm47xx/</a></p><p>I suppose you are aware that flashing the wrong image may brick your router. The &quot;possible&quot; status is not a very well supported one. But any findings, success or failures you encounter, you are very welcome to post it here or update the device page.</p>									</div>
