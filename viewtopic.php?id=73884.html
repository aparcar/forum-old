					<p>I&#039;m using something called SmarTTY.. it took me a while to figure out that I had to use the IP followed by a colon and then the port number 22 to get this to work. Then I had to figure out the password and now I&#039;m stuck at &quot;Cannot access .ssh directory&quot;. Have been researching this for two days but can&#039;t find any specific topics online about how to fix this in OpenWRT. So frustrating!</p>									</div>
