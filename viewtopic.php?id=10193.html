					<p>Is there anyone who can say with authority that on a wrt54gl (broadcom), there is no way in the foreseeable future that multiple ssid&#039;s will work properly with windows?</p><p>I think i understand that the problem is that while the access point can broadcast several ssid&#039;s, it doesn&#039;t virtualise the MAC address (BSSID?) and windows gets confused, but I can&#039;t see from the information i have read if this is a limitation of the broadcom chipset, or of the driver... I assume that if it was the former then we&#039;re stuck with it unless someone can come up with a very clever hack, but if it&#039;s the latter then it might be achievable...</p><p>thanks</p><p>james</p>									</div>

					<p>it is a driver limitation, multiple ssid&#039;s work with windows it just requires that you manually input the wireless settings at least in my limited testing</p>									</div>
