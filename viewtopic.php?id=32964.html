					<p>I have been working on a mesh networking project recently where I configure a singe radio to have an adhoc network and to provide an AP for client access. </p><p>In the past (bench testing and controlled outdoor tests) I&#039;ve have observed no trouble with ap+adhoc configuration.&nbsp; Recently I moved to an outdoor environment where 3 nodes are communicating over distances between 50-300m, and client devices are connected at each node.&nbsp; For concreteness, Imagine a right triangle where each corner is a node, and the sides adjacent to the right angle are 50m and 250m, respectively.&nbsp; All nodes see each other with reasonable signal strength (&gt;-65dB). </p><p>Diagram:</p><p>B<br />|\<br />|&nbsp; \<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp;\<br />A---C</p><br /><p>With any two nodes powered, there is no packet loss on the link.&nbsp; With all three nodes powered, the A-C link experiences &gt;95% packet loss, while A-B and B-C remain perfectly functional.&nbsp; (it is possible this only occurs when a client is connected to one of the APs).&nbsp; I have never experienced this before the 2011-11-01 compat-wireless package (last time I built the drivers was probably early september?)</p><p>Is there something that changed recently that might have caused the issue above?&nbsp; Suggestions on how to further debug / fix?</p><p>An interesting additional piece of data:&nbsp; OLSR believes that the link having 95% packet loss is perfectly fine, which suggests that OLSR &quot;hello&quot; messages are being sent and received successfully while other data, including ping, is not.</p><p>Thoughts anyone?</p>									</div>
