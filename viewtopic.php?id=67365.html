					<p>Hey guys,</p><p>Really hoping you can help - been searching for a while but can&#039;t figure this out.&nbsp; </p><p>I have a WRT1900AC.&nbsp; On the Linksys firmware, video files streamed fine.&nbsp; With OpenWrt, using miniDLNA, video files being streamed to my LG Blu-ray player show &quot;stretched&quot; - no black bar space on top/bottom, the video is instead stretched vertically.&nbsp; </p><p>I guess Linksys firmware uses Twonky media server.&nbsp; Is it possible to get this on Openwrt?&nbsp; Or is it possible to fix miniDLNA?</p><p>Any help is really appreciated!</p>									</div>

					<p>Might be helpful if you post your config <br />cat /etc/config/minidlna</p><p>I will take a wild guess, do you have strict dlna enabled?</p><p>Also have you tried playing with your TV settings?<br />Try playing the same file with PC, eg using VLC (open playlist, you can find UpNP players).</p>									</div>
