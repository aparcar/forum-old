					<p>I questioned on this forum but no one is able to guide me I don&#039;t know why this is called openwrt where you should need to get someone help to and people should need to help each other, I am trying to install squid 2.7 stable on my openwrt routerstation pro and I did install but I am facing some troubles with configuration like when I am trying to start squid it just come to the command prompt without letting any thing like squid started or not and when I am trying to check in IE browsing to put lan setting as proxy and it said proxy is not working. If I can make a script to start and stop squid then it give me the following message<br />squid: no running copy<br />please someone help me who did install squid 2.7 stable configuration to work with resolution please help me and share your configuration file so someone can get help with that. I will really appreciate anyones answer which can completely help me to resolve this matter. <br />Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>it did not help me at all, if you are using squid can i get the file so i can upload that on my router sor squid.conf so i will see because i tried alot of things to work but nothing helped, i tried to redirect my firewall to use external squid proxy and that is working fine but i have routerstation pro and i am willing to use router itself to work squid but i did not get any proper help. I will really appreciate if someone can help me to figure it out step by step so i can achieve this status as well. <br />Thanks</p>									</div>
