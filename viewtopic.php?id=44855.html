					<p>To begin with I would like to say that I love the flexibility and intuitiveness in the way OpenWrt is configured - Somebody has really done a good job there, thank you!</p><p>I am, however experiencing some instability problems with the wireless part which stops working after a day or so. No more broadcasting SSID and clients cannot connect.<br />I get this behavior on two different routers (same brand and model though) and believe that this rules out the possibility of the problem being caused by broken hardware. <br />The wired part keeps working fine - I can still log in to luci and if I make a scan in network-&gt;wifi-&gt;wireless overview the wireless part starts working again, broadcasting SSID and allowing clients to connect.</p><p>The setup:<br />HW: TP-Link TL-WR740N v.4.20<br />SW: OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment 12.09 / LuCI 0.11.1 Release (0.11.1)</p><p>Has anyone any idea what is going on in my routers?<br />Or better yet; Does anyone know how to fix this problem?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Christian</p>									</div>

					<p>There is unfortunately a bug in openwrt, all atheros tp links I have are affected <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> There is something going on, someone is trying to fix it, but it is still not fixed. You can try compile latest build, which should make wifi more stable.</p><p>When you find dead wifi, you can look for error messages with commands dmesg and logread. Then post the error here or into google and you will see. This wifi bug makes me frenzy, on some routers I have uptime more than 100 days, but I need to restart wifi once every while <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the fast reply.<br />I&#039;ve been reading tickets - The problems described in this one seems similar to what I experience: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/12372">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/12372</a><br />I wonder if the temporary fix (disabling Adaptive Noise Immunity) mentioned by Roland Pallai would do the trick for me...<br />Maybe I should give it a try...</p>									</div>

					<p>It would be fine if more of the developers would concentrate onto this, because this makes openwrt quite unusable. I don&#039;t know how could they release AA 12.09 as final and stable, when it is far from both of words <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> Openwrt is better than stock firmware, but in the country of the blind, the one-eyed man is king...</p><p>Could you please fill with the bug report? Maybe if more people will be complaining, the more attention it gets.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 24 Jun 2013, 23:50)</p>
