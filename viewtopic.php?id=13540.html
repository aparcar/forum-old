					<p>Just spent an afternoon awaking my &quot;bricked&quot; WLA-G54 (Buffalo AirStation AP).&nbsp; Eveytime I flash it with Kamikaze, it seems to stop working.&nbsp; Eventually I figured out that it&#039;s trying to BOOTP/DHCP on the internal LAN port.&nbsp; I tried the firmware made for WBR-G54 (the router from Buffalo) but it didn&#039;t work either.&nbsp; Eventually I tried to ping the 192.168.1.1 (from 192.168.1.10) and saw the router do ARP request on 192.168.1.10 but with VLAN tag 0.</p><p>The following applies to other router/APs that don&#039;t have the same VLAN configuration as the default Broadcom dist:</p><p>1.&nbsp; Use a linux box (software based vlan using vconfig, easy) or find a NIC on Windows (only Gigabit cards support it, seems) that support VLAN tagging and create an interface with VLAN tag 0</p><p>2. Set the IP address on that vlan tag to 192.168.1.10</p><p>3. Connect to your router/ap and ping 192.168.1.1, if you get a response: you can just telnet/ssh in and change your /etc/config/networks accordingly, using this link as a hint:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Configuration#head-b62c144b9886b221e0c4b870edb0dd23a7b6acab">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Con â€¦ 23a7b6acab</a></p><p>Good luck</p>									</div>
