					<p>So you set the default gateway to the one you get from you vpn access concentrator? Is this really necessary? Usually you would apply a set of special routes provided by the access concentrator to reach the network behind the VPN.</p><p>e.g.</p><p>ip r a 10.0.0.0/8 via (GW) dev tap0</p><p>would apply a route that lets all traffic to the internal network 10/8 flow thruh your vpn connection.</p><p>YOU CAN, in opposite, set the default gateway to you VPN peer too. But this usually does only make sense if you wan&#039;t to tunnel all you internet traffic thruh your vpn peer.</p><p>If you use pull, you peer would suggest all routes you should apply, if it pushes a 0.0.0.0/0 route all traffic will be redirected thruh your vpn, after the connection has been set up. To circumvent this I woudl suggest removing the pull from you ovpn config and instead add &#039;route&#039; options manually, but you would have to observe which IP networks will have to be routed thruh your vpn.</p><p>In general the routing is done as following:</p><p>1. get the most specific route matching your target (e.g. your target is 192.168.1.5)<br />Imagine you have the following routes</p><p>1 192.168.0.0/16 via 1.2.3.4 dev wan0<br />2 192.168.1.0/24 via 3.4.5.6 dev eth0<br />3 192.168.1.5/32 via 4.5.6.7 dev tap0</p><p>This would pick (3)</p><p>2. if there is more than one rule with the same network address pick the one with the lowest metric</p><p>imagine this:</p><p>1 192.168.1.5/32 via 4.5.6.7 dev tap0 metric 10<br />2 192.168.1.5/32 via 7.8.9.10 dev eth0 metric 1</p><p>this would pick (2)</p><p>What you now have to ensure is that a route to your dest exists which has the highest priority and is not using your vpn connection. To set up static routing tables which many many destination ip addresses and networks for e.g. paypal, ebay, google and so on does not seem very handy. You have noone whou may provide any information about which ip addresses to setr up in your routes. You MIGHT ask dns but such big players tend to apply a lot of load balancing tricks and hand out different ip adresses any time you request. So I would suggest to not set the default gw to your vpn peer but only a few necessary rules.</p><p>IF YOU NEED TO set the default via OVPN, than I would suggest to look out for the possibility to trigger special commands from the dns server. E.g. someone looks up blubb.paypal.com you could trigger setting up a route for the returning IP address. But as far as I remember neither dnsmasq nor bind is currently able to do something like that for you. I have been dealing with a similar problem some time ago and I was not able to do so. </p><p>Alternatively you could simply set up a proxy server and use source routing for the local ip and port of the proxy. So say yould would add a route that is specifying any packet leaving the proxy server (on the router) will become routed thruh your WAN peer. This is a very specific rule and will always become chosen, but you would have to set up the proxy server for your peers. If you specify different sender ip addresses within e.g. squid you can direct some traffic thruh one interface ans some traffic thruh another one. This is possile with squid. (But sill all your peers have to use the proxy). You cannot use a transparent proxy rule as you will want to direct ssl traffic thruh it and setting up a transparent proxy server for ssl traffic is kind of man in the middle attack and (usually) impossible.</p>									</div>
