					<p>I wanted a simple DNS-based ad blocking solution.</p><p>I set up uHTTPd to respond with a 1x1 pixel transparent gif for any invalid page requests.

This script could be run with cron, or by hand like so:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/bin/sh /etc/adblock.sh</code></pre></div><p>Take a look at /etc/hosts.block to see the result. Next I replaced the contents of /etc/dnsmasq.conf with the following:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>addn-hosts=/etc/hosts.block
all-servers
bogus-priv
domain-needed
no-resolv
server=8.8.8.8
server=8.8.4.4</code></pre></div><p>It adds the contents of /etc/hosts.block to the local DNS. All that is needed is to restart Dnsmasq:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart</code></pre></div><p>Now browsing the web (with or without a ad block browser extension) will result in a much cleaner browsing experience. It&#039;ll also be faster since the requests for ads will be handled locally.</p><p>The drawbacks are that many web sites out there depend on ad revenue and with this solution, you&#039;d be depriving them of that revenue. Also, &quot;sponsored&quot; ads in Google searches don&#039;t work, but usually the URL can be modified to get to the expected site. Other than that, I&#039;ve been using this solution in my home for several years, albeit with DD-WRT, Pixelserv, and Dnsmasq. Now that I&#039;ve switched to OpenWRT, it&#039;s a much simpler solution than I&#039;m used to.&nbsp; :-)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ptb</strong> on 23 May 2015, 05:22)</p>

					<p>You&#039;re right, it should be a background daemon.&nbsp; When I was running dnsmasq on Mac OS X, I used that directive to keep it from backgrounding so launchd could manage it. On OpenWRT, it should be removed.</p><p>- Peter</p>									</div>

I am a new member to this forum, but have followed the forum for quite some time. I was able to implement your DNS technique here a few months ago and it has been very successful as far as ad-blocking goes. Very efficient and fast as well. Web browsing has been great now since I don&#039;t have to rely on ad-blocking browser extensions slowing things down.</p><p>Not only have I implemented your technique for DNS ad-blocking, but in addition, I have also pointed the DNS servers at Norton DNS (ConnectSafe) to let Symantec do the heavy lifting as far as malware DNS filtering goes. It has been a great solution thus far and I will stick to it for a long time. Thank you so much for sharing. Cheers!</p>									</div>
