					<p>Hello,</p><p>I recently bought a TP-Link TL-WDR4300 v1.6 and flashed it with the trunk version of BB (r38031). I&#039;m using it in Germany. It&#039;s running fine (stable), but there are two problems:</p><p>1) Wireless transmit power is a bit low, both at 2.4GHz (19dBm at ch. 13) and 5GHz (14dBm at ch. 36). Both interfaces are actually set to 20dBm (and that additionally shouldn&#039;t be the limit on 5GHz because 200mW are allowed in DE, but it is the highest value possible in LuCI).<br />Is someone here knowing the impediment?</p><p>2) I would like to enable DFS on 5 GHz to use higher channels (100 and above), where 27dBm transmit power are permitted here (else the wireless range is really small).<br />Actually it looks like DFS is already working (output of iw, also read it was implemented recently in trunk), but I can&#039;t select channels higher than 48. If I set it manually in /etc/config/wireless, then the interface won&#039;t go up.<br />Maybe someone can tell me how this is configurable?</p><p>/etc/config/wireless:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-device &#039;radio0&#039;

					<p>Hello Mikey,<br />I&#039;m sorry, I haven&#039;t figured out any better yet. Also deleted the binaries of the nightly I was using, sorry... Wish you luck. I&#039;ll probably drop 5GHz support and get another TL-WR1043ND, which is working fine for me.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m running BB 38995 with reghack on WDR4300v1.6 for over a week now, and I&#039;m not having any wireless problems.&nbsp; I am NOT using the firewall or the WAN port -- just using a LAN port to connect to my firewall router running AA 12.09, so the WDR4300 is strictly a radio access point to the LAN which has another firewalled router to get to the internet.</p><p>Luci reports 22dBm on the 2.4Ghz radio (US, channel 6, force 40MHz above), and 19dBm on the 5.7Ghz radio (channel 149, force 40Mhz above).</p><p>On one of my Windows 8.1 laptops I had to go into the adapter properties to enable 40Mhz speeds (why driver did not default to that I have no idea, or whether it is a negotiation problem with Openwrt).</p><p>With a 2x2 mimo laptop around 20ft from router, I get reported connection rates of 270Mbits to 300Mbits.&nbsp; Actual measured throughput pulling large file over LAN using SMB I see over 120Mbit sustained actual throughput over both 2.4Ghz and 5.7Ghz (each measured separately).</p><p>WDR4300 router uptime now at 7days since I last rebooted it with no wireless dropouts or slowdowns.&nbsp; I have about eight devices connected wirelessly, ranging from iPod, android, internet radio (Linux), Tivo, and Windows, most on 2.4Ghz.&nbsp; I did purchase some larger antennae (9.5dbi), and the range throughout my house on 2.4Ghz is better than the Buffalo G300NH I was using with AA 12.09, but that could be due mostly to the larger antennae.</p><p>I have heard some suspect issues with ethernet switch performance (I&#039;m only using single LAN port and no WAN port), and firewall (mine is disabled), so I don&#039;t know if those problems are what is underneath the problems others are having with performance.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello tmcg,<br />I&#039;m also using it only as Wireless AP. I&#039;ve reconfigured the switch so that the WAN port is actually a LAN port. Firewall is also disabled. 5GHz is problematic here in Germany because of DFS which seems to be not properly supported up to now. And 2.4GHz is suboptimal because of the internal antennas with small gain compared to the TL-WR1043ND. But maybe I&#039;ll check it again in the new year with an actual build.</p><p>We are using this in a dormitory as half-public hotspot with 2 to 12 devices simultaneously ranging from iPod, iPhone, iPad and Android Phones/Tablets/Phablets to multiple kinds of laptops.<br />In another sector we are using a TL-WR1043ND and this one is running fine with the same amount of devices.</p>									</div>

					<p>Mogli, I am using 9.5 dbi gain antennae (amazon $15 part B00DMJI9TA) which seems to help 2.4Ghz range significantly, less help for 5Ghz.&nbsp; I&#039;m not certain about this, but if your WDR4300 unit EEPROM is DE instead of US, then reghack might not help you as I understand it only removes software limits up to EEPROM hard coded limits for snapshot builds.&nbsp; If you have firewall disabled anyway, just plug into any LAN port for &quot;uplink&quot; to internet device -- it bridges just fine unless you really need the 5th port.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey tcmg,<br />if I recognize it correctly in the wiki (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300</a>) then the external antennas are only connected to 5Ghz. So probably only 5Ghz should be affected by the antennae <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> Antennae for 2.4GHz couldn&#039;t be seen at all - probably they are on the other side of the PCB. Maybe I&#039;ll open the case somewhen and soldier some high-gain antennae to the 2.4GHz connectors.</p><p>In the EEPROM are hardcoded limits in the driver binaries so that you shouldn&#039;t could &quot;overdrive&quot; the wireless. But these aren&#039;t correct values and TP-Link implemented all this in the Firmware ignoring the EEPROM settings. OpenWRT itself refers to EEPROM because of legal issues, so it only allows what is marked as allowed in the EEPROM. Because they are not correct you could overwrite them with reghack so that the limits are removed - but the user should know what he does. The EEPROM is the same around the world which causes these problems - I&#039;ve currently also set the regulatory zone to US because reghack only modifies US.</p><p>I know that it would work when I put it in the LAN port... but sometimes we have technically inexperienced people thinking the cable should be in WAN - so I configured the switch to be all LAN <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> So it doesn&#039;t matter where the cable is plugged in. Works also flawlessly on my TL-WR1043ND where I did it before because I needed all five ports.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ah thanks n8raider, that sounds like a solution. Maybe then the WDR4300 will fit my needs <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> Will try this also after christmas.</p>									</div>
