					<p>Hi friends, I&#039;ve been having an issue for the past few nights, while following these guides trying to build with CJDNS:<br /><a href="https://mesh.neoretro.net/wiki/Pages/cjdns-openwrt/">https://mesh.neoretro.net/wiki/Pages/cjdns-openwrt/</a><br /><a href="https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns-openwrt">https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns-openwrt</a></p><p>It&#039;s taken me awhile to figure out who I needed to actually talk to about this, lo and behold! <br />-this seems to be the best place! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /> yes? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>So, I believe I just discovered what the issue is.</p><p><strong>Did by chance someone set trunk for BCM47XX/53XX to only make CHK images for netgear only?</strong></p><p>If so, then I can confirm, it does work for WRT54G-TM, with the BCM5352.</p><p>This is what status says:<br />&quot;Unknown Board&quot;<br />&quot;OpenWrt Barrier Breaker r38314 / LuCI Trunk (svn-r9915)&quot;<br />&quot;3.10.13&quot;<br />&quot;Tue Oct 8 09:39:29 2013&quot;<br />&quot;1h 56m 10s&quot;<br />&quot;2.24, 0.75, 0.30&quot;<br />&quot;16604 kB / 29084 kB (57%)&quot;<br />&quot;5572 kB / 29084 kB (19%)&quot;<br />&quot;9380 kB / 29084 kB (32%)&quot;<br />&quot;1628 kB / 29084 kB (5%)&quot;<br />this is with nano and LUCi installed after flash.</p><br /><p>So yeh, I&#039;m building for a WRT54G-TM, with a BCM5352, and I&#039;m only getting CHK images, which now completely makes sense. But I can&#039;t use em.</p><p><strong>maybe I can just edit something on my side so that it makes BIN and TRX?</strong></p><p>[background]</p><p>Last night I was in IRC chatting with Marcell about this, trying to figure out what a chk image is for. </p><p>During this, Marcell told me he would build for BCM47XX, I&#039;m quite new to this and had a bunch of trouble figuring out some basic things, but now I have conquered and I sucessfuly flashed this image from trunk:<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/brcm47xx/openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ â€¦ uashfs.bin</a></p><br /><p>and it works very well. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><br /><p>So, I came here to try and sort this out, do some recon so I don&#039;t trouble anyone but then I noticed this:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=46659">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=46659</a><br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>I just inherited a WGR614 v8, aka Netgear WGR614L. <strong> Since Trunk now builds openwrt-wgr614_v8-squashfs.chk </strong> in <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/brcm47xx/,">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/brcm47xx/,</a> I wonder...<br />1. Does anyone know how well the image works with WGR614 v8?<br />2. How to flash the image?<br />3. In case I brick it, how to bring it back to its stock firmware?<br />Thanks in advance.</p></blockquote></div><p>I didn&#039;t quite realize it at the time but during my previous searches I realized the chk images are needed for updating netgear routers, as for some reason they can&#039;t use BIN and TRX. </p><br /><p>So now I&#039;m kind of stuck trying to figure out how to make the bin and trx.<br />Does this need to happen by someone else, ie it&#039;s complex? or can I just edit a line or two on my side?</p><p>TL;DR how can I make BIN and TRX from trunk for BCM47XX/53XX?</p><p>TIA</p>									</div>
