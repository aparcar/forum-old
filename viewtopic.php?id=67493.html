					<p>I can VPN in to my router at home, which I currently do via the built-in VPN software in Windows 10. This is fine, except that I would rather have a mini router which I can take away to hotels which will automatically connect to the VPN at home and provide a secure wifi connection (via the hotel ethernet/guest wifi).</p><p>Is this something I can do via OpenWrt? I remember trying this a few years ago with a mini TP-Link travel router but couldn&#039;t get it working. Can I make it so that the internet is blocked if the VPN goes down or fails to connect?</p><p>If this is possible, which hardware would you recommend (ideally something available in the UK). The GL-AR300M sounds like it&#039;s popular on here.</p>									</div>

					<p>You can do this and the GL-AR300M is one of the most robust devices in it&#039;s class.</p><p>VPN is an add on for standard OpenWrt (packages required), but GL.inet has built some of this into their GUI.&nbsp; I am not aware of anyone using this with a home server, but standard functionality works as a fall back plan.&nbsp; Their current implementation only supports TUN.</p><p>Many have requested the fall back features you are looking for, but I am not aware of anyone writing a scripts that do so and are published.</p><p>As a traveler you may be interested in this site:&nbsp; <a href="https://www.hotelwifitest.com/">https://www.hotelwifitest.com/</a><br />Unfortunately these devices are all a small fraction of the computing power of a PC and VPN runs slower than on a PC.&nbsp; With a good connection you may get speeds in the lower teens, but running wireless you are probably less.&nbsp; The real issue is the speeds available in hot spots, which becomes a gating factor, and then you get some fraction of that with VPN on top.</p>									</div>
