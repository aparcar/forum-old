					<p>Hello everyone. Please help me out with this because i am really new with OpenWrt and i dont know how to fix it. My setup is as follows:</p><p>ADSL router provides internet</p><p>An access point (TP-LINK WA901ND) with the corresponding version of OpenWrt is connected to one of the ports of the ADSL router.</p><p>In order to proceed and load the GUI i need to download LUCI but the problem is that the AP doesnt have internet! I followed every tutorial i found in the internet but nothing. I attached some pics in order to show the properties as well as what king of commands i typed. </p><p>/etc/config/network<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://s9.postimg.org/mog8tvzbj/network.jpg" alt="PunBB bbcode test" /></span></p><p>/etc/config/wireless<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://s22.postimg.org/r1zyfbz75/wifi.jpg" alt="PunBB bbcode test" /></span></p><p>finally<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://s21.postimg.org/9co1msanb/commands.jpg" alt="PunBB bbcode test" /></span></p><p>but as you can see i still dont have internet through AP. The weirdest part is that through WIFi from AP if i get connected from a PC i have internet in the PC without any problems but for me i just want to have internet in the AP in order to download LUCI. Any ideas?</p>									</div>
