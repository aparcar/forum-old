					<p>Hi Folks,</p><p>I have a Rosewill RNX-GX4. It&#039;s got a BCM5354 Broadcom chip with 4MB of serial flash. I&#039;m currently running Openwrt version 10.3.</p><p>I have a system that I want to back up. My plan is to create a .trx image and then use that to burn other routers. My process seems to work fine, except when I restore the image to a new router, I&#039;ve noticed that the image has overwritten the MAC address on the new unit. I then end up with multiple units with the same MAC address, which is not good. I do know how to reprogram the MAC using nvram set, and nvram commit commands, but I would prefer not to do this. Is there a way to prevent this? In other words, create a .trx image without including the nvram area.</p><p>Thanks<br />Shawn</p><br /><p>Here is my flash information:</p><p>dmesg:</p><p>Creating 5 MTD partitions on &quot;sflash&quot;:<br />0x00000000-0x00020000 : &quot;cfe&quot;<br />0x00020000-0x003f0000 : &quot;linux&quot;<br />0x0009c000-0x00230000 : &quot;rootfs&quot;<br />mtd: partition &quot;rootfs&quot; doesn&#039;t start on an erase block boundary --<br />force read-only<br />0x003f0000-0x00400000 : &quot;nvram&quot;<br />0x00230000-0x003f0000 : &quot;rootfs_data&quot;</p><br /><p>Command that I&#039;m using to create the .trx image on a remote machine:</p><p>ssh -l root 192.168.2.109 -C &#039;mount -o remount,ro /dev/mtdblock/4<br />/overlay ; dd if=/dev/mtdblock/3 ; mount -o remount,rw /dev/mtdblock/4<br />/overlay&#039; &gt; backup.trx</p>									</div>
