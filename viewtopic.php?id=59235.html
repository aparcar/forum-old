					<p>Hi, I have WDR4300 which was bricked. I followed the procedure to enter failsafe and make factory reset. Then I remembered that when I bought this router I&#039;ve installed only squashfs-factory version. 2 months the router was working excellent since I bought it. Now I have upgraded the firmware to sysupgrade version. SYS_LED is not blinking - just it lights constantly. Is this normal? I have reflashed to OpenWRT from stock many routers like WDR3600, TP-Link WR841ND, I have them in one hotel adn they&#039;re working nonstop without any problem! Do you have guys problem with this router before? I think I&#039;m going to buy Mikrotik RB951. This thing just drives me crazy how good and stable it is. And ofcourse it&#039;s with very long range! Thank you.</p>									</div>
