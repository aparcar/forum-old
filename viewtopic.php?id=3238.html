					<p>The tutorial mentions the following:</p><p>echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/forwarding</p><p>unfortunately that file is read-only and I seem to be unable to write 1 into that file (also trying to chmod it doesn&#039;t work, vi also won&#039;t write the changes)</p><p>I&#039;m at the point where I can ping6 localhost on the router, but pinging e.g. <a href="http://www.kame.net">www.kame.net</a> only resolves the ipv6 address, the icmp packets never get through it seems.</p><p>Does anyone know how to fix this?<br />Thanks in advance, Thomas</p>									</div>

					<p>I also have another problem, the tutorial has a sample file /etc/init.d/S42tun6to4 that contains the following:</p><p># retrieve the public IPv4 address<br />ipv4=`ip -4 addr | awk &#039;/^[0-9]+[:] vlan1[:]/ {l=NR+1} /inet (([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3})\// {if (NR == l) split($2,a,&quot;/&quot;)} END {print a[1]}&#039;`</p><p>Unfortunately this doesn&#039;t work at all. I tried using ppp0 instead of vlan1 (ip -4 addr lists my public IP in ppp0), but that also doesn&#039;t work. Only setting ipv4=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx worked, but I only have a dynamic IP.</p>									</div>

					<p>You have to add the default IPv6 routes for your openwrt router, so that it can pings <a href="http://www.kame.net">www.kame.net</a> in IPv6, and propagate the good routes to autoconfigured LAN machines :</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ip route add ::/0 dev ppp0                                        
ip route add 2000::/3 dev ppp0</code></pre></div><p>According ppp0 is your 6to4 interface. Is your radvd daemon well configured ?</p>									</div>

					<p>I configured radvd as described in the howto.</p><p>I added the two lines to my ip-up script, but that doesn&#039;t look like it helped. Btw, it for some reason doesn&#039;t find any routes in my LAN anymore, except to localhost (lo). But not because of these changes though.</p>									</div>
