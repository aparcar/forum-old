					<p>Hello,<br />Has anybody tried to add more antennas to a Asus 500gp ? </p><p>The AP mode for 802.11n should be &quot;soon&quot; ready so I&#039;m thinking about buying a 802.11n miniPCI. Since 802.11n uses the MIMO technology, it needs several antennas. So I was wandering if anyone has already done this hack.&nbsp; Technically, it us just a matter of drilling the holes into the box cos the miniPCI cards already have pigtails connectors but I&#039;d like to do it properly <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Thanks<br />,<br />TEx</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Tex-Twil</strong> on 11 Aug 2008, 18:28)</p>

					<p>I&#039;ve successfully added the second antenna. As you say, it&#039;s easy. Just open the case and drill a 6mm hole next to the power connector, buy a pigtail and you&#039;re done. You&#039;ll lose warranty, but I suppose you already know this :-)<br />I made some photos: <a href="http://89.248.241.82/index.php?entry=entry090120-154304">http://89.248.241.82/index.php?entry=entry090120-154304</a> and click on &quot;Cti dal...:&quot; to see them.

					<p>Cool thanks. BTW I do speak czech as well <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> The thing is that I now use the Apple Airport Express as access point bridged to my openwrt so I don&#039;t need anymore the 802.11n on it.</p><p>cauky,<br />Tex</p>									</div>
