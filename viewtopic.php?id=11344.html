					<p>It&#039;s a case of being &quot;good enough&quot;. The MAX233 will actually function fine at the 3.3V level even if it&#039;s not technically the right choice.&nbsp; Probably it&#039;s what some guy had on hand doing the first projects years ago.</p><p>I prefer the FTDI USB-console solution now anyhow, my MAX233 kit is gathering dust.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have some Sipex chips in the junkbox but they&#039;re 5V too and need a lot of support.&nbsp; I used to use a Dallas chip years ago that gets negative voltage off the data line (no charge pump) - another &quot;good enough&quot; category. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>By the way,<br />before I got a siemens c55 rs-232 cable I found the MAX3233E, which doesn&#039;t need capacitors when I read right. Has someone tried the chip before and knows where to get it in germany?</p><p>Torsten</p>									</div>

					<p>I had a siemens s45 cable and it was ok with the linksys devices. After that I bought SonyEricsson and the data cable (costs about â‚¬5) has pl2303 (serial to usb). I soldered 3 wires to the PCB that was &quot;in&quot; the cable (RX,TX and GND)</p>									</div>

					<p>I have been trying to make the console and breadboard for weeks. I have made the serial cable correctly but am having trouble putting it all together on the breadboard. I am no electric engineer.&nbsp; I have a big picture of my breadboard can someone maybe label where rx, tx, GND and capacitors go on the board with MS paint or something.&nbsp; I spent around $35 for all the parts, could of bought another router for like half on the bay. I needs this idiot proofed. If someone is interested in doing this or sending a pic of the wired and ready to go breadboard, think this would help many people. This is in relation to WGT624 v.2</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>next4nextel</strong> on 6 Jan 2008, 02:15)</p>
