I am a previous DD-WRT/Tomato user, liked it for its simplicity but those are simply not stable. Is there a tutorial for SSH based around LEDE that you know of? While searching I couldn&#039;t find anything great. I think I&#039;d have to enable SSH functionally or get a client for it, not sure, like I said I&#039;m pretty oblivious.

					<p>I do not know what the developers are doing there, but from the firmware to the firmware it becomes only worse these endless throwing and improvements to the wi-fi only make things worse for me.
