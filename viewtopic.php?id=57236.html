					<p>I am interested in exactly the same thing:<br />&nbsp; <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=57001">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=57001</a></p><p>I had (I think it was exactly this model) since long:<br />&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/TP-LINK-TL-ANT2409A-Directional-Antenna-connector/dp/B003CFATNS">http://www.amazon.com/TP-LINK-TL-ANT240 … B003CFATNS</a><br />Complete crap (admittedly, when I read the reviews on amazon I get confused).</p><p>I tried to build a &quot;windsurfer&quot; and add it to my current antennas. No succes, but perhaps the dimensions were not good for the WDR3600 antennas.</p><p>I have two longer 2.4GHz only antennas that I will try soon.</p><p>However, if I could find or build 5GHz antennas that would be better. I&#039;ll try to keep you updated if I find something.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zo0ok</strong> on 8 May 2015, 14:46)</p>
