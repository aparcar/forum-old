end

function action_base()
 luci.template.render(&quot;admin_testapp/testapp&quot;)
end</code></pre></div><p>and your template</p><p>/usr/lib/lua/luci/view/admin_testapp/testapp.htm<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>&lt;%+header%&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;%:Hello World%&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;%+footer%&gt;</code></pre></div><p>use winscp add the files to the directories above and then reboot or do as arfett suggested and delete the /tmp/luci-indexcache file and the /tmp/luci-modulecahce<br />directory and the &quot;TestApp&quot; tab will appear with the &quot;Base&quot; sub tab, clicking on either one should render your template.</p><p>To add this to the build, untill you get comforable with cutom building i suggest you just add the directory structure and the files to the &quot;files&quot; directory at the root level of the openwrt src (create it if its not there) files in this directory will be added post build <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

					<p>hostle19 has some good config suggestions for the controller file. I was going to let you learn more about that on your own but gave you a package that will show up on menuconfig as well as the LuCI display.</p><p>To learn more about what is possible on the menus I actually recommend taking a look at the existing modules built into LuCI and base your configurations on those.</p><p>Also I maintain a LuCI package for the mwan3 package which I mixed and matched a lot of things I learned from other packages if you want to see how I made my package. If you wanted to do that you would install the luci-app-mwan3 package so you can see it live and then view the code that makes it work here: <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/packages/tree/master/net/mwan3-luci">https://github.com/openwrt/packages/tre â€¦ mwan3-luci</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>arfett</strong> on 1 Mar 2015, 23:13)</p>

					<p>arfett,<br />thank you very much, your gz is working! It&#039;s a very good point to start from. It&#039;s a bit strange anyway that this doc <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/luci">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/luci</a>&nbsp; is quite misleading and misses out some important info.<br />The test method without building the entire firmware is very useful, saves a lot of time.</p><p>hostle19,<br />these hints also seems to be very handy, thank you!</p>									</div>
