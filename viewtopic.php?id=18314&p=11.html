					<p>Hello forum,</p><p>I have flashed several trunks to my Dir-615-C1 but was not able to customize those builds due to packages I&#039;m trying to install are too big. So I was wondering if these could be built into a flash build without becoming too large to flash?</p><p>Packages I have: uShare, libdlna, Palantir, RTPproxy, and libdvbpsi. (there&#039;s no room for a webui with the trunk I started with but I think I can still configure it with WinSCP?) These were opkg installed on fratzicu&#039;s build: <a href="http://cid-28edcbba0b0ec4b1.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/.Public/OpenWrt-Kamikaze-TEW-632-BRP/Kamikaze-r17590-bare-test-jaunty-64-15-09-09/openwrt-ar71xx-tew-632brp-squashfs.uni">http://cid-28edcbba0b0ec4b1.skydrive.li … uashfs.uni</a>&nbsp; One problem it seems to helped was the local graphics and menu navigation over HD streamed video but it still isn&#039;t without fault and application is beta test s/w on my home entertainment system.</p><p>Packages I would like to include in a flash build in addition to the ones above are: mrd6 and Freeswitch-mod-local-stream. And the webui if possible, in the order of preference if one is inclined to try.</p><p>These packages are mostly A/V streaming packages and may be over-kill but I&#039;m testing a beta application that is not supported so I&#039;m not sure which one to go with without multiple flashes to narrow it down. I&#039;m not using any IPv4 to v6 tunneling, bittorent, or even wireless with this router if that helps any.</p><p>I&#039;m thinking that once these are added to the necessary packages, it will not fit within a safe flash uni, is that correct?</p>									</div>

At that point I disconnect power to router and cable modem, reset my PC to obtain DHCP IP address, restart the cable modem, then reconnect power to my router. It reboots with openwrt and sends DHCP IP addresses with no problem.</p><p>The newer trunks do not have a webui in the flash, so I telnet in the new IP from the PC Command Prompt (telnet 192.168.1.1, enter) and then opkg update/opkg install luci-admin-full/opkg install luci-fastindex/opkg install luci-theme-openwrt (or luci-theme-openwrtlight for retaining more flash space for packages). I install these as a minimum to get a webui then I start testing different packages by using the opkg install &lt;pkg&gt; -test (to see if the package will install due to limited flash left and install based on test results and trial and error).</p><p>Doesn&#039;t sound like your router is bricked but maybe the step you omitted was disconnecting power after flashing openwrt, unless I&#039;m the one skipping steps...I&#039;m new at this too but these steps I&#039;ve done repeatedly trying to find a package and trunk that fits my needs.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the help armchair <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />&nbsp; I guess I should have added that when I do the recover console, it stops at 54% and takes me to a page not found.&nbsp; I looked through the code but didn&#039;t find any sort of redirect code, so I&#039;m not sure why it&#039;s doing that.&nbsp; I am using IE.&nbsp; I was wondering why it didn&#039;t get to 100%, but even with the D-Link firmware, it only goes to 54% and then it boots and is correct.&nbsp; On that note, it isn&#039;t bricked, because I am always able to get back to the D-Link firmware...it&#039;s just being odd.</p>									</div>

					<p>So just to add to what I was doing.&nbsp; I put the firmware on the router.&nbsp; Give it some time to complete (since it doesn&#039;t get to 100% but that still works with the standard DLink firmware).&nbsp; Pull the power and make sure that the interface is set to DHCP.&nbsp; Then I get nothing.&nbsp; Set the IP static back to 192.168.0.2, and I get the Recovery Interface.</p>									</div>

I found it a comfortable environment as well. If I were more comfortable with script setups and editing, I would have no use for Luci either. Unfortunately, I still need a user interface to configure ports for forwarded packets. I would welcome any advice on that. If I ever get to the point where I can build my own f/w, I may save my configuration and rebuild another and transfer the scripts on a custom build w/o a webui.</p><p>But I wonder if I&#039;m the only one experiencing a loss of flash space by removing packages to &quot;make more room&quot; for others as the poster described? For example, I removed the ones mentioned in the post and some others because I was trying to make even more room to customize and ran into a space problem sooner rather than later when trying opkg install after opkg remove. IMO or experience, I&#039;m not realizing a gain in flash space by removing or even trying to force an overwrite of the unwanted package. I&#039;m under the impression that if I want to customize in this manner, it would require a build rather than modifying a pre-built trunk. Am I right on this theory or am I doing something wrong?</p><p>maksym, I find your posts useful and think it could help newcomers. I do not not intend to question the validity of your source, I was only intending to use the reference as an opportunity to ask my question. And to direct my question to the forum members with knowledge and experience to guide me.</p>									</div>

I picked DIR-615 because it was so cheap ($20) for an N-300 router. I did not do a research on it before I went to the store. Later I found out that DIR-615 (like other routers from D-Link) does not work well with VoIP. I just could not make a call using Linksys PAP2T through DIR-615 router even if I put in DMZ. For unknown reason, the original DIR-615 firmwares (v3.10 &amp; 3.11NA) block port 5060 and there is noway I could open it. That brings me to this forum as the only alternative DIR-615 firmware available to date. To make the story short, last Monday I compiled OpenWRT firmware using r18957 following steps in <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=81494">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=81494</a><br />which appeared to be very simple. I am a novice and have no previous experience at all with openwrt. I have a running Ubuntu machine to start with, anyway. It took a while though for me to find where the .uni file is located, which is in bin/ directory. Last night I flashed the DIR-615 and played with LUCI for the configuration. However, SSH did not allow me to login after I set a password from LUCI. The password should be set through telnet while the password is still blank if you want to have an SSH root access. So far so good with r18957, and I am going to test it with VoIP, hopefully during the New Year&#039;s break.</p>									</div>

It seems with the memory space limitation, one can either focus on a build with either wired or wireless application but there may not be enough memory to customize.

I think I found another note stating my 32 bit processor on my Linux station was not going to work as a build station so I&#039;ll use the snapshots for now. The quote below is from the Gargoyle site and states the need for libopenssl... Maybe this will help someone here...</p><p>&quot;Before you begin installation on a broadcom router you should verify that you have ~800kb of free space available, or ~2.0Mb on an atheros router. That&#039;s how much space gargoyle, along with all of it&#039;s dependencies requires. Atheros requires so much more space because it requires libopenssl (which is HUGE) to enable WPA wireless encryption.&quot;</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>armchair</strong> on 8 Jan 2010, 08:52)</p>

					<p>Hello, and happy new year.</p><p>I would like to answer to some of your discussions:</p><p>1) the updating procedure (at least with my .uni files) from the emergency webui (the one with the DLINK DIR text) sometimes doesn&#039;t work with all the browsers. It works best with internet explorer. ALso, when you make the flash, the emergency router ip is from the class 192.168.10.x, and the updated firmware gives you by dhcp an IP from the class 192.168.1.x. So this could be a problem for the browser, it can&#039;t acess the page anymore after the flash. Also, if you have a static IP, you can&#039;t connect anymore to the router. Best, you have to set the IP to be taken automatically, and repair it after flashing to take the new class IP.</p><p>2) Now I use the r12615 firmware from my sites I shared, It is very stable, but it hasn&#039;t n speed. Also, the last firmwares I compiled should work, but it is a problem with the settings backup-restore which doesn&#039;t work, so I am too lousy to manually reintroduce them, so I stick with the older firmware.</p><p>3)when you select too many packages, obviously the firmware image becomes too large for the 4 mb available. You have to select only the packaes you need most. Also, I think the 400 mHz processor of the device couldn&#039;t handle many running programs. In our era, the mb space is not a problem, so I can&#039;t understand why they made the space so little - 4 mb, and only 16 mb of ram. But I guess to discourage the slow working with more packages. Who knows? I guess the next gneration routers would have better processors - 1 ghz, more space, etc, and n and gbit speed.</p><p>I reccommend you to compile a new image for your needs, but containing only networking tools, not many applications. I invite you to use my compiled firmwares, and comment them where you find space.</p><p>Dedicated website:<br /><a href="http://sites.google.com/site/fratzicu/news/compiledkamikazer18880">http://sites.google.com/site/fratzicu/n … kazer18880</a></p><p>Complete set of compiled firmware images and compiled packages:<br /><a href="http://cid-28edcbba0b0ec4b1.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/.Public/OpenWrt-Kamikaze-TEW-632-BRP">http://cid-28edcbba0b0ec4b1.skydrive.li … EW-632-BRP</a><br />From here you can also download and install the packages directly, even with opkg install:<br /><a href="http://www.wuala.com/fratzicu/Public/OpenWrt-Kamikaze-TEW-632-BRP">http://www.wuala.com/fratzicu/Public/Op … EW-632-BRP</a></p><br /><p>Good luck, guys and girls!</p>									</div>
