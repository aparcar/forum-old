					<p>I&#039;m trying to make it so that traffic from my HE ipv6 tunnel won&#039;t be routed onto my internal network. As far as I can tell, its firewall zone is not allowed to forward to my lan zone, and I even created a rule for all traffic from he:0.0.0.0/0 to lan:0.0.0.0/0:* to DROP the traffic. Yet I can still ping and connect to LAN systems from an external server. Here&#039;s my rules:</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/TLUpH8X.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/TLUpH8X.png"/></span></p><p>Pastebin of /etc/config/firewall <a href="http://pastebin.com/BK8GZYSC">here</a></p><p>Only custom rule is one to allow the tunnel itself to be connected (iptables -A INPUT -p 41 -i eth0 -j ACCEPT). It&#039;s running a somewhat outdated version of OpenWRT (10.03.1-RC6) but I wouldn&#039;t think that would prevent the firewall from blocking properly.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ugh, changing it to reject forwarding on HE worked, even though it clearly says that the blanket forwarding rule is for different networks within that zone.</p>									</div>

					<p>But isn&#039;t that linked to the Input/Output/Forward controls on luci? I&#039;m talking about the ones in the row for that zone/on the zone page. Seems like a misleading tooltip if so.</p>									</div>
