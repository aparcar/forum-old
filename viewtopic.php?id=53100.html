					<p>I have native IPv6 address from my ISP but doesn&#039;t have a prefix assignment. So in AA(12.09), I&nbsp; used 6relayd+odhcpd to enable IPv6 NDP Proxy to let my computers get global IPv6 address from my ISP. All things work fine. But 6relayd seems to have some bug that sometimes keep my router in a high load average(above 100). <br />Now final version of BB have came, and I know BB have native IPv6 stack and I upgraded my router today. I followed instructions from <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network6">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network6</a> to setup a IPv6 relay. <br />My computers now can have global IPv6 address from my ISP(prefix with 2001) BUT CANN&#039;T HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET.<br />I tried to figure it out but failed. In local machine, I saw the IPv6 gateway is router&#039;s address, not ISP gateway&#039;s. I tried ping6 but got &#039;No route to host&#039; message. I&#039;m a newbie with IPv6 and hope anyone could solve my problem.</p><p>Thanks. Forgive me for my poor English.</p>									</div>

					<p>Your router acts as router, not bridge, so the gateway pointing to the router is correct. You cannot access the internet as the routed prefix is incorrect, you should ask your ISP for help. You can also try to upgrade to 14.07 which is the newest stable release.</p>									</div>

					<p>Finally I figure this out. If you follow the example config on <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network6#router.advertisement.dhcpv6,">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network â€¦ nt.dhcpv6,</a> you just got a global address but failed to get access to the internet. You should add &#039;option interface wan&#039; below &#039;config dhcp wan6&#039; and you will get all things to work after restarting odhcpd service. <br />But here is another problem: you will lose internet connection after a while, so you need to restart this service intervally to make all clients get global ipv6 address and the internet, this maybe a bug or something else, but at least you have ipv6 connections. I will edit the wiki later.</p>									</div>
