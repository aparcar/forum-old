					<p>Hello,</p><p>first of all sorry if this is a completely stupid idea, but I&#039;m searching a solution for a maybe quite common problem, which could be easy and genious possible with openwrt but I don&#039;t see a beginners explanation...</p><p>I need to build up a conference / translation tool where on person speaks and multiple (maybe 10) are listening. There are solutions like the beonairapp .com but I think it could be much simpler.</p><p>With most mobiles nowadays are capable of WebRTC one could basically setup a openwrt-device opening a wifi network with a default landing page that links mobiles connecting to it to a WebRTC - connection. So people would not need an app, there are no 3rdparty servers involved and people would be happy *IHopeAtLeast*</p><p>Can somebody tell me if this is:<br />1) possible at all<br />2) easy enough for a non software engineer<br />3) or totally stupid because:...</p><p>Any help appreciated!</p><p>Best Regards,<br />leo</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>after some fiddling I got it working. Android phones work quite fine and after chosing the WLAN they play the stream in the &quot;new-wifi-wants-your-ok&quot; page. Apple on the other hand is totally broken and will not be supported by myself...<br />Whoever is interested, I documented it very oldschool on my asocial website: <br /><a href="http://leo.j-crew.de/index.php?slab=translator">leo.j-crew.de/index.php?slab=translator</a></p><p>And a big thankyou for all developers of openWRT!</p><p>Best Regards,<br />leo</p>									</div>
