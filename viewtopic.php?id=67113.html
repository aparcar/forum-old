					<p>1)<br />Cloning the &quot;packages&quot; that way is wrong. Packages is a &quot;feed&quot;, downloaded by the build system using the info at&nbsp; feeds.conf.default</p><p>The svn download servers for feeds have been deprecated. You need to edit feeds.conf.default to use git servers before updating the feeds. &quot;packages&quot; can be found from git.openwrt.org, while &quot;luci&quot; is both at Github and git.openwrt.org</p><p>feeds.conf.default should be something like:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>src-git packages https://git.openwrt.org/12.09/packages.git
src-git luci https://github.com/openwrt/luci.git;luci-0.11
src-git routing git://github.com/openwrt-routing/packages.git;for-12.09.x</code></pre></div><p>(you don&#039;t need xwrt feed)</p><p>2)<br />The attempt to pick the correct revision looks really strange to me. That creates a new branch, but GIT knows nothing about the old SVN revisions.</p><p>Easiest is probably to identify the date/time for svn 33298 and then use that as the tool to checkout the correct revisions with </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> git checkout `git rev-list -n 1 --before=&quot;yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm&quot; master`</code></pre></div><p>To be meticulous, you should fetch not only the main sources but also luci and packages from the same moment. I use this script to do &quot;time machine&quot; magic:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>+#!/bin/bash
+#
+# versionT  -  Update source code to revision T and then build
+#              T argument: date as yyyy-mm-dd or &quot;yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm&quot;
+#              first &quot;git pull --depth=500&quot; to deepen git history (shallow)
+#              use &quot;git checkout master&quot; for each feed to get back to HEAD
+
+git checkout `git rev-list -n 1 --before=&quot;$1&quot; master`
+(cd feeds/luci     ; git checkout `git rev-list -n 1 --before=&quot;$1&quot; master`)
+(cd feeds/packages ; git checkout `git rev-list -n 1 --before=&quot;$1&quot; master`)
+(cd feeds/routing  ; git checkout `git rev-list -n 1 --before=&quot;$1&quot; master`)
+echo &quot;...install feeds...&quot;
+./scripts/feeds install -a</code></pre></div><p>The script is designed to be run after first updating the build system and feeds normally. Then I use &quot;git pull --depth=500&quot; in main source dir and in each feed directory (feeds/luci, feeds/packages) to deepen git history (to get the history of old commits).</p><p>EDIT:<br />Due to the partially arbitrary timestamps in native GIT commits, the script does not work perfectly with the newest commits that have been made directly to GIT. The reason is that GIT date parsing stops after finding the first commit with a suitable date even if that is not the oldest target commit. The commits may have been rebased without correcting the dates, so even a linear GIT history does not have linear timestamps. The script works ok for the old commits made originally via SVN as those have strictly linear timestamps.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 12 Sep 2016, 18:39)</p>

					<p>You can find the date from svn...<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/33298/">https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/33298/</a></p><p>The date/time of that exact svn revision seems to be 2012-08-29T12:37:35+02:00 <br />Timezones can make getting the exactly same git commit a bit difficult, so if it does not need to be exactly that, you might just use 2012-08-30</p><p>And you can of course also browse git history (now that you know the date) and find out the git commit hash for that commit. Then you could checkout directly that commit. ...hmmm... Apparently 12.09 has been branched off in December 2012, so this is earlier. So you likely need to use the trunk/master for obtaining that revision.</p><p>Looking at trunk/master history d6de6b1e833ed4fdc8c5489900e4dc29fccac5d0 looks right:<br /><a href="http://git.openwrt.org/?p=openwrt.git;a=shortlog;pg=131">http://git.openwrt.org/?p=openwrt.git;a=shortlog;pg=131</a><br /><a href="http://git.openwrt.org/?p=openwrt.git;a=commit;h=d6de6b1e833ed4fdc8c5489900e4dc29fccac5d0">http://git.openwrt.org/?p=openwrt.git;a â€¦ 29fccac5d0</a></p><p>Going back to ancient history is not easy. And it was not that easy with svn either, if you wanted the exactly same old feed versions (instead of using old main source with up-to-date feeds, which can lead into nasty surprises).</p><p>You may also run into problems e.g. with toolchain. Some of the old compilers (used then) are not happy with current OS versions. E.g. some old gcc versions do not run with new Ubuntus.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 23 Aug 2016, 14:37)</p>

					<p>Like I said above, AA was branched from trunk later than 33298 (likely at 33625), so you need to use trunk to get 33298.

You are in &#039;detached HEAD&#039; state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b &lt;new-branch-name&gt;

You might also succeed with the luci and packages feeds from 12.09, but those were created later at branching.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 23 Aug 2016, 18:26)</p>
