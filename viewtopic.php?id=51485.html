					<p>Hi,<br />I just flashed my TL-WR841ND V9 with openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr841n-v9-squashfs-factory.bin, then installed luci,&nbsp; at the end of the installs there is 112kb left. I wish to install OpenVPN but that requires 138kb so I&#039;m short of space.<br />So my question is does anybody have luci and openvpn working?</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Talby</p>									</div>

					<p>A common problem, really. Both just won&#039;t fit into a 4 MB flash device, there&#039;s no &quot;trick&quot; to install them both so they will fit.</p><p>There&#039;s two solutions:<br />a) use extroot to extend your router&#039;s memory with an external device<br />b) build or compile a custom image that contains both LuCI and OpenVPN -- when built into an image, packages get compressed and will fit</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello talby23,</p><p>First of all, how did you try to install the OpenVPN package? With opkg or before flashing the image? Remember you have to &quot;embed&quot; the package with Image Builder in the firmware or compile from source with that package before flashing. If you haven&#039;t done it yet what I&#039;d do is try to install luci and openvpn packages with the image builder. I&#039;ts quite easy if you follow this page:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtain.firmware.generate">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtai â€¦ e.generate</a></p><p>I got OpenVPN installed on this router but not Luci.&nbsp; If even installing packages before flashing you&#039;re short of space I don&#039;t know what else you can do, except from removing other applications.</p>									</div>
