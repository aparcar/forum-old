					<p>This is similar to already asked questions, but the answer has yet to be given.</p><p>I fixed up the &quot;openwrt-x86-2.6-ext2.image&quot; so that I can boot it on my MSN Companion and IA1 - Don&#039;t start getting Ideas anyone who finds this - I have no plans for framebuffer or other features, just the basic hardware... so its not the next jailbait killer or midori ...</p><p>Anyway, I noticed that when I booted the system that root was mounted read/write</p><p>I have </p><p>rootfs on / rootfs (rw)<br />/dev/root on / type ext2 (rw)</p><p>now what I really want would be something like how (from what I&#039;ve read) that when a change is made it modifies another partition, and the original is left intact.</p><p>I think there is unionfs for this exact thing -but is that supported in OpenWrt (x86) ?</p><p>I just want this device to be able to power off at a moments notice, and not worry about having to fsck the main drive.&nbsp; - if the settings drive gets hosed -- oh well .. redo the setup..</p><p>-Prozacgod</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Prozacgod</strong> on 24 Jun 2007, 06:41)</p>

					<p>It seems that I can use the squashfs setup for this purpose, I finally answered my own question - I hadn&#039;t even looked at either squashfs or jffs2, I ran across it in documentation for other things.</p><p>Also seems that there aren&#039;t a lot of x86 packages compiled for OpenWrt - I&#039;ll probably be building a lot of x86 packages for a few of the minuscule x86 devices I have around.&nbsp; Perhaps I&#039;ll post the binaries for others to enjoy <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>-Prozacgod</p>									</div>
