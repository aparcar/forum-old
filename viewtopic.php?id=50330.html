					<p>I have a router with latest trunk installed. LAN is 192.168.1.x, WAN is on vlan 6 (with a public address) and an IPTV service comes trough vlan 2 on a static IP 10.250.x.y. Both are natted (masqueraded).</p><p>Internet works, multicast IPTV channels work thanks to igmpproxy, and the set-top boxes interface and menus work (bird4 gets RIPv2 routes). This is it:</p><p><a href="http://goo.gl/fAPU8t">http://goo.gl/fAPU8t</a></p><p>My problem is pay-per-view. I always get a black screen. I made a tcpdump and it seems that an RTSP sesi√≥n is negotiated correctly but then unicast video comes not from the IP used during negotiation, but from a different IP and port. iptables sees this as a new connection, it arrives to the external 10.250.x.y interface but it is not natted to the original lan ip that requested the video.</p><p>If I only had a single settop box I could simply redirect this traffic. I&#039;ve tried this and it works (on one STB). But, alas, I have three STBs. </p><p>The ISP&#039;s original router works perfectly and I&#039;ve only noticed a &quot;full cone NAT&quot; option enabled that I don&#039;t know how to implement in iptables.</p><p>I&#039;ve build the trunk and included every conntrack helper (including rtsp) and tried every iptables rule I could think of without success.</p><p>Maybe there exists some kind of proxy that could help but I googled and couldn&#039;t find anything.</p><p>Please help me. And thank you for this great software.</p>									</div>
