					<p>I have around 30 OpenWRT access points in our building (plenty of them are old Linksys). It&#039;s time to update our wireless network. Some of old APs will be replaced with TP Link Archos Ac1750. Problem is that maintain 30+ access points is quite quite time consuming (if you want to change passwords, you have to do this on each access point). Solution is to use wireless controller. And here is my question. Is there any? I found only OpenWISP, but the documentation is rather poor.<br />Maybe do you prefer any other way for maintaining large number of routers?<br />Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>firstly install <a href="https://github.com/openwisp/OpenWISP-Manager">https://github.com/openwisp/OpenWISP-Manager</a> it&#039;s controller software. <br />secondly chose your wifi ap platform based on ar73xx. there provided fw package for wifi ap <a href="https://github.com/openwisp/OpenWISP-Firmware">https://github.com/openwisp/OpenWISP-Firmware</a> . <br />thirdly you may install openvpn on your controller or on another server ff you want use tunnel for connection between ap and controller. if you do not want use openvpn tunnels you must change fw package scripts for connecting directly to controller. <br />also if you interested in more details I can translate some my documentation in English.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi I plan to find a way to manage 100s hotspot APs in multi-site campus. It appears openWISP a good fit based on some of information. I like to try it out. Since this is my first to install the solution bundled with so many packages, I am getting a bit puzzle where to start and how to get it go step by step without more documents. </p><p>Have you written some documents to share since this early post in your message? I am struggling on the pieces of the OWM and OWUMS while installing Ruby enterprise at initial setup such as Ruby enterprise due to openssl etc. The OS is Debian 8 (Jessie).</p>									</div>
