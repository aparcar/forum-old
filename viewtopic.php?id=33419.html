					<p>Hello all, i have many troubles to connect my Kinforce XR1 PC/SC usb smart reader to my router. I have a Netgear wndr3700v2 running OpenWrt &quot;Attitue Adjustement&quot; rev. 29330.</p><p>I would use this reader for my pay-tv card, so i installed OScam for my platform. But Oscam won&#039;t recognize reader. I put in config file to search &quot;device = 0&quot;, as in the oscam board was suggested, because (as read there) all of that kind of devices start from 0. But my dmesg output say that:</p><p>usb 2-1: new low speed USB device number 2 using ar71xx-ohci</p><p>and, also with &quot;device = 2&quot; setting, the reader is not recognized.</p><p>this is my lsusb output</p><p>Bus 002 Device 002: ID 096e:0005 Feitian Technologies, Inc. </p><p>so i guess that chipset is a Feitian, and the reader will like Feitian R200.</p><p>So my question is: should it works? I have to find some specific drivers? The libpcsc is to 1.5.5 version, it is possible to compile a new version 1.8.1? And what about ccid? <br />I need help to compile drivers from source, Thanks</p>									</div>
