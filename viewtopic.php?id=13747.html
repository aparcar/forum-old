					<p>I put a RP-SMA pigtail in a Netgear WGT-634U.&nbsp; On an AP that&#039;s about 300 feet away (but with suburban obstacles), iwconfig reports my link quality/noise margin as 10.&nbsp; That&#039;s with a 5 or 7 db antenna.&nbsp; Without the antenna, the margin is 6, and with 14db antenna, assuming I aimed it right, the margin is 12.</p><p>These just see too low.&nbsp; Is it more likely that I did a bad job stripping the pigtail wire and soldering, or that there are too many obstacles?</p>									</div>
