					<p>Hi</p><p>This does not relate to openwrt as it is but I used the cross-compile howto to understand how to make binaries for a package for my db120 board.</p><p>I compiled the source for tftp-hpa and copied the tftpd binary to my board. Now if i run ./tftpd , I just get a blank line and pressing anything i get back shell. Is there anyway I can run tftp server using just the binary?</p><p>NOTE that I am not using openwrt on the board. I am using the base OS.</p>									</div>

					<p>Consult the man page for this application to find out in which location(s) you have to place appropriate configuration files (if any). Running &#039;./tftpd -h&#039; may also help.</p>									</div>
