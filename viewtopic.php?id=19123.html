					<p>I have a LINUX server running in a office but I want to print(quickly) to another remote office.&nbsp; Three parallel printers print character based forms.&nbsp; Dot matrix will live forever.&nbsp; The shortest possible print delay is important as users are impatient.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was thinking that an OpenWRT device could help and be a router-firewall at the same time.</p><p>Possible transports:</p><p>1. Internet Printing Protocol and CUPS</p><p>2. OpenVPN </p><p>3. forget OpenWRT and go IPCOP with add-ons</p><p>Hardware for three parallel printers needs to be identified.&nbsp; Is there a router-firewall box that would support the printers?&nbsp; What would be a useful system design?</p>									</div>
