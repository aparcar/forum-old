					<p>This card for years had crashes in default r8169 driver. Only recently it was fixed.<br />Before that had to download and compile r8168 driver from realtek website.<br />For openwrt kmod compilation is more complex that ordinary linux.<br />So I&#039;d use the latest possible kernel. In openwrt it means using latest distro (not sure if CC is unaffacted) or even trunk (kernel is very new there). If you use trunk then you cant rely on network package repo because it will update many times and will invalidate optional kmods. Have to download repo with some web bulk download software and point opkg config to local location.<br />If you can find intel gigabit network card. Its stable.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bolvan</strong> on 24 Apr 2016, 09:38)</p>
