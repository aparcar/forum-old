					<p>Hi !</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I would like to build some extra optware packages currently unavailable for my board (buffalo wzr-hp-g300nh<br />running Backfire r20728). I downloaded svn bacfire sources, and built binaries with no problem.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Then I downloaded optware (svn trunk version) and tried to build packages for openwrt-atheros target, but<br />these packages appear as built for mips-openwrt (eg hello_2.7-1_mips-openwrt.ipk), whereas packages within<br />openwrt are built for the correct architecture (eg libc_0.9.30.1-43.31_ar71xx.ipk), with the same toolchain, of<br />course !!!</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;BTW, obviously it&#039;s &quot;just a packaging problem&quot; as far as the binaries seem to run correctly on the board !</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Please, could anyone help me to build optware packages for the correct architecture ?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanx</p><p>--<br />&nbsp; Manu</p>									</div>

					<p>Is this really the right way ? </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I thought that the basic idea was to include in OpenWrt the necessary packages for a Wireless Embedded Router and then<br />to allow the use of an extra packaging system (namely optware, which includes openwrt dedicated targets) for guys who<br />need/want &quot;exotic&quot; features ...</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I only need an help on the correct configuration of Optware use of openwrt toolchain. I guess I only forgot a parameter<br />or two.&nbsp; Obviously, the same variable (TARGET_ARCH) is used both to find the path to the build tools (and this part works<br />fine) and to build the ipk files (and that&#039;s where we would need TARGET_ARCH=ar71xx). Of course, there are some ugly<br />ways to patch this, but I would prefer to do this the right way, ...). A clean solution could allow all the optware packages<br />to &quot;ported&quot; , ...</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;No one has done this !?</p><p>--<br />&nbsp; Manu</p>									</div>

					<p>To answer to written_direcon, I want to use my box as a small mail server (I&nbsp; already did that<br />with a nlsu2 during several years after the &quot;retirement&quot; of my sun IPC).</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;So OK guys, I made the &quot;port&quot; (well kind of) the ugly way :</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;. I added a OPT_PKG_TARGET_ARCHITECTURE=ar71xx in my platform&#039;s toolchain definition (and added<br />a default value in the top level Makefile)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;. I patched all the make/*.mk so that the ipk are built for OPT_PKG_TARGET_ARCHITECTURE rather than<br />for TARGET_ARCH : </p><p>find . -name &quot;*.mk&quot; -print | xargs sed -i &#039;s/TARGET_ARCH/OPT_PKG_TARGET_ARCHTECTURE/g&#039;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;It seems that TARGET_ARCH is only (explicitly) used for this in these files.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;And here we go, ...</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I am sure there is a better way, maybe longer, ...</p><p>--<br />&nbsp; Manu</p>									</div>

					<p>Oups sorry !</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, my previous config runnnig on a nslu2 on top of an older openwrt version was based<br />on fetchmail/procmail/postfix/spamassassin/cyrus-imapd/... some of them are available in<br />openwrt, some other have disappear !</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;By the way, I really miss ebtables for multicast propagation (rather than a upnp proxy)</p>									</div>
