					<p>@rahul1023</p><p>Looking through some of the documentation about wds, it isn&#039;t going to work with Netgear. WDS is a non standard and each vender has a different way of implementing it. To maintain compatibility with WDS, you have to running the same hardware and software.. Meaning for it to work you would need two 1900acsV2&#039;s running the same version of LEDE.</p><p>Maybe someone else has been able to get different brands and software working? Or is there some other detail that perhaps I&#039;m missing about this WDS implementation?</p><p>*EDIT*</p><p>There may be a way for the ACS to be in AccessPoint mode, but yet configure the Linksys to connect to the ACS as a client.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davidc502</strong> on 4 Jun 2017, 19:41)</p>
