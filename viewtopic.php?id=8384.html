					<p>Hi everybody.</p><p>I&#039;m setting up a meshed wireless network for my thesis project, and I am having some problems getting AODV-UU to work correctly.</p><p>I&#039;m using WRT54GL routers, running OpenWRT R6, and aodv-uu. Identical setup on all routers. I can start aodv-uu, and the routing table is updated with the IP&#039;s of the wireless interfaces on neighbouring nodes. This is my setup:</p> <br /><p>&nbsp; Wired&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Router&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wireless&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Router&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wired</p><p>192.168.2.1 - [R2] - 10.0.0.2 ------- 10.0.0.3 - [R3] - 192.168.3.1</p><p>After starting aodv, R2 knows that 10.0.0.3 is directly connected, but R2 does not know that it can reach 192.168.3.1/24 through 10.0.0.3. R3 does not tell R2 which networks it has direct access to. How can I get the routers to share this information?&nbsp; I have cleared all rules from iptables, set policy ACCEPT on all chains, and activated forwarding, which should be all that is needed, but nothing happens. I have even tried explicitly forwarding all traffic between the wired and wireless interface, that did not help either.</p><p>I would be thankful for any help.</p><br /><p>My iptables:</p><p>root@Two:~# iptables -L<br />Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)<br />target&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;prot opt source&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;destination</p><p>Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)<br />target&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;prot opt source&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;destination</p><p>Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)<br />target&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;prot opt source&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;destination<br />root@Two:~# iptables -t nat -L<br />Chain PREROUTING (policy ACCEPT)<br />target&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;prot opt source&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;destination</p><p>Chain POSTROUTING (policy ACCEPT)<br />target&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;prot opt source&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;destination</p><p>Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)<br />target&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;prot opt source&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;destination</p><br /><p>root@Two:~# cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward<br />1</p>									</div>

					<p>joek0100, have you gotten this working yet? We are running the latest version of AODV-UU (0.9.5) in a class I&#039;m in and running into the same issues. If you got this working I&#039;d love to talk with you.</p>									</div>

					<p>I just wanted to post an update. In a class that I&#039;m in we were able to successfully ping each end node if they were neighbors. As soon as we moved those two nodes too far apart to see each other and placed a third node in between the center node could see the others but was not passing route information.</p><p>Working: A &lt;--&gt; B<br />Not Working: A &lt;--&gt; C &lt;--&gt; B</p><p>That was all done using the example command they give in the readme file of &quot;aodvd -l -r 3&quot;. I got a reply back from someone suggesting trying to run the &quot;-o&quot; switch. When we did that in class last night it worked. The command we used on all three systems was &quot;aodvd -l -r 3 -o&quot;.</p><p>joek0100, I never heard back from you so I don&#039;t know if you&#039;re still trying to get this to work but try the &quot;-o&quot; switch.</p><p>Good luck everyone,</p><p>Ben</p>									</div>
