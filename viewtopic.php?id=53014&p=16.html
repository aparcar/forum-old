					<p>Thanks, liladude, using a serial programmer connection direct to the board, the 57600 was the key as I can now see U-Boot with options. That&#039;s a good start. Now I just have to figure out what all those options mean. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>The options shown are...<br />Please choose the operation:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;1: Load system code to SDRAM via TFTP.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;2: Load system code then write to Flash via TFTP.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;3: Boot system code via Flash (default).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;4: Entr boot command line interface.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;7: Load Boot Loader code then write to Flash via Serial.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;9: Load Boot Loader code then write to Flash via TFTP.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>I guess I can give option 1 a try. I&#039;d like to install the HooToo stock firmware and start again.</p><p>After the options I am getting the default menu option running, #3<br />3: System Boot system code via Flash.<br />## Booting image at bc050000 ...<br />raspi_read: from :50000 len:40<br />.Bad Magic Number,23212F62</p><p>Not sure what to do about that Magic Number.</p><p>I have downloaded the HooToo tar.gz in the revised link on page 1 or 2 of this thread. I used 7zip to un-gz and un-tar and found the Kernel folder but not sure what to do with all that stuff. </p><p>The main problem I am having is that very helpful people here (you included) assume a certain level of prior knowledge with linux et al. I am not a newbie to computers or windows programming but totally lost with most of the linux-type stuff.</p><p>I will look back through your posts as I recall reading about renaming the firmware to Kernel.something and not including uboot.bin or something in the upload folder.</p><p>Thanks anyway. It was good to see real text on the screen. Not sure how I missed 57600 as I tried a bunch.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>HooTooBeatMe</strong> on 12 Oct 2015, 19:56)</p>

					<p>Ahhh, RangerZ, thanks, it does look like they are the files I need. BUT before putting you to any more trouble sending them. Let me research the process as wingspinner alludes to this person, &quot;well versed embedded hardware/software hacker&quot; and I am certainly not that person yet. LOL</p><p>Sooo, let me see if I can find some detailed instructions that will show me the way. I have the programmer and cables so that part is easy. I can also access and manipulate the UBoot console, but I do NOT know what I am doing and that is always dangerous. But, if I can find instructions, I would be most grateful for a copy of those files. </p><p>I realize these are only 15-bucks items, but if I can get this second one going I will then have two working that I can give to needy local old farts whose routers may have failed them. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

Set your Ethernet with static address 10.10.10.254.<br />inside the main folder of your tftp server put<br />- for the open wrt the firmware.bin file from the zip you get front the &#039;factory&#039; bin<br />- for the Hootoo firmware the combination of partial bins suggested by mmmdonuts <br />rename it kernel (remove the .bin)</p><p>Connect your pc and router through Ethernet cable.<br />From the serial console try 1 or 2, it should look for a file called kernel in server on your tftp<br />After that it will look for another file you don&#039;t have, dismiss it and reboot the router (unplug power, plug it again).<br />After that you should see it coming back to life as openwrt or Hootoo <br />If n.1 option in serial console is not working, with everything setted as above and a paperclip ( or your finger if you have the boatr out of its housing) press the reset button, unplug power, keep reset pushed and plug power on. You&#039;ll see the bootloader booting, starting a countdown up to ten, then looking for the tftp file. When the tftp is issued you can release the reset button.<br />My unit was not willing to let me connect to the Hootoo wifi, so I opted for openwrt.<br />tftp over Ethernet is fast, I would suggest you to get the latest and bigger firmware bin from the git and then sysupgrade to CC stable.<br />Let me know if it works for you.<br />lila</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>liladude</strong> on 13 Oct 2015, 15:43)</p>
