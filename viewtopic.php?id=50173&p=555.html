					<p>Hi, recently I tired the new r2443 LEDE on my WRT1200AC. And when I wanted to roll back to OpenWrt CC.01, it read in the luci interface as: &quot;The uploaded image file does not contain a supported format. Make sure that you choose the generic image format for your platform.&quot; I tired OEM fw, but the situation is similar. There are some other people around have the same problem as mine.</p><p>Could somebody help? thx a lot!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>muronghan</strong> on 8 Dec 2016, 15:45)</p>

When I bought it, I looked for HDCP 2.2 specifications, because I knew it was coming with 4K televisions, and I&#039;m happy it is there, otherwise I would have had to have bought another receiver for my 4k TV . Long story short Tri-Band is coming quickly, and those that already have it in place, don&#039;t have to replace what they have today to get the best speeds.</p><p>my 2¢</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davidc502</strong> on 13 Dec 2016, 02:43)</p>

					<p>swrt-2016-12-13<br />---------------</p><p>Since last time 4 out of 5 pull requests got merged and 5 new ones added. So the first 15 patches are pending OpenWrt this time. The eth0 vs eth1 patch is part of the series but as I still use DSA it doesn&#039;t matter. The RFC is out there, no need to switch back and forth for just that. Well, I thought maybe the extra week gives me some time to look into making the two coexist but was occupied otherwise.</p><p>As mentioned earlier there is a new usb led trigger &quot;usbport&quot;. The trigger isn&#039;t a 1:1 replacement for the out of tree usbdev trigger. It lacks activity indication but instead allows the tiny usb3 led to glow in addition if it&#039;s a super speed (usb3) device. Let me know if it doesn&#039;t work for someone. With that only out of tree led trigger left is netdev, which sort of could be replaced by the netfilter one, thou upstreaming a netdev trigger might be desirable.</p><p>Haven&#039;t seen any activity upstream wrt xtables-addons and 4.9 so I threw in a patch and removed it from the list of broken packages. With that there are no real issues I&#039;m aware of with 4.9 so I&#039;m making it the profile default. 4.8 is still maintained for those who want it.</p><p>There also was an mwlwifi bump but the big Rango fix is still pending. Nothing exciting to report on that front.</p><br /><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>* linux-4.8: bump to 4.8.14<br />* linux-4.9: bump to 4.9<br />* linux-next: bump to next-20161212<br />* linux-4.1, linux-4.4: backport ethernet DT node reordering commit and fixup base-files<br />* linux-4.8: drop spidev-test musl fixup, fixed upstream<br />* linux-4.9: backport usbport ledtrig fix from linux-next<br />* linux-4.9: make profile default<br />* mwlwifi-nocompat: 10.3.2.0-20161124<br />* xtables-addons: add fix for 4.9 and remove broken status.</p><p>swrt-2016-12-13.tar.xz: <a href="https://gpldr.in/v/ccEzHjWLNG/cbWX3LykiYhKA2mr">https://gpldr.in/v/ccEzHjWLNG/cbWX3LykiYhKA2mr</a><br />sha256sum: 1fd593705da2af408754928a8a95d784a732c9019aece0d3b39788b278c3644e</p></blockquote></div>									</div>

					<p>This thought just occurred to me:&nbsp; one of the things the router mfgs have done poorly is communicate the true benefits of the hardware they&#039;re selling.&nbsp; Since the 5g performance has been stabilised I&#039;ve moved both remote stations to it, and with the WRT1900AC/S talking to each other I can maintain &gt;30GB/s file transfers from both remote stations at the same time.</p><p>I&#039;m guessing the WRT3200 with its &quot;tri-stream&quot; technology may be able to handle high bandwidth between three remote connections?</p><p>Yes, having the high cpu speed and lots of RAM helps out with non-standard home router applications -- but the main reason to use one of these routers is the wireless access and that&#039;s where these actually shine.&nbsp; Just a thought.</p>									</div>
