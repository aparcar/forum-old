					<p>Hey yall,</p><p>I&#039;m currently trying to move some scripts I&#039;ve modified/added to github from my router.&nbsp; I keep getting this error:</p><p>ssh: Connection to git@github.com:22 exited: No auth methods could be used.</p><p>I&#039;ve been trying a solution provided in an older thread with no luck.</p><p>I assume my issue is between public and private keys however the solution provided in the other thread hasnt gotten me to a working state.&nbsp; Moreover, I have git installed on the router, the repository is setup, as is the remote origin and the above error is the result of &#039;git push -u origin master&#039;</p><p>If any one can help with this issue it would be appreciated,<br />thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve struggled with the same a while back and I believe the openssh server in OpenWrt is rather limited in the auth methods it supports and github actually requires key algorithms which OpenWrt&#039;s openssh doesn&#039;t support.<br />Please do post back if you&#039;re able to overcome this problem.</p>									</div>

					<p>I, think, I made the switch to openssh however I&#039;m still getting an error, specifically</p><p>dbclient: exited: string too long</p><p>I&#039;m not sure if thats referring to the length of the key or not, but it is progress nonetheless.&nbsp; I also think I still need ssh-agent / ssh-add but I&#039;m assuming I either dont know what packets/modules I&#039;m missing or they arent compatible with openwrt. I believe I need access to those functions otherwise I dont know how to correct the keys in a way to let me access github. Let me know if yall have any advice, also if I do find a solution I&#039;ll be sure to post it here.</p><p>Thanks for the help</p>									</div>
