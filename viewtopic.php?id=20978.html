					<p>Hello,</p><p>i have a big problem with my RB433. I have spent two days looking for a solution and i didn&#039;t find anything so far. I have installed openwrt on a Routerboard RB433, it is quite stable until I start transmiting via my WiFi card (CM9, Atheros AR...?). After that RB433 reboots itself. I have the same problem with both madwifi and ath5k so i think it is not a driver issue. I have found a similar problem in another thread (<a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=90340">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=90340</a>), but there is no solution. I have tried three CM9 and the last one is completly new. I don&#039;t know what to try now. Could you assist and suggest something that would help me resolving this issue?</p><p>Adam</p>									</div>

					<p>Can u try Kamikaze 7.09 with MadWifi ?</p><p>I was trying many different 8.09 versions, none of them was working good.<br />While using 7.09, I had no problems, but am unable to build Quagga-unstable (0.99.11) so can&#039;t test it in real enviroment on my network.<br />If u can provide me with some help on how to build the package for 7.09 or give me the binary of the package I could try to test it on 433AH.<br />But, I must say, Mikrotik RouterOS 4.0 RC is working very well now on that board.</p>									</div>

We use Debian (2.6.18.) with MadWifi. Also we use Ralink cards for 2.4GHz in 802.11g and 802.11n mode.</p><p>The thing is, OpenWRT and the RB433AH was looking very very promising while testing it with 1 miniPCI card on Kamikaze 7.09. It was running for more than 2 months very stable on a link 450m long with an throughput of 60-65Mbps.<br />After that I upgraded to 8.09 and put it in place of our old router with 3 wireless links. I tested many different versions of 8.09. On some of them, I could only get 1 link working, on others I got low throughput and on some I got random reboots. <br />After a few months of work with no results, I put the Mikrotik RouterOS back on the board, upgraded to 4.0 RC and am quite pleased how it is working. </p><p>Latest version I tried was a trunk 1 month ago.</p><p>I also have a IXP4xx board from SparkLAN with 2 miniPCI slots and the same problems are happening there, so I can rule out a hardware or architecture issue.</p><p>Now, I had to put the 433AH in production due to lack of hardware, but still have the IXP4xx board to play with OpenWRT. Hope it works because the SparkLAN IXP4xx board is a real best-buy in 2-miniPCI boards segment.</p><p>Regards</p>									</div>
