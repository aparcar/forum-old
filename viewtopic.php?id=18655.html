					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am trying to get open wrt to work on a PC-Engines WRAP Board. I followed the Howto and could compile. Now Im trying to get an atheros card to work which I pluged into the miniPCI port of the WRAP Board.<br />The first problem is that if i compile the ath5k driver into the kernel than it works and i can find the wlan interface in iwconfig. If I try to use the driver as a module by selecting &lt;M&gt; in menuconfig I can not load the driver. It simply says &quot;insmod: Loading module failed: No such file or directory&quot;. I think that in the .image file whiche I put to the CF-Card doesn&#039;t contain the module. Now I want to know where I can find these modules und where to put them to get these modules to run.</p><p>The second thing is that I actually want madwifi driver to work. I selected &lt;M&gt; at madwifi in menuconfig. No I can not load this driver because I can not be found. I dont know why. </p><p>Tanks for help!</p>									</div>

					<p>When you set it to &quot;&lt;M&gt;&quot; in menuconfig that means the build system will make a .ipkg, which you need to install with &quot;opkg install $pkgname&quot; (or use LuCI to do it).</p><p>If you set it to &lt;*&gt;, then the module will be installed before the CF image is made, so you don&#039;t need to do anything at runtime (but the image will be bigger).</p><p> -jra</p>									</div>
