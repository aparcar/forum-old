					<p>Hello everyone!</p><p>I have this european model of Buffalo WZR-900DHP and I&#039;m wondering is this even supported by OpenWrt. I tried to flash a couple of images found from <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/brcm47xx/mips74k/.">https://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_b … /mips74k/.</a></p><p>However all my efforst to install OpenWrt resulted in a bricked router. After few hours of tweaking and googling I was able to revert back to dd-wrt using the CFE web-gui. Despite of all that trouble I would still like to install OpenWrt - mostly because I want to implement my own QOS and stuff..</p><p>Did I just try to flash a wrong file or is it impossible to install it on this thing?</p>									</div>

					<p>The snapshot provided seems otherwise great, but the nl80211 driver initialization fails, disabling both WLAN interfaces.</p><p>The symptoms look like the ones described in earlier bug descriptions:<br />* <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/13688">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/13688</a><br />* <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/9669">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/9669</a></p><p>It looks like the firmware has difficulties reading the MAC address for the wireless interfaces.</p><p>Meanwhile, dd-wrt&#039;s beta firmware linked below gets both the 2.4 and 5 GHz radios up, but the transmission power is ultra weak.

					<p>Despite numerous attempts, I&#039;ve been unable to restore Buffalo&#039;s original firmware images on this device.</p><p>It seems like the WZR-900DHP-EU doesn&#039;t accept TFTP uploads even though boot_wait has been enabled in the NVRAM. I&#039;ve tried the arp tricks and the magic IP 192.168.11.1, but at no point during boot does the device answer to ARP or ICMP requests with this IP. Neither does it open the TFTP ports for receiving the upload.</p><p>Instead, the device tries to TFTP <strong>download</strong> the file linux.trx-recovery from 192.168.1.2 upon boot. While the device is fetching linux.trx-recovery, a CFE web gui is enabled. By throttling the TFTP server, I&#039;ve tried to use the CFE gui to upload Buffalo&#039;s firmware images, but the CFE claims that the images are invalid and refuses to flash them.</p><p>I&#039;ve also tried converting Buffalo&#039;s firmware images into .trx files with dd bs=32 skip=1, but no go. According to the following post, it seems that Buffalo&#039;s firmware images are encrypted and indeed, the files seem to begin with the characters &#039;bgn&#039;.</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=34212">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=34212</a></p><p>Thus, the firmware images are not accepted by mtd or dd-wrt&#039;s web GUI. With mtd the error is &quot;bad trx header&quot;, perhaps unsurprisingly. dd-wrt just reboots back into the previous firmware, ignoring the update.</p><p>For some Buffalo devices, there exists a modified firmware image that is acceptable by the dd-wrt web gui (and possibly mtd). After flashing the modified image, one can the follow up by flashing one of the Buffalo encrypted images. However, I&#039;ve been unable to figure out how to hack such an image for the WZR-900DHP. Any pointers?</p>									</div>
