					<p>So I did see this option this is the same as flashing it completely is it? </p><p>What is the difference between the bin files that are created, sysupgrade, factory etc? </p><p>The reason I am trying to do this is because I have created a custom package that has all my openwrt customisation&#039;s and ever time I work on it I want ensure that it works straight out of the box from initial boot.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Zorxd, </p><p>Are you in a position to explain the actual difference between the files, I understand their uses but not why they would differ in the actual files. </p><p>As discussed initially I am looking for a way to essentially completely reflash my unit, with the same version but fresh configs and defaults. Does sysupgrade do this or given its an upgrade will it be leaving some things behind. </p><p>Just to be sure you understand what I am talking about. I wish to completely erase and load a new firmware onto the unit as if I was flashing the manufactures firmware. </p><p>Cheers for anyhelp</p>									</div>
