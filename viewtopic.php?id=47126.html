					<p>I&#039;ve currently got a Netgear WNDR3700 running OpenWRT.&nbsp; Recently my ISP bumped me from 100Mbit to 1000Mbit service.&nbsp; I&#039;ve found that the little netgear, while great for everything else, just can&#039;t process that much data from WAN to LAN.&nbsp; I top out around 200-300Mbit, which looks to be close to other tests I&#039;ve seen on the web.</p><p><a href="http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/lanwan/router-charts/">http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/lanwan/router-charts/</a></p><p>The r7000 that&#039;s at the top of that list doesn&#039;t look to support OpenWRT.</p><p>Can someone recommend a router (that has wireless builtin as well), preferrably sub 300$ that can process this much data through the firewall?&nbsp; I think I&#039;d be happy with anything over 850Mbit at this time.&nbsp; I tried using a mini computer (fit-PC2i) and was only able to get about 450Mbit throughput.&nbsp; When connected directly to the ISP with no router, I can get over 900Mbit easy.&nbsp; I&#039;d prefer not to have to build a separate machine just to be my firewall, but I&#039;m not sure what my other options are at this point, that allows the level of configurability I need that OpenWRT supports.</p>									</div>

					<p>There&#039;s no such router running OpenWrt. Some routers with a hardware NAT in the switch chip can reach almost gigabit speeds, but HW NAT is not supported (and won&#039;t be in the near future) in OpenWrt. Something with a dual-core Atom would probably do it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Asus RT-N56U with custom firmware (non-wrt unfortunately) and hwnat enabled can handle up to ~1200mbit throughput (up+down) with DHCP/PPPoE on the WAN side. It is one of the few routers with 2 separate RGMII interfaces on the SoC as most of the devices use single interface and split traffic via VLANs.</p>									</div>
