					<p>I think you can set it up to just snoop for what your are looking for, rather than capturing everything; lots of different parameters that you can set, i.e. packet size.</p>									</div>

					<p>To intercept every packet on the line, you need to either pass through the PC (two ethernet cards bridged) or use an old-fashioned hub instead of a switch.&nbsp; A switch does hardware MAC based filtering.&nbsp; A hub simply repeats everything that is received on one port out to all the other ports.</p>									</div>
