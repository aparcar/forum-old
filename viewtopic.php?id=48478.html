					<p>I installed r35318 (Barrier Breaker) in my RT-N16 and it runs smoothly. However, when I tried to use the package manager in LuCI to install some packages (pptpd), the system replied the packages were not compatible with the core and could not be installed. Does that mean I must compile the packages myself before I can use them? I am a newbie.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>milanolau</strong> on 17 Jan 2014, 15:01)</p>

					<p>almost so, especially if you try to install kmods, kernel modules. They have a checksum that requires to install kmods built at the same time as the main kernel.</p><p>If you use a snapshot firmware, you can install all modules from the same snapshot right after the firmware install. But the next day&#039;s snapshop modules will again be incompatible.</p><p>If you compile the mainfirmware by yourself, included the needed kmods into it.</p>									</div>

					<p>r35318 is quite old, you should have r39xxx now. If you don&#039;t want to compile, you may want to do sysupgrade image.bin first and then you can install what you need.</p>									</div>

					<p>I am a newbie, so the problem is I don&#039;t know how to compile anything.<br />My RT-N16 cannot run on Attitude Adjustment; can I still use sysupgrade? Barrier Breaker is the only kernel my router can run.<br />Thanks for your reply anyway.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>milanolau</strong> on 17 Jan 2014, 15:16)</p>

					<p>Sysupgrade is normal way how you can upgrade most openwrt devices. I&#039;m not sure you can do sysupgrade on your router, maybe you need to do the full upgrade and configure everything again.</p><p>This is what I&#039;d do:<br />1. download <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/brcm47xx/openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … uashfs.trx</a><br />2 follow <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/asus/rt-n16#oem.installation.using.the.tftp.method">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/asus/rt-n16 … ftp.method</a></p><p>If you want to try sysupgrade, it works like this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cd /tmp
wget http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/brcm47xx/openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx
sysupgrade openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx</code></pre></div><p>If you will brick the router, use the tftp method.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 17 Jan 2014, 15:26)</p>

					<p>Hi! I installed on the Asus rt-n16 firmware <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/brcm47xx/openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … uashfs.trx</a><br />The problem is that the router was the trim speed both on a local network, and wi-fi. Coming WAN channel router 150-200 Mb/s. And the speed of the router on the LAN the 50-60 Mb/s,&nbsp; on wi-fi 1.5-3 Mb/sec. On the old firmware rate was much higher. Someone faced with this problem??</p>									</div>
