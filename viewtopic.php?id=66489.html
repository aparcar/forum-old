					<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>currently, I am working on OpenWrt and doing a modification on the open source firmware(openfwwf)<br />for the b43 on brcm47xx platform linksyswrt54gl. <br />My question:<br />How to read the shared memory using c code<br />or if it possible to save the data I want to access in a different way I have seen an implementation to access the General Purpose Register by using a commandline.But I couldnt figure out how that work is done.<br />I am sure that I will find the solution here.<br />thank you in advance</p>									</div>

					<p>Still not able to solve the problem:<br />but what I can tell you that reading a share memory need to have a permission to the debugfs which suppose to be install with b43 driver.Unfortinatly,&nbsp; the folder is not include or remove from the system during the build to save the memory.<br />I asked the question here <br /><a href="http://superuser.com/questions/1106909/how-to-install-b43-on-brcm-47xx">http://superuser.com/questions/1106909/ â€¦ -brcm-47xx</a><br />I think there are more information will be helpful.</p><p>I am really stack in my master thesis at this point if we can work in this issue together. it will be great</p>									</div>
