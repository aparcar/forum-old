					<p>After posting this guide a week later the creator of BFGMiner update the official openwrt readme to include the missing commands for installing the kernel drivers.&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>He also states in the readme you can submit an issue to possibly get a package created for currently unsupported hardware.<br />I wonder if I can get him to create a package including the libmicrohttpd so its easier to use openwrt with ASIC blades.&nbsp; Will submit a ticket today and find out.</p><p>*update* its coming with 3.2.2<br /><a href="https://github.com/luke-jr/bfgminer/issues/292">https://github.com/luke-jr/bfgminer/issues/292</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>StaticV</strong> on 27 Sep 2013, 19:04)</p>
