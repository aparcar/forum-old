					<p>Hello everyone.</p><p>I have recently obtained <a href="http://www.tp-link.com/products/product_spe.asp?id=44">this router</a>.</p><p>I checked it and it seems to be running Broadcom chipset BCM96345 with Busybox 1.0.</p><p>Here is the info in case anyone is interested:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Board ID:      96338L-2M-8M
Software Version:     3.02L.09.A2pB019b8.d16m
Bootloader (CFE) Version:     1.0.37-0.8

system type             : 96338L-2M-8M

Dec 12 17:39:45 192.168.1.1  BCM96345  started: BusyBox v1.00 (2006.06.26-09:01+0000)</code></pre></div><p>What I wonder now is whether I could &quot;roll my own&quot; firmware for this thing?</p><p>My main goal would be to have just ADSL G.dmt, NAT/port triggering, and eventually time of day restrictions so as to maximize amount of resources to be able to withstand high number (like 300-400) TCP/IP connections while still being responsive.</p><p>Router is really cheap, I paid 35€ for it. It is quite usable the way it is now, but I would like to be able to use more than 250 TCP/IP connections with it.</p><p>Does anyone have any usefull ideas, comments? Perhaps someone knows if this chipset is or will be supported by OpenWRT? Thank you in advance.<br />Regards,<br />Igor</p>									</div>

					<p>Welcome levicki!</p><p>Please don&#039;t be discouraged if you don&#039;t get a reply within a day around here.&nbsp; It&#039;s not that active of a weboard unfortunetly.</p><p>There appears to be Kernel 2.6.x support for Broadcom 963xx in Kamikaze, so go ahead and check out the latest SVN.&nbsp; Since you&#039;ll be needing ADSL, don&#039;t forget the br2684ctl and PPPoE or PPPoA packages if required.<br />I don&#039;t see an option for AnnexA or B in the Kamikaze menu, not sure if that&#039;s a problem or handled by CFE???</p><p>I personally don&#039;t have any routers using this chipset so I can&#039;t say if it will work or not (my routers are all AR7 and 947xx).</p><p>Cheers,<br />KillaB</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the reply.</p><p>I thought at first that maybe I posted a bit offtopic because this router doesn&#039;t have wireless but still it is the same chipset and it should work.</p><p>However, I wouldn&#039;t like to brick the router so I was hoping that someone more experienced (say one of the developers) could get a hold of one and test it.</p><p>Am I being to unrealistic in my expectations?</p>									</div>

					<p>If we could just add SD card to cheap ADSL routers like TD-8840 and make bootloader to boot from SD card we will get miniPC for few bucks.</p><p>So we need to:</p><p>1) Find out where to connect SD card pins to motherboard<br />2) Ask OpenWrt gurus to make tiny mini bootloader which will boot openwrt from SD card</p><p>The idea occurs to me when I red <a href="http://drgenetic.wordpress.com/2008/07/15/wifi-como-instalar-una-tarjeta-sd-en-wrt54g-configuracion-en-dd-wrt-y-openwrt-kamikaze/">http://drgenetic.wordpress.com/2008/07/ … -kamikaze/</a></p><p>Then I opened TD-8840B case, but I just can not find where to connect DO, CLK, DI and CS. Chip inside is BCM6338KFBG, so AFAIK we just need to find those pins on chip?</p>									</div>
