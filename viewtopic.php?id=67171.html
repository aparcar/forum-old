					<p>So, I&#039;ve been trying to detect where in my house I am by reading my RSSIs signals, but there are two problems: I need my phone with me all the time and it&#039;s not that accurate.</p><p>I&#039;ve been reading a lot about people reading Wi-Fi signals and making possible to detect if someone walks in the room, or room presence by the distortion people create on the Wi-Fi signals. Needs to be trained, obviously.</p><p>How is this done? Is it possible with an OpenWRT router? Or do I need more sophisticated hardware?</p><p>Here is an article of a recent work of this: <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/wifi-signals-can-id-individuals-by-body-shape">http://motherboard.vice.com/read/wifi-s â€¦ body-shape</a></p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s not a serious source, see the tags of that article and the rest of &quot;articles&quot; of that web. If you have read a lot about that issue, please share a better url.</p><p>I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s possible, but in that case, you will need a lot of routers around house to detect that. It&#039;s much more easy use webcams and Computer Vision software like OpenCV.</p>									</div>
