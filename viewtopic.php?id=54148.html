					<p>Hi, I&#039;m the author of that package feed. Notice I said &#039;author&#039; not &#039;maintainer&#039; because I (unfortunately) don&#039;t have the time to maintain it ;-P</p><p>Please do not confuse that feed with (official) OpenWrt packages.</p><p>[...]</p><p>Most folks don&#039;t care much about CUPS on a router because it is very hard to make &quot;normal&quot; use of it. Routers normally don&#039;t have enough RAM/CPU, and even (most) high-end routers lack the storage space to the (full) Linux printing stack.</p><p>CUPS is an important piece of this printing stack but it is not the whole thing.</p><p>So when I made that comment, what I meant is: if I had a little time to improve that package feed, I would spend it on packages (of the printing stack) where I see a lot more need for improvements than at CUPS, namely ghostscript (a total PITA to cross-compile) and cups-printing-filters from the LinuxFoundation.</p><p>[...]</p><p>PS 1: If you want to understand the Linux printing stack, I strongly suggest you to read the Linux from Scratch documentation on it. <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable/pst/printing.html">http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/vi … nting.html</a></p><p>Notice that to actually make a system that prints like a Linux laptop and workstation do, you&#039;ll have to add a lot of the recommended packages as well.</p><p>PS 2: &quot;Axet&quot; has recently fixed a number of issues in that feed of mine, <a href="https://github.com/axet/openwrt-printing-packages">https://github.com/axet/openwrt-printing-packages</a></p><p>PS 3: the Linux foundation has loads of good pages on its OpenPrinting project. Take a read at <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/openprinting/pdf_as_standard_print_job_format">http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collabor … job_format</a> it explains a lot as well.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>FranciscoBorges</strong> on 9 Jan 2015, 22:36)</p>
