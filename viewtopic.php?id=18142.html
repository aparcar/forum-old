					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have put openwrt/xwrt on about 6 wrt65g routers over the years for friends, family, and customers.</p><p>One of my customers recently ordered FiOS from the local telco and the technician installed a Westell 9100 EM router. It has a USB port on it that I would very much like to use as a print server or a connection for external storage. However, this manufacturer (not to mention model) is not on the Table of Hardware page.</p><p>I would like to know if anyone can comment of whether this *should* work with openwrt and if so, is there anything special to watch out for?</p><p>Here is the info page from Westell (and they *do* have an open source section)<br /><a href="http://www.westell.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=952&amp;arcsection=support">http://www.westell.com/index.php?option â€¦ on=support</a></p><p>Thanks!<br />Jeromey</p>									</div>
