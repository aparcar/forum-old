					<p>I have no idea why is it like this, but it is. In 8.09.2 and 10.03.1-rcX when wifi is on, the wrong LED blinks. Instead of the wifi one, the status led blinks like crazy.</p><p>I am pretty sure it looks exactly the same on all DIR-300&#039;s<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>GPIO 7 -- status led
GPIO 2 -- wifi led</code></pre></div><p>I was quite intrigued why is it like this, but haven&#039;t found out - must be a typo in source code or something?<br />Anyway, I am quite pleased to say that I found the way to fix it and make it use the proper LED. It&#039;s a bit trickier than saving one value to a config file. Here&#039;s what to do:</p><p>1. Add <em>softled=0</em> to your wireless config. This disables the use of our status LED (if set to 1, <em>Enables software based LED control in the driver </em> --&nbsp; source: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless)">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless)</a> <span style="color: grey">--this point is important if you are using mmc-over-gpio because it prevents the wrong LED from lighting up at all on bootup - therefore you can be sure your memory card is safe. Without this, after doing just the second step, the driver automatically lights up the status led in early boot and _then_ switches to the proper one - we don&#039;t want this, better safe than sorry--</span><br />This can be done by entering:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>uci set wireless.wifi0.softled=0
uci commit wireless</code></pre></div><p>2. The next step actually changes the used LED (GPIO) and enables what we just disabled in previous step (let there be light again!).<br />Add the following two lines to your <em>/etc/sysctl.conf</em> file<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dev.wifi0.ledpin=2
dev.wifi0.softled=1</code></pre></div><p>After rebooting, the status led won&#039;t light up at all. The wifi led will light up a little later than the status led lit up usually, but that is a minor detail and will function normally.</p><p>A little more info:<br />You can check how it works without rebooting your router. Just enter:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>sysctl -w dev.wifi0.ledpin=2
sysctl -w dev.wifi0.softled=1
gpioctl dirout 2</code></pre></div><p>The last line isn&#039;t really necessary but it speeds up the process (for some reason GPIO2 is set to dirin by default, it also somehow automatically changes after bootup)</p><p>Different softled settings:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dev.wifi0.softled=0    # softled and LED is always off
dev.wifi0.softled=1    # This is the default. LED blinks when device athX is &quot;up&quot; and transmitting or receiving data. LED is off when device athX is &quot;down&quot; or madwifi module is unloaded.
dev.wifi0.softled=2    # LED keeps staying ON (no blinking at all!) when device athX is in status &quot;up&quot;, and LED is off when device athX is &quot;down&quot;.</code></pre></div><p>Hope this helped, cheers <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>EDIT: Since some people asked &quot;What about the status LED if I&#039;m not using mmc-over-gpio? Is there a way to make it shine again&quot;?<br />The answer is sure;</p><p>You can also control that LED as you wish, e.g. let it light up when the router can ping some address and turn it off when there&#039;s no Internet access, or even let it blink, if you know some basic linux scripting/bash <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I&#039;m not sure thought that openwrt&#039;s cron supports &quot;on boot&quot;/&quot;on login&quot; tasks, so you can write a simple script and put it in /etc/init.d</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/bash
gpioctl dirout 7 &amp;&amp; gpioctl set 7</code></pre></div><p>call it &quot;stled&quot; or something, then</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>chmod +x stled</code></pre></div><p>, add a symlink to that file in rc.d folder</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ln -s stled ../rc.d/S99stled</code></pre></div><p>and voila, and it will run every time you boot your DIR-300. Fairly easy <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dark_skeleton</strong> on 25 Nov 2011, 01:09)</p>
