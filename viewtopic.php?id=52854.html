					<p>Hi!</p><p>I have an old 3com 3CRWER100-75 that I would like to use as a bridge to connect a wired unit to a wireless network. I have successfully installed OpenWrt using the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/3com/3crwer100_75">instructions on the wiki</a>, using the latest trunk version as of yesterday.</p><p>But as <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=43285">mentioned elsewhere</a>, it doesn&#039;t have enough memory to install the web GUI (or any packages it seems; 16 MB RAM, 4 MB flash), so I wonder if all the programs I need for such a configuration is available in the base install, or if I do need to compile my own custom firmware? Or should I go for an older, smaller, release?</p><p>NAT&#039;ing the Ethernet-only-device is fine. It just needs to be able to connect outwards (to stream video from the internet to my mother&#039;s TV set).</p><p>I&#039;m new to OpenWRT, but I do program for embedded Linux in $DAYJOB, so I&#039;m no stranger to low-level commands, although our boxes do not have wifi (and a lot more RAM).</p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> This is the setup I want:</p><p>ADSL → modem-router → WiFi → <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/3com/3crwer100_75">3CRWER100-75</a> with OpenWRT → Ethernet-only-device</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nafmo</strong> on 21 Sep 2014, 12:38)</p>

					<p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedclient#using.masquerade">Routed client (Masquerade)</a> requires no additional software, and will give you a NAT-ed connection. <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient">Routed client (relayd)</a> requires that you install relayd, no further packages are needed. I recommend you try relayd if there is room for it. I take it this is for a smart-TV-like device, and as most of them (I believe) can stream video from local video servers (like computers, tablets or smartphones connected to the wireless network) it will work with no changes needed.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sounds good, thanks! I briefly looked at the masquerading guide yesterday evening, good to know that I have everything necessary for it. I am going to visit my mother next weekend, so I might have more questions then :-)</p><p>It is for a satellite receiver, which can also stream video from some public Internet services. She also has a smart TV, but that one does support wi-fi, so I only need it for the receiver.</p>									</div>
