					<p>Hello guys, I have bought this router and I experienced some weird disconnects/loss in signal and speed whereas I have never had such problems with my older router. I decided to try to flash it before I go back to shop and fighting with dealers. I followed this instructions from your website <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300</a> and I did exactly as it says here :</p><p> Barrier Breaker 14.07 provides full support for this router and has Luci (webUI) built-in.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Download openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wdr4300-v1-squashfs-**factory**.bin<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Rename it to the format that the original firmware expects. Something like: wdr4300v1_en_3_14_3_up_boot(150518).bin. Otherwise the page will show error messages like &quot;please select a file to upgrade&quot;.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Connect your PC to a LAN port of the TP-link via ethernet.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Login to the TP-link web administration webpage. (Default address is 192.168.0.1)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Under &#039;System Tools&#039; select &#039;Firmware Upgrade&#039;. Browse to the previously downloaded *.bin file. Click Upgrade.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Connect to <a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a> with your web browser<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Set your password and configure the router through the web UI. Basic Config</p><p>It installed properly and I entered the router settings. Then I tried to configure the PPPoE connection by entering my login and password. It then restarted and STOPPED WORKING. I can&#039;t enter my router even after 10 resets.<br />Please help.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rom4eg</strong> on 12 Dec 2015, 21:04)</p>

					<p>It depends on how bad the corruption is. I&#039;ve found with the latest snapshot for the WDR4300, /etc/config isn&#039;t carried over when using syspugrade. This literally soft bricked my router. Using firstboot had zero effect in failsafe mode before I discovered the actual problem.</p><p>Even using a static IP on my PC did not work (and no, it doesn&#039;t matter whether you use 192.168.1.11 or 10).&nbsp; I had to force the router into recovery, set a manual IP, and issue mtd -r erase rootfs_data. After that, my PC was able to get DHCP, and I was able to wcp over backed up network configs.</p>									</div>
