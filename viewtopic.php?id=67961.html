					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m having some trouble with DNAT, on WNDR3700v2 (for reference, on hnyman&#039;s LEDE build, r1298)<br />I&#039;ve set the firewall to redirect some ports to a Debian machine on my local network, which have itself a firewall which distinguates &quot;local&quot; packets (basically 192.168.x.y) and &quot;foreign&quot; ones (everything else). Amongst redirected ports are smtp-related ports (25/465/587), and torrent port (custom port, 12345).</p><p>The logs on the Debian machine shows that some foreign packets seem to originate from my router.</p><p>I unfortunately can&#039;t reproduce this by hand, as this behaviour seems to be only triggered when a lot of packets arrive : I&#039;ve seen it for Torrent connections (torrent clients are not reputed for their niceness), as well as spamming &quot;relay&quot; attempts.</p><p>Others services are offered on this machine, accessible from the outside (http, imap, etc...), for which I did not see this behaviour, but it doesn&#039;t mean they don&#039;t suffer from the same issue, only that the logs doesn&#039;t exhibit it.</p><p>Did anyone encountered this ? Any ideas to investigate further ?</p><p>For reference, some excerpts from my config.<br />192.168.0.21 is the Debian machine. 192.168.0.254 is the router lan IP.</p><p>/etc/config/firewall<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config redirect

Did you do it from Luci ? It&#039;s what I did, and Reflection is a default on my LEDE build, inside advanced options, which I had to untick. I guess it is a sane default, just not fit for me.</p><p>2) I don&#039;t understand why port forward doesn&#039;t need SNAT. Consider this :<br />(I&#039;ll assume the following machines : 1.1.1.1 is an external &quot;foreign&quot; machine, 9.9.9.9 is my router&#039;s wan IP, 192.168.0.254 is my router lan IP, 192.168.0.21 is a server on my lan)<br />- 1.1.1.1 contact 9.9.9.9 (packet is 1.1.1.1 -&gt; 9.9.9.9)<br />- the router DNATs it to 192.168.0.21. (packet is 1.1.1.1 -&gt; 192.168.0.21)<br />- server replies. packet is (192.168.0.21 -&gt; 1.1.1.1)<br />- shouldn&#039;t router SNAT it, so packet become 9.9.9.9 -&gt; 1.1.1.1 ?<br />(if it didn&#039;t, wouldn&#039;t 1.1.1.1 reject the packet, as it source IP would be 192.168.0.21, different from the original 9.9.9.9 ?)</p><p>3) I still don&#039;t understand why the rejected packet where here in the first place. According to my changes, they where packet emitted from my lan, destinated to my public IP. Which means they are now simply dropped when reaching the initial emitter. <br />Any idea on how to test and debug that ? I guess tcpdump exists on openwrt ? (but my! I&#039;ll have quite a lot of data to process...)</p><p>Anyway, thanks a bunch for your help, I was quite lost !</p><p>(PS : my /etc/firewall.user is empty, already checked)</p>									</div>

					<p>Last post, and conclusions <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />1) The reflection is indeed the cause of the rejected packets on the Debian box.

Capturing packets on the wan port showed them incoming with a private (RFC1918) IP. Strange that OpenWRT doesn&#039;t filter them by default, thought.</p><p>Thanks again eduperez, I&#039;ve learned quite a lot !</p>									</div>
