					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve never used openwrt before and i&#039;d like to know if it is possible to bring well, dual-wan support to openwrt.</p><p>I don&#039;t need load balancing, but what I do need is fail-over and policy-routing.</p><p>Certain traffic has to be routed to another WAN and it&#039;s only if one line fails all traffic would be diverted to the other.</p><p>I have access to all Asus/Linksys routers so if someone can suggest openwrt fulfills my needs I&#039;d go out and purchase one.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>
