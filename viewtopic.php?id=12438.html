					<p>I have a problem with my WRT54GS (no model number specified, so I suspect it&#039;s a version 1.0). I had a previous version of WhiteRussian running on this and decided to flash 0.9. I used the tftp way to flash the firmware. After seemingly successfully flashing the firmware the power led lit up and the dmz led flashed. The ping responses from 192.168.1.1 turned into destination unreachable. The first time I rebooted the router after a couple of minutes and then it just went back in the corrupt firmware state (power led flashing, dmz led slowly turning on and off).</p><p>So now, no matter what firmware I am seemingly able to flash, just turns the router into the same state. I&#039;ve tried Kamikaze, Whiterussian and the stock firmware for WRT54GS 1.0. Nothing brings back my router.</p><p>I have of course also tried failsafe mode, but I don&#039;t see how this can help me when the router clearly reports of a bad firmware.</p><p>So what are my options? What can I do to revive my router?</p>									</div>

					<p>Are you tftping the firmware in &#039;binary&#039; mode instead of &#039;ascii&#039;?&nbsp; Sounds like you&#039;re tftping the images up in ascii mode.</p>									</div>

					<p>Oh, I&#039;m definitely transferring in binary mode. I&#039;ve done this multiple times, but the same happens:</p><p>marius@bounty:~$ tftp 192.168.1.1<br />tftp&gt; binary<br />tftp&gt; rexmt 1<br />tftp&gt; timeout 60<br />tftp&gt; trace<br />Packet tracing on.<br />tftp&gt; status<br />Connected to 192.168.1.1.<br />Mode: octet Verbose: off Tracing: on<br />Rexmt-interval: 1 seconds, Max-timeout: 60 seconds<br />tftp&gt; put openwrt-wrt54gs-squashfs.bin<br />sent WRQ &lt;file=openwrt-wrt54gs-squashfs.bin, mode=octet&gt;<br />received ACK &lt;block=0&gt;<br />sent DATA &lt;block=1, 512 bytes&gt;<br />....<br />sent DATA &lt;block=3027, 0 bytes&gt;<br />received ACK &lt;block=3027&gt;<br />Sent 1549312 bytes in 2.2 seconds</p><p>Then the leds change to a blinking power led and a lit dmz led. I leave the router in this position for a while (I&#039;ve waited up to 30 minutes) and then cycle the power, and I end up back into the aforementioned state (blinking power led and dmz led going on and off).</p>									</div>
