					<p>I have several of these generic routers &quot;3G/4G Router&quot;&nbsp; that are A5-V11 clones but they won&#039;t load an OpenWRT image from their factory firmware upgrade admin page.&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#039;s OK because I was able to use mtd_write with their factory firmware to load a bootloader and OpenWRT image.&nbsp; &nbsp;But before I convert them all, I would like to extract a factory firmware to a bin file, if that is possible in case I want to sell them to a non-literate of OpenWRT later.&nbsp; &nbsp;The idiot proof answer would be to obtain a copy of the factory firmware online but that&#039;s just it, there are no downloadable firmware images for these clones and no known manufacturer.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>So my question is, without being a Linux developer, is there a short set of commands I can try to extract the bootloader and Kernel?&nbsp; &nbsp;Here&#039;s a telnet console (no SSH or FTP with factory firmware, you can mount a USB stick and use mtd_write to load the uboot256.img and OpenWRT.bin and that works OK but I am looking for the reverse.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>M1 login: admin
