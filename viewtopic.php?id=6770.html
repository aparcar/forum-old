					<p>If you read posts in this <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/forum/remark,16514227">thread</a>, there seems to be some works in progress to unlock this PAP2v2. Apparently, a PAP2v2 is a TI-chipset based ATA device running @160MHz with 8/16MB Flash/RAM. Looking through its firmware, I believe one can swear that this PAP2v2 firmware is based on a Linksys WRTP54G firmware source code. If this is the case and the device can be unlocked, I believe it is time to start porting the WiP WRTP54G firmware code to this PAP2v2 along with an asterisk. A PAP2v2 + asterisk should be able to outrun a Linksys SPA9000 in term of price and performance.</p>									</div>

					<p>Holly cow. This got posted a week ago and read by more than 100 readers, yet not response whatsoever. Looks like no one is interested or don&#039;t dare to take the challenge. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>

If you are lucky, your local <a href="http://bestbuy.shoplocal.com/bestbuy/Default.aspx?action=browsepagedetail&amp;storeid=2412846&amp;rapid=301208&amp;pagenumber=7&amp;listingid=-2094614797">BestBuy</a> stores may still have this PAP2v2 (or PAP2 or SPA2002ER) for US$10/each after the instant US$50 Gift Card (OK, you will need to pay the first unit $60+Tax and use the GC to purchase subsequent units by paying the diffrerence, ie. $10 + Tax). This promotion of an instant US$50 GC probably will end by 8/19/6 (today). For about $10/each, this device is definitely not a bad investment to hack, let alone running an asterisk on it.</p>									</div>
