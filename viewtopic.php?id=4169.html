					<p>I tried it before but it didnt&nbsp; work, BUT I tried it again and SUCCESS! (maybe I made some mistake last time)</p><p>I think this 266MHz cpu present on WRAP is much faster than broadcom 4704@ 264MHz from ASUS WL-500gP The FTP transfer rate from WRAP CF card is about 4,1MB/s, but with ASUS transfer from USB stick about 2,5MB/s, both with ~100% cpu usage. I know this test isn&#039;t fully fair but I think it shows that Geode is faster than broadcom @ the same MHz.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Marek</strong> on 8 Apr 2007, 21:30)</p>
