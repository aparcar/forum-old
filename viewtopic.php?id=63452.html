					<p>I&#039;m trying to read the RSSI of the devices connected to my router with <strong>airodump-ng mon0</strong> and <strong>iw dev wlan0 station dump</strong>, I&#039;m running my own C++ code on it, this is mainly what my C++ code is doing:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>FILE *f = popen(&quot;airodump-ng mon0 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep :&quot;,&quot;r&quot;);<br />if(f==0) return 1;<br />char buf[512];<br />while(fgets(buf,512,f)){<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; //process_data<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; //sends processed data thru UDP to a local server<br />}</p></blockquote></div><p>The code works perfectly, but after running it in background for a couple minutes the router stops working at all, WiFi drops and the only way to get the router working again is by a hard reset.</p><p>Am I doing anything wrong? Is there any way I can debug what&#039;s going on?</p><p>I have no idea what is making it freeze.</p>									</div>

					<p>My suggestion was write your own code, it wasn&#039;t compile linux.c, in linux.c there is the code that you should read to understand how to write your own code to read rssi, it&#039;s a easy thing, you can read packets RSSI and MAC addresses with a few lines of C code, without use airodump-ng at all.</p><p>If it&#039;s not a RAM problem I don&#039;t know how the program can crash the whole router.</p><p>By the other side, if you want to improve your code with pipes, you can use &quot;rb&quot; instead of &quot;r&quot; in popen, and &quot;fread&quot; instead &quot;fgets&quot; to work with binary arrays instead strings.</p><p>Good luck.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello cabada,</p><p>I&#039;ve started a project similar to yours, using C code. If you want, we can share advices and source code in this thread.<br />I&#039;m using a ath9k htc dongle for my tests.</p><p>In order to keep iPhone or any other device sending data to measure its RSSI you can do a ping from router to iPhone.</p><p>My device use radiotap headers to send the RSSI.</p><p>I start the dongle with the next commands.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ifconfig wlan0 down
iw wlan0 del
iw phy0 interface add wlan0 type monitor
airmon-ng start wlan0</code></pre></div><p>and I read the RSSI of radiotap, and MAC&#039;s of ieee80211 using C code with packet sockets.</p><p>More info about radiotap headers here <a href="http://www.radiotap.org/">http://www.radiotap.org/</a></p><p>Remember disable the wifi device in openwrt before start monitor mode, maybe that is what freeze your router.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>iasimov</strong> on 10 Apr 2016, 10:51)</p>
