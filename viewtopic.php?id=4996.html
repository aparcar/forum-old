					<p>I am having some problems creating a customised firmware using RC4.</p><p>Previously, I have been creating customised OpenWRT firmware builds that include a C++ application I wrote, as well as some firewall configurations and things like that.&nbsp; Previously, I have just dumped all of the non-standard files into the &#039;packages/base-files/default&#039; directory and run &#039;make&#039; in order to create the firware image.</p><p>I have now added to the functionality of my C++ app, and wish to incorporate it into a new firmware build.&nbsp; I have had to shift development environments between the previous firmware build and the current one, so have set up RC4 on the new platform and copied the non-standard files into the &#039;packages/base-files/default&#039; as I have always done, however this seems to have no effect on the resulting firmware image - the image ends up being a straight-up OpenWRT firmware without any of the customisations.&nbsp; I even tried setting up RC3 and making the firmware under it, as this is what I had used previously, but with the same result.</p><p>Any ideas on why the firmware customisations would not be working?</p>									</div>
