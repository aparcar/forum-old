					<p>Thanks to geoffw for this thread and after spending a day of trial/error and research I finally was able to build Squid 3.5 for mipsel on the openwrt variant for rt-n56u/rt-n65u/rt-n65r routers</p><p>It uses ralink chipset (rt3883) which is slightly different so I had to use their toolchain with 3.x kernel</p><p><a href="https://code.google.com/p/rt-n56u/wiki/HowToMakeFirmware">https://code.google.com/p/rt-n56u/wiki/ … keFirmware</a></p><p>Just to add some tips for people trying this in the future:</p><p>I made a clean new Debian install in a VMware box, my centos wasn&#039;t cutting it</p><p>I had to build under /home/ instead of /opt/ for space reasons</p><p>This is what my environment exports looked like:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>export  PATH=&quot;/home/slug/rt-n56u/toolchain-rt3883/toolchain-3.0.x/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin&quot;
export STAGING_DIR=&quot;/home/slug/rt-n56u/toolchain-rt3883/toolchain-3.0.x&quot;
export CC=mipsel-linux-uclibc-gcc 
export LD=mipsel-linux-uclibc-ld</code></pre></div><p>(yes I put the cross compiler path first just to be certain the local gcc wasn&#039;t used)</p><p>I ran into a problem with cf_gen, which is built for the mipsel environment but then the makefile tries to execute locally. So to fix that you first have to compile locally without cross-compile and skipping the above environment so it makes cf_gen for x86_64 - then copy it and patch the Makefile. You can find the instructions here:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/pjq/squid/tree/master#issues-1">https://github.com/pjq/squid/tree/master#issues-1</a></p><p>My configure triplet looked like this</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>./configure --build=x86_64-linux-gnu --host=mipsel-linux-uclibc --target=mipsel-linux-uclibc</code></pre></div><br /><p>But I also ran into a problem where the compiler would quit on warnings, Squid 3.5 introduces a bunch of new stuff, specifically ftprelay was causing the warning-&gt;fatal and I won&#039;t be using anything but port 80 so I disabled the fatal warning with <strong>--disable-strict-error-checking</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>There is one last problem I ran into that I have not solved yet:</strong></p><p>could not enable Tproxy4 <a href="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/Tproxy4">http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/Tproxy4</a></p><p>this is because even though I can install libcap 2.24 on the router via opkg entware, there is no libcap or libcap-dev in the toolchain on the cross-compiler side?</p><p>I am not sure how to resolve that, I guess I could copy the libcap files from the router back to the toolchain but libcap-dev package does not exist and not sure how to create it</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>_ck_</strong> on 8 Dec 2014, 15:14)</p>
