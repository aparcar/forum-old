					<p>My guess: <br />during the boot process the router sets the time based on the last timestamp of any file in /etc directory. Sysntpd starts rather late, so it is quite possible that when cron gets started, the router still thinks that the time is 23:59:00 or something like that (in case there has been no file activity in /etc immediately before the reboot). And midnight arrives then after one minute uptime, and it is time to boot again :-)</p><p>You might check what is the time right after the boot (with logread, uptime, time or whatever).</p><p>Suggested cure: <br />create a script to be run with cron. <br />In the script<br />- sleep 5 seconds<br />- touch /etc/banner&nbsp; &nbsp;(to set its timestamp to 00:00:05)<br />- reboot</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 11 May 2014, 22:32)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m rebooting it monthly because I&#039;m implementing the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ImmutableServer.html">immutable server pattern</a>.&nbsp; I&#039;m storing the configuration for the router in a private Bitbucket Git repository.&nbsp; When the router reboots it erases itself, clones the repository, and runs a provisioning script from the repository.</p><p>I&#039;ve installed the router in a remote location without physical access.&nbsp; This process gives me confidence that I can update the configuration as needed simply by pushing new changes to the Git repository, and that it if gets itself into any trouble then it will get a fresh start at least every month.</p>									</div>
