					<p>I&#039;m running 10.03.1, and I&#039;m having this issue:<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/10059">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/10059</a></p><p>Essentially, even though my WAN interface is set with a static IP, it will only hold that IP address for an undetermined period of time and then it will receive an IP address from the DHCP server of the network it&#039;s connected to.&nbsp; This happens with every instance I&#039;ve deployed.&nbsp; Typically, it&#039;s not an issue because there usually is no DHCP server where I&#039;ve been assigned a static IP, or if I&#039;m using a static IP on the WAN port, I can disable any DHCP servers on the network to which the WAN port connects.&nbsp; But in some cases, I don&#039;t have that control, so I lose my static WAN IP.&nbsp; Bringing the interface down and back up resolves the problem for some period of time again, but not permanently.</p><p>Any help would be appreciated!</p>									</div>
