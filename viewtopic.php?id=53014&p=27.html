					<p>Ouch. I can&#039;t help with bootloader.</p><p>I have a weird problem with mine that perhaps someone can help with:</p><p>My device has two WiFi connections. One is an AP with SSID DragoNAS (Yes, the pun is intentional) and the other a client connection to the home Internet modem. The two are bridged via LuCi&#039;s settings so that the AP allows Internet from the home modem.</p><p>For some reason, if I take the router outside of my home, the AP fails to appear at all. I&#039;d like to set it up as a portable NAS device (thus the name), but if I cannot connect to it at all, it isn&#039;t very useful (Yes, it has Ethernet, but my OTHER devices don&#039;t). I tried <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=64507">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=64507</a></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
TIMEOUT=60
SLEEP=5
sleep 20
[ &quot;$(cat /sys/class/gpio/gpio19/value)$(cat /sys/class/gpio/gpio20/value)&quot; = &quot;11&quot; ] || exit 0 # repeater mode
. /usr/share/libubox/jshn.sh
check_radio() { json_load &quot;$(/bin/ubus call network.wireless status)&quot;; json_select $1; json_get_vars up; return $up; }
sta_err=0
while [ $((sta_err * SLEEP)) -lt $TIMEOUT ]; do
    check_radio radio0 -gt 0 &amp;&amp; exit 0
    let sta_err=$sta_err+1; sleep $SLEEP
done    
for i in $(seq 0 9); do [ &quot;$(uci -q get wireless.@wifi-iface[$i].mode)&quot; = &quot;sta&quot; ] &amp;&amp; uci set wireless.@wifi-iface[$i].disabled=1 &amp;&amp; uci commit wireless; done
/sbin/wifi up
exit 0</code></pre></div><p>but it would seem that the script does not ever detect the WiFi as actually being down. It also permanently disables the client connection, when I would rather get it to re-enable on reboot of the device (have it NOT save the disabled state in the flash memory). I managed to get both to work, with a change to a ping of Google and some tinkering with removing the command that saves to Flash, but I do not know what autorun-on-boot method to use that works with the firmware creation tools for the router. I would like to not have to SCP this over everytime I reflash it.</p><p>Ideally, I would like a more elegant solution that avoids this entirely (some change so that the AP won&#039;t drop in the first place) or at least skips the ping command for instead reading whether the AP is up or not (or client in range of modem), but this was the only solution I found, and that part did not work, simply ALWAYS triggering, Internet or no. </p><p>TL;DR: I need to get the router to bring up the AP at all times, even if the bridged client on the same radio is not in range. I believe this is a won&#039;tfix bug, but if it is not, how do I get this to happen?</p><p>If it is, how do I detect whether it is not connected, or the AP is down? Preferably without ping, and the script above DOES NOT WORK. The file being parsed exists, but is never updated, always showing that it&#039;s online, if if it is wrong.<br />THEN, I need to get this into the firmware image so that it is always run on boot, OR when the reset button is pressed. </p><p>(I am using the command files=FILES/ in the make command for the image, where the files I add are in the FILES/ directory. This works fine for other files, but I need to get this set up as one (ideally) file in a directory where it runs on boot and will not get automatically deleted. rc.local is less than ideal, as it would overwrite anything that uses it, plus it is not always enabled.)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rdragonrydr</strong> on 18 May 2017, 05:26)</p>

					<p>Hi. My TM02 is running OpenWrt Chaos Calmer r44945 / LuCI Master (git-15.079.29361-3e37216), kernel 3.18.9. I&#039;d like to revert back to original HooToo configuration as I bought it with. Like an idiot I didn&#039;t save the content of the USB stick I installed OpenWRT with. I&#039;ve got fw-WiFiPort-HooToo-TM02-2.000.022 as a file from HooToo support. How can I use that to revert to stock configuration? Thanks for any advice.</p>									</div>

					<p>Can you attach the file or send it to me somehow? I can probably tell you if it the firmware file.</p><p>I don&#039;t know if it has changed or will need to change the bootloader, though, so I&#039;m not certain it will work. This sort of thing has a possibility of bricking the router.</p><p>The way you can tell is by running binwalk on the file and looking for a kernel, squashfs, and so on.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rdragonrydr</strong> on 27 Jun 2017, 15:39)</p>

					<p>Whoops, that looks like the OEM image. That can&#039;t be installed (as-is) via OpenWRT, that I know of. It&#039;s actually a shell script that contains binary data, which is executed/installed by scripts on the original firmware. You could try copying it to the router and running it, but I have no idea if it would work at all. (It might check for data or commands or paths that don&#039;t exist in OpenWRT.) </p><p>I have heard that you can possibly strip out the shell script part and treat it as a normal image, though (and then installed with the normal image installation method, either web or commandline). This might be possible with a text editor, even, but I don&#039;t know if it would get corrupted.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rdragonrydr</strong> on 27 Jun 2017, 16:55)</p>

					<p>Hi guys!&nbsp; Really new to all this openwrt stuff so please bear with me.&nbsp; I have my TM04 running well but cannot seem to figure out how to share the USB stick with the network.&nbsp; I do not think it is mounting.&nbsp; When I check the system log I believe it is recognized as sda but cannot seem to share it at all because I think samba needs to share a mount point not sda.&nbsp; Can someone please lead me in the right direction.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>iamwally</p>									</div>

					<p>In reading those 2 links you gave me I think I see a problem.&nbsp; My menu does not seem to have a mount points option.&nbsp; Is it missing in this version of openwrt for a reason or is it just something I am doing wrong?&nbsp; That is why I cannot share it because I cannot set a mount point.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Iamwally</p>									</div>

					<p>@rdragonrydr</p><p>While I am sure some will disagree, from a practical perspective, under OpenWRT, I do not see a way (meaning config vs scripts with some level of complexity) to switch between AP\STA mode and using the device as an AP on your internal LAN.&nbsp; I gave up on this long ago.&nbsp; </p><p>Yes, there is a switch, do not recall it it can be programed under OpenWrt for this device, but if it can, it can be used to alternate between &quot;Saved Configs&quot; for the scenarios, if not, it&#039;s all manual (and in my opinion not worth the hassle, buy a second box)</p><p>Regarding the AP\STA issues, the loss of AP when the configured STAtion is well noted in the forums and I believe has been reported as a bug that will not be fixed.</p><p>If you go between a few STAtions regularly I think&nbsp; dibdot <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=67697">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=67697</a> has the best solution at the moment; if you hop around, your safest bet is to run a small script on boot to delete the currently configured STAtion.</p>									</div>

					<p>I will be trying that if I can. I actually have such a script, but to be happy with it, I would have to get the connection detector working better and run it at startup, neither of which do I know how to do. At that point, it would act much the same as the travelmate package, so I will just see if I can install that.</p>									</div>
