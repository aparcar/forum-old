					<p>Hi all,<br />two of the specified devices happen to fall in my hands after a garage sale, i have been looking on the wiki and online on advice about setting up openwrt on the device but they seem to not be supported or not too available.<br />I have a picture of the board, here it is</p><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/pxm4jhx.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/pxm4jhx.jpg</a></p><p>and i have some little proficency in embedded programming (i can get openwrt to build with patches, if necessary). Would there be any interest in the device? i am also trying to understand if i can access it via serial, but there seems to be no soldered base on the board, but i&#039;m ignorant about hardware.<br />Thanks for any info,<br />bye</p>									</div>
