Many aspects should already be familiar if you build OpenWrt from source. Unless a minor distribution there likely is a lot of documentation about getting the toolchain, getting the kernel sources, configuring and building a kernel and adding an entry for your own kernel to your bootloader.</p><p>Systemd folks at some point noticed they broke booting without an initramfs but it was to late to fix it, so you will likely also have to build one and tell the bootloader about it. Luckily there are tools like dracut which make this a lot less painful.</p><p>In the end, the difficult part is probably to figure out what hardware you have an which drivers you need for it. Depending on what software you intend to run you also need certain features. This might be somewhat daunting at first but you can always start with the distributions .config and slowly remove what you think you do not need and check what (if anything) broke.</p><p>Kernels for binary distributions are usually really fat, so there is a lot you can strip out, you will likely only need 1-2% of it and the rest is bloat. If they want to support just about everything with a single image they do not have much choice in this matter though.</p>									</div>

					<p>Right now I am just very disappointed in the WRT1200AC, <strong>especially</strong> wuth the 2.4G band</p><p>Get this - I plugged in an AR9271 USB and it even came up as a 802.11 Generic Controller, and STILL pulled better perfomance than the Marvell 88W8864 could muster up at VERY close range and from afar. Even with worse signal the AR9271 performance was BETTER than the 88W8864 which gave me better signal.</p><p>This is also the behavior for the 5G band as well, which only pulls N performance at moderate distances.</p><p>I need suggestions, is there ANY way I can improve the speed? Perhaps use another firmware? Please do NOT give me basic suggestions like &quot;Make sure the channel is 1, 6 or 11&quot; I&#039;ve already debunked those because<strong> in the same conditions the AR9271 was performing better than the 88W8864, almost in the exact same spot.</strong> I need fixes because I am getting angry that I wasted money on a product that&#039;s inferior to my N150 device. The only thing I can do is get a replacement from Linksys, but I am scared that I&#039;ll get the same results, and I&#039;ll be very peeved by then.</p><p>Note: I also get the same results on the stock firmware so I&#039;ve ruled that out.</p><p>I saw someone else that reported in this thread the same problem, I am with you sir, this thing is terrible.

					<p>There are lots of possible reasons why one router will perform better than another at the same location.</p><p>I would guess that the better antennas of the 1200ac are hearing more other stations than your USB device is, and therefor sees less time that the band is idle and is able to transmit.</p><p>try doing iw &lt;dev&gt; scan on both radios and see how many different things they each see.</p>									</div>

					<p>Considering how many manufacturers bowed out after the new FCC rules came out, I&#039;m just happy that Marvel stayed in the game. Yes, it&#039;s going to take a long time to get the Wifi driver working right... For me at least, it&#039;s about the &quot;Router&quot; and all the features, and not so much about the Wifi end of it. Because I put so much value on OpenWrt/Lede, I would be willing to buy a Wifi AP, and just plug it into the router, and work that way, if that&#039;s what it meant for me to keep OpenWrt/Lede going. A lot of people were bent out of shape when it took forever to get the 1900ac Wifi working right, and we went through it again with the 3200acm (I don&#039;t blame them), but with Opensource we can&#039;t always predict or demand things be working immediately as much as we want them to.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davidc502</strong> on 23 May 2017, 21:35)</p>

Also as long as it&#039;s an out of tree driver there is little incentive to work on anything but build fixes / porting to more recent kernels anyway.</p><p>As an access point Shelby works fine for me, supports all features I need. Just like davidc502 I don&#039;t need the wireless bit as I had a working setup before which I could have continued to use instead. The important bit for me it&#039;s a true gigabit router which can be used with any Linux distribution, has the looks to be placed in the living room and doesn&#039;t eat all that much power (a lot less than the old setup at least).</p><p>Also when I said not a seasoned open source developer I didn&#039;t mean not able to work on the code properly but dealing with the community in a way that doesn&#039;t cause frustration on both ends which is an entirely different skill set. Dealing with proprietary and open source customers is quite different after all.</p>									</div>

So in 4.13 you wont need any extra patches. For 4.12 grab the patches 1-3 in the latest swrt under target/linux/mvebu/patches-4.12. The ones you currently use probably wont do, as I also had to adjust the bindings for the new driver.</p><p>Btw, the dtsi rework and Rango addition got merged for the most part as well already (11 out of 13 patches). So the missing mwlwifi driver will basically be the only missing bit.</p>									</div>
