					<p>Hi,</p><p>So I&#039;m new here.<br />I&#039;m facing an issue where my laptop needs to connect to my work Intranet via a VPN connection.<br />Since I upgraded my router to OpenWRT it doesn&#039;t work. From the error mentioning GRE, i figured it was using PPPT</p><p>After searching i have installed a few packages that helped a bit. Now my laptop does connect to the VPN, but it looks like the firewall is blocking all connections behind that, and I cannot open any sites, web or intranet. I&#039;ve read about the need to do some forwarding maybe but have no clue</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>									</div>

And few people would call the resulting solicitation of unrequested, unhelpful content &quot;volunteering&quot;, but I digress.</p><p>@matthieu.pierre while I do not have the time/knowledge to help you in your real question, I can offer the advise to simply ignore Mr. Hopper. Have a look at his posting to this forum (<a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/search.php?action=show_user_posts&amp;user_id=141227">https://forum.openwrt.org/search.php?ac â€¦ _id=141227</a>), the probability that he actually offers helpful advise is pretty slim....</p><p>@Max, what happened, you seemed so much more at easy and friendly last week, but now you are back to the old habits, why?</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>

					<p>@Max, I&#039;m used to forums and far from me the notion to demand anything? I just find myself in a territory (networks and firewall) i know little about and as it seem the solution existed i just tried to bump my post...</p><p>I do appreciate the time people take to help the community on forums and myself try to assist where I can on other forum where i&#039;m more knowledgeable....</p>									</div>

					<p>@Max,</p><p>I do work from home overseas from my HQ. I have to get myself sorted for that sort of things...<br />Luckyly i only need the VPN avery couple of days to access certain services on intranet and I have been using my 3G connection for that until I have tiome to sort the router.</p><p>Initially the VPN on my laptop did not connect at all and gave that error about GRE. So I managed to find infos (post i added in OP) that guided me to some modules that needed to be installed. So now the VPN does connect but I cannot access the services which makes me think the Firewall is blocking the communication and all I need is to tell the Firewall to allow all traffic on that protocol</p>									</div>

					<p>Without specifics about your configuration, it is a bit difficult to offer any help... If you can establish the VPN connection, I would bet the problem is not in your firewall, but in your routing tables. Please, post your configuration files here (network and VPN client), and also the output of &quot;ip route&quot;.</p>									</div>

					<p>hi,</p><p>thanks. There is no VPN client as such, it is the built in windows vpn connection client that is used.<br />the result of ip route, must that be will the vpn is connected? must it be from my laptop (connected to the vpn)?</p><p>regarding the config files, i&#039;m not sure what file you need for network. is it something i can extract from openwrt?</p>									</div>
