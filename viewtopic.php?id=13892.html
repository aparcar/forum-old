					<p>Calling all OpenWRT experts out there!</p><p>I need a working copy of RC0.9 on an Airlink AR360W3G that functions with a 3G aircard. I think that the aircard logic is self contained in the pc card so should not be affected too much by the install of the new OS but you will need to be expert enough to work this out.</p><p>Will need a JFFS file system set up in the flash - I believe it has 32 MB.</p><p>Willing to pay for the work and the hardware needed - will post the project on Elance if required so if anyone is interested then please get in touch.</p><p>The router is sold through Frys Electronics / Outpost.com</p><p>There will be quite a lot of new work in the future too.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Steve</p>									</div>

					<p>Can you send me the developer&#039;s info?&nbsp; I can probably come up with the $700, but I would want the work done on Kamikaze.&nbsp; </p><p>I&#039;m also trying to figure out if the RDC port on the trunk will work on this router.&nbsp; The RDC port works on the 525 and the wiki seems to indicate that the 525 and the 360 have the same Soc except one has USB support (3210) and one does not (3211).</p>									</div>
