					<p>i spent now around 2h reading about meshing but there seems quite a lot of stuff around, a bit confusing.</p><p>There are multiple different ways of meshing, 802.11s seems to be old and included in Openwrt, then is OLSR which there is no more development and B.A.T.M.A.N which is available as package in Openwrt.</p><p>I read that such ad-hoc networks require manual ip configuration on the client if it doesnt run in infrastructure mode? Does this apply to all modes above? </p><p>In 802.11s there is 3 different submodes: mesh station, mesh access point and mesh point portal.<br />Is this included in openwrt? Other modes like B.A.T.M.A.N also have this? </p><p>Is this a solution which could be used in i.e. hotel where only password is entered on client?</p>									</div>

					<p>To add another alternative for your research, check out the Babel mesh solution. It&#039;s a package in OpenWrt, and was used very successfully for three years as the primary routing protocol in the CeroWrt project <a href="http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/cerowrt/wiki">http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/cerowrt/wiki</a></p><p>The github repo at <a href="https://github.com/jech/babeld">https://github.com/jech/babeld</a> has a README that has instructions for building on OpenWrt (that&#039;s probably been done for the OpenWrt package) and talks about setting up babeld.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve used 802.11s.&nbsp; The advantages include that it is built in, and has good interoperability between different hardware and software versions.</p><p>Realize that all three of the station types start by setting up a mesh interface that connects to the other routers.&nbsp; <br />The &quot;mesh access point&quot; configuration adds a standard AP interface for non-mesh aware users to use.<br />The &quot;mesh portal&quot; configuration has a connection (usually wired Ethernet) to another network, which is usually a path to the Internet.<br />These functions are all built in to OpenWrt and can be activated by editing the config/wireless and config/network files.&nbsp; </p><p>Optionally you can make a mesh portal advertise that it is the portal on the mesh, which improves routing performance.&nbsp; &nbsp;When a mesh is set up to provide Internet access, almost all traffic on that mesh will be to or from the Internet.</p><p>You can run DHCP over a mesh if you don&#039;t want to administer the addresses of clients, for example if you want to allow third parties to bring their own hardware and join your mesh.&nbsp; In most small networks you will usually want to use static IP for the backbone mesh nodes so you can always find each router to administer it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 18 Jun 2015, 16:44)</p>

					<p>I&#039;ve been using cjdns for mesh networking for a while now and it I really like it.. not sure why batman-adv and the others always get first mention..</p><p>In fact I just bought a router (my first for openwrt) and flashed it with openwrt a few days ago and installed the cjdns opkg which was super easy and had a meshnet up in no time.</p><p>Is there some issues with cjdns that I don&#039;t know about that causes it to be overlooked in most cases?</p>									</div>

I suspect the answer is that a) the science of mesh networks isn&#039;t settled, so there are *lots* of experiments going on (this is a good thing), and b) that it&#039;s &quot;just a little too hard&quot; to learn about and set it up.</p><p>I&#039;m on a team to improve the OpenWrt documentation, and I would encourage all of you who have experience with a particular protocol to write it up in the Wiki (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org">http://wiki.openwrt.org</a>). </p><p>We have people who&#039;re using the following:</p><p>B.A.T.M.A.N<br />batman-adv<br />cjdns<br />80211s<br />babel</p><p>If each had a HOWTO (see <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/start">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/start</a> ), with a short description of what the facility would do, and simple steps to get it going, we&#039;d all be better off.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have some interest in batman-adv and learning more about mesh networks. I figured the best way to learn would be to use it in a real world scenario.</p><p>Would it be possible to setup a few (cheap) OpenWRT routers running batman-adv (or other mesh tech), to provide a seamless home wi-fi network? </p><p>I&#039;m thinking 1 primary router connected to the internet through a DSL/CableModem and then 3 or 4 additional openwrt routers spread around the house (for coverage) connected together wirelessly in a mesh network and broadcasting a single SSID (each openwrt router would also act as a Access Point)? DHCP would be used and served off the primary router.</p><p>Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>King0fK0ng</strong> on 19 Jun 2015, 23:53)</p>
