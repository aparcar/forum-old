					<p>I have openwrt 8.09.(2) installed on an Engenius 1650. Works fine and very comparable to DIR-300s and Nanostaion2 and Fonera+ I also tested.</p><p>Until I issue a simple <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>reboot</code></pre></div><p>on the machine.</p><p>I have a little script in init.s that is called by cron every morning at 4am local time which reboots the router. I have hooked the router to a remote loggin server to see what happens and that is it:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Nov 20 04:00:02 60-234-221-116.bitstream.orcon.net.nz crond[1147]: USER root pid 20467 cmd /etc/init.d/chilli_startup start

The machine response to that command in so far as it &#039;closes up&#039; that is it is not contactable anymore through ping or other wise but does not enter a complete reboot routine - as I can tell by watching the LEDs.</p><p>To ensure it is not my script I issues a &#039;reboot&#039; on the command line and got the same effect. When I issue a command line reboot I get this through the remote logging:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Nov 20 07:15:01 60-234-221-116.bitstream.orcon.net.nz init: init: starting pid 2004, tty &#039;&#039;: &#039;/etc/init.d/rcS K stop&#039;
Nov 20 07:15:03 60-234-221-116.bitstream.orcon.net.nz root: stopping ntpclient</code></pre></div><p>The machine will recover fine if I force a hard reboot by pulling the power plug.</p><p>I notice the same effect when flashing a new firmware version and using the mtd -r command. The flash will happen alright, but the reboot at the nd does not. When issuing a reboot command on redboot, the machine will reboot fine.</p><p>The log would suggest there is an issue with the /etc/init.d/rcS K stop script but looking at that, it does not actually do much.</p><p>Is there something I am doing wrong or awe looking at a bug here? Any advice welcome.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>chillifire</strong> on 19 Nov 2009, 20:26)</p>

					<p>Thanks for following up and solving the issue.<br />Well, its nice that a fix was found but this leave me with two questions:</p><p>1) Why does that only create a problem for the Engenius devices - all other atheros devices I tested including Nano2, Fon+, Fon2, and Dir300 work fine with that patch and reboot as expected. </p><p>2) What does this now take away from the watchdog? Does that mean watchdog will not reboot the system, if it gets into trouble? What is the impact of reversing the patch, is I guess what I am asking.</p><p>The patch was signed in by &#039;cr&#039;. Could maybe the developer leave a comment in this thread? Much appreciated.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for pointing this out. I had a quick look at th code there is nothing in there that jumps at me which ould ugest the system is ware it handles a 2315 vs. a 2317 vs. a 5315 processor and so forth.

					<p>Hi all,</p><p>It turns out my &#039;fix&#039; for EAP-3660 in post No5 was no fix at all!<br />Here&#039;s what happened:</p><p>1.) Identified the reboot command problem when Wireless was already activated.<br />2.) Modified the code as specified in post No5, re-flash, and test.<br />3.) The unit reboots - WOW fixed! ...... NOT SO FAST!!!! :-( <br />4.) As soon as the Wireless is activated, the reboot command does not work.</p><p>Can it be that the EAP-3660 use yet another GPIO reset pin?

					<p>The patch I posted works out-of-the-box for the EOC 1650.

					<p>@albe</p><p>Thanks for the suggestions - did not even knew about the gpioctl command -very handy. </p><p>I tried the gpioctl command this morning and the unit sure reboots on a clear of the following pins: 0,32,64.</p><p>When I edit the patch file (100-board.patch) and I run a make V=99 again, will it apply the changes I&#039;ve made to the patch to the new build?</p><p>Somehow I&#039;ve got a suspicion that the changes to the patch does not end up in the new build.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried a make clean, but it leaves some files which then make complains about and refuse to build when I run make again.</p><p>I&#039;ve now tried make distclean and will see how it goes - its doing a lot of downloading again. </p><p>Yes I&#039;m the YFi developer.</p><p>I&#039;m now working on an add-on which can be used to centrally store OpenWRT device&#039;s configuration.<br />The idea is to have a minimal firmware which causes the unit to boot, get a DHCP addrress and then contact the YFi server, giving its MAC as identification.<br />The YFi server then hands the unit its settings to it (IE Network, Wireless, OpenVPN tunnel etc).<br />The unit then reconfigures itself according to the settings given, restart its network.</p><p>This will enable us to pre-flash the units with a standard firmware, no additional set-up is then needed (our network uses DHCP)<br />Swap out&#039;s will be a simple manner of replacing a mac entry in the YFi web front-end.<br />New units installations should also be a snap because we can pre-populate a list of units in YFi and assign the MAC&#039;s to the settings as the deployment evolves.</p><p>But for all this to work - we need to be able to reset the unit through software!<br />And that&#039;s&nbsp; how I end up on this problem!</p><p>The EAP-3660 is an ideal candidate since it is cheap, and supports POE out of the box.</p><p>Cheers</p>									</div>
