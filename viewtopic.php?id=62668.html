					<p>Hi,</p><p>I want to replace an TL-WR841N/ND v9 running OpenWrt Barrier Breaker r40730 / LuCI Trunk (svn-r10180) <br />with a TL-WR1043ND *V3.0* running the latest OpenWrt trunk .<br />The WAN port is connected to an Arris cable modem, which gives one public IPv4-Address via DHCP.<br />Everything works for years with the TL-WR841N/ND v9. </p><p>The new TL-WR1043ND V3.0 doesn&#039;t get an IP-Address from the cable modem via DHCP. I have to remove&nbsp; the cable of the WAN port for a short time to get an IP Address from the cable modem. I have to do this after every reboot and when the DHCP lease expires.</p><p>Connecting the WAN port of the TL-WR1043ND V3.0 to a LAN port of the old TL-WR841ND and it gets an IP-Address instantly (sure, 2 different Networks), even after a reboot.</p><p>The Warning/Gotchas in <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd</a> apply only to V1 and V2 of the TL-WR1043ND </p><p>The WAN port works, but not with the cable modem....<br />udhcpc parameters are the same on both routers.</p><p>What can I do for further investigations ?</p><p>I got another TP-Link TL-WR841N/ND v9 and flashed it with OpenWrt Designated Driver r48648. It works out of the box ..<br />It seems not to be an udhcpc-software problem.</p><p>Any hints ?</p><p>Thanks<br />g</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>grautvornix</strong> on 11 Feb 2016, 19:06)</p>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>it becomes more and more strange ...<br />Putting a switch between WAN-Port of the router and the cable-modem I get a WAN-Address&nbsp; at least after a reboot ...<br />I checked it more than once .<br />Seems to be a timing or an electrical problem ... I&#039;ll ask my ISP for a new modem.</p><p>Thanks<br />g</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>grautvornix</strong> on 13 Feb 2016, 23:26)</p>
