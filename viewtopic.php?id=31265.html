					<p>May I ask why we do not have any comments in any configuration files located in the /etc/config/* folder? It would make it a whole lot easier to read and understand what is happening. I agree that Wiki is a great source of information, but it is incomplete and sometimes even incorrect, always un-accessible without internet connection. Here is an example from /etc/config/firewall that demonstrates how a single comment can clarify lots of guesswork for people not familiar with the OpenWRT default configuration.</p><p>#Allows router to respond to pings<br />config &#039;rule&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;src&#039; &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;icmp&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;icmp_type&#039; &#039;echo-request&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;family&#039; &#039;ipv4&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;target&#039; &#039;ACCEPT&#039;</p><p>Reading *.config files without comments is like reading raw, un-commented source code. </p><p>1. Comments will make it easier to maintain configuration files<br />2. Prevent obvious configuration mistakes<br />3. Warn about specific settings<br />4. Make config files easier to understand for new users</p><p>Please let me know what you think?</p>									</div>

					<p>@scruffy - good point about the sticky policy on this forum. 4 out of 5 stickies deal with Kamikaze releases. I think they are due for an update.</p><p>@hnyman - thanks for pointing this out. Hopefully this will be fixed soon. These comments are very helpful, especially if you ever come back to reconfigure a router after you have not touched it for 5 years.</p>									</div>
