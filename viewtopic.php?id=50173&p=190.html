					<p>I hate to clog this thread, but I don&#039;t&nbsp; know if if this is an issue with our build or if things are working as intended...</p><p>Did my first upgrade via sysupgrade over the weekend, and fo0und that no settings were preserved.&nbsp; Apparently the default /etc/sysupgrade.conf file doesn&#039;t by default contain what should be preserved, just a few commented lines.&nbsp; Shouldn&#039;t the default file actually contain some barebones defaults on what should be preserved during an upgrade?&nbsp; How does one know what is important to preserve and what isn&#039;t?</p><p>Also, presumably a separate issue, after the upgrade, several packages that had been installed had to be reinstalled.&nbsp; Can sysupgraded handle reinstalling packages, or is there some other way people are handling this?&nbsp; I know I can generate a list of installed packages, but I can&#039;t see an easy way to know what the differences from stock are.</p><p>Lastly, totally separate issue.&nbsp; I&#039;m testing the WRT1900AC on my existing Lan, so the WAN IP on my unit is 192.168.1.123, and the LAN address on the 1900 is the default 192.168.1.1, my home router is 192.168.1.2, so all IPs are unique.&nbsp; Even though the 1900 is configured to respond to ping on the WAN port, it doesn&#039;t, and my attempts at opening ports are apparently failing, a port scan isn&#039;t showing any open ports on the WAN IP.&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking that there may be some issue because both LAN and WAN are using the same IP range?&nbsp; I ran out of time this weekend to play with reconfiguring that, thought I&#039;d check here to see if this was a known issue or not.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure I&#039;m not the only one here with multiple OpenWRT devices on a single network.&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>
