					<p>I&#039;d like to try openwrt. But I didn&#039;t see any support for E2100L. Right now I am using dd-wrt but really don&#039;t like wireless/wired speed between router and other devices. I got much faster speed on original firmware that is why I was interesting to get telnet/ssh connection to original firmware. <br />If openwrt will be fine with this, I definitely use it, but I haven&#039;t try it, as didn&#039;t see build for E2100L.</p>									</div>

					<p>I used v.90&#039;s factory bin posted back in November. It updated through the Linksys web interface. I&#039;m not going to be using the device as a router, so I&#039;m not sure about some of the other issues mentioned, but for my purposes it is working fine.</p><p>One note. Although the /etc/openwrt_release says it&#039;s 10.03, since v.90 build this off of svn, it&#039;s using the kernel from 10.03.1-rc4. You&#039;ll need to change your opkg.conf to using 10.03.1-rc4 packages to get working kernel modules.</p>									</div>

Are you sure your connection to the serial headers isn&#039;t shorted in some way? I used bare wire that was looped around the pins until I got fed up with them and acquired a set of these (<a href="http://www.diygadget.com/male-to-female-solderless-flexible-jtag-jumper-cable-wires-20-pcs.html">Link</a>). In my case I needed M-F wires but they also sell M-M and F-F.

					<p>Thanks for the replies.&nbsp; The cable is indeed loosely connected to the router.&nbsp; I removed it and still get the unending blinking blue light of failure.&nbsp; I installed wireshark and wasn&#039;t able to see any traffic over eth0.&nbsp; Admittedly, I&#039;ve never used wireshark before, but tcpdump -i eth0 doesn&#039;t show anything either.&nbsp; Continuous pings also result in no reply.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m going to invest in some of those solderless cables, but in the meantime do you think its possible that something somehow shorted and fried the boot code?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hard to say.

					<p>Agree to v.90....<br />In my experience.. I have bricked a router without doing anything that can write to boot loader. Nothing definitely/seriously can explain what happens sometimes. You can only speculate.</p><p>about wireshark test thingie.. I would say you try avoiding windows XP PC, because its LAN bring up time is lower.<br />you power on the router and check for activity from the lan side on the only connected pc. Linux is preferred.</p><p>to detect this packets of life from bootloader from openwrt sometime in some stubborn router you need to try around 10 times <br />one time&nbsp; = power cycle + view on wireshark for packets.</p><p>if you don&#039;t see anything again power cycle.</p><p>if there is&nbsp; boot loader intact, then you can sure recover it 99% of times.</p><p>JTAG is just not possible on Linksys I never really&nbsp; succeed.

					<p>Greetings all. I am back on OpenWRT on my E2100L. The Linksys firmware had become really unstable, presumably due to the level of wireless noise (due to channel saturation) in my apartment building and the device being connected to &#039;the internet&#039;. The problems I was seeing were more than enough motivation to finally do something with this project.</p><p>I finally figured out how to compile this on Amazon EC2. It was well worth the effort. I&#039;m working up the time/motivation to post a how-to or something to the wiki. TBQH the process is very simple and for someone like me who isn&#039;t willing to give up their main CPU for compiling I think a few cents per hour to use EC2 is worthwhile.</p><p>That said, my next phase is to build trunk instead of backfire and see how it runs. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
