					<p>I&#039;m looking at this thread (<a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=61309">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=61309</a>) and it appears that OpenWRT is more or less working with the V11 now.</p><p>I have been trying to use DD-WRT on this device and, while successfully installed and most things are working, I am having a very bizarre problem.</p><p>A single Win7 client (laptop) on my network is experiencing an issue where the active application window will randomly lose focus. I filed a bug with the DD-WRT community here: <a href="http://svn.dd-wrt.com/ticket/5366">http://svn.dd-wrt.com/ticket/5366</a> We did not notice this problem with the stock TP-Link firmware. There are some extra details in the bug report. I also posted on the DD-WRT forum here:</p><p><a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=301743">http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=301743</a></p><p>I&#039;d like to try to install OpenWRT on this device to see if the problem persists.&nbsp; I&#039;d also like to revert to the stock TP-Link firmware if possible to perform yet a different test.</p><p>Can I just upload a BIN for OpenWRT on top DD-WRT via DD-WRT&#039;s GUI upgrade file picker? It appears that the current v11 build is trunk which looks like it means I&#039;d have to subsequently install the GUI?</p>									</div>

					<p>So, I&#039;m reverted to factory WR841ND firmware now using DD-WRT webrevert file.</p><p>At this point I guess it&#039;s just a &quot;vanilla&quot; OE firmware -&gt; OpenWRT.</p><p>Would that still be TFTP? I am comfortable with TFTP, although my guess from some of the docs is that I need to run a TFTP <strong>SERVER</strong> and not just TFTP into the router?</p><p>The device is not bricked or running DD-WRT at this point.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Max,</p><p>I guess I should be more specific --</p><p>I had looked at the wiki and that thread, but I still wanted to be sure.</p><p>The Wiki seems to indicate that a web install is possible:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Installing via web interface:</p><p>Download image for your version.<br />Log in to router web interface and select the firmware image you just uploaded as an update.<br />Sit and wait while it flashes. It will reboot and be accessible at 192.168.1.1.</p></blockquote></div><p>It also sounds like trunk (by default?) does not have the web interface. Is that accurate?</p>									</div>
