					<p>Hello,<br />I&#039;m trying to figure out if is somehow possible to combine Bridged AP/LAN with GuestWifi separated from rest of the network.</p><p>I have main router which serves ip/ipv6/firewall etc. Then I have OpenWrt as AP/LAN switch in lower floor to serve wifi and switch for few lan devices here.</p><p>I&#039;m perfectly capable to set it as bridged AP/LAN to main router of course, but when I&#039;m trying to combine it with guest wifi, which will obtain IP from openwrt I&#039;ll get stuck.<br />I can have functional guestwifi, but lan is not accesible or i have functional lan/ap and guestwifi can&#039;t reach internet.</p><p>I can&#039;t figure how this can be done.</p><p>can someone advise me about that?<br />really appreciated.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kriznik</strong> on 22 Nov 2015, 14:08)</p>

					<p>You need to define two VLANs, with IP interfaces configured, in networks on your router. This will provide and control access.</p><p>Next configure two VLANs on your access point, the guest interface doesn&#039;t need an IP; the guest VLAN will be communicating with a tagged VLAN ID between the two.</p><p>Then bind the guest WiFi SSID to the tagged vlan interface and the other to the untagged (i.e VLAN 1).</p><p>Finally configure firewall rules on your router to allow the communication between subnets that you want. Note that mDNS services like AirPlay will not work across the two networks unless you open the firewall ports and also implement an mDNS reflector.</p><p>Some experimentation and care needed to set up the VLANs as it&#039;s possible to lock yourself out very easily. Also an intermediate switches need to support 802.1q VLANs.</p>									</div>

					<p>J1mbo, would you agree that this article, including the &quot;Multiple network devices&quot; section, covers it?<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan</a></p><p>That part is uber-confusing to me, so I haven&#039;t attempted it yet.

					<p>Yes that is essentially the same configuration as my brief summary.</p><p>There is another way though. You could plug another OpenWRT device into your network, create the Guest SSID on that, and have the *WAN* port of it connected to your LAN. Either use DHCP on it&#039;s WAN interface or configure a static IP on your network (i.e. 192.168.1.10 or whatever) with it&#039;s default gateway being the IP address of your main router.</p><p>Use a different network range for it&#039;s DHCP server (say 192.168.2.0/24, if your current network is 192.168.1.0/24).</p><p>Then add to it some firewall rules to drop traffic from it&#039;s internal network to yours, i.e.</p><p>Source: 192.168.2.0/24<br />Destination: 192.168.1.0/24<br />Action: Drop</p><p>Also configure a interface bandwidth cap if you like eg wshaper.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>J1mbo</strong> on 10 Dec 2015, 00:19)</p>

					<p>Not sure it&#039;s what you&#039;re looking for, but I eventually found that this link (which was actually linked from the page in my last post) does in fact work if followed very carefully. I say &quot;carefully&quot; because the procedure is pretty subtle about one or two steps (it doesn&#039;t show screenshots for absolutely everything).<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan-webinterface">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/gu … binterface</a></p>									</div>

					<p>That tutorial surely works if youre using the wan port. Not My case --&#039;<br />I have a ISP provided router, and use several tp-link wr841N for Wi-Fi Access arround the building.</p><p>I&#039;ve been trying to migrate to openwrt and done so on the wr841 that dont need guest Access, been trying using several tutorials but cannot get the guest Wi-Fi To connect to the internet.

					<p>Tried that one also.</p><p>I have literally tried every tutorial i have seen online...</p><p>I can get the guest WLAN to provide DHCP to the clients, but cannot get the clients to &quot;talk&quot; to the internet.<br />I can ping and access the AP while connected to the Guest Wifi</p><p>ISP Router - 192.168.1.254<br />AP - 192.168.1.2<br />Guest Wifi - 192.168.2.1</p><p>Clients that connect to the guest wifi, get an IP adress in the range 192.168.2.100 to 192.168.2.150<br />The problem is that the AP isnt fowarding any traffic to the main LAN and most of the tutorials assume you&#039;re using the WAN port for internet acess... but it should work if you changed the destination to LAN instead of WAN.</p><p>w w w . steven-england.info/2014/11/01/openwrt-how-to-create-a-public-network-without-using-the-wan-interface</p><p>This guy makes a tutorial for guest wifi with lan, but he says we have to tell the Router about the guest wifi, and in my case i dont have permitions to do that. So for now only DDWRT can acheive this on its own.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Reaching this point you are able to initiate connections to clients of the LAN segment, but clients from LAN can’t connect to ZONE_GUEST, because there is no forwarding rule making this possible. Furthermore you can reach far away destinations like this website BUT: We did not enable NAT on LAN, so packets are routet to my website and unfortunately do not find their way back (router with IP 192.168.2.1 is asking it’s default gateway for a route to network 192.168.4.0/24 what will never be answered). Therefore, if you want to avoid double NAT (of course you want) you have to tell your router a route.</p></blockquote></div><p>EDIT:</p><p>Found this</p><p>forum.turris.cz/t/guest-and-intranet-wifi-configuration/973/13</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Hello pe7erk0,</p><p>I had the same problem. Finally I discovered the reason.<br />When following the recipe you mentioned, the dhcp-server does not advertise a DNS-server to your guest clients.</p><p>You can remedy this in the DHCP-options field for the DHCP-server on the Advanced Settings tab in the LuCi page for your guest network at Network-Interfaces (ht tp://192.168.10.1/cgi-bin/luci/admin/network/network/guest14 in your case).</p><p>Your guests won&#039;t have problems if they manually have set dns-servers for their wifi connection. Maybe that is the reason the author of the recipe did not notice it isn&#039;t working out of the box.</p></blockquote></div><p>Will try this, maybe this is what&#039;s giving problems.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gajotnt</strong> on 27 Dec 2016, 15:57)</p>
