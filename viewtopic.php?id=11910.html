					<p>Suppose you have set a root password, and for whatever reason you wish to continue to use telnet to access the unit rather than being forced to use ssh. Here&#039;s how to do it.</p><p>(1) Download the source from subversion (tested here with Kamikaze 7.07). &#039;make menuconfig&#039; and enable the &#039;login&#039; component of busybox, by selecting Base System -&gt; Busybox Configuration -&gt; Login/Password Management Utilities -&gt; login</p><p>Use &#039;make&#039; to build the firmware image, and then flash it onto your unit. (Or you could just upload the busybox package, but that would waste flash space)</p><p>(2) Modify /etc/init.d/telnet so that it always starts telnetd. It should look like this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common
# Copyright (C) 2006 OpenWrt.org
START=50

start() {
        telnetd -l /bin/login
}

stop() {
        killall telnetd
}</code></pre></div><p>(3) Replace /bin/login with a symlink to busybox</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cd /bin
rm login
ln -s busybox login</code></pre></div><p>That&#039;s it. Note, there is a security problem: you won&#039;t be prompted for a password if you give an invalid username, so it&#039;s very easy for an attacker to probe for valid usernames. But any attacker probably knows that your main login username is &#039;root&#039;; and if you care about security, you&#039;ll probably want to stick with ssh anyway.</p>									</div>

					<p><strong>DANGER:</strong> make sure you set a root password first - or if building a complete image to reflash, include a root password in /etc/passwd.</p><p>Otherwise, you will find yourself completely locked out. Even &quot;Failsafe&quot; mode won&#039;t work; you&#039;ll just get a login prompt which you can&#039;t login at. You will be forced to use whatever TFTP-mode reflashing or recovery disk that your platform provides.</p><p>(The problem here is that in etc/preinit in failsafe mode, it still just runs telnetd -l bin/login. Suggestion to OpenWrt developers: maybe this should be changed to point to a script which is specific to failsafe mode, and won&#039;t be broken if the user compiles login support to busybox)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>candlerb</strong> on 14 Aug 2007, 11:49)</p>
