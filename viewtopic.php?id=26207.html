Is it why you installed a fan? Or is it just due to the HDD ? If you see here below you will see I automatically get 263Mhz. It is not so far your 299 Mhz. Then does it really need an overclocking.

					<p>Dear Opensys,</p><p>I am actually busy to upgrade my WL-500g Premium I functionalities.</p><p>Then I come back to your hacks.</p><p>First of all I though to grow up the number of USB ports.</p><p>Following your hacks (2º hack - internal usb to join a hard 320G d2.5 disk with 2.0 usb to sata adaptor) you just added an USB port for your internal HDD (where I currently use an external USB HDD. Then it can help me). But what about the fourth USB port ? You didn&#039;t exlpain how to get it. Do you have any idea ?</p><p>And for your current third USB port. AS I explained I am not an electronic guy (but I already solder when I was young then I presume I can still do it now ... hihi ...) what about the green capacitor. I means, the dark red cable is solder on a components but I forgot how many foot has a capacitor and how must I solder this capacitor ? I can orientate it as you show us on the picture but I don&#039;t know which arm are soldered on the shown black component. Sorry to be so stupid but a better picture with the base of this green capacitor can help me.<br />In fact if I put it as shown on the picture and can see the base of the capacitor I just need to put it like you and solder it and it will work without knowing anything else in electronic.</p><p>Sincerely thanks for your help and have a nice day.</p><p>Miguipda ;-)</p>									</div>

					<p>Dear Opensys,</p><p>since I did not get some answer to my last question I will repeat it more clearly because I still discovered some difference between your picture usb4 and usb5.</p><p>As I asked the situation of the green capacitor. (A picture from the other side to see the soldering you made can help).<br />I presume one foot of the capacitor is soldered to the brown cable and the other to the black component (left foot) just behind it.<br />But as requested I presume the left foot is soldered to the left foot of the black component that is soldered on the board and the capacitor right foot to the brown cable. Is it right ? About the signs (+ and - of the capacitor if it is important which foot of the capacitor must be soldered to the left foot of the black component soldered on the board ?).</p><p>And finally what is the soldering you made from the L23 C19? just at the right of the white cable ? It is soldered to the top of a component but where does it goes for those two next small soldering ?</p><p>Sincerely thanks if you may help me to make this first hack.</p><p>Have a nice day.</p><p>Miguipda ;-)</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello miguida,</p><p>Sorry about your last post, but i don&#039;t receive any mail alert about it.<br />So i will answer your questions:</p><p>About usb host and pin out connections you must see the via usb host controller VT6212L chip datasheet: <a href="http://www.missingremote.com/legacy/img/stories/hd200/VT6212L.pdf">http://www.missingremote.com/legacy/img … T6212L.pdf</a><br />I sold two 19k smd resistors in usb to gnd to make same pull up resistance, i just copy the resistance in the one of the two usb ports that exists in router.<br />The green electronic capacitor is just connect to the main 5v already existing capacitor,&nbsp; to support the pics from the hard disk. And yes the + and - poles must be right.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>OpenSys</p>									</div>

					<p>Well done. <br />I have couple questions.<br />1)Do you still using standart power supply?(you&#039;ve got built-in HDD, which takes power)<br />2)Was there any overheating problems?(HDD releasing some heat and memory microchips should so)<br />Thanks in advance</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello cybernoid,</p><p>Yes i use a 5V 4AMP transformer.<br />No problems with overheating, i have a fun, and this HDD don&#039;t get very hot, just all normal, with wan adsl bridge, i get up times more then one month.</p><p>OpenSys</p>									</div>

					<p>Dear Opensys,</p><p>here is also a guy who made some modifications to his WL-500g Premium.<br />In the part 2 and 4 he shows how to add an audio USB key to get this router able to play sounds:<br /><a href="http://www.equinoxefr.org/post/tag/wl500g/">http://www.equinoxefr.org/post/tag/wl500g/</a></p><p>Have a nice day, and I feel I will soon hack my same router.<br />I am a little a bit worry about this (I hope I will not destroy it) but I think it could be great to have more functionalities.</p><p>Have a nice day and with pleasure to read you back.</p><p>Miguipda ;-)</p>									</div>

					<p>Short question:<br />Why you didn&#039;t wired hdd power directly to main power?<br />To be honest, I hasve some electronics skills left in me...but I don&#039;t want to wire directly to mother board integrates.<br />My goal is to wire one rack to usb connector.<br />I just want to make from this old retired router a nice low power torrent client (I don&#039;t use the router for anything else...)</p>									</div>

					<p>The usb hdd is connected to 5v directed to router power supply.<br />I what to do it all inside the router, not a cable getting outside the router and connecting again from inside to usb female port.<br />You need a Power supply with 5V 4A to be safe, check the consume of the hard disk and make the math. The big capacitor was to absorbs the voltage pic&#039;s that the disk provoke. If you use a SSD may be better <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Regards</p>									</div>
