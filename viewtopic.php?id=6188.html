Since you have left out WHAT specific P2P app you are using, it&#039;s difficult to say in detail. Above and beyond whether you feel comfortable with iptables or not, you don&#039;t seem to have grasped the basic technology, that in order to be &quot;connectable&quot; from outside you need to have a port forwarded from the WAN to your internal host.</p><p>As an example here&#039;s all I had to add to mine:</p><p>### Port forwarding<br />## -- This forwards port 49152 on the WAN to port 49152 on 10.70.1.21<br />iptables -t nat -A prerouting_rule -i $WAN -p tcp --dport 49152 -j DNAT --to 10.70.1.21:49152<br />iptables&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -A forwarding_rule -i $WAN -p tcp --dport 49152 -d 10.70.1.21 -j ACCEPT</p><p>My internal P2P host is on a fixed IP of course.</p><p>If you don&#039;t want to use the command-line and learn iptables then OpenWRT may not be the best firmware for you.&nbsp; I&#039;m not being rude here just practical, there are other firmware that build on OpenWRT and make it more n00b-friendly.&nbsp; I use DD-WRT in many applications and while not as flexible as OpenWRT it&#039;s got a nice PhD interface. (PhD=Push here Dummy). OpenWRT may catch up on the GUI front eventually but that&#039;s not really it&#039;s focus at this time. A solid and stable OS is.</p><p>Many people use uPNP (retch!) as a solution to this sort of problem. It&#039;s supposed to automagically solve all such problems for you. Well when it works and it&#039;s not breaking something else. I usually just set up my own forwards because I don&#039;t trust uPNP.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 22 Jun 2006, 21:53)</p>

					<p>If you have more&nbsp; than one computer on your network, &quot;Full Cone NAT&quot; is not for you. </p><p>I don&#039;t know why people are making up new terms for NAT techniques.

All we need to know is what ports your application needs directed to your computer and the address of your computer, and all will be well. For that computer. </p><p>Why people write NAT-unfriendly apps in this day and age is beyond me. I mean it&#039;s one thing for a P2P system like bittorrent just plain needing one port and one range forwarded for optimal performance, that&#039;s no big deal.

					<p>I have used bitmetv in the past. Using u-Torrent program, configured to port 49152. BitmeTV is particular about what client software you can use and how you use it. If you do things wrong, they will kick you off their site, they have zero patience. If you don&#039;t keep your ratio up or any of a number of other infractions, they will ban you. It&#039;s not a very friendly site if you are struggling with technology problems.</p><p>With my OpenWRT unit all I had to do was forward port 49152 to the LAN host running u-Torrent.</p><p>The u-Torrent software has an option for testing. Look under Options-&gt;Speed Guide, there is a button to test if your port is forwarded properly.</p><p>Somewhere else in the options is the choice to have the software punch a hole in the Windows XP firewall for port 49152, another step you might have missed.
