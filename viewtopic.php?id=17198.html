					<p>My router is a fonera 2200, and uses dropbear for ssh.</p><p>Basically, I installed dd-wrt a long time ago and used an RSA key to connect via SSH. Since then I reformatted my computer and deleted the key. I decided to install open-wrt. I can access redboot through telnet no problem, but when I try to access through SSH, it wants my old key (which I no longer have). Also, I was able to telnet into open-wrt after installing the first time, now telnet wont connect after I set the password using passwd.</p><p>Is the any way reset the SSH password? (Either through redboot, or telnet in open-wrt). I want to be able to transfer files to my router easily using SCP. Any help would be great, I spent a good many hours searching for an answer, and have tried everything I can think of... Any help would be amazing.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>On a Linux machine using <em>ssh</em>, you just need to edit the <strong>~/.ssh/known_hosts</strong> file to remove the line contains the ssh key for the site in order to be able to re-establish an ssh connection with a new key. On a PUTTY, you will need to read its docs to find out how to remove this key.</p>									</div>
