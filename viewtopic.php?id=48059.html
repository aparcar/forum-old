					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have reinstalled dnsmasq from the Luci System/Software page, and after that it seems that it has stopped working; I cannot see it in the process list (ps command), nor start it with &quot;/etc/init.d/dnsmasq start&quot;. Also, I do not see any active DHCP leases in Luci pages any more.</p><p>If I start dnsmasq with /usr/sbin/dnsmasq, it starts working, but Luci DHCP page is still not displaying active leases (the list is empty), and trying to control the service with /etc/init.d/dnsmasq start/restart/stop is not having any effect, and it seems to be ignoring configuration in /etc/config/dhcp. Does anybody know what did I mess up, and how to fix it?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
