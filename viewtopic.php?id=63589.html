					<p>Hi </p><p>I&#039;ve been experiencing a lot of bu****it within Call of Duty on my games consoles and didn&#039;t think it would be my Â£200 router. In all in all of the tests I tried the router seems to be the culprit. I play on a cable connection and the Linksys router is running OpenWRT 15.00.5 with nothing but QoS and UPnP installed. I have disabled QoS and that makes no difference. What&#039;s noticeably different is the WiFi performance. I run the speedtest.net app on my phone sitting right next to the router and the Linksys router only pushes 68Mbps whereas the BT HH5 can push 75Mbps. It&#039;s not much but you would expect the Linksys router to outperform a free ISP provided router.</p><p>Will</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>willowen100</strong> on 22 Mar 2016, 22:38)</p>

					<p>You should run a test on the OEM firmware for reference; in some cases those drivers perform better than the ones OpenWrt has access to.</p><p>If your numbers are the result of a single measurement, keep in mind they don&#039;t say anything meaningful. It&#039;s a 10% difference between both numbers, I don&#039;t know the specs of your ISP&#039;s router, if the gap is consistent over multiple test runs, then of course there might be a problem.</p>									</div>
