					<p>Hi all! <br />With openwrt faced for the first time, but there was a problem that can not solve on their own. So ... there is a router, ar800 factory firmware (192.168.1.1), he is the main router network, it gives the &#039;Net via Wi-Fi and Lan. To this wire connected two computers (* and * .2 .3, respectively). The neighboring house is tp-link tl-wr841nd with openwrt. Tp-link set up as a bridge connected to the main wifi router. Tp-link network catches the main router sends an Internet on the lan and Wi-Fi. Lan * .50 Statics, Wi-Fi has received an address from the main * .12 for dhcp. For tp-link connected computer (* .55 static) wire, which received the &#039;Net. Now, the problem itself, on PC tp-link does not see computers connected to the main router, or even pinging 192.168.1.1 Tell me how to set up preferably through luci. Thank you in advance.<br />That network diagram:<br /><a href="http://gifok.net/image/fj6L">http://gifok.net/image/fj6L</a></p><p>OR</p><p><a href="http://radikal.ru/fp/4784e8fb3cf84328a7384165971e57a0"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://s019.radikal.ru/i608/1511/0a/2df27bca8b31t.jpg" alt="http://s019.radikal.ru/i608/1511/0a/2df27bca8b31t.jpg" /></span></a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>asd7799977</strong> on 16 Nov 2015, 03:12)</p>

					<p>If I understand correctly, you need to install the Relay. Here&#039;s how to set it up so that the two networks have become one?</p>									</div>
