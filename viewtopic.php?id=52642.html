					<p>Good evening,</p><p>I was wondering if there was currently more I could do to my setup for security sake.&nbsp; I have a Netgear WNR1000v2 router that I had to install OpenWRT on in order to open up UDP port 500 for my work VPN.&nbsp; That worked beautifully once I figured out the whole iptables thing.</p><p>Now that I&#039;m done with OpenWRT, I noticed that there&#039;s no password to telnet 192.168.1.1 - it goes straight to the root@WNR1000v2:/# cursor.&nbsp; This appears to be due to it possibly being in some unsupported list?</p><p>&quot;WNR1000 v1-2: works. Does not require username/password for login. On connection the &#039;#&#039; prompt is displayed.&quot;</p><br /><p> === IMPORTANT ============================<br />&nbsp; Use &#039;passwd&#039; to set your login password<br />&nbsp; this will disable telnet and enable SSH<br />---------------------------------------------------<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Splash Screen)<br />---------------------------------------------------<br />root@WNR1000v2:/# passwd<br />passwd: no record of root in /etc/shadow, using /etc/passwd<br />Changing password for root<br />New password:<br />Retype password:<br />passwd: cannot update password file /etc/passwd<br />root@WNR1000v2:/#<br />root@WNR1000v2:/#</p><br /><p>For those it helps, here&#039;s my mount info:</p><p>root@WNR1000v2:/# mount<br />rootfs on / type rootfs (rw)<br />/dev/root on / type squashfs (ro)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;---(This my problem?)<br />none on /proc type proc (rw,nodiratime)<br />none on /tmp type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev)<br />tmpfs on /dev type tmpfs (rw)<br />root@WNR1000v2:/#<br />root@WNR1000v2:/#</p><br /><p>Anything I can do to password protect this instance for peace of mind?<br />~Jace</p>									</div>

					<p>It looks like you installed a firmware without overlay-fs enabled. In this case, you cannot do persistent changes on your device (including /etc/passwd file).</p><p>Did you build the image yourself?</p>									</div>

					<p>desu is absolutely right, my changes are not persistent.&nbsp; I had originally found an answer on Comcast forums:</p><br /><div class="quotebox"><cite>mxclark wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Re: Setting up VPN with NETGEAR WNR1000v2<br />....<br />07-21-2013 03:07 PM&nbsp; </p><p>I figured this out.&nbsp; &nbsp;Port 500 is blocked in the default firewall and cannot be unblocked from the web interface.&nbsp; This stops ipsec from working.&nbsp; You have to log in to the router via telnet, then disable this iptables rule with the command &quot;iptables -D loc2net 8&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;This unblocks port 500.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then you have to forward data from ports 50, 51, and 500 to your computer using the web interface for port forwarding.</p><p>Look on the web for instructions to telnet to your router at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/telnet.console">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/telnet.console</a>.&nbsp; I had the same router and this now works with the Cisco ipsec vpn.</p></blockquote></div><p>I used his link to OpenWRT and followed the Windows instructions there using Mirror 1.&nbsp; My biggest grief was realizing my UDP 500 was on line 6, not 8.&nbsp; I appreciate the help guys.&nbsp; If you feel it&#039;s a lot of trouble, don&#039;t worry about it.&nbsp; I could always disconnect this ancient equipment and go back to Comcast on my next day off to request a VPN-friendly router.&nbsp; And if my changes aren&#039;t going to remain persistent, I probably should.</p><p>~Jace</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MrJace</strong> on 23 Oct 2014, 19:41)</p>
