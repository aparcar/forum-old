					<p>If you have an OpenWrt router, can&#039;t you just let the router announce itself as DNS server (which it should do by default) and then block your client from connecting to external DNS servers (UDP port 53) completely?

    Do not use AF_UNSPEC.
  - No use of `options edns0` in /etc/resolv.conf since EDNS0 allows
    responses larger than 512 bytes and can lead to valid DNS responses

  - No use of `RES_USE_EDNS0` or `RES_USE_DNSSEC` since they can both

					<p>Please do not limit the size of DNS responses. This was a foolish and irresponsible thing for Red Hat to have recommended for several reasons, the most important of which is that it does not actually protect your systems. The bug relies on being able to force a retry of the DNS request in order to force the heap/stack switch that leads to the buffer overflow. In other words, it&#039;s not just one packet, so limiting single packets doesn&#039;t help. Further, the exploit works just as well over TCP, so limiting the sizes of UDP packets is worse than useless. </p><p>From a protocol standpoint it&#039;s been true for 15 years that DNS answers can be, and nowadays often are, larger than 512 bytes, even on UDP. &quot;New&quot; technologies like EDNS0, DNSSEC, and IPv6 mean that answers will often contain more information than was asked for, even if you&#039;re not actively making use of DNSSEC/IPv6/etc. on your network. Just one common example, the query to list the root name servers (which includes the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of all the servers in the ADDITIONAL section) is 755 bytes. </p><p>So definitely patch your systems for which patches are available, and if you have other devices you are concerned about that aren&#039;t getting updates contact the vendor(s) and demand that they provide one. This is a serious vulnerability, and I don&#039;t want to minimize that. But please don&#039;t make the problem worse by breaking your DNS in the process.</p>									</div>
