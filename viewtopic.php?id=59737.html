					<p>I would like to stop DNS hijacking at the router so I don&#039;t have to worry about software configuration on each device. I&#039;ve tried to find more information about this problem, but I haven&#039;t found much. I did hear 2 names mentioned: Dnsmasq and DNSCrypt.</p><p>From what I&#039;ve read, only DNSCrypt actually uses encryption to protect DNS requests, so it&#039;s the only option I know of that would render an ISP unable to tamper with the requests. I don&#039;t trust my ISP to not hijack my DNS, but I also don&#039;t want to use a VPN for everything. What can I do with OpenWRT?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>withflair</strong> on 18 Sep 2015, 21:34)</p>

					<p>Yes, DNSSEC is the answer. I can&#039;t speak for dnscrypt, but current versions of dnsmasq have been well tested with DNSSEC and OpenWrt to provide full cryptographic protection of all DNS queries and responses.</p><p>The infrastructure to support DNSSEC has been in place since 2010.

					<p>RangerZ, you&#039;re exactly right. I didn&#039;t explain my post as well as I should have. It&#039;s not that I don&#039;t want to use another DNS server like Google&#039;s or OpenDNS&#039;s. I do. But unless the requests to those DNS servers are encrypted, the ISP can intercept the request, pretend to be Google/OpenDNS, then send back fake data.</p><p>If I&#039;m not mistaken, DNSSEC provides authentication and integrity, but not confidentiality: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4033#page-7">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4033#page-7</a></p><p>I believe it uses some kind of digital signature but not encryption. In other words, if you&#039;re using DNSSEC, your ISP won&#039;t be able to tamper with your DNS requests without your knowledge, and you will also be able to tell the response comes from your DNS server of choice rather than from your ISP, but your ISP will still be able to tell which sites you&#039;re visiting just from your DNS requests.</p><p>DNSCrypt, on the other hand, does protect against MITM and spying: <a href="https://www.opendns.com/about/innovations/dnscrypt/">https://www.opendns.com/about/innovations/dnscrypt/</a></p><p>This is why I believe, with my very limited knowledge at the moment, that DNSCrypt may be the best solution, but someone here might know an even better one.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>withflair</strong> on 20 Sep 2015, 06:32)</p>

					<p>Like stangri, I&#039;m also curious to know what happens if there is an attempted MitM. Does the connection simply fail? Does it allow the attack and stay silent?
