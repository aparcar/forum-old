					<p>So, the Windows Server is a domain controller, i suppose...</p><p>As a starting point...<br />Configure all you client devices with static IP-addresses, and<br />Configure the DNS on your OpenWRT to know about all your client devices, and<br />Configure the Windows Server to use OpenWRT as default gateway AND nameserver...</p><p>Now I believe everything will work, except, you will not have DHCP.</p><p>Both Windows and OpenWRT have their combined DHCP/DNS-implementation... but Windows AD may not be so happy to rely on OpenWRT for DHCP/DNS... and Windows may also not be so happy to serve the non-AD-clients... dont know exactly. I try to know as little as possible about Windows Server.</p>									</div>
