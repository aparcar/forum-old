					<p>I have installed OpenWRT 8.09.1 onto a WRT54G at a client&#039;s place of business primarily in order to profile their connection. Specifically I am interested in what their peak bandwidth usage is -- that is how often and for how long they are maxing out their ADSL connection.</p><p>I installed and got vnstat working which is good but still doesn&#039;t give me the &quot;peak&quot; information I am looking for.</p><p>Is there an alternative utility I can use to do this?</p><p>thanks -- Rob</p>									</div>
