					<p>Hello</p><p>A user reports having successfully installed OpenWrt on the Planex MZK-W04NU, and then compiled and ran Freeswitch (one of the open-source competitors to the Asterisk IP PBX software).</p><p>The Planex likes a neat solution to provide SOHO users/small businesses with a compact PBX.</p><p>If some of you succesfully use this hardware + OpenWrt + Freeswitch, I&#039;d like some feedback. I prefer to run Freeswitch instead of Asterisk because FS is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac, hence a more flexible option, business-wise.</p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>

The only problem I had encountered with FS running on a mediocre FON2100 unit is it eats up more CPU resources than Asterisk. This makes it almost impossible to handle calls.</p>									</div>

					<p>Mmm... :-/ Does someone know what processor the Fon uses, and whether the Planex is faster?</p>									</div>
