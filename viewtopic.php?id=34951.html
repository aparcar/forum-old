					<p>I apologize if this is posted in the wrong forum, but I couldn&#039;t figure out where it should go.&nbsp; Feel free to move this post mods.</p><p>The short version:<br />I live in Norway, but want to use a VPN to watch country-restricted TV shows.&nbsp; I would like to turn the VPN on at the router level so that all of my devices can run through the VPN.&nbsp; From what I&#039;ve read, my best bet seems to be flashing a router with firmware that supports VPN.&nbsp; However, my current router, a D-link DIR-615 version B2, seems incapable of running DD-WRT or OpenWRT.&nbsp; Thus, I probably need to buy a new router.</p><p>Three basic questions:<br />1. What router should I buy?&nbsp; I essentially want to use it to stream HD tv shows.&nbsp; We have several devices, but a basic home setup.&nbsp; My choices for routers are fairly limited as Norway is a very small market.&nbsp; This page offers the best selection in the country though: <a href="http://www.komplett.no/k/kl.aspx?bn=10282">http://www.komplett.no/k/kl.aspx?bn=10282</a></p><p>2. Will either OpenWRT or DD-WRT work better for what my intended use will be?&nbsp; In reading about both, that doesn&#039;t seem to be the case.</p><p>3. How much learning how to program in linux will choosing OpenWRT require?&nbsp; Ideally, I would prefer a 30 minutes or less, follow easy steps, and you&#039;re done type solution.&nbsp; I like how open and diverse the development community is here (in comparison to DD-WRT), but I&#039;m worried that this diversity might leave me with an incomplete solution for my new router.</p><p>So, all that being said, does anyone have any advice for me?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi WFU03,</p><br /><p>1. Choose a decent OpenWRT supported router with enough horsepower for heavy streaming. I would highly recommend you WNDR3700v2 (<a href="http://www.komplett.no/k/ki.aspx?sku=492607">http://www.komplett.no/k/ki.aspx?sku=492607</a>). It is not clear from the description on the website if the router is v1 or v2. But even if it is v1, it comes with 8MB flash which is OK (v2 has 16MB flash). The other important features are the same - 64MB RAM, 680 MHz CPU, dual band WiFi radio.</p><p>2. OpenWRT has matured great in last years and you can use its LuCI web interface to do most of the settings you might ever need. But even if you need to tweak something from the command interface, that is not rocket science <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>3. You don&#039;t have to be a programmer to configure and use OpenWRT <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> Basic knowledge of Linux will be of great help, but even if you don&#039;t feel like having strong Linux skills, it is not that hard at all. There are a lot of howtos here in the forum to get you up and running quickly.</p><p>I hope this helps.</p><br /><p>Cheers,<br />zn</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, my router showed up and I&#039;m having massive problems even getting it to work with the default firmware.&nbsp; </p><p>Essentially, I can get it connected and set up just fine, but I can&#039;t access the internet at all.&nbsp; From posting on a tech support forum, it seems like the problem is that I have an ADSL modem that is also serving as a router.&nbsp; I can&#039;t seem to figure out a way to get it to work in bridge mode.</p><p>Is there any way around this?&nbsp; If I install openwrt on the router, would it possible to have it run a vpn even if the modem is serving as a router as well?&nbsp; </p><p>Basically, I&#039;m just getting frustrated now, but if it isn&#039;t necessary to get the Netgear firmware to play nicely, then I&#039;ll give up on that step.&nbsp; I just figured it would make sense to test if the router worked properly before I messed around with openwrt.</p>									</div>

If you are using any 3G / 4G connection, perhaps you may be interested in some PogoPlug Linux embedded system that runs on a Kirkwood Marvell chip set that has a built-in cryptography chip. In this case, you use one of the USB to connect to the 3G / 4G USB dongle as your WAN and connect an n-port gIGE switch to its single gIGE port.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have openWrt running on many devices, but personally I found it easiest to set up vpn on dd-Wrt for a pptp connection.&nbsp; I used an Asus WL520gU.&nbsp; For anything else I would use openWrt.&nbsp; I have struggled every time I tried to use openVPN.</p><p>The WL520gU has a wired connection to my gateway router.&nbsp; Any device which connects wirelessly to the WL520gU is automatically connected to VPN and appears to servers to be located in San Francisco.</p>									</div>

					<p>Alright, I figured out my modem problems.&nbsp; The ISP had loaded their own version of firmware on it, which took away bridge mode.&nbsp; Once I downloaded new firmware and loaded it on there, I was then able to get my WNDR3700v2 on the internet.&nbsp; At that point, I downloaded and installed OpenWRT.</p><p>After having used OpenWRT for a week or so now, I have to say that it works flawlessly.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been tremendously impressed.&nbsp; </p><p>The only problem is that I can not get the VPN setup to work in OpenWRT.&nbsp; I have tried both PPTP and OpenVPN and I&#039;m hopelessly lost in trying.&nbsp; Apparently if you change a few screens on me (from the DD-WRT ones in the pictures), I can&#039;t follow it.&nbsp; Before trying to get the VPN working, I considered myself smart. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Assuming I want to do PPTP (because it seems slightly easier), would any kind soul be willing to try to walk me through this tutorial applied to OpenWRT? <a href="http://wiki.hidemyass.com/DD-WRT_PPTP_Setup">http://wiki.hidemyass.com/DD-WRT_PPTP_Setup</a></p><p>My current setup is as follows:<br />DSL--&gt;modem (in bridge mode)--&gt;Dlink dir-615 (in PPPoE with login details...base dlink firmware)--&gt;Netgear WNDR3700v2(in DHCP...Backfire 10.03.1 firmware).</p><p>Ideally, I want the dlink router to have a normal connection to the internet and the netgear to always connect to the VPN.&nbsp; That way, if I want a Norwegian IP address I can connect to the dlink and if I want a non-Norwegian one, I can connect to the Netgear.&nbsp; Currently, I get normal internet access on either the dlink or the netgear.</p>									</div>

					<p>With DD-WRT you use the web interface to set up PPTP.&nbsp; That worked for me for an arrangement similar to yours, with a separate router as gateway.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if there is a similar way to set up VPN using LUCI under openWrt.&nbsp; DD-WRT is tailored for the relatively few things which it does--openWrt is much more wide open.&nbsp; That means greater flexibility, but more complications.</p>									</div>

					<p>Perhaps I should just flash my router with DD-WRT.&nbsp; Apparently it is less stable and more likely to cause problems than OpenWRT, but at least then I would have a hope of getting it to work.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried to read and follow the PPTP documentation here, but I can&#039;t seem to get it to work.</p>									</div>
