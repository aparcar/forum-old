					<p>Hi experts,</p><p>I am the happy owner of a freshly bought D-Link DIR-825. After playing around a little bit I was able to install OpenWrt on my new device. Installing <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-dir-825-b1-squashfs-backup-loader.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … loader.bin</a> as described at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-825">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-825</a> was not possible for me, but <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-dir-825-b1-squashfs-backup-loader.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … loader.bin</a> works fine.</p><p>I am running my D-Link DIR-825 behind an AVM FRITZ!Box Fon WLAN 7170:</p><p>The FRITZ!Box is connected to LAN 1 and my PC to LAN 2. In LuCI I have modified the settings at the Essentials section. I have set in Network/Local Network the static IP 192.168.27.2 with Netmask 255.255.255.0. In Network/DHCP I have disabled DHCP since the FRITZ!Box is providing a DHCP server.</p><p>So far everything works fine. I am able to surf in the internet from my PC ...</p><p>Now I would like to improve it, I would like to use the WAN port as an 5th LAN port. I this possible? What I have to configure in LuCI?</p><p>Thanks in advance, Thomas</p>									</div>

					<p>Not sure how to do this with luci, but if you edit the file /etc/config/network, do the following:</p><br /><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1) Find the &quot;config interface wan&quot; section.&nbsp; Comment the entire section out (or delete it).</p><br /><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2) Find the &quot;config interface lan&quot; section.&nbsp; Change the line that says:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname eth0</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; To:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &quot;eth0 eth1&quot;</p><br /><p>Then reboot.&nbsp; This will add eth1 (which is usually the wan port) to the br-lan bridge so it&#039;s bridged with the other 4 lan ports (and with the wireless).</p>									</div>
