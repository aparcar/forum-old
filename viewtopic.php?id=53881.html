					<p>Greetings,<br />I have 2&nbsp; tp link routers running openwrt. (it works great! ar71xx firmware) The first router is running AA, the second BB.<br />I want to have the first router connect to WAN and then split the connection to 2 sub networks.<br />The first sub network would go to the 2nd router. The second sub network would&nbsp; go to a server.<br />First question, do any of you know of a basic or detailed howto for this sort of network setup? <br />Second, is connecting the 2nd router to the first one bridging (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/bridgedclient">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/bridgedclient</a>)<br />The wiki indicates this is not possible with all hardware and that you can use a routed client setup, but I am not sure if what I am trying to do is bridging.</p>									</div>
