					<p>Hello </p><p>I have been reading all of the posts about DG834 on here and all over the web in regards to flashing OpenWrt on it, though I have now reached a road block. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>This is the steps I have taken in an attempt to flash OpenWrt:</p><p>1. Patch bootloader and load it dd if=mtd2-patched.bin of=/dev/mtdblock/2</p><p>2. echo &quot;my_ipaddress 192.168.0.1&quot; &gt; /proc/sys/dev/adam2/environment</p><p>3. Pulled the power out and it rebooted fine</p><p>4. svn co svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/tags/8.09.2</p><p>5. make menuconfig - loading either of <a href="http://www.praguespringpeople.net/Software/OpenWRT%20on%20NetGear%20DG834G%20v2/config-openwrt-on-netgear-dg834g.txt">this</a> and <a href="http://www.praguespringpeople.net/Software/OpenWRT%20on%20NetGear%20DG834G%20v2/openwrt-svn-r14849-ar7-config.txt">this</a> as .config</p><p>6. Installed a <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/raw-attachment/ticket/3782/900-cpmac_init_hack.patch">ethernet patch for AR7</a> (which is for a DG834 v3)</p><p>7. make V=99</p><p>8. dd if=openwrt-ar7-squashfs.bin of=mtd1.bin bs=1 count=720896 and dd if=openwrt-ar7-squashfs.bin of=mtd0.bin bs=1 skip=72089</p><p>9. On the router cd /tmp/ then wget the mtd0.bin mtd1.bin from a PC running httpd</p><p>10. Then dd if=/tmp/mtd1.bin of=/dev/mtdblock/1 and dd if=/tmp/mtd0.bin of=/dev/mtdblock/0</p><p>11. Pull the power out and now it is not responding to PING</p><p>The lights are not flashing in an alternative state and when pinging the router the port light on the router which the pc is connected to that&#039;s issuing the ping command is flashing so maybe some packets are getting sent there but not replying back?</p><p>I have made sure that the IP is the same as the one in .config because if I try and ping any other IP address it gives a &quot;no route&quot; or something different. </p><p>Could it be that I applied that ethernet patch or that I used a config file which was initially used on a older build of Kamikaze? </p><p>Any ideas would be appreciated it. Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zuma</strong> on 14 Jan 2011, 17:37)</p>
