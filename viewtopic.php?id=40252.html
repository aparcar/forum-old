					<p>Hi Guys and thank you for your help in advance. </p><p>Here is my situation: </p><p>Product: Linksys WRT54G V2 </p><p>1. It boots fine. <br />2. I can ping. <br />3. Reset switch appears to work. <br />4. Tried all hard reset methods. <br />5. SSID is now at linksysxx</p><p>I am trying to load OpenWRT firmware via tftp, but it asks for a password. I have not tried serial or jtag yet. </p><p>I can get to the login page, but every known combination of username &amp; password; username &amp; no password; no username &amp; password does not give me access. </p><p>I will try any suggestions.</p>									</div>

					<p>A few questions:<br />1. is the router actually running openwrt at this moment?<br />1a. if it is, did you telnet into it and set a password (passwd)<br />1b. if it isn&#039;t, then it isn&#039;t an openwrt issue, and you may get better answers from a dedicated WRT54G board.<br />2. if it still has lynksys FW, then have you tried via the web interface: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt54g">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt54g</a><br />3. there is an issue with macs (maybe&nbsp; others): see troubleshooting here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.flashing.tftp">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.flashing.tftp</a></p>									</div>

					<p>I have no idea as to what firmware is currently loaded. I bought it on an auction site as is.&nbsp; I assume Openwrt is on it.</p>									</div>
