					<p>Hey everyone,</p><p>Let me start by saying that I am a networking newbie. I&#039;ve tried to search the wiki, but I could not find how to achieve my preferred setup:</p><p>[img]i.imgur.com/6GPlxKW.png[/img]</p><p>So basically, I live in a shared house with a common network. I would like to set up my own private subnetwork with my own AP. I don&#039;t need to have access to the nodes on the common network, but I would like to be able to connect to the internet. </p><p>How can I achieve this?</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>

					<p>This is very simple you just route back through the main router rather than having a direct link to the Internet.</p><p>Default configuration.<br />Change LAN IP address to 192.168.4.1<br />Set up a wifi AP<br />Run Ethernet cable from your WAN port to the main router/modem.</p><p>You should now see on the summary status page that IPv4 WAN has obtained a 192.168.1.x address.&nbsp; Connect your computer or phone to your AP and you have access to the Internet.</p><p>In this basic configuration you can still access your housemates&#039; devices if you know their IP address, but they cannot see anything on your network.</p>									</div>
