					<p>I bought the wrt54gl router a long time ago, believing it would be perfect for openwrt.</p><p>Unfortunately: the hardware is a piece of crap. I&#039;ve had nothing but problems with it for the past few years.</p><p>It&#039;ll even lock up if you&#039;re downloading &quot;too much&quot;.</p><p>My biggest problem is now: I can&#039;t download anything TO the router.<br />I want to upgrade my backfire-rc4 to the latest one (hoping it&#039;ll fix the broken wifi) but as soon as the file has been downloaded the router freezes and reboots.</p><p>So what is your opinion on these problems? Should I just throw it out and get some decent router?</p>									</div>

					<p>I had used Linksys WRT54GS v3 with both DD-WRT and some self-built OpenWRT SVN trunk firmware for a number of years without such an issue. Perhaps, your WRT54GL has a limited RAM (8M?).</p>									</div>
