I was simply offering an explanation as to why you are seeing what you are seeing. Certainly don&#039;t know how you take that as hubris, but whatever. You&#039;re right, the most likely explanation is a bug in permission rights in Ubuntu. Your post regarding root:root was yesterday. I see no post subsequent that states you changed that ownership, but if you have I guess I should have known. My apologizes for weighing and trying to assist.</p>									</div>

This means the switch needs to have CPU port 6 in VLAN 1 (LAN) and CPU port 5 in VLAN 2 (WAN).</p><p>If you are interested in building your own, you can add this patch:</p><p><a href="http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/560773/">http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/560773/</a></p><p>this&#039;ll configure the switch on those models by default. It&#039;ll create this configuration automatically.</p></blockquote></div><p>Many thanks: it works!!!</p>									</div>
