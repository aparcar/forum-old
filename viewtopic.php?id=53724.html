					<p>I&#039;m in the security field and I travel a lot. I don&#039;t trust hotel networks to be either secure or private, so I wanted something portable and easy to use to help with both privacy and security. So I make a portable privacy router using:<br /></p><ul><li><p>TP-Link TL-WR710N</p></li><li><p>OpenWrt BarrierBreaker 14.07</p></li><li><p>OpenVPN</p></li><li><p>anonymous vpn service</p></li></ul><p>The full set of instructions are at <a href="http://www.digitalreplica.org/2014/10/pocket-internet-privacy-shield/">http://www.digitalreplica.org/2014/10/p â€¦ cy-shield/</a> but here&#039;s the highlights of what it does.</p><p>The TL-WR710N is cheap and tiny, but it has two ethernet jacks and a wireless chipset that can do client mode and AP mode at the same time. So I have a wired and wireless connection on both the external and internal side of the firewall to allow for whatever network type is needed. Obviously the firewall is set to block everything incoming from the external side and allow internal traffic out.</p><p>I use the reset button to start and stop the vpn (and reset if you hold it long enough). The vpn start/stop scripts change the LED to blink different patterns depending on when the vpn is connected or not. This lets you connect to the hotel network at first to get through their captive portal pages, then connect the vpn and stay private. For most setups, it&#039;s that easy to use. Only connecting to a new hotel wireless network requires accessing the OpenWRT web interface.</p><p>I hope the instructions are useful to someone else. I tried to make them easy enough that anyone can follow along and get something similar set up. Feel free to post comments either here or directly on the site.</p><p>Danny</p>									</div>

					<p>Sounds a bit tedious if you ask me, why not just use your home router equipped with OpenVPN and connect to that (while it still is at home of course, just to be clear). That is how I did it when I was in the States on vacation and my Router is in the Netherlands, worked perfectly fine and you also get to use your shares safely for back-upping <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> without the need of buying this router and paying for a VPN service.</p>									</div>

					<p>There&#039;s absolutely no reason you couldn&#039;t use this with your own vpn server and save a few bucks. I wouldn&#039;t recommend it, unless you&#039;re comfortable dealing with Internet-exposed services and can make sure you secure it properly. There&#039;s other considerations too.</p><ul><li><p>A vpn on one device is way easier than getting the vpn connected on a couple of laptops, a phone and a tablet. Sometimes I have a couple more devices that may or may not support OpenVPN at all.</p></li><li><p>My home upload speed is crap, so using it would slow down my Internet connection considerably. </p></li><li><p>I have a mix of work and personal devices, and I won&#039;t allow a work machine vpn access to my house</p></li></ul><br /><p>Past that, it was just a fun little geeky project to work on. It let me experiment more with OpenWRT without the risk of screwing up my main Internet router.</p><p>Danny</p>									</div>

I&#039;d say the commercial services are a far more cost-effective choice.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>anonym00se</strong> on 28 May 2015, 06:02)</p>

					<p>Hi, <br />on the 4MB version, I managed to install Attitude Adjustment with openvpn and lucy. (I did not succed with Barrier Breaker, not enough room)</p><p>I did dirty modifications on the wr703n profile (to change the name), and build the image with imagebuilder.</p><p>But I lost the second lan.
