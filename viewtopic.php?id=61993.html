					<p>Hey All,</p><p>I started having issues flashing new PicostationM2HPs with openwrt. I keep getting a &quot;error on server : firmware check failed&quot;, and this seems to happen with Chaos Calmer 15.05, Barrier Breaker 14.07, Attitude Adjustment 12.09 and even an older version of airOS. I was able to get the picos flashed with airOS 5.6.3 but that doesn&#039;t help me. </p><p>So...I was able to pull the board out and console in and do a &quot;urescue&quot; and then tftp my custom openwrt build with no issues. It&#039;s quite possible I have around 200 Picos that might have this same issue. I&#039;ve never seen this before and my company has flashed over a couple thousand of these devices. Is it possible something changed on these boards? What exactly is &quot;urescue&quot; and why is my openwrt build working after doing this.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>This is resolved now. The bootloader was updated on the newer picos and I had to downgrade the bootloader.</p>									</div>
