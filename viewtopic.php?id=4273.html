Both pages mentioned, that a plain l2tp deamon in version 0.69 does not work.

					<p>See <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=4881">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=4881</a> for a patch to RC5 to make l2tpd over IPSEC work.</p><p>(I have l2tpd as a client to a Cisco IOS router, rather than l2tpd as a server to which a Pocket PC client connects, but if one works I think the other should. I am using PSK for now.)</p>									</div>

					<p>I would think that if IPSec + L2TP worked for a Windows XP box, it would work for a Pocket PC.&nbsp; I&#039;ve posted my instructions on how to get IPSec + L2TP using Pre-Shared Keys (PSK) working to <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=4881">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=4881</a>.&nbsp; If you try this, I would love to know if it worked for you.</p>									</div>

					<p>I &#039;m trying to do the same thing. OpenWRT with OpenSwan and L2tpD in order to supply an endpoint for my pocketpc. Did it work out now for you, ALuedtke?</p>									</div>
