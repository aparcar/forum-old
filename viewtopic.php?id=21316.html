					<p>ok so i flashed it with the bin file [openwrt-wrt150n-2.4-squashfs.bin]</p><p>and now the router WORKS EXCEPT WIFI. I cannot even log on to its ip page. The page says 404-not found. I have pinged it and i can assure you the address is right (did ipconfig /all and arp -a). I have Hard reset router without any luck and i have also used a different computer, unplugged all connections form it as well. I cannot reach the login screen as i would be able to form before because its no longer exists. I have pinged the router and i do get a response (64ms).</p><p>I tried TFTP and it fails. I did it over 100 times (tried it right after i disconnect power and reconnect)</p><p>I can SSH to it though and my question is can i upgrade firmware(revert to original) through SSH or telnet? Im not familiar with those methods.I&#039;m using Windows vista.</p><p>ANy help would be appreciated. I did buy a jtag cable but its not here yet and id like to avoid that until thats my last option</p>									</div>
