					<p>* For Wifi N:<br />Throughput is not only depending on how close they stand together, but how good both stand in the radio waves of the others (antenna direction, etc.). Other disturbing WLANs from your neighbours can be a factor too.<br />Additionally software drivers and hardware performance of the PC can also be a factor.</p><p>I suggest, as WLAN is not a cable (which I prefer): if you get a much higher throughput in N mode than in G mode, just be happy. (just my two euro cents)</p><p>* For luci you have to install several packages:<br />luci-admin-mini (always)<br />luci-admin-full<br />luci-theme-openwrt (you can later change to another theme)</p><p>For additional functions there are &quot;luci-app-...&quot; packages.<br />Use &quot;opkg update&quot; (only once), then &quot;opkg list | grep luci&quot; to see all available luci packages.</p><br /><p>Btw:<br />nbd already updated mac80211 and hostapd again <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>maddes.b</strong> on 23 Jan 2010, 17:35)</p>

					<p>Hy, i have a wrt350n v2.1 from linksys which is bricked, i searched and searched for a method to debrick it ,but i didn&#039;t managed to find one, which could explain step by step what to do, i&#039;m searching for 5 day&#039;s now, i read a lot of post&#039;s, tried a lot of methods but my router is still bricked, could someone help me with a good tutorial on how to get it de-bricked, i would pretty much appreciate it, and i&#039;m willing to make a donation if it is necessary. So i&#039;m asking nicely, please help me get it de-bricked. I have a Jtag cable which manages to identify my processor to Marvell Feroceon 88F5181 but it doesn&#039;t recognizes my flash chip. for now i used EJTAG Debrick Utility&nbsp; v3.0.1 with a standard Jtag 20 pin to lpt cable soldered directly to my router board. i Have 3 PC&#039;s , one with Ubuntu 9.04, one with Win XP, and one with Win 7. all of them have lpt 25 pin connector. Please HELP, i&#039;m desperate</p>									</div>
