					<p>Hey all,</p><p>I have had an Ubiquiti RouterStation Pro for several years now and it is running 10.03.1 openwrt code and I think it is time for me to upgrade, but since it has been so long since I set this up I cannot remember which build I used and not sure where to locate it either. I have seen the wiki tutorials on how to do the upgrade but to be honest I am scared to brick this as it is my inet connection.</p><p>Any help would be tremendous.</p><p>EDIT:<br />I see in my kernel logs Atheros AR7161 rev 2 so looks like I need Alteros AR71xx but then not sure about the next step.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pamiller3</strong> on 7 Jun 2016, 06:32)</p>
