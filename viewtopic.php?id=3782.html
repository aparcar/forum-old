					<p>i got HDD 2.5 that had installed custom&nbsp; firmware from <a href="http://wl500g.dyndns.org/1.9.2.7-5a/">http://wl500g.dyndns.org/1.9.2.7-5a/</a>&nbsp; and extra 60BG harddrive.<br />First i installed openwrt experimental package, but after restarting could not get any ssh or telnet port open. Removed harddrive, tried to flash whiterussian - did not help. Then re-flashed original asus firmware, re-flashed whiterussian binary again, but still only tftp port is open.</p>									</div>

					<p>I recently installed WhiteRussion RC4 on a WL-HDD. My path of install was:<br />a) web i/f firmware upgrade from stock ASUS to Oleg&#039;s latest<br />b) web i/f firmware upgrade from Oleg&#039;s to WR RC4</p><p>This was all done without a HDD installed in the device. I found that the model-detection was faulty, and had to override it by setting an NVRAM variable to specify the device type (think it was boardtype=WLHDD from memory).</p><p>I then mounted an IDE drive in it, and after a bit of Googling here found out that I needed to install kmod-ide. You then need to update /etc/modules to load the drivers for the IDE chipset, see <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=1416&amp;p=1">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=1416&amp;p=1</a>.</p><p>Hope this helps,</p><p>Sigurd</p>									</div>

					<p>hm, problem was probably iptables dropping all, strange was that i could not telnet to it, after some time i tried again - and whoop! telnet was working. so i flushed the firewall and is ok.</p>									</div>
