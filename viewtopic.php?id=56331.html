					<p>I&#039;ll +1 to using OpenVPN.&nbsp; Much more suited to this application and just as easy (if not easier) to set up and also more flexible if you want to pass things like UDP traffic as well.</p>									</div>

					<p>I also use OpenVPN for this purpose. Works nicely in Android and iOS (with separate app).<br />My working configurations can be found here:<br /><a href="http://techfindings.one/archives/1837">http://techfindings.one/archives/1837</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zo0ok</strong> on 27 Sep 2015, 17:24)</p>
