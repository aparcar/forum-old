					<p>A broadcast isn&#039;t just an IP address, it&#039;s MAC address FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF as well.

					<p>why dont you test it?<br />set start 254 and limit 10 see how it goes.. you could test on another device.. or virtualbox.. with 2 machines..<br />check if the machine pulling ..2.0 gas the gateway .1.1;<br />you can also force dns and gatway inside general settings..</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, 192.168.0.255 is an special address on a 192.168.0.0/24 network; but on a 192.168.0.0/16 network it is just another perfectly valid address.
