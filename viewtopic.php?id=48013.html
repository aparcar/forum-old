					<p>Hey there.</p><p>I don&#039;t get your question. What do you mean by &quot;kill connections&quot;?</p><p>The RT Graph should shouw maybe thousands of &quot;open connections&quot;, which might be just &quot;TCP connection that has not been closed yet by one side&quot;. That doesn&#039;t necessarily mean there is traffic going on.<br />So, what&#039;s &quot;killing&quot; in this context? Should the router &quot;in behalf of one side&quot; send a &quot;Connection Close&quot; to the other side?</p><p>If you just want to drop some packages (&quot;kick ongoing traffic&quot;), what should make both connection participants hinder from treating this as termporary connection issue and retry?</p><p>Or would you like to dynamically add firewall rules to completely block those kind of connections?<br />Well, yea. An interface for that would be pretty nice. Have the &quot;ongoing connections&quot; list at hand, click on one, which results in a temporary iptables rule that denies exactly those &quot;from ip+port to ip+port protocol&quot; and initiates an &quot;at&quot; job that clears this iptables rule after a couple of minutes.</p><p>That would be a really nice idea. But I really doubt something like that is implemented yet <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>									</div>

(read hard to implement..if it wasnt till now)<br />no, all i want to do is just CLI list and kill a connection, or if you prefer inside RT Graph&gt; connections.. a button with DROP on it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />; at the moment i find it usefull in case of those wayyyy, weyyy to long skype connections.. if you know what i mean <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />; i also find interesting the fact that none has thought at killing random connections.. besides iptables ACCEPT DROP REJECT, i&#039;ve looked and didn&#039;t sow any package dealing with that </p><p>cheers</p><p>edit: heh seems there is no way to kill connections passing trough the router besides refresh wan ip and manually disconnecting UTP cable..</p><p>edit2: i found a broad sollution.. cutting off the ip at specified hours, clues from this post<br /><a href="http://whirlysworld.blogspot.ro/2013/08/blocking-internet-at-specific-times.html">http://whirlysworld.blogspot.ro/2013/08 â€¦ times.html</a></p><p>nano /etc/firewall.user or network&gt;firewall&gt;customrulles and restart firewall after<br />iptables -I INPUT -m time --timestart 00:00 --timestop 07:00 -m mac --mac-source xx:xx:xx:xx -j DROP<br />iptables -I FORWARD -m time --timestart 00:00 --timestop 07:00 -m mac --mac-source xx:xx:xx:xx -j DROP</p><p>ps: timestart is start of rule</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makarel</strong> on 20 Jan 2014, 01:25)</p>
