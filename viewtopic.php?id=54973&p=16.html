					<p>Seems the merge into main will take a while..<br />So I made a new build for my c2600.

					<p>Thanks Merc6.9 for your build, very clean and slim. A lot less to get rid of especially when using the router simply as an Access Point like I do.</p><p>However, I had to rollback to: <a href="http://luci.subsignal.org/~trondah/c2600/r49166/">http://luci.subsignal.org/~trondah/c2600/r49166/</a> because of 2 major reasons:</p><p>On first update, only 2.4ghz was available, 5ghz would not work and settings were not possible (nothing in the dropdown menus). I factory resetted and then 2.4ghz was gone, couldn&#039;t even see it but 5ghz was there but even though I was able to configure it, I couldn&#039;t see it with my devices.</p><p>The other problem (reported by someone else as well earlier) was the transmit power. I couldn&#039;t go over 23dbm. I tried Canada, US, 00-World, nothing worked. I also tried a few other channels and I was still stuck at 23dbm (199mw). I don&#039;t know why but this used to be 30dbm (1000mw) with arokh&#039;s builds and it worked well. Also, after playing with the countries, the transmit power was even stuck lower at 20dbm (100mw) at some point and I couldn&#039;t find a way to bring it back to 23dbm.</p><p>I have a version 1.1 and no console, sorry. Btw, when I installed your version (sysupgrade as I was already running OpenWRT), I upgraded from <a href="http://luci.subsignal.org/~trondah/c2600/r49005/,">http://luci.subsignal.org/~trondah/c2600/r49005/,</a> not from stock.</p><p>Also, the reboot problem was still there, ie: issuing a reboot command would make the device unresponsive but it would not reboot.</p><p>For those interested, usually when I install arokh&#039;s build, here&#039;s the first thing I do to clean it up:</p><p>opkg --force-removal-of-dependent-packages remove tor strongswan transmission-daemon ppp ppp-mod-pppoe odhcpd miniupnpd iptables ip6tables dnsmasq-full firewall ddns-scripts openvpn openvpn-openssl dnscrypt-proxy odhcp6c</p><p>You need to run this twice to get rid of dependencies that were not removed the first time. Like I said, I run this device as an access point, not a router, that&#039;s why I do not need stuff like iptables, dnsmasq, etc, etc...</p><p>I then delete all the following interfaces: TOR Wifi, OVPNTCP, OVPNUDP, TOR, WAN, WAN6, USB and finish configuring my LAN and set a default gateway that points to my pfSense router.</p><p>I really look forward to a super clean, very trimmed down image I could use but I don&#039;t mind using arokh&#039;s builds for now, they are very easy to clean up and are very stable so far.</p><p>The only things that are still a problem with those build is the non-working reboot and a lot of continuous messages like this but they so far don&#039;t create any issue it seems:</p><p>Tue Apr 26 23:11:01 2016 kern.warn kernel: [ 1074.451255] ath10k_pci 0001:01:00.0: Unknown eventid: 36898<br />Tue Apr 26 23:23:08 2016 kern.warn kernel: [ 1800.803483] ath10k_pci 0001:01:00.0: Unknown eventid: 36898<br />Tue Apr 26 23:23:10 2016 kern.warn kernel: [ 1802.866982] ath10k_pci 0001:01:00.0: Unknown eventid: 36898<br />Tue Apr 26 23:23:48 2016 kern.warn kernel: [ 1840.764646] ath10k_pci 0001:01:00.0: Unknown eventid: 36898<br />Tue Apr 26 23:27:46 2016 kern.warn kernel: [ 2079.374736] ath10k_pci 0000:01:00.0: Unknown eventid: 36898</p><p>Thanks guys for all the work you&#039;re doing to properly support this device. It is worth it and very much appreciated.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>RedVortex</strong> on 27 Apr 2016, 06:35)</p>

					<p>Probably the remaining issues with the wifi MAC addresses and also the not-fully-reliable initialization of wifi on first boot can be solved by merging with the improved handling of the ath10k calibration data that @ianchi is working on for the EA8500.</p><p>I had hoped to have at least the initial c2600 support merged into trunk before doing that, since otherwise this becomes a moving target.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>ianchi wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I started using tha same method to extract caldata.<br />And it also worked for extraction in EA8500.<br />But the problem I found was when you tried to change the MAC address as that method doesn&#039;t recalculate the checksum for the new data accordingly. Then on boot the driver would complain and ended with a crash.<br />Thus the new package, it adds the checksum recalc.</p><p>Today I corrected the place where the script was being called, as previously it was called after the driver loaded, so on first boot it didn&#039;t have caldata and so no wifi (on reboot it had the files from previous boot, so eventually it worked).</p><p>What specific problem are you having with wifi MAC address?

					<p>Just wanted to say I am very much looking forward to getting OpenWRT on my C2600. I am hoping I will somehow be able to implement LACP in it as right now the ethernet port seems to be the bottleneck. My PC alone is getting ~900Mb to fileshares on my NAS over wireless which is great for the wireless side of things but with only one port going out to my network its a bit of a pain and is causing issues sharing with all the other wireless devices in the house.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not sure if the underlying switch chip (QCA8337) supports this or not.&nbsp; If so, it should be possible to implement at least in principle.</p><p>From the description of your issue I assume that you already have a separate switch with LACP support.</p><p>Since the CPU has two independent gigabit links to the switch, another thing you could try is to configure two switch ports on separate untagged vlans connected to independent cpu links.&nbsp; (You might need to vlan tag on the CPU side if you want to keep the wan functionality working at the same time).&nbsp; Then you could add both interfaces to the br-lan device and try to set up LACP within the kernel bridge.&nbsp; Not sure how much cpu load this would imply or whether 2gbps throughput is possible in that case.</p><p>It&#039;s also not clear how much of a difference this would really make, given that the throughput of 802.11ac isn&#039;t going to be much more than a gigabit even in really ideal conditions.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello All,</p><p>I assume you all know by now than some/many devs have created a new fork/project.<br />They have also merged the C2600 patches in their trunk.</p><p>What is the view/opinion of our C2600 devs for this new fork?<br />I am worried that instead of having a slow moving project we will en up with 2 VERY VERY SLOW moving projects.<br />Big companies are consolidating/merging to save resources and OSS project are splitting.</p>									</div>

					<p>One of the stated motivations of the LEDE team in creating the fork as far as I understand is that they felt too few people had commit access to openwrt svn, and that this was slowing down the handling of (in particular community-submitted) patches to an unacceptable level.</p><p>The C2600 patches are probably a concrete example of this.&nbsp; (Ok, to be fair for the initial round of submissions I was also slow iterating on requested changes and don&#039;t much like email-based patch submission.)</p><p>Where do you see the C2600 patches merged in lede trunk though?&nbsp; So far as far as I can tell they have been submitted to the lede-dev list by Ash Benz, and there is currently some iterating on minor changes.&nbsp; (ok, this is already a much faster response than on the openwrt list, so good sign for that at least.)</p><p>As for whether one prefers a big consolidated company or smaller independent ones, well that depends on how the big consolidated company is run <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
