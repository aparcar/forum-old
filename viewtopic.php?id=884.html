					<p>I&#039;ve got OpenVPN running on a WRT54GS, and have found it significantly affects throughput.</p><p>With the WRT in client mode, throughput over wireless without any VPN was about 620kbytes/sec.<br />With an OpenVPN connection terminated on the WRT, and all traffic over wireless going through the VPN, throughput dropped to about 300kbytes/sec.</p><p>Looking at the CPU usage during this transfer indicates it&#039;s definitely CPU-bound.</p><p>I&#039;ve also tried running a PPTP VPN from a client behind the WRT, and as expected, it had a negligible impact on throughput, as its not adding any overheads on the WRT, as the PPTP VPN was terminated elsewhere.</p><p>Cheers,<br />Martin.</p>									</div>
