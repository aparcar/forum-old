					<p>I&#039;m not an expert on WRT - I have been tinkering with it. However I was involved with a large IR communication project. </p><p>The solution you want can be achieved fairly easily. Linksys has already been hacked to provide 1/2 RS232 ports. Furthermore maxim makes a chip for IR communications:</p><p>Link 1: <a href="http://www.maxim-ic.com/quick_view2.cfm/qv_pk/1947/ln/en">http://www.maxim-ic.com/quick_view2.cfm … 1947/ln/en</a></p><p>Link 2: <a href="http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/HowTo/AddASerialPort">http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/HowTo/AddASerialPort</a></p><p>Reference Link: <a href="http://www.maxim-ic.com/appnotes.cfm/appnote_number/3024/ln/en">http://www.maxim-ic.com/appnotes.cfm/ap … 3024/ln/en</a></p><p>You should be able to use the chip from link 1 (Maxim 3130 or 3131) instead of the communication chip used in Link 2. That gives you an IRDA router <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p><p>The fallback is that the router needs to be near the IrDA device because IrDA cannot communicate over large distances. Most of the time, the router is hidden so that you never see it again. </p><p>I hope all this info helps.</p><p>Tell us a little more about the flow of information. How did you envision all this working (if it was working perfectly). Maybe we can come up with more innovative solutions.</p>									</div>

You could then use a USB-serial adaptor. Anything else will require hardware hacking.</p>									</div>
