					<p>Hey Guys,</p><p>I am getting a lot of the following messages in my system log:</p><p>Sun Oct&nbsp; 9 18:32:42 2016 daemon.warn odhcpd[885]: DHCPV6 SOLICIT IA_NA from 0003000180ea235a58d2 on br-lan: ok fd37:3552:7e0::792/128 </p><p>It looks these are related to clients asking the DHCP server for an IPv6 address, and since there is no gateway to route this traffic to the internet it gives this warning. The thing is, my router is configured as a dump access point. This means I have deleted the WAN interface, and for the LAN interface I have the &quot;Ignore interface - Disable DHCP for this interface&quot; box checked. I also have the &quot;Router Advertisement-Service&quot; and &quot;DHCPv6-Service&quot; set to &quot;disabled&quot; on the &quot;IPv6 settings&quot; tab.</p><p>For IPv4 this seems to be working just fine. The DHCP is successfully disabled and is not giving out IPv4 addresses. But for IPv6 the DHCP is still enabled it seems. Clients are able to get IPv6 leases from the DHCP server even though I presumably disabled it.</p><p>My question: Am I missing something? How do I disable DHCP completely, for both IPv4 AND IPv6?</p><p>Thank you very much in advance!</p>									</div>
