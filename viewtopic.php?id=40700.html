					<p>So a few weeks ago I was configuring my router (TP-Link MR3220) for my flat&#039;s internet (provided by my university, I&#039;m living in halls of residence). Turns out the internet provider does weird things with MAC filtering and NAT detection, which meant when I plugged in my router and ssh&#039;d into it, I could ping sites like google and openwrt.org. Because of the NAT detection, I couldn&#039;t do that from my laptop. </p><p>This confused me. A lot.</p><p>At the time, I thought the OpenWRT firewall was to blame, and that the best solution for this would be to repeatedly click things until it worked. </p><p>Long story short, I set the firewall up so that nothing from the LAN can access the router. The worst part is that the reset button isn&#039;t working (this is a known bug/lack of implementation) so I can&#039;t get the router into failsafe.</p><p>Since then, I did lots of googling and talking to campus IT support and figured out why connecting didn&#039;t work. I&#039;ve bought a WR-1043ND and, now it&#039;s set up right, that works perfectly.</p><p>Trouble is, I now have my original wireless router in a box, bricked. I&#039;m not a fan of leaving hardware around to die, so I&#039;m trying to get it working again. </p><p>So far, I&#039;ve checked the following:<br />Portscanning the WAN port - all ports are closed.<br />Wireshark on the WAN port - My laptop gives the router an IP address and it proceeds to do NTP stuff. Nothing I can hijack though :s<br />Portscanning the LAN port - nothing. all ports are filtered [firewall]<br />Wireshark on the LAN port - My laptop also gives the router an IP (it was configured to be just a dumb AP, not using NAT, so the LAN doesn&#039;t have a DHCP server) but past that, nothing<br />Various combinations of pressing buttens (reset button &amp; the QSS button) to no avail.</p><p>Does anyone else have any other suggestions? I don&#039;t have the kit to connect to the serial port, but if I need to I could try to borrow it.</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>
