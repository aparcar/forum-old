					<p>oh... one more query.. I have found that the ethernet interface is not getting up automatically. I have not been able to ping the router from a LAN PC. I can ping the router only if I execute the ifconfig command mannually from my board&#039;s serial console. Can anybody please help me in this regards.</p>									</div>
