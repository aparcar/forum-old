					<p>Hi,</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Recently I tried to bring up LTE910 with Bleeding Edge r39764, and put some extra prints in option.c&nbsp; (Linux3.10.32/drivers/usb/serial/, located in build_dir ) in the kernel directory which is extracted from linux3.10.32.tar.xz in the directory dl. Starting from build_dir will save time from extracting kernel and patching.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I used the following command to make the sysupgrade image:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; make target/linux/{compile,install} V=99 |tee /mnt/share/Linux-compile-install.txt.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The kernel was build into two stages. the first stage called compile deals with the modules defined in kernel and the second stage deals with the rest compiling<br />and linking of kernel image, compressing root file system and assebling lzma kernel image with compressed file system.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The make output makes perfect sense, but after I loaded the image to my module, I can not see the extra print, just the original prints in option.c.</p><p>&nbsp; The only way to see those extra prints was to change option.c in the compressed package linux3.10.32.tar.xz, and build the image with the following command:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; make target/linux/{clean,compile,install} V=99 |tee /mnt/share/clean-compile-install.txt<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Why does the first make not build the correct image?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Look forward to any help!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Tim</p>									</div>

					<p>You need to create a patch and put that in the patches dir for the kernel, then it will be applied in the build process.</p><p>Like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cp $file{,.orig}

					<p>Hi Borromini and written_direcon,</p><p>&nbsp; Thank you all for the replies!&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; If I directly change the kernel code in build_dir, I will definitely save time from unzipping and patching the kernel code from dl. </p><p>I tried to compare the differences between the two method: the one I tried and the proper&nbsp; way described in openWrt : creating and applying patches, and I found the two methods almost are the same, except that the one I tried does not go through extracting and patching.</p><p>I really want to know where the makefile in openWrt make the difference.</p><p>Thank you again!</p><p>Tim</p>									</div>
