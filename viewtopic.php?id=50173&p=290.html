					<p>Hi guys. After fighting with Linksys customer support for a week (they shipped me a v1 first) I just received my replacement wrt1900ac v2 today. Is there somewhere I can get up-to-date info on the stability? Should I be using RC3? I really just need basic openwrt stuff with vlan. Any info you can provide is much, much appreciated. Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Users are reporting varying lock-ups on RC3, and it&#039;s due to the wifi drivers.

					<p>I have extensive knowledge of linux, but only a bit of experience with openwrt. I&#039;ve been running it on a TP-Link TL-WDR3600 for a year or so and have been using vlans on that with great success.</p><p>So you recommend RC3 even with the lockups? Is it a very common thing? Does it occur, say, once every 10 minutes or once every week? I realize it&#039;s hard to gauge that sort of thing, but I&#039;m trying to get a sense of the frequency. </p><p>Also, just curious, regarding the lockups/bugs on v2...is the light at the end of the tunnel visible yet? ;-)</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
