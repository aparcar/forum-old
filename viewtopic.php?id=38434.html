					<p>Dear written_direcon</p><p>Yes I just discovered now this wiki owncloud.</p><p>I agree with you it was why I though to be able to use nginx (more efficient webserver) in place of those webservers. But I still did not find time enough to try to get it working...<br />Then if you may help with this same idea that only one (but more efficient) webserver is enough it could be appreciate ;-)</p><p>Sincerely thanks and have a nice day,</p><p>Miguipda ;-)</p>									</div>

					<p>i tried lots of different solutions and made lots of tests ... including download/upload speeds link reliability encryption level etc ... the best solution i finally settled with is AWS S3 :<br />- on linux/openwrt you can use for ex the &quot;s3cmd&quot; client in python incl to sync files<br />- you get client apps on Android MSWin etc<br />- i found the net link to be always reliable and stable even when connecting from a different country<br />- if you need extra security on AWS you can even activate MFA and you can use for ex GoogleAuth client on Android</p><p>btw when you analyze network traffic of many famous cloud backup solutions providers ... often you will find that your files are in fact redirected to AWS !</p><p>for those interested you can also compile s3fs to work on openwrt</p><p>and another thing ... it&#039;s a VERY cheap solution bec you pay only for what you use ... and AWS is so rich of features much more than just S3 backups ... just type on youtube you can find lots of easy tutorials ... and whenever i needed to contact customer service i always got a full tech answer the same day</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>I have an Netgear WNDR3800 running openwrt Attitude Adjustement 12.09 RC1 (ar71xx platform).<br />I tried to install owncloud, using lighttpd running luci + owncloud at the same time (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/owncloud">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/owncloud</a>).</p><p>After following the wiki I just cannot access owncloud.</p><p>My web browser remains stuck endlessly on&nbsp; index.php trying to load something (no time out).<br />Sometimes I get an error 500, but I cannot load the owncloud main page..</p><p>I checked many times all config files (lighttpd.conf, php.ini) and my doc-root in lighttpd.conf....</p><br /><p>I tried owncloud before on backfire 10.03.1 and I could display owncloud webpage, but I had to upgrade to AA because of the PHP 5 ZIP missing library..</p><p>It seems there is something wrong in AA 12.09 RC1, maybe in the php5-mod librairies ??? <br />At least if it was working properly with Backfire....</p><br /><p>I will try to run owncloud using uhttpd instead of lighttpd on AA 12.09 RC1 and see if it is working...</p><br /><p>QUESTIONS:</p><p>&gt;&gt; Can you tell me which version of OopenWRT you are using (BACKFIRE or AA) and if those are trunk or normal packages ?</p><p>&gt;&gt; I couldnt find the php5-mod-zip package in trunk packages&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Will it be back ??(http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/packages/) </p><br /><br /><p>&gt;&gt; Does somebody succeeded to run owncloud on a NETGEAR WNDR 3800?? <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If so, are you using BACKFIRE + trunk/ php5-mod packages OR AA +packages ? What did you do precisely?</p><br /><br /><p>Does anyone have an idea ?</p><br /><p>Thanks in advance for ypur replies</p>									</div>
