					<p>Hezy all!</p><p>So recently I ordered this tiny little tp-link box to run 3g usb stick.</p><p>It came in chinese and had no option to change the language, so I decided to put openwrt on it.</p><p>I went with this guide: <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/village-telco-dev/UlGxUTlj9mM/cUK0dqln3ywJ%5B1-25%5D">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/v … %5B1-25%5D</a></p><p>...and I dove in into depths that are far too deep for me.</p><p>Basically, I managed to flash the firmware onto the modem,and got as far as having SSH access to the box.</p><p> but SSHing into things and stuff is unknown territory for me.</p><p>Is there anyway I can put openwrt with webgui preinstalled on this box? Currently, according to the guide, I have to edit/move a bunch of files and I&#039;m simply afraid I will break something.</p><p>If someone could tell me how I could reflash onto an open-wrt software version that would have webGUI preinstalled - I would be most thankful!!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey thanks for the answer!</p><p>However:</p><p>1) I am a noob and I have no clue how to edit the connection settings with vi editor</p><p>2) In the state the router is in now, I can only connect to it via lan cable (no wireless).

					<p>haha i think it is unpossible to brick cause you have ssh/telnet/web/serial(ttl)/wireless connections <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /> <br />hmm can you get any of those connections except serial ?</p><p>-- and please use tutorials from openwrt/wiki and forum cause you will get more help from more experienced users than me --</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fpopic</strong> on 17 Aug 2012, 22:40)</p>

					<p>Actually I did manage to &quot;unbrick&quot; it. The thing is that this router doesn&#039;t support standard reset.

					<p>@monotube: that&#039;s great! Is there an easy way to dump this from the busybox interface? I looked into failsafe image upload options, but it includes yet another myriad of acronyms that are unknown to me.</p><p>By uploading I mean that I want to download it to my pc and then transfer it onto the router via ssh, as I&#039;m currently still struggling to get the box to connect to the internet.</p>									</div>
