					<p>Hi </p><p>I know I&#039;ve asked this before about mounting USB storage to OpenWRT but I didn&#039;t get anything from it. I have the Linksys WRT1900AC which has two USB ports. I have plenty of USB HDD&#039;s and flash sticks and I want to use some of them for an public FTP server, a local media server and also a local network folder (Samba). I&#039;ve read on a couple of places that you have to install NTFS-3G or something to allow writing to NTFS formats. I also know that I need Mount Points installed which I have but even when I plug a FAT32 one in the list doesn&#039;t update. I also tried clicking on the add button to have a play around but I haven&#039;t got a clue what I&#039;m doing because I&#039;m no Linux or OpenWRT expert.</p><p>Any help very much appreciated</p><p>Will</p>									</div>

					<p>I have already obtained basic USB support and all of the packages are installed. I&#039;ve plugged in a NTFS USB 2.0 flash drive into the first USB port and went to mount points listed under System and nothing is listed. However, recently I installed a trunk of OpenWRT and it seems there is a temporary mount which I would like to get rid of shown as</p><p>ubi1:syscfg&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /tmp/syscfg&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;29.16 MB / 30.80 MB&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0% (32.00 KB)</p><p>tmpfs&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/dev&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;512.00 KB / 512.00 KB&nbsp; 0% (0.00 B) </p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i65.tinypic.com/rihx85.jpg" alt="http://i65.tinypic.com/rihx85.jpg" /></span></p><p>When I click on the unmount button next to first option I&#039;m presented with this page</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i68.tinypic.com/2ir24y0.jpg" alt="http://i68.tinypic.com/2ir24y0.jpg" /></span></p><p>Just to point out I have 0% knowledge of mount points or Linux. This is all completely alien to me. All I want to be able to do is plug in various USB storage devices setup a local media/samba server and torrent client and use another partition on the USB storage for a public FTP server. It sounds so simple but I have no clew what I&#039;m doing and the Wiki help guides are beyond my understanding.</p><p>Will</p><p>UPDATE:</p><p>I found this script for &#039; hotplugging&#039; automounting NTFS drives which now lists the NTFS drive under mount points, found at &#039;/ect/hotplug.d/block/10-mount&#039;. However, the unmount button doesn&#039;t work. </p><p>I also tried plugging in a FAT32 drive but so far that hasn&#039;t listed at all. I have PuTTY installed and tried guessing at some commands trying to unmount and mount the driv(s) before using the script to mount it for me, but I get no luck. </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
