					<p>Hi,</p><p> I broke CFE on that PON router [and currently having no output on console] and attempting to recover. JTAG pinout is not known, so I am currently looking in a different direction.</p><p> First thing to mention: there is a NAND flash. Am I right that there should be some software that executes before [broken] CFE and copies CFE from [from a disk-alike-block] NAND to RAM?<br /> Next thing what I&#039;ve noticed: after turning on the router there is a carrier on LAN1 and LAN2 (and LEDs are flashing on activity), but no carrier on LAN2 and LAN4. Does that prove that something has been executed and initialized LAN1 and LAN2?<br /> What is known about that pre-cfe-nand-to-ram loading software? Where it resides? (hardcoded in CPU or in blocks marked as bad in NAND even? If so, how it loads?) Can I interact with it somehow (for restoring CFE)?</p><p>As I understand, there is no documentation on BCM chips (at least for this generation)? For what words to google?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, do you know there are several revisions of F660 - one is Broadcom based, the other is some ARM?</p><p>By &quot;getting in&quot; do you mean you cannot find console in F660/Broadcom? Or getting in via JTAG?</p>									</div>

					<p>if it is a broadcom, there maybe be a way to load something to ram.<br />u need to solder to serial pinout, and look at log.<br />before power , press and keep pressed <strong>wps</strong> button, and then power, u will see an xmodem query, if not see that, ur device is bricked for good.<br />i have an 660, also bricked, but mine is deep bricked, cannot press wps.</p><p>look how it works.</p><p>there is a cferom, who low initialize device, that cferom copy cferam to ram and execute from there.</p><p>i think u need to upload this file to ram via xmodem.</p><p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/r5dcnchwr45qi3x/rootfs1.bin?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/r5dcnchwr45qi â€¦ 1.bin?dl=0</a></p>									</div>
