					<p>I searched through this forum as well as OpenWRT TOH and could not find any mention of this <a href="http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-Details.asp?EdpNo=8519134&amp;sku=WED-101768992">Wstern Digital My Cloud 2TB Personal Cloud Storage - NAS, Gigabit Interface, with USB 3.0 Expansion Port - WDBCTL0020HWT-NESN</a>. I supposed this device isn&#039;t supported by OpenWRT, yet. Nevertheless, does anyone know what type of 2-core CPU as well as the capacity of RAM/FLASH this device has?</p>									</div>

					<p>The WD My Cloud employs a <a href="http://support.mindspeed.com/products/cpe-processors/comcertoreg-2000">Mindspeed Comcerto 2000-Series</a> (to be exact, it&#039;s a M86261G-12 dual-core ARM-Cortex A9 SoC, rated at 650 MHz) -- which is not an OpenWrt target (yet). It is complemented by 256 MB of RAM and a 512 MB flash chip, which the system uses only as a bootstrap for booting off the hard drive. The stock firmware is running a heavily customized Debian Wheezy, but it&#039;s not a problem to run a <a href="https://community.wd.com/t/clean-debian-and-openmediavault-on-wdmycloud/93714">completely clean, full and proper Debian Jessie on it</a>.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 25 Nov 2015, 21:50)</p>

					<p>Thanks. A 256 MB of RAM is plentiful, AFAICT.</p>									</div>
