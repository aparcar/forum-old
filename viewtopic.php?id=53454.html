When I use logread I get this:</p><p>logread: can&#039;t find syslogd buffer: No such file or directory</p><br /><p>The wiki says procd has now assumed syslogd functionality and therefore syslogd is no longer needed but I can find nowhere that indicates how to get procd setup for logging. I was hoping there was a simple answer so I don&#039;t have to dig into the sources (time is tight right now).</p><p>Thanks,</p>									</div>

					<p>Looks like the wiki page is incorrect. Either way, my problem appears to be an issue of selectig the right logread to match the logd being used (busybox vs. standalone).</p>									</div>

					<p>Aside from the wiki being incorrect in a number of areas my real issue was a buildroot configuration issue. After realizing that logd was already loaded as part of ubox it becomes obvious there is no need to select ANY logging daemon options in busybox or elsewhere except logread in busybox. One wouldn&#039;t know that without digging through revision notes and the sources . </p><p>Anyhow, I hope this info helps someone else.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wingspinner</strong> on 20 Oct 2014, 19:31)</p>
