					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;ve installed backfire (10.03) and add the package Coovachilli (1.2.1). Wifi, dhcp by coova and so are ok.<br />When a client connect to the hotspot, he&#039;s got an ip (10.1.0.x/24), arrives on the &quot;redirecting&quot; coova page. Then coova tries to redirect him to &quot;<a href="http://10.1.0.1:3990/www/login.chi">http://10.1.0.1:3990/www/login.chi</a>&quot;</p><p>There is no login.chi (or any others miniportal files) in the package ; /etc/chilli/www/ contains a few files only. I&#039;ve checked an RPM of Coovachilli for Mandriva and also the source from cova.org. There are many more files (including login.chi).<br />Is there any reason for the difference ? </p><p>Also I&#039;ve of course tried to copy all the files to /etc/chilli/www, check with netstat -an that openwrt is listening on 80, 3390 and 4490 on ip 10.1.0.1, but the redirection is still not working.</p><p>Any ideas of what I can check ? Should I download some additionnal package for backfire ? I&#039;ve searched opkg -list *coova* *portal* and so and found nothing relevant.</p><p>Thks for any hints.</p><p>BRgds,<br />Ethariel</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>auto-answering.<br />So indeed the Coovachilli package for Backfire is using /etc/chilli/www/login.chi in the config files, and does not provide /etc/chilli/www basic files.<br />You can copy files from coovachilli sources or from an older installation.<br />My previous test was not working with copy due an error during transfert.</p><p>Brgds<br />Ethariel</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ethariel</strong> on 20 Jul 2010, 15:56)</p>
