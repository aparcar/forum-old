					<p>Hi, i am using openwrt on a tp-link wr1043nd v2 the router. It is set up in an windows domain enviroment meaning that its got and external dns server i would like it to use but i want to retain its internal router dhcp server. The problem is that when i try to forward requests and ask to resolv our internal domain adresess in the form name.domain i get an respons that the adres is bad, when i configure a pc manually to the internal windows dns servers it works fine. I use multiple routers in my configuration and would like to know is it possiblem and if yes how to configure dnsmasq to forward all requests to my windows dns server.</p>									</div>
