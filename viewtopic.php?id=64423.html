					<p>Hi All, </p><p>I currently bought a R6250 which I thought I would be able to use OpenWRT but I&#039;m having serious problems even getting it connected to the internet. Also, I read on the main forum thread for the R6250 that the Wifi is super slow.</p><p>I got the router with Astrill VPN when I got the VPN for working in China. But someone on Reddit converted my to use Shadowsocks for my PC and it&#039;s awesome. I want to use the same/similar thing for router. He told me only OpenWRT supports shadowsocks and was wondering if anyone could recommend a compatible router?</p><p>Thank you!</p><p>Dustin</p>									</div>
