					<p>I have been successfully running openWRT on a WNDR3700v3.<br />Now I am trying investigate the causes of &#039;invalid SPROM read&#039; as show in the log file below.&nbsp; And hopefully fixit.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[    0.640000] bcma: bus1: Found chip with id 0x4331, rev 0x02 and package 0x08
