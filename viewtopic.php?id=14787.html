					<p>I was trying to install the new Kamikaze 7.09 for my Lynksis Wrt54g3g-st but I got the wrong .trx. What I installed was the pp-openwrt-linksys.trx. I am a complete newb on this and I was trying to download whatever I needed to do things right... but what did I do... I wrecked my router. Please I need help on what to do. I want to install the whiterussian instead. Can I do that now or do I have to throw the router in the trash? pp-openwrt-linksys.trx is Packet Protector something for Lynksis routers. I use windows and don&#039;t know nothing about Linux. I have ussed putty before. Is there any way to fix this? Please HELP...</p>									</div>
