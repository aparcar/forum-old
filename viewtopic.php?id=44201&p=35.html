					<p>Hi,</p><p>I wanted to notify you on my recent discovery. I&#039;ve bought wdr7500v5 from Ali at the end of April. I had intentions to mod it to archer c7v2 with the flash swap.

					<p>I recently got an AC1750 with Firmware version 3.14.3 Build 151014 Rel.49676n that I&#039;m trying to flash. When uploading the openwrt factory I keep getting the following error:</p><p><em>Error code: 18005<br />Upgrade unsuccessfully because the version of the upgraded file was incorrect. Please check the file name.</em></p><p>I&#039;ve tried renaming it openwrt.bin and ArcherC7v2_en_3_14_3_up_boot(150427).bin as suggested in this chain, but I always get the same error. </p><p>Anything else I can try?</p>									</div>

					<p>what firewormus is saying is that there&#039;s now two versions of v2.</p><p>Try flashing trunk version ... it contains a new kernel that supports the gigadevice flash.</p><p>Alternatively, you can build your own version of 15.05 using a patched kernel, the patch for the chip should already be in the branch, or at least it&#039;s on the openwrt-devel mailing list.</p><p>Wiki has all the instructions on building and contributing, give it a read.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I was already reading through some threads and the wiki. I was able to successfully flash 15.05.1 on my Archer C7 v2 without any serious problems. The router is currently set to AP and everything works as expected. The only thing I am not sure is the current status of the ath10k driver and 5Ghz wireless.</p><p>Does the current version contain a driver which allows 5Ghz wireless at 160Mhz? I am not able to get it to work but this may also be a misconfiguration.

To be honest I&#039;m not sure if I ever heard of a 160MHz chipset. I know the standard allows for it, but all the ac stuff is mostly 80MHz. Some devices even do 40MHz 802.11ac</p>									</div>
