					<p>Hi!</p><p>I&#039;m using the following setup:</p><p>External USB antenna receiving internet signal and connected to the comtrend ar-5387un usb port and comtrend repeating the signal to the rest of the house. My problem is that antenna is receiving 20mb and comtrend is repeating 3mb and seems that this router cannot do it better. So i decided to buy a tp-link archer c7 v2 and substitute the comtrend.</p><p>I have the c7 with openwrt installed and the necessary modules to recognize the antenna like i did with the comtrend. But i don&#039;t know why, the internet is not working. <br />The antenna is listed on the wifi tab with the other interfaces and when i scan networks with the antenna interface i can detect all the networks so, it works, but after connecting to the network i want, it doesn&#039;t work. <br />The signal is always at 0% and it&#039;s not receiving/sending pakets. I&#039;m connected but it&#039;s like i don&#039;t have connection.<br />And i don&#039;t know what&#039;s the problem. The same steps and configuration is working with the comtrend but not with the c7.</p><p>The antenna&#039;s chipset is a ralink3070. </p><p>Any help? </p><p>Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>orella</strong> on 16 Mar 2017, 19:45)</p>

					<p>The client interface needs to be the only thing in it&#039;s network (usually wan).&nbsp; That network can&#039;t be a bridge.&nbsp; Trying to put a wifi client into a bridge will shut it down.</p>									</div>

					<p>But connecting using internal antennas works. It doesn&#039;t work when using the external. With the same configuration, nothing is changed. Why? <br />And using internals is not a solution because the signal is poor.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>orella</strong> on 16 Mar 2017, 22:59)</p>

					<p>Does iw list show that you have three radios (internal 2, internal 5, external 2)?</p><p>They may not necessarily be detected and defined in that order though.&nbsp; Check the radio paths in /etc/config/wireless to be sure you&#039;re using the USB one where you want to.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 17 Mar 2017, 01:12)</p>
