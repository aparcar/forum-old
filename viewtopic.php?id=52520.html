					<p>Hi All, I flashed my WD N600 router with a version of OpenWRT (CHAOS CALMER (Bleeding Edge, r42038) that did not have Luci installed.&nbsp; I have tried to install Luci through command line (putty) and also tried minimalistic offline install (using Winscp / Putty) as suggested (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials</a>).&nbsp; None of these options worked.</p><p>(Note: a lot of the files suggested to download from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/packages/packages/)">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … packages/)</a> for the luci minimilistic offline install are NOT in the suggested link.. so for those who try this option - this tutorial does not help much as Luci will fail to install because of those missing files.</p><p>Question: Is there a way to reflash the router with without having web-browser access to my router (as per prob above).&nbsp; Note: I can access router via putty and winscp.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>You have the link slightly wrong.<br />The generic link is: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/packages/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … /packages/</a></p><p>Basic reason is that you have too old trunk version (yes, a few weeks). The download config has changed since your firmware was compiled. Now there is <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/packages/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … /packages/</a><br />under which there are several subdirectories. One on them is luci:<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/packages/luci/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … ages/luci/</a><br />And all the luci packages are there.</p><p>You could fix your opkg config to match the current download structure and then install luci: <br />read this: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=243943#p243943">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 43#p243943</a></p><p>You could also use wget to download a new firmware for your router (to ramdisk) and then use &#039;sysupgrade&#039; script to flash it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 1 Sep 2014, 14:25)</p>

					<p>Hey thanks, I ended up just taking your latter advice and re-flashing the router from putty using the info in link (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.sysupgrade">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.sysupgrade</a>) it worked a treat.&nbsp; The version i downloaded also had Luci build into it already so no dramas anymore!&nbsp; </p><p>Also, I will remember the links you sent me regarding the Luci packages and no doubt i will need them soon enough.</p><p>Cheers again</p>									</div>

					<p>You won&#039;t actually need the links with a new firmware.<br />Simple &quot;opkg update&quot; should download and update the packages lists (also to Luci), the your new firmware should already have the correct opkg config.</p>									</div>

					<p>maybe just stick to barrier breaker builds, which include luci starting with RC3 and is also getting pretty close to final. I don&#039;t think there is any big advantage to chaos calmer at this point in time.</p>									</div>
