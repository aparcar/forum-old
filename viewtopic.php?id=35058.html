					<p>I&#039;ve recently upgraded three routers from 0.9 White Russian to 10.03.1 backfire. Yay! All went well, with nary a forum posting to clarify why QoS wasn&#039;t working or how to get firewall logging enabled. I figured it all out on my own power.</p><p>Two of my routers are Linksys WRT54G v2 and the other is a Buffalo WBR2-G54S -- not exactly speed demons, but they work fine when just sitting their routing and firewalling.</p><p>But, I notice when running the web interface, particularly screens that refresh, the CPU utilization is &quot;high&quot;.&nbsp; I see the highest CPU utilization when running the scrolling realtime graphs. For example, at the moment my main router sometimes shows a load average of 2.8. </p><p>Mem: 22368K used, 7264K free, 0K shrd, 1796K buff, 10120K cached<br />CPU:&nbsp; 61% usr&nbsp; 38% sys&nbsp; &nbsp;0% nic&nbsp; &nbsp;0% idle&nbsp; &nbsp;0% io&nbsp; &nbsp;0% irq&nbsp; &nbsp;0% sirq<br />Load average: 1.53 1.50 1.37 3/40 3132<br />&nbsp; PID&nbsp; PPID USER&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;STAT&nbsp; &nbsp;VSZ %MEM %CPU COMMAND<br /> 3082&nbsp; 1547 root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;R&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2124&nbsp; &nbsp;7%&nbsp; 52% /usr/bin/lua /www/cgi-bin/luci </p><p>If left running like this for extended periods of time, will the router overheat and get damaged? </p><p>During normal times, CPU is running at a load average of 0.01 if even that.</p>									</div>
