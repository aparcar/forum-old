					<p>I&#039;m using the latest Designated Driver.</p><p>In a <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=67740">previous question</a> I learned that the router needs to be set in <strong>relay mode</strong> to be able to assign IPv6 addresses from my ISP to the clients on the network.</p><p>To recap, these are the lines that are need to be changed in /etc/config/network for this kind of setup to work (I have indicated changes from firmware defaults):</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config dhcp &#039;lan&#039;
        option interface &#039;lan&#039;
        option start &#039;100&#039;
        option limit &#039;150&#039;
        option leasetime &#039;12h&#039;
        option ra &#039;relay&#039;       # Changed to relay
        option dhcpv6 &#039;relay&#039;   # Changed to relay
        option ndp &#039;relay&#039;      # Added

# Section commented
#config dhcp &#039;wan&#039;
#       option interface &#039;wan&#039;
#       option ignore &#039;1&#039;

# Section added
config dhcp &#039;wan6&#039;
        option interface &#039;wan6&#039;
        option dhcpv6 &#039;relay&#039;
        option ra &#039;relay&#039;
        option ndp &#039;relay&#039;
        option master &#039;1&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Now I&#039;m trying to recreate this setup by using LuCI.</p><p>Under <strong>Interfaces - LAN - [Edit] - DHCP Server - IPv6 Settings</strong> I find the settings that takes care of the first section above by setting <strong>Router Advertisement-Service</strong>, <strong>DHCPv6-Service</strong> and <strong>NDP-Proxy</strong> to <strong>relay mode</strong>.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://i.sli.mg/shTTS5.png" alt="https://i.sli.mg/shTTS5.png" /></span></p><p>But I can not figure out how to:<br /></p><ol class="decimal"><li><p>Get rid of the dhcp &#039;wan&#039; section and</p></li><li><p>Add the dhcp &#039;wan6&#039; section including the relay options</p></li></ol><p>There is no corresponding DHCP section on <strong>Interfaces - WAN</strong> or <strong>Interfaces - WAN6</strong>. I&#039;ve also gone through the settings on under <strong>DHCP and DNS</strong> but I can&#039;t find anything related to setting the router up in relay mode.</p><p>If I modify the network file manually and the use LuCI to change network settings it will play nice and leave my manual edits, it just removes the comments.</p><p>Does LuCI not support this setup, or I&#039;m I missing how to do it? I must confess that I do not understand about 30% of the settings in LuCI.</p>									</div>

I use it in three different places. Two TP-Link and one portable D-Link router. It&#039;s inside this post: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=68901">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=68901</a></p><p>If NDP-proxy doesn&#039;t work at all you can try to broute (bridge IPv6 and route IPv4). There&#039;s an example here, but I haven&#039;t tried it yet: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/ipv6_brouter">https://wiki.openwrt.org/ipv6_brouter</a></p><p>In my opinion, regulatory bodies in the telecommunications sector in each country should determine how IPv6 is to be deployed. This should be done with penalties such as: Do it right or you are banned from selling Internet. It&#039;s a shame they&#039;re late for it. ISPs have already invested in the wrong setups and are laughing at customers. I bet now they have many economic justifications for not changing what is done so regulatory bodies will not push it anymore. As the customers we are stuck in the dark age of Internet (IPv4 CG-NAT + IPv6 with multiple failures).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>AndreL</strong> on 16 Dec 2016, 12:25)</p>
