					<p>Ok, maybe I&#039;m just an id10t when it comes to configuring Samba. I&#039;ve got it to work in the past, using optware on dd-wrt and in various linux distros...&nbsp; but I can&#039;t for the life of me get authentication working properly on OpenWRT.</p><p>Here&#039;s what I&#039;ve done:<br /> - Start by building OpenWRT with luci-samba (which includes samba3) or opkg installing luci-samba and samba3. Verify smbd is running.<br /> - Set up a simple share to share the /mnt/sda1 as &#039;data&#039; , guest OK. Should be wide-open, but attempts to list shares or browse any share prompts for a user/pass. Nothing the client provides works. (Tried windows 7 and linux)<br /> - smb.conf.template has guest account = nobody. Added map to guest = bad user. That has always fixed guest access before, but not this time.<br /> - If I edit smb.conf.template to set security = share, I can list shares and access shares that are set public. I still can&#039;t access shares that aren&#039;t public. I really don&#039;t want to have all shares public.<br /> - I see smb.conf.template has invalid users = root set. If I create a new user1 in /etc/passwd and set a password for user1 with smbpasswd, I can log in and list shares with that user, but I still can&#039;t access a share, even if the share is public or I have user1 as a valid user for that share<br /> - I thought maybe the user1 account isn&#039;t working. I&#039;ve tried removing invalid user = root and setting a samba password for root with smbpasswd. Still doesn&#039;t work even if the client tries to log in as root. (and I know you can, because I had it that way on dd-wrt)</p><p>Essentially, the problem I&#039;m having: any access that would require authentication isn&#039;t working, and in security = user mode, the client HAS to auth even for guest access (it fails but unknown users get mapped to guest). Windows 7 uses NTLMv2, which samba3 should support, but smbclient on linux uses legacy auth which should always work on any version of samba.</p><p>So what am I missing? Anyone get samba working on OpenWRT?</p>									</div>

					<p>I had the same problem and I solved by creating a symbolic link<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ln -s /tmp/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf</code></pre></div><p>Infact the script /etc/init.d/samba points to the file /tmp/smb.conf but the daemon smbd load the configuration from the file /etc/samba/smb.conf<br />However it is important to set the file /etc/config/samba as needed.</p>									</div>
