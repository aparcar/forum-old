					<p>I&#039;ve been trying to put together a machine for a test network from hardware that I already had laying around. The chosen machine to act as the router is an old p3 who&#039;s motherboard includes three ISA slots. I would prefer to use all six slots on the motherboard for the Ethernet cards, but the current build system doesn&#039;t enable ISA by default.&nbsp; So far my attempts to enable these cards have been met with frustration.&nbsp; I am beginning to wonder if I should compile the kernel separately from the rest of the build. I would prefer to not do this in the interest of simplicity, but so far it has been looking like this may be the only way to be able to use these cards.&nbsp; The Openwrt distribution I&#039;m trying to use is Attitude Adjustment x86 and the ISA cards in question is the 3com 509 and the ISA ne2k cards.</p>									</div>
