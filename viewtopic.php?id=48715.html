					<p>I have installed Openwrt 12.09 on newly bought TL-WDR3600. <br />When 1 wifi client is using device - everything is perfect. When I try to connect second wifi client - the problem begins. Package loss (ping 15%-80% loss), package delays etc. I have tried various configurations, with 5GHZ on/off (I use only 2.4GHz), various channels and various client devices. Effect is always the same - more then 1 wifi client - means package loss.<br />The wire connection works without any troubles.</p><p>Do you have any ideas how to solve this problem?&nbsp; Maybe some configuration change? Drivers?<br />(I would prefer not&nbsp; to go back to original firmware, this is a last option)</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for quick reply. So installing trunk version should solve the problem? I will do it as soon as possible <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>I have just upgraded to latest trunk. The result is not satisfying. I do still have package loss and big variance in ping packages response time. With one wifi device works more or less OK. As a bonus I lost luci (/etc/init.d/luci_fixme suggest that its not working yet in trunk, am I right?). So for now I am still using wifi on my old dlink dir-615 and using wdr3600 only as wired router.</p><p>What more can I try?</p>									</div>

					<p>/etc/init.d/uhttpd start - helped for luci </p><p>Regarding channel/tx power - the first I just tried to copy the same setting I had in my old router - but the result was pretty bad. Now after series of experiments I have effect which is almost satisfying. Majority of devices can connect via wifi properly. Unfortunately for some of them I have to keep the old router.</p>									</div>

					<p>On my channel there is sometimes one device more - at about -85 dBm. My device has about -40 dBm. On neighbours channels - some devices with 70-80 dBm. This is a current state.<br />By &quot;before and after&quot; - you mean before and after changing the distance? I don&#039;t want to reload configuration frequently and disturb the users (sometimes after configuration reloading wlan0 goes down and it takes some time to restore it). So&nbsp; - experiments only at late evening or weekend. Thanks a lot for a tip!</p>									</div>

					<p>By before and after I mean: before = AA, after = Trunk. But since you have less or more satisfying results, I suppose that the sensitivity and range have improved. You&#039;re welcome and thank you for every provided info! I&#039;m currently too busy to perform an update because I have many other things running on my device (extroot, minidlna, NAS, ftp server, loadbalancing etc) so I will need a whole weekend to reconfigure everything.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I have the same symptoms.<br />Wifi quality is very uncertain, when I use more than one device at the time.</p><p>The fix in the newer trunks did not solve anything, sensitivity is not better.<br />Signal is strong, but throughput is _very_ low and I have packet losses.</p><p>My old WR703N was performing better.</p><p>(I have WDR3600 version 1.5 with r39424)</p>									</div>

					<p>We narrowed situation to 3 client devices and made some experiments. To keep it simple we are checking only ping response.<br />The situation is as follows:</p><p>1. Devices A and B have about 2-3 meters to the TL-WDR3600. Ping response time has big variance but no package loss is observed<br />2. We are connecting device C which is about 10 meters far from the router. Now the story begins:&nbsp; A and B are starting to have big package loss (and&nbsp; bigger variance) and are practically unable to use wifi. Despite it - C has the same ping result as devices A and B described in point 1.</p><p>I hope that describing this may help a little in the investigation.</p>									</div>
