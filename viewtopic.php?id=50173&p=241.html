Most modern devices have built in thermometers used to halt the device before the device fails. In old devices the chip would be fried permanently.</p><p>The flowchart was created as an &quot;art of the possible&quot;; a 20 second monitor with a gradual increase in fan speed and some 5 second secondary loops to monitor and rapidly cool the offending device.</p><p>The main object was to prevent the WRT1900AC from dropping connections IF under sustained heavy loads temperature was in fact the cause.&nbsp; The fan control should likely also have some data collection so that it could be dumped and analyzed.</p><p>I don&#039;t think that anyone here knows for certain why load averages suddenly go up or why, when or if the temperature is going to spike or whether any of the above really matters.</p><p>The temperature differentials could be completely removed and the normal temperature monitoring set to 5 seconds (or any other suitable value). But, there would need to be monitoring of the DDR &amp; WIFI and the highest of the 3 temperatures would need to set the fan speed. Then there is still the issue of rapid escalation of a load average; there being 3 of them.</p><p>There are so many issues at play here as to why the WRT1900AC &quot;crashes&quot;.&nbsp; If fan control software can keep the router running instead of crashing; perhaps more data will show up in someone&#039;s logs that will result in a permanent fix and the &quot;fancy&quot; fan control won&#039;t be needed.</p><p>Rick.</p>									</div>
