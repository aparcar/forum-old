					<p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyci/">PyCI</a> (<a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/screenshots.php?group_id=287198">screenshots</a>) and l2sh are now generally available for use with OpenWRT...</p><p>Download<br />=======<br />Here&#039;s how to get PyCI/l2sh into your OpenWRT build dir:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>echo &quot;src-svn pyci https://pyci.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pyci/package&quot; &gt;&gt; trunk/feeds.conf.default
cd trunk; ./scripts/feeds update ; ./scripts/feeds install -a</code></pre></div><p>(Note: Not sure if you&#039;re supposed to just add it to &quot;feeds.conf&quot;)</p><p>Alternatively, you can download/install the ipks from the Sourceforge site.</p><p><strong>Important Note:</strong> PyCI requires that Python be patched before you can use it.&nbsp; See <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/6192#comment:4">#6192</a> (you can fix an existing Python install by deleting one line in a file--see the patch).&nbsp; These patches--along with an updated version of Python--were submitted for inclusion into OpenWRT (see <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/6407">#6407</a>.&nbsp; They just haven&#039;t made it into trunk yet.</p><p>PyCI<br />====</p><p>About<br />-------<br />PyCI (Python Configuration Interface) is a web-based configuration GUI written for OpenWRT.&nbsp; It is built with Python on top of the <a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/">Tornado framework</a> (Note: Original version was built on CherryPy) and features the <a href="https://launchpad.net/eftw">Escape From The Web</a> shell (a web-based terminal emulator that drops down, Quake-style when you hit the ESC key).</p><p>The primary philosophy of PyCI is this: If a config file lets you have as many entries as you want so should the GUI.&nbsp; For example, most web-based configuration interfaces will list two fields for entering DNS servers (primary and secondary).&nbsp; With PyCI&#039;s style of configuration you can enter as many DNS servers as you want!</p><p>Another key element to PyCI is the ability for users to edit configuration files directly.&nbsp; All configuration pages of PyCI include the ability to edit the config file directly.&nbsp; For example, the user administration page lets you edit /etc/passwd (and /etc/shadow) directly and the network interface configuration page lets you edit /etc/config/network directly.</p><p>PyCI has configuration elements for the following:<br /> * dnsmasq (/etc/config/dhcp)<br /> * ddns-scripts (/etc/config/ddns)<br /> * OpenWRT&#039;s firewall (/etc/config/firewall)<br /> * Network interfaces (/etc/config/network)<br /> * QOS/Traffic shaping (/etc/config/qos)<br /> * Static routes (/etc/config/network)<br /> * Switch configuration (/etc/config/network)<br /> * Wireless radios (/etc/config/wireless)<br /> * Quagga (aka &quot;Advanced Routing&quot;)<br /> * Coova Chilli<br /> * Cron<br /> * Dropbear SSH (/etc/config/dropbear)<br /> * NTP client (/etc/config/ntpclient)<br /> * Backup &amp; Restore (saves contents of /etc as a tarball)<br /> * Hostname (/etc/config/system)<br /> * Hosts (/etc/hosts)<br /> * Init scripts (/etc/init.d and /etc/rc.d)<br /> * System logs (dmesg and logread and elements of /etc/config/system)<br /> * Timezone (/etc/config/system)<br /> * Users and Groups (/etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, and /etc/group)</p><p>PyCI also provides some utility functions:<br /> * Network speed test (command line and/or GUI fat client can be used)<br /> * Common network utilities (ping, traceroute, tcpdump)<br /> * Listening services (taken from netstat)<br /> * System monitors with real-time graphs (CPU, load, network, and memory utilization)<br /> * Firewall status (grid view of all your iptables rules).</p><p>Requirements<br />----------------<br />PyCI requires Python (full version--not just python-mini), python-sqlite3, python-openssl (which requires libopenssl), Tornado (which requires pycurl which requires libcurl) and about a megabyte of free space.&nbsp; You should be able to squeeze all of that (and a bit more) into an 8MB firmware but I haven&#039;t tried it.&nbsp; All dependencies should be selected automatically when PyCI is installed or enabled in &#039;make menuconfig&#039;.</p><p>Notes<br />-------<br />PyCI is currently under heavy development so there are a few rough edges.&nbsp; If you encounter bugs please submit them on our <a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/pyci/newticket">Trac site</a>.</p><p>FYI: PyCI was developed as an entry into the <a href="http://www.ubnt.com/challenge/">$200,000 RouterStation UI/Firmware Challenge</a>.&nbsp; It was declared one of the grand prize winners (first place was a tie between PyCI and NETSHe).&nbsp; The current theme for PyCI includes the RouterStation logo (was a design requirement of the contest) but a more generic theme will be released soon (there really isn&#039;t anything else in PyCI specific to that platform).</p><p>l2sh<br />====<br />l2sh stands for &quot;Layer 2 Shell&quot;.&nbsp; It is similar to the emergency access daemon (ead--which no one knows how to use <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> ) in that it lets you log into your router remotely even if your IP configuration is hosed.&nbsp; It is a very simple python script that can act as both a server and a client.&nbsp; It is currently considered alpha quality (at best, hah!) but it <strong>really does work</strong> for its intended purpose.&nbsp; If anyone wants to help out I&#039;d really appreciate it (my knowledge of layer-2 network programming in Python is severley limited).</p><p>l2sh doesn&#039;t have it&#039;s own project site yet but it will eventually.&nbsp; Right now I&#039;m focused on improving PyCI.</p><p>Lastly...<br />======<br />All feedback is welcome!&nbsp; Also, I would love to hear about people running PyCI on platforms other than the RouterStation.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have any other hardware to test it with!&nbsp; I want to see if someone can get it running on a system with only 8MB of flash.</p>									</div>
