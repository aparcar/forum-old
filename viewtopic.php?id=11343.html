					<p>The multimedia menu will only appear when you have packages that belong to that category.&nbsp; Since you provide no additional info about <span class="bbu">anything</span> I am going to assume that you performed a clean checkout from the svn repository.&nbsp; This provides you with the core set of packages, which are pages needed for proper functionality of devices.&nbsp; In order to obtain all the extra/additional packages available you have to run `make package/symlinks&#039;&nbsp; to checkout <a href="https://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/packages">https://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/packages</a> into your trunk/feeds/ folder and symlink every package contained therein to trunk/package/&nbsp; &nbsp;After running that command a simple `make menuconfig&#039; will cause buildroot-ng to parse all the new package information.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry about my noble but foolish desire to be terse.</p><p>A better subject for this thread would have been, &quot;Why aren&#039;t there any menuconfig options for video anymore?&quot;</p><p>I want to use the pwc modules with v4l, and there don&#039;t seem to be any menuconfig options for either of them.</p><p>There is an older thread about this; the pwc modules used to show up in the menus but didn&#039;t build.&nbsp; I found out to &quot;make kernel_menuconfig&quot; and turn it on there, and all was well.</p><p>But now I upgraded to the latest SVN trunk and things seem hosed.&nbsp; If I turn things on in the kernel configs the modules get built, but they aren&#039;t packaged up.</p><p>Hopefully someday all the magic behind these things will be documented.&nbsp; . . . .</p>									</div>
