					<p>Hello all.</p><p>I am trying to set a one hop communication using gateworks laguna board where every board has two wifi cards. One wifi card will work as an access point and other one will will be use for hopping and i created a bridge between two boards. I set the IP of those boards 192.168.0.21 and 192.168.0.22(private network). now when I powered on the devices I can see the associated devices which means they can see each other. But when am trying to ping from 192.168.0.21 to 192.168.0.22 its not pinging and shows all packets are lost. </p><p>Is there any one who could suggest me that how could I resolve the issue?As far I am very new to this networking section it would be better if anyone guide me through.</p>									</div>

					<p>You will probably not get answers to such specific issues with your network on this forum. Best solution is to hire some local networking expert so he can help you out.</p>									</div>
