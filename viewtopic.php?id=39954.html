					<p>Since yesterday I set up OpenWRT Backfire on my TP-link wr1043nd and I am really enjoying it so far!</p><p>I configured a PPPoE connection on the WAN interface, which connects through a modem that&#039;s set up in front of it, which works perfectly fine and stable (so far). The only issue I have is in configuring OpenWRT to use custom DNS servers instead of the ones provided by my ISP. My goal is to be able to watch Netflix from abroad, by using the DNS servers provided by Unotelly.com.</p><p>I have tried this in the Luci interface by going to Network &gt; LAN and by filling out the IP address in the &#039;use custom DNS servers&#039; field. This doesn&#039;t really seems to work, though. I am still able to surf the internet, so I presume I&#039;m still connecting through my ISP&#039;s DNS&#039;s.</p><p>Can anyone help me resolve this issue?<br />I have a feeling I&#039;m missing something really simple ...</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for your response, jow!</p><p>The option was a little bit hidden. Had to uncheck the &#039;Use DNS servers advertised by peer&#039; option first. I think this&#039;ll solve the issue. I&#039;m going to test right away ...</p><p>EDIT: in the meanwhile I&#039;ve tested the new config and it seems to work now. Thanks again!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MicroFi</strong> on 16 Oct 2012, 22:05)</p>
