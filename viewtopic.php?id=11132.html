					<p>I&#039;m sorry but I looked everywhere and am unsure about this:<br />Is there any particular bonus if you go from RC6 to the new Kamikaze? Aside from the 10000 writes issue being improved, I&#039;m not certain if the new FW is better for a WRTG/WRTGS or not. I read the milestones and it appears to list only a broadening of the compatible hardware (which is wicked!). </p><p>I&#039;d be willing to learn the new Kamikaze conf setup if it offers more reliability/packages, but should one otherwise just wait until they buy the non-draft N Gigabyte switch that Kamikaze is going to support later?</p>									</div>

					<p>One of the advantages of Kamikaze is that it has the latest Broadcom drivers.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been running Kamikaze about a week on a WRT54GL v1 and it seems to have eliminated the annoying wireless drops that I was experiencing on a Windows XP system.&nbsp; The down side is that there doesn&#039;t seem to be a way to adjust the transmit power at this time (maybe it will be included in a later build).&nbsp; If you decide to try it out, make sure you use the brcm-2.4 build.</p>									</div>
