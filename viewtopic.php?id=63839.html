					<p>Hi, my router (should be a v1 model) has been experiencing wifi problem occasionally which needs a reboot and I would like to give it a try using OpenWrt. However I have never used OpenWrt before and could someone point me to a start?</p><p>The firmware was flashed to the latest one quite some time ago and it states:<br />Firmware Version: &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.13.15 Build 140319 Rel.41339n<br />Hardware Version: &nbsp; &nbsp; WR1043ND v1 00000000</p><p>Do I need to downgrade the uboot first as stated on the wiki? I would like to get a web administration interface with following features:</p><ul><li><p>ports forwarding</p></li><li><p>firewall</p></li><li><p>unPnP (for xbox)</p></li><li><p>proxy/url rewrite (would like to use SSL from Internet to access the cheap ipcams which do not support SSL)</p></li><li><p>SMB (samba?) for file sharing using USB HD</p></li></ul><p>Do I need to install extra packages after flashing OpenWrt?</p>									</div>
