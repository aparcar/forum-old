					<p>Merry Christmas...</p><p>I&#039;ve built something that might interest a few people here. It&#039;s called &quot;<strong>pinapl</strong>&quot; (pronounced &quot;pineapple&quot;) and it&#039;s a library to make good-looking applications for a small and cheap 320x240 touch screen made by 4D-systems. All you need is a device with a 3.3 or 5 volt serial port than can run Lua.</p><p>Please check out github.com/ropg/pinapl</p><p>I&#039;d be happy to hear what you think about it.</p><br /><p>Kind Regards,</p><p>Rop</p>									</div>
