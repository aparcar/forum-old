					<p>Hello, we have a router with same exact specs as the ASUS RT-N13U<br />In fact, it is actually working with that firmware with DD-WRT and it is working</p><p>We are looking to get openwrt working with this router with a simple wizard as we think this is better for the long run than DD-WRT</p><p>Backfire looks very promising.</p><p>We are looking for a customize GUI with a simple wizard that will run and allow the users to either select Cable/DSL or 3G stick<br />when they select the 3G option, they will then be able to select either EVDO (NO SIM) or UMTS (with SIM) or even better, if there is an auto detect,<br />that would be easier.</p><p>They will also have the option to set the wireless security type and password</p><p>that is all we need to run in the wizard (want to make it simple for anyone to set up)</p><p>We would like to have the ability to add additional 3G stick support as we have many sticks to add that may not be working currently.</p><br /><p>We are looking to have these features implement:</p><p>1) Stable firmware that will not need a reboot for at least 1 month<br />2) Full 3G support<br />3) Remote management<br />4) VPN server<br />5) Fail safe (if preferred connection fails, the other type should kick in, cable/dsl or 3G)<br />6) Access point and repeater function</p><p>If you are willing to give this a try and assist, send email to: mofinetwork@gmail.com<br />We will provide the hardware free and if you have any damaged, we will replace free of change</p><p>(all we ask before is to email us your experience with WRT and it would be great if we can get a bunch of users working on the same project, like a true open source project where we are all able to assist)</p><p>Our router are very popular in Canada and we are looking at openwrt to be installed as the original firmware and I know there are many of you that have the ability necessary to help make this project what we are looking for.</p><p>Our main goal is to have a router that is 100% compatible with all the 3G sticks around the world.<br />Our main market are in Canada and USA but we would like all the sticks made to be compatible with the router.</p><p>Also, after this is done, we would like to look into getting the iphone tethering working with the router as well as most of the popular phones on the market.</p><br /><p>Here are the specs of the router:</p><br /><p>CPU speed: 380 MHz<br />3.0 HARDWARE<br />3.1 Key Chipset<br />• Ralink RT3052F Network Processor + WLAN Controller<br />3.2 Memory<br />• 4MB FlashROM (may be 8MB, have to confirm)<br />• 32MB SDRAM<br />3.3 Power Requirement<br />• Input Power : 12V @ 1A DC<br />• Power Consumption : 12 Watt (max)<br />3.4 Wireless Transmit Power<br />• 802.11b (1 antenna) : 18 +/- 1 dBm<br />• 802.11g (1 antenna) : 17 +/- 1 dBm<br />• 802.11n (2 antenna) : 17 +/- 1 dBm</p>									</div>
