					<p>I just submitted trac ticket# 161 for a minor issue involving webif WRT54gs version 4 upgrades.&nbsp; I have a patch file for webif upgrade.sh which I would like to attach,&nbsp; but can&#039;t see how to do so.&nbsp; Documentation mentions annotation - but I see no option to annotate.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Is it possible to attach a file to a ticket and if so how?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Can I establish a trac account?</p>									</div>

					<p>I also lack for way to add comment or patch to an existing ticket (like in bugzilla).<br />What about statut of an &quot;occasional developer&quot; which would enable us to do that in trac?</p>									</div>

					<p>1. You can&#039;t &quot;register to trac&quot;, every user have to be added with htpasswd.<br />2. The reson for not allowing adding comments and other stuff is that trac only know one ACL rule for this, named &quot;ticket modify&quot;. And that would allow anyone to take, close or reassign tickets.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thaks for response and for all of the great work you developers do.&nbsp; This problem was relatively trivial and fixed the same day.&nbsp; For those a bit more complex it might have been nice to attach a patch file to the ticket initially.&nbsp; Might help the developer expedite fix, though in this case I couldn&#039;t expect it any faster.</p><p>Again, no complaints, nothing but thanks for the quick response and the great product -- just wanted to make sure I was using the bug tracking system properly.</p>									</div>

					<p>maybe mantis would be better for trouble tickets, and just use trac for managing svn.</p><p>end users can sign up for mantis accounts, and you have nice permissions system on what exactly end users are allowed to do. i use it for a number of projects and it&#039;s really nice.</p><p>there aren&#039;t that many open tickets currently, so it wouldn&#039;t be too bad to move.</p>									</div>
