					<p>Hi<br />I&#039;ve been running White Russian on a WRT54G for a couple of years with no problems. A few months ago, I began seeing &quot;Address Not Found&quot; errors when using Firefox. Almost always the solution was to click the Try Again button and the URL would open successfully. Very rarely I had to click Try Again twice. Subsequently I began seeing a similar type error in my email client, and then in other applications that access the internet. I have a small LAN. Some machines are wired, some are wireless. All are seeing this problem. I am now running unattended applications that access the internet and these failures are costing me money.</p><p>My guess is that an application issues a request to convert a domain name into an IP and gets back an error indicating the conversion could not be made. Since it&#039;s happening on all machines and the Lynksys/WhiteRussian is my gateway, I assume the problem is there. Also, I can think of no single change I made on all machines that would cause this to appear everywhere simultaneously. Some machines are running XP, some Vista, one Linux (SuSE).</p><p>I&#039;m a programmer, but not a unix or hardware head. The LAN has been stable for so long I don&#039;t want to mess with it. </p><p>Does anyone agree that the Lynksys/WhiteRussian is the most likely cause of the problem? Should I reinstall WhiteRussian? Reflash the BIOS? Is there a log I can look at that might help me understand what is or is not going on? I appreciate all your ideas. </p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Problem does not appear to be DNS specific. If I google something and click around in the results, sooner or later I get an Address Not Found. Same if I go to Yahoo and just start clicking on links. Same if I click around the WRT forum for a while. Can always recover by clicking Try Again, telling me something is failing intermittantly, but not consistently wrong.</p>									</div>

					<p>Why do you think DNS is *not* important here?</p><p>Every time you click something with a hostname, a lookup occurs.</p><p>If the DNS servers you have listed are sometimes returning quick results and sometimes not returning at all, you will get intermittent works / doesn&#039;t behaviour.</p><p>Go to command-line use the nslookup command repeatedly on hostnames that are giving you problems and see what happens.</p><p>Do more debugging, give more data, you will get better answers from any forum.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK. I looked up the URL of my ISP</p><p>nslookup <a href="http://www.pon.net">www.pon.net</a></p><p>100 times and got 100 identical responses.</p><p>C:\Users\david&gt;nslookup <a href="http://www.pon.net">www.pon.net</a><br />Server:&nbsp; UnKnown<br />Address:&nbsp; 192.168.1.1:53</p><p>Non-authoritative answer:<br />Name:&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://www.pon.net">www.pon.net</a><br />Address:&nbsp; 216.229.98.95</p><p>Then I opened my ISP&#039;s home page in my browser and started randomly clicking links. I happened to get an Address Not Found on the 7th click. That link happened to be to <a href="http://www.teamthree.com">www.teamthree.com</a>. So I went back to the command line and did 100 nslookup on <a href="http://www.teamthree.com">www.teamthree.com</a>. I got the same response each time:</p><p>C:\Users\david&gt;nslookup <a href="http://www.teamthree.com">www.teamthree.com</a><br />Server:&nbsp; UnKnown<br />Address:&nbsp; 192.168.1.1:53</p><p>Non-authoritative answer:<br />Name:&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://www.teamthree.com">www.teamthree.com</a><br />Address:&nbsp; 216.229.98.173</p><p>I did 100 nslookup on 2 other URLs and got consistent results. I didn&#039;t do any additional browser clicking. </p><p>I did all this on one computer. I didn&#039;t try anything on any of the others.</p><p>nslookup appears to be working fine. I don&#039;t know how much it has in common with the way other apps on my machine access the web. I wonder if an Address Not Found makes a log entry that might tell me more about the error. I don&#039;t see anything helpful in the Windows event viewer.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Lots of things could be wrong, may be router maybe not.</p><p>Tried pings to those websites to see if they are intermittently unresponsive?</p><p>Does your un-named ISP do web-caching that might be flaky?</p><p>One way to black-box determine router problem or not would be remove the<br />router from the picture entirely. Connect PC directly to internet connection just<br />make sure your software firewall is on.&nbsp; If problem persists with the PC then<br />it&#039;s not the router.</p>									</div>
