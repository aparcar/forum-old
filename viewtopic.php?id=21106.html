					<p>Hmm, yes, I&#039;ve seen that info in the Wiki before too, bu it differed from my config. On my config, port #0 is the internal networking component, and has no physical port.

					<p>Ok, first off, calm down. Do you have ssh or other access to the device?</p><p>If so, try to undo the changes to the files(s) that were changed.</p><p>You say that the WAN port is an ADSL port? in other words, it takes a phone line jack, and not an ethernet plug?</p><p>Ok, that is probably the problem. Do you have a regular DSL Modem to replace it? If not, how are you getting your Internet? You don&#039;t have to answer that, if you don;&#039;t want to. I&#039;m just curious.</p><p>If you are going to use OpenWRT, I would highly recommend a separate DSL Modem and Router. It&#039;s not required, but it makes things easier. Do some research, find out what routers are supported by OpenWRT, and also have the features you want. Some Routers have USB ports built-in to them, for example. Some have more RAM and/or flash space. Look for on openwrt.org for the &quot;table of hardware&quot;. When you go to purchase a router, pay attention to the Hardware versions, as some routers with the exact same model number can have different hardware chips inside. My WRT54GS, for example, is a version 3. Versions 1-4 are supported by OpenWRT, but later ones are not, as of the last time I checked.</p><p>--Aaron</p>									</div>

					<p>I completely agree with Mac84 as to the procedures to get things back to normal. I want to say this in a way that is not seemingly arrogant, and so I won&#039;t assume that I am right. However, from my understanding, the squashfs is the read-only part, and is already loaded/mounted upon boot-up into failsafe mode. The JFFS or &quot;Journaling Flash File System&quot; is the read-write section that would mount with &quot;mount_root&quot;.</p><p>SquashFS is used, by my understanding, by the Knoppix Live CD project, and many other similar projects, because it is compact, yet loads quickly, with minimal overhead. I digress.</p><p>Follow Mac84&#039;s instructions, and see what you can do. Again, note that running the &quot;firstboot&quot; command is a last resort, and although it will quickly get things working, it will also put you back to the way the router was when you first installed OpenWRT.</p><p>--Aaron.</p>									</div>
