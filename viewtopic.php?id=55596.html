					<p>Hi people,</p><p>I just received my Gl.Inet 6416A and want to flash it with the newest Barrier Breaker 14.07. But when I search for 6416A in the Barrier Breaker repository there is none. I can only find <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-gl-inet-v1-squashfs-factory.bin.">openwrt-ar71xx-generic-gl-inet-v1-squashfs-factory.bin</a> I read something about v1 actually be 6408A. </p><p>Is this correct? is 6416A only supported in Trunk, or can I flash my 6416A with the v1 verison?</p><p>Regards,<br />Time</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Timeless</strong> on 5 Feb 2015, 15:13)</p>

					<p>Just ordered a 6416A and wondered the same thing. Glad to see sysupgrade worked, but how about just using the factory.bin instead? I assume I&#039;d have to force install it as well, or is there some reason it might actually fail? Or might I just end up with 8MB usable instead of the full 16MB? It&#039;s cheap enough I&#039;ll try it and won&#039;t be too bummed if it irreparably bricks, but any insight in advance would be appreciated to prevent any unnecessary stumbles. If nobody knows... I&#039;ll just go for it and report back.</p><p>Thx.</p>									</div>

					<p>Or.. </p><p>... Is there an easy way to just expand the image to 16MB? Seems it&#039;s just filler anyway so... can I just append zeros to the 8MB image until it&#039;s 16252928 bytes to get it to the full size to avoid the image check error... or would that not work?</p><p>Thx.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>knetknight</strong> on 24 Apr 2015, 22:35)</p>

					<p>No reply but I&#039;ll share my results anyway. <br />I can say that the 6416A-v1 image works fine. 15.05.1 is working and all the internal flash is detected.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Timeless</strong> on 11 Apr 2016, 13:55)</p>
