					<p>So I have a no-name chinese router with a BCM4706 I want to experiment with but I have no idea how to flash openwrt on to it!</p><p>I have a serial port attached and can ctrl-C to get to the CFE prompt.&nbsp; From there I have the following commands available:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>CFE&gt; help
Available commands:

show clocks         Show current values of the clocks.
nvram               NVRAM utility.
reboot              Reboot.
flash               Update a flash memory device
batch               Load a batch file into memory and execute it
go                  Verify and boot OS image.
boot                Load an executable file into memory and execute it

help                Obtain help for CFE commands

For more information about a command, enter &#039;help command-name&#039;
*** command status = 0</code></pre></div><p>So I have tried about everything I can think of without any success, and can&#039;t find much documentation.&nbsp; I have a valid/working tftp server up, but issuing the following command just hangs:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>CFE&gt; ifconfig eth0 -addr=192.0168.100.237

					<p>Just off the top of my head.. Since you&#039;re using boot (instead of flash), did you try using a ramdisk image instead of a squashfs image? I&#039;m not sure since I haven&#039;t checked the downloads section (I have a router that isn&#039;t officially supported yet and requires compiling from source).. you might have to compile from source to get the ramdisk image, I know it&#039;s an option when you &#039;make menuconfig&#039;.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks Stevenh for the reply but that particular example I gave was just one example of not getting this thing to do anything.</p><p>However... I have been able to gain access to the root login so I have the following info on this thing:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># cat /proc/partitions
major minor  #blocks  name

  31     0       8192 mtdblock0
  31     1        128 mtdblock1

  31     3        320 mtdblock3
  31     4         64 mtdblock4

					<p>So I suppose that this was just too much of a noob question for anyone to answer... so I&#039;ll post the answer I came up with in case anyone else runs across it.</p><p>To flash openwrt to a generic Broadcom router:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>CFE&gt; flash -noheader &lt;tftp server address&gt;:openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx flash1.trx</code></pre></div><p>And thats really all there is to it.&nbsp; This information is probably somewhere in the wiki but I couldn&#039;t seem to find it.</p>									</div>
