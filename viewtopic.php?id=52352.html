					<div class="quotebox"><cite>eximido wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Those trunk snapshots like you&#039;ve installed are rebuilt every day or two. While most of the packages are compatible between that builds, the packages including kernel modules are intentionally made incompatible for safety. So in order to install openvpn package (which includes a kmod) officially you can only use the package which was built at the same time as the firmware image you have flashed, opkg won&#039;t allow you to install a kmod package built today into openwrt system which was built a couple days ago. So when dealing with trunk you should either download all packages you&#039;re willing to install later at the same time when getting firmware image itself, or... in fact you can ignore that error.<br />If you&#039;re sure that kernel didn&#039;t change between the version you have installed and the current trunk, then you can force opkg to ignore dependencies check. See opkg --help for valid key to do that. In most cases it will work fine. It the worst case you will need to boot into failsafe mod and delete faulty kmod from the system.</p></blockquote></div><p>or flash new firmware image first squashfs-sysupgrade.bin</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>trismo</strong> on 25 Aug 2014, 10:45)</p>
