					<p>The Subject line says it all!&nbsp; I upgraded my Netgear WGT634U to Backfire 10.03.1 and reinstalled mpd, but now...<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># mpd
mpd: can&#039;t resolve symbol &#039;g_malloc_n&#039; in lib &#039;mpd&#039;.</code></pre></div><p>Sadly, I think this may relate to my having many packages installed on external storage - it looks as if &quot;opkg upgrade&quot; doesn&#039;t always know that a package needs upgrading! So, I used &quot;--force-reinstall&quot; on most of the libraries listed as dependencies for mpd - I did *not* reinstall glib2 or libpthread, as those are marked essential to OpenWRT. Same results as above.</p><p>Where is g_malloc_n? Google searches haven&#039;t helped identify which library might be the cause - the most useful result was relating to Ubuntu and Titanium, which doesn&#039;t quite apply here. Now what?</p>									</div>
