					<p>I would like to restrict users on my lan when my usage begins to aaproach the allowed limit&nbsp; 25 gB per month. With Tomato I had sets of rules I could enable when needed that would prevent certain users from accessing the internet every day between 05:00 and 24:00 local time. It seems to me there might be a fairly common need to do this. Is this already available in a package or plug-in?</p><p>I am using:&nbsp; OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment 12.09 / LuCI 0.11.1 Release (0.11.1) if that matters ...</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Bob</p>									</div>
