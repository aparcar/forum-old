					<p>I&#039;ve been trying to set up my WRT54GL as a routed client using 7.07 (2.4). It works perfectly with the wireless link unsecured, or using wep. However I want to use psk (minimum) or preferably psk2. As soon as I switch from unsecured or wep connection to psk it no longer picks up a dhcp lease from the AP. At each step I&#039;ve verified that my laptop can connect wirelessly to the AP, so there&#039;s no problem there.</p><p>Not being sure exactly which packages were necessary and reading through various forum posts and the wiki, I&#039;ve installed nas, wl, and tried installing wpa-supplicant (but read afterwards that isn&#039;t required).</p><p>I&#039;m now stuck.</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas what I could be missing? If not I guess I&#039;ll have to go with wep, which is insecure.</p><p>Here&#039;s my config:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/etc/config# cat network

					<p>Hi, Matthew.&nbsp; I also had this problem in Kamikaze after digging into it in Whiterussian (where it was never &quot;officailly&quot; fixed).</p><p>I am running perfectly in Whiterussian 0.9, now, after finding the root cause:<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/1732">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/1732</a> &quot;No WPA in Routed Client mode (WR0.9)&quot;</p><p>But this ticket was closed with &quot;Should be fixed in Kamikaze 7.07&quot; but I didn&#039;t see it was fixed, you didn&#039;t see it fixed.</p><p>DID ANYONE SEE IT FIXED?&nbsp; I&#039;ve been watching to confirm it is.&nbsp; All I see is it is not.</p><p>So if anyone wants to track it down and, possibly, confirm it isn&#039;t evolved from the same bug here&#039;s a head start.&nbsp; I&#039;ll stay with Whiterussian 0.9 and my unofficial fix, thank you.&nbsp; My gut feeling is it&#039;s still the same bug with a new cocoon <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Bill_MI</strong> on 14 Sep 2007, 04:53)</p>
