					<p>TL-WA850RE V2 in particular but I&#039;d imagine they all use the same location in one of the mtds.

					<p>Thanks that&#039;s awesome. There&#039;s no pin but the mac is &quot;18-a6-f7-30-05-a3&quot;. I think you&#039;re correct I wiped it when using the serial to flash it. I&#039;ve a got another one here now waiting for the hammer to crack it open to verify. I&#039;ve tried to compile an image to web install it on the new one but keep getting checksum errors. I&#039;ve successfully done this with other routers so I&#039;ll probably persist with that to save wrecking another one.</p>									</div>
