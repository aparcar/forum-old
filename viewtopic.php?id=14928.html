					<p>After playing a lot on my asus wl500gp router i have managed to break the firmware and had to re-flash the it. Everything went fine, I reconfigured the router as before. The problem is that now I have no dhcp on the wlan interface.</p><p>Dhcp works when I use no encryption and doesn&#039;t work for psk and wep. I have tried both Kamikaze 7.07 and 7.09. I have also tried flushing the entire nvram without any success. (nvram unset ...)</p><p>Any help/idea where to look further is appreciated.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# cat /etc/config/wireless
