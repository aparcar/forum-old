					<p>Hey All;</p><p> I&#039;ve got an ixp4xx OpenWRT based system that has a 2.6.21.7&nbsp; and a 2.6.26.5 kernel installed.&nbsp; <br /> Ran some performance tests with the device set simply to bridge packets, <br /> and I&#039;m having some trouble interpreting the results with respect to small sized frames.</p><p>For the 2.6.26.5 kernel the fps bridging of 64 byte frames was 45,620 fps <br />For the 2.6..21.7 kernel the fps bridging of 64 byte frames was 71,839 fps.</p><p>This was measured on a Smartbits 6000 unit so it&#039;s pretty accurate.</p><p>Now, I&#039;m trying to diagnose the cause of the performance difference.<br />There was a driver switch between 2.6.21.7 and 2.6.26.5,&nbsp; <br />yet I&#039;ve looked at IRQ settings,&nbsp; NAPI settings, and both drivers seem very similar.</p><p>Has anyone else noticed lower performance rates for small sized frames ?</p><p>GPW</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey All;</p><p>How would one verify that the NAPI settings are actually operational in the driver on the 2.6.26.5 kernel ?<br />I have not been able to find the cause of the performance drop yet, so I&#039;m grasping at straws.</p><p>GPW</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve just looked into this.<br />Comparing 2.6.28.10 with 2.6.21.7&nbsp; at 128b frames<br />2.6.28.10 was able to do only 29,000 frames a second<br />2.6.21.7&nbsp; was able to do 46,000 frames a second</p><p>Network setup;&nbsp; bridging eth0 and eth1 .&nbsp; All default settings for the stack.</p><p>Don&#039;t have any ideas at the moment, other than go back to the older kernel if the small frame performance is lower than was your system can tolerate.</p><p>It does look like there is a small frame performance issue.</p><p>Cheers<br />DSL</p>									</div>
