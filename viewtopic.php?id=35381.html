					<p>Hi. I would like to set up my home wifi network using the 5Ghz band. Unfortunately, I&#039;m afraid the range will not suffice for one of the rooms without some form of extender. I was reading up on &quot;repeater bridge&quot; mode with dd-wrt, but I&#039;m unsure if it would do what I want, plus the equipment I want isn&#039;t supported with dd, but is with open.&nbsp; Does OpenWrt support a configuration for what&#039;s listed below?</p><p>I would have 4 of the same hardware. One would be main AP, two would be wireless bridges for two wired segments, and another would be the repeater.</p><p>I have uploaded a quick general diagram of what I want to do. My concern is that the wireless repeater bridge will not act as both a client and an AP.</p><br /><p>If someone can please take a look at the diagram I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks! </p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i165.photobucket.com/albums/u50/p0wder2/PossibleHomeNetDesign-General.jpg" alt="http://i165.photobucket.com/albums/u50/p0wder2/PossibleHomeNetDesign-General.jpg" /></span></p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the reply!&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking WDS may not be the correct method to use as I have read that it would cut the throughput in half.&nbsp; Although, now that I think about it, I guess having one of the AP&#039;s acting as a repeater bridge would do the same for the segment it is bridging.&nbsp; But, at least it wouldn&#039;t affect the throughput of devices on the other segment(s).&nbsp; Please correct me if I&#039;m wrong.</p>									</div>

					<p>Why do you think your client bridge / repeater bridge / ap / client bridge plan will perform better?<br />The &quot;omg WDS cuts bandwidth in half&quot; myth is nonesense - simple truth is that any multi network config on one radio on the same channel will &quot;cut the throughput in half&quot;, substituting a somewhat clean WDS config with multi-layered ARP manipulation crazyness will not improve the situation.</p>									</div>

					<p>EDIT:&nbsp; I&nbsp; apologize for the post relating the throughput cuts when comparing WDS and Repeater Bridge.&nbsp; I really should have done a bit more research into how the two actually work instead of just regurgitating something I read.</p><p>However, now that I have done some more research, I would like to confirm my grasp on where the throughput loss actually is:</p><p>The loss in throughput when using WDS would only occur when there is an extra wireless hop in the network.&nbsp; So, even though WDS is configured on all APs, if one AP is connecting directly to another with only one wireless hop, then there would not actually be any loss in throughput.&nbsp; Therefore, with the setup I diagrammed, only the segment connecting through my &quot;range extender&quot; (the segment on the far left of the diagram which is the far room that requires more range) would experience a loss in throughput while the rest of the network would not.&nbsp; Please let me know if this is correct.</p><p>Also, I am now considering using the Repeater Bridge method to try and constrain the throughput loss by using a simultaneous dual band router as the &quot;range extender&quot; and linking one radio to the main AP and the other radio to the far room network segment (someone else brought it up as an option...I&#039;m apparently not that clever).&nbsp; Would it be possible to do this with WDS or would I have to use the Repeater Bridge method?</p><p>Thanks again for all the help!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>powder21</strong> on 11 Mar 2012, 07:54)</p>

					<p>Powder21, did you ever get this working? I&quot;m trying to do the same thing with no luck. The link from FYI is pretty sparse (if I get this working I&#039;ll go back and fill it out).</p><p>If you had success, could you post your config files?

					<p>In any way you extend a signal by using a single radio interface, you will half the bandwidth.<br />You can do as much repeater bridges as you want without having troubles, just ensure a good signal of about between them, and you will have a nice network.<br />Just, if the band allows 300Mbits(for example) , all the repeater will be working at the half of it(150Mbits each side).<br />Its not a drama! Check my post here,https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39077 you need the config #1.<br />For me, a good signal than ensure a high data rate and long range between routers is about -63dB or more, but do the test yourself for checking the performance at different levels.</p><p>For doing just bridged wireless client, without repeater, delete the second interface in the wireless config, in &quot;ap&quot; mode.<br />That way the wireless will use its full bandwidth as client.<br />In this case, in your picture, the right devices will work at full bandwidth, while the left ones would do at half.</p><p>But, unless you have a 100Mbit internet connection, I thing the loss would be small.<br />Considering that the cheapest routers run at 150Mbit, leaving half each side, could give 50-60Mbit of real bandwidth, which is still very good.<br />And you have better ones, capable of 300 and 600Mbit...</p><p>What router will you get? I recommend and atheros based, as OpenWrt has excellent support for it.<br />I could help a bit with the configs also.</p><p>In case you want 100% of bandwith in repeater mode, you could use a router with two wireless card, or buy a router with USB and plug an USB wireless card working as client, while the router works as AP. Of course you need a wireless card that is supported by OpenWrt.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dabyd64</strong> on 7 Sep 2012, 01:59)</p>

					<p>Thanks dabyd64, that did exactly what I wanted. I almost got that set up from another wiki page (I had already built &amp; installed relayd), but the page was designed to connect ethernet-&gt;wifi-&gt;ethernet. What I wanted - and now have working :-) was wifi-&gt;wifi-&gt;wifi. </p><p>Thanks again - you rock!</p><p>-S-</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah the wireless bridge being wireless&lt;&lt;---&gt;&gt;openwrt router&lt;&lt;---&gt;&gt;LAN+WIRELESS is confusing in the wiki.<br />I had a hard starting too.
