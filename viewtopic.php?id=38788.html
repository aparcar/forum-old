					<p>There is a lot of scattered info about this but I couldn&#039;t use any of it..</p><p>What&#039;s the proper way of mounting an USB stick at startup (with custom options) and then running a command from it?</p><p>I currently can do both those things manually. I tried writing the mount line into /etc/rc.local via the UI but it doesn&#039;t work. What&#039;s strange is that the USB is already mounted (but not like I want i.e. with -o sync) despite the fact that I didn&#039;t setup any mount points in the UI and /etc/config/fstab is vanilla.</p><p>Running Backfire 10.03.1 on a TP Link MR3420.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
