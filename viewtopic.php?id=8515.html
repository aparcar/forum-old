					<p>Generally you have to go through the same pain and hassle as the rest of us <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p><p>It&#039;s also because AR7 images are based on Kamikaze which is in testing at the moment. It&#039;s also to protect people who don&#039;t know what they&#039;re doing from destroying their routers.</p><p>The documentation has loads of info. I got it running on my DSL-502T ... not to keep posting this but <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/D-Link/DSL-502T">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har â€¦ k/DSL-502T</a> have a read it might help you a little.</p>									</div>
