					<p>Let&#039;s start at the beginning: Which OpenWrt release did you install, or asked differently: What is the name of the firmware file that you installed?</p><p>OpenWrt 2.0 does not exist.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you put the wrong build on it thin it is bricked first check if the DHCP is working by looking at your PC IP if it is 192.168.1.XX in that range you might be ok TEL-NET into it if you can,&nbsp; ALL builds I flashed looks something like this ( openwrt-15.05.1-ar71xx-generic-tl-wa830re-v1-squashfs-factory.bin )If yours is a V1 thin this is the file you should have flashed it with. If you don&#039;t get an IP from the DHCP on the router thin your PC will give it its own IP which could be anything, Thin try failsafe if that don&#039;t work Thin I&#039;m sorry your device is bricked.Read the WIKI might help you recover from the bad flash.</p><p>OR be sure your lan is turned on on your PC lapTop and turn the wireless off whin you are configuring with a CAT-5 cable.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ckm</strong> on 10 Jan 2017, 04:39)</p>

					<p>I might be wrong but i think your lan in your lapTop PC is not working if your desktop gets a IP and your lapTop does not and you get a IP from the OS on the lapTop and you can&#039;t log into it, either the cable is bad or the lan is bad to take a look at your device manager and see if everything is ok.You are not getting a IP from the the DHCP server that is the first thing you need to get your setup to work.</p>									</div>
