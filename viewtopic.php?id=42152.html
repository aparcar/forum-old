					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;m a newbie to OpenWRT and stuff. I have a TP-Link TL-MR3220 v1.2 Router that has been flashed with <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09-beta/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-mr3220-v1-squashfs-factory.bin"> the image</a> gotten from <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-mr3420#installation"> here</a> with the Luci Web Interface.</p><p>I would like to use my router to wirelessly connect to an existing WiFi connection which is a WPA2 connection and I&#039;ve no access to the Cisco router from where it originates. </p><p>Once my tp-link router can connect to the existing wifi connection, I would like to connect to the tp-link router via WiFi and LAN to connect to the main internet connection from the Cisco router.</p><p>I&#039;m kinda lost with the huge documentation etc so I request someone to please help me with guiding me on how exactly it should be done. </p><p>I&#039;ve tried on the stock non-OpenWRT firmware of my router to use WDS bridging as per instructions <a href="http://blog.jeffcosta.com/2011/09/29/create-a-wireless-n-bridge-with-2-inexpensive-tp-link-routers/"> here.</a> However after the final step of rebooting the router can&#039;t be connected to either via LAN or Wifi. When DHCP wasn&#039;t disabled, after a reboot I could connect to the TP-Link but it had no internet connectivity while disabling DHCP left me locked out.</p><p>Thanks in advance for all the help!</p><br /><p>P.S. If I want to install any packages on the TP-Link router via opkg how do I get it connected to an WiFi connection for it to get internet connectivity? Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>anonshe</strong> on 6 Feb 2013, 08:50)</p>
