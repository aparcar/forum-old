					<p>Way overkill, IMHO. Just create a second &quot;server&quot; with uhttpd that comes with LuCI anyway (create a second config section, point it to a different directory than /www, bind it to a port other than the default) and open the port to the outside in the firewall settings. Viola, wuala, &lt;insert your favorite misspelling of &quot;voil√†&quot; here&gt;!</p><p>That being said, what&#039;s the point really? OpenWrt by default answers to pings from the outside. And that&#039;s what pings are for.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 15 Jul 2015, 04:10)</p>
