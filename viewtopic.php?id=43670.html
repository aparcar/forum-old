					<p>Hey guys I have a bricked WNR2000 V1 that was previously running White Russian here that I am wanting to flash back to stock firmware. I have an interactive serial console via USB to UART converter. I&#039;ve tried a method using TFTP but it would not work no matter what I did or what guide I followed to the letter. I even experimented myself and tried to use &#039;loady&#039; and then send the firmware file using YMODEM in my serial client. </p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p><p>Many thanks <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
