					<p>I am new to OpenWRT, though not to custom firmwares for my routers.&nbsp; I noticed that my router, a Linksys E4200v2, is finally supported by OpenWRT, so I installed the latest trunk build (r49390) and got everything up and running.&nbsp; I also installed LuCI and have been using that for most of the setup.&nbsp; I am having troubles with one thing though, and that is port forwarding.</p><p>I have two ports forwarded, one for Vuze, and one for OpenVPN, my server is still running inside my network, and it will be a bit before I move it to OpenWRT.&nbsp; I first set up the rule for Vuze, forwarding both TCP and UDP to my laptop, all the tests passed fine.&nbsp; I then setup the OpenVPN rule, forwarding UDP port 1194 to my desktop.&nbsp; But I couldn&#039;t connect to it from outside my LAN.&nbsp; Everything looked good, and I couldn&#039;t figure out what was wrong until I used the arrows by the rules to change the order, putting OpenVPN on top.&nbsp; Then I could connect, but the UDP portion of the Vuze rule quit working, while the TCP port was unaffected.&nbsp; Moving them back to the other order makes Vuze UDP work and OpenVPN quit again.</p><p>So it appears only the top rule for UDP is actually working.&nbsp; Any ideas what could be wrong?&nbsp; Odds are it is something I am doing, but I&#039;m not sure what.&nbsp; It could also be a bug, I am running trunk because it is the only way my router is truly supported.&nbsp; I can provide more information if needed.</p>									</div>
