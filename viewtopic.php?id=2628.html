					<p>It may be easier to use mtd to make a clone image of your first router, then restore it on each of your other 19 routers.&nbsp; You can backup the linux and nvram partitions on the first, then write them to each of the remaining routers.&nbsp; Search the forum for MTD...</p><p>Just dont forget to change the MAC address for your interfaces after you restore...</p><br /><p>This will save you from having to figure out how to change the default nvram variables in your CFE.&nbsp; From what I understand, OpenWRT doesn&#039;t support writing the CFE any longer.&nbsp; </p><p>Did you have problems patching your kernel for ebtables with the above patch?&nbsp; I have used it before with no problems...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>netprince</strong> on 15 Sep 2005, 21:10)</p>
