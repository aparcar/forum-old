					<p>4300 works great.<br />If you want something even better, tplink archer c7 v2 -- make sure its a v2 though, since v1 has a defective/obsolete/unsupported wifi card.</p>									</div>

					<p>&quot;I have concerns regarding the compatibility with OpenWRT&quot;<br />Huh?<br />I just told you what works.<br />If you really want to buy a new router in a few weeks when you realize that you DO want AC, then by all means -- your choice.<br />But it isn&#039;t just the AC that makes the C7 a much better choice. It also has a faster CPU and *TWICE* the flash memory.</p>									</div>

I wont be loading packages (one or two may be) so i doubt that i will notice a difference.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>neohidra</strong> on 29 Apr 2014, 08:25)</p>

					<p>The reason I asked you such a question is because your remarks on the USB port. I was under an impression you will be using this router as a Linux embedded device due to the existence of a USB port. If that is the case, then you can probably find some inexpensive Android miniPC from China and start hacking it to run OpenWRT.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve been using the Netgear WNDR3800.&nbsp; I bought a refurb on Newegg for about $70 CDN.</p><p>It works like a charm.&nbsp; So far, no lock ups.&nbsp; It has speed to spare, for my purposes.&nbsp; I have a 100Mb/s FibreOp link from Bell Aliant.&nbsp; It has had no problem operating at full bandwidth with connection tracking and QOS configured.&nbsp; &nbsp;Both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz wifi have been rock solid.&nbsp; USB is fine too, though, I only ran it through its paces, with a high load, long enough to make sure the router was fully working.</p><p>Jon</p>									</div>
