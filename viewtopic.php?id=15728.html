CONFIG_GPIO_DEVICE=y</code></pre></div><p>in your kernel .config file (under trunk/build_dir/linux*/linux-*/)<br />If there are not there, run<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>make kernel_menuconfig</code></pre></div><p>and enable Device Drivers / GPIO Support / GPIO device support.<br />AFAIK the changes by the above make only last until the next <strong>make clean</strong> is executed.</p>									</div>
