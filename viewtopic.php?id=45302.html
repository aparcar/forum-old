					<p>Hello.</p><p>I am trying to learn the process of how various cross toolchains are built. For what I saw from those Makefiles, gcc/final was built by host GCC installation (and cross-binutils built by the host), thus should not depend on gcc/minimal or gcc/initial. Also, gcc/final should be capable of whatever the other variants can do. So why not just build gcc/final? Or, why gcc/minimal and gcc/initial are necessary?</p>									</div>

If gcc/final can be built without uClibc, can we get it just like gcc/intial and use it to build uClibc?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>yousong</strong> on 17 Jul 2013, 15:18)</p>

					<p>Yes the final compiler depends on a specific C runtime/stadnard library which is tied into the final gcc distribution in such a way that you cannot simply add it later, therfore you need a dedicated gcc build which was compiled with uClibc included so that it can emit proper uclibc using binaries.</p><p>Maybe this basic procedure here helps to understand the steps: <a href="http://www.jimscode.ca/index.php/component/content/article/19-linux/37-linux-building-gcc-with-uclibc-for-xscale">http://www.jimscode.ca/index.php/compon … for-xscale</a> - its just a hit I found after a quick google search.</p>									</div>

Cross-lfs uses a 2-stage compilation to build a complete gcc cross compilation. I think their &quot;GCC with no Lib C&quot; corresponds to gcc/minimal here.

					<p>Hi, jow.</p><p>Without gcc/intial, the whole toolchain (binutils, gcc, uClibc) compiled fine. I see from the original design that gcc/intial needs uClibc/headers installed by gcc/minimal, then uClibc is compiled with gcc/initial. But actually uClibc can be compiled with gcc/minimal.</p><p>Hmm, I guess there exists dependency handling nastiness I am not yet aware of.</p><p>Thank you, jow, for the guidance.</p>									</div>
