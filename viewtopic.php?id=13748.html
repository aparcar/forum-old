					<p>Hi All</p><p>After a couple of attempts, I have finally found a simple traffic counting solution. Basically, I count the traffic between the internet and each internal lan ip, and save it to a database running on another machine <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>I add some rules into iptables - two for each internal ip - one for each direction. I added these rules into /etc/firewall.user :</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -t mangle -A FORWARD -s 192.168.0.2
iptables -t mangle -A FORWARD -d 192.168.0.2

iptables -t mangle -A FORWARD -s 192.168.0.3
iptables -t mangle -A FORWARD -d 192.168.0.3

iptables -t mangle -A FORWARD -d 192.168.0.4
iptables -t mangle -A FORWARD -s 192.168.0.4</code></pre></div><p>Then, I use a script to extract the iptables counter information, and insert it into a database (I use postgres). This is run by a cron job every 5 minutes : </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

# get the data, and zero the counters
iptables -nvx -t mangle -L -Z FORWARD | grep &quot;all&quot; &gt; /tmp/datadump



cat /tmp/datadump | while read line;
do
        # work out the direction
        seventhfield=$(echo &quot;${line}&quot; | awk &#039;{print $7}&#039;)
        if [ $seventhfield != &quot;0.0.0.0/0&quot; ]; then
                #the direction is outbound from the ip in the seventh field
                direction=&#039;out&#039;
                ip=$seventhfield
        fi

        eighthfield=$(echo &quot;${line}&quot; | awk &#039;{print $8}&#039;)
        if [ $eighthfield != &quot;0.0.0.0/0&quot; ]; then
                #the direction is inbound to the ip in the eighth field
                direction=&#039;in&#039;
                ip=$eighthfield
        fi

        #work out the bytes
        bytes=$(echo &quot;${line}&quot; | awk &#039;{print $2}&#039;)

        statement=&quot;insert into dump (bytes, direction, ip) values ($bytes,&#039;$direction&#039;,&#039;$ip&#039;)&quot;
        #echo $statement
        psql -h 192.168.0.3 -U postgres -c &quot;$statement&quot; traffic
done</code></pre></div><p>and the cronjob in /etc/crontabs/root<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>*/5 * * * * /bin/processtraffic &gt; /tmp/ptlog</code></pre></div><p>That&#039;s all for the wrt side.</p><p>Now, on my other machine which is running the database, I used this table definition : </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>create sequence dump_sequence;

create table dump(
  id int not null default nextval(&#039;dump_sequence&#039;) primary key,
  time timestamp default current_timestamp,
  bytes int,
  ip varchar(15),
  direction varchar(3));</code></pre></div><p>I have a simple cgi script that pulls the data and displays it in a browser. psql has a neato option to spit out the result set in html <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /> The cgi script has input fields so that one can enter a date range as well.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/bash

echo &quot;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;</code></pre></div><p>This little scheme does have a couple of problems how ever.</p><p>1: The ip&#039;s are hardcoded. <br />I use dhcp to give out the ips by mac address, so I know which computer is which, and its unlikely that another computer will join often, but still it offends my inner programmer.... I have to store them in the firewall.user file, and in the HTML if I want the host name to show! I could perform a host lookup on the ip, and insert the hostname into the database along with the ip and traiific information maybe.... <br />I could maybe manage the iptables rules by somehow adding when a new dhcp lease is handed out, or expires, but I am unsure how to do that. It would increase maintainability though <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>2: firewall.user does not appear to get run on reboot.<br />The last time I tried this, when I rebooted the router the rules where not present in iptables!</p><p>3: Kernel memory usage per rule, and performance.<br />I simply don&#039;t know how many rules is too many - is it 10, is it 100? Will 10 rules add latency? I haven&#039;t noticed any.... </p><p>4: The cgi script is vulnerable to sql injection.<br />One could enter </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>; drop table dump ;</code></pre></div><p>into either of the input fields on the web page. I am a little too lazy to fix this, but I think a simple regex stripping out any &quot;;&quot; characters would do it.</p><p>5: The 5 minute interval could be too short.<br />Hopefully, even at full throttle, the 5 minute cron job is long enough to capture the counter data before the counters reset to zero.</p><p>So yeah. Any ideas on how to make any of this a bit more graceful? Probably the ip management and capture script needs the most work! But, for a small home network in my flat, I think its fine <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
