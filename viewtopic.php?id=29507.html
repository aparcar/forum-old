					<p>EDIT: problem solved without opening the router! See <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=133829#p133829">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 29#p133829</a><br />--</p><p>First of all let me congratulate for the really great community around this project.</p><p>Then let me say that I&#039;m a retarded n00b <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>I&#039;m a complete newbie about Openwrt, but I decided to buy this router and test it. I tried to flash it with the image found at:</p><p><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1-rc4/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-tl-wr1043nd-v1-squashfs-factory.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … actory.bin</a></p><p>as from instructions, and it worked (web interface LUCI a little buggy, though). BUT, since I&#039;m an idiot, I couldn&#039;t resist trying to build my own image with the procedure at:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtain.firmware.generate">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtai … e.generate</a></p><p>After the flashing procedure, the router is, OF COURSE, dead. I tried to reset it and the generic failsafe procedure, both failed. Now if I turn on the router, the SYS led keeps blinking, but I cannot access it anymore through the network interface.</p><p>I gave a look at the unbricking procedure and searched on the forum, and I&#039;ve found a TON of stuff to read. Being a novice, all this results in an overwhelming amount of information to handle.</p><p>Begging: could please someone give me some direction to start with? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> I promise I will be more careful next time, but I really cannot afford right now to read all that stuff in a single time!</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gaglia</strong> on 23 Apr 2011, 11:08)</p>

					<p>Are you sure it is really bricked ?<br />Try setting a static IP address on your PC - say 192.168.1.2&nbsp; and see if you can ping 192.168.1.1.&nbsp; &nbsp;If the ping works - you can try to telnet to 192.168.1.1</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks everybody for the help and sorry for my late reply, I am not complaining for too much information, but for the lack of time to read all those interesting instructions <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> anyway now I have some more time to play with the router and made some test.</p><p>@snowyowlster: you&#039;re right! I can access the router via telnet in failsafe mode:<br /> - I set up a &quot;test&quot; cable connection with IP 192.168.1.2, gateway 192.168.1.1 and mask 255.255.255.0<br /> - I turn on the router and wait for the SYS light to start blinking<br /> - then I push the QSS button and hold it until the SYS light starts to blink faster<br /> - at this point I plug the network cable from LAN port 1 to my pc and ifconfig the test connection<br /> - now i can telnet to 192.168.1.1</p><p>So it seems that it&#039;s not so brutally bricked after all <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> but since I do not want to make further mistakes, I&#039;d like to ask you what to do now to restore the original firmware (I kept a copy) or the default openwrt image. I will think in a second moment on how to build a personalized image.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>1043 can only recover by serial if really brick, you better get a serial cable first, cause the offical firmware can be brick also. at least mind did<br />next time better to get a router with tftp recover enable</p>									</div>

					<p>Solved without opening the router! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /> (can please a mod add a [SOLVED] tag in the title? I couldn&#039;t find a way to do it by myself)</p><p>This is what I did (step-by-step howto for possible n00bs coming after me <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /> ):</p><p> - set up a &quot;test&quot; wired connection on my pc, with static IP 192.168.1.2, gateway 192.168.1.1, netmask 255.255.255.0<br /> - set up an ftp server on my pc with guest login without password (proftpd), listening on 192.168.1.2<br /> - put new firmware in the guest ftp shared folder (newfirmware.bin)<br /> - booted the router in failsafe mode<br /> - plugged network cables<br /> - telnet 192.168.1.1<br /> - checked at least 12-13 MiB free RAM with &quot;free&quot; and at least 8 MiB free space on /swap with &quot;df&quot;<br /> - cd /tmp<br /> - wget ftp://guest@192.168.1.2/newfirmware.bin<br /> - mtd -r write newfirmware.bin firmware<br /> - wait for reboot AND some further seconds after reboot</p><p>As a new firmware image I used:</p><p><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1-rc4/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-tl-wr1043nd-v1-squashfs-factory.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … actory.bin</a></p><p>as from instructions and it worked. But then I decided to try the bleeding edge at:</p><p><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr1043nd-v1-squashfs-factory.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … actory.bin</a></p><p>and I must say I&#039;m pretty satisfied with it! Note that this last one is shipped without LUCi, so there is no graphical web interface at first, but you can install it:</p><p> - telnet 192.168.1.1<br /> - opkg update<br /> - opkg install luci<br /> - /etc/init.d/uhttpd enable<br /> - /etc/init.d/uhttpd start</p><p>remember to save a backup of the configuration, because if you have to reset the router you lose the web interface again. I definitely prefer this firmware because it is already shipped with the wifi modules kmod-ath9k and wpad-mini, which the stable backfire lacks (see <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd#installation">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl- … stallation</a> ), moreover the full LUCi web interface is DEFINITELY better than the basic one shipped in the stable.</p><p>As a last step, I&#039;d like very much to build an image, starting from the bleeding edge but adding some package (luci and some others), but I couldn&#039;t find an image builder for the bleeding edge, and however, seen my previous experience, I doubt I will do it without first being properly adviced by someone more expert than me <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p><p>Volunteers in giving me some step-by-step advice? &lt;_&lt;</p><p>Thanks for the help already provided! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gaglia</strong> on 23 Apr 2011, 11:10)</p>

					<p>Sorry guy, but you weren&#039;t bricked. You must have been soft bricked, or just locked up some how. Your fix does nothing for my Bricked TL-1043ND. The serial cable fix is truly my only hope. My hardware isn&#039;t recognized by ANY connection, WAN or LAN. It just sits there with a steadily lit power light, and all the others blinking on and off, on and off. Back on the shelf it goes, I&#039;ll serial cable it one of these days.</p>									</div>
