					<p>D-link just released a mini router to allow a mobile devices like smartphone or ipad with free Shareport app to access an USB stick or portable hard disk. Unfortunately the USB port is not able to power some of the portable hard disks that drain fair amount of current. </p><p>DIR-505 uses a 5-pin current limiter chip to regulate the maximum allowed output current to USB port. To remove this limitation, a quick and dirty way is to lift the output pin of this chip then short the 5V power supply directly to the USB power pin. But make sure you will not able to use the USB port as a power charger any more due to the removal of the current limiter.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have disassembled the dir-505 and would like to perform this modification. Is the current limiter chip the one marked &quot;to-505&quot;?</p>									</div>
