					<p>Yes. I tried putting behind STA. If I transfer UDP packets, it is successfully transmitted. But in case of TCP packets, No transfer is there, neither to nor from.</p>									</div>

					<p>First of all, you must enable wds to let bridged client (sta) work. Have you tried the latest Backfire 10.03.1-rc4 build? Which mini-PCI card do you have, WMR-300/400/600? What&#039;s the radio chip?</p>									</div>

					<p>Put another system on Satellite via wired cable, check that you can still access the camera.&nbsp; This will make sure that the local network on that end is working correctly, if not, you will need to troubleshoot and fix that first.</p><p>If this works, then there is some issue with your WDS setup, but I don&#039;t have any experience troubleshooting that.</p>									</div>
