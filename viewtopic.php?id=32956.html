					<p>I had to open up my WNDR3700v2 recently (did something stupid and needed serial) and I noticed it&#039;s a bit different than the v1 pictures on the wiki (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3700#antenna.mod">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wnd … ntenna.mod</a>). I initially wasn&#039;t going to bother with the antenna mod because I don&#039;t have the skills/tools to solder SMD components, but it looks like the v2 has normal U.FL connectors for 2 of the 4 antennas.</p><p>Here&#039;s some photos: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/4CHu9">http://imgur.com/a/4CHu9</a></p><p>PJ5 and PJ6 and the same as in the v1 but PJ2 was replace as AJ1 and PJ4 was replaces as AJ2. Also there are two small board antennas stuck to the top of the case and connected to AJ1/2.</p><p>Since they already have antennas connected, I assume it would be OK to attach a U.FL to SMA connector without having to make any modifications? Also, would these be for the 2.4Ghz, 5Ghz or both?</p>									</div>

					<p>Looking at the board it appears that the changes needed to mod the v1 are already made to accommodate the antennas inside the v2, but I don&#039;t know that much about electronics so I was hoping someone could confirm it.</p><p>I think you should be able to get a couple of these <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/662">http://www.sparkfun.com/products/662</a> and then attach whatever antennas you like.</p>									</div>

					<p>You will still have to perform similar steps to v1 if you want to convert the 2.4GHz radio antenna in V2. I can confirm that the 5GHz side already has the proper connection to mod without soldering. There is already someone on eBay selling a 7dbi mod kit for the 5GHz side.</p><p><a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/7dBi-Antenna-Mod-Kit-Netgear-WNDR3700-v-2-Dual-Band-Gigabit-no-soldering-/110752220167">http://www.ebay.com/itm/7dBi-Antenna-Mo … 0752220167</a></p><p>One thing that I wondered about in the v1 mod is that he is using the same antennas for 2.4GHz as he is for&nbsp; 5GHz, which are rated for only 2.4GHz. Would this damage the radio/amps in any way? Any Ham Radio freaks out there? I don&#039;t have an SWR meter for that high of frequency.</p><p>Also, he seems to mention removing the switches. Does this have an impact on anything electronically? Obviously down the circuit somewhere, something must be controlling those puppies.</p><p>Well, I may order a kit from the eBay guy and some extra parts to dabble around a bit with the 2.5GHz side if I can find some straight answers. Unfortunately, I have no use yet for the 5GHz side.</p>									</div>
