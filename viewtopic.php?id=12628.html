					<p>I have 3 meraki minis and I flashed them to ROBIN firmware which implements the BATMAN mesh.&nbsp; The ROBIN firmware comes from <a href="http://www.blogin.it">www.blogin.it</a>.</p><p>It seems very nice and the OpenWrt backbone is very neat.</p><p>Here&#039;s my problem:</p><p>I can access the internet from the gateway node, but when I attempt to access the internet from a client node nearby (not a gateway--repeater/AP/client only), it doesn&#039;t work.&nbsp; &nbsp;I cannot get any sites to come up.&nbsp; </p><p>I read a note that the gateway might have to have NAT enabled, but I&#039;m also concerned that there might be some sort of a netmask problem.&nbsp; I did not manually set the gateway node IP (or if I did I restored it to the default setting of blank/empty)</p><p>Either way, I did no adjustment of the ESSID, IP addresses or anything that I did not return to the setting it had after a fresh flash.</p><p>I might just be on the networking short bus, but I don&#039;t see my problem.&nbsp; </p><p>I can ping all of the merakis from each other, so they are communicating.&nbsp; I am so close but I am pulling out my hair.&nbsp; Can anybody offer me some advice on how to restore internet connectivity to a nearby Meraki mini running ROBIN/BATMAN?</p>									</div>
