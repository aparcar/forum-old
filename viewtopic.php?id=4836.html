					<p>Thanks again. I&#039;ve followed the instructions listed in &#039;OpenWrt hacking&#039; document and created some files needed by the compilation process but I doubt it will work correctly.

					<p>Hi guys. I have posted all about my OpenWRT &amp; USB ISDN odyssey<br />on another topic: <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=23566">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=23566</a></p><p>I am currently running WhiteRussian RC4 on an ASUS WL-HDD 2.5.<br />I have an HFC USB adapter connected (I have compiled my own modules)<br />and am running a very stripped down version of asterisk (with very few stuff loaded)...</p><p>I experience a strange problem. Everything works fine, but after<br />some hours I just don&#039;t have any outgoing sound on incoming calls.<br />When somebody calls, asterisk rings the phones ok, I can pickup<br />the line, listen ok, but they can not hear me...</p><p>Restarting asterisk does not work. The only thing that seems to correct<br />the problem is rebooting the system. I guess this may have something to<br />do with the driver. Do you experience any strange behaviour after having<br />the system online for too long?</p><p>Antony</p>									</div>

					<p>This happened to me as well, on a regular PC though.</p><p>It reminds of a bug in asterisk some time ago, called &quot;no audio after 2006-01-25&quot; - search for it in google for more details.<br />Maybe it&#039;s somehow related.</p><p>I&#039;d bet it&#039;s asterisk problem, not ISDN.</p>									</div>
