					<p>I&#039;m a total newb here and need a little help.</p><p>I am interested in flashing my D-Link DIR-645 router to OpenWRT.&nbsp; I found the router&#039;s OpenWRT product page here (via Google):&nbsp; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-645">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-645</a>&nbsp; Strangely, I&#039;ve noticed that if I go up one level to the &quot;D-Link&quot; section that my router is not listed in the Table of Hardware.</p><p>As best as I can tell from what info I got on the product page and similar D-Link routers, I&#039;m guessing the target should be &quot;ramips&quot; since my router uses a RaLink platform as per the URL I provided.&nbsp; </p><p>The product page says the router is supported between OpenWRT versions R33843 to R33845.&nbsp; I also notice further down the page under TFTP instructions that I should be getting the RT3883 OpenWRT build.</p><p>So up to this point, I believe the proper URL I need to get the appropriate binaries for my router is:&nbsp; [url]<strong>http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09/ramips/rt3883/</strong>[/url]</p><p>Am I correct up to this point?</p><p>As best as I can tell, I need to download the following binary:&nbsp; <strong>openwrt-ramips-rt3883-root.squashfs</strong>&nbsp; and go through the usual firmware update via my router&#039;s stock firmware.</p><p>Can anyone verify that I&#039;ve made the correct guesses?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>DarthBobo</strong> on 23 Sep 2014, 00:25)</p>

					<p>If ANYONE can help,</p><p>I flashed my router using the firmware file named:&nbsp; &quot;openwrt-ramips-rt3883-dir-645-squashfs-factory.bin&quot; from the URL:&nbsp; <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ramips.rt3883/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ â€¦ ps.rt3883/</a> like was mentioned in this thread:&nbsp; <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=51013.">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=51013.</a></p><p>After flashing and rebooting my router, all I got was a power LED.&nbsp; The WIFI LED is off.&nbsp; I waited a few minutes to see if anything changed.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; Thinking I bricked my router, I tried to do a factory reset like mentioned in the debricking process.&nbsp; I now get a blinking Internet LED and my desktop does in fact have Internet access.</p><p>However, I cannot access the router&#039;s firmware.&nbsp; I am presumably running on OpenWRT, but my router isn&#039;t broadcasting wirelessly but its Ethernet ports work.&nbsp; There is no Gateway IP address listed for my router, but there are three DNS IP address (my ISP&#039;s DNS IP).&nbsp; In other words, my router is acting as a pass-thru.&nbsp; I tried going to 24.217.128.1 to see if I can access my router&#039;s firmware but I get nothing.&nbsp; Any ideas on how I can complete the upgrade process?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>DarthBobo</strong> on 25 Sep 2014, 03:36)</p>

					<p>I guess the only thing I can suggest at this time is that you attempt the de-bricking instructions from the page you already read: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-645#debricking">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-645#debricking</a></p><p>Preferably to the OEM/Stock firmware.
