					<p>Well in general.... <br />You can buy complete customized routers from several websites for $600USD and up. Is that really what you want to do? I suppose that you might find someone here to ship the router to and have them load the firmware. But you still may find Open-wrt to complex for you as modifications require a computer with SSH software capabilities. In general, Windows doesn&#039;t offer that, which implies you having another Linux machine available for configuration.&nbsp; There is a program called PuTTY which will adapt Windows to SSH.</p><p>If so, you might prefer DD-Wrt, Tomato firmware, or Oleg&#039;s WL500 firmware as the user interface is menu driven and doesn&#039;t require connecting at the command line with SSH. (it uses the HTM screens in your browser).&nbsp; Wikipedia has a listing of all the varieties under the Open-Wrt&#039;s entry.</p><p>Much depends on the actual memory capacity of your unit as Linksys manufactured some of that model with smaller firmware memory. I suspect DD-wrt is able to provide software for the smaller unit and other&#039;s may not.</p><p>Since these are ALL based on a GNU public license, it appears that you can get any of the files for free and install yourself.&nbsp; I just installed Oleg&#039;s on an Asus and it wasn&#039;t a&nbsp; big job.&nbsp; Next I am going to change over to Open-Wrt.&nbsp; </p><p>As you can see, Linux is very much about experimenting and learning computing in greater depth than Windows.&nbsp; If you keep an open mind, it will really provide a whole new world to you.</p><p>Of course over 90% of the computing world just wants something other than Linux or Unix and use the perjorative sense of the term geekish to describe Linux.</p>									</div>
