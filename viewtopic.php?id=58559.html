					<p>Hey guys,</p><p>I am currently working with OpenWrt and a carambola2 board. My plan is to optimize the boot process, my aim is to have a boot time of 20 seconds, currently it is by roughly 40 seconds.</p><p>I already tried to turn off unused services like cron. But this does not really decrease the boot time. I also had a look in some init scripts, and saw one where the scripts sleeps one second for &quot;Wifi settling&quot;. I really would love to delete the sleep, but then I think have maybe some unpleasant side effects. But how can I optimize such things and are there other places where the boot process is sleeping, which maybe can be safely removed?</p><p>So my question in general is, can you give me some hints how to analyze boot time and where to look at in terms of boot time optimization?</p><p>Thanks in advance and kind regards.</p>									</div>

					<p>Take a look to this <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=43237">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=43237</a></p><p>I think it would be a good idea make a script to modify OpenWRT source code to disable ALL unnecesary things, to make a real lightweight dist.<br />Only basic things to run with 1 ethernet and 1 telnetd server. And the rest that it can be downloaded dynamicly in each run from internet.</p><p>I hate things like ntp client enable by default, it has no sense services like that enabled by default in a linux dist for embedded devices.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>KHAN85</strong> on 22 Jul 2015, 21:58)</p>
