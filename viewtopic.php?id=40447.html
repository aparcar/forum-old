					<p>Hi,</p><p>i want to setup a squid proxy on my TP-Link WDR3600. With the newest beta2 firmware this router<br />works very good but i have two problems:</p><p>the first one is -&gt; FATAL: auth_param basic program /usr/lib/squid/nsca_auth: (2) No such file or directory<br />i installed the &quot;squid&quot; and the &quot;squid-mod-basic-auth-ncsa&quot; package by &quot;opgk install&quot; and used a working<br />squid.conf from another server. In /usr/lib/squid a file named &quot;ncsa_auth&quot; exists but i cant find it with <br />&quot;find / -name ncsa_auth&quot; no such file....</p><p>How can i get a working squid with ncsa authentication on OpenWrt, or is it impossible ?</p><br /><br /><p>My second problem is the wireless configuration.<br />After flashing the regulation region is set to US and txpower on 2,4Ghz to 27dbm. I dont need 27dbm and<br />i think the chip cant provide this heavy powerlevel so i set it to 20dbm what works fine, better than factory-<br />firmware which has only 17dbm (+3db antenna gain) enabled due to the regulation in my country (100mw EIRP).<br />When i set the powerlevel a second time it always reverts to 17dbm. In the webinterface<br />and /etc/config/wireless the choosen value is shown but in the realtime info section in network-&gt;wifi-&gt;edit<br />it is 17dbm, and thats correct, i tested 17dbm and 20dbm with a mobile device.</p><p>Did somebody know how to fix the powerlevel to 20dbm ?<br />I think the hardware limit of this Atheros chip or the router is 20dbm. Thats right ?</p><br /><br /><p>Best regards </p><p>ERZ</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>erz</strong> on 11 Nov 2012, 12:38)</p>

					<p>Nobody has an idea how to run squid with ncsa auth ?<br />This would be a pity because i flashed Open-Wrt to work with squid.</p><p>There is another Wifi-problem. I know rx/txantenna &#039;0x1&#039; results in using only the one antenna<br />next to the RF unit.</p><p>Whats means &#039;0x3&#039; ? Are there other possible values for my two antenna router TP-Link WDR3600 ?<br />I want to set 2,4Ghz rx and tx on one antenna and 5Ghz rx and tx on the other.</p>									</div>

					<p>ItÂ´s a long time sice I was here but thank you very much for the explanation.<br />The reason for using only one connector is to test a few homemade antennas.<br />I dont want to build two pieces every time, espacially for 5Ghz.</p>									</div>
