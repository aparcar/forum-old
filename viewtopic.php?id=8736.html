					<p>I wonder if anyone would know how to read in a thermal signal, I am thinking of overcloacking a wrt54gs and for protection in case of fan failure and/or overheating have a high or low signal trigger a reboot with a lower clock speed, I think the software can be programmed to do a nvram commit with a lower clock speed and then reboot, I don&#039;t think that would be a problem. </p><p>I guess the issue is; does anyone know of an input that the operating system can read and commit to the above changes.</p>									</div>
