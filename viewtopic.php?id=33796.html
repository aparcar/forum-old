					<p>Hello,</p><p>If I have used DNS name instead of IP address in destination field &quot;-d&quot; of ipatables when it will be resolved ? I suppose it will be resolved only once at firewall startup. My goal is to make somehow OpenWRT to re-resolve DNS names at certain time intervals, let&#039;s say every 1 hour. How can I do that ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Sounds like a good candidate for a shell script and cron. If I were doing it I&#039;d make a new chain within the table you are looking to add this rule to. Resolve the name to the IP, and put that in the chain. When, next time it runs, flush the chain, and reapply the rule with the (potentially) updated name.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Thanks for replying. Can I somehow utilize IPSets here ? Well I mean to use some address table or something like this ? In that case I don&#039;t need to update existing chain. Isn&#039;t it ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>alphalt</strong> on 31 Dec 2011, 17:36)</p>
