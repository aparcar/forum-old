					<p>Thank you forum2006, <br />but I solved that problem for me. Its not a clean way, but it works:<br />I edited the file &#039;configure&#039; in openldap-2.2.29 directory.

					<p>Hi forum2006, hi folks,<br />i&#039;d like to discuss with you about whiterussian, i&#039;d like to have a stable AP for home environment so i&#039;ve choosen to use WhiteRussian (&#039;cause kamikaze is quite instable), i&#039;ve created the entire environment as you suggested, i can clearly compile and create my own images, with &quot;make menuconfig&quot; i can create the SDK for making packages too.<br />i&#039;ve used:<br />svn co <a href="https://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/packages">https://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/packages</a></p><p>to get the entire package directory so i can compile them by myself.<br />i&#039;m in the same situation of &quot;openwrt&quot; user, but with whiterussian i cannot compile openldap, lighttpd, php5 and other things. i always get compilation error as reported from openwrt (user) and i cannot figure how to get out.<br />i understand packages are used by kamikaze but what svn should i do to have my own packages and have them working under whiterussian ?</p><p>Can you help me or write me down some notes on how can i solve this problem ?<br />Thank you in advance for your reply</p><p>Regards<br />Andrea (Ben) Benini</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks forum2006 for your quick reply,<br />today after reading your response i&#039;ve seen new official launch of Kamikaze 7.06 on openwrt.org homepage, i&#039;m quite happy of whiterussian but i can understand backporting and support for both whiterussian and kamikaze is an overkill. My router is equipped with Broadcom 5352, 16Mb Ram, Broadcom Wifi card integrated, so i need to use kamikaze 2.4 kernel if i want wifi and 2.6 kernel to use it without wireless.<br />Hope kamikaze could be stable enough and complete toolchain is easy to setup as whiterussian was</p><p>What about mmc module ? as many folks here i&#039;m using mmc compiled module to supply lack of space to my AP, is it working ?<br />I&#039;d like to recreate a device with php, sqlite, lighttpd and a lot of web pages, SD is a must for lot of us</p><p>Andrea (Ben) Benini</p>									</div>

If you need full support you should switch to kamikaze. As for me, I am happy with whiterussian, because I have successfully compiled php5, lighttpd from the kamikaze tree.<br />I you still want to use whiterussian you can try to use my packages here: <a href="http://nils.bastionbytes.de/packages/">http://nils.bastionbytes.de/packages/</a><br />bye</p>									</div>
