					<p>I installed openwrt in UBNT Unifi LR.<br />Here&#039;s the config:<br />config interface &#039;VLAN10&#039;<br />option type &#039;bridge&#039;<br />option ifname &#039;eth0.10&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;VLAN8&#039;<br />option ifname &#039;eth0.8&#039;<br />option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />option ipaddr &#039;192.168.101.24&#039;<br />option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;<br />option gateway &#039;192.168.101.1&#039;<br />option dns &#039;192.168.101.1&#039;</p><p>wireless is bridged to VLAN10, VLAN8 for management.<br />I already disable the firewall and the dnsmasq from startup.</p><p>I can connect to the AP and I don&#039;t experience any lagging in browsing or download from the AP, but if I ping from my router (which has vlan8 interface), the ping is not stable, it said : &quot;Destination Host Unreachable&quot;.<br />When I can ping, and login to the AP, i checked that the AP is not busy, low bandwidth and low CPU usage.</p><p>I didn&#039;t experience this problem with other hardware (openwrt/ddwrt based), so I think this is not network issue.</p><p>Does anyone experience a case like this?</p>									</div>
