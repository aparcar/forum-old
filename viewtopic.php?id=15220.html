					<p>Sorry in advance if this is in the wrong place and for being fairly ignorant about this subject. I have a problem to solve and am after some help in resolving it quickly.</p><p>I am working on an ultrasound telemetry project and am looking for a way to get I2C or RS232 data transmitted wirelessly. I have seen a pair of radios that take I2C in at one end and put out to USB at the other however these are quite expensive.</p><p>I have used terminal servers before which could be set up such that a reverse telnet or raw connection is made so any data received on the RS232 port is automatically (without any commands etc coming in on the port) sent out via TCP/IP. Ideally I would like that to go via Wifi</p><p>Scouting around it looks like I might be able to do just that by modifying an old Linksys WRT54GS (or similar) router to add one or two RS232 ports and upgrade the firmware. Am I right? Can it be used for raw data transfer - seems like it might as people have mentioned GPS connections.</p><p>I have worked with Unix and Xenix in a former life but have not done much with Linux yet - I am assuming that won&#039;t be a barrier!!</p><p>Haven&#039;t got my head around Kamikaze or White Russian. Do I need to? Could someone easily say which would be better for my needs?</p><p>Thanks for reading this far and for any help that might ensue.</p><p>Clive</p>									</div>

					<p>While those might help getting RS232 to a PC or bluetooth enabled device, I think the original post wants to bridge RS232 over TCP/IP using 802.11</p>									</div>
