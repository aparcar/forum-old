					<p>Hello,</p><p>When I copy the file over wireless between two notebooks (within the LAN of course; device and laptops are in the same room), the transfer is slow: usually about 1 MB/s (showed by total commander).<br />During the copy pings to the device are lost....</p><p>I&#039;m using Kamikaze 8.09.02 (brcm-2.4). The same issue was on 7.09.</p><p>I&#039;ve checked the power settings in wireless adapters driver properties and all is fine...</p><p>Is ther anything that I can do to get the copy through wireless faster?</p><p>Thank you in advance and kind regards</p>									</div>

					<p>20 megabit or so is typically good performance for a wireless G lan. Remember wireless is a half duplex medium, so you cut your bandwidth in half transmitting station to station. Ad-hoc could potentially be faster, but has serious disadvantages. If you really want faster wireless to wireless transfers I suggest adding a second access point on another channel.</p>									</div>
