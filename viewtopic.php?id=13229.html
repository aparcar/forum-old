					<p>Is it possible to use soundcard connected via usb to router (WL500GP) as networked sound card accessible from Windows machine.<br />I&#039;m not only looking for MP3 player solution, but use it as general sound card in windows.<br />My router is in the same room as main computer so I&#039;m thinking about using only one set of speekers (now I have one set connected to router and another one to windows desktop machine). I&#039;m looking of te possibilites to share speakers connected to router.</p>									</div>

					<p>there&#039;s a project on Sourceforge that looks like it was discontinued. <br />It basically shares USB over IP and presents it as a virtual device under windows. <br /><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/usbip/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/usbip/</a></p><p>No idea if it works, or would work under Openwrt.</p>									</div>
