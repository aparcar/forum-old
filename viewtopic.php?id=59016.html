					<p>Hey everyone!</p><p>I know I am probably not going to be popular with this idea, but is there some way we can NOT lose a text that was written?</p><p>Fa few minutes ago I tried to post a rather lengthy problem description (including info on vlans and all the other stuff). Then I clicked &quot;Preview&quot; and as it seemed, I took too long because all I got was &quot;You do not have permission]...]&quot;. I was logged out. Going back didn&#039;t help, so my whole text was sent into informational nirvana. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/mad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="mad" /></p><p>Ok, I know it was dumb to write up a text like that without first copying it. But seriously, most forums just ask for your login info and then show the preview. But quietly logging the user out and sending the text to /dev/null is just bad.</p><p>Any chance this can be fixed?</p><p>Best,<br />Mouse</p>									</div>
