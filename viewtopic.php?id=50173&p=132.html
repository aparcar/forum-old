FWIW, I have the same issue with WiFi performance, and have even RMA&#039;d the router a few weeks ago, and still have the same issue with the new router: WiFi speed starts off fine then suddenly drops off (~2-3Mbps) after some period of time (a couple of days). In my case, this drop in speed happens with both OpenWrt and stock Linksys firmware (although the latter offers better initial WiFi speeds - I can get my full 30Mbps down, where I only get 15Mbps down with OpenWrt). What amazes me is that you&#039;re the only person that I&#039;ve seen complain about the drop off in WiFi speed after some period of time (although this thread has gotten pretty long and I might have just forgotten) - but it seems that most people are using a hard-wired connection and reboot their router frequently (which, temporarily, fixes the problem) when they install a new firmware.</p><p>So... while not a solution for you, FWIW, you&#039;re not alone with the drop in WiFi speed, I feel your pain as, pretty much, all of my devices are wireless, but a reboot temporarily fixes the issue and it seems to be the same with stock firmware...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>silca</strong> on 1 Mar 2015, 17:50)</p>

					<p>I did my first attempt at a openwrt install by using OpenWrt Chaos Calmer r43823 / LuCI Master (git-14.359.33351-5e6c33e) and I am facing a weird problem.<br />I got PC1 on ethernet directly cabled into the router and Laptop connected on radio0 with N.<br />Now my Laptop can see DHCP Inform packets made by itself on wifi and PC1 on eth. It cannot however see DHCP ACK packets made in reply to DHCP Inform packets. My PC1 can see these DHCP ACK packets tho are being made by the router&#039;s DHCP-server.<br />Now I thought that I couldn&#039;t see the router, but when my Laptop made a DHCP Request (from 0.0.0.0), it did get the DHCP ACK packet. </p><p>While I was writing this another weird thing happened with DHCP:<br />Wireshark on my Laptop tells me it sent 1 DHCP Request packet.<br />Wireshark on my PC1 tells me that it received 36 DHCP request packets but 0 DHCP ACK packets.<br />Wireshark on my laptop tells that it received 36 DHCP ACK packets.</p><p>Each DHCP Request packet seen on PC1 has the same Identification header.<br />Each DCHP ACK packet seen on Laptop has a unique Identification header (and checksum).<br />Not sure how the packet got replicated.</p><p>Network on Ethernet:<br />* nas-server<br />* printer<br />* PC1<br />* TV<br />Each on their own port on the router, no switches involved.</p><p>Network on Wifi:<br />* Android phone<br />* Laptop running windows 7</p>									</div>
