					<p>I&#039;m having the same problem with backfire 10.03.1 / 2.6 kernel</p><p>There is a a post by jow <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=147355">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=147355</a> which says *Fixed default network configuration for ASUS WL-330gE</p><p>Other than this I haven&#039;t managed to turn up much on the problem.I have tried using RC-5, RC-6 and release version without sucess. I did find somewhere about using different drivers, so have attempted to use the buidroot to test different options. Each time the build is successful, router flashes fine and I&#039;m able to log in, but as soon as I try to enable the wireless it crashes and locks me out. The wireless LED comes on and OpenWrt SSID shows up on my laptop but can&#039;t connect.</p><p>One thing I have noticed is that on bcrm-2.4 the wireless interface is listed as wl0 whereas it gets called radio0 when attempting to run bcrm47xx.</p><p>I would stick with 2.4, but I want to get batman-adv running.</p><p>If anyone has any suggestions they would be much appreciated, I will attempt to write up a solution if I find one.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>P.S. I&#039;m relatively new to the buildroot environment so if you have suggestions or solutions that require it please try to be clear on the paths to things as I haven&#039;t quite figured out where everything is yet.</p>									</div>
