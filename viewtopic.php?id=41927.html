					<p>Hello. I want to write a module in OPENWRT which will monitor the router&#039;s ethernet interface for a packet coming from a specific source address and afterwards,it will execute a command depending on that packet. Can anybody please tell me how to proceed ? Which libraries and commands should i use&nbsp; ? Lastly, i have read the DEVELOPMENT IN OPENWRT page, but couldnot understand the procedure. Can someone help me out ? Thanks</p>									</div>
