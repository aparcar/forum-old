					<p>Hi</p><p>I&#039;ve cross-compiled a own grep, because I need all the features for scripts and so on... and the busybox-grep haven&#039;t got this.<br />I made a binary file only (no package,.) and copied needed libraries from the sdk to /usr/lib. And it worked really good - I absolutely don&#039;t know what happened, but all of a sudden my &#039;grep&#039; only spits out &quot;Aborted&quot; right after I start it.<br />Does anyone else had this behaviour.<br />Please help - it&#039;s quite important.</p>									</div>
