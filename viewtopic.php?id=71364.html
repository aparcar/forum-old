					<p>Hi, </p><p>I&#039;m about to modernize my Wifi Network and need some help.</p><p>Currently running Sophos UTM Firewall on cable modem, Firtzbox Wireless and Dect and some Sitecom AP with openwrt on, both having seperate sid&#039;s.</p><p>There are 2 families on the wifi network, 8 persons, 16 devices.<br/>The house is fully wired with a gigabit network.</p><p>I&#039;d like to place 3 Access Points around the house, and want the 16 devices to roam to the best connection.<br/>optional: 2 Networks, one for each family.</p><p>Now to my questions:<br/>Is this doable with OpenWrt?<br/>What hardware would you recommend? (Budget: up to 150usd per AP, hassle free OpenWrt installation, 2.4 and 5 ghz, if possible mimo)</p><p>Any comment is appreciated.</p><p>Regards, zn00p</p>									</div>
