					<p>Thank you for that, I saw the guide before but<br />unfortunately - it is bit of struggle understanding OW manuals and guides hence the question,<br />hoping someone can give me few commands that will make life simpler.</p>									</div>

					<p>Most of Openwrt code is built by <br />1) downloading a 3rd-party package from the source site (defined in package&#039;s Makefile) to &lt;buildroot&gt;/dl <br />2) uncompressing the source to &lt;buildroot&gt;/build_dir/target_XXXXX/YYYY<br />3) patching the source there using patches in numerical name order from &quot;package Makefile dir&quot;/patches<br />4) compiling the source code and installing the binaries to the firmware image dir structure.</p><p>simple &quot;make&quot; does all of that.</p><p>phase 1 can be done separately by &quot;make download&quot;<br />phase 2 and 3 is done by &quot;make prepare&quot;<br />and phase 4 with &quot;make compile&quot;.</p><p>If you are e.g. adding new patches to package &quot;collectd&quot;, add your patches to that modules patches dir (&lt;buildroot&gt;/feeds/packages/utilities/collectd/patches ).<br />then do &quot;make package/collectd/prepare&quot; to see if the patches work.<br />(or &quot;make package/collectd/{clean,prepare}&quot;)<br />and if the patches work ok, do a normal make.</p><p>If you are doing anything simple, you don&#039;t really need quilt. Just first edit the needed source file and then create a patch by diffing that modified file against an original copy. And use that as a patch.</p><p>If you are patching some script or something like that, so that the final source code is already in the Openwrt build, you can just edit the source there.</p><p>And remember that anything in &lt;buildroot&gt;/build_dir is just temporary.</p><p>The system is rather simple and straightforward, once you grasp its logic.</p><p>What package you are trying to patch? You might get more helpful answers if you tell that.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 4 Nov 2013, 21:31)</p>

					<p>Hnyman,</p><p>thanks for that - it helps great deal,</p><p>My aim is to load OW a Beaglebone Black single board computer connected to a WIFI stick called Linksys AE3000 and run the system as a Mesh Node.</p><p>It seems like neither of my devices are supported out the box,</p><p>1. there is a Buildsystem on the Github:<br /><a href="https://github.com/artekw/openwrt-bbb">https://github.com/artekw/openwrt-bbb</a></p><p>2. on OW there is a Changeset for the Wifi stick:</p><p><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/37843">https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/37843</a></p><p>So I am not sure where to start to build a working image for the device?</p><br /><p>thanks again.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ahh, your quest is much much harder than &quot;applying patches&quot; that you originally were asking for.</p><p>You should check from some older check-ins how support for new devices is added. That requires rather many patches.</p><p>Your own example contains this: <a href="https://github.com/artekw/openwrt-bbb/commit/0a53f583856efc8f618784d810ff65aa9e9d5386">https://github.com/artekw/openwrt-bbb/c â€¦ aa9e9d5386</a></p><p>(one of the files is a large patch collection of over 1 megabyte)</p><p>From Openwrt check e.g.<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/35058/">https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/35058/</a></p><p>You might also try using the buildsystem from Github, but that is apparently several months old.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 5 Nov 2013, 00:01)</p>
