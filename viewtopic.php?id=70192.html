					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;m a beginner developer so I&#039;m not used to that kind of things.<br />For a project of mine I need to know the byte count for an interface. I see LuCI is capable of this but I can&#039;t really find how nor where it&#039;s doing it, I&#039;d use it as an example for my goal. Can you link me the code which is getting the byte count?<br />Thank you!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>livingsilver94</strong> on 11 Mar 2017, 23:00)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m certain there&#039;s a more elegant way which you can discover if you look at the luci code, but I think you can accomplish the same result by screen-scraping ifconfig.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the hint, I haven&#039;t thought of such a simple solution.<br />Fortunately, with a search based on your suggestion, I found the magical world of /proc/dev/net (cannot link the source. Bummer). Pretty useful and easy to parse.<br />By the way, for the sake of curiosity, my original question is still open <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>
