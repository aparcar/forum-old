					<p>I want to cross-compile a program (darkstat, see <a href="https://unix4lyfe.org/darkstat/)">https://unix4lyfe.org/darkstat/)</a> for my 15.05.1 ar71xx router.</p><p>I just successfully set up my openwrt build system, but the cross-compilation of the program (darkstat) fails due to zlib &amp; pcap. I was able to find zlib and libpcap in make menuconfig and compile the openwrt build system, but I couldn&#039;t find them in the the toolchain subdirectories (usr/lib)? </p><p>i also did &quot;make package/libpcap compile&quot; and &quot;... install&quot;, but still i cant find the libs in the toolchain subdirectories...</p><p>Ayn hint?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kilian2050</strong> on 27 Dec 2016, 20:33)</p>

					<p>I have removed some of your other posts w.r.t the same topic because it is a violation of OpenWRT forum ToS to cross posting. FYI, if you prefer to post this on the general forum, I will be more than happy to move this post here.</p>									</div>
