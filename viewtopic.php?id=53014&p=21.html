					<p>I am having a problem that the wifi AP on my ht-tm02 is automatically turned off when the wifi client (for wan) loses connection. </p><p>I configured two wifi interfaces on my ht-tm02 to connect to my main router. (The use case is that when I travel, I can use ht-tm02 to connect to a wifi or wired internet at hotel or airport.) I set one interface in client mode to connect to WAN (through that main router), another interface&nbsp; in AP mode to connect to my LAN. It worked well. I can access internet by connecting to the AP interface. But strangely when I turn off the wifi on the main router, both wifi interfaces on the ht-tm02 were disconnected. Because I also configured the only ethernet port on ht-tm02 to WAN (leave only wifi interface on LAN side), I cannot login into it. This makes it impossible to configure a new wifi internet. </p><p>Anything I need to add/change to the config files:</p><p>/etc/config/wireless<br />config wifi-device &#039;radio0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option type &#039;mac80211&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option channel &#039;11&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option hwmode &#039;11g&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option path &#039;10180000.wmac&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option htmode &#039;HT20&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option txpower &#039;20&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option country &#039;00&#039;</p><p>config wifi-iface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option encryption &#039;psk2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;radio0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ssid &#039;bliss-mobile&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option mode &#039;ap&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option network &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;private key&#039;</p><p>config wifi-iface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ssid &#039;bliss_2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option encryption &#039;psk2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;radio0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option mode &#039;sta&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option bssid &#039;86:12:5E:D7:26:5A&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option key &#039;wifi internet key&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option network &#039;wwan&#039;</p><p>/etc/config/network<br />config interface &#039;loopback&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;lo&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;127.0.0.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask &#039;255.0.0.0&#039;</p><p>config globals &#039;globals&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ula_prefix &#039;fd1a:7ebb:3965::/48&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option force_link &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option macaddr &#039;mac address&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ip6assign &#039;60&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;10.10.10.254&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option _orig_ifname &#039;eth0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option _orig_bridge &#039;false&#039;</p><p>config switch<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option name &#039;switch0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option reset &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option enable_vlan &#039;0&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;dhcp&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth0&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;wwan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;dhcp&#039;</p>									</div>

					<p>There are a number of posts and approaches to this issue and I have tested many.&nbsp; The two I like are below.</p><p>This one basically is the simplest which just removes the offending STA wifi-iface.<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=278230#p278230">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 30#p278230</a><br />It depends on the device, but I have set this up to run on boot (create a script and point to it in local startup) or via a button (same script called by the reset button at some amount of press delay)</p><p>This is more sophisticated and allows the user to maintain a list of APs in a config file.&nbsp; It chooses the best available AP automatically.<br /><a href="http://www.gl-inet.com/forums/topic/wifimgr-tool-to-automaticaly-select-an-apstation-from-a-list-of-saved-aps/#post-11953">http://www.gl-inet.com/forums/topic/wif … post-11953</a><br />hostle19 is making some mods to this here <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=311777#p311777">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 77#p311777</a> but I have not tested them yet.</p><p>The wiki is new, and I have not reviewed the offered solutions as yet.</p><p>Another approach is to use a second physical radio, which is more reliable, but potentially slower.&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=58548">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=58548</a></p><p>I have been concerned about setting the Ethernet to WAN as you have seen.&nbsp; I now also have a GL.inet AR150 which has both WAN and LAN.</p>									</div>

					<p>I installed wingspinner&#039;s r44945-ws.bin on a ht-tm02. When I tried to add openvpn on the router, I got an error message that kmod-tun is missing. I checked the package list in r44945.

					<p>Thanks for the infos on the 15.05.1. It looks like the kernel problem affect other devices, at least this is my thought, but maybe it could be safer to wait and see. I was resetting the unit so I thought I could give it a try. <br />My experience was that for mobile use models with a battery (like TM01, TM03 or rawpowers WD01, wd02 (discontinued) or newer wd03) are better, since you don&#039;t need a power source nearby. Sure you can connect the unit to the power pack of your mobile, but I decided it was easier to get both on the same thing, even if street price is higher (around 39 € or $, I know it should be cheaper in Europe, but distributor is USA based, so he must add import and vat, I guess).<br />This said, I was so surprised at the strange behaviour of my unit that I kept flashing and reflashing it with original firmware, but nothing change.
