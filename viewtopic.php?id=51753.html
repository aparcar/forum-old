					<p>Hello, I tried to search for this but i couldnt find anything so i apologize in advance if this has been asked/answered a dozen times before. (factory defaults just gives me a bunch of results on how to reset the device to factory defaults, not set what factory defaults are) Im going to be setting up a bunch of routers at different locations and wanted to be able to make changes on them and be able to set this as the &quot;factory default&quot;. Mainly in case a user changes/resets the system I would like certain defaults in place so that I do not have to go on site if/when something happens. is there any documentation for setting this?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>abeck</strong> on 21 Jul 2014, 19:20)</p>

					<p>You can&#039;t change &quot;factory defaults&quot; outside of the &quot;factory&quot;. You can only set them within the firmware during the build process. Once the device has been flashed with the firmware, those defaults cannot be changed - which is kind of the point.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you build your own version of the firmware, you can include whatever files you want.<br />See <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build#custom.files">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build#custom.files</a></p><p>For example, you can include SSH certificates, wifi settings etc.<br />The included &quot;custom files&quot; will overwrite the defaults ones generated earlier i the build process.</p><p>I build a community firmware, where I include certain settings in the binary. Those are then &quot;factory defaults&quot; for the users.</p>									</div>
