					<p>Look for a photographer who has experience with weddings. It is best to use a professional wedding photographer who has shot many weddings. This gives them the experience they need to know when certain events are going to happen and the know how to successfully capture that event. As some families may be huge they have the experience of setting families up in poses.</p>									</div>
