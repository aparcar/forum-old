					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am very new to OpenWRT, and I have been doing a lot<br />of digging recently about kamikaze firmware. But&nbsp; I <br />think not enough.......... </p><p>I looked at the support list from OpenWRT wiki,<br />(BTW, some of the links are broken/missing in<br />in the wiki, is there a new one coming out????)</p><p>I couldn&#039;t find the WRT310N router.</p><p>Then, I read about the raw trx file called: </p><p>openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx </p><p>This file is targeted at Broadcom chipset, which<br />is what my router WRT310N is using Broadcom <br />47xx series. I can confirm that the router is <br />using this chipset since I am using dd-wrt, <br />and from there, I found it out. </p><p>I could be wrong, that is why I am asking this question.<br />Just to confirm it.</p><p>Thanks for your precious time in reading this post.<br />Hopefully someone is kind to help out.</p><p><img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
