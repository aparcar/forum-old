					<p>Hello, I have a TP-Link TL-WDR4300 (HW ver 1.4), and modded the internal GL850G chip to get another USB port (as described in the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300#usb.modification">Wiki page</a>), but the additional port isn&#039;t detected.<br />I double checked the connections, I&#039;m using pin 11 and pin 12 and the connection are working, but didn&#039;t managed to get the additional port detected. Already tried with OpenWRT, dd-wrt and the official TP-Link firmware, but none of them detect this port...</p><p>I did the steps exactly as described in the wiki, but nothing works. Am I missing something? This mod requires a modified firmware build?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mbc07</strong> on 13 Aug 2013, 06:20)</p>

					<p>I found the issue, the cable I was using was too long (or was damaged)... using a shorter cable the connection works flawlessly! Thanks for the tip</p>									</div>
