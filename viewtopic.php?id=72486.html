					<p>I want to connect router to dormroom network &quot;eduroam&quot; and as far as I know I need openWRT to do that. I have Netgear wnr1000v3. I wanted to &quot;update&quot; my router with this file: &quot;openwrt-brcm47xx-mips74k-netgear-wnr1000-v3-squashfs.chk&quot;, but I found a thread somewhere that that didnt go very well. So I am asking if thats all I am supposed to do and hope that it works?</p>									</div>

					<p>The Netgear WNR1000 v3 is not compatible with OpenWrt, it&#039;s a Broadcom SOC with 4 MB flash and only 16 MB RAM - the later is a total deal breaker (absolute minimum 32 MB RAM, very much needed &gt;= 64 MB RAM), the wlan card doesn&#039;t <a href="https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/drivers/b43/soc">appear</a> to be supported either.</p><p>If you&#039;re looking for a well supported device for LEDE/ OpenWrt, please do take these <a href="https://lede-project.org/meta/infobox/432_warning">minimum system requirements</a> into account and prefer one of the common SOCs with good wlan support (ar71xx, lantiq (VDSL support, but wlan support varies between devices), mt7621, ipq40xx, ipq806x, mvebu).</p>									</div>

					<p>FFS I bought it just to do it. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> At least it was cheap used one. I saw it on the list and i thought it will be supported. Why there is that file? Do you know any other way to setup this router as client?</p>									</div>
