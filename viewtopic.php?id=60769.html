					<p>I&#039;ve tried every tutorial I can find to set up a wifi bridge but nothing works.&nbsp; I can install OpwnWRT on the router just fine, but no tutorial seems to work.&nbsp; Is there one for 15.05 yet?</p><p>My scenario is pretty simple, I have a computer with no wifi that I want to connect to the OpenWRT router, and have the router connect to the main wifi.&nbsp; The closest I&#039;ve come is having that computer able to access the internet and see other computers on the main network, but no computers could see the computer behind the OpenWRT router.&nbsp; Every tutorial has ended up with me completely unable to connect to the OpenWRT router though.</p><p>Is there something with relayd and the new version?&nbsp; All tutorials talk about setting things to &quot;relay&quot; but the new variable that I see is &quot;relay bridge&quot;.&nbsp; Is there a difference?</p>									</div>

					<p><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient</a> has the instructions</p><p>it has to do with the fact that wifi is a broadcast capable interface by default, and therefore has mac addresses and therefore you need either WDS (where the card itself needs to know how to behave as a switch, and the frame format that goes over the air is slightly different).</p><p>Or you need relayd to do the nat-like operation with mac and ip addresses.</p>									</div>

					<p>If your hardware allows it, go with <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds</a>, which is transparent to IPv6 and overall works more reliably.</p>									</div>
