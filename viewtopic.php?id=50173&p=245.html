					<p>I can absolutely buy a TTL cable, but i do have a usb to serial already. If i just get connectors on the right pins, do you think that would work? or is it different voltage?</p>									</div>

					<p>Voltage has to be 3.3v, while serial is 12v... you could use the serial with a MAX232 RS-232 module or equivalent.</p><p>I could be wrong, but I believe the cable firmware between a USB - TTL and USB - Serial are different, which is why you need an RS-232 module; plus the 3.3v has to be upped to 12v for the serial interface</p><p>USB - TTL are sold in two voltages, 3.3v and 5v, so make sure it&#039;s the 3.3v</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>JW0914</strong> on 6 Jul 2015, 00:38)</p>
