					<p><strong>@kyzhk</strong><br />I&#039;m just like you tried to reduce the power of Tx, but the Mrwlwifi driver doesn&#039;t let you change it. As part of your question, you can read<br /><a href="https://github.com/kaloz/mwlwifi/issues/202">https://github.com/kaloz/mwlwifi/issues/202</a><br />The only thing you can do, and so far that is not regulated by FCC, is to use antennas with the lowest power transfer factor.
