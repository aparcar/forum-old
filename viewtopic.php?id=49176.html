					<p>I thank you for your answer, but it&#039;s really generic! I have a lot of settlings: DHCP, WLAN, LAN, Mode, Networ, bridge etc. What do you mean with wifi security as required? And how do I enable wifi? Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>I have installed a new version of OpenWrt (mine was pretty outdated). After flashing in the new version, I think that everything was reset correctly, given that I was pointed to insert a new password. I have enabled the wireless. Now I can see that LAN is green and WAN is red. I think that it is red because I must do something. Do you know what I need to do to make it turn green? Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, so this means that red is a natural color for WAN? OK. But this doesn&#039;t solve my problem. If I try to connect from the default OpenWrt wi-fi network, I get a Server Not Found. The network is there, I can also connect to it, but then nothing is coming from the net. I can also ping the network: 192.168.1.1 and everything is in order. But I don&#039;t get any webpage in my browser. Also, if it could be useful, I have set 192.168.1.5 the Livebox from which I receive the signal for the TP-LINK. Please, read also this post:&nbsp; <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=226073#p226073">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 73#p226073</a>&nbsp; Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m still trying: no success! The network is activated. I can ping it and I can connect to it via wi-fi, but I don&#039;t get the webpages showing up in my browser. Just to summarized, the TP-LINK is flashed with a late version of OpenWrt and is connect via a cable to the Livebox. I would like to get from the TP-LINK the wi-fi internet. Thanks!</p>									</div>
