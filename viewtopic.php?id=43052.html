					<p>It seems like you need to recompile elinks to use spidermonkey (and compile spidermonkey)</p><p>As an alternative to all that, this might provide the functions you need:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/wireless.hotspot.nodogsplash">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/wirel â€¦ odogsplash</a></p>									</div>

					<p>@firecode - did you ever find a solution to this problem ?</p><p>I am in the same boat and I came to the conclusion that I would need elinks with javascript support to solve my problem - but I no clue on how to compile elinks (let alone with spidermonkey)... :-(</p><p>I have also had a look at nodogsplash but this seems to be yet another captive portal service for OpenWrt... What we actually need is to be able to a client of such a service... I&#039;ve looked at the nodogsplash documentation and I don&#039;t see anything that helps facilitate that.</p>									</div>

					<p>so what I did was:<br />compiled elinks in openwrt its under utilities in menuconfig or somewre under network don&#039;t remmember<br />then made litle modified ISP page where no need of javascript saved it in router, so for autentification didn&#039;t need javascript anymore <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /> and thats all. but if you realy need javascript then spidermonkey need to be patched into elink for it. hope it will help you <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
