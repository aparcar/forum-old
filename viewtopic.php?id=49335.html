					<p>I have a bunch of OpenWRT routers behind a main OpenWRT router/firewall.</p><p>These secondary routers are set up as wifi access points and get their br-lan IP from the main router via DHCP.</p><p>Thsi works fine except that these routers do not honor the DNS server info sent out by the main OpenWRT router; instead they go out directly to the net.&nbsp; This means than on those routers internal names do not resolve.</p><p>How do I get these routers to use the dns server IP sent out by the main router?</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@ts7200:/etc/config# cat /etc/resolv.conf
