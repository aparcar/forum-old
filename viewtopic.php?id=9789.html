					<p>I had openwgt on my Netgear WGT634U and the dir command worked perfectly. Now when I type dir to get a listing of whats in the directory, nothing happens. It is extremely hard to navigate without being able to see what is in a directory. Is this normal for Kamikaze? How can I view folders and contents of folders? </p><p>FYI I was able to get monitor mode and managed mode working. I can now connect wirelessly to another AP. </p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
