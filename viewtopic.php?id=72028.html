					<p>First of all thank you and congratulations for your amazing project! The OpenWrt is fantastic! Continue your amazing quality work!</p><p>How easy it is to install <strong>Pi-Hole</strong> on OpenWrt ?<br />I think it would be a great idea to work together with Pi-Hole project to make it easy to install on OpenWrt. <br />I think it is an amazing project that will bring in our OpenWrt another very important and critical functionality.<br />It will raise the quality and capabilities of OpenWrt to an even greater level.</p><p>What is your point of view?</p><p>In the current situation with (<em>for example</em>) the <strong>Asus RT-N66</strong> router, how easy is it to be installed?</p>									</div>

					<p>One way would be install pi-hole in an lxc container, if your router is sufficiently performant. I cannot personally comment specifically on the ability fro the Asus RT-N66 to provide lxc functionality, but (looking at the ToH) I really doubt it (a rasp pi seems to be higher-specc&#039;d).</p><p>Of course, the real thing is, why not use adblock? In some ways a superior solution, but without the fancy admin web UI.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;d suggest to try luci-app-adblock first, which roughly provides the same service, but is probably lighter on your router&#039;s ressources.</p>									</div>
