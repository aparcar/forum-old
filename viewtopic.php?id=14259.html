					<p>this is not related to the openwrt fw, but i was wondering if anyone could give me any tips to maybe un-brick or determine what happened to my factory fw DWL-2100AP..&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;i never tried using a fw other than dlinks..&nbsp; </p><p>basically i unplugged it and plugged it into a different power outlet, both are on my battery backup, so there were never any surges.&nbsp; after doing so i noticed that it wasn&#039;t booting, but instead appeared to be power cycling.&nbsp; &nbsp; the power light flashes steady then the lan light comes on, and about a second later both go out..&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the WLAN light never lights.&nbsp; and this cycle continues</p><p>anyone have any idea where i should start to diag the problem, or if its worth it with this router?&nbsp; </p><p>maybe some one could trade me a working model for this one (assuming mine can be recovered).&nbsp; or just try and do the recovery for me ?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
