					<p>I was hoping to do it over Ethernet because the access point is PoE and in a high place. I got it down and found my enclosure had become brittle from the weather and a bird had pecked holes in it! The tough tplink lives on. So in a way I&#039;m glad I had to get it down. Oh and the fail safe reset worked a treat thanks guys <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>will it be possible to find 2 &quot;unused&quot; pins on the ETH port, and connect them to the QSS button? maybe the GND is already in common.. you should then shortcut the right pins to &quot;remotely&quot; press the button to get failsafe XD</p>									</div>
