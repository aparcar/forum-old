					<p>Hi,<br />I have been using dd-wrt for quite some time, but then I decided to test OpenWRT, mostly due to dd-wrt not supporting my new router. However I flashed my router with OpenWRT and then found out that my version does not have a GUI...</p><p>I am a Windows guy, who LOVES GUI, can do a few lines in DOS, but absolutely nothing in Linux. Therefore I don&#039;t know how to either restore to the original firmware or apply GUI. Have been checking around, there are some tutorials, but only for people used to Linux. I don&#039;t even know how to connect to command line!</p><p>I found the original firmware here (<a href="http://www.tp-link.com/en/support/download/?model=TL-WR842ND&amp;version=V1#tbl_b">http://www.tp-link.com/en/support/downl â€¦ n=V1#tbl_b</a>), but it&#039;s zipped (in one tutorial I saw a line which expects it from internet source and unzipped...)</p><p>I&#039;d be also very pleased with a way to install GUI (mostly because QoS of the original firmware sucks).</p><p>So what I need here is:<br />- a few step tutorial how to connect to my router and enter the command line<br />- Written code to copy to the command line and achieve either of my two goals</p><p>I know I ask a lot, but please help me. I don&#039;t really want to use a brand new router as a 10/100 switch only.</p><p>Thank you in advance for a solution!</p>									</div>
