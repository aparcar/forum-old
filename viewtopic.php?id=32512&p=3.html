					<p>I think once you installed an Openwrt image, it automatically recognize how much RAM and ROM are available and can make full use of them.&nbsp; At that stage, uboot becomes irrelevant.<br />You can simply use the 4M openwrt to install additional packages using &quot;opkg install ...&quot;&nbsp; It is only necessary to build an 8M image when you want to put more packages in during compiling and the image size is larger than 4M.&nbsp; I found including packages during compilation can free up more ROM for future package installation.&nbsp; It is because the packages installed using opkg take jffs format, which has no compression, while the image compiled in squashfs format has compression built in, as I was told.</p>									</div>

					<p>1. Wait, forget the serial interface, I wrote it specifically to simplify the firmware. serial interface or JTAG is needed in extreme cases, if the uboot will be unbootable.</p><p>2. According to my experience the name of the &quot;boot&quot; in the firmware file is made to ensure that the developer can fix the uboot - it&#039;s logical.</p><p>3. No mtd does not support writing to the boot area if it does not allow the kernel by default. I meant the other way to flash the router firmware version of the old factory image, and then make 128k+OpenwrtFirmware (in hex editor) and now the flash from the web-interface (factory firmware) to the &quot;boot&quot; firmware prefixed as their own.</p>									</div>

					<p>I edited the factory.bin file use a hex editor by inserted the 128k uboot file at its beginning.&nbsp; As a result, the image ended at 0x007DFFFF instead of 0x007BFFFF as the original factory.bin file.&nbsp; I saved it as a xxxx_boot.bin file.&nbsp; When I flash it using the luci system flash firmware function, I got: &quot;The uploaded image file does not contain a supported format.

					<p>Finally I was able to compile the u-boot from TP-Link sources, for ap121 (ar9331 based devices).<br />The hardest was to find out how to fix the missing mips-linux-gcc error, as I have almost no idea about Linux.<br />I found the solution here (russian) <br /><a href="http://openrouter.info/forum/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=1553&amp;start=20">http://openrouter.info/forum/viewtopic. … p;start=20</a></p><p>You need the full 150Router.tar.bz2 file, not just the u-boot, as there are lots of dependencies.<br />Uncompress it to some folder. Enter into that folder.<br />Uncompress the file &quot;gcc-4.3.3.tar.bz2&quot; inside branch_hornet_linux/toolchain/ by doing &quot;tar -xf gcc-4.3.3.tar.bz2 ./&quot;<br />Create a folder called &quot;bin&quot; inside &quot;branch_hornet_linux&quot;<br />Create a file inside folder branch_hornet_linux called Makefile.<br />Edit it and paste the following:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>export BUILD_TOPDIR=$(PWD)
MAKECMD=make ARCH=mips CROSS_COMPILE=mips-linux-
export PATH:=$(BUILD_TOPDIR)/toolchain/gcc-4.3.3/build_mips/staging_dir/usr/bin/:$(PATH)
export FLASH_SIZE=4
export COMPRESSED_UBOOT=1
export CONFIG_HORNET_1_1_WAR=1

all:
    cd $(BUILD_TOPDIR)/ap121/boot/u-boot/ &amp;&amp; $(MAKECMD) ap121_config
    cd $(BUILD_TOPDIR)/ap121/boot/u-boot/ &amp;&amp; $(MAKECMD)
    cp $(BUILD_TOPDIR)/ap121/boot/u-boot/tuboot.bin $(BUILD_TOPDIR)/bin

clean:
    cd $(BUILD_TOPDIR)/ap121/boot/u-boot/ &amp;&amp; $(MAKECMD) clean
    rm -f $(BUILD_TOPDIR)/bin/*

clean_all:
    cd $(BUILD_TOPDIR)/ap121/boot/u-boot/ &amp;&amp; $(MAKECMD) distclean
    rm -f $(BUILD_TOPDIR)/bin/*</code></pre></div><p>remember to change &quot;export FLASH_SIZE=x&quot; to the MB of your flash. You still need to modify the ap121. if higher than 8MB.<br />do &quot;chmod 664 Makefile&quot;</p><p>Now, just open the terminal and go to the branch_hornet_linux folder.<br />Do:<br />make clean<br />make</p><p>It will compile in just a minute or so, and at the end it will put something like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Image Name:   u-boot image
