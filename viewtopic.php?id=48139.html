					<p>I have a situation I am trying to fix.&nbsp; I am working in a concrete house.&nbsp; We have an access point central on the ground floor (where there is a wired drop) which covers the house, but due to the concrete the signal is really weak on the second floor.</p><p>I&#039;d like to set up WDS to connect the two floors so we can get better coverage.&nbsp; I&#039;m OK with using a dual-radio unit on each floor; one radio to provide coverage on that floor and one radio to provide the WDS link.</p><p>I&#039;m thinking units with removable antennas would be good too.</p><p>Anyone have any recommendations on hardware for this kind of setup?</p>									</div>
