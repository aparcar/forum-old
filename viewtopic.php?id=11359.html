					<p>Ok just upgraded my router a WRT54GS v4 from an older openwrt build to Kamikaze. Everything seems to have gone ok during flashing. But now i can only access it via telnet. Is this normal for the Kamikaze firmware?? If so is there a package i can install to regain the web interface?</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;d recommend not using the X-WRT images for Kamikaze.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if they go through the same level of testing the OpenWRT images have gone through.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had several strange problems using X-WRT Kamikaze images such as reboots and qos not working (using qos from the XWRT packages).&nbsp; Install all the packages you need from the OpenWRT 7.06 packages (with the exception of the web interface).&nbsp; </p><p>To get the X-WRT web interface, first install haserl (from the OpenWRT packages), then install the web interface from:<br /><a href="http://downloads.x-wrt.org/xwrt/kamikaze/7.06/brcm-2.4/packages/webif_0.3-3_mipsel.ipk">http://downloads.x-wrt.org/xwrt/kamikaz â€¦ mipsel.ipk</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, WhiteRussian has a built in webif.&nbsp; X-WRT has webif that replaces the built in webif of WhiteRussian.&nbsp; You can get by with the WhiteRussian built in webif - the X-WRT version expands its capabilities though.&nbsp; </p><p>Kamikaze doesn&#039;t have a built in webif at this time - so you need to use the X-WRT webif or go line command mode.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well i managed to setup a http server on the computer i have connected to the router and get a trx file onto the router, then i rean the mtd command just as shown on the wiki. It seemed to work fine except an hour later the power light is still flashing. I tried, after waiting an hour to power it on and off and i still just get the blinking light.</p><p>Is it &quot;bricked&quot; or is this something easy to fix?</p>									</div>

					<p>I also had problems to reflash my WRT54GL running Kamikaze. <br />You can solve using TFTP, or alternatively, you can use Linksys utilities to recover or upgrade the firmware. You can find these official Linksys utilities somewhere on the web (I don&#039;t remember where I downloaded mine, I think on Linksys web site). This tool will install Linksys firmware on your AP. Then you can install OpenWrt.<br />But at first use TFTP. I don&#039;t think your AP to be bricked.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ggp81</strong> on 25 Jun 2007, 10:44)</p>

					<p>Webif^2 has more features than old Webif, so it would be ok for you.<br />In particular, what&#039;s your problem? What are you looking for?</p>									</div>
