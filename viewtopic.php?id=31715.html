					<p>OK, I&#039;ve been searching for a couple of hours and so far found nothing specific to my situation - but then the keywords are very common and widely used in completely different setups so huge numbers of hits ...</p><p>I need to setup a router on an ASDL line where multiple IPs are provided by the ISP - we&#039;d probably use a Linksys WRT54GL and a Draytek Vigor 120 modem (we&#039;ve used these before, but are open to alternative suggestions). But, the IP provided by the ISP to the PPPoE client is one of those AND all the connected devices must be on public IPs - so I need some sort of bridged setup.<br />Eg, the customers allocation is 192.0.2.0/27, 192.0.2.1 is given to the PPP client by the ISP, and the attached devices must be on 192.0.2.2/27 and so on (each device is a router/firewall itself). The end result we need is that we present an ethernet port where the attached devices only need to know that 192.0.2.1/27 is the gateway. WIreless isn&#039;t needed in this setup - but might be in others - this is a common setup for multiple IPs in the UK.</p><p>Can anyone point me to anything on this - a HowTo would be great !</p>									</div>
