					<p>Ok. I think I have to be some bit clearer.</p><p>Fonera 2200 + mmc_over_gpio package on kamikaze (trunk 11770, kernel&nbsp; 2.6.23.17) = correctly recognizes cards up to 4Gb.<br />But the drive uses gpio 2 and 7 which where already used to blink the wlan and the power leds, respectively.<br />Now, the power led (gpio 7) doesn&#039;t cause any problem because it toggles on at the beginning and the kernel doesn&#039;t change it anymore, but the wifi led is used intensively by the atheros wlan0 device.</p><p>I tried to use gpioctl in this way:</p><p># gpioctl dirin 2<br /># gpioctl dirout 7</p><p>and it seems to work at the beginning.<br />But sometimes the ath0 looses connection and it has to restart (also if I start it with &quot;/etc/init.d/network restart&quot;); in this case the wireless driver gains again the control of gpio 2 and breaks the mmc driver.</p><p>The question is: is there any way to disable the use of wifi led (a) directly on the wireless driver or (b) with some sort of gpiomask?</p>									</div>

					<p>I never own Fonera 2200. Can I safely assume &quot;Atheros wlan&quot; means madwifi driver ?<br />If it is madwifi driver, the answer to your question (a) is NO from what I&nbsp; know. The settings of Led, on/off <br />blinking rate adn etc are done in HAL. The driver has utility functions for ledpin and softled that you can control by<br />sysctl. There is also a gpio for rfkill which is basically for to turn on/off wireless. softled and ledpin can be /are being <br />used to drive external leds of a laptops for example.</p>									</div>

					<p>Your help was very useful. After your hint and some googling, I found this: <a href="http://madwifi.org/ticket/1018">http://madwifi.org/ticket/1018</a>.</p><p>Now with the command:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># sysctl -w dev.wifi0.softled=0</code></pre></div><p>I turn permanently off the madwifi use of the led.</p><p>For the sake of&nbsp; completeness I report the whole set of commands:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>sysctl -w dev.wifi0.softled=0    # softled and LED is always off
sysctl -w dev.wifi0.softled=1    # This is the default. LED keeps staying ON (no blinking at all!) when device athX is in status &quot;up&quot;, and LED is off when device athX is &quot;down&quot;.
sysctl -w dev.wifi0.softled=2    # LED blinks when device athX is &quot;up&quot; and transmitting or receiving data. LED is off when device athX is &quot;down&quot; or madwifi module is unloaded.</code></pre></div><p>So the answer is YES. Good for me.</p>									</div>

					<p>Good you solved your problem. <br />Atheros h/w and madwifi driver altogether control 4 leds. <br />As I mentioned, the two leds madwifi controls can be turned on/off by sysctl utility.<br />But, the other 2 leds managed by atheros h/w cannot be controlled by any means.</p>									</div>
