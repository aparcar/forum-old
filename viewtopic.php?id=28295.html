					<p>Hi,</p><p>I decided to upgrade my D-link`s crappy firmware to OpenWRT (to get it more reliable). But I propably did something wrong, because my router wont boot to &quot;os&quot; anymore, only to ADAM2-bootloader, which ip-address is 5.8.8.8.</p><p>OpenWRT-Wiki says to: &quot;Follow the standard DSL-5xx/DSL-G6xxT Installation and Upgrade guide&quot;, <br />so followed these instructions: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dsl-524t">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dsl-524t</a></p><p>Apparently something went wrong, I think that was in point where I was ment to do that whole &quot;GETENV&quot; and &quot;SETENV&quot; -thing.</p><p>I`ve tried to google all kind of insctructions to proceed or to go back original firmware, but no luck so far.. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /></p><p>Can someone help me? Thanks for the replies in advance!</p><p>Ps. I am on Linux/Win7 -environment</p><p>-Samu</p>									</div>

					<p>If you can ftp into adam2 then you router is not bricked. Probably just a FTP timeout during flashing. Try flashing again, here is what worked for me:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=18523">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=18523</a></p><p>M.</p>									</div>

					<p>that looks OK. <br />Maybe there is something wrong with your firmware. Did you compile it yourself? Which version? Used the right target? Part ions OK (GETENV)?<br />Also read <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/dsl-5xxt-install">https://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/dsl-5xxt-install</a><br />You could use a serial adapter to see whats going on during the boot process.</p><p>M.</p>									</div>
