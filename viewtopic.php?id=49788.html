					<p>Hi,</p><p>I would like to know how Internet blocking could be done for the the following 2 scenarios based on MAC address with a router with OpenWRT already installed. Gargoyle is not an option in my case.</p><p>1. White list based:<br />-disable all web access EXCEPT for white listed/allowed sites<br />-Some white listed machines (based on MACs) needs UNrestricted access<br />-MAC address white list and site address white list need to be managed easily <br />-I have found quick a solution here:<br />&nbsp; -http://www.linksysinfo.org/index.php?threads/how-to-block-all-web-access-but-allow-only-one-or-two-website-for-some-mac.29922/<br />&nbsp; -Is it possible to transform this short code to be able to add to OpenWRT Firewall settings, like /etc/config/firewall or /etc/firewall.user? Let me know, please how it could work.<br />-Tme/day based restriction would be nice to have<br />-It only has a few (3/6 lines) lines:</p><p># Allow these hosts unrestricted access<br />iptables -A wanout -i `nvram get lan_ifname` -m mac --mac-source &lt;allowed MAC #1&gt; -j ACCEPT<br />iptables -A wanout -i `nvram get lan_ifname` -m mac --mac-source &lt;allowed MAC #2&gt; -j ACCEPT</p><p># Allow everyone access to these sites<br />iptables -A wanout -i `nvram get lan_ifname` -d <a href="http://www.abcd.com">www.abcd.com</a> -j ACCEPT<br />iptables -A wanout -i `nvram get lan_ifname` -d <a href="http://www.dcba.com">www.dcba.com</a> -j ACCEPT</p><p># Everything else gets blocked<br />iptables -A wanout -i `nvram get lan_ifname` -j DROP</p><p>2. Black list based restrictions:<br />-It is like nr. one above, but all the way around.<br />-Enable web access for everybody except for black listed/restricted sites<br />-Some (white listed) machines (based on MACs) needs unrestricted access<br />-MAC address white list and site address black list need to be managed easily<br />-Tme/day based restriction would be nice to have</p><p>Thank you for the help in advance. I would need a quick solution for both. I am not a Linux guru, but it is ok to copy codes to etc/config/firewall or /etc/firewall.user files and entering domains and MAC addresses.</p><p>Thank you for the help in advance.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tpl_fun</strong> on 30 Mar 2014, 01:56)</p>

					<p>Hey there.</p><p>You can do nearly everything you like with iptables featurewise, but when it comes to easy maintenance, then iptables is not what you&#039;re looking for.</p><p>I would do that &quot;privileged access&quot; thingy with vlans.<br />Create one for restricted access and one for unrestricted access. Both obviously have different IP ranges, and the unrestricted part can be just &quot;allow all&quot;.<br />Put your privileged devices in that vlan by using the right switch port on your router for wired devices and create a dedicated privileged wifi that binds to the privileged vlan.<br />I would always prefer that over MAC based restrictions because you don&#039;t need to manage privileged MAC address lists. If you drop one device and by anouther one: Just use the privileged SSID instead of the unprivileged SSID. No need to reconfigure the router. You even don&#039;t need to know about replaced devices. Whoever has access to your privileged network knows the password of that privileged SSID. As long as he is capable of tapping on the &quot;wifi-unrestricted&quot; button instead of the &quot;wifi-restricted&quot; one, everything is fine and there is no need to bother you with new devices.</p><p>The restriction part ... is tricky. Iptables is fine for that as long as you know the correspoinding IP addresses. But if those IP addresses are subject to change at any point in time, then you always need to fear broken connections. Worked yesterday, but today things have changed. Not soo good.</p><p>I would completely block outgoing traffic for the restricted hosts and force them to use a HTTP proxy. This HTTP proxy can have allow lists based on host names or even URL patterns. Pretty nice to e.g. allow &quot;<a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a>&quot; but deny &quot;<a href="http://www.google.com/stuff/*">www.google.com/stuff/*</a>&quot;. </p><p>I&#039;m using &quot;privoxy&quot; as HTTP proxy. It&#039;s pretty small, as only a couple of configuration parameters but is really powerfull.</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>									</div>
