					<p>Hi all!<br />I would like to buy a supercheap router to install OpenWrt and to use it just as a DDNS&#039; update client. <br />I read a lot of documentation and that should be no problem... well, it might be a pity to use OpenWRT just for this purpose <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /><br />Anyway, I have little doubt: since I want to use my old router for&nbsp; the &quot;routing&quot; work and just plug the second router (with OpenWRT) to an ethernet port of the old one. Will be there any problems? Nat issues?</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>

					<p>Normally this should work, because ddns-scripts are able to detect your wan ip via a web call, so NAT is ignored.<br />It&#039;s like calling this special web pages with your browser from your pc connected to the &quot;old&quot; router.<br />A incomplete list of this special web pages you find at<br />WIKI <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/ddns.client#detecting_local_ip">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/ddns â€¦ g_local_ip</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you chris5560!<br />So, if I disable the dhcp server and I give an ip address to the OpenWrt router in the same subnet of the &quot;old&quot; router, everything should be fine <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
