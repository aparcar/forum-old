					<p>Hi guys, I own an Asus wl-500w router and recently I was thinking installing an openwrt on it.</p><p>After some reading on the forums and the wikis I think currently I can only install brcm-2.4 because the well-know driver issue for broadcom wireless card.<br />Well I have in fact another option, which means I could try brcm47xx(It is 2.6, am I right?) and buy a atheros card to replace the broadcom.<br />But it costs an extra money, and I have to open the box of the router, which is a little hard for me <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> I am very good at messing stuffs up.<br />So is it worthy to buy a new card to try 2.6? I mean, is there going to be any significant performance increasing if I use 2.6? Thanks</p>									</div>
