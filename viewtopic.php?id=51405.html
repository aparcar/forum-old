The router was not bricked and run dd-wrt firmware After power on the PC would try to get ip, right ? There is not try to get ip, I try to set static but nothing.

What about if there is a power failture when update official with boot in name (update u-boot) ? <br />2. Is it possible to corrupt ART partition while update dd-wrt to openwrt or openwrt to dd-wrt or both to stock ?<br />3. What will be the result if you use the newest official firmware on the first bootloader release for example ? Does the router boot without problems any time ? <br />4. Can you erase bootloader and art partition with dd-wrt/openwrt and how ? </p><p>Thanks !</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Experimentator</strong> on 6 Jul 2014, 22:16)</p>
