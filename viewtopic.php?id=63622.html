					<p>Hi,</p><p>There is a bunch of DIR-880L available for sale around 100$. They seem to have good hardware inside, so it might be a good deal, but I see no support for it by OpenWRT.</p><p>The router itself is VERY similar to supported routers by OpenWRT, for example:</p><p><a href="https://wikidevi.com/wiki/D-Link_DIR-880L_rev_A1">https://wikidevi.com/wiki/D-Link_DIR-880L_rev_A1</a></p><p>vs </p><p><a href="https://wikidevi.com/wiki/ASUS_RT-AC68U">https://wikidevi.com/wiki/ASUS_RT-AC68U</a></p><p>How hard would be to adapt to build a custom image for it? Also DD-WRT supports it, so there be might be possible to salvage from it some low-level info. like LED mapping, etc.</p><p>What do you think? I would like the forum option before buying one and starting the image building endeavour.</p>									</div>
