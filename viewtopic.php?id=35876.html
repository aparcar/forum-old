					<p>Hi, </p><p>I try to setup two routers using the configuration as described in <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedclient#using.routing">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/rou … ng.routing</a></p><p>It won&#039;t work. I can ping clients in subnet (192.168.1.0)&nbsp; from router2 (192.168.2.0), but connecions to a printer port 9100 won&#039;t work. </p><p>While pinging a client in subnet2 from subnet1 I got a &nbsp; &nbsp; Reply from 192.168.1.1: Destination port unreachable message? </p><p>I tried the configuration via wan port and via wifi wan port, but did&#039;nt work. <br />Internet access is ok.&nbsp; <br />Must be a trick? As I remeber that this was pretty easy using DD-WRT or M0n0Wall to connect two routers via a cable using two subnets. </p><p>THX </p><p>f41sixxs</p>									</div>
