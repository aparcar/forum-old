					<p>DD-WRT 24 will come with Virtual BSSID features : this will enable the use of multiple SSID and multiple security settings (Open, WEP and WPA).

The most difficult part (for me) is to adapt wlcompat. I don&#039;t really understand how this piece of code works (it is both a wrapper to wireless extensions and to the original driver but I feel that adapting without breaking it will be difficult). Other parts seem easy : using the new driver, implementing the new &quot;iovar&quot; functions and using them (documented in wlconf.c).</p><p>On bad news, some ioctl are no more valid. For example, setting tx power. Other are replaced by a call to the new &quot;iovar&quot; functions. The problem with those is that the possible variables are not documented in some .h. So we need to extract them from ASUS sources and from the drivers (with strings).</p><p>Would an OpenWRT developer be interested into a some kind of bounty on this feature ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi nbd,</p><p>I found this thread, an I felt like commenting on it:</p><p>According to the information I have gathered from the forum, the OpenWRT solution for Virtual Access Points (VAPs) is implemented by simply including multiple SSIDs by means of multiple IEs in the same beacon.</p><p>Advertising multiple ESSIDs within the same beacon as a solution is said to have a number of shortcomings (see: <a href="http://www.drizzle.com/~aboba/IEEE/)">www.drizzle.com/~aboba/IEEE/)</a>. The main drawback is that it is reportedly incompatible with many existing STA implementations (I have heard this from many places, though not experienced it myself.) </p><p>Another issue is that the usage scenarios where VAP implementations are particularly valuable normally require support for:<br /> -&nbsp; Different capability sets for each SSID<br /> -&nbsp; Multiple capability sets within an SSID<br /> -&nbsp; Pre-authentication routing</p><p>Do you know if OpenWRT is be able to support such general VAP capablities, even though the implementation is based on the simple use of multiple ESSIDs within a beacon? </p><p>A good solution for virtual APs is instead to use separate BSSIDs for each Virtual AP, and send a separate beacon for each SSID. That is, only one information element containing the SSID in each beacon, but a separate beacon per each SSID.</p><p>Do you know if there is any plans of implementing such VAP functionality in OpenWRT?</p><p>Hope these questions make sense to you. I must admit I have not yet tested out OpenWRT. I have ordered an LinkSys WRT, and I am excited about testing out OpenWRT. Meanwhile, I try to figure out what OpenWRT has to offer. And I am daydreaming about all the fun capablities I would like to test out...</p><p>B.Rgds,<br />trumph</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, you are right about incompatibilities with several different STA implementations. Especially Windows gets easily confused by this and often refuses to connect when different encryption types are used on different ESSIDs.<br />These capabilities do exist, although you typically have to tell the driver to broadcast only one ESSID, otherwise every single STA I know gets confused.<br />In the end, I don&#039;t consider this feature very useful because of all the problems that it creates for connecting clients.</p><p>If you want decent Multi-ESSID features, you should buy Atheros WiFi hardware instead, which supports multiple ESSIDs through multiple different BSSIDs.</p>									</div>
