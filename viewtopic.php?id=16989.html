					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve read some posts from last year regarding using a Linksys WRTSL54GS and various USB Audio Cards. I am new&#039;ish to OpenWRT, but understand how to flash and some linux basics. </p><p>Since the post is were from last year I wanted to know what is the current hardware recommendation for Linksys Routers and Audio.<br />What document/thread/howto will walk me through getting it to play audio via a usb sound card?</p><p>What my Goals are is to:</p><p>1. Have the router boot and automatically connect to a specified stream source.<br />2. Is it possible to route my stream over OpenVPN and have the router using OpenVPN play that stream (perhaps this question doesn&#039;t belong here)<br />3. If the recommended router has a button on it for it to cycle through say stream address 1 and stream address 2, and if possible additional streams.</p><p>I am looking specifically for a Linksys recommendation is because I have an unrelated application that already works on Linksys routers, and I don&#039;t want to change from what is currently supported.</p><p>Any help you can offer would be greatly appreciated!</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Ron</p>									</div>

					<p>I was pretty put off buy some of the responses i read on some topics, it seems unfortunate that when people are genuinely seeking assitance that there seems to be a dispropotionate ratio of NASTY posters willing to chime in to ridicule novices.&nbsp; After reading some of these responses I thought about not bothering to post at all, and instead trying to find my answer elsewhere.&nbsp; So I took a chance and who bothers to respond some jerk.&nbsp; so sue me for writing in the wrong area, do you know the answer to my question though?&nbsp; Could you take a second and actually respond in a more helpful manner, or are you such a repressed slug in your real life that you some how feel empowered by responding to a newb just trying to use cool technology to do something beyond what he currently knows how to do.</p><p>I thought since I wanted to know HOWTO do something I should post here, I don&#039;t usually deal with forums, and I don&#039;t know all your rules, but i do know manners, i even know how to use them, something I think you should try.</p><p>rterren</p>									</div>
