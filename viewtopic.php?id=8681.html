					<p>Hello guys,</p><p>I&#039;m a bit confused, please help me, so I can get the picture. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>1, I&#039;m using a WRT54GS 1.1 at home running OpenWRT White Russian RC6. I&#039;m not sure about things related to network bridging. I&#039;ve created two bridges, instead of the default &quot;all-in-one&quot; solution (br0) by using the vlan0 interface (wired network) for br0 and using eth1 interface and a wds connection (wireless network) for br1. Therefore, WLAN and LAN were physically separated. After that, I&#039;ve created all the needed routes between the two bridges. I could ping between the two subnets, if I assign IP addresses by hand, but DHCP just couldn&#039;t work on the WLAN interface. I&#039;ve created two instances of dnsmasq, one for br0 and one for br1, two initscripts, two config files, two subnets... The bind-interfaces option was given in both of the files, and the second one also contains except-interface=lo, so dnsmasq doesn&#039;t try to bind two times to the loopback interface. Well, after this, I tried to request for an IP address on a Windows machine (ipconfig /renew), connecting to the router&#039;s switch. DHCP worked okay, the client got an IP addrress in the 192.168.1.0 subnet.<br />But... if I tried to do that using a WLAN device, the router just didn&#039;t answer to any DHCP requests... But why? Maybe I should add the router&#039;s internal interface (eth0) to br1? I know, DHCP is a layer 2 protocol, so IP routing and &quot;normal&quot;, IP-based firewall rules don&#039;t make any effect on it. So, what could be the problem?</p><p>2, I&#039;m using the qos-scripts package on my WRT. Well, it works, but I think, it slows down the upload and download very noticeable, if I create too much options. Well, my question is: how many filter settings can be used on this model, without effecting the download and upload bandwidth too much (32MB of RAM, 200MHz processor clock)?</p><p>That&#039;s all for now, thank you guys, in advance!</p><p>Bye!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>I found the solution for my problem, it&#039;s best to share this bit of knowledge, maybe it could help some people.</p><p>First of all, there&#039;s two thing we must know before doing anything with network bridges: if you create a bridge, every single frame (OSI layer 2 PDU) will be transmitted by the router to all the interfaces, the bridge is created of. This makes our bridged interfaces appear as if they were one, large interface. This is a nice feature, if we need physically independent interfaces to be able to communicate with each other, without having to setup an own subnet for each interface. But, if we want to give non-bridged interfaces the ability to talk to each other, we have to set the appropriate routes between them.</p><p>IMPORTANT:<br />The following procedure is secure: if something goes wrong and you are unable to reach the router, don&#039;t worry: reboot, enter failsafe mode and correct the misconfigured files or restore them from the SquashFS partition (mounted as /rom).</p><p>Here it is how to do the job for WRT54GS models:</p><p>Open the /etc/init.d/S40network initscript and append the following lines to the end of the file (you can delete my comments if you think, they are unnecessary):<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># Creating bridges: br0 - LAN and br1 - WLAN+WDS
# First, let&#039;s create the LAN bridge:
ifconfig br0 down # bring down the bridge, that has been created during bootup, so we can manipulate with it
brctl delbr br0 # delete the bridge
brctl addbr br0 # create a new, &quot;clean&quot; bridge
brctl addif br0 vlan0 # add the LAN switch to the bridge
brctl stp br0 on # turn on support for Spanning Tree Protocol
ifconfig br0 192.168.1.1 # Give an IP address to the bridge. This will be the LAN address of the router
ifconfig br0 up # bring up the interface
# Ok, we can use the wired network from now on, let&#039;s create the wifi bridge:
ifconfig eth1 up
brctl addbr br1
brctl addif br1 eth1
#brctl addif br1 wds0.49153 # uncomment if you have a WDS connection and substitute the name of the WDS interface
brctl stp br1 on
ifconfig br1 192.168.2.1 # Wifi hosts will see the router by this address
ifconfig br1 up</code></pre></div><p>Okay, we now have two independent bridges, with the subnets of 192.168.1.0 and 192.168.2.0. The routing table will be expanded with two routes automatically, so we don&#039;t have to do anything with it.</p><p>Next step: tell dnsmasq to handle IP addresses from different IP address pools for the two bridges. To do this, open the /etc/dnsmasq.conf file in your favourite editor and insert the following line below the dhcp-range option already defined:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dhcp-range=192.168.2.100,192.168.2.150,255.255.255.0,24h # correct the ranges, if you changed the IP of br1</code></pre></div><p>Done! From now on, we have DHCP and DNS on both of the bridges and have full control over the wired and wireless part of the router. It&#039;s so cool, isn&#039;t it? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Well, my mistake was, that I didn&#039;t set an IP address for the br1 bridge, so dnsmasq didn&#039;t know what IPs can be assigned to wireless hosts... I learned so much since then <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I hope somebody will be happy by finding this small howto.</p><p>Bye!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>geryhun</strong> on 22 Dec 2006, 23:02)</p>
