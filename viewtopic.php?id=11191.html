					<p>Hi, i&#039;d like to run an IPv6 to IPv4 conversion deamon.</p><br /><p>This is to be able to access machines of the local network from a range of public IPv6 addresses.</p><br /><p>This will suppress the need to configure NAT rules each time we need to access a different service on a machine from the local network from outside.</p><br /><p>This is a very nice feature of IPv6 to be able to get a /48 subnetwork with as many address as we want.</p><br /><p>Today, it&#039;s not easy to implement Ipv6 on all machines, specially with hardware devices (like IP phones, camera,... ) , most of them are IPv4 and will stay IPv4 for a long time because their firmware is not opensource.</p><br /><p>That&#039;s why i&#039;d like to know if there is a package with such a conversion deamon.</p><br /><p>Thanks for your help.</p>									</div>
