					<p>I was able to get into the router again and reset it but I had to use windows as ubuntu was just going to be difficult, my problem now is that i still cant get internet access and in poking around I screwed up something else too.&nbsp; Now I can see the router pop up on my list but I cant connect to it, I guess I am going to have to do the failsafe mode again and possibly revert back to the original firmware.&nbsp; Is it weird for it to not allow internet access after install, I know it has a connection, it displays info about it and has activity but wont let it come though.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have the same problem. It&#039;s kind of weird. Everyone can make error, and i make something wrong on the Luci interface, an unknown error who was not trapped by the firmware and my router was totally out ! </p><p>So i power cycle it, and i make this 192.168.1.2 kind of solution, now my router can be ping (when i ping 192.168.1.1 the router return something good, and everything is ok about that) but reaching the router is not possible in any ways, not by html, not by ftp, and nothing in putty (ssh). </p><p>So, i bought a new router, having to go through telnet, using command line to gave it a password and having it ready to have ssh on it. Using ssh, getting on an sshl console, having to go through some path,&nbsp; makes command lines&nbsp; to have Luci on it (the graphical interface of openwrt), after that i was able to access it by a web browser (For god sake, what a long long way to have a router operational !!!) and made something wrong in a configuration given by this same web interface, and now i have a router accessible by pinging it, but unaccessible any other ways !!! </p><p>And after this being without any response to help, will i use Openwrt again ? Not sure about that ...</p>									</div>

					<p>In the wiki there an unbrick solution who is exactly this : </p><p>&quot;Triggering via keyboard key combination in a serial console<br />Unplug the router&#039;s power cord.<br />Connect the router&#039;s WAN port directly to your PC.<br />Configure your PC with a static IP address between 192.168.1.2 and 192.168.1.254. E. g. 192.168.1.2 (gateway and DNS is not required).<br />Plugin the power.<br />Connect via serial<br />Wait until the following messages is passing: Press the [f] key and hit [enter] to enter failsafe mode<br />Press &quot;f&quot; and the &quot;enter&quot; key<br />You should be able to telnet to the router at 192.168.1.1 now (no username and password)&quot;</p><p>Everyone knows that computers still have a serial port ! Hey, the last time i had a serial port on a computer was 10 years ago !</p><p>The serial port must be configured too, you don&#039;t tell how to set it. I mean what will be the speed, data bits, parity, stop bit, flow control. </p><p>And i don&#039;t have an old cisco router (Not talking about Linksys, real cisco routers, who doesn&#039;t used serial ports since 4 years ago). </p><p>So how could i expect having a home router with a serial port ?&nbsp; </p><p>And if there is no router with serial port, how can my ten years old computer serial port existing can establish a connection to an RJ45 ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Andreit</strong> on 12 Jul 2012, 00:24)</p>
