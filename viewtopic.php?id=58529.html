					<p>This has been driving me nuts, but I now have it all working. It&#039;s probably not very streamlined - for example it adds a new spi device for driving the LEDs where in reality that device *may* be similar to that in one of the rb400&#039;s and so might be re-usable... but to be honest I&#039;ve spent so much time on this that I need to get on with other things. Similarly, some of the naming is a bit off ( so that spi is called rb400-spi-misc for example, because it&#039;s also used in the RB4xx series and that was how it was named in Mikrotik&#039;s patches. )</p><p>As far as I can tell, Mikrotik&#039;s bootloader is buggy, so you have to replace it ( link and instructions in my patch dir. ) This also means that you need a TP-Link style image for the 750r2, which to be honest is no bad thing. However, it also means that the bootloader doesn&#039;t set some things up correctly ( took me more than a day to work out why I couldn&#039;t get the LEDs to work. ) I don&#039;t have a QCA9533 datasheet, so my patch currently just writes a load of registers to the values they have on boot with Mikrotik&#039;s bootloader - most of these are probably not needed but again I&#039;d lost the will a bit by that point!</p><p>One interesting thing is that the Breed bootloader can write the entire flash in less than a minute, whereas OpenWRT takes more than 5 minutes using dd or mtd write - would be good to know why.</p><p>Anyway, I&#039;m hoping that a &quot;real&quot; OpenWRT developer can take this and use it to create &quot;proper&quot; support in OpenWRT - but for now this works and is relatively easy to do... it&#039;s just a bit messy.</p><p>Instructions, code and patches <a href="https://goo.gl/5sTzqP">here.</a> Usual caveats apply about being careful not to brick your router and me not being liable for it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />. Probably best if someone experienced tries it first and feeds back....</p>									</div>

					<p>Hmm, I have to admit I don&#039;t know what&#039;s wrong - I&#039;ve just followed my own instructions to make sure and it worked fine.

					<p>Yes, the serial console works. There are pads on the board for it - they&#039;re TTL level so you&#039;ll need a TTL serial adaptor.</p><p>As to your question, there is 16M of flash on that device. The rootfs is compressed ( it&#039;s a squashfs filesystem ) and is read only - so its size is entirely related to the size of the packages it contains. When you write the image, you have to write it to the partition called &quot;firmware&quot;, which is the whole flash minus the boot loader. From memory, &quot;firmware&quot; is mtd5 - but check by doing a cat /proc/mtd</p><p>You can also write the image using:</p><p>mtd write &lt;image filename&gt; firmware</p>									</div>

					<p>I did try making yaffs2 work at one point but couldn&#039;t get it to work properly unless I patched in the whole of the Mikrotik version of the Yaffs code, and didn&#039;t really have the time to look into why.</p><p>The flash layout is actually very similar to the example <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/flash.layout">here</a>, except that the flash is 16M. So, you have a read only squashfs file system, and an overlay jffs2 filesystem, which makes it look as though you can write to the root ( but writes actually go to the overlay in the jffs2 part. ) If you upgrade the box by writing a new image to firmware, you can use the -j option of mtd write to add a saved settings tar containing files from the overlay that you want to keep. This is all pretty standard and similar to other OpenWRT boxes with NOR flash.</p><p>Unfortunately I don&#039;t really have time to do too much with this now, but will answer questions if I can.</p>									</div>

					<p>Annoyingly I&#039;m not getting email updates for this thread so sorry for the late reply.</p><p>What I mean is that I used yaffs from the Mikrotik kernel patch that they supply. I had to just modify it so that it worked with the newer kernel, but in reality I just completely replaced the fs/yaffs2 directory of OpenWRT with the one from their patch. That did work, but the box still wouldn&#039;t boot from flash, so I abandoned it ( really replacing the whole of the yaffs code with a different fork of it is not an option. ) The squashfs + jffs2 solution works well and is the way all other OpenWRT NOR flash devices work, so I had no real reason to re-try that once I&#039;d worked out that the MT boot loader was snafu.</p><p>I think that my modified version of Mikrotik&#039;s YAFFS code is in the OldStuff directory within the directory I linked to in the first post.</p>									</div>

					<p>I wrote a port for the Mikrotik hAP ( rb952-hb ) which uses the same SPI chip as the hEX I believe.</p><p>Earlier this year I was able to patch the yaffs mikrotik modification to OpenWRT for the Mikrotik mAP2n ( <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=54221">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=54221</a> ) You can review my patches here.
