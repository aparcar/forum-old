					<p>I have a Netgear DG834GT which I have just installed openwrt &quot;Backfire 10.03.1-rc5&quot; on by following the instructions here: <br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/dg834gt">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/dg834gt</a></p><p>I want to use the router to connect to my home wireless (WEP) and share it out (masquerade rather than route I think) to my wired machines.</p><p>The atheros wireless in the device by default did not appear to work at all, even after doing</p><p>opkg install kmod-ath9k</p><p>This installed the modules (froze first time actually, but I re-did it after a reboot), but no interface ever appeared.

					<p>Ok, so I swapped the module for a rt2500, which comes up as wlan0. Everything worked straight away - awesome!</p><p>It would be a good idea though to have some way to support changing the interface names... I spent all day confused by this, then once I had a card that is wlan0 instead of eth2 everything worked in 5 minutes!</p>									</div>
