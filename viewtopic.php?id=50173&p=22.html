It will support a dual wan failover configuration. It supports IEEE 802.1Q port-based VLANs. The driver you linked provides the Marvell Distributed Switch Architecture driver for switch configuration.&nbsp; OpenWRT uses <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/swconfig">swconfig</a>.&nbsp; Hopefully swconfig can be updated to support the switch. You can use /etc/init.d/mrvlswitch provided in the patch to setup the switch if you can decipher it.</p><p>Here is what you can do with the sysfs driver:<br/>cat help&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - show this help<br/>cat stats&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- show statistics for switch all ports info<br/>cat status&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - show switch status<br/>echo p r t&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; reg_r&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - read switch register.&nbsp; t: 1-phy, 2-port, 3-global, 4-global2, 5-smi<br/>echo p r t v &gt; reg_w&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - write switch register. t: 1-phy, 2-port, 3-global, 4-global2, 5-smi</p><p>The help will output to stdout.&nbsp; The others will output to your logs.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ducphuc</strong> on 26 Jul 2014, 02:32)</p>

					<p>I would like to ask if linksys uploaded the source code or just an img file. Also would compiling these wireless drivers against the most recent kernel be beneficial? or would it be better to compile it against the 3.10 (which BB is compiled against)?</p>									</div>

Once we have done some spot checks on the driver, I will see if I can get approval to post it as well ( no promises ).</p></blockquote></div><p>So?
