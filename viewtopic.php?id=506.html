					<p>I&#039;ve recently got a new WRT54GS. I fairly quickly put OpenWRT on it, as I wanted more control over the box.</p><p>What I want to do is have the lan ports work for straight internet access, so that my desktops can get a public IP address from my ISP. Any wlan clients I want to&nbsp; get NATted addresses from the Linksys.</p><p>To do this, I did these settings in NVRAM:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>nvram set lan_ifname=vlan0
nvram set wifi_ifname=eth1
nvram set wifi_proto=static
nvram set wifi_ipaddr=192.168.1.2
nvram set wifi_netmask=255.255.255.0</code></pre></div><p>And told dnsmasq to serve only eth1. This works partly. Wlan clients get an IP address from the box, but can&#039;t ping or connect anywhere, even 192.168.1.2.</p><p>Wired clients work fine, but only if I connect my ADSL box (which is a bridge) to any of the Linksys LAN ports. The WAN port doesn&#039;t work for this. It does get an IP address from my ISP, though.</p><p>So what did I do wrong? I thought this should be fairly simple.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hmm, 30+ views but no replies? Is this really so radical? Or maybe I didn&#039;t give enough information.</p><p>I read a lot of other posts and one of them mentioned overlapping subnets being problematic. So setting eth1 to 192.168.1.2 while vlan0 is 192.168.1.1, is apparently a bad idea. I set eth1 to 192.168.2.1 with netmask 255.255.255.0 on both and it works now.</p>									</div>
