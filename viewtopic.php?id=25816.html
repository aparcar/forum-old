					<p>I converted an Asus WL-520GU into an internet radio following the directions found here: <a href="http://mightyohm.com/blog/2008/10/building-a-wifi-radio-part-1-introduction/">http://mightyohm.com/blog/2008/10/build â€¦ roduction/</a></p><p>It provides an OpenWRT image that has all(most) of the necessary components built into it as well as providing directions on how to it yourself from scratch. I loosely followed the directions and made my own unit that is battery operated and mobile. I can get the WL-520GU to connect to any SINGLE router in wireless bridge mode, and it works beautifully as an internet radio.</p><p>My first and primary question is: How do I configure the wireless bridge to connect to any one of a number of wireless AP&#039;s that I would provide to it in advance? I want to be able to take the unit home or to work or a friends place..etc and for it to automatically connect to the nearby network that it has credentials for.</p><p>My second question: Would it be possible to configure the WL-520GU to connect to ANY nearby wireless AP that does not have encryption enabled?</p><p>Thanks for the help!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>marksan</strong> on 25 Jul 2010, 20:14)</p>

					<p>I too would like to have my OpenWRT client station automatically connect to any usable access point in the area.&nbsp; I have been investigating the use of wpa_supplicant to do so, as a result I have found this thread.</p><p>The example code posted by Schugy above appears to be a configuration for running wpa_supplicant on a Linux host and allowing it to connect to any of several APs.&nbsp; I would like to run wpa_supplicant under OpenWRT in client mode, I believe that the original poster was intending to do so as well.&nbsp; </p><p>Maybe I have missed something, but OpenWRT does not seem to make use of an &quot;interfaces&quot; file for its network configuration.&nbsp; Could anyone clarify the configuration of wpa_supplicant under OpenWRT?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
