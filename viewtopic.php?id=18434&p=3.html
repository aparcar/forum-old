The problem will be where do you get the image from. If it&#039;s built in, all is good. If not, can you compile it yourself?</p><p>It&#039;s not hard to compile (there are lots of good instructions), but without knowledge of things like crosscompiling, understanding flash and the memory layout, serial console, and Linux basics, it will eventually fail if you are a bit unlucky. It&#039;s as easy as compiling a kernel/image without Ethernet driver. WLAN is not configured, and Ethernet is dead. Not easy to fix.</p><p>This is all not really difficult in my opinion, but it&#039;s not dead-simple either.</p><p>Better start using OpenWRT with a well supported router, not with one where you should compile your first image yourself (as the one from RoundSparrow is a bit aged now).</p><p>That&#039;s my opinion though.</p>									</div>

Configure with the modules you like as needed. In the LuCI components menu, select ddns. See the lack of ftp here (at least on my config), so I guess LuCI cannot handle/configure ftpd.</p><p>Things to watch out when compiling your own images: It&#039;s a good start to use a known working .config file. The one from RoundSparrow are ok (a bit old though). Then do &quot;make oldconfig&quot; to get the new options integrated. Then &quot;make menuconfig&quot; to change them all. Do not deselect things you don&#039;t know what they do. If you add something, make sure it&#039;s needed, otherwise you waste space (but nothing else, so adding unknown modules is usually ok and not dangerous).</p><p>For the initial firmware update, use the .webgui file which will show up in bin/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-mzk-w04nu-squashfs.webui. Later updating requires the .bin file (see <a href="http://harald.studiokubota.com/wordpress/index.php/2009/12/19/mzk-w04nu-openwrt/)">http://harald.studiokubota.com/wordpres … -openwrt/)</a></p><p>I hope this helps to get this started.</p>									</div>
