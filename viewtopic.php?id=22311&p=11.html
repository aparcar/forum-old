					<p>Here are two torrents for a recent WNDR3700 build, based on trunk revision 20254 (current as of a day or so ago). Help with seeding the torrents is always appreciated.</p><p><a href="http://wndr3700.nfshost.com/openwrt-wndr3700-factory-r20254.torrent">Torrent: r20254 factory upgrade version (for routers that are still running stock NETGEAR firmware)</a><br/><a href="http://wndr3700.nfshost.com/openwrt-wndr3700-sysupgrade-r20254.torrent">Torrent: r20254 &quot;sysupgrade&quot; version (for routers that are already running an older version of OpenWrt)</a></p><p>These images are primarily built using a static configuration, meaning that they should work with wireless and other major features enabled from the first boot. Don&#039;t forget to adjust the country option for both radios in /etc/config/wireless to set up your proper regulatory region.</p><p>Aside from all of the goodness that was added in the OpenWrt trunk, the following configuration items differ between this build and the torrent from last month:</p><p>- added support for external rootfs<br/>- ath9k debugging mode turned off<br/>- added UPnP/NAT-PMP</p><p>The only code differences between this build and trunk 20254 are:</p><p>- this build includes the antenna /proc filesystem patch from <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/6533">ticket 6533</a>. See the Trac ticket for information on how to use it to adjust the antenna GPIOs.<br/>- this build uses a modified /lib/wifi/mac80211.sh so that the wireless interfaces are brought up at first boot</p><p>If you want to use the .config for this build as your own base, you can also download it here:</p><p><a href="http://wndr3700.nfshost.com/config-20254">http://wndr3700.nfshost.com/config-20254</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Just FYI on the leds I have never seen my usb led light up even with a drive hooked up to it. You must specifically select the wndr3700 usb led config if I remember correctly which I have done during build. Not sure if there is something I need to setup to get it to actually work as the other leds work out of the box. I was to busy messing with nfs and samba to worry about it.</p>									</div>

					<p>napierzaza,</p><p>Buttons are controlled through the hotplug system.</p><p>Drop in a file called /etc/hotplug.d/button/01-button-press and place something like the following in it as a demo:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>echo button: $BUTTON, action: $ACTION &gt;&gt;/tmp/buttons.log</code></pre></div><p>You can then write your own scripts as appropriate. Incidentally, I believe that the reset button (inset) on the back of the router is also shunted through the hotplug system.</p><p>As far as napierzaza&#039;s LAN/WAN question:</p><p>I am not an expert on the switch stuff (check in with ase!)...but my potentially-incorrect understanding of the architecture based on past posts is that the WAN port is not part of the main switch at all, and that traffic between LAN and WAN has to first transit the processor.</p><p>With that in mind, perhaps you can consider bridging the interfaces together instead. (If you want to go that route, note that the default busybox version of brctl is functionality-crippled, but a fully-functional version of brctl is installable via opkg in package &quot;bridge&quot;.)</p><p>To skarlson:</p><p>I also believe that the USB LED module simply installs kernel support for the LED. It&#039;s up to userland programs to tell it when you want it on or off.</p><p>For example:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># Turn on the USB LED solid
echo &quot;255&quot; &gt;/sys/devices/platform/wndr3700-led-usb/leds/wndr3700:green:usb/brightness

# Wait 10 seconds
sleep 10

# Turn off the USB LED
echo &quot;0&quot; &gt;/sys/devices/platform/wndr3700-led-usb/leds/wndr3700:green:usb/brightness

sleep 5

# Now make the LED blink continuously 250 ms on, 500 ms off, 250 ms on, 500 ms off, ...
echo &quot;timer&quot; &gt;/sys/devices/platform/wndr3700-led-usb/leds/wndr3700:green:usb/trigger
echo &quot;250&quot; &gt;/sys/devices/platform/wndr3700-led-usb/leds/wndr3700:green:usb/delay_on
echo &quot;500&quot; &gt;/sys/devices/platform/wndr3700-led-usb/leds/wndr3700:green:usb/delay_on</code></pre></div><p>I should add that I haven&#039;t done any research to see whether or not the default OpenWrt install has any hooks in SAMBA or the USB-hotplug system to look for or use the LED. I guess that&#039;s someone&#039;s next project...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>essdz</strong> on 20 Mar 2010, 03:25)</p>

					<p>can you detail a little more how you can turn various LEDS on and off?

This is the same with the stock firmware. Funny thing is, there is a 3rd MAC in the flash, right in the middle between the two used.

Full details are <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=105183#p105183">here</a>, but I just wanted to warn everyone that <strong>if you use wireless encryption, multiple virtual interfaces on the same radio WILL NOT WORK PROPERLY <em>if you also rely on bridging wireless traffic to the switch</em></strong> on the WNDR3700. This seems to be due to a lack of functionality in the ath9k driver (for all platforms it supports), so it&#039;s not a problem with the WNDR3700 or OpenWrt itself.</p><p>There is a easy hack you can use to make it work, but the trade-off is a ~90% loss in wireless performance...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>essdz</strong> on 25 Mar 2010, 18:40)</p>
