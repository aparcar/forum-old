					<p>I apologize if this was covered in another post somewhere else, but I&#039;m not sure what else to try.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;m using White Russian 0.9 with webif^2.&nbsp; I am trying to configure firewall rules via the interface under Network --&gt; Firewall, however, it appears that all of the rules are being ignored by iptables (or at least the forward rules).&nbsp; To test, I made a rule to forward all traffic on port 10022 to the IP address of my main server.&nbsp; After running /etc/init.d/S35firewall, I then attempted to establish an ssh connection to the port from a computer outside my network which resulted in a time out.&nbsp; Attempting to ssh over the standard port 22, got me to the router however.&nbsp; </p><p>Doing an iptables --list | grep 10022 to see if the port showed up anywhere in the iptables rules, it returned nothing.</p><p>Does this mean that the Firewall GUI in webif^2 is broken and its time to break down and learn iptables command line syntax or is there something obvious I am missing?</p>									</div>
