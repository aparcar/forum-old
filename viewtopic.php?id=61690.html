					<p>I&#039;m working on project for home control system (lights, doors, rediators etc.)<br />I have almost made it and decide to share some of my work in case, if someone wanna develop it.</p><p>it is all based on leds placed on TP-Link TL-WR740N v4/v5 each led control a relay, you can control easily about 8-9 relays.<br />Relays are arduino low level triggered relays.</p><p>I will post the hardware modification part, it work very stable for over a year.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://urlstat.eu/rc8_bb.png" alt="PunBB bbcode test" /></span></p><p>Comments on above image are writen in Bulgarian, so let me translate it. Leds 1 and 6 use GND for control signal, so for them I use photocouper. GND (it is actualy voltage -) and voltage + are taken directly from router power plug. Screw terminals on right side is 2 for 1, they are totally 12 not 24, just drawing software have this *BUG</p><p>From there on you need just to make your own script to make that leds light when u want to <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> have fun</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nedoskiv</strong> on 22 Dec 2015, 16:19)</p>
