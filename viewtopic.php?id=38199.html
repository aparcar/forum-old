					<p>Hey guys.</p><p>I try this thing since weeks without success. I guess, you are my last resort. I&#039;m so confused after all that headache that I even don&#039;t know what I should ask you guys next... </p><p>The goal is that all my internet traffic goes over my server in the USA. But this seems quite difficult. Anyway, I tried many settings without any success - the vpn connection won&#039;t be able to enable. I&#039;m not sure if I did some mistakes by creating all those necessary files (like router.crt, router.key, ca.crt, and dh.pem). I also tried the following link (maybe the most promising of all) <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.client.openvpn.tun">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.c â€¦ penvpn.tun</a>, but without success, as expected. After countless attempts I decided to start from scratch &#039;cause I actually didn&#039;t know if I had damaged the firmware.</p><p>Well, that&#039;s the story. I hope you guys have some infos that I wasn&#039;t able to find.&nbsp; Additional I have a few infos left for you: The VPN-Server runs on Ubuntu 11.04 32bit with one of this custom virtual server kernels (GNU/Linux 2.6.18-308.el5.028stab099.3ent i686). The tun/tap device is enabled on the server and I&#039;m able to tunnel thou the OpenVPN application &quot;OpenVPN Connect&quot; with username/password (whitout certificates) on my Windows PC. On the router, a TP-Link TL-WR1043ND, I run Backfire (10.03.1, r29592) with luci-app-openvpn. </p><p>Kind Regards, Steward</p>									</div>
