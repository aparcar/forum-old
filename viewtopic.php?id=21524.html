					<p>Last Friday the server changed to 78.24.191.177 but several people have seen problems with the propagation of the new IP address<br />through dns world-wide for all prefixes before .openwrt.org.<br />I had a problem with www. until yesterday, others have reported problems with svn. and you with downloads</p><p>You can overrule the dns server of your provider by defining 78.24.191.177 downloads.openwrt.org in the &#039;hosts&#039; file. <br />When the time to live of the dns setting expires it will probably get updated in your provider? dns server with the correct address.</p><p>Proper procedure before changing an IP address would be to first shorten the validity period for the old address forcing more frequent refreshment of cached values, <br />then change it, and then extend the validity period again for the new address. But apparently it was not or could not be done that way. The dns records contain a validity <br />period of an entire week so if the last refresh was done just before the change it may take until coming Friday before your provider&#039;? dns server decides not to use the cached <br />value but instead do a look-up from the authoritative dns server.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>doddel</strong> on 26 Aug 2009, 14:24)</p>

					<p>Thanks a lot for your answer! I might try that. I guess its the same as with the svn server in the other post then. (sometimes I also have some problems accessing this forum)</p><p>I actually found a mirror <a href="http://ftp.roedu.net/mirrors/openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09.1/brcm-2.4/packages/">http://ftp.roedu.net/mirrors/openwrt.or â€¦ /packages/</a> and manually downloaded the packages I needed from there, it worked fine!</p><p>Now I just need to find out why mmc mod is not mounting at boot, but that&#039;s another issue.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, apparently that is my problem too. I can&#039;t access downloads.openwrt.org, via the command line or by browser. Everything else seems to work.</p>									</div>
