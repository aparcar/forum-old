					<p>I&#039;m very interested in this project. I wanted to know how you&#039;ll have utilized your wgt634u besides normal web surfing? (ex- network printing, voip, etc) Let me know what you&#039;ll have done. Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I don&#039;t think you&#039;d find anything I&#039;ve done with the WGT634U all that terribly interesting; I primarily use one of them as a router via wireless to the router that has the Internet connection.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure what happened with leau, but I haven&#039;t had any problems with &quot;bricking&quot; the units - the only way I could see doing that is if you used the mtd, flash or similar command to overwrite the boot loader.&nbsp; I&#039;ve made a few interesting builds that didn&#039;t work quite so good, but using the serial console you should be able to take care of the problem.&nbsp; Personally, I think the unit is a good starter unit as I believe all (mine did) include a serial console header on the PCB so you don&#039;t have to mess with soldering a header or wires (that can get interesting).&nbsp; Get the USB cable from the Wiki Page and go to CompUSA and buy their sound card cable kit (it has the 4 pin connector included), strip some wire, twist&#039;em and you&#039;re in business.&nbsp; Kamikazee for the post part has been pretty reliable on the unit in my experience, but as the documentation says, make the serial console cable - personally, I think anybody who doesn&#039;t make a serial console cable or isn&#039;t prepared to is being a bit foolish or has too much money to burn...</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve bought 4 (re-furbed).&nbsp; &nbsp;Two are running OpenWGT, booting and running off external 2.0 USB drives.&nbsp; &nbsp;One has a Buffalo 160Gig, the other has a 80Gig Seagate.&nbsp; &nbsp;Both are running Samba, and being used as a workgroup File servers.&nbsp; Both have the full build chain installed, so I can compile anything I need.</p><p>Number three is a utility machine, it boots OpenWGT off a USB 512meg flash drive, again with the full build chain, just a smaller environment, and not have&nbsp; to lug the external drive around.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>The 4th bricked on me, and I&#039;m going to use the previous one, with some leads going between the comm ports to get into the CFE, if it&#039;s still alive, and see if I can bring it back to life.</p><p>So far, I&#039;m pretty pleased with the usefulness of the boxes.</p><p>Bill</p>									</div>

					<p>I use one WGT634U unit as the client for a wireless WDS bridge, so I can connect my KiSS DVD player to my network without having to put cables. The AP is a WRT54G v2.1. The 634 is running Kamikaze build, while the Linksys is running Whiterussion RC5. Works like a charm.</p><p>Datalore</p>									</div>
