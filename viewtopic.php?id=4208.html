					<p>I&#039;m trying to build a Samba backup domain controller (BDC) on top of OpenWRT (ASUS router + external USB stick).</p><p>The aim is to replace old PCs (that break) running Samba + OpenLDAP with OpenWRT&#039;ed routers running the same.</p><p>I already compiled Samba 3.0.21a and OpenLDAP 2.3.18 for OpenWRT, and they work fine [1].</p><p>As far as I understand, Samba needs to &quot;resolve users&quot; from the LDAP, i.e., see them as system users.<br />It&#039;s not a problem to do so on a PC, where it is done using Name Service Switch (NSS), but is quite hard to achieve on a router running OpenWRT.</p><p>Can a router running OpenWRT be configured to use NSS (i.e., to get users/groups not only from /etc/passwd and /etc/group, but also from the LDAP server)?</p><br /><p>[1] OpenLDAP is needed, as user adding/editing/management is done on a central primary domain controller (PDC), which is then replicated to all BDCs (routers running OpenWRT in that case).</p>									</div>
