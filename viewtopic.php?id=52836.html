					<p>Hello guys,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to mirror the Wifi-traffic on my WR710N to the lan port.<br />I&#039;m was following the tutorial found at <a href="http://backreference.org/2014/06/17/port-mirroring-with-linux-bridges/">http://backreference.org/2014/06/17/por … x-bridges/</a> .</p><p>First I did remove the lan port (eth1 in my case) from br-lan and created an extra unmanaged interface for it, called &quot;mon&quot;</p><p>On my computer I removed the ip address from the network interface put it in promisc mode and started wireshark</p><br /><p>Then on the router I set up the mirroring by entering </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># tc qdisc add dev wlan0 ingress

# tc filter add dev wlan0 parent ffff: \
    protocol all \
    u32 match u8 0 0 \
    action mirred egress mirror dev eth1
 </code></pre></div><p>and </p><br /><div class="codebox"><pre><code># tc qdisc add dev wlan0 handle 1: root prio


# tc filter add dev wlan0 parent 1: \
    protocol all \
    u32 match u8 0 0 \
    action mirred egress mirror dev eth1</code></pre></div><p>It did not work. This means I don&#039;t receive any packets on my computer and even the Link led (orange one) on the network port doesnt blink. </p><br /><p>When I try to examine the traffic on eth1 on the router with tcpdump i.e.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># tcpdump -i eth1</code></pre></div><p>I can see the full traffic from the wifi.</p><p>And now begins the strange part:</p><p>If I only enable one side of the mirror, that is when I enable only one filter (i tried both), the packets are transmitted to my computer and I can examine unidirectional traffic (either A-&gt;B or B-&gt;A but not both). Tcpdump in that case also show only one side of the traffic.</p><p>What could be the cause of this behavior?</p><p>It looks to me that the packets are dropped somewhere in the router which prevents them from being transmitted at all.<br />Ifconfig on my computer and the router dont show any drops or collisions neither.</p><p>The traffic I tested with was internet radio with a datarate of 30kB/s so it shouldn&#039;t be any problem.</p><p>Could it be a problem with the integrated switch?<br />How could I get more debug output on this?</p><p>Thanks for the help</p>									</div>

					<p>As far I can tell, this problem is hardware related.</p><p>I tried the same port mirroring technique on a computer running arch, and it works flawlessy.</p><p>I tried relaying the traffic&nbsp; through an Intermediate Function Block (ifb), so i had only one stream to the real interface, but no luck, packets are still not being physically transmitted (tcpdump works).</p><p>Link to ar9331 datasheet:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.openhacks.com/uploadsproductos/ar9331_datasheet.pdf">http://www.openhacks.com/uploadsproduct … asheet.pdf</a></p><p>I do not know how to solve that problem since it seems hardware related.<br /> But what is going wrong?</p>									</div>
