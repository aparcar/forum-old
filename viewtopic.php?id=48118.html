					<p>last night i flashed a &quot;snapshot build&quot; to my e3000 from the trunk...i dont know if i did that right. but anyway, i did the passwd setting and then installed luci. i found allot of things were missing so i went to look for them in openwrts package list.&nbsp; i felt i may have flashed the wrong firmware so i flashed the bcm47xx attitude adjustment instead and that left my router bricked with a steady power light on. did a serial recovery and now im back on dd-wrt. </p><p>i read on some places that openwrt for the e3000 is still in &quot;beta&quot; or &quot;experimental&quot; stages? should i wait if thats so? or just try again?</p><p>also, i want to try out openwrt because every time new experimental dd-wrt builds come out, they result in a brick with k2.6 and with firmware sizes being too big for 8mb routers with k3.x. so i decided to give openwrt a spin and see how it works out for me.</p>									</div>

					<p>BB is the next planned release.
