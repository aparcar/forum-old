					<p>I&#039;ve setup my openWRT box as the dhcp server as well as the dns server. At one time I had another dns server x.x.x.3. I changed that to x.x.x.1, my openWRT. This change is reflected in my webif settings and in nvram under lan_dns. Both places are disaplying the change correctly but when a wlan user connects and gets assigned an ip address, the dns server gets set to x.x.x.3 instead of x.x.x.1. Can anyone tell me why this might be happening?</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, we try :-) If he uses both DHCP options to point to his OpenWrt router, it should work too, right? And since he &quot;had another DNS&quot; it&#039;s also quite possible that he configured exactly the options I pointed to and just forgot that he did?</p>									</div>

					<p>Here is my dnsmasq.conf file. I changed the settings like the previous post said and restarted the dns server as well as restarting the whole router. Still when a wireless device connects it gets a dns server of 192.168.1.3.

					<p>Well, looks like the config has a strange dhcp-range for starters. Try the following:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dhcp-range=192.168.1.100,192.168.1.250,255.255.255.0,12h</code></pre></div><p>I assume that your OpenWrt system is the 192.168.1.1? Then you should not try to assign that IP as first address of your DHCP-Pool.</p><p>Also, did you try to explicitely reload dhcp settings on the client end? Like under windows with &quot;ipconfig /release&quot; and &quot;ipconfig /renew&quot; or whatever your client documentation states?</p><p>If that doesn&#039;t work, try to comment out tha last 2 lines in the dnsmasq.conf completely.</p>									</div>
