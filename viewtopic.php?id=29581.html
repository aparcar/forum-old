					<p>Seems that openntpd is not a best solution since it causes many problems. I followed all advices I could find but still no results <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /></p><p>So I tried ntpd but again encountered a problem. This time after starting ntpclient I get:<br />rejected packet: LI==3<br />and the client does not adjust it&#039;s time to server&#039;s time...<br />From the RFC spec I found that LI=3 in SNTP means that the server has not synchronized its clock to any other server. And because my server (router#1) is not synchronized to any other server, my client (router#2) won&#039;t synch with #1 and will print &quot;rejected packet: LI==3&quot;.<br />Well, the thing is that I don&#039;t want #1 to synchronize to anyone. My routers connect only with each other and don&#039;t have internet connection.</p><p>Can anyone help me?<br />I ONLY WANT MY ROUTER#1 TO SYNCHRONIZE ITS DATE AND TIME WITH ROUTER#2 AUTOMATICALLY AFTER EACH STARTUP WITHOUT NEED OF CONNECTION TO ANY NTP SERVER IN THE INTERNET.</p><p>It&#039;s such a simple thing but I failed to find a solution... How can I use ntpd and ntpclient to get what I need or what workaround can I employ instead of using NTP protocol?</p><p>Many thanks in advance.<br />drobiazg</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi cptdondo!</p><p>Thanks for your reply, but looks like chrony doesn&#039;t work because of the same reason ntpd didn&#039;t work.</p><p>I installed chrony on both routers and changed /etc/config/ntpd files. On the &quot;time serving&quot; side was:<br /># Generic NTP configuration<br /># Time servers and network(s) that may access the time service</p><p>config ntpd<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option TimeServers&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;0.openwrt.pool.ntp.org 1.openwrt.pool.ntp.org 2.openwrt.pool.ntp.org 3.openwrt.pool.ntp.org&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ClientAccessFrom &quot;wifi wifi900&quot;</p><br /><p>and on the &quot;client&quot; side:<br /># Generic NTP configuration<br /># Time servers and network(s) that may access the time service</p><p>config ntpd<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option TimeServers&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;192.168.3.1&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ClientAccessFrom &quot;lan&quot;</p><br /><p>The problem is that in the /etc/init.d/ntpd before starting the whole process there&#039;s a line:<br />while chronyc tracking | grep &#039;Reference ID.*0.0.0.0&#039; &gt;/dev/null ; do sleep 1; done<br />For me it looks like waiting for synchronization with another time server and this won&#039;t happen without internet connection... So the script stucks.</p><p>I tried removing list of time servers from /etc/config/ntpd - no results, script still stucked.<br />Also tried removing this waiting line from /etc/init.d/ntpd - no results, script finally not stucked and finished but no time synchronization observed after that.<br />Also tried installing ntpclient instead of chrony on the client side - agin no results, command `ntpclient -s -h 192.168.3.1` prints out:<br />recvfrom: Connection refused</p><p>HOW SHOULD I CONFIGURE CHRONY?</p>									</div>

					<p>If you can get GPS signals, I&#039;d get a $30 GPS puck, install gpsd, and sync the time to the gps as the primary clock and the internet as the backup.&nbsp; That&#039;s my setup and it works 100% of the time.</p>									</div>

					<p>There are lots of reasons that the openntp ntpd might terminate at startup.<br />One way to narrow the problem down is to start ntpd manually undaemonized,<br />doing this will start the daemon in foreground and provide more detailed info to stderr.</p><br /><div class="codebox"><pre><code> root@xyzzy:~# /usr/sbin/ntpd -sd</code></pre></div><p>I got an error that included this line:<br /><strong>fatal: client_query socket: Address family not supported by protocol</strong> (That&#039;s EAFNOSUPPORT)<br />The cause was that openntp attempts to open an AF_INET6 socket.&nbsp; My kernel didn&#039;t support <br />that protocol because I didn&#039;t include the kmod-ipv6 package (actually I&#039;d pulled it to save space).<br />So you might include kmod-ipv6, if it isn&#039;t already installed.</p>									</div>
