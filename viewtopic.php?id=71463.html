					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I need a build of OpenWRT for a linksys WRT1200ac (Marvell Armada 385 88F6820) which has EAP-FAST support compiled into wpa_supplicant as I need this feature to 802.1x authenticate to my wired WAN. The pre-built image does not have this enabled.</p><p>So I am attempting to build this image myself with support for EAP FAST in wpa_supplicant, I have followed the steps here: (wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build)</p><p>I used a fresh EC2 instance running Ubuntu 16 LTS and everything appeared to work as expected, I used make menuconfig and made the following configuration changes:</p><p>Target System: (Marvell Armada 37x/38x/XP)</p><p>Made the following configuration changes:</p><p>Removed:</p><p>Network-&gt;wpa_supplicant*<br />Network-&gt;wpad-mini</p><p>Added:</p><p>wpad</p><p>This seemed to work and a set of images was produced in bin/mvebu, I tried flashing this one on my Linksys WRT1200ac via the web interface on the Linksys firmware:</p><p>filename: openwrt-mvebu-armada-385-linksys-cobra-squashfs-factory.img</p><p>After rebooting, my router just has a solid power light I can&#039;t connect to it via any of the lan ports though the lan lights will show when you connect a cable. At this point all I can do is hard reset it to use the prior flashed image.</p><p>My question is, is there anything I can do to validate the built image prior to flashing it? Or is there a way I could get more debugging info after flashing/loading it? I don&#039;t have any problems flashing this pre-built image:</p><p>chaos_calmer/15.05.1/mvebu/generic/openwrt-15.05.1-mvebu-armada-385-linksys-cobra-squashfs-factory.img</p><p>So I am assuming my image has either an invalid combination of configurations and/or something is wrong with my build system. Appreciate any suggestions, thank you</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zugdud</strong> on 11 Jul 2017, 16:36)</p>

					<p>Ah I see, many thanks!</p><p>I did the 30/30/30 method to roll back to the old firmware and then using the web interface I tried to upload this stable image:</p><p>downloads.lede-project.org/releases/17.01.2/targets/mvebu/generic/lede-17.01.2-mvebu-linksys-wrt1200ac-squashfs-factory.img</p><p>However, I&#039;m having the same issue as before, I get an activity light for the lan port but no lan connection. When I wireshark the interface on my computer there is nothing on the wire but DHCP requests being sent by my computer. Trying a manual address (192.168.1.100/24) and nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24 also reveals my computer as the only host that is up. </p><p>Anyway, atleast this helps clear some things up for me, I guess I&#039;ll try the lede-17.01.2-mvebu-linksys-wrt1200ac-squashfs-factory.img<br /> again using a fresh router just to rule that out</p>									</div>

					<p>You are flashing from the Linksys OEM firmware, right?</p><p>Talk about non-existent 30/30/30 stuff makes me think that you might be using dd-wrt...<br />(Openwrt and LEDE store settings on the file system in the flash, so there is no 30/30/30).</p><p>If you are flashing from a running Openwrt (or LEDE), you need to flash with the sysupgrade image instead of factory image.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Hnyman,</p><p>Sorry for the late replay, I just wanted to let you know that thanks to your advice I was able to get my router working as intended. ended up using LEDE 17.02.1 and was able to install wpad via opkg, I then was able to authenticate with wpa_supplicant (using eap-fast )on my wan. </p><p>I have shared this configuration with a few of my colleges who will likely run the same setup.</p><p>Many thanks!</p>									</div>
