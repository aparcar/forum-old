					<p>@lizby</p><p>thank you so much for all this explanation.&nbsp; My 703n is ordered, I am waiting for it right now.<br />I plan to use it as an indoor Blimp controller (through wifi, from a small laptop, it is also why weigh was so important for me); I expect to embed a camera on it and stream &quot;a live stream&quot;.<br />I would like to stream a &quot;good quality live stream&quot; (at 20fps at least but better will be 30fps).</p><p>From your experience, do you think the limitation to stream at 20fps come from the USB controller (not fast enough) ?, the processor (not fast enough) or the Wifi connection ?</p><p>Thanks again.</p>									</div>

					<p>@medvedutka </p><p>Sounded like you might have an airborne application.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know why streaming is not working well with the WR703N.&nbsp; As I mentioned, it&#039;s working fine with an NSLU2, about comparable in speed, same usb connection, also streaming over wifi.&nbsp; </p><p>I&#039;m going to try streaming with &quot;motion&quot;, and will also see if adding back in some webcam_www helper code that I omitted will help.&nbsp; A self-built version is compiling as I type.</p>									</div>
