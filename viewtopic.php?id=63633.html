					<p>Hey! I&#039;m new here and not sure if that&#039;s the right forum, but I give it a try <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Anyone know if there is a working image out there? I saw the news&nbsp; (<a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=63415">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=63415</a>) and thought that finally an official image would work, but I bricked my TP-Link. <br />I was able to recovery it via FTPT. So I guess this page still says the truth: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr941nd">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr941nd</a></p><p>I used the following image: <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05.1/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-15.05.1-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr941nd-v6-squashfs-factory.bin">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal … actory.bin</a></p><p>Thank you very much!

					<p>If the buildbot is building images for this model of router that bricks them, perhaps a trouble ticket should be filed?&nbsp; Better not to publish a bricking firmware on the downloads website -- I would hope there would be general agreement.&nbsp; Disable that target until it&#039;s patched properly?</p><p>It seems that this patch:</p><p><a href="http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/504451/">http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/504451/</a></p><p>is only partial.&nbsp; Anyone willing to crack one open, hook up serial, and post output for developers to look at?&nbsp; Perhaps they can patch the patch, it already may be close to working? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Clemmitt</p>									</div>

					<p>Even pictures of the internal board and the markings on the chips would be helpful to understand what&#039;s going on.&nbsp; There was also an issue with some tp-link devices where they used a newer flash chip that wasn&#039;t supported in CC.&nbsp; Since you have tftp flashing working, try a trunk snapshot to see if it is the new flash chip issue.</p>									</div>
