I have a tplink wr841n v8.2<br /> I flashed the router like it said on the blog. post. Put a password on it It was working great 4 wifi devices 2 lan devices all logged and filtered. Had a break food is what was needed. Unfortunatly i got way laid that evening. Went back to it the following day with cubox pc.......NO INTERNET no connection to anywhere. Nothong on the other pc.s <br />Went back to use it the following day as i was busy with otherthings only to find out.(and here is the strange thing) On my samsung 10.1 i can logon to the tp link but do nothing, in other words my pad sees the router, i can put the password in but when i try for the web nothing........web page not found. I am currently trying allthe 192.168.xxx.xxx numbers to see if i can enter the user screen. Is this whats called bricked or is there sonething i cannot find lol I have tried the 30.30.30 ihave tried the reset button (i dont think the reset button is working) is there something else to try. I bought a newrouter but would love to keep trying to get the tplink working. Oh whenthe wan link is plugged in the light flashes like its gonna take off, triedleaving it over night likethat but it was still sending sos bleaps to planet mars.</p>									</div>

					<p>Something changed. Forgive me for stating the obvious.<br />I suggest you enter failsafe mode (instructions on the WiKi) and then telnet in to 192.168.1.1. then run &quot;firstboot&quot; (without the &quot;&quot;)<br />That will take you back to where you were just after flashing.</p><p>EDIT: damned spell checker firstboot NOT first boot</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>robthebrew</strong> on 17 May 2013, 18:07)</p>
