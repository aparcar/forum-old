					<p>hi,</p><br /><p>my openwrt setup is working like a charm, very nice software. but i would like to get access to my ISP&#039;S router (speedport W710V - germany)</p><p>to disable wlan for example.</p><p>since the openwrt router wan port is connected to the router/modem, how do i do that?</p>									</div>

					<p>Try using an ethernet cable for connecting one of the openwrt router&#039;s lan port to one of the modem-router&#039;s lan port.<br />If the two devices are on the same network, you should be able to reach them both.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t think connecting the 2 routers lan interfaces will work. Look at the WAN status on your OpenWRT router and use the IP of the WAN Gateway.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey there</p><p>You can pot the W710V in two modes.</p><p>One is the &quot;router mode&quot; where it holds your ISPs public IP on its WAN interface and addigns its own private subnet on the LAN side. You connect the OpenWRT with its WAN side to the LAN side of the W710V, so the WAN port of the OpenWRT has one of the private subnet IPs of the W710V router.</p><p>The other one is the &quot;modem mode&quot; where you pass-through the DSL modem feature to LAN. In this situation the OpenWRT holds your ISPs external IP.</p><p>In both situation your OpenWRT provides its own private IP subnet on its LAN side. If the W710V is in &quot;router mode&quot; the OpenWRT needs to use a different IP subnet for its LAN side as it has on the WAN side.</p><p>You need to put your ISPs router to that &quot;router mode&quot;. That&#039;s the only way to access the router through routing. If it&#039;s in &quot;modem mode&quot; then it is not related to IP routing to your OpenWRT device in any way, thus you cannot access its interface.</p><p>If you put your W710V to &quot;router mode&quot;, just open your OpenWRT LuCI, look up its &quot;WAN address&quot;. That obviously isn&#039;t your ISPs IP but something private, too.</p><p>I would guess:<br />* OpenWRT: 192.168.0.1<br />* OpenWRT provides via DHCP: 192.168.0.100-192.168.0.150<br />* W710V: 192.168.1.1<br />* W710V provies via DHCP: 192.168.1.50-192.168.100<br />* OpenWRT on its WAN side: 192.168.1.50</p><p>If you have something like that:<br />* Access OpenWRT on 192.168.0.1<br />* Access W710V on 192.168.1.1</p><p>The actual numbers might be different, but you hopefully get the schema.</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>									</div>

					<p>the wan ip is 62.x.x.x, so the router is probably acting as a modem.</p><p>can i assume that the wlan is disabled in this mode?<br />there are a few other wlans around and i dont know if my device is one of them....this setup is working for about 10 years now so i have no clue how it was setup.</p><p>the thing is i did not find a way to change the operation mode via google. they say that you can switch to &quot;modem-mode&quot; from the web interface....but not the other way around.</p><p>since i cant get into the web interface......i probably have to reset the device.</p>									</div>

InSSIDer for Windows, Wifi Analyzer for Android, there is something for every OS. Look at the MAC address(es) that should be printed on a label on your modem, and compare it to the results of your scan. If you don&#039;t see it, it&#039;s not broadcasting.</p><p>Note that the MAC address printed on the label may not match the MAC address of the Wi-Fi radio, but it will be close. The label could be AA:BB:CC:00:32:F7, the Wi-Fi radio might be AA:BB:CC:00:32:F8 or something close.</p><p>You can use this method to check, but if it is indeed broadcasting you will probably have to reset it to be able to configure it.</p>									</div>
