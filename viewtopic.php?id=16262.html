					<p>Hi, first, appologies that I&#039;m not up-to-speed on OpenWRT, but I&#039;ve been a long time user, but always just following the guides.</p><p>Have got another WRT54GL, wanted a 2.6 kernel (for reasons that aren&#039;t important here), downloaded&nbsp; openwrt-wrt54g-2.6-squashfs.bin&nbsp; from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/7.09/brcm47xx-2.6/openwrt-wrt54g-2.6-squashfs.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/7 â€¦ uashfs.bin</a></p><p>Reflashed all fine, booted, logged in, set passwd, etc, etc. Everything working fine.</p><p>Problem is, when I press the SES button (aka Cisco Systems button), the router appears to crash/lockup.</p><p>Symptoms:<br />Pressing SES button causes instant disconnect on SSH session, and router stops responding to pings</p><p>Tests done:<br />Have created a hotplug button event, that fires, the event is<br />echo &quot;1&quot; &gt; /proc/diag/led/ses_white<br />sleep 1<br />echo &quot;0&quot; &gt; /proc/diag/led/ses_white</p><p>Result is the white light turns on, and stays on. This implies the kernel/cpu has crashed, as even if it were something wierd like the network stack turning off, the code should still run and one second later turn off.</p><p>Rebooting (power out and back in) restarts router and it works fine (until I get bored and press the SES button again).</p><p>I&#039;d like to use the SES button, like I do on WhiteRussian, to control firewall scripts.</p><p>Any help, or any RTFM its a known problem with known fixes here, would be great.</p><p>Thanks<br />Nick</p>									</div>

					<p>Oh, and just a quick update: Also happens with Reset button (as I&#039;d expect).<br />The router is stock standard, so I have no way to monitor the serial console.<br />And yes, I&#039;m aware that with the 2.6 kernel, wireless won&#039;t work (and nor do I care, as I have another WRT54GL that does wireless).</p>									</div>

					<p>I just registered, basically to ask exactly the same question! Although I&#039;d searched yesterday, I wasn&#039;t able to find anything on my symptom, or a fix.</p><p>Hardware here is a brand new linksys WRT54GL, hardware version 1.1.<br />Downloaded the current firmware on monday and flashed.</p><p>root@OpenWrt:~# uname -a<br />Linux OpenWrt 2.6.22 #2 Sun Sep 30 20:38:47 CEST 2007 mips unknown</p><p>I have identical symptoms to you - pressing either reset or ses button instantly terminates all ssh sessions into the box, it no longer responds to pings or httpd requests.</p><p>I too, tried to set up a hotplug handler for it but I&#039;m not sure that it even gets that far.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; if [ `cat /proc/diag/led/ses_white` -eq 0 ]; then<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; echo 1 &gt; /proc/diag/led/ses_white<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; else<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; echo 0 &gt; /proc/diag/led/ses_white<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; fi</p><p>Really basic, not even clever. Works if I run it from the CLI, but seems to die before it even executes as the white LED doesn&#039;t come on before the thing crashes.</p><p>Only thing I&#039;ve found to bring it back from the dead has been a powercycle.</p><p>Did anyone find any cause (or more importantly, cure) for this?</p><p>(I want to actually use the button with an opto to signal an event from remote sites, so have 10 of these to make in a hurry)</p>									</div>

					<p>This one seems to have been around for a while now, with no suggestions or ideas?</p><p>Has anyone else had this working with a WRT54GL V1.1 hardware?</p><p>I&#039;m fairly new to Kamikaze and wondering if the &quot;fix&quot; will be to go to an older, perhaps more stable version? Can anyone who has tried this confirm the buttons do (or don&#039;t) work in any particular version of Kamikaze with my hardware, as I really need to move forward with my project.</p><p>Thanks in advance, anyone!</p>									</div>
