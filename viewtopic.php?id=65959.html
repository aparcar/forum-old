					<p>So, I wanted to install OpenWrt or DD-WRT on my TP-Link TL-WA901ND 300 mbps access point, but unfortunately I ran into the famous error 18005:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Error code: 18005 Upgrade unsuccessfully because the version of the upgraded file was incorrect. Please check the file name.</code></pre></div><p>After a lot of search, I realized it had something to do with new US regulations for routers, thus they would not allow other firmware to be installed. So, I found the factory-to-ddwrt-US.bin which is recommended, but when I used it it gave me a new error 18001: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Error code: 18001 Upgrade unsuccessfully because the length of the upgraded file is incorrect. Please check the file name.</code></pre></div><p>Then I stumbled upon a thread <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=1033565#1033565">http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic. … 65#1033565</a> which had a link to the ftp site of beta releases of ddwrt <a href="ftp://ftp.dd-wrt.com/betas/2016/">ftp://ftp.dd-wrt.com/betas/2016/</a>, and I picked the latest beta release for my router <a href="ftp://ftp.dd-wrt.com/betas/2016/07-01-2016-r30082/tplink_tl-wa901ndv3/">ftp://ftp.dd-wrt.com/betas/2016/07-01-2 … wa901ndv3/</a> and it worked perfectly!</p><p>Just thought to share this as not a lot of info is available for this on the internet <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> I believe similar TP Link routers can be flashed with the latest beta releases.</p>									</div>
