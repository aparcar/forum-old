					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a TP-Link Archer C7 v2.0 and for some reason it refuses to boot properly. When I connect to its serial console and power it on, I see just a few lines of U-Boot and then the output stops:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>U-Boot 1.1.4 (Dec 17 2013 - 16:37:27)

ap135 - Scorpion 1.0DRAM:  
sri
Scorpion 1.0
ath_ddr_initial_config(211): (32bit) ddr1 init</code></pre></div><p>The boot process seems to be halted there and typing does not cause any characters to be printed back. However, <em>sometimes</em> when I power on the router with the WPS/Reset button pressed, I get slightly different output:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>U-Boot 1.1.4 (Dec 17 2013 - 16:37:27)

ap135 - Scorpion 1.0DRAM:
sri
Scorpion 1.0
ath_ddr_initial_config(178): (32bit) ddr2 init
tap = 0x00000003
Tap (low, high) = (0x4, 0x1f)
Tap values = (0x11, 0x11, 0x11, 0x11)
128 MB</code></pre></div><p>which looks more like a reference boot log from the device&#039;s wiki: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/archer-c5-c7-wdr7500">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/ar … c7-wdr7500</a>. The output still stops at that point and I am still not able to get any characters printed back when I type.</p><p>What is worth noticing is that the line with </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ath_ddr_initial_config</code></pre></div><p> has changed. Instead of ddr1, it makes a reference to ddr2. The boot log at the device&#039;s wiki shows ddr2 as well. So, it looks like the DDR memory is sometimes initialized to ddr1 and sometimes to ddr2. It does not look right to me, but I have no experience or knowledge in the matter.</p><p>I assume the only way to debug and fix this is to use JTAG. I would welcome some advices on how to set it up properly. I have the following JTAG adapter:<br /><a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Freeshipping-C62-Programmer-CPLD-FPGA-download-cable-Downloader-Altera-USB-Blaster/1320685138.html">http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Freeship … 85138.html</a><br />but it only has 10 pins (i.e. no nTRST, nSRST or DINT pins). Do you know if it would be possible to use it with the router&#039;s 14 pin EJTAG port? I have read some articles which mention the need for nSRST pin at some boot stage, because (supposedly) otherwise JTAG interface might not be working. But they were referring to different devices and I am not sure if the same or similar principle would apply here as well or not.</p><p>Anyway, I can get some other JTAG adapter if needed, but even if I had JTAG connection fully set up and working, what should I do then? My goal is &quot;just&quot; to make the router work again. I can use openocd or UrJTAG, but none seem to ship with the configuration files for the router&#039;s board. So, I would have to write it on my own, but I do not have experience in that. In fact, a few days ago I did not even know what JTAG is.</p><p>So, I would like to ask if someone has made a successful JTAG connection to this router&#039;s board. If yes, can you please describe your approach and share your settings?</p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>Maybe it is relevant, maybe not, but I have tried to reboot the router multiple times and watched the serial output to see how it behaves. On top of the above mentioned boot logs, I managed to obtain another slightly different one:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>U-Boot 1.1.4 (Dec 17 2013 - 16:37:27)

128 MB</code></pre></div><p>It does not seem to matter whether I have the WPS/Reset button pressed or not during the power on. I can get all kinds of boot logs mentioned here with roughly the same probability.</p><p>Notice that with the last boot log, the &quot;Tap (low, high)&quot; have changed and so have &quot;Tap values&quot; (from 0x11 to 0x12). I am not sure what that means, but it points to more nondeterminism that is happening when reading the relevant registers during the U-Boot phase. Whether it is caused by some short-circuit or something else I do not know, but it probably affects multiple registers (or other places used for decision making during U-Boot) and disallows it to successfully continue.</p>									</div>
