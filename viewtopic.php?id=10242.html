					<p>Hi. I installed OpenWRT on my WRT-54gl around august 06, and it has been working great so far. That was until stupid me wanted to play with the VLAN settings, in order to use all 5 ports as a switch. This somehowed screwed everything up; no contact with the router via any of the ports, and wireless had already been disabled by me. So I went to your site, and found a guide to enter failsafe. Tcpdump showed packets coming in, it was entering failsafe, and the DMZ-light flashes happily, however, when I try to connect via telnet to 192.168.1.1 (my ip set to 192.168.1.2), it just gives me &quot;Login failed&quot;. nmap is showing that port 23 is happily open, but I still can&#039;t connect. I also can&#039;t upload a new firmware via tftp, no response, and I&#039;ve tried probably around 50 times.</p><p>I would appreciate it if anyone have any ideas, so that I won&#039;t have to buy another router due to my ignorance.</p><p>-bepe86</p>									</div>
