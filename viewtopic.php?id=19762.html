					<p>I&#039;m having a Dlink-DIR300 here with an SVN-OpenWRT-version 14849 with applied ip175c-switch-patches. On two LAN-Ports the router is announcing IPv4/v6-addresses with radvd and dnsmasq (eth0.4). The router&#039;s WAN-port is dedicated for internet-connections and/or ssh connections. This port is also set up to get an IPv4/v6 address by DHCP or radvd. Usually I have a DHCP server here at home, but it would also be useful feature for me if I could give the WAN-Port an IP address over its own eth0.4 interface without having to modify the software/firmware, just by pluging in a cable betwenn those LAN-ports and the WAN-port.</p><p>Although the router is able to receive IPv4/v6-addresses from my notebook when I&#039;m running radvd or dnsmasq on it, the router itself does not seem to be able to receive something form its other LAN-ports. Does the switch-chip itself falsely detect a loop because of such a cable and is therefore not pushing any traffic through this cable? Or is this a bug in the switch-driver? Any suggestions how I could get it working?</p><p>Cheers, T_X</p>									</div>
