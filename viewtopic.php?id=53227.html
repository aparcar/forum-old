					<p>Well, I using it for now without problems.<br />Usually you have one wpa-enterprise protected network interface, one non-encrypted interface for guests and management for AP itself.

One for private use (connected to br-lan) and the other one for guests (connected to br-guest). Both are encrypted WIFIs.<br />With dynamic vlans, i expected to use one SSID and put guest users to a guest vlan (only wan access) and some users in the private network, where they can connect to the wired network and to the AP&#039;s ssh and web interface.</p>									</div>

					<p>My changes were already approved and merged into trunk back in December. The fact you found them in r43473 is because they are already there. Openwrt has not historically done backports so they will never be available for people running 14.07 but if you try running 15.05 they should be included and no manual patching will be needed.</p><p>You would be a prime candidate to install the now available 15.05-RC1 and test that functionality!</p>									</div>
