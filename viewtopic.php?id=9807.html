					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am working on a project to control lights and devices from the internet.<br />My goal is to fit a 433mhz transmitter in a wrt54gl to control some wireless powerswitches. (<a href="http://www.gadgetgarden.nl/archives/gggkktt_klik0.jpg">http://www.gadgetgarden.nl/archives/gggkktt_klik0.jpg</a>)</p><p>These switches have a 433mhz receiver and come in different types (on/of , dim , sunscreen (up/down) )<br />thanks to a dutch forum ( <a href="http://gathering.tweakers.net/forum/list_messages/1077675">http://gathering.tweakers.net/forum/lis â€¦ es/1077675</a> ) i now have a 433mhz transmitter hooked op to a serial port.<br />and a config file for LIRC. It&#039;s working fine with WinLIRC and this config file.</p><p>The second stage was the linksys,</p><p>I bought a WRT54GL, installed Openwrt, and used &#039;esteevens&#039; LIRC package from this thread <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=735">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=735&#039;</a><br />I also had to install libgcc (ipkg install libgcc) for it to work<br />if i send the &#039;irsend SEND_ONCE klik J1ON&#039; command the DMZ Led starts flashing and the goes off again.<br />So far so good.</p><p>So i took out my soldering iron and removed the DMZ led. then i connected a wire to GPIO7. (the pin closest to the WLAN led of the DMZ Led)<br /><a href="http://nanl.de/nanl/bildchen/gpio_7_increased.jpg">http://nanl.de/nanl/bildchen/gpio_7_increased.jpg</a><br />And added 2 wires to power the 433mhz transmitter from the serial port header, ( pin 1 and 10)</p><p>I attached a Led on the wire from the GPIO 7 and the Ground, But somehow the led is now INVERTED.<br />if i execute &#039;gpio enable 7&#039; the led goes ON, en &#039;gpio disable 7&#039; turns it off again.<br />Same goes for LIRC, if i start lirc the led goed on, while sending the command it flashes rapidly and the stays on again.<br />I connected the 433mhz transmitter anyway but of course it ont word because teh signal is now inverted.</p><p>So i have the following Questions</p><p>1. Did i used the correct pins, or do i need to solder to other points on the wrt54gl<br />2. Can i invert the signal in lirc, (winlirc has this option but i can&#039;t find this option in LIRC)<br />3. With which language can i execute shell commands from a webpage in OpenWRT, PHP is probely to big for its memory ?
