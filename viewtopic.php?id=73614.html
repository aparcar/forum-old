					<p>I have a Linksys WRT1900ACS that I installed with the latest official OpenWrt release (that is, the *-factory.img file linked at openwrt.org/toh/views/toh_fwdownload). I used the same SSID and wifi key and just dropped it in place of my current router. Everything came up just fine - my computers, phone, etc all connected to wifi, my google homes did, my chromecast did. I can ssh to my server just fine, I can reach websites. I made no changes to the default preloaded settings except to change the wifi SSID and WPA2 key and turn on the radios.</p><p>However, the one thing that did not work was my chromecast. While I did verify that it is in fact connected to my network, it is not discoverable by my phone or computer - I can&#039;t cast to it. My phone (and computer) just tries to connect for a few seconds and tells me &quot;unable to connect.&quot;</p><p>I thought maybe the firewall was blocking it so I tested by killing the firewall (ssh to the router, service firewall stop). Tried connecting again, and no change.</p><p>This is a critical function for me so in the meantime I put my previous router back on my cable modem, and everything went right back to normal with chromecast functioning as expected.</p><p>I assume this is a routing problem having to do with device discovery, but I don&#039;t really know where to begin addressing this.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>woof</strong> on 22 Mar 2018, 14:54)</p>
