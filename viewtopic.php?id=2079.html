					<p>How do I clear the arp cache? It doesn&#039;t seem as if there is an arp utility. Arping doesn&#039;t seem to have that ability either. </p><p>The problem is I&#039;m roaming between two identically configured AP&#039;s and I&#039;m using static IP&#039;s. The two AP&#039;s are running stock firmware with wpa enabled and identical ssids. They are not within range of eachother. The client in this case is a linksys wrt54g running openwrt in client mode. When I get in range of the second IP, (and I&#039;m out of range of the first), WPA correctly authenticates and associates with the new bssid. I&#039;m assuming this is all happening at layer 2. Then when I try and ping the AP #2, I don&#039;t get any replies. If however I reboot the client, everything works perfectly. When I was using dhcp the roaming worked, but I can&#039;t afford the overhead of dhcp so I switched to static IP&#039;s. When I did this, all of the sudden the roaming stopped working. This makes me believe the arp cache is not being updated. I just had this thought now and haven&#039;t had a chance to reproduce the results and check the arp cache. I&#039;ll do that now and post the results. Knowing how to clear the arp cache would be useful in any case. Thanks for any help.</p>									</div>

					<p>The method above doesn&#039;t seem to do anything - the results from cat /proc/net/arp are the same before and after executing the command. What did work is dowing `ifdown eth1` then `ifup eth1` - but that took a second or two to work, and ideally I need something faster than that.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>seanf</strong> on 22 Jul 2005, 04:31)</p>
