					<p>On OpenWRT 1.0 (with dnsmasq 2.35) I could set a fixed IP address to a host based on its hostname, with this line in dnsmasq.conf:<br />dhcp-host=superman,192.168.1.25</p><p>On AA with dnsmasq 2.62-2 , the GUI allows me to insert an entry with hostname and IP address (and no MAC address specified), but after applying, nothing is added to the /var/etc/dnsmasq.conf file.</p><p>So it is a bug one or other way.</p><br /><p>Also I noted some entries that I removed (and applied) in the GUI stayed in /var/etc/dnsmasq.conf until I applied some more changes.</p>									</div>
