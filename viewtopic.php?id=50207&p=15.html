When the connector is connected to something it will disconnect the pcb antenna mechanically, so there is no need to desolder any resistors or interrupt the trace at all. Which is really neat <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />. The next thing is to find a propper male connector for this not commonly available TS-9 connector. I used a U.FL connector where I soldered a pin inside. This works pretty well. the only thing is that it will not stay on the pcb connector due the lack of friction fit. So I used some glue to fasten it.</p><p>After all the external antennas are working very well.

Leaving the modem running all the time makes no sense. Anyone tried to disable the modem on such a device?
