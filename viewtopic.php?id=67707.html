					<p>Yeah, it&#039;s a known issue.&nbsp; There are a few other threads already:</p><p>id=67538<br />id=67539</p><p>Currently, it rejects all ticket submissions and attempts to register a new account as spam.</p><p>Incidentally, the forum won&#039;t allow URLs in posts anymore, hence just the ids for the threads and not the whole URL.</p><p>To me, this signals that OpenWrt might be coming to an end as a project, but LEDE is essentially a fork with a lot of the core contributors to OpenWrt.&nbsp; Really, I wasn&#039;t paying attention to the politics of the projects, I just did my own thing with my copy of the source that I&#039;d update regularly.&nbsp; I only found out about the whole LEDE thing this week when I had an issue and wanted to report it, but found Trac unusable.&nbsp; I went here and no one else seemed to be having the problem, so I made a thread, which was hard because the forum no longer allows URLs in posts, which is extremely odd for a software project forum.&nbsp; I hit the mailing list trying to see what was going on and got a basic idea of the past few months&#039; events and couldn&#039;t believe this was all going on and vowed to follow the community more closely on whatever the next open source project I use or develop for.</p><p>Anyway, for now, you might want to download the LEDE equivalent of your OpenWrt version (or download the LEDE source and build the equivalent); most of the codebase is the same and some files still contain references to OpenWrt.&nbsp; See if you can recreate the issue on LEDE and let them know about the bug over there.&nbsp; I think they&#039;re just using a mailing list for now, but I think it&#039;s a more active project.</p><p>I&#039;d post a link for you, but... you know.</p>									</div>
