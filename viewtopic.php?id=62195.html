					<p>i have a PIA VPN, after some searching i come across OpenWRT for the RPi 2</p><p>before I jump into it, i am curious if i can set up the RPi with OpenWRT, PIA VPN and privoxy</p><p>I dont need to run my network through VPN or a single computer, just select apps on my computer and other computers, like have a dedicated Firefox just for torrent sites that are blocked in the UK or RSS feeds from specific torrent sites</p><p>so all i would have to do is put the RPi&#039;s IP and port into the socks5 proxy settings of a particular app and bingo, way to go</p><p>Thanks<br />Dan</p>									</div>

					<p>Privoxy in step one is a http filter proxy.<br />For socks5 proxy there are smaller/better solutions on the market.<br />If you really want to use Privoxy as socks5 proxy you should look at Privoxy&#039;s forum for configuration samples.<br />Have a look on CPU usage of Privoxy because on a router it can only handle a very small number of clients if running as http filter proxy.</p>									</div>

					<p>i know how to setup privoxy, but that question wasn&#039;t about privoxy, it was about asking if it can be done with OpenWRT</p><p>i said privoxy because it can be used along side ToR as a gateway</p><p>so is there any way to use OpenWRT on a RPi but not for my entire computer or entire network, just select apps from different computers</p>									</div>
