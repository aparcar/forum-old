					<p>Are you talking about transparent proxying ? Its matter of one redirect rule. <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/proxy.tinyproxy">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/proxy.tinyproxy</a><br />Transparent proxy application requires special coding design. It can get destination by calling getsockopt with SO_ORIGINAL_DST or IP6T_SO_ORIGINAL_DST - which is what well known transparent proxies do.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bolvan</strong> on 5 Apr 2016, 08:25)</p>

					<p>No, transparent proxying is not what I am looking for (as far as I know). I should have been more clear. I have NAT port forwarding working so that I can access one of my computers from the outside world using a high port that redirects to port 80 on the computer. This works great. I also have dns setup using an dyndns service so from anywhere on the internet I can go to my-server.dns.com:12345 and it will go to 192.168.1.100:80 inside my network. Well, that is not quite true, it works like that from anywhere EXCEPT for computers on my lan. They properly resolve the dns to my external IP and try to hit it but then openwrt gets confused and drops the packets and they go nowhere. I want the router to process hits to my external ip from the internal network through the firewall rules as if they came from the outside (or match the effect of that at least).</p><p>Does that make more sense?</p>									</div>

					<p>NAT reflection should work, but if for any reason it doesn&#039;t, another approach could be using a custom dns-record in your LAN. The host-record on your local DNS-server points to the LAN-IP and on an external DNS-server or dyndns-service you have your external IP-Address for the same hostname. But this won&#039;t work if you redirect to another portnumber.</p>									</div>
