					<p>For years I have been running a regular PC with 3 interfaces and Shorewall for my firewall. I had a dedicated DMZ interface and I figured I would replace this box with one of my WRT54G boxes. I wanted to keep a dedicated DMZ that would consist of 2 devices so what I did was peel off port 4 on the WRT and created a vlan2 containing only port 4 and assigned it the DMZ address that my old firewall used. I have a switch plugged in to port 4 and the DMZ devices plugged into that switch. </p><p>Now using the stock firewall script on the WRT I can ping all my LAN devices from the DMZ and I can ping the LAN and WAN interfaces on the WRT from the DMZ. I can <strong>not</strong> ping anything out on the Internet from the DMZ. I can ping the DMZ devices from the LAN and can ping out to the internet from the LAN. I can not get any traffic from the DMZ to the Internet using either the stock firewall script or the Shorewall configuration copied from my old firewall. If I run a &quot;tcpdump -i vlan1&quot; (WAN interface) and try to ping something out on the Internet from the DMZ I can see echo requests but no echo replies. </p><p>Setup:</p><p>WRT54G v2 + OpenWRT WR RC2 (latest squashfs binary)</p><p>DMZ vars:<br />dmz_enable=1<br />dmz_hwaddr=00:0C:41:D3:4F:BE<br />dmz_ifname=vlan2<br />dmz_ifnames=vlan2<br />dmz_ipaddr=172.16.214.1<br />dmz_netmask=255.255.255.0<br />dmz_proto=static</p><p>LAN vars:<br />lan_domain=<br />lan_hwaddr=00:0C:41:D3:4F:BC<br />lan_hwnames=<br />lan_ifname=br0<br />lan_ifnames=vlan0 eth1 eth2 eth3<br />lan_ipaddr=192.168.0.1<br />lan_lease=86400<br />lan_netmask=255.255.255.0<br />lan_proto=static<br />lan_stp=0<br />lan_wins=</p><p>WAN vars:<br />wan_hwaddr=00:0C:41:D3:4F:BD<br />wan_hwname=<br />wan_ifname=vlan1<br />wan_ifnames=vlan1<br />wan_mtu=1500<br />wan_proto=dhcp</p><p>VLAN vars:<br />vlan0hwname=et0<br />vlan0ports=1 2 3 5*<br />vlan1hwname=et0<br />vlan1ports=0 5<br />vlan2hwname=et0<br />vlan2ports=4 5</p><p>Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Nope, the interface is already up. Like I said I can get traffic to and from devices connected to the LAN ports from devices connected to the DMZ port. I just can&#039;t get traffic to and from the Internet from devices connected to the DMZ port (port 4 which I have put on it&#039;s own VLAN).</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, I&#039;ll check on that this evening. I&#039;m thinking it almost has to be some sort of iptables issue. I also noticed that when using my Shorewall configuration I could ssh into a machine in my DMZ from a selected machine out on the internet which is something I have configured in shorewall. I just expected to be able to use the same rules from my old firewall and just have everything work the same. It was late last night when I decided to do all this so tired eyes may also have something to do with it. Hopefully I&#039;ll spot a problem right away this evening. Will report back with more information if I can&#039;t get it to work. Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, it&#039;s definitely an iptables oversight by my part because I added the forward rule for vlan2 as you suggested and I can now ping out. I realize after looking at the included firewall script that there is no statement for the interface I created (duh, should have figured that). The MAC address does not conflict with any other interface in the list:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>br0       Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:0C:41:D3:4F:BC
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:0C:41:D3:4F:BC

vlan0     Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:0C:41:D3:4F:BC
vlan1     Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:0C:41:D3:4F:BD

					<p>Now that I have everything straight and my firewall with dedicated DMZ port working perfectly it brings up another question. How would I do the same thing on a v1.x WRT54G? I also have a v1.0 and v1.1 router. The v2 router uses the nvram vlan?ports variables. The documentation doesn&#039;t really cover what to do with v1.x routers other than it says they do not have these variables set:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Configuration#head-2d60cd0aab350454b45110352660791864c6aa39">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Con â€¦ 1864c6aa39</a></p><p>Is it just a matter of setting the variables? On an earlier version of WRT I use the adm.o kernel module and admcfg utility to do something similar, even though I never could get it working properly. Any light on this would be most appreciated!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Void Man,</p><p>Does the DMZ setup like you describe here apply to the WRT54GS v2.0? Or do I need to specify the variables differently? And what is special about port number 4?</p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>According to this chart your GS should have the same interface configuration as my G:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Configuration#head-b62c144b9886b221e0c4b870edb0dd23a7b6acab">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Con â€¦ 23a7b6acab</a></p><p>There is nothing special about port 4 other than that is the one I happened to pick from the 4 LAN ports to create another VLAN out of. I could have picked any of the 4, or more than one of the 4. I have another switch plugged into port 4 so I can have multiple machines in the DMZ.</p>									</div>

					<p>So with the WAN port connected to the NET, I can consider the 4 LAN ports as 4 different NICs and if I setup correctly, I can have 4 different local subnets, right? That&#039;s amazing.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, as you can see in the illustration it&#039;s just a smart VLAN capable/configurable 6 port switch. By default 4 of the ports are tied together in a VLAN and bridged together with the wireless interface to make the logical LAN interface. 1 of the ports is in it&#039;s own VLAN for the WAN interface and the last port is not exposed but internally connected to the physical/actual ethernet eth0 interface. All I did was take one of the 4 ports out of the LAN and created a new VLAN to become my new logical DMZ interface. It works great on my WRT54G v2.0 and is very easy to do. I just wish I could do the same thing on my v1.1 router, the hardware is different in it and the configuration and drivers are completely different. I haven&#039;t actually been successful in making it work on the 1.1 box. </p><p>Oh and yes, it is amazing! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
