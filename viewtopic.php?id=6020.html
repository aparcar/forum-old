					<p>I have a WAG54GS router on my desk and it&#039;s currently more like an expensive brick of plastic with lights. The problem is that my internet connection isn&#039;t compatible with WAG54GS. The reason to this is my ISP and their old technology (Sonera in Finland). I&#039;ve tested the device in other ADSL networks and it works just fine. I&#039;ve already informed Linksys technical support about this (and so have several other persons before me) but a new firmware just ain&#039;t coming. Doing something useful with the plastic brick would be nice.</p><p>So, I found the 1.00.08 firmware as a GPL release (current is 1.00.06) but the problem is that it ain&#039;t a good-to-go kinda firmware. It includes application source codes etc so it needs to be compiled. I just don&#039;t know how. Upgrading from 1.00.06 to 1.00.08 might help me with my problem or then it might not. There are also few applications included in the 1.00.08 firmware that could be upgraded to a newer version:</p><p>iptables 1.2.8 -&gt; 1.3.5<br />linux-atm 2.4.0 -&gt; 2.4.1<br />mini_httpd 1.17beta1 -&gt; 1.19<br />udhcp 0.9.7 -&gt; 0.9.8</p><p>Perhaps these upgradings could be also done without compiling a completely new firmware? Telnet connection is available to my router so perhaps there is a way to upgrade that way.</p><p>I&#039;ve got a Debian server running somewhere in my closet if I need to compile something but I just don&#039;t know what and how. That&#039;s where I need lots of help, help and help.</p><p> - Crnd</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Crnd</strong> on 8 Jun 2006, 01:00)</p>

					<p>ISP is using older technology and my router doesn&#039;t understand it (the problem was ATM if I remember it correct).

					<p>You can get v1.00.08 of the firmware by first downloading the GPL code from <a href="ftp://ftp.linksys.com/opensourcecode/wag54gs/1.00.08/WAG54GS_A_v1.00.08.tar.gz">here</a> and then extracting the pre-compiled firmware upgrade image file.</p><p>You don&#039;t say what OS you&#039;re running on (linux/windows/mac) but I&#039;ll assume its windows in which case once you&#039;ve downloaded the above file, do the following...</p><p>1) Get a version of winzip that supports &#039;.gz&#039; and &#039;.tar&#039; files (the latest version from the <a href="http://www.winzip.com">winzip website</a> does)<br />2) Open &#039;WAG54GS_A_v1.00.08.tar.gz&#039; in winzip and extract &#039;WAG54GS_A_v1.00.08.tar&#039;<br />3) Open &#039;WAG54GS_A_v1.00.08.tar&#039; in winzip and extract the &#039;WAG54GS_A_V1.00.08.img&#039; file<br />4) Use the firmware upgrade page on the WAG54GS to load the &#039;WAG54GS_A_V1.00.08.img&#039; file</p><p>I successfully upgraded my WAG54GS to v1.00.08 this afternoon so I can&#039;t say yet if there are any improvements/problems in this new version of the firmware. I was previously running v1.00.02 which was pre-installed on the unit when it was shipped from the factory and I had an issue with my ADSL connection being dropped every so often (requiring the WAG54GS to be rebooted) so I&#039;m hoping this newer firmware version might resolve that.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>garym71</strong> on 5 Aug 2006, 22:51)</p>

					<p>I had no problems using 1.00.08 firmware but still I wanted to upgrade to a newer version that I found, 1.00.09C. It has few new settings available but it seems to drop all wlan connections after a week of uptime so it needs to be booted.

					<p>Linksys has finally managed to give WAG54GS users a real xmas present: they released a new official firmware. The current version is 1.00.12 and can be downloaded straight from the firmware section of WAG54GS. The date on the site is wrong so don&#039;t get confused. It is 2005 and it should be 2006.</p><p>Didn&#039;t find any new menus so this is probably the official version of 1.00.09C. Working fine on my device right now.

					<p>Thanks a lot for this information. I&#039;ve reported a few bugs in the old firmware, but wasn&#039;t notified about any update. Don&#039;t know if they really fixed the bugs I&#039;ve reported. I&#039;ve fairly given up on this device and now use it in bridge mode only with a WRT54GL running OpenWRT (runs since 34 days without problems). I had to reboot the WAG54GS at least once a week because it wasn&#039;t responding over WLAN anymore, but it seems it does a good job in bridge mode.</p>									</div>

Also be sure that you&#039;ve got the zip unpacked so that you&#039;re not trying to upgrade your WAG54GS with the zip file instead of the img file. I had 1.00.09C when I upgraded to 1.00.12 and it worked fine. Didn&#039;t have any problems and my old settings remained intact. I can upload both images (1.00.08 and 1.00.09C) on an FTP server later. But you&#039;ll find 1.00.08 from Linksys&#039; web page under the GPL menu. Though you need to unpack the file but it is there. And 1.00.09C can be found from <a href="http://www.openlinksys.info">www.openlinksys.info</a> but you need to create an account there.</p>									</div>

					<p>My only problems with this device have been nonworking ADSL connection (1.00.06 firmware didn&#039;t support my ISP&#039;s hardware) and losing WLAN connection after few days of uptime. Newer firmwares fixed the ADSL connection but this WLAN problem was bugging me all the way until I got this new 1.00.12. Haven&#039;t experienced any problems with this one yet.</p><p>Those &quot;Obtain an IP address automatically&quot; settings affect only DSL connections. So the key is probably just to set manually all the settings of your table pc. It should work just fine after that especially if you&#039;ve got NAT enabled. Then the pc doesn&#039;t need to fetch any IP&#039;s anymore or anything and it&#039;ll be slightly faster.</p><p>I uploaded the firmware files and you can find those from the following address:<br /><a href="http://koti.mbnet.fi/cranda/wag54gs/">http://koti.mbnet.fi/cranda/wag54gs/</a><br />There are versions 1.00.08, 1.00.09C and 1.00.12. Unfortunately I don&#039;t have 1.00.06 firmware here on my laptop but you&#039;ll probably find that from the GPL downloads of WAG54GS. There&#039;s also the 1.00.08 firmware&#039;s GPL release.

					<p>If all the files do the same trick then it probably ain&#039;t a corrupted file either.</p><p>There are Annex A and Annex B type devices and those firmwares aren&#039;t compatible with each other. You should probably try both of these firmware versions. Go to Linksys&#039; site and choose the country from top left corner to Germany. Then go to Support and Downloads and there under Firmware you&#039;ll find v1.00.12 Annex A and Annex B versions. Can&#039;t access my WAG54GS right now so can&#039;t see if there was a place in administration window where you could see which Annex version your device is. You could check your device&#039;s bottom if there&#039;s some information about that.</p><p>But that&#039;s the best I can do. Can&#039;t think of anything more that could be the problem. Hopefully this helps.</p>									</div>
