					<p>I decided to upgrade to RC6 since the packages repository no longer worked for RC5. I don&#039;t know if this was intentional but I had RC5 and tried to install qos-scripts and the package didn&#039;t work because it was the RC6 one.</p><p>I had these problems with RC6:</p><p>- The bin distribution no longer includes pppoe. There&#039;s now a pppoe one. This wasn&#039;t explained anywhere so when I installed bin like I did for RC5 I no longer had a pppoe connection, thus no internet. To fix this I used mtd to go back to the original linksys firmware by flashing it&#039;s .bin file. I had to press the reset button for it to actually work again so I guess it copied a firmware from a ROM and mtd didn&#039;t work?</p><p>- After I installed pppoe I had no internet DNS. I changed the /etc/resolv.conf symlink to point to /tmp/resolv.conf.auto instead of /tmp/resolv.conf and that fixed it. What&#039;s the correct solution?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>had the same problem like pedrocr, after installation of the default .bin there was no pppoe. I had to explicitly install the pppoe binary. If you look at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Installing">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Installing</a> the definition of the different types of bins is a little bit confusing, because the default bin does NOT contain pppoe-</p><p>MM</p>									</div>
