					<p>This one should be simple, but I spent a while trying to figure it out.</p><p>I&#039;m using Backfire 10.03.1-rc4 and I&#039;m looking for command to reboot router. Standard things like shutdown -r and init 6 didn&#039;t work. I tried searching, but all I got were hundreds of posts where someone is rebooting router or is supposed to reboot the router by hand or web interface.</p>									</div>

					<p>Wow! Who would have guessed that you reboot using reboot! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I did actually try that at one point, but nothing seemed to happen for so long that I rebooted the router by hand. This time, I tried waiting a bit longer and it worked. </p><p>Thank you very much!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>AndrejaKo</strong> on 23 Feb 2011, 23:55)</p>
