					<p>I don&#039;t use x-wrt but for flashing from command line I think you need the raw trx image and not the .bin images. Which are you using? <br />Also, TFTP only works for a few seconds during bootup on most devices, it can be a PITA to get it to work, the timing needs to be dead on. I think most routers want the .bin type firmware images here in order for this to work. <br />If you can&#039;t get access via SSH try using telnet. Openwrt needs you to access it once via telnet and set a password to get ssh running. <br />Those are just the obvious suggestions, sorry if you already tried these.</p>									</div>

					<p>both ssh and telnet give me a &quot;connection refused&quot; error - as if the ports were closed. I have messed with the firewall... but still a no go.</p><p>the images are bins. how come the trx are not in the snapshot and on the download page?</p><p>I have had some success, but not complete, with the tftp - have the upload retried with a long time out, then i plug in the router and at the particular time the firmware is transfered. the pwr light on the router flashes and after ~6min i power cycle. but the firmware isnt upgraded.</p><p>-tom</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tomdavidson</strong> on 17 Oct 2008, 08:14)</p>

					<p>ok. used openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx&nbsp; in the webgui had a success full flash. what is the difference with openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx&nbsp; &nbsp;and openwrt-wrt54g-2.4-squashfs.bin ? Are the separate bins only needed for the factory software web gui?</p><p>after reboot, i was able to telnet and set passwd just as turingtest said and enabled ssh. nice, looks like progress. but doing a tftp firmware update to coovaap&nbsp; still doesnt work. the file uploads and acts like it is going to work, but once restarted it is cclear that the update did not work.</p>									</div>

					<p>Previously i got clean slate of openwrt, but want I want to try out is coovaAP. Tried to do an update via tftp again, following the instructions here to the &quot;t&quot; - <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Installing/TFTP">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Installing/TFTP</a><br />The funny thing is, that a few moments after I plug the wrt in, the tftp upload starts and then finishes - &quot;looks&quot; like its going to work. After 6 min I attempt to ssh - get connection refused, but when i telnet the connection times out. this one was coovaAP, so there should be a http access too, but nothing.</p>									</div>

					<p>Put the box on the shelf for a few days. Tonight I gave it another try, put this time as i ran a continuous ping, i used a short time to live and saw that 1/4 the request were timing. I have no idea why and then tried a tftp again with the smallest bin for the wrt54g - and ti worked! after reboot it had no more troubles with failed ping and I was then able to tftp the larger firmware.<br />-tom</p>									</div>
