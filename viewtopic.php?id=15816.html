					<p>Ok so long story short I regularly buy and flash routers to set up mesh networks for people... and in the stacks of routers I was flashing I mistook one of my routers, a wrt54gsv2 for a wrt54gsv7.... long and short of it I now have worthless CFE and nvram on my sv2 with no backup and a pretty blinking power light.</p><p>I built a jtag cable, and it probes fine... so all that is good to go... I just need a way to generate a new cfe and someones working nvram so I can finally get openwrt on my baby.</p><p>Anyone out there that has a sv2 that could make a CFE/nvram backup for me and a cfe.txt so I can plug in my mac address, regenerate cfe, and flash her over? </p><p>Or does anyone know of one floating online that I missed or any other ideas?</p>									</div>

					<p>Have you tried generating a new one? There are a few utils out there to do it, I thought there was a listing in the wiki here for recovery via this method. In any case searching for cfe recovery should do the trick, if not in this forum or wiki, combined with the ones at <a href="http://dd-wrt.com">http://dd-wrt.com</a> should do it. I&#039;m a bit rusty, and this is off the cuff, but I think this utility should do the job: <a href="http://www.wlan-skynet.de/download/index.shtml">http://www.wlan-skynet.de/download/index.shtml</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Tried that utility without any luck. :-( </p><p>The images it generates once flashed still give me blink of death... granted I generated it using wine... but... I remember there being commandline utilities to do it, but I am unable to find any anymore.</p>									</div>
