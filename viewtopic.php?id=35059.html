					<p>I am looking for a router that can run OpenWRT reliably, has 802.11n, at least two ethernet ports (1Gbit or 10/100), and, since I&#039;m planning on purchasing several dozen, is as inexpensive as possible (ideally, under $40); any other features are not necessary (though of course more are nice to have). I have seen positive recommendations for the Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH, but does anyone have experience with their lower-end 11N routers, such as the WHR-HP-GN or WCR-GN? </p><p>Additionally, if anyone has suggestions on where to do bulk orders of such consumer grade equipment (preferably vendors with volume discounts!) that would be great.</p>									</div>

					<p>I actually found the buyer&#039;s guide helpful, but I wanted to post anyway in case there were any recommendations for hardware not listed there or that I hadn&#039;t heard of. Thanks for the suggestions so far!</p>									</div>
