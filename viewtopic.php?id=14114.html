					<p>After reading through as much documentation on this as I could find, it still isn&#039;t clear to me which options I should pick for compiling openwrt on the&nbsp; USR5461 other than the CPU/platform.&nbsp; Is there a base .config file I can use as a starting point for this hardware?&nbsp; There is a discussion about what&#039;s included in the various Whiterussian firmware packages (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Installing?highlight=%28bin%29%7C%28micro%29">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Ins â€¦ 28micro%29</a>) (micro vs bin vs pptp) and I can use that as a general guideline, although I would still like to have a web interface which isn&#039;t in the micro list (for 2MB flash).</p><p>I also noticed that <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/817">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/817</a> has a number of images that appear to be ready to upload to the device, but there is no reference as to what is included in each of the images.&nbsp; Is there a way to deconstruct the images to determine what is included in each?</p><p>James</p>									</div>
