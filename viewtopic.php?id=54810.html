					<p>Hello,<br />I would like to use a WR703n router with OpenWrt as a file server (ftp or samba) and also providing a new WLAN - or enhancing the existing one. Currently I haven&#039;t decided yet whether to connect the WR703n to the existing network via ethernet or lan.</p><p>My problem:<br />How do I bridge to networks (wlan - wlan or lan - wlan) and still be able to access the router between the two networks with devices from both networks?</p><p>Current setup (without WR703n):<br />www --&gt; DSL Modem, Router (FritzBox 7312) --&gt; devices via LAN, WLAN</p><p>Planned setup:<br />www --&gt; DSL Modem, Router (FritzBox 7312) --&gt; devices via LAN_1, WLAN_1; WR703n with fileserver --&gt; devices via WLAN_2</p><p>My problem is: How do I program the WR703n so that <br />devices from LAN_1 / WLAN_1&nbsp; AND devices from WLAN_2 can see / access each other and the files stored on the WR703?</p><p>I have previously used the WR703 as <br />a) ethernet to WLAN bridge (all devices can see each other, but no ping to WR703 possible)<br />b) ethernet (=WAN) to WLAN (=LAN), with file server on WR703 <br />c) WLAN&nbsp; (=WAN) to WLAN + Ethernet (=LAN) also with file server</p><p>But so far I could not combine a and b or a and c.</p><p>So to repeat the question from the top:<br />How do I bridge to networks (wlan - wlan or lan - wlan) and still be able to access the in-between router from both networks?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>halfdome</strong> on 29 Dec 2014, 20:02)</p>

					<p>How are the Fritzbox and WR703N connected? By Ethernet or Wi-Fi? If Ethernet, you want a <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/bridgedap">bridged AP</a>. Shortly summarized, the FritzBox and WR703N should have IP addresses on the same subnet (e.g. 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.2), and <strong>only one of them</strong> should run a DHCP server. Either of them can do it, but only one at a time.</p><p>If they are connected by wireless, you want a <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient">routed client with relayd</a>. The WR703N will connect to the FritzBox as a client, and that client interface will be the &quot;wwan&quot; interface in the guide. To be able to access the WR703N in this configuration, you have to set a static IP address for the wwan interface (guide uses DHCP), and configure the same IP address on the relay interface (&quot;stabridge&quot; in the guide), see the bottom of the guide for this.</p>									</div>
