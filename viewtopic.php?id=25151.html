					<p>Hello,</p><p>I would like to install OpenWrt on some Linksys WRT54G v2 and WRT54GL v1.1, with some more packages than ones inside the default image ; as installing them after OpenWRT consumes too much space, I tried to build an image with ImageBuilder. First, I downloaded one from BackFire, brcm47xx architecture, then tested also the brcm-2.4, then the Kamikaze 8.09.2 with brcm-2.4 :</p><p> $ paquets=&#039;luci-app-ntpc luci-app-livestats luci-i18n-french luci-app-qos tcpdump iptraf iperf screen&#039;<br /> $ time nice make image PACKAGES=&quot;$paquets&quot;</p><p>and after one or two minutes, I get an image in bin/&lt;arch&gt;/openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin or bin/&lt;arch&gt;/openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx.</p><p>If I flash my WRT54G (or GL) with that image, either from the LUCI web interface (with .trx image), or with TFTP (with .bin image), the router doesn&#039;t work : either the Power led is always blinking (avec after 10 or 15 minutes), either it seems to finish setup, but isn&#039;t accessible : I can&#039;t ping it (on 192.168.1.1) nor get any address by DHCP. In fact, I can&#039;t do anything except re-install another image through TFTP, hopefully this works.</p><p>I thought at first it was a Backfire brcm47xx problem, but other brcm2-4 and even Kamikaze give the same result.</p><p>Do you know what I&#039;m doing wrong ? Or is there a known pitfall I missed ?</p><p>&nbsp; Thanks for any hint,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Fred</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve finally found how to build my image :<br />I thought the default list of packages used in the ImageBuilder system was one which gives the &#039;standard&#039; OpenWRT image we can download directly from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03/brcm47xx/openwrt-wrt54gs-squashfs.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 â€¦ uashfs.bin</a>, but no, default list doesn&#039;t include main packages from Luci, which gave me a system without web interface (and also without wifi driver) ! I have to add some packages to the list :</p><p>$ paquets=&#039;luci-app-ntpc luci-app-livestats luci-i18n-french luci-app-qos&nbsp; &nbsp; tcpdump&nbsp; &nbsp; luci-admin-full luci-admin-mini luci-app-firewall luci-app-initmgr luci-theme-openwrt luci libuci kmod-b43 kmod-b43legacy&#039;<br />$ time nice make image PACKAGES=&quot;$paquets&quot;</p><p>gave me a working image.</p><p>I had to remove iperf, iptraf and screen packages, else the resulting image didn&#039;t work (upgrade don&#039;t finish, or at next boot, the system doesn&#039;t seem to finish startup (power led always blinking) ; hopefully, it was always upgradable with TFTP.</p><p>I have now a working image, but stated some strange behaviours :</p><p>- configured as a client on wy AP, I can only get about 1 Mbit/s of download speed, whereas my laptop (without any external antenna) can get about 4 Mbit/s ?!</p><p>- when looking at &quot;wireless status&quot; in Luci web interface, the graph doesn&#039;t appear ...</p>									</div>
