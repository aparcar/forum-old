					<p>Hello guys, refreshing to see some progress with this device. </p><p>The device has 32 MB RAM, 8 MB flash and an Atheros wireless chip so if we can sort out the Ethernet switch and other niggles then it would really be a good device to run OpenWRT on. </p><p>Best of luck, I am busy ATM but will join you soon hopefully.</p>									</div>

					<p>Where it relates to the OpenWrt build system, the tutorials on the wiki are best (read them carefully).&nbsp; Where it&#039;s just vanilla kernel Kconfig, there should be tons of adequate tutorials out there.&nbsp; But you&#039;re probably best off posting a new thread here with a specific question (with background on what you&#039;re doing) if it&#039;s the OpenWrt system and the tutorials leave you stumped.</p>									</div>

					<p>What I knew was that my configs are filtered by at least two perl scripts to finally produce the .config, which looks like it is doing sanity checks, comparing the properties to the defined standards, something like that.
