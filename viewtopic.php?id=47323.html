					<p>Hello,<br />I have TP Link WR-703N with OpenWRT ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT (12.09, r36088).<br />I am trying to take the DNS from my 3G provider to the OpenWRT in order to resolve subdomain in the providers network.<br />When I am setting it in /tmp/resolv.conf manually it works, but it disappears after reboot.<br />I tried to set up it from the web interface in section DHCP and DNS in line &#039;Resolve file&#039; I put resolv.conf.ppp which actually contains the desired from me DNSes, but again no success.<br />If there is a way to make the OpenWRT to get the DNS directly from the 3G WAN interface please, share with me.<br />Thanks!</p>									</div>
