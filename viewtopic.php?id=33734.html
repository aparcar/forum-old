					<p>Hi all, would you knwo why there isnt a repository for old packages? I have been succesfully working on a PIRELLI Router for quite some time now running kernel 2.6.37.6. Now, all packages available on openwrt.org are for the new kernel 2.6.39.4.1 and they dont run on this one. </p><p>It would be so nice to be able to find old packages without having to start all over again...besides, updating to a new kernel doesnt seem to be a straightforward trick for this model.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Massimo</p>									</div>

					<p>For this reason the binatries for the stable versions are not updated, though the source of the stable release is being updated. =&gt; use stable or maintain an own repository on your PC. I think you only need a HTTP server.</p>									</div>
