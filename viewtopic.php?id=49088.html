					<p>Hi guys,<br />I&#039;m rather new in building openwrt firmware images, so my question may seem a bit odd. For an ubiquiti nanostation I&#039;d like to compile an image that also uses the kernel module batman-adv.&nbsp; As of today, this happens to be straight forward, once I updated the package feeds and added those needed packages to my configuration.</p><p>For this requirement, it won&#039;t be necessary to compile an image on one&#039;s own. The openwrt&#039;s repo has this per default. The problem is, that I need a kmod-batman-adv which talks batman 2013 &#039;standard&#039;. A protocol shift took place between 2013 and 2014 resulting in 2014ish batmen beeing disconnected from 2013ish batmen.</p><p>So, question is: how do I compile an image for my target with the latest batman-adv release 2013.4.x within my build system? The ideal measure would be dragging a sort of time slider to roughly mid december and kicking off a make :-)&nbsp; &nbsp;I think, this could also be seen batman independent: how do I compile an earlier release which was the most recent on a specific day?</p><p>Thanks a lot for any helpful hints/links.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>backstube</strong> on 19 Feb 2014, 14:38)</p>

					<p>You can selectively revert to and older version of a directory or file with either git or svn. I am more familiar with svn, but also git seems to enable that.</p><p>See. e.g. <br /><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=git+fetch+old+version+of+file">https://www.google.com/search?q=git+fet … on+of+file</a><br /><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/373812/rollback-file-to-much-earlier-version-using-git">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3738 … -using-git</a></p><p>So, in essence, you first update everything to today&#039;s sources, then revert/rollback/reset back the batman-adv package to the correct revision/hash you need. And then you compile the firmware (with otherwise new components except batman-adv).<br /><a href="https://github.com/openwrt-routing/packages/commits/master/batman-adv">https://github.com/openwrt-routing/pack … batman-adv</a></p><p>EDIT:<br />When thinking more, an even simpler alternative might be to just change the batman-adv Openwrt makefile to point to the correct batman-adv hash.<br /><a href="https://github.com/openwrt-routing/packages/blob/master/batman-adv/Makefile">https://github.com/openwrt-routing/pack … v/Makefile</a></p><p>But with both of those approaches you need to pay attention to the possible changes in config files, Openwrt startup commands, patches etc., which may have been changed since that revision you want. Especially the contents ot the patches directory depend directly from the underlying source revision.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 19 Feb 2014, 15:41)</p>
