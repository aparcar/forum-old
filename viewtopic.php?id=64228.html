					<p>Please go gently!</p><p>Short version - I&#039;ve bought a Netgear R8000 which I&#039;ll flash with OpenWRT and use as an AP behind a router.&nbsp; But it&#039;s my first time with OpenWRT.&nbsp; &nbsp;I need to get it from stock firmware to functional OpenWRT + webUI.</p><p>Below is what I *think* my steps are, to get set up, but I&#039;m not completely certain, and I might have missed stuff. A review by someone who knows the R8000, for stupid mistakes and n00bishness, would be very appreciated <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><ol class="decimal"><li><p>Do I flash OpenWRT using the stock firmware upgrade function (the wiki is blank for this)?</p></li><li><p>Do I need to save/dd any partitions or files for safety, which won&#039;t be correctly reinstated by reflashing netgear&#039;s stock .chk?</p></li><li><p>I&#039;ll be using wired-only during basic config and switch to wifi later (cautious but safer). For this I need to connect a router (=WAN gateway) and a laptop (running telnet/ssh). Should I use the WAN or a LAN RJ45 port for the router/gateway, and will they both automatically be &#039;seen&#039; by the software or do I need to do anything?</p></li><li><p>First login - sounds simple - login/set pw using telnet, then change to ssh to continue.</p></li><li><p>Wired networking (subnet/gateway/DNS etc) - sounds simple - follow &quot;static protocol&quot; instructions at <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network#protocol_static">uci/network</a> and <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/internet.connection">howto/internet.connection</a>. Does configuring the router/gateway port as &quot;static protocol&quot; automatically do all the defining/configuring for the basic LAN port setup as well, or do I need to separately configure the LAN ports?</p></li><li><p>Security - The wifi and WAN/gateway won&#039;t have been fully secured at first, while I&#039;m getting to grips with the basics. So I want to disable WLAN/wifi and lock down admin login/ssh/whatever at the start, while I&#039;m exploring basic setup, and enable/relax these a bit later on when I&#039;m ready to use them. How do I quickly enable/disable wifi functionality/interfaces, and restrict admin/ssh access to specific IPs/CIDRs/RJ45 ports?</p></li><li><p>WebUI - I&#039;m not expecting the build on the device page to have webUI pre-installed, but it&#039;s not clear, some pages talk about it as it it&#039;s there by default.&nbsp; Assuming it isn&#039;t, hopefully at this point I&#039;m good to go grab luci/luci-ssl if I want webUI early on.&nbsp; Is there anything else before this that I&#039;ve missed out?</p></li><li><p>Hopefully the webUI will be pretty intuitive, so I can work the rest out from there. But if I run into real problems, how do I reflash back to stock firmware from CLI or failsafe (assuming it&#039;s not bricked?)</p></li><li><p>Backing up/restoring setup - I&#039;m pretty confused about managing, backing up, and restoring the config. Even after reading the docs/wiki, what I&#039;ve understood is that config stuff gets spread round various files, may or may not be managed by UCI, needs a bit of OS knowhow, and so it might not be easy to know which files have to be backed up to rollback the device to a working or &quot;default&quot; setup. Quick tips appreciated to help me understand what this means in practice <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p></li></ol><p>I appreciate the time by forum members double checking these and helping me get going! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stilez</strong> on 17 Apr 2016, 12:03)</p>

					<p>Thanks. I meant logical use not physical location of the RJ45s (clarified in the OP). I was really looking for whether the WAN port is &quot;special&quot; or &quot;just another interface&quot;, whether it matters if the gateway is connected to a WAN or LAN port, and if the 4xLAN ports can be isolated from each other (if not, then packets could travel LAN1-&gt;switch-&gt;LAN2 without passing through the router or its rules) </p><p>I didn&#039;t know about 15.05.1 having LuCI already installed by default, I can&#039;t see anything in release notes/changelog or how it&#039;s been set up, is there a link for that? Does it need enabling from the CLI or does it automatically run at startup after first login?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stilez</strong> on 17 Apr 2016, 12:40)</p>
