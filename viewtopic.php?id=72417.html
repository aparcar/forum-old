					<p>Hi <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" />,<br />I&#039;m currently trying to set up an isolated wifi network that only gets &quot;internet access&quot; to my home network.<br />My home router is unable to isolate specific devices/ports, so I&#039;m trying to isolate the network on my OpenWrt Router. Is that at all possible? i haven&#039;t found anthing so far, would you have an idea?</p><p>Here&#039;s a topology picture (replace &quot;_&quot; with &quot;.&quot; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> ):</p><p>i_imgur.com/Wrlhmf7.png</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t think you can isolate the wifi network from your LAN if you want to access internet through the LAN, but you can block unwanted traffic in the openwrt firewall. BTW you should configure it as a NAT router and not as an access point if you want to use the firewall in openwrt.</p>									</div>

					<p>Absolutely, you can do this, IF you can set up a second LAN on your Home Router. </p><p>If your Home Router was also running OpenWrt/LEDE, then you would just set up a separate interface on one of the wired ports (call it Port 2), and connect that to the &quot;OpenWrt Router AP&quot;. You would have the Home Router issue addresses (via DHCP) and you would set up your firewall rules to not allow any traffic between the Port 2 and the rest of your private LAN. The Home Router would be doing NAT for both LANs (public and private). </p><p>Of course, if you are running IPv6, you won&#039;t be running NAT, but the rest will be the similar.</p>									</div>

					<p>Mhm, alright. Thats what i&#039;ve guessed.<br />Unfortunately the home router is really quite minimal, functionwise.<br />So i guess i can&#039;t really seperate the networks.</p><p>Could I route traffic for a wireless interface through a vpn running on my OpenWrt Router?</p>									</div>
