					<p>I&#039;m looking to build my own router using an old Foxconn NanoPC nT-i1250 Intel NM10 Black Mini / Booksize Barebone System.</p><p>I can&#039;t seem to post links here, so can&#039;t link the article I found where a guy is giving a tut on how to build a router out of a book size PC using Ubuntu Server.&nbsp; It&#039;s a bit over my head.&nbsp; However, in the article he links to this site, stating OpenWrt may be the way to go for someone like me.&nbsp; Last time I played with Linux was RedHat Linux in the late 1990&#039;s simply to run a Quake2 server, I have no Linux skills at all.</p><p>I see OpenWrt has a hardware compatibility list, but it seem it is for off the shelf routers, and I&#039;m not sure if it is something I can use to make what I want.</p><p>Any suggestions?</p><p>What I need to do is make a router to run a home network.&nbsp; The modem is a Pantech UML 290 USB modem, the network is Verizon wireless.</p><p>I found a youtube vid where a guy was able to get the Pantech UML 290 working in Linux, so I think I&#039;m all set there, just need to figure out how to actually build the router...</p>									</div>
