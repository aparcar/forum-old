					<p>Hi there,</p><p>I have the following issue.</p><p>My router is a Buffalo AG300H which was not in use for a long time and have been used to test some configurations prior.</p><br /><p>The problem is, that I can&#039;t access the device (via Telnet, SSH or HTTP).<br />As far as I know, there is a JFFS2-filesystem running on the router, so failsafe-mode is not working.</p><p>The DHCP-Server seems not to be working, both on the Wifi-network and on the LAN-ports. When I connect my laptop on the LAN-interface running WireShark I get once a DHCP-discover packet from the Buffalo. I already setup an DHCP-server, which offers a lease, but it seems, that the router is not acepting it.</p><p>When I connect the device over the WAN-port I&#039;m able to ping the assigned IP-address (via DHCP), but due to firewall policies I&#039;m not able to do a Telnet or SSH.</p><p>Any ideas, how I can access my router?<br />There would be a serial port on the board, but therefor I would need the right converters. If there is a solution on the given facts, it would be great.</p><br /><p>Thanks you in advance</p>									</div>

					<p>Part of your diagnostics was to run Wireshark to sniff out traffic associated with the router, where you indicated you saw a discover request coming from the router.</p><p>Question: is your laptop running the DHCP server?&nbsp; If not, then you won&#039;t be able to see all of the DHCP handshake, since the discover is a broadcast, which would make it to your laptop for wireshark to pick up, but the rest of the protocol would be unicast communications, of which your laptop would not be a source or destination MAC, therefore the packet would not be reaching your laptop for wireshark to pick up.&nbsp; The switch (router&#039;s switch, external switch or both) between your router, laptop and DHCP server would be directing DHCP traffic only between the DHCP server and the router.</p><p>It is possible to enter OpenWRT into failsafe mode even if JFFS is working, the trick is catching the 2 second window you have to trigger entering failsafe mode.&nbsp; That&#039;s easy with serial, since you can see the actual prompt, but understandably more difficult to catch and respond to by network, particularly if you don&#039;t know what the IP is.</p><p>By default, OpenWrt sends a UDP broadcast message from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.255 (broadcast IP for 192.168.1.0 network) port 4919.&nbsp; It is at that point it is waiting for a response from you.&nbsp; There&#039;s a special utility you&#039;re supposed to use to intercept the failsafe broadcast and provide you with the prompt to enter Failsafe.&nbsp; Even though the failsafe broadcast IP subnet might not match your LAN subnet, the UDP packet will still reach your laptop&#039;s interface through a switch, since the Ethernet destination address is also a broadcast address.&nbsp; I just tested and verified this.</p><p>Supposedly hitting any button on the router defined in OpenWrt is supposed to get you into Failsafe, but I don&#039;t see that working.&nbsp; If anything, the router enters System Halted state if a button is pressed at the moment gpio-keys-polled module is run, but by then you&#039;ve already passed the failsafe entrance window.<br />The UDP broadcast is only to signal you that it just paused for the failsafe prompt.&nbsp; It is also supposed to send as the payload &quot;Please press button now to enter failsafe&quot; but the only text I get is &quot;please&quot;, prefixed with the word 0xdead in hex.</p>									</div>
