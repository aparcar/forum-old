					<p>Down and dirty problem,</p><p>OpenWRT kernel 2.6.28, early r15000 trunk build that still had the ipt_IMQ instead of xt_IMQ. Running NodogSplash on such a combo with all the proper package dependices is proving to run traffic shaping (IMQ) on all interfaces to include eth0/eth1/wifi instead of the specified interface in the nodog conf file. This same package, running the latest NodogSplash and using a 2.6.26 kernel does not do this, works proper. </p><p>I honestly think someone with knowledge on iptable&#039;s could help me solve this, even if I have to rewrite a portion of the /etc/init.d/nodogsplash start up script.</p><p>Here is an output of tc qdisc show,</p><p>qdisc pfifo_fast 0: dev eth0 root bands 3 priomap&nbsp; 1 2 2 2 1 2 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1<br />qdisc pfifo_fast 0: dev eth1 root bands 3 priomap&nbsp; 1 2 2 2 1 2 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1<br />qdisc htb 1: dev imq0 root r2q 10 default 1 direct_packets_stat 0<br />qdisc htb 1: dev imq1 root r2q 10 default 1 direct_packets_stat 0<br />qdisc pfifo_fast 0: dev wifi0 root bands 3 priomap&nbsp; 1 2 2 2 1 2 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1</p><br /><p>Everything appear&#039;s normal, nodogsplash run&#039;s perfect and everything. Only problem is that fact all my other interfaces are subject to the IMQ reduction. I&#039;m running out of idea&#039;s, searched google for info and found mention of excluding interfaces from IMQ with iptables, but I just don&#039;t have the knowledge to correct such an issue.</p>									</div>

					<p>bump*</p><p>Just trying to further this along, i&#039;m sure someone else out there will find it useful if fixed. I got around to trying the option in Nodogsplash that is suppose to limit the traffic shaping even further to an ip range. This didn&#039;t work either and I still find that the IMQ rules/iptables rules in Nodogsplash end up finding their ways onto all interfaces of the router. </p><p>Picture this, your trying to run adhoc between routers while you have a VAP that runs in Ap mode. On that VAP, i.e ath1 you want Nodogsplash running and limiting people&#039;s bandwidth. On ath0 your running adhoc to further your network using OLSR and you want full speed between connections. While this all works perfect on 2.6.26, once you introduce any newer kernels (when trunk still used ipt_IMQ) the result is not only ath1 has speed limit, but also ath0 so that the adhoc between the two routers is subject to the Nodogsplash throttle.</p>									</div>
