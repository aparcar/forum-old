					<p>The default configuration of CC15.05 refuses to get an ip address from my modem.&nbsp; &nbsp;After poking around various forums I have uncovered this as a problem in Openwrt and DDWRT.&nbsp; &nbsp;I found this solution here in the forums:</p><p>1. Disconnect wan cable from router<br />2. Run: ifconfig eth1 down<br />3. Run: ethtool -s eth1 speed 100 duplex full <br />Requires that the package is installed, I used scp to copy the package to the router<br />4. Connect wan cable<br />5. Run: ifconfig eth1 up<br />6. Profit! smile</p><p>Which works great, but requires that I manually unplug the cable and then replug it in.&nbsp; This won&#039;t cut it during a power outage.&nbsp; &nbsp; Can anyone suggest an alternative?&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe there is a setting somewhere I can tweak that will force 100Mbps on eth1?</p><p>Credit for the fix above goes to enrique, in this thread:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=38164">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=38164</a></p><p>SORT OF SOLUTION:<br />Paste this command into the startup command list:<br />ethtool -s eth1 speed 100 duplex full<br />(doesn&#039;t always work - looking for another solution)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>motocrossmann</strong> on 8 Mar 2016, 05:23)</p>
