					<p>Hi I work at a recycling place for old ISP equipment. <br />So I get anything from a small what ever router like Zyxel to a big Cisco router to send away to get melted in to metal again.</p><p>Any way I was thinking that if I am going to recycle this equipment I might instead give the Openwrt some hardware to play with in the process. That way Openwrt could get even more hardware support.</p><p>For now I might be able to give away D-LINK DES-3528/3828 if some one in the Openwrt project would be interested.<br />I got a lot more but if there is no interest then there is no point for me to list stuff.</p>									</div>

					<p>I may not be able to do anything with this 24-port Giga switch except to use it. If you are willing to ship it out for free to GA 30047, I don&#039;t mind to accept and make use of it.</p>									</div>
