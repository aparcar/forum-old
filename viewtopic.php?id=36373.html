					<p>there is no such thing as a &quot;best supported router&quot; <br />there is a large number of routers which are fully supported in the stable release (backfire 10.3.1), and there are many routers which are (partly or fully) supported in the development-release (trunk = attitude adjustment). <br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/</a></p><p>so which router is best for you depends on your needs and your budget. <br />There are are a lot of routers with atheros-cpus which are working quite well. <br />Starting at the low end with devices like TP-Link TL-WR703N, TL-MR3220, TL-WR842ND 400MHz CPU, 32MB RAM, 4-8MB Flash, and USB, 100Mbit-Switch 20-30Euro<br />and ends with devices like the D-Link DIR-825, Netgear WNDR3800, Buffallo WZR-HP-AG300H with 680MHz CPU 64-128MB RAM, 8-32MB Flash and USB, Gigabit-Switch, Multiple Wifi-Interfaces,... for 70-100 Euro. And many many devices in between.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>regarding gpios, serial and usb-port(s):<br />on almost every router are some gpios (which are normally used for status-leds and WPS- or reset-buttons etc., which you can use for something else. most routers has only one serial-port, which is used by the console (but it&#039;s possible to change this if you compile a firmware yourself) or you can use a usb-to-serial converter (there are usb-to-rs232 and usb-to-ttl for just a few euros). </p><p>usb-ports: most routers has only one usb-port, but you can use a usb-hub.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 22 Apr 2012, 10:29)</p>
