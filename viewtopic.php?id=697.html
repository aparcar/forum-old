					<p>Has any thought been given to separating OpenWRT&#039;s device specific support from the package management system/distro?</p><p>OpenWRT is a great multi-medium (wired and wireless) router distro that currently exclusively supports Linksys&#039; WRT54G and similar devices.&nbsp; Why not separate the device dependent support (primarily sspecial kernel compiles AFAIK) from the other infrastructure that is in OpenWRT?</p><p>I&#039;ve got a P233 laptop that I would love to load up with an OpenWRT based distro.</p><p>Just a thought.</p><p>--adam</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s a nice thought, but not one that&#039;s really a high priority.</p><p>The main reason is that there are already numerous mini distributions for the pc market.</p><p>While there&#039;s nothing stopping you from using busybox, dnsmasq or dropbear on your machine I can&#039;t see the point in trying to port openwrt. Openwrt was designed specifically to meet the constraints of the WRT54G and later adapted to work on the various &quot;clone&quot; devices; while there really isn&#039;t much to openwrt itself, what is there is very specific to the platform.</p><p>You may wish to look into the uclibc buildroot tree that openwrt is based on.</p>									</div>
