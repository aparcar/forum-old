					<p>I&#039;ve been working on an AG241v2 for the last few weeks.&nbsp; It works fine using 8.09.1 or 8.09.RC2.&nbsp; I&#039;ve not managed to get an image built from trunk to work - the networking appears broken.</p><p>Flashing new firmware is done via tftp (look in the wiki).&nbsp; This is a plus because if you brick the device all you&#039;ve got to do is re-flash firmware at power-on time.</p><p>The only problem I have is with the ethernet switch.&nbsp; It&#039;s not possible to configure it in any way.&nbsp; It works fine so long as you are happy with the power-on configuration (a single VLAN).&nbsp; I need to configure a couple of port-based VLANs on it, but the driver isn&#039;t able to do it.</p><br /><p>-rdj</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rdj</strong> on 7 Oct 2009, 18:39)</p>
