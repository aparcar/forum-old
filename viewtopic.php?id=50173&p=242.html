					<p>I just pulled the trigger on a WRT1900AC on eBay and just wanted to ask what is the most stable firmware to run on this router?&nbsp; Stock or OpenWRT? I know it sounds like there has been a lot of progress lately with this firmware, but at this time I need stability over features.&nbsp; Just wanted to check in and say keep up the good work!</p>									</div>

					<p>In my opinion, the stock firmware is still a little more stable. However, it&#039;s still prone to locking up from time to time. OpenWrt rc2, is just about as stable, but there are multiple factors involved to get to that point. It&#039;s taken me a few weeks to ask questions, and learn about the software to be able to tune it, where I feel I&#039;m just about as stable as stock. However, my job deals with Linux and IP networks, so it&#039;s, sort of, up my alley to begin with. If you don&#039;t feel comfortable with linux or networking, it might feel like a daunting task to get it where you need it to be. </p><p>Here is a good read about 3 different types of open-source firmware(Tomato, DD-Wrt, and OpenWrt). Keep in mind DD-Wrt and Tomato are not currently offering supported firmware for the wrt1900ac (They claim they will soon). However, it&#039;s good to learn that there are different types that suit different needs. </p><p><a href="http://vpnpick.com/dd-wrt-vs-tomato-vs-open-wrt/">http://vpnpick.com/dd-wrt-vs-tomato-vs-open-wrt/</a></p><p>Good luck</p>									</div>
