					<p>Hi,</p><p>First time poster <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> , I have installed OpenWrt on my TP-Link TL-WR841ND v7 (Attitude Adjustment 12.09) and thinks its great!</p><p>The TL-WR841ND is a bit on the low powered side but is a nice router, Anyway.</p><p>What is the best small &amp; fast proxy server to install?</p><p>I have looked at srelay but can&#039;t find much documentation and squid has great documentation but I do not think will run well on my limited hardware.</p><p>All I want it for is so my friends in the U.S.A can use my router to watch (U.K) on-demand video site by just entering e.g MYURL.com : 3128 in foxyproxy with a user/pass.</p><p>Any ideas?</p>									</div>

					<p>With limited hardware, the most tiny solution is allowing only your friends ip addresses (instead of user/pass login) to a 80 port that redirects every connection to the destination site ip address.<br />And in your friends devices edit the /etc/hosts with your ip adress and the host of the destination site. See the &quot;rinetd&quot; package.</p>									</div>
