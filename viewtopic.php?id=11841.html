					<p>I&#039;m trying to make gpsd run when boot the system.&nbsp; I&#039;m using Kamikaze 7.07 on an NSLU2 and I can&#039;t figure out how to get it to run at startup.&nbsp; I have made a script using the guidelines in the howtos put in /etc/init.d/.&nbsp; the script is called gps and I have enabled it with a priority of 99.&nbsp; So it shows up as S99gps in /etc/rc.d/.&nbsp; If I do /etc/init.d/gps start after I&#039;m logged in everything works great and the daemon starts, but when I reboot the daemon does not start.&nbsp; The script is getting executed though, because I have an echo command that updates a text file when it runs.</p><p>gpsd is installed on a flash drive using ipkg, and I am using an absolute path in my script to make sure it can find it.</p><p>Does anyone know any other way to make it run at boot or do you know why it won&#039;t run when I reboot?</p>									</div>

					<p>BTW, I tried replacing gpsd with ser2net connecting to /dev/ttyUSB0. again it works manually but not at startup from init script. I&#039;m worried /dev/ttyUSB0 isn&#039;t available for some reason at startup. But since this is running at level 99, I&#039;m not sure why this would be the case. The only other thing this high is sysctl which I am unfamiliar with.</p>									</div>

					<p>I tried again with the sleep. This time /tmp/test.txt exists and has /dev/ttyUSB0 listed, but gpsd still did not start (ie does not appear in ps -ef). Still works starting manually.<br />Here&#039;s the modified script:<br />#!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common<br /># Copyright (C) 2006 OpenWrt.org<br />START=99</p><p>start() {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sleep 60<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ls -al /dev/ttyUSB* &gt; /tmp/test.txt<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ls -al /opt &gt; /tmp/test2.txt<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ls -al / &gt; /tmp/test3.txt<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /opt/usr/sbin/gpsd /dev/ttyUSB0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}<br />stop() {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; kill `ps -ef | grep &#039;gpsd&#039; | awk &#039;{ print $1 }&#039;`<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }</p>									</div>

					<p>ok, I&#039;ve solved my problem. For the curious out there. There is a delay before /dev/ttyUSB0 exists and also a delay before /opt is mounted. A sleep time takes care of that. I was also having an issue with my LD_LIBRARY_PATH. When I added a sleep time &amp; exported the LD_LIBRARY_PATH inside this script then all started working.</p>									</div>
