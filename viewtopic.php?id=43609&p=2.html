					<p>It has been a while since i flash this latest openwrt firmware<br />Now I remember a bit ....<br />Since I stuff a lot of module in the firmware, <br />I have to use serial port to upgrade the firmware.<br />If upgrade from web, it will need free rootfs to buffer the firmware<br />but if upgrade using serial port, will use RAM for buffer.</p>									</div>

					<p>ok that makes sense but if I recall to use the serial you have to open the case which I dont really want to mess with could i ssh in with putty, copy the file to /tmp and the issue a <br />sysupgrade -n openwrt-ar71xx-generic-xwr100-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin command?</p><p>Would that work?</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok I lied since updating everything on the staus/overview page always just reads collecting data and never displays any information. I have tried re-flashing and powering down and up the router and cant get it to display information on this page.</p><p>Not sure what else to try....</p><p>Also would you happen to have the <br />vmlinux-xwr100.uImage mtd2<br />openwrt-ar71xx-generic-root.squashfs-64k mtd<br />files that match your original version as the orginal updated that status page properly</p><p>I could even sysupdate with a sysupdate version of the original firmeware if you have that available</p><p>While the firmware works really well i need the status page to work so I can see things like dhcp leases and wan ip adress and all.</p><p>Let me know what you recommend</p>									</div>
