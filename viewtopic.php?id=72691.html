					<p>Evening all. I have a Linksys WRT1900ACS running LEDE 17.01.04. I&#039;d like to set this up so that I effectively have two networks: one for me (the WiFi and devices on an ethernet hub hanging off LAN port 4: let&#039;s call this NET1) and one for others on a seperate WiFi router hanging off LAN port 2 (let&#039;s call this NET2). I want both to have access to the Internet, but not each other. So NET1 would not see the traffic on NET 2, and vice versa, but both would have acces to the Interwebs.</p><p>Makes sense? I hope so, but I need some pointers. Could some kind soul share how to configure this, either through Luci or the command line. Comfortable in both, but VLANS make my brain hurt.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, this is relatively easy to do; I have helped some people on this forum before, who had exactly the same request, so I am pretty sure there are at least a couple of posts around here explaining how to do it.</p>									</div>

You can do this the same way<br />and reach what you asked for. :-)</p><p>Best wishes<br />AnyfiTester</p>									</div>
