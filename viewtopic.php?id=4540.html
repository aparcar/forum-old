					<p>It seems that OpenWRT&#039;s squashfs is patched with lzma and it won&#039;t mount normal squashfs images.</p><p>To make a squashfs image that will work under OpenWRT one needs a patched mksquashfs - one can be found here: <a href="http://wl500g.dyndns.org/lzma/mksquashfs-lzma">http://wl500g.dyndns.org/lzma/mksquashfs-lzma</a></p>									</div>

					<p>even with patched_kernel_squashfs-lzma ,mounting loopback could get into trouble if<br />the squashfs_image was created with &quot;nopad,noappend&quot; as showned in target/linux/image/squashfs.mk.<br />So the universal way is to :<br />dd if=image.squashfs of=/dev/mtdblock0<br />mount -tsquashfs /dev/mtdblock0 /mnt</p>									</div>
