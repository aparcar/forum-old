					<p>Hi !</p><p>I have Linksys WRT1900ACv2 and OpenWRT 15.05.1 running for a while and still having stability issues.<br />What have been done:</p><p>1) Installed watchdog script which fixes wpad / wpad-mini / hostapd stop working bug.</p><p>2) Upgraded WiFi drivers to 3.18.23+10.3.0.17-20160531-1.<br />opkg list-installed | grep mwlwifi<br />kmod-mwlwifi - 3.18.23+10.3.0.17-20160531-1</p><p>However, same issues with WiFi stability remain, they appear at random interval (connections are stalled or dropped, while OS appear still running fine).</p><p>Question is - what to do next? Routers are in working environment, there are no much time for experiments.<br />1) Is there any new WiFi fix for OpenWRT I&#039;m not aware about?</p><p>2) If I upgrade to LEDE:<br />2.a) Which version doesn&#039;t have this annoying WiFi issue? Some say for example only rc2.<br />2.b) Can I upload settings from OpenWRT, or everything have to be recreated manually from scratch? I have a LOT of custom firewall rules. <br />2.c) Do my custom scripts (watchdog, sub2rbl, fan_ctrl) will be saved or I have to upload them again?<br />2.d) Do I need to do any manipulation with bootloader not loading correct kernel after reboot? I read about it somewhere but lost link.</p><p>Thanks in advance for any suggestion(s).</p>									</div>

But you&#039;re right, these two problems might not be related at all. The symptoms might be the same but the point of failure might be completely different.</p>									</div>
