					<p>I&#039;m trying to install White Russion 1.0RC4 on my Linksys WRT54G v4 router, and I can&#039;t get it to respond to TFTP.&nbsp; I&#039;ve turned boot_wait on, the power light flashes for three seconds during power up like it&#039;s waiting, but when I try to TFTP to 192.168.1.1, I get no response.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got my PC connected to LAN port 1.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried netkit-tftp and atftp, I&#039;ve used the scripts/flash.sh script, all with no luck.&nbsp; This is the process I&#039;ve been trying:</p><p>1.&nbsp; Unplug the router&#039;s power.<br />2.&nbsp; Start scripts/flash.sh (or manual tftp as described in the docs)<br />3.&nbsp; Plug in the router.</p><p>Then script then times out and the router comes up as normal rather than receiving the new firmware.&nbsp; I&#039;ve looked through the website and haven&#039;t found anything that I might be missing.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p><p>&nbsp; -Michael</p>									</div>

					<p>You may need to connect your pc with the router through a hub or switch. Some PC only turn on the network interface like 3 seconds after it detects CD signal on the line. It&#039;s in the FAQ or Doc section of the wiki.</p>									</div>
