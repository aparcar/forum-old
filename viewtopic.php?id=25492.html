					<p>Hello everyone,<br />I was wondering what thoughts people had on gathering statistics on each network users&#039; traffic usage.<br />Specifically I&#039;m trying to find out the total number of bytes sent and received per unit time (say, per hour) for each user connected to the access point.<br />I&#039;m running Backfire 10.03 and I&#039;ve had a look through the packages and while there are a few which will do per-interface stats for me I couldn&#039;t find anything that will do per-user out of the box.</p><p>So, I started scripting and I had two thoughts..</p><p>1. <strong>Install tcpdump and use awk to gather some stats.</strong> I think it&#039;s overkill dumping and parsing each packet, but anyway.. I mean something a little like below..</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@openwrt:~# tcpdump -i br-lan -l -n -tt -K -e 2&gt; /dev/null | awk &#039;(NF&gt;5) {sent[$2] = sent[$2] + $NF; recv[$4] = recv[$4] + $NF; } END { for(i in sent) print i &quot; sent &quot; sent[i] &quot; bytes&quot;; for(i in recv) print i &quot; received &quot; recv[i] &quot; bytes&quot;;  }&#039; &amp;
root@openwrt:~# echo $!
1679
root@openwrt:~# 94:xx:xx:b2:7a:8e sent 832 bytes
00:xx:xx:a4:e8:bb sent 864 bytes
94:xx:xx:b2:7a:8e, received 864 bytes
00:xx:xx:a4:e8:bb, received 832 bytes

[1]+  Done                       tcpdump -i br-lan -l -n -tt -K -e 2&gt;/dev/null | awk &quot;(NF&gt;5) {sent[\$2] = sent[\$2] + \$NF; recv[\$4] = recv[\$4] + \$NF; } END { for(i in sent) print i \&quot; sent \&quot; sent[i] \&quot; bytes\&quot;; for(i in recv) print i \&quot; received \&quot; recv[i] \&quot; bytes\&quot;;  }&quot;
root@openwrt:~#</code></pre></div><p>The echo $! returns the PID of the awk process. I just assume that the tcpdump process is one less than this. When it&#039;s killed the stats are dumped.</p><p>I&#039;m collecting stats based on MAC address and not IP because the IP can change over time (I&#039;m not using static dhcp leases).<br />The biggest problem with this solution is that it takes the router&#039;s load to 1.00.<br />I think tcpdumping is overkill.</p><p>2. <strong>Create iptable chains for each user and get stats from iptables..</strong></p><p>Something like this (it&#039;s a little sanitised, but you get the picture)<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@openwrt:~# iptables -I FORWARD -s 192.168.1.228 -o ppp0

root@openwrt:~#</code></pre></div><p>Then, every time a udhcpd (actually I guess it&#039;s dnsmasq-dhcp) event occurs (a new user joins or leaves) each IP (and associated byte counter) is mapped to the MAC addresses (before the change) with another simple script and a tally for that MAC updated; the iptables stats are then cleared. The byte count per MAC is then reported every hour and cleared.</p><p>If I didn&#039;t want per-MAC accounting but rather per-IP accounting then I might be able to use rrdtool to do this, but since I don&#039;t want the graphs and just the numbers, I might as well write a script to do it.<br />My main issue with this solution is the need to insert two entries into iptables per IP address.. with a DHCP pool of 100 address that gets messy (ok, only 10 realistically).<br />The CPU overhead is low for this solution I think. I still need to check what impact these hooks into the iptables may have on the firewall - I insert them at the start to make sure they are traversed.</p><p>I was wondering if anyone had any comments or any other ideas on how to do this?</p><p>TIA.</p><p>jsp</p><p>PS yes, I know that the two scripts monitor different interfaces but it&#039;s just a proof of concept</p>									</div>
