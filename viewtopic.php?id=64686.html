					<p>Hi everyone , i have been struggling around this adventure here .<br />I want that my router works normally between wan dhcp and 3 lan ports , and i want to make an aditional bridge between 1 specific port on switch to wan port without interfering with the others .<br />By this it will mean that i want to recieve 2 dhcp leases on wan port .</p><p>1st dhcp lease goes to wan port , and will distribute internet over openwrt interface on port 1,2 and 3 with 192.168.xx.xx</p><p>2nd dhcp lease will be bridged between from wan to port 4 where i will use other network interface .</p><p>In alternative , i can use port 3 as 2nd WAN to be bridged to port 4 .</p><p>The meaning of this configuration is to apply some iptables rules over the bridge .</p><p>The understanding looks a little bit complicated&nbsp; but i made a draw to make it more explicit .<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://s32.postimg.org/t7434dhet/owrt.jpg" alt="http://s32.postimg.org/t7434dhet/owrt.jpg" /></span> </p><p>Anyone have an idea if it is possible to make this work in openwrt ?<br /><strong><br />Option 2</strong><br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://s32.postimg.org/h4ycowurp/option2.jpg" alt="http://s32.postimg.org/h4ycowurp/option2.jpg" /></span></p><p>Option 2 looks even more complicated right <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>To understand why it must be like this way :<br />-ISP only allows their equipment to be registered in their servers<br />- I want put some iptables rules on the ISP modem (disable remote access port from ISP)<br />- openwrt router can only get another external ip address thru port 4 of isp modem , because port 4 of the modem will be in bridged mode .</p><p>I was able to create a bridge between port 3 and port 4 , it worked normally as bridge , but if i&nbsp; connect between ONT and (openwrt port 3) and then the isp modem wan on port 4 of openwrt ISP is unable to register on ISP server .</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pedropt</strong> on 7 May 2016, 06:36)</p>

					<p>pedropt: you are challenged by the fact that you want the WAN port to both Route and Bridge at the same time. And the OpenWRT software must some how decide which to do.</p><p>I suspect you could do this with ebtables, based on destination MAC address (e.g. send a packet to the router, or your firewall), but I haven&#039;t done it. You may want to look at a similar idea, where I bridge IPv6, and route IPv4 at the same time (not quite the same thing, but it may give you some ebtables ideas).</p><p><a href="https://github.com/cvmiller/v6brouter">https://github.com/cvmiller/v6brouter</a></p><p>HTH</p>									</div>

					<div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>A dedicated computer for this job will waste 10x times energy consumption than a single router device .</p></blockquote></div><p>really.... I have a motherboard combo that barely consumes 18watts of power at full load only doing firewall tasks (pfsense). And my actual AC68u router consumes more power than this at 19-24watts depending how many devices connected through wired and wireless.</p><p>and option 2 image doesnt make sense to me to be honest. If youre bridging two interfaces, can you just connect it directly?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>remlei</strong> on 8 May 2016, 01:24)</p>

					<p>2nd image does not make sense to you because if i connect openwrt wan port directly to ONT -&gt;gigabyte it wont receive any dhcp lease&nbsp; , to get a internet i must have to connect my ISP modem witch is registered in their servers .</p><p>cvmiller :&nbsp; i will make some tests here with v6brouter to see .</p><p>I will also create a linux debian machine with nics in bridge to make some tests .</p>									</div>

					<p>pedropt: Let me clarify, v6brouter won&#039;t solve your problem. But if you look at the script, you will see a line:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ebtables -t broute -A BROUTING -p ipv4 -i $INSIDE -d $INSIDE_MAC -j DROP</code></pre></div><p>Where ebtables looks at the destination MAC address and forwards to DROP (which actually is to the stack in the broute table). I think you could do something like this to forward (bridge) your packets to the router, and another line to forward (bridge) packets to your firewall.</p><p>I found this to be very helpful (with examples):<br /><a href="http://ebtables.netfilter.org/examples/basic.html#all">http://ebtables.netfilter.org/examples/basic.html#all</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi </p><p>@pedropt</p><p>if I recall&nbsp; it was needed a&nbsp; &nbsp;dhcp vendor extension on the dhcp client&nbsp; (option 81) ,&nbsp; udhcpc can do this ??<br />if you have cli access on the thompson you can see the string need for option 81 on dhcp&gt;client&gt;config or maybe just sniff that out on the wire with another machine </p><br /><p>so you can have a much cleaner setup</p><p>report on this if you try it </p><br /><p>cheers</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>surrealiz3</strong> on 6 Nov 2016, 03:24)</p>
