I set a password and was locked out of one of my routers as well. Bottom line, you don&#039;t want to set a password after following the instructions <a href="http://my-embedded.blogspot.cz/2014/01/mini-usb-portable-3g4g-router-rt5350f.html">here</a> since this firware does not appear to contain an ssh server. You want to use wget on the mini router to upgrade the firmware to Chaos Calmer and then you can set a password.</p><p>I updated the <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/unbranded/a5-v11#installation">Wiki</a> to hopefully provide clearer instructions if you get a mini router with the English factory firmware. The Chinese factory firmware can be upgraded from the web interface. I recently obtained one with the Chinese factory firmware from banggood.com so they seem to still be available. Note that just because these instructions worked for me does not mean they will work for you.</p><p>Good Luck!</p>									</div>

Therefore,&nbsp; using your mini router&#039;s wget command is the only way to get the firmware on the mini router without opening the case. I believe that Python includes a rudimentary web server that you may be able to use on your laptop/PC to serve up the Chaos Calmer <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05/ramips/rt305x/openwrt-15.05-ramips-rt305x-a5-v11-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin">firmware</a> to your mini router&#039;s wget command.</p>									</div>

					<p>I believe this is the one I have as well.&nbsp; So, the only way to get OpenWRT without bricking is to update the boot loader?</p><p>Mine has the same limited BusyBox commands, but the shell environment has more commands not listed.&nbsp; If I do ls /bin ls /sbin and /ls/sbin&nbsp; there are all sorts of utilities available.&nbsp; It even has a Samba server on here, with USB automount, and FAT fs support (including makedosfs).&nbsp; I can just put the files on a thumb drive, and it automounts to /media/sda1.&nbsp; With that I can just copy to /tmp.</p><p>I haven&#039;t tried to update yet, in part because I&#039;m not sure if this is the same unit.&nbsp; I&#039;m also curious to look around in this firmware, because they really packed quite a bit into this 3.something MB.</p><p>One thing that concerns me about trying to update is this message in the log:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Warning: un-recognized chip ID, please update SPI driver!<br />AT25DF321(1f 47000000) (4096 Kbytes)<br />mtd .name = raspi, .size = 0x00400000 (4M) .erasesize = 0x00010000 (64K) .numeraseregions = 0<br />Creating 5 MTD partitions on &quot;raspi&quot;:<br />0x00000000-0x00400000 : &quot;ALL&quot;<br />0x00000000-0x00030000 : &quot;Bootloader&quot;<br />0x00030000-0x00040000 : &quot;Config&quot;<br />0x00040000-0x00050000 : &quot;Factory&quot;<br />0x00050000-0x01000000 : &quot;Kernel&quot;<br />mtd: partition &quot;Kernel&quot; extends beyond the end of device &quot;raspi&quot; -- size truncated to 0x3b0000</p></blockquote></div><p>I don&#039;t know much about this, but before I flash it I would like to know if it matters if these memory allocations are different than what are listed in the wiki for this device.&nbsp; Also, having the end of the kernel file truncated can&#039;t be real good for business.</p><p>For bricked units:&nbsp; I think there may be a possibility for TFTP flash on these.&nbsp; If I hold in the reset during power on, <br />it turns on both the red and blue LEDs but doesn&#039;t boot the kernel.</p><p>Another question I have is what about the similar MPRA1 OpenWrt firmware?&nbsp; Maybe that will work from the web interface flash tool?</p><p>I took some pictures:</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www.tiikoni.com/tis/view/?id=1667b02" alt="http://www.tiikoni.com/tis/view/?id=1667b02" /></span><br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www.tiikoni.com/tis/view/?id=d9b2a73" alt="http://www.tiikoni.com/tis/view/?id=d9b2a73" /></span></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>RoutyMcRouter</strong> on 20 Apr 2016, 03:37)</p>

					<p>I went ahead and flashed following the directions on the wiki.&nbsp; It went fine.&nbsp; Here are some observations while they are fresh in my mind:</p><ul><li><p>Check to make sure you have the 32MB RAM version before updating the bootloader.&nbsp; See this reference: <a href="https://github.com/Squonk42/OpenWrt-RT5350">https://github.com/Squonk42/OpenWrt-RT5350</a></p><p>In the wiki, sysupgrade -vn should be sysupgrade -v -n</p><p>I highly recommend the Python web server.&nbsp; In fact, I may do all my sysupgrades this way.&nbsp; You just navigate to a folder and run: $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer&nbsp; &nbsp; and you will see: Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...</p><p>Finally, maybe this is a personal thing, but I sort of freaked out.&nbsp; OpenWRT turns the LED to solid red when it is up and running.&nbsp; So the boot goes from blinking red to solid red. I was trying to get it into TFTP mode (successfully I believe), then I remembered there is no DHCP server so I rebooted and set static IP addresses, and there was the BB splash screen on telnet.</p></li></ul><p>I noticed the unit runs much cooler with OpenWRT 15.05.1 than it did with the stock firmware under similar CPU load and free memory</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>RoutyMcRouter</strong> on 21 Apr 2016, 15:22)</p>

					<p>I managed to get Open WRT working on mine, and have lost it again. I either set an admin password in the Web UI or hard reset it at some point. Now when you turn it on the LED glows red. Holding the reset button for 10 seconds results in both the Blue and Red LEDs lighting up. But the router doesn&#039;t show up in the DHCP tables on my home router or respond to telnet over ethernet. Any ideas? I&#039;d love to recover it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>square_eyes</strong> on 18 Jan 2018, 05:27)</p>
