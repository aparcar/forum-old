					<p>Hello,</p><p>i&#039;m trying to setup a multiradio network and use 1 card as AP, 1 card for mesh RX and 1 card for mesh TX(something like strix setups). But the problem is that i don&#039;t know how to limit the mesh cards one to do only TX and one to do only RX.</p><p>The best idea i can think of is something like this:</p><p>1. Get 2 omni antennas and 2 cards. <br />2. Plug the antennas into antenna0 on the wireless cards and leave the antenna1 plug without an antenna.<br />3. Set card1 TX to antenna0 and RX to antenna1 and card2 TX to antenna1 and RX to antenna0<br />4. Than create a bridge of this two cards</p><p>This way card1 will have strong TX signal and card2 will have strong RX signal and because they are bridged thay are going to act as one card.</p><p>I don&#039;t know if this is going to work but it makes sense to me. If someone has any documentation on this please let me know.</p><p>Regards</p>									</div>
