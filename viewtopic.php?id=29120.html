					<p>Hello, I would like to run a https server on OpenWrt (Backfire) that is visible from WAN and certified by a CA recognized by most browsers.</p><p>If I put the ssl certificate and the corresponding private key file in /etc/uhttpd.crt and /etc/uhttpd.key respectively, the site works after opening port 443 on the firewall, but browsers still complain because of the lack of the certificate chain to the trusted authoritiy.</p><p>Question: where does this certificate chain file go and how to configure it in uhttpd? Just for the reference, in Apache, it is configured by SSLCertificateChainFile.</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>

On a workstation, openssl is not an issue (it is very probably already installed). But yeah, if you have no other option (e.g. you are stuck with a wifi router and a smartphone with an ssh client but with no computer and you still want to get the work done), then px5g is the way to go.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nagydani</strong> on 16 Mar 2011, 16:08)</p>

					<p>But again, this will not get you a publicly accessible https server that browsers will accept as secure, because the certificate chain to the CA is missing.
