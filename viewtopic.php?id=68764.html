					<p>My woes with my RT3070L adapter turned out to be due to the length of the USB cable, not software. The adapters work fine on all my PCs, which leaves me with one of these three theories:</p><p>1) The D +/- voltage is weaker on these travel routers<br />2) These travel routers induce more noise into the USB cable than a PC<br />3) These travel routers use hardware that is more sensitive to noise</p><p>Can anyone confirm any of this based on their experience?</p><p>It should not be a VCC power issue because I get the same results with a powered hub that has more current available than my PC.</p><p>Since I need the long cable I think I need to try adding a second ferrite core on the router end (there is already one on the adapter end) or try a USB amplifier. I don&#039;t have either on hand but I can probably find an old cable to salvage another choke from. </p><p>Anyone have any ideas or overcame long USB runs (20 to 30 feet, IIRC standard is rated for 15 feet) with these travel routers (GL Inet family, WR703N, etc)?</p>									</div>

					<p>just install the wifi adapter next to the router and have a coaxial cable run through to your antenna, since coax cable is shielded and contains a purer copper (not 100% pure but pure enough) than the wires you used on your USB extension thing.</p>									</div>

					<p>I disagree with the poster above.&nbsp; Whenever possible, extend the baseband instead of the antenna.&nbsp; At 2.4 GHz, losses in even a few feet of good quality coax are significant.&nbsp; Cell phone towers are now mounting the radio system at the top of the tower, directly connected to the antenna, and running baseband signals over either fiber or Gb Ethernet to the network building below.</p><p>There is some really lousy wire being integrated into no-name products these days.&nbsp; Do not trust the gauge marking on the jacket, it may actually contain very little copper.</p>									</div>

					<p>you could also use a usb hub, the individual cable segments are limited to 5 meters but you can add up to 5 hubs (IIRC)&nbsp; so you could reach up to 25 meters. <br />Depending on the power requirements you could even get away with a buspowered hubs, but only testing will tell.</p>									</div>

					<p>well you can disaggree with it but face the fact that USB is not designed to work over 5 meter long cable.</p><p>It may work but I highly doubt that it would work reliably.</p>									</div>
