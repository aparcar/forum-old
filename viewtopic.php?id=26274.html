					<p>While exploring how to trigger my custom application automatically on configuration changes, I have discovered some truths that are, to me, surprising.&nbsp; I would have thought that there&#039;d be some consistency between uci on the command line, LuCI and the JSON-RPC.&nbsp; &nbsp;I could be wrong; documentation in this area is hard to come by.</p><p>uci on the command line does not automatically trigger anything as far as I can determine.&nbsp; You can use apply_config to cause the triggering.&nbsp; Apply_config is &quot;smart&quot; and will only trigger if it needs to, and will trigger anything that needs to be triggered.&nbsp; The triggers are hardcoded in /lib/config/trigger/base.lua.&nbsp; To add new ones, you must modify that file.</p><p>LuCI uses a different mechanism.&nbsp; When changes occur, LuCI calls luci-reload &lt;module&gt;,&nbsp; This is a rather &quot;dumb&quot; script, in that it will only trigger the module passed in, and will trigger it unconditionally even if there are no pending config changes.&nbsp; However, luci-reload does look at /etc/config/ucitrack, a configuration file that is much easier to extend with your own custom application.&nbsp; But although ucitrack syntax seems to support the notion of module dependencies (triggering one ought to automatically trigger another), the luci-reload script does not appear that it would honor these dependencies.</p><p>The JSON-RPC mechanism goes through the same path as LuCI, if you call the uci::apply method.</p><p>Am I missing something?&nbsp; There seems to be no consistent way to add triggering for my own application ... I would have to add it to base.lua and to ucitrack.&nbsp; And ucitrack does not seem like it completely works (dependencies).</p>									</div>

					<p>Ah.&nbsp; That didn&#039;t occur to me, but it makes sense.&nbsp; I will test it.</p><p>Still, that would only affect the system when a user ran &quot;apply_config&quot; manually, after having executed some uci commands.&nbsp; It would not affect the behavior of LuCI or json-rpc.</p><p>Seems to me that luci-reload really ought to be implemented much more like apply_config (or perhaps just call it?).&nbsp; And that an &quot;apply&quot; command be added to uci, which would mimic what rpc:uci:apply does.&nbsp; I think that would make things more consistent, no?</p><p>I understand that uci probably shouldn&#039;t automatically &quot;apply&quot;, or the existing /etc/init.d scripts might possibly break.</p><p>a</p>									</div>

					<p>Well uci triggers got introduced a year after LuCI did it and there was no time to implement it yet.</p>									</div>
