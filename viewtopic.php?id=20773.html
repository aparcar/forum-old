					<p>Hi, I know this is an old thread, but I am also interested. As I understand it, one would normally do kernel-related development offline (i.e. using the image builder, SDK, etc.), but it would be really helpful to be able to compile wifi drivers (or other things that require kernel headers) right on the device. In my case, it&#039;s a small computer -- amazon.com/Jetway-Intel-Celeron-N2930-Fanless/dp/B00OY8Q0QC -- , with 32GB mSATA module, not a typical embedded system, so storage and speed aren&#039;t really an issue.</p>									</div>
