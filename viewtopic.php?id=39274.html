					<p>Hello all,</p><p>currently OpenVPN is used as a service, but in my opinion it should be more treated as a virtual network device much like pppoe.<br />That&#039;s why I&#039;m creating a netifd/proto script that takes care of starting the openvpn instance on ifup (and kills it on ifdown).<br />This way, the tunnels are created device-specific during network initialization and a broken tunnel is automatically restarted.</p><p>Advantages of the network-interface approach:<br /> - up/down of each tunnel handled independently by network init<br /> - tunnel configuration as (virtual) network interface<br /> - easier integration in firewall zones, routing, etc.<br /> - automatic reconnect on failure/network restart</p><p>Now here&#039;s my question:<br />Do most of you think this is a good way to go or are there any disadvantages in using openvpn the same way as pppoe?</p><p>Cheers<br />Joachim</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, integrating OpenVPN as interface protocol is a good idea and we&#039;d certainly accept patches doing this.<br />However it needs some sane strategy - I do not think it would be a good idea to stuff all possible OpenVPN options into the network config, instead maybe something like &quot;config interface foo; option proto openvpn; option instance xyz&quot; where &quot;xyz&quot; would either refer to a config file, e.g. /etc/openvpn/xyz.conf or a section in /etc/config/openvpn.</p><p>One problem I see is to determine the vpn ifname in advance - unless the integration forcibly passes options like &quot;dev-type tun&quot; and &quot;dev ovpn-xyz&quot; it can get very hard to predict the device name in advance without parsing the config. Even then it might be unclear because the to-be-created tuntap iface is automatically allocated.</p><p>We could map the uci &quot;ifname&quot; option to --dev and --dev-type when launching the instance, where the type is maybe auto-determined based on the name (e.g. &quot;tun0&quot; or &quot;tun-work&quot; -&gt; &quot;tun&quot; / &quot;tap11&quot; or &quot;tap-office&quot; -&gt; &quot;tap&quot;).</p><p>There also needs to be some way to suppress harmful options from external configs, like for example &quot;redirect-gateway&quot; - that should probably get mapped to the existing &quot;defaultroute&quot; uci bool.</p>									</div>

					<p>That perfectly matches with what I&#039;ve already scripted. I also prefer the openvpn config file much more than stuffing openvpn option into uci, so up to now I&#039;ve only implemented 3 options: &#039;config&#039;, &#039;dev&#039; and &#039;dev_type&#039; (whereas the latter two are optional).</p><p>So my network config looks like:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface foo

  option config &#039;myserverconfig&#039;    (mandatory, if the value contains a &#039;/&#039; it is used as config file with full path, if not then it is searched for &#039;/etc/openvpn/${value}.conf&#039;)
  option dev &#039;vpn0&#039;      (optional: can also be specified in the config file)
  option dev_type &#039;tun&#039;       (optional: can also be specified in the config file)</code></pre></div><p>After a bit of cleanup and testing (probably today), I&#039;m going to post my files here for further discussion.</p><p>I don&#039;t see yet why it is important to know the vpn ifname in advance, everything I&#039;ve done so far doesn&#039;t require that.

My current implementation calls openvpn with the --route-noexec parameter because telling the routes to netifd in the up script additionally sets the routes which resulted in each route existing twice. So I&#039;m telling openvpn to not create any routes and totally leave that to the scripts. This might even simplify detecting and filtering hostile pushed settings. I&#039;m not even sure what the effect of a pushed &#039;redirect-gateway&#039; would be when openvpn is called with --route-noexec, will test that.</p>									</div>

					<p>Looks good so far but I&#039;d really map &quot;option dev&quot; to &quot;option ifname&quot; to keep the style of the other protocols. I&#039;d also call &quot;option dev_type&quot; something like &quot;option mode routed&quot; or &quot;option mode bridged&quot; instead.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, done that (almost). Renamed &quot;option dev&quot; to &quot;option ifname&quot;, &quot;option dev_type&quot; to &quot;option type&quot; (=routed|bridged) and added new &quot;option mode&quot; (=client|server).<br />The latter (option mode) is required because if the configuration file would create a openvpn server, it might be desirable to call client-connect and client-disconnect scripts.<br />If &quot;option mode&quot; is not specified or is set to &quot;client&quot;, the openvpn instance is started without --client-connect and --client-disconnect.</p><p>I&#039;ve also tested what happens when a &quot;redirect-gateway&quot; directive is pushed from the server. Good thing (in my opinion) is: nothing happens at all. Since openvpn is started with --route-noexec and the route creation is handled by the up script(s), openvpn doesn&#039;t try to create a new default gateway route and the up script won&#039;t either.<br />Now one can discuss if pushing a redirect-gateway directive from the server to the client must be supported - I doubt so. If one can setup the openvpn interface on the client to use the remote server as new default gateway as soon as the connection is established, that&#039;s probably enough. Why should the server decide?</p><p>Just to clarify it again: pushing routes still works, just pushing &quot;redirect-gateway&quot; (and pushing &quot;route-delay&quot;, to be honest) doesn&#039;t have effect.</p>									</div>

					<p>One final minor nitpick, the interfaces should be prefixed with &quot;ovpn&quot; instead of &quot;vpn&quot; because we might end up supporting other things like L2TP etc.<br />I could also imagine making the &quot;ifname&quot; option optional, in which case the resulting --dev would be &quot;ovpn-$cfg&quot;</p>									</div>

					<p>I have worked with it for quite some time now on different platforms and it seems very stable and reliable to me, so I guess it&#039;s time to contribute it.</p><p>The package contains lots of scripts and nothing to compile, so what would be the best approach to build a new package?<br />1. have all scripts &quot;inside&quot; of the package residing in svn<br />or 2. make svn just contain a single Makefile which downloads the scripts (in a .tar.gz file) from some site that I host?</p><p>Approach 1 seems quite difficult for me to commit it - I would have to post all the script files to the openwrt-devel list, no?<br />But it would have the advantage that everybody could contribute/modify/patch the scripts - I don&#039;t claim my scripts to be perfect.</p><p>Approach 2 would be a lot easier for me to commit and develop - I could just create new packages on my server and have them downloaded.<br />Disadvantage would be that the community has to rely on me and my hosted server.</p><p>Can anyone give me an advice which way to go?</p>									</div>
