					<p>Hi all,</p><p>surfing the web i found this: <a href="http://www.kangaroo.comcast.net">http://www.kangaroo.comcast.net</a></p><p>they made a B4 implementation based on OpenWRT (available only for a WRT54GL). I&#039;m not a great compiler, is possible to compile the package for all other hardware (i&#039;m especially interested to a common x86 architecture or vmware)</p><p>thank you all</p><p>Davide</p>									</div>

					<p>From a quick look at that site, it looks to be IPv4 support in a native IPv6 network.</p><p>Are you REALLY sure that&#039;s what you&#039;re after? Most people are after creating a Dual Stack and then having a gateway device that tunnels the IPv6 over an IPv4 network to somewhere like tunnelbroker.com.</p><p>Quite honestly I don&#039;t see the point of the link you have provided. IPv6 already provides support for IPv4 address space and there are a bunch of 6to4 gateways around if you want a native IPv6 network.<br />google for linux 6to4 gateway if you are wanting a native IPv6 network with access to IPv4 addresses. rather than dual stack.</p>									</div>
