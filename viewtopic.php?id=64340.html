					<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>I am trying to briefly turn off the link on one of the Ethernet ports (the LAN port) on an MT7620A-based board. On an older (RT305X-based) board, I would simply do:</p><p>swconfig dev rt305x port 0 set disable 1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />swconfig dev rt305x set apply </p><p>but this no longer works with the MT7620A driver. There is no &quot;disable&quot; command on the ports on that switch.</p><p>Are there any other alternatives? The reason I need to turn off the link is to propagate a &quot;network down&quot; event to a computer behind the router and have it re-request an IP via DHCP when I turn the link back on (it&#039;s a 3G router and the computer behind it needs to know when the 3G link goes down).</p><p>Thank you!<br />Razvan</p>									</div>
