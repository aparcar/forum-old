					<p>You can force the use of your DNS with a iptables rule.

					<p>By default, Chaos Calmer sets up a local domain called <strong>lan</strong> which is assigned by OpenWrt dnsmasq as per /etc/config/dhcp. For example, if you have a PC named happy which is connected to OpenWrt, its fully qualified host name becomes happy.lan.</p><p>Chaos Calmer also sets <strong>option rebind_protection &#039;1&#039;</strong> /etc/config/dhcp. This will prevent OpenWrt from using the DNS servers in /tmp/resolv.conf.auto for lookups. To correct this, set <strong>option rebind_protection &#039;0&#039;</strong> in /etc/config/dhcp.</p>									</div>
