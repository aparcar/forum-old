					<p>Hi, first post so be kind :-)</p><p>I&#039;m running LuCI Trunk (svn-r9960) on OpenWrt Barrier Breaker r39770 on Ubiquiti UAP hardware.<br />I&#039;ve installed and tested OpenWrt and the packages I need on one UAP, all working fine.<br />I&#039;ve then installed the same OpenWrt version on identical hardware then copying the configuration and packages by backing up the &quot;/overlay&quot; directory from the original UAP and restoring to the new one, changing the Router name to keep me sane.</p><p>The new UAP works OK BUT I&#039;m having problems with LuCi. The Status Overview page has missing information for System - Local Time, Up Time and Load Average. The memory stats are not populated. Network just says Collecting... If I try to goto the Network WiFi page I get a Gateway Error 502 No data returned. I get the same error if I goto Network Interfaces and try to edit an interface.</p><p>It looks like LuCI is trying to get some Network data and failing. Perhaps it&#039;s looking up Interfaces by the MAC address that was on the original UAP?? If so, there should be a config file I can fix??</p><p>Any ideas anyone, Thanks, Richard.</p>									</div>

					<p>After much testing of upgrade paths from the Ubiquiti firmware to OpenWrt, I have two different upgrade paths, one which leads to the error and one that ends with a working system.</p><p>If I load OpenWrt by using recovery mode (tftp) and then restore my backup of /overlay, it works fine.<br />If I use fwupdate from an ssh command line to load OpenWrt and then restore my backup of /overlay, I get the problem.</p>									</div>
