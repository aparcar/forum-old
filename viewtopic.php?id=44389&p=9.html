					<p>Hi all.</p><p>After a small detour via a broken bootloader, UART mode and installing the NOR U-Boot from this thread (Thanks a bunch!) I managed to <a href="http://lektiondestages.blogspot.de/2015/05/using-easybox-803a-arcadyan-arv752dpw22.html">install OpenWRT 14.07 BB onto my EasyBox 803A</a>. Now after restoring the configuration area and resetting the router configuration via LuCI, WiFi and LAN work fine.<br />Then I wanted to install USB support and ALSA. Most packages install ok, but some (e.g. kmod-fs-ext4, alsa-lib) give me segmentation faults.

					<p>Hello guys!<br />I&#039;m currently using speedtouch 780wl and I tought to buy this device(803 A) it is like 10€ <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /><br />Can some explain me what do i get with openwrt ? Can i use port to PVC mapping ? I&#039;m using it for IPTV (8*40 adsl) and 8*60 for iptv.<br />So if its possible please answer. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> And do you think it would be upgrade from speedtouch 780wl ? I have auto port mapping based on mac address etc.</p><p>Thank you,<br />Adnan</p>									</div>

Most of the functions work. danube-voip and asterisk might work for phone functions.<br />2.) I would not recomment to try to flash it with the recovery tool without making a backup of your original firmware and having some experience. But once you have flashed succesfully uboot with openwrt, you can close the device and update it without openening it.<br />3.) I am using it as daily router and a second device as repeater with a webcam. I had no problems with the stable release Barrier Breaker until now.<br />4.) Yes, nice and even a cheap hardware.</p><p>You should allow time for the first steps and you might build OpenWRT by your own later.</p>									</div>
