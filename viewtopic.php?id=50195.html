					<p>Version 1.6.1 is primarily a bugfix release. A fix for the recent <br />heartbleed<br /> openssl bug is included, along with several other non-security related fixes and improvements.</p><p>Only routers that were using the Tor or OpenVPN functionality in Gargoyle were vulnerable to the heartbleed bug. Anyone who is using either of these applications<br />is strongly advised to upgrade. </p><p>Also, functionality to clear out old OpenVPN keys and certificates has been introduced (disable OpenVPN, then click &quot;Clear All Existing OpenVPN keys&quot;).<br />It is strongly recommended that anyone running an OpenVPN server on a router that was potentially vulnerable to heartbleed, take advantage of this functionality<br />and regenerate all of their keys and certificates. The primary reason for the slight delay in this release from when heartbleed was first disclosed was<br />to implement this functionality. Since OpenVPN is one of only two vulnerable applications, it made sense to make sure the ability to clear old, vulnerable<br />keys was implemented along with the fix for the bug itself.</p><p>New in 1.6.1:<br />list of 8 items<br />• Fixes &quot;heartbleed&quot; bug in OpenSSL, OpenSSL upgraded to 1.0.1g which is not vulnerable<br />• Ability to clear old keys and certificates when OpenVPN is disabled implemented<br />• New option to explicitly block nonOpenVPN traffic in OpenVPN Client, preventing problems if OpenVPN connection dies<br />• Notice of OpenVPN status added to login page when OpenVPN client is active<br />• Fixes implementation of DMZ, should now work with port forwarding again<br />• Improved identification of default ping target for QoS ACC<br />• Tor version upgraded to latest stable 0.2.4.21<br />• Add German Translation (Thanks to Thomas Knepper)</p><p>More here <br /><a href="http://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=5560">http://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/vi … amp;t=5560</a> <br />Download here <br /><a href="http://www.gargoyle-router.com//wiki/doku.php">http://www.gargoyle-router.com//wiki/doku.php</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tapper</strong> on 2 May 2014, 10:51)</p>
