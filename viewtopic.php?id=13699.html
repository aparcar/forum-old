					<p>I have spent several days googling this topic; however, I could not find the answer.</p><p>My setup is:<br /> vlan1 static IP address 192.178.1.250/255.255.255.0<br /> br0 static IP address 172.17.0.1/255.255.255.0</p><p> DHCP server(192.168.1.1) &lt;-&gt;(192.168.1.250, vlan1)WRT(172.17.0.1, br0)&lt;-&gt;client</p><p>I used wireshark to monitor the traffic. I can see that &quot;DHCP discover&quot; is successfully relayed to the DHCP server with sport=68 and dport=67 from 192.168.1.250. The DHCP server sends &quot;DHCP offer&quot; back with sport=67 and dport=67 to 172.17.0.1. Therefore, I used DNAT at the DHCP server to change the destination address from 172.17.0.1 to 192.168.1.250.</p><p>My 1st trial for the dhcp-fwd setup, the &quot;if&quot; parameter of /etc/dhcp-fwd.conf:<br />&nbsp; if br0 false true true<br />&nbsp; if vlan1 true false true</p><p>In this case, the &quot;DHCP REPLY (offer)&quot; from the DHCP server goes to the INPUT chain of vlan1. Unfortunately, the /var/log/dhcp-fwd.log says &quot;Interface has no clients&quot;.</p><p>It seems the packet goes to the wrong interface. As a result, I added the following in the S35firewall script:<br /> iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i vlan1 -p udp -s 192.168.1.1 --sport 67 --dport 67 -j DNAT --to 172.17.0.1<br /> iptables -A FORWARD -i vlan1 -o br0 -udp -d 172.17.0.1</p><p>However, the above DNAT has no effect; the packet instead of going to the FORWARD chain, it still goes to the INPUT chain and is rejected by the &quot;port unreachable&quot; rule. I tried to see if DNAT works in general. I connected another PC with static IP address=172.17.0.2 to the br0 interface as depicted below:</p><p>DHCP server&lt;-&gt;(192.168.1.250,vlan1)WRT(172.17.0.1,br0)&lt;-&gt;(172.17.0.2)PC</p><p>I changed the DNAT to 172.17.0.2:67 instead of 172.17.0.1. I used wireshark at 172.17.0.2; I can see the packets &quot;DHCP reply&quot; go through the FORWARD chain and reach 172.17.0.2. This means the DNAT and FORWARD are working. So, could anyone give me a hand why I cannot forward port 67 from vlan1 to br0 and ingeneral how to set up dhcp-fwd properly. What did I do wrong?</p>									</div>
