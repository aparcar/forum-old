					<p>Dear All,</p><p>I have a ROM image from my speedtouch router, which you can access it from</p><p><a href="http://www.2shared.com/file/3049252/2758df7/image.html">http://www.2shared.com/file/3049252/2758df7/image.html</a></p><p>The image contains a few files (one big file that starts with OSI223... (offset 0x311A00) along with several small files). Although I was able to extract all the files by hand, I still don&#039;t know about the format of the File System that was used. It is not SquashFS, CramFS or JFFS2. Has anybody seen such a File System used somewhere ?</p><p>A few things that I&#039;ve found out:</p><p>Clusters are 512 bytes. The first 4 bytes are FF F6 FF FF (most of the time) and the rest (508 bytes) is data. Every 254 data-cluster is accompanied with a non-data cluster. The root directory table starts with 00 7E FF FF (I think). I didn&#039;t see any particular checksum for each cluster or for a group of them.</p><p>Thank you very much in advance and sorry if I&#039;m posting it in the wrong forum (in that case I appreciate if you kindly let me know the right forum to forward this question).</p><p>Cheers,</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi xaviour,</p><p>Thanks a lot for the link. Actually I know all about RSA signature and the problem with modifying the firmware (BTW, there is a simple solution to that, I can simply change the exponent in the RSA to 1 (using jtag) ).</p><p>My question wasn&#039;t about the possibility of running openwrt on the device, I just needed the format of the file system so that I can extract the files (the file that was attached to my previous email, had only a few files and it is very easy to extract them by hand, but I need an automatic way of doing this for more complex images).</p><p>Any more suggestions ?</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>									</div>
