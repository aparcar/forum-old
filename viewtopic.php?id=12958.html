					<p>I am very capable of installing linux on one of these devices and may do so IF I have the time but working 15 hour work days gives me no time to do much of anything else so might consider buying a pre installed wrt with linux on it and asterisk and a firewall if that is a safe bet to do all three. Anyone recommend who to puchace this unit from? I like ipcop as a firewall and has worked 100% reliable for well over a year.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have never heard of loading fedora (or any other GUI-based OS) on any kind of embedded hardware. Everything you listed can be done by openwrt, I&#039;m not sure who sells routers with it pre-installed though, I&#039;m sure if you send someone the hardware, and a few extra bucks, they would be willing to install and configure openwrt for you.</p>									</div>

					<p>haryv,</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I understand you work crazy hours and I am in the same boat as you. But here is the problem with what you want to do.&nbsp; If something breaks what are you going to do ? Even if you purchase a router with the firmware and options of your choice that is all you are going to get. He/she isn&#039;t going to give you technical support anytime something breaks (Unless you pay that person for his/her time).&nbsp; It will be a much better idea for you to do this yoruself and it will be fun.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just my 2 cents.</p>									</div>

					<p>Or get something commercial. You may have to pay more but you get support at anytime if you make the right arrangements...</p>									</div>
