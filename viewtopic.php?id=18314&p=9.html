					<p>Argh .. well this is getting annoying :\</p><p>I&#039;ve got a TEW-632 flashed with Kamikaze r14959 and I&#039;m trying to update the firmware.

					<p>I have a 632, I&#039;ve tried various firmwares listed on here. Currently I have <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-tew-632brp-squashfs.uni">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … uashfs.uni</a> and it works - mostly.</p><p>I have a problem with several packages that I want to use. ntpclient, wol, etherwake all give an error similar to: symbol &#039;stdout&#039;: can&#039;t handle reloc type 0x7e</p><p>I haven&#039;t been able to find any resolution to this. I&#039;m thinking I&#039;m going to have to try another image. But the question is which one?I tried the most recent bare bones from <br /><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/fratzicu/Home/firmware-files">https://sites.google.com/site/fratzicu/ … ware-files</a>, which worked - but then I couldn&#039;t update with opkg. After changing the config file, it complained that the packages weren&#039;t appropriate for this architecture.</p><p>I&#039;m just trying to get wireless, and wake on lan running with ssh - seems like it should be pretty straightforward .... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

After flashing my DIR-615 C1 with the snapshot image from Dec. 3, I installed both fastindex and admin-full (which requires a whole bunch of other dependency packages installed as well) but nothing helped and I still get &quot;not found&quot; when trying to access the web interface. Also tried other things like clearing the temp directory and so on, nothing helped.</p><p>I know that everything you can do with luci you can do with the CLI, but I am not familiar with the linux networking/routing config. Is there short guide somewhere... I think last time I used CLI on a router was about 10 years ago, and those were Ciscos.</p>									</div>
