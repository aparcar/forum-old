					<p>I set up my TP-Link TL-WR710N as a wireless hotspot with openvpn functionality. There is one issue, that I cannot solve though. When I want to connect the WR710 to a new wireless network as client the master wlan is not available and I have to use a wired lan connection. The master wlan only becomes available, when connected to a wlan as client. Is there a setting that makes the master wlan available even without being connected to a wireless wan?</p><p>I have to admit, I am not really familiar with openwrt and just followed this guide: <a href="https://www.digitalreplica.org/2014/10/pocket-internet-privacy-shield/">https://www.digitalreplica.org/2014/10/ â€¦ cy-shield/</a></p><p>Does anyone here have an idea?</p>									</div>

					<p>That&#039;s quite a well-written guide - good link to keep.</p><p>To the best of my knowledge: no, this is seemingly how it works in OpenWRT.&nbsp; I have a vague recollection of someone explaining once that this has something to do with the way the Atheros drivers used by OpenWRT work, but I can&#039;t back that up with any facts.&nbsp; If you want to research more it&#039;s got something to do with simultaneous client (STA) and access point (AP) mode setups depending on the STA connection being up.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your quick reply, atom. I read some more like you recommended and it seems there is no solution to this. What a shame, solving this would make my device perfect ...</p>									</div>

					<p>That router only has one radio in it. When the client portion is searching for the network its supposed to join it cannot also act as an access point. There&#039;s no solution to this.</p>									</div>

					<p>I guess the only workaround is to disable the client network. When I do that I can logon to the master wlan. Is there a way to automatically disable all client wlans during start up with some kind of script?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>marcel.esser</strong> on 28 Nov 2015, 00:41)</p>

					<p>It should be possible to use a WLAN USB Stick to connect to the public hotspots and the internal WLAN for your private access point. You need to install the kernel modules and firmware for the WLAN USB Stick.</p>									</div>

					<p>a solution would be to create a script that checks if any &quot;master&quot; network is present, if so, connect to it and create a network you want to connect your clients to.&nbsp; If no &quot;master&quot; network is present, create a &quot;setup network&quot; on which you can connect and setup the device to connect to a &quot;master&quot; network..</p><br /><p>edit: ok i mixed the naming of the 2 networks, but i hope you get where i wanted to go...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>yoyellow</strong> on 13 Dec 2015, 15:46)</p>
