					<p>What Linksys seems to be doing, don’t totally know yet, I tried to flash dd-wrt on router and I had registered with Linksys. It wouldn’t flash but it let me reset back to ome.. I went back to linksyssmartwifi screen, No place to manual load or choose file under connectivity. Called and the more or less told me not to worry there were updates available. I told her that I was thinking about loading did-wrt in the future she said they didn’t support it. I told her that on the box they said that it was OpenWrt and dd-wrt ready. She more or less told me she couldn’t do anything. Has anyone else had this problem with Linksys?</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t have this problem with my Linksys WRT3200ACM. How it should work:<br />1. Log into your router (default ip is 192.168.1.1)<br />2. Go to Connectivity<br />3. In the section &quot;Firmware Update&quot; select &quot;Choose File&quot;<br />4. Select the LEDE factory file and update</p><p><a href="https://www.linksys.com/de/support-article/?articleNum=138220">Here</a> is a link with pictures (in German but you get the idea).</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes that is correct, but it was no longer on the screen to do that. Resetting didn’t bring it back up.</p>									</div>

					<p>Magic Simon great tutorial, but they will no longer make the manual choose file available. I think it all had to do with my trying to flash dd-wrt and the failure.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have reset and entered both ways but the screen will still not display the manual choose file option or even the local option, thinking back she asked if I had tried to load did-wrt. It makes me think this thing is getting snake oily.</p>									</div>

					<p>the 3200 is a very powerful router, it would be a shame to abandon it not to mention to loose the $$$ you spent.</p><p>That being said, the r8000 is a comparable router and very solid.</p>									</div>
