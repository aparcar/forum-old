					<p>Folks,</p><p>Having some problems with a console cable built from a DKU-5.. My RX works fine and can see the WGT634U rebooting every 5 seconds, but I can&#039;t seem to get decent output from the TX strand. Connecting the two together gives some pretty whacky output on my console screen, although I do occasionally get the correct characters echo&#039;d back to me after a bit of fiddling.</p><p>Does anyone have any tips to overcome this? I&#039;ve tried stripping back some of the insulation around the RX flex in case the wire was a bit dirty, but it&#039;s not made any difference.</p><p>Any tips/hints much appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>Connecting the RX and TX is a loopback test.</p><p>You might get a few stray characters when you first connect them, but once connected it should cleanly echo back whatever is sent. If you still get garbage check the connections you may have a short in the cable itself.</p><p>(if you&#039;re not using a pl2303 then you&#039;ll need to hook up vcc and gnd before the loopback test will work)</p>									</div>
