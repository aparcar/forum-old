					<p>Hello, I am looking for a cheap router with good OpenWRT support and some specific features.</p><p>1. Good range: external antenna, 100mW min (the more output power, the better)<br />2. 11n (150mb min)<br />3. Wifi chipset well supported under linux (NOT broadcom), I only tried ralink and atheros USB adapters and ralink was working great, not atheros. I dont know if support of integrated wifi chipset is different.<br />4. USB port, 2.0 min.<br />5. Easy OpenWRT intallation: firmware upload through HTTP, NOT flashing</p><p>I found two routers which meet the requirements: MR3240 ($50), MR3220 ($40), but I wondered if I could find cheaper ones, maybe chinese.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Save yourself a lot of trouble and just buy one of the TP-Link routers that are well supported and available from many online shops. If you&#039;re looking to go for the cheapest, the WR842ND is a good choice, as noted by metai. Goes for about $30 online. I have seen the WD My Net N600/N750 on ebay for the $30-50, but the cheaper range is for a used one.</p>									</div>

					<p>The trick is working backwards from the supported list to find not just the cheapest one but the one that makes the most sense if you&#039;re willing to pay somewhat more (not the most) to future-proof yourself. Things like Gigabit ports, a better CPU, more RAM, more flash. That&#039;s more difficult considering how many models there are.</p>									</div>

					<p>That does look awfully good, but it being N vs AC hurts. When there&#039;s already talk of AD perhaps for next year, it would be tough going for something that&#039;s not AC.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;d go for a TP-Link 1043. It&#039;s cheap and very well supported. Here in germany you can get it for 40€ from Amazon.</p><p>If you want it much cheaper, you could try the TP-Link WR842ND, WR841ND or WR841N. The difference beween WR841N and WR841ND is the detachable antenna of the ND version, which makes 6€ difference (18€ for 841N, 25€ for the 841ND). So if you never plan for changing the antenna, the N version is as good as the ND version but 30% cheaper.</p><p>I would not expect any AC capable device to reach that low price levels any time soon. The high throughput devices usually come with more memory as well as more powerfull CPUs. I guess those are required to handle a huge amount of concurrent connections. But this leads to more expensiv devices, unfortunately.</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>golialive</strong> on 27 Oct 2014, 01:37)</p>

					<p>If you want 802.11ac, the TP-Link Archer C7 is the best supported by far in openwrt, although even that isn&#039;t perfect yet. I&#039;d personally go with 802.11n unless you already have a good need for it. When 802.11ac support is rock solid, the prices will be significantly lower. My guess is that your total price for 802.11n now plus 802.11ac later will be the same as just buying 802.11ac today.</p>									</div>
