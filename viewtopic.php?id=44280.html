					<p>Hello,<br />I have to do a job for a captive portal on a campingplace and like to do ist with OpenWrt.<br />I have a test scenario with 3 TP-Link TL-WDR4300. They have 2 radio (2,4 GHz and 5 GHz), one WAN and 4 LAN.<br />The 2,4 GHz radios should work as APs and the 5 GHz should do the connections between the 3 systems via Ad hoc or 802.11s.<br />Cause the portal system has to work as DHCP server and not a OpenWrt, I have bridged LAN, WAN and the AP-net and disabled all DHCP services. On the router, connected to the portal, clients get IP from portal and everything looks good.<br />But not from Routers connected via Ad hoc. I can ping from router &lt;-&gt; router.<br />In simple words: Clients connected to APs without direct WAN get no IP.<br />I have tried with mode 802.11s without any access. The documetation from Thomas Wagner can&#039;t help me.</p><p>You can see the described network under <a href="http://www.hotspot-portal.de/schema.pdf">http://www.hotspot-portal.de/schema.pdf</a> </p><p>It would be very nice, if someone could help me with a step-by-step documetation. If neccesary, I would pay for it. It is urgent.<br />I think, my main problem is, to route traffic from the other APs over the AdHoc connections to the AP with WAN connection.</p><p>Thx</p>									</div>
