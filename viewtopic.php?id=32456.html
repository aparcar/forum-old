					<p>hello,<br />so i bought this Sweex LW160 in a local store seeing written on its box AR7240 and AR9285.<br />home i managed to get on its 192.168.16.1 web ui with user sweex and mysweex password, unfortunately i cant upgrade a tp-link wr740 firmware since it says :</p><p>Error code: 18005<br />Upgrade unsuccessfully because the version of the upgraded file was incorrect. Please check the file name.</p><p>so, i cracked it open and it seems a bit newer board than my tp-link wr740n (v2.4) , i would appreciate if you guys can point me to the serial rx, tx and gnd so i can stick some wires and check its boot loader tomorrow.</p><p>here&#039;s the BIG and a bit sharpened picture of the board:</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www.ip6.ro/Sweex_LW160.jpg" alt="http://www.ip6.ro/Sweex_LW160.jpg" /></span></p><p>or click right here: <a href="http://www.ip6.ro/Sweex_LW160.jpg">http://www.ip6.ro/Sweex_LW160.jpg</a></p><p>thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>aind</strong> on 18 Oct 2011, 02:41)</p>
