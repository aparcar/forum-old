					<p>Hello world!</p><p>Searching the forum for &quot;mkfontdir&quot; doesn&#039;t yield any results so I suppose nobody has noticed this yet.</p><p>Building fonts or Xorg may lead to problems. For building fonts the tools mkfontdir and mkfontscale are required; not for the target-arch, the host building openwrt needs them. If these tools are not installed, openwrt does not provide them. Usually these tools come as a dependency of the Xserver. No Xserver, no tools, complaining openwrt.</p><p>Since openwrt usually doesn&#039;t come with Xorg a the tools are required only for building this propably doesn&#039;t qualify as a bug, but maybe this post helps other people.</p><p>Cheers</p>									</div>

					<p>This is a known issue. We&#039;d be happy to receive patches to let the build system build these required utilities as well.</p>									</div>
