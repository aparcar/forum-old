					<p>Hi!<br />I&#039;m new in this forum and I bought a TP-Link WR941HP router that&#039;s not being supported.<br />So my question is, is my router capable of running openwrt?</p><br /><p>Here is the hardware info that I found, there is also a GPL download link on the tplink site, which I can&#039;t post here because I don&#039;t have enough posts or something.</p><p>CPU1: Qualcomm Atheros TP9343 (750 MHz)<br />FLA1: 8 MiB (GigaDevice GD25Q64CSIG)<br />RAM1: 64 MiB (ESMT M14D5121632A-2.5B)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>emineminero</strong> on 15 Mar 2017, 21:17)</p>

					<p>Looks like a routine ath9k box.&nbsp; If you have serial access you could try flashing images for similar models.&nbsp; Check if the 941ND is the same CPU.&nbsp; Maybe the HP just has RF amplifiers and larger memory. </p><p>Flashing through the bootloader avoids the model version check that the factory GUI does-- you would put a sysupgrade directly to flash then try to boot it.&nbsp; TP Link builds should automatically probe the flash size.</p><p>If you build yourself an initrd image you can test it in RAM without touching the flash at all.&nbsp; &nbsp;Once you have OpenWrt running (from RAM), use it to flash.&nbsp; This is safer than cp.b in the bootloader where one wrong move can wipe the bootloader or the ART and leave the router severely bricked.</p><p>I see Amazon USA selling a WR-841HP but not the 941.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 16 Mar 2017, 02:14)</p>
