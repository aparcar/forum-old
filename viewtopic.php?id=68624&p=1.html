					<p>To celebrate the launch of the WRT3200ACM, Linksys is offering 54 units to the OpenWrt Developer Community in thanks for the support of the WRT line. In order to be considered, please post a few lines about yourself, and the OpenWrt project you’d like to start using the WRT3200ACM. On December 1st Linksys will make the selection of the 54 developers, and will get units out in time for the Holidays.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am passionate about open source software and Linux, being a community member of several open source projects. I am also a networking passionate/hobbyist for more than 10 years, spending a lot of time around computers and internet cafes when the internet was a rare and expensive thing in my city.</p><p>My story with the Linksys WRT series has begun in 2006 when I bought my real first router (WRT54GL). Before that, I was using an old Pentium 133 Mhz PC as a router. After several years of searching for some nice hardware to install OpenWRT, Linksys announced the new WRT line at CES. I was very happy.</p><p>I bought my first AC1900 V1 in summer 2015, and with the help of the community, especially from nitroshift, I obtained invaluable help to flash CC on it. Since then, I&#039;ve learned a lot about OpenWRT, how to customize it. I&#039;ve become also an IRC channel regular.</p><p>Since then, my mother&#039;s router is running OpenWRT too, and I have started building custom images for my router, but also playing and compiling images on x86 arch which can be easily tested in a VM, since I am mostly interested in contributing to LuCI. I have also reported several bugs.</p><p>I am very excited about the announcement of WRT3200ACM and I would be eager to play with it by helping test and stabilize the&nbsp; wireless driver on different builds and by improving LuCI.</p><p>Sorin B.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sorinello</strong> on 28 Nov 2016, 09:15)</p>

					<p>I started to use OpenWrt many years ago, but then my isp forced another router on me. Finally, I decided to being sick of a router a can&#039;t control, I picked up a WRT1900ACS to manage all my local network and connect to the isp router on the wan port. Works like a charm. In the future, I will continue to test the lasted LEDE on it, so a even newer Linksys model would be awesome.</p><p>Bonus for Linksys if I get picked: My kids would draw you a fairy riding on a unicorn pursuing a linksys router!</p>									</div>
