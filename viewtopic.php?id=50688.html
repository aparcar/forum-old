					<p>I made a page using CBI to change the config.<br />I hide the &quot;Save&quot; &quot;Save &amp; apply&quot; buttons, and add a new button, because I would like have a specific name for the button.<br />But when I want to refresh the page after press the button, I use luci.http.redirect() to the same page. It does not refresh the page, and the reason looks like it is a POST request, and LuCI responses nothing for it. <br />I want to know how to refresh the same page after changing the config. I&#039;ve tried several days to look for the correct way.<br />Thank you.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stone8936</strong> on 19 May 2014, 11:31)</p>
