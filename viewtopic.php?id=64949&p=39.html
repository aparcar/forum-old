This is why on WDR3500/4300 I switched to using the &quot;tpt&quot; trigger, which I really like...</p><p>I don&#039;t get the point why you are not using the WiFi leds? Can you please elaborate? Are you saying they behave differently to the other leds? I thought the trigger is what matters for the &quot;behavior&quot; of an led -- and you can apply it to arbitrary leds, which will then behave identically?</p></blockquote></div><p>Sorry, took a break from everything WRT related since my wrt1200ac has been rock solid on @david&#039;s r2695 build. </p><p>Yes, that&#039;s exactly what I&#039;m saying. The WiFi LEDs behave differently than do all other LEDs (instead of blinking different speeds depending on bandwidth, they are either solid if there is absolutely zero bandwidth for a period of 2-3 seconds, or blink/strobe so insanely fast that they almost look solid if there is any activity at all). </p><p>The LAN LEDs blink at different speeds, as you would expect them to, by default and therefore need no configuration in LEDE or entry in Luci. LEDE has the internet LED set to blink based on WAN activity (on stock Linksys image, it is solid always) and also blinks at different speeds. You&#039;ll see an entry for it in Luci. </p><p>There seems to be no way to modify the stock behavior of the WiFi LEDs, so I did what I described in my previous post to assign WiFi activity to the WPS LED so that it blinks at different speeds.&nbsp; But you could choose any other LED (for example the SATA led if you don&#039;t have anything connected via SATA) to display WiFi activity. </p><p>One point of note, you don&#039;t have to add entries/configure the default behavior of the LEDs (the exception being USB and SATA). You just add entries for what you want added or changed from the default settings.</p>									</div>
