					<p>I just got a WRT54G v8 which I mostly need to use as an ethernet/wireless bridge.<br />The built-in firmware does not seem to offer this functionality.&nbsp; Since I use OpenWT on my other boxes, I thought I&#039;d look for an OpenWRT firmware for these boxes, but I saw they don&#039;t seem to be supported.&nbsp; Luckily DD-WRT is available in &quot;micro&quot;-form, so I&#039;m using this for now, but I prefer OpenWRT&#039;s command-line interface and general flexibility.<br />So?&nbsp; Any news?</p>									</div>

					<p>I guess the biggest thing missed by those who want to run OpenWRT is to research what it supports before buying hardware.&nbsp; </p><p>The developers have made their stance pretty clear, that 2 mb flash units are not going to be supported.&nbsp; There are too many 4 mb and greater options out there to be concerned about maintaining a crippled version for the 2 mb junk routers on the market.&nbsp; </p><p>For less money than a new WRT54G goes for, there are several routers out there that use better Broadcom chip sets with more flash.</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenWrt does NOT support and will never support these crappy devices e.g. WRT54G &gt;= v5 and WRT54GS &gt;= v5.</p><p>Go ahead and load DD-WRT they support crappy hardware and don&#039;t ask here again for supporting these routers.</p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>forum2006</strong> on 29 Nov 2007, 17:34)</p>

					<p>if you must use openwrt there are a few options, </p><p>1. you can add an MMC card to hold your packages, then build a custom firmware that only has the minimum required to boot the device, then install everything else as ipk packages on the MMC/SD card.</p><p>2. install dd-wrt</p><p>again, the official stance for openwrt is that devices with 2mb of flash are not supported in any form, so you&#039;re on your own with these.</p>									</div>

					<p>The problem is not only the 2MB flash. Also the lack of RAM is a problem...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>forum2006</strong> on 29 Nov 2007, 17:49)</p>
