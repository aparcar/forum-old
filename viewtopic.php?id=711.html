Restarting syslog in circular mode would delete the log stored previously.</p><p>Why not just move the startup script down manually in &quot;special cases&quot; as you need to do with lots of other scripts?</p>									</div>

					<p>Two reasons.&nbsp; One is purely selfish <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>1) Because i every little bit of space counts.&nbsp; If it can be done a certain way in /rom, then i would love to see it rather than use precious jffs space.</p><p>2) If the unit doesn&#039;t boot, you&#039;re not going to be able to get onto it to check its syslog anyway.&nbsp; by starting syslog when i do (and with the remote options) i acutally get a log of whats going on during boot before i can even log on (the only thing that starts before it is networking, and if that doesn&#039;t come up you&#039;re hosed anyway).</p><p>If the boot fails before dropbear starts, or have problems logging onto the box, at least i have a chance to know what went wrong.</p>									</div>
