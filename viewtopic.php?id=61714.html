					<p>Hi all, I&#039;m asking some advice on the ZBT WG2626 router board if someone has already tried those nasty things I&#039;ve in mind.</p><p>Looking at the specs it seems to me that the pci espress slot is multiplexed with the sata chip but has someone tried to install a second pci-e sata card ?</p><p>I would like to use this router also as a little NAS/DLNA Station with more disks connected to it especially because on aliexpress there is a variant (maybe an early revision) with 2 sata ports so with another sata card (there are many based on the same ASM1061 chipset already mounted) it could reach 4 ports.</p><p>For reference this is the board I&#039;m looking for:</p><p><a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/item/MT7621-OpenWrt-Wireless-Router-1200Mbps-dual-band-802-11AC-Router-built-in-PCI-E-Slot-Support/32472992006.html?ws_ab_test=searchweb201556_1,searchweb201644_2_79_78_77_82_80_62,searchweb201560_8">http://www.aliexpress.com/item/MT7621-O â€¦ eb201560_8</a></p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

On WG2626 two of them are taken by Wi-Fi chips and last one by ASM1061 (pci-e to SATA bridge). I don&#039;t expect that one pci-e bus is multiplexed between SATA bridge and mpci-e connector.</p>									</div>
