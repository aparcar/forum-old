					<p>Hi!</p><p>I have just voided my warranty of my new router :) .. to swap the broadcom wifi mini-pci with a Intel ipw2100 mini-pci. I flashed the router with the kamikaze 2.6 image and installed the driver package for the ipw2100.</p><p>The problem is now, that when loading the driver, the firmware is not found. dmesg says:<br />ipw2100: Detected Intel PRO/Wireless 2100 Network Connection<br />ipw2100: eth2: Firmware &#039;ipw2100-1.3.fw&#039; not available or load failed.<br />ipw2100: eth2: ipw2100_get_firmware failed: -2<br />ipw2100: eth2: Failed to power on the adapter.<br />ipw2100: eth2: Failed to start the firmware.</p><p>I have copied the firmware files to /lib/firmware/2.6.19.2 but this didn&#039;t help. So where do I have to put the firmware files, so that they get loaded automatically?</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>									</div>

					<p>I just investigated the kernel config from <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/tags/kamikaze_7.06/target/linux/brcm47xx-2.6/config/default">https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/tags/ka â€¦ ig/default</a> and apparently neither the CONFIG_IPW2100_LEGACY_LOAD or the CONFIG_FW_LOADER option is not set (according to the ipw2100 faq, this is needed to load the firmware).</p><p>So does this mean, that I have to recompile the kernel with one of those options set?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I can confirm this problem, and just add that other firmwares I put in /lib/firmware can be loaded but not this one. Also a weird thing is the correct filename of the firmware, you have to rename it to change the downloaded original filename.</p><p>Regards</p>									</div>

					<p>So as I understand you correctly, you renamed the firmware file and the firmware got loaded then? What name did you rename the firmware file to?<br />I just tried to put the newly downloaded firmware files under /lib/firmware, but got the same error, that the firmware ipw2100-1.3.fw was not found.</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>									</div>

					<p>No, sorry for the misunderstanding. <br />I meant you have to rename the file but even doing that the file is not found. Other devices&#039; firmwares ARE found</p>									</div>
