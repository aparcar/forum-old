					<p>Hi Guys,<br />i have noticed that the most common way of accessing ntfs is via ntfs-3g. Is there a possibility to use ufsd instead? The reason is that the write speed is twice as fast with it and is not that heavy on the cpu too. I tried searching trough the forums but it does not seem to be mentioned a lot. Is there any other option to mount ntfs drives with fast write speeds? On WRT1900ACS i get only 60mb/s write speed with ntfs-3g and over 100mb/s with the stock firmware.</p><p>Bw,<br />Peter</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pepsinio</strong> on 3 Jan 2016, 12:15)</p>

					<p>I managed to find a .ko module and .ipkg for arm as well. There is no source code. Only .obj files in the installation. I will be able to test it next week.<br />In the License states the following &quot; Unless determined otherwise, Paragon grants the softwareâ€™s end user the simple right to install the software on a device and use it for an unlimited period of time. &quot;. My assumption is, if it is possible to be installed at least we can provide it as an option in the how-to of openwrt for writable ntfs (<a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/writable_ntfs">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/writable_ntfs</a>) with detailed information how to be installed, since it does not break this agreement and gives better throughput than ntfs-3g.</p><p>In theory it should work with newer kernel i guess.<br />@zloop i don&#039;t think ntfs-3g can be easily improoved. If it was possible, for so many years somebody probably would have done it. </p><p>Bw,<br />Peter</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pepsinio</strong> on 3 Jan 2016, 20:13)</p>
