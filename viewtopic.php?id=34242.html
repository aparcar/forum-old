					<p>I was wondering if there was anyone out there who could direct me in the direction of where the info is if someone has already tried this. I&#039;ve done multiple google searches and came back empty handed. I see the wifirobot but that was about it. I have an old WRT54G v4 and know it has the 2 serial ports. While playing around with Kamikaze, I noticed that it has packages for setserial and uucp, which is what I use on my normal linux box to console into my other device. What I would like to do is use uucp to and connect both my linux box and other device to the serial ports and use the router as a console server, as sadly I keep getting BSOD for windows when there is an error and I figured SSH to the router and have the router handle the connections thus eliminating my issues, then I can also manage them remotely and see everything going on. </p><p>My questions are,<br />1) Is this possible?<br />2) Has it ever been done?<br />3) Where can I find info on this?</p><p>Thanks,<br />G.</p>									</div>

					<p>So I&#039;ve been reading up on this, and it looks like a cake walk to setup, my only other concern now is, do I have to use a Serial To TTL connection for the PC? I am assuming yes, and for the other device that uses TTL as it is, that one, I won&#039;t need it. Also, would the RX and TX connections be reverses for it to work properly? So RX from Host to TX on Router and repeat for TX on the host?</p><p>Thanks,<br />-G.</p>									</div>
