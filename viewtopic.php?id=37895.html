					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I recently buyed a Linksys WRT160NL and flashed OpenWRT 10.03.1 on it. I&#039;m used to Linux, so I&#039;m very pleased with what it offers. However, the purpose of this router is to provide a hotspot in a Hotel&#039;s common areas. </p><p>My basic idea is the following:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ipv4 internet
      |
      |
 DSL gateway ------------- Hotel Server (DMZ)
192.168.1.1/24   |          192.168.1.2/24
                 |
                 |
           192.168.1.3/24
            WRT160NL router
           10.0.0.1/16 (wlan0)
                 |
                 |
              customer
(anywhere between 10.0.0.2 and 10.0.255.254)</code></pre></div><p>This is essentialy very easy to setup, but here comes the tricky thing: </p><p>When the customer authenticates with the WiFi Hotspot in WRT160NL, I want it to show him a login screen where he will have to introduce his room number and his checkout date. The router shall verify these data with the hotel server, wich runs MySQL, and if they are correct the WRT should provide a limited bandwith to this client until his checkout date at 11:30 AM.</p><p>Is this possible?</p><p>Thanks for your time, and sorry for my english level. If there&#039;s anything I didn&#039;t express clearly please tell me and I&#039;ll try with other words.</p>									</div>

					<p>if you&#039;re used to linux then this is a good stating point <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/wireless.hotspot">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/wireless.hotspot</a></p><p>and to answer your question, YES, it is possible but you have to decide which solution is better for your needs and ask here some specific question related to configuring stuff.<br />I believe it&#039;s very unlikely that a forum user already has a similar setup in place.<br />from what I know you have to pay good money for an integrator to set up something like this.</p><p>Good luck!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>maurer</strong> on 5 Jul 2012, 17:16)</p>
