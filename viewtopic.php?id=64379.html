					<p>I know this discussion, but DIR-300 A revision is not DIR-300S A, they are completely different.<br />DIR-300 A is the oldest one DLINK router and based on Atheros and DIR-300S A is based on Realtek.<br />DIR-300S was announced several months ago and it&#039;s completely new.</p><p>So, DIR-300 A and DIR-300S are not the same, different routers, that are not compatible with each other.</p><p>Could someone from developers at OpenWrt make clear regarding DIR-300S support?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mtatarin</strong> on 23 Apr 2016, 02:19)</p>
