					<p>Hi there,<br />I bought an <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-mr3420">TL-MR3220</a>, which has a <strong>5dbi antenna</strong> 802.11n router and I placed it to same location that <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dsl-2640u">D-Link2640U(B)</a> modem (802.11g - Broadcom) works before...</p><p>Firstly I detect signal power drop comparing to DLink 2640U. (Might be up to ~ 4-5 dbm)... I cannot surf from my bed with TL-MR3220 also but I could make it using D-Link2640U before. How could it be since this modal has big, 5dbi antenna?</p><p>Also I have another ADSL modem, Inca 204W ADSL (802.11g - TNET1350A ) router modem, (has a small antenna also) looks has better signal and coverage than TL-MR3220.<br />I can surf with my phone near of TL-MR3220 by connecting to Inca 204W ADSL router, but<br />I cannot surf with my phone near of Inca 204W ADSL if I connected to TL-MR3220...<br />(routers using different channels offcourse)</p><p>Is that means, ADSL routers has better signal than TL-MR3220 ?</p><p>I installed OpenWRT before testing those, don&#039;t know/think if anything differ if I using original firmware....11n router and I placed it to same location that [url=http://wiki.open</p><p>I also turn TL-MR3220 to 802.11g only. It helps little for surfing but signal levels are lower than 2640U again...<br />Does it related with 802.11n vs 802.11g chipsets?</p><p>I expect that TL-MR3220 has much more better range due big antenna and newer chipset. But It looks worse than my old adsl routers...<br />Or my TL-MR3220 is defected?<br />Or atheros chipsets are generally has similar problems?<br /><strong>Any comment is welcome.</strong></p><p>Now I put my ADSL router top of the MR3220 and Inca 204w ADSL router It has 3db higher signal!<br />Any one could explain this???</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>EUA</strong> on 13 Jun 2012, 01:09)</p>
