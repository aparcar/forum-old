					<p>Hi, I think I have bricked my device, but I would really like some help by anyone with some ideas, since I don&#039;t have the means to do a Serial Recovery (nowhere to buy the cables). I&#039;ll explain what I did, and hope someone comes up with an idea.</p><p>I installed OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment on my TP-Link WR941NDv5.1, and was trying to install DD-WRT to try it out. The instructions I found said to copy the <em><strong>bin</strong></em> as <em><strong>trx</strong></em> to the router and do a <em><strong>mtd write flash.trx linux</strong></em>.</p><p>Instead I did the following:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> 
  $ scp flash.bin 192.168.1.1:/tmp/flash.trx
  $ ssh root@192.168.1.1
  root@OpenWrt:~# cd /tmp/
  root@OpenWrt:/tmp# ls
  TZ                flash.trx         luci-indexcache   overlay           run
  dhcp.leases       lock              luci-modulecache  resolv.conf       state
  etc               log               luci-sessions     resolv.conf.auto  sysinfo
  root@OpenWrt:/tmp# cat /proc/mtd
  dev:    size   erasesize  name

  root@OpenWrt:/tmp# reboot

					<p>ok, that page is about &quot;linksys WRT54GS version 2&quot;, i guess it&#039;s not the same for every router ^^</p><p>the file you used is named &quot;webflash&quot;, that means it MUST be used from WEB GUI, not with mtd (specifically, from DD-WRT WEB GUI <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />).</p><p>if you are lucky we can recover it with the tftp procedure.</p><p>following <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=38953">this,</a> were you able to see the tftp request with wireshark?</p>									</div>

					<p>I can see the `Who has XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX?

					<p>I think the problem is that those `Who has...` messages where from <strong>my computer</strong> asking in the network. So I guess I don&#039;t see the router&#039;s `Who has...` messages.</p><p>When the Ethernet cable is connected, my computer self-assigns the 169.254.35.26 IP and sends `Who has 169.254.35.26? Tell 0.0.0.0`. It also sends `Who has 17.151.16.23? Tell 169.254.35.26`.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>chamini2</strong> on 1 Feb 2015, 22:24)</p>

					<p>that is strange, if you see the WPS led on when powering with reset button pressed, you should see the arp requests from router in wireshark.</p><p>can you try on a different pc?</p>									</div>

					<p>I tried from another computer and nothing was listed. On the first one I did see some ARP requests, but I don&#039;t think they were from the router either.</p><p>When I home I&#039;ll do it again in the first computer and check &quot;who&quot; was sending those requests. In the meantime, do you have any other idea?</p><p>Thank you for your help!</p>									</div>
