					<p>Hello all,</p><p>Decided to add sdhc card to my trusty dockstar, but cannot get it working. Dockstar runs attitude_adjustment, installed kmod-mmc and kmod-mmc-spi, but no any message in dmesg that I would even have card attached, not even an error.<br />Used this <a href="http://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=258">http://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic â€¦ &amp;t=258</a> for attaching sd card. Hardware seems to be ok, measured resistors, lines seems not to be connected directly to GND or VCC.<br />May be someone has it working and can point which modules should be loaded and may be something else to be done?</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>

					<p>Dockstar has SDHC module. mmc over GPIO works fine for my WRT54G for sure and I&#039;m using it, but not here. I tried mmc-over-gpio, it did not worked for me (though gives errors) and also it does not have four bit mode - per SD card attachment circuit seems four bit mode is utilised.<br />Any other ideas?</p>									</div>
