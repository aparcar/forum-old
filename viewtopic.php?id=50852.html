					<p>Hi everybody,</p><p>I know that a lot of people still have this buggy modem. That is why I have decided to compile a new firmware for it instead of leaving it in a cupboard. I have compiled 4 versions for the WAG160N v1. Version 1 is the most complete and the free space should be enough for most people (the free space is used mainly for configuration files).</p><p><strong>/!\ There is no DSL support, this firmware will convert you WAG160N v1 into a Ethernet/Wifi router /!\</strong></p><p>It is possible to go back to official firmware with DSL support very easily. If you need to go back to the official firmware, simply flash WAG160Nv1-EU-ANNEXA-ETSI-1.00.16-code-openwrt-flashable through OpenWrt (<a href="https://mega.co.nz/#!icNGRIia!ncxj6kscwCr3jN7D9-VDR7dOqJw8ti34_UJuMmZo1hs">https://mega.co.nz/#!icNGRIia!ncxj6kscw … UJuMmZo1hs</a>).</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://s13.postimg.org/eqxwwsv7r/image.png" alt="http://s13.postimg.org/eqxwwsv7r/image.png" /></span></p><p><strong>Version 1 (around 168kB free):</strong><br />OpenWrt Barrier Breaker r40862<br />Web Interface : Luci r10249<br />QoS, UPnP, Dynamic DNS, Custom Commands, Wake On Lan<br />OpenVPN 2.3.2 PolarSSL<br />Updated ath9k Wifi drivers (more stable)</p><p><a href="https://mega.co.nz/#!mZkxAaIZ!s6LAQsXJI04JNSAimymK8q0cVf0GGs2r-uKMTFhEhpw">https://mega.co.nz/#!mZkxAaIZ!s6LAQsXJI … uKMTFhEhpw</a></p><p><strong>Version 2 (around 168kB free):</strong><br />OpenWrt Barrier Breaker r40862<br />Web Interface : No UI (only SSH/Telnet)<br />OpenVPN 2.3.2 OpenSSL (with openvpn-easy-rsa)<br />Updated ath9k Wifi drivers (more stable)</p><p><a href="https://mega.co.nz/#!uMcCmLSD!0z7ZwVSpoB2OmKnBcsnT40YR5EiGvQWIcVa2YErGJCc">https://mega.co.nz/#!uMcCmLSD!0z7ZwVSpo … Va2YErGJCc</a></p><p><strong>Version 3 (around 360kB free):</strong><br />OpenWrt Barrier Breaker r40862<br />Web Interface : Luci r10249<br />QoS, UPnP, Dynamic DNS, Custom Commands, Wake On Lan<br />No OpenVPN<br />Updated ath9k Wifi drivers (more stable)</p><p><a href="https://mega.co.nz/#!TA8UwCLL!AzSbuVE7WpjX6PMf95Bmhuk-Wa5ViaIUmphzx6kuLBw">https://mega.co.nz/#!TA8UwCLL!AzSbuVE7W … phzx6kuLBw</a></p><p><strong>Version 3 bis - unstripped libraries &amp; kept opkg data (around 296kB free):</strong><br />OpenWrt Barrier Breaker r40862<br />Web Interface : Luci r10249<br />QoS, UPnP, Dynamic DNS, Custom Commands, Wake On Lan<br />No OpenVPN<br />Updated ath9k Wifi drivers (more stable)</p><p><a href="https://mega.co.nz/#!7VNFiRpK!wRHBT6saIl2Ye4FlSqwdlX6iNesENlNO51MWtXlxYQc">https://mega.co.nz/#!7VNFiRpK!wRHBT6saI … 1MWtXlxYQc</a></p><p><strong>Instructions :</strong><br />To flash the router you need :<br />- A screwdriver<br />- A little wire or a stapple<br />- Nothing else <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Most people were using a LVTTL cable however, it requires you to buy an adapter, to solder, ... it takes time. I realised that to stop the boot we can actually press ANY key, in fact that mean that if we generate any signal on the serial input, the boot stop.<br />First you have to open the modem by removing the 4 screws and the plastic top. There are some clips on the side, but even if you break these clips the top will still fit perfectly with the screws.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://s13.postimg.org/4jfdke8zr/image.png" alt="http://s13.postimg.org/4jfdke8zr/image.png" /></span></p><p>When you power the modem, you have only 1s to activate the Recovery Mode. The trick is to rub a stapple or a wire between the pin 4 (in red) and the pin 1 (in orange) while booting. Do not solder&nbsp; anything, the goal is not to generate a clean signal but to generate noise ! <br />The easiest way is to hold the stapple between&nbsp; pin 1 and 4 (do not shortcut pin 1 and 3) and to rub it slightly when it boots. It should activate the recovery mode almost everytime. If it doesn&#039;t work you can also rub the stapple between pin 4 (in red) and pin 3 (+3.3V, next to pin 4).<br />If you succeed, the power LED goes off and the Ethernet LED should be blinking. If the power LED is still on 5s after you plugged the router, it failed. Just unplug the modem and try again. If the ethernet light is off verify you plugged the ethernet cable properly <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://s13.postimg.org/3v6j1ga9z/image.png" alt="http://s13.postimg.org/3v6j1ga9z/image.png" /></span></p><p>Now you should be able to access the CFE Web Interface at <a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a>. You can also flash the firmware by TFTP if you really want).</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://s13.postimg.org/ibtsg0zrb/image.png" alt="http://s13.postimg.org/ibtsg0zrb/image.png" /></span></p><p>Upload the OpenWrt firmware and you&#039;re done !<br />Wifi is not activated by default, you have to activate it (do not forget to activate 40Mhz mode in settings to get Wifi n but do not force 40Mhz). You can associate the Wifi LED in the LED menu. I let you discover the firmware <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Thanks to Virus since I used his patch as a base (with some modifications which were required by the last OpenWrt version).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vbelot</strong> on 28 May 2014, 19:26)</p>

The main problem is swconfig is not managing the switch in the right way so you have to install robocfg and configure the switch with it, after that you should create a init script to start your vlan configuration in every reboot (robocfg turns into default mode with a single vlan in eth1 when you reboot). If youre still interested in this i will post a step-by-step guide. Mine is fully working right now with lan port 1 as wan. Regards</p></blockquote></div><p>Hey, can you write a detail manual how to make a WAN port? I think most of the people flash this old device to openwrt because it don&#039;t have WAN port,but they need this function. Yes, that would be good thing if someone make this manual.<br />Thank you.</p></blockquote></div><br /><br /><p>Hey, </p><p>did you get this manual or maybe do you meanwhile know how to make a WAN port on WAG160n V1? It would be very helpful for me and other user. Thank you!</p>									</div>
