					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;m a beginner at using OpenWRT but I&#039;m loving it already. Everything is running fine (internet, wifi) on all clients except one thing: the computers running in my LAN (Win 7) don&#039;t see each other. Pings to them or between them gives &quot;destination host unreachable&quot;. This happens when using either the machine&#039;s IP&#039;s or their assigned hostnames.</p><p>Running Backfire 10.03.1 with LuCI 0.10.0 0 - default settings everywhere except of course for the specific ISP stuff.</p><p>What&#039;s going on? Thanks!</p><p>EDIT:<br />this has been SOLVED - see below.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>valentingalea</strong> on 27 Jun 2012, 20:47)</p>

					<p>Hmm, that doesn&#039;t sound right at all.&nbsp; The default settings should have everything as one big LAN.</p><p>Have you checked in Network, Switch to make sure you do not have the ethernet ports tagged to different VLANs?</p><p>As for why must the LAN be bridged with the wireless, its not a &quot;must&quot; but its pretty useful as its part of what allows wired and wireless devices to talk to each other as if they are physically connected to the same network.&nbsp; Technically WiFi is one network and wired is another, bridging allows you to merge them together.</p>									</div>
