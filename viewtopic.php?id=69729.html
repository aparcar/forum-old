					<p>HI,</p><p>I am trying to set up OpenWrt on a Raspberry Pi B+, and have a TL-WN722N wireless adapter that I cannot get to function correctly. </p><p>I have downloaded and installed the drivers (opkg install kmod-ath9k-htc), and then brought the wlan0 connection up and could see the interface under the ifconfig command. At this point, i ran the wifi detect command, and appended the results to /etc/config/wireless as below.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-device &#039;radio0&#039;
        option type &#039;mac80211&#039;

        option ssid &#039;OpenWrt&#039;
        option encryption &#039;none&#039;</code></pre></div><br /><p>After this, the Wifi was showing the &#039;Wireless is disabled or not associated&#039; error in luci despite being enabled.&nbsp; Following a reboot, I am now not able to see the wlan0 interface, I cannot start it, and wifi detect does not work. the error message in luci is still present but the interface is showing enabled. </p><p>This is the error message that i get when i try to start the wlan0 again</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# ifconfig wlan0 up
ifconfig: SIOCGIFFLAGS: No such device</code></pre></div><p>Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. </p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Are you sure that your device <em>really</em> uses the ath9k_htc driver?</p><p>The AR9271/ AR7010 wlan chipset has been EoL for quite a while now and newer specimens of the TL-WN722N apparently use Realtek&#039;s rtl8192eu (rtl8xxxu) chipset instead.</p>									</div>
