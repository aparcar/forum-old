					<p>@david, you must have reconfigured your web server again.&nbsp; http is now working again, but not auto-forwarding to https.&nbsp; Ideally the way it should work is if someone types in your web address without https://, it will auto-forward to https://.&nbsp; The way you had it yesterday, if someone didn&#039;t type in https://, they got a 404.</p><p>I don&#039;t know how to fix it, but look at even how Luci-SSL/uhttpd works for maybe an example.&nbsp; If you type in 192.168.1.1, it auto-forwards to <a href="https://192.168.1.1">https://192.168.1.1</a>.</p><p>Edit: It just went dead after I posted this so I assume you are working on it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Edit2: It&#039;s now redirecting perfectly, great job!! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>@Pasxalisk and others with issues, I don&#039;t mean to be an ass or come across as a jerk or anything, but before reporting an issue here, you should try the latest LEDE development branch build from <a href="https://downloads.lede-project.org/snapshots/targets/mvebu/generic/">https://downloads.lede-project.org/snap … u/generic/</a> and see if your issue exists there.&nbsp; An issue should only be reported here if it doesn&#039;t exist in the official LEDE build, but does in @david&#039;s build.&nbsp; Because if the issue exists in the official LEDE build., it&#039;s highly unlikely that @david can do anything about it.&nbsp; And if you find an issue with the official LEDE build, it should be reported as an issue on their github or in a thread on the LEDE forums, so that it hopefully will be fixed.&nbsp; Of course, if you find a work around for an issue, posting it here would of course be greatly appreciated.</p><p>Edit: I thought we had already established that your 1200V2 was defective due to its low speeds.&nbsp; This signal level issue only seems to confirm that something is physically wrong with the router.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>starcms</strong> on 2 Jun 2017, 02:52)</p>

					<p>Btw, for those who use dnscrypt, I submitted my first pull request (using github is a real bitch btw; for those that have never used it, you can only do the most very basic things from the web interface -- you need to download the git command line program to do practically everything), and version 1.9.5-4 is now out.&nbsp; It updates the resolvers list (in the dnscrypt-proxy-resolvers package) which was over 6+ months out of date (although I would still recommend using a script like the one I posted a couple pages back to update it more frequently, because the list is updated on an almost daily basis) and adds an option for log_level for dnscrypt-proxy (in /etc/config/dnscrypt-proxy).&nbsp; You can set it to 5, instead of the default of 6, to quiet much log spam.</p><p>1.9.5-4 is available now from the snapshot repo, but for those who use dnscrypt plugins, I would recommend waiting, because the version in the repo doesn&#039;t have plugin support enabled (unlike the versions that @david compiles).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>starcms</strong> on 2 Jun 2017, 03:47)</p>

I&#039;ve never experienced anything like that and since my lack of experience I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s normal.<br />3) I tried to configure a vpn client on my cellphone. It works fine when I use it through wifi connection but it doesn&#039;t when it&#039;s in LTE. is there a way to make it work? If needed I can proivide logs and configurations (now I&#039;m at work).<br />4) Is there a way to selectively route services based on dns? My netflix account and Sky Go don&#039;t work with my VPN ip.</p><br /><p>Thanks for any advice and to davidc and others for your efforts.</p></blockquote></div><p>1) The 3200ACM swaps firmware everytime you flash on it. So your last firmware is always intact. If you don&#039;t want to wipe a partition, to my knowledge, before you reflash, you need to swap to the other partition beforehand. To clarify: If you are let&#039;s say on Partition 1 and you do a firmware update. It will flash onto Partition 2 and reboot onto that new partition. And so on.</p>									</div>

You will then have your upgraded LEDE image in partition one. And the older LEDE image in partition two.</p>									</div>

And if you install from stock linksys firmware I think there&#039;s no guarantee.</p><p>But yeah if you backup your config before flashing you should be fine.

I hope to solve my issues related to VPn and then it&#039;s all fine. I also wonder if the weak wifi power is related to driver still problematic so hopefully will be solved or it&#039;s hardware related. But overall it&#039;s ok.</p>									</div>
