					<p>Hi</p><p>I just got here with openwrt because I wanted my router (WNDR3700 v1) to have Wake on Lan and a Print Server</p><p>I have done that and I have done a lot of reading about the settings etc but there is one thing I can&#039;t get my head around</p><p>It says the default interfaces for my router are: br-lan, eth0, eth1 (WAN), wlan0 and wlan1</p><p>However when I installed firmware all I got showing is br-lan, and two occurrences of eth1 one is for WAN and the other is WAN6</p><p>Question is I dont understand why it has two occurrences for WAN, both are of eth1, same MAC address etc. If I stop the WAN6 one I still have internet so can i just delete this interface?</p><p>Also what does it mean when it has a /24 after the ip address. eg my ip address for the actual router is set to 192.168.0.1 but it has /24 at the end. What is the 24 for? ta</p>									</div>

					<p>The WAN6 interface is for IPv6. If your ISP doesn&#039;t support IPv6, the WAN6 interface isn&#039;t going to do anything for you. On the other hand, its also not doing you any harm. Leave it there and you won&#039;t have to recreate it when/if your ISP adds IPv6 support.</p><p>As for the /24, that is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork">IPv4 prefix size, which is basically the subnet mask</a>.&nbsp; It means that the first 24 bits of the 32 bit IP address describe the network, and the last designates the host. So, your router is in host position 1 of the 192.168.0 network, and there are 254 other possible host addresses on that network (255 is reserved for broadcasts to all hosts on the subnet).</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks so much for the information! </p><p>I thought it may be for ipv6 but even the wan connection has a setting in it to enable native ipv6 which ive turned off anyway</p><p>One other thing the other interfaces eg wlan1, 2 and the vlan dont show up in the interfaces section although there is the option to add them if i like but i guess theres no need since everything is working anyway. Its just the wiki says all those interfaces are supposed to be present by default. Ta</p>									</div>
