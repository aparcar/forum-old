					<p>Hello</p><p>On AA 12.09 stable release on TP Link WR842ND using ath9k wireless driver, I&#039;m trying to change chanbw setting from the default of 20 to the alternative 10 or 5 Mhz, but when I do the AP stops working.&nbsp; &nbsp;iwconfig and iwinfo show it is there, but there is actually no signal.</p><p>Same on AR23 build with ath5k.</p><p>I am changing the value in &#039;option chanbw&#039; in /etc/config/wireless &#039;wifi-device&#039; section, and the value stored in <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phy0/ath9k/chanbw<br />is being set to the correct hex value. </p><p>But after a restart, the AP does not work unless the value is set to the default of 20.</p><p>I see there have been posts on this subject for earlier AA versions, but no real resolution.</p><p>Am I missing something?</p><p>Has anyone else got this working?</p><p>Or is it a bug?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p><p>T</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,tlg<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m also working to change chanbw(5MHz/10MHz), I change it using uci, then I find a strange phenomenon. UBNT device Bullet M2(the factory fireweare or OprenWRT) find the AP SSID, but they failed to communicate to each other. I check<br /> their frequency spectrum(the factory fireweare and OprenWRT) in AP mode, they are very different.So I think Ifind the problem,but how to solve it.</p><p>QQ:651255949<br />Phone:13365016231(China)</p><p>Thank you</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Guolicun</p><p>I had it working with two TP Link devices running OpenWrt once I realised that I had to set all devices to the same setting.</p><p>I will do another test to check, but it will be a week because I am away travelling at present.</p><p>I don&#039;t have a Bullet to try, but I do have a NanoStation that I can test with.</p><p>T</p>									</div>
