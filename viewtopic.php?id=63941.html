					<p>Dear forum,<br />I&#039;m still trying to set up my OpenWRT device as a VPN router and am debugging a lot. In this context I have a question that somehow sounds stupidly simple:<br />If I add a forward rule to /etc/config/firewall like this:</p><p>config forwarding<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option dest &#039;ipr&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option src &#039;lan&#039;</p><p>Where should such a rule &quot;end up&quot; in the UI? With other words: How could I use the web-UI of my router to create such a rule in the config file?</p><p>Thanks for your answers in advance<br />Norbert</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks! Now I found it. <br />Unfortunately, my router still does not forward the traffic to the&nbsp; IPR interface. Is there any guide where I can find a good introduction on how the routing on OpenWRT works? <br />Concrete question: If I allow this forward from LAN to IPR via this firewall rule, I guess that I still need some kind of counting information to tell the router that this way should actually be used.<br />In my concrete setup the OpenVPN tries to push some routes to my devices during connect but fails and I guess that this is the problem. <br />If I want all traffic to be routed thru the IPR interface, how would I add a corresponding route?<br />Sorry for more or less changing the topic in this thread.</p><p>Thanks<br />Norbert</p>									</div>
