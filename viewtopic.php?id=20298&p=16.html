					<p>I have some pictures to share for anyone who wants a serial console without opening the WRT160NL. I used an old USB-IrDA controller which I had lying around, ripped out the IrDA chip and connected wires to the pl2303 on the board. The connector for the WRT is an ethernet connector with 3 cables mounted on the back. You have to be careful when inserting the connector, but it works reliably afterwards.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://dev.archlinux.org/~thomas/serial2wrt160nl-1.jpg" alt="http://dev.archlinux.org/~thomas/serial2wrt160nl-1.jpg" /></span><br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://dev.archlinux.org/~thomas/serial2wrt160nl-2.jpg" alt="http://dev.archlinux.org/~thomas/serial2wrt160nl-2.jpg" /></span></p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;ve (sort of) had success flashing an SVN trunk build as of yesterday. I made the IDE cable serial port cable mentioned earlier in this thread up (thanks for that - what a brilliant design - works perfectly) and the device boots and Wifi appears to work on 802.11g - but I get some packet loss on n, as mentioned.</p><p>However, DHCP isn&#039;t working on the &quot;internet&quot; port, which seems to be eth1.</p><p>udhcpc starts on boot, and &#039;ps&#039; shows it running (udhcpc -i eth1), but no address. If I kill this process and then run it manually I *usually* get an address, but it is intermittent.</p><p>While trying to debug the problem I ran iptables -F, -X, -t nat -F etc to clear the firewall rules in case they were in the way.</p><p>I set a manual IP address using ipconfig, and could ping the other end. However, on occasions where udhcpc failed manually I could not ping the other end.</p><p>I installed tcpdump on the router, and it *looks* as though I do not see the ping/DHCP requests using tcpdump when the device is failing - i.e. they&#039;re going AWOL somewhere in the kernel.</p><p>I seem to be able to reproduce my problem:</p><p>- power on<br />- killall udhcpc<br />- ifconfig eth1 192.168.1.20 (eth0 port is configured as 192.168.2.1 - so this address should be valid, and 192.168.1.1 is my old router at the other end of eth1.) I don&#039;t think the router is at fault as the same problem occurs with the cable modem directly connected.</p><p>ping the wireless router at the other end - ping 192.168.1.1 - this will probably work</p><p>If I then type &#039;ifconfig eth1 down&#039; it stops working - fair enough.</p><p>If I then type &#039;ifconfig eth1 up; ifconfig eth1 192.168.1.20&#039; and then do the ping again it doesn&#039;t work.</p><p>If I type &#039;ifup wan&#039; it restarts udhcpc etc, but again no joy - the interface seems to have gone dead.</p><p>The same thing can be reproduced by typing &#039;/etc/rc.d/K40network stop; K40network start&#039;.</p><p>My /etc/config/network is as follows (I tried commenting out the switch section in case this was the problem):</p><p>config interface lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp;eth0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option type&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bridge<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; static<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr&nbsp; &nbsp;192.168.2.1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask&nbsp; 255.255.255.0</p><p>config interface wan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp;eth1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; dhcp</p><p>config switch eth1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option reset&nbsp; &nbsp; 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option enable_vlan 0 </p><p>#config switch_vlan<br />#&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option device&nbsp; &nbsp;eth1<br />#&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option vlan&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1<br />#&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option ports&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;0 1 2 3 4 5&quot;</p><p>The problem occurs with two different devices at the other end of eth1.</p><p>When it is in the failed state I can monitor traffic on eth1 - it just seems like no data gets out.</p><p>I suspect (knowing me) I&#039;m doing something *really dumb* but the intermittentness of this puzzles me. Can anyone point out the obvious post I&#039;ve missed in this forum? I&#039;ve tried reading them all but I bet I&#039;ve missed something critical!</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Colin</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve tried to update firmware using sysupgrade and after that router stopped booting. I&#039;ve connected to it using serial console, but when I turn it one it only gives some junk into the output and that&#039;s all. I can&#039;t do anything with it. On the router itself only the power led is flashing.<br />What can I do to restore the router?</p>									</div>

					<p>@SR: That is weird, I don&#039;t see anything that should break between 18666 and 18684</p><p>@aggress: Try &quot;UK&quot; instead of &quot;uk&quot; for the country. Also enable the ath9k option to ignore the EEPROM in the build. Furthermore, you can experiment with the command &quot;iw reg set UK&quot; and similar,&nbsp; check what is allowed with &quot;iw list&quot;.</p>									</div>

					<p>Is it possible that if the firmware image is large that it can somehow overwrite the bootloader part of the memory during upgrade?<br />The file was 4,5Mb (but the router should have 8Mb flash memory...).<br />If the bootloader was somehow overwritten is there a way to restore it?</p>									</div>
