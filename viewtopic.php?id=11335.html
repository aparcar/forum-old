All those resistors do is pull up the signals to Vcc, which is recommended for inputs or bidirectionals to prevent them from floating when nothing is attached. I would check the board carefully, and make sure you didn&#039;t get a solder blob somewhere. Also, a direct short across the resistor pad could cause trouble (though it shouldn&#039;t cause a boot failure?)</p><p>As an aside, I&#039;m not sure why everyone is recommending removing the pullup resistors, since, unlike the caps,&nbsp; they don&#039;t harm anything. You just have to know that they are there when working with GPIO inputs. In fact, since SPI devices DON&#039;T drive their SDOUT pins when not selected, you actually *NEED* a pull-up/down resistor to keep the wire from floating.</p><p>Note: Removing the capacitors is necessary, as they will effectively limit the signaling rate.</p>									</div>
