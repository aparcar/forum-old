					<p>This is listed as working in trunk. Just a few comments:</p><p>1) it seems <a href="http://patchwork.ozo.com/patch/470/">http://patchwork.ozo.com/patch/470/</a> was needed to get it to show up in trunk and to get the device to accept the file<br />2) once installed, it worked fine , except I had to go into failsafe and add port 5 to the vlan (it was 0 1 2 3 4) and 5 is, I believe, the port that the cpu is on</p><p>Other than that it looks good.</p>									</div>

					<p>After further investigation, it seems that the VLANing on this is a bit suspect. For example, after making the above change to add port 5, it comes up fine if you ping it all the time it&#039;s coming up. If you wait until it&#039;s up before pinging it does not work.</p><p>Essentially it seems that when the switch is in VLAN mode, packets only get through if you ping from both sides at the same time, and even then they only get through one way!</p>									</div>
