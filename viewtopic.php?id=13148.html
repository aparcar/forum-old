					<p>Has anyone tried it on a AR430W router (Airlink101 makes it). I know it isn&#039;t the best router, but has anyone tried it on there. I am trying to find some sort of replacement firmware for it. Please let me know.</p>									</div>

					<p>I tried openwrt kamikaze 7.09 on AR430W. Loading / flashing was successful and I was able to log into the router using root account.<br />Then, I installed web interface just to get things up quickly. No issues.<br />Wireless was disabled by default. On terminal, dmesg shows that wifi0 is available and atheros chipset is seen.<br />But when I enabled the radio and enabled a wifi interface through web page, the router HUNG !!!<br />My session was lost and as I didnt have any serial port access, I could not log back in.<br />The only way to get it back was - REFLASH !!! I tried kamikaze twice but no luck. <br />Finally reverted back to DD-WRT.</p><p>Can anyone please let me know what can be wrong here ?<br />I have the ImageBuilder installed and I am ready to make any change on the image if needed. If I get successful, I will post my summary and compiled binaries if needed.<br />AR430W seems to be a good router.. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Need help here... and this is a fun project.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK... GOOD NEWS.</p><p>I have solved my own problem after a couple of days.<br />I picked up latest snapshot of kamikaze 7.09 as of 4/28/08, made changes to madwifi source and then re-compiled.<br />The new generated binaries worked on Airlink101 AR430W 802.11g router. I am able to use Wifi and Lan/Wan now.<br />I will post my steps later.. need to catch up on some sleep now.. but it was a good exercise and I am off DD-WRT now <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Thanks !!!</p>									</div>
