					<p>Hello,</p><p>Today I bought a TP-Link WR740N, installed OpenWrt and wanted to install some packages to enable a VPN connection. Unfortunately, after the installation of some necessary packages, I got the error: <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# opkg install libopenssl
Installing libopenssl (1.0.1e-1) to root...
Collected errors:
 * verify_pkg_installable: Only have 208kb available on filesystem /overlay, pkg libopenssl needs 623
 * opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package libopenssl.</code></pre></div><p>df helped me to examine this problem: <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# df -k
