					<p>Hello,</p><p>I use openwrt, and recently, I hade a problem with my mail server.<br />For some mails sometimes, he tells me an error message</p><p>It tells me that this error occurs with routers, firewalls and proxies and if I&#039;m using a router, that I have to have the MTU setting is at 1500<br />The error can occur when the local network system aborts a connection. This would occur if WinSock aborts an established connection after data retransmission fails (receiver never acknowledges data sent on a datastream socket).<br />TCP/IP scenario: A connection will timeout if the local system doesn&#039;t receive an (ACK)nowledgement for data sent. It would also timeout if a (FIN)ish TCP packet is not ACK&#039;d (and even if the FIN is ACK&#039;d, it will eventually timeout if a FIN is not returned).</p><p>I&#039;m asking if a software p2p can cause that, if he has many connections. (600 connexions in the same time, I put in my p2p soft).</p><p>How can I optimize openwrt with a p2p software? and also to try to optimize the connexions in my mail server?</p><p>Thanks :-)</p><p>Bye</p>									</div>

					<p>Your details are a bit sparse.... It is technically possible, that a &quot;mail connection&quot; is aborted if the ACK&#039;s are dropped to often. Two remarks:</p><p>a) With 600 connections you better have a mighty big upstream;<br />b) try one of the QoS scripts that prioritize traffic, especially ACK packets.</p>									</div>
