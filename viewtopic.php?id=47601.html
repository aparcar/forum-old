					<p>Hey everyone, i have a few related question on split horizon DNS on the openwrt. i have an internal webserver, and would prefer if i could address from inside and outside my network with the same names. My external address is home.example.com</p><p>1) if i use the server=/home.example.com/192.168.1.20 that will redirect all DNS requests to home.example.com to my internal webserver, does this webserver need to be running a DNS server? or will an apache virtualhost servername do?</p><p>2) how would i redirect sub sub domains such as sb.home.example.com to the server? are there wildcard options for the server command?</p><p>3) if i only need to redirect simple domain names, do i even need to use server directive? can i use my openwrt router as my dns server instead? </p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>1) apache virtualhost servername is enough since the webrowser sends the hostname in the http(s) request header.</p><p>2) dnsmasq resolves home.example.com to 192.168.1.20 , the webserver doesn&#039;t need a dns server for this</p><p>3) yes dnsmasq on the router would be enough (see 1 and 2)</p><p>p.s. This isn&#039;t split horizon either, split horizon dns is a dns that could resolve at the wan side a different answer then the lan side. see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-horizon_DNS">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-horizon_DNS</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>FriedZombie</strong> on 29 Nov 2013, 11:49)</p>

					<p>Hi,<br />I think what i have is a bit too complicated for what i need.<br />I can&#039;t get it to resolves the NX domain for some reason.</p><p>i have the domain home.example.com pointed my my home IP and i have my router set up to forward 443 and 80 to my internal webserver. So any time i load plex.home.example.com it should connect to my plex server (using apache virtual hosts). </p><p>internally i have to call webserver:9090 to connect to it. I would like it so that on my internal and external can connect to the server using plex.home.example.com. I was told the best way to achieve this was to use split horizon dns. </p><p>But really, i just need my internal network to resolve the name plex.home.example.com to my internal server. could i just do this with a simple address redirect? </p><p>DNSmasq looks like it has a address=/home.andrew-taylor.ca/webserver/ but that isn&#039;t avaiable in the list proveded on the wiki (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/dhcp">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/dhcp</a>)</p><p>i tried using the server=/ / method, but whenever i did an nslookup on home.andrew-taylor.ca it told me the it couldn&#039;t find the nx domain</p>									</div>

					<p>just add a domain option under: /etc/config/dhcp<br />probably more then enough for what you want to do</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config domain
