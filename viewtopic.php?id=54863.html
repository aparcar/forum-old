					<p>Hello.<br />I am doing some test in order to configure fine the router, but some times I make mistakes that forbids me to connect to the router in any way. Then I have to reboot the router in safe mode pressing the reset button at boot in order to run &quot;firstboot&quot;.<br />BUT.... The router is in the top of a pipe 6 m long in the roof and I have to unmount all to press the reset button and I have to loose too much time with that (not mentioning if it is raining).</p><p>The question is if is it any way to get that all the config files in /etc/config could be restored (or copied from a location) every boot. In this way, if I make mistakes, I only have to reboot disconnecting the power supply from the room.</p><p>Thank you very much :-)</p><p>Happy new year :-D</p>									</div>

					<p>You might need to reboot router again after some major config changes (like network IP address space changes), so just restoring config files might not be enough. You might need to reboot again...</p><p>But look into /etc/rc.local file. Commands in it are run at the end of the boot process. You might utilize that. E.g. check a flag file, and if not there, restore config, set flag file and reboot. (and if the flag file is there, remove it so that the next reboot will again lead into restore-reboot, but do not reboot now.)</p><p>Other option: <br />You can include &quot;custom files&quot; to your build in the firmware compilation or image generator usage. Use a live router and configure network &amp; wifi etc as you like. Then store the key config files /etc/config/network etc. as &lt;buildroot&gt;/files/etc/config/network </p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build#custom.files">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build#custom.files</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtain.firmware.generate#files.variable">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtai â€¦ s.variable</a></p><p>Combine that to the /etc/rc.local approach, so that you can use &quot;firstboot&quot; command to reset all changes to the original contents of the flashed firmware.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 2 Jan 2015, 14:55)</p>
