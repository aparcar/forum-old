					<p>Hi. I was just wondering, is the RC5-release found <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/backfire/10.03.1-RC5-testing/ar71xx/">here</a> ready for use, or is it a &quot;pre-rc&quot; release of some sort? I&#039;m wondering since it&#039;s located under &quot;snapshots/backfire&quot; instead of under &quot;backfire&quot;, as has been the norm. Also, there&#039;s no announcement on the front page. I&#039;m about to set up a new router, but since I&#039;m not in a rush I thought I&#039;d wait until RC5 is actually out, avoiding trunk if I can (RC4 is not an option due to WNDR3700v2 hardware).</p><p>Thanks for any info on this.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gspr</strong> on 6 May 2011, 17:16)</p>

					<p>rc5 is not yet officially out, but those bytes might quite well prove to be a rather thorough test build for rc5.&nbsp; I think that I visited that snapshot directory after April 29th and then there were still be earlier test builds from early April, so that April 29th build has surfaced there later. The SVN revision numbers vary between chipsets (at least svn r26774-r26786), so it does not look like to be a uniformly built version. So, does not quite look as a final one.</p><p>On the other hand, it looks like a complete set of modules, so you might test it. It is probably the only ready-made complete set of packages compatible for wndr3700v2. </p><p>If you install it, then configure your system to fetch additional packages from the same snapshot directory, so that you get uniformly built modules: edit /etc/opkg.conf to point into that location.</p><p>(...and even if something goes wrong, the unbricking of wndr3700 is rather easy. Just follow the advice in Wiki.)</p>									</div>
