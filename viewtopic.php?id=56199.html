					<p>Hi again...</p><p>I need to setup a wifi connection using multi-ssid and VLANs, so I can divert and isolate traffic to different users. One of these user groups have to be authenticated on our LDAP server, using WPA2-Enterprise.</p><p>The original WA-901ND firmware offers me WPA2-Enterprise, VLANs and multi-ssid, but I cannot use all of them together. :X</p><p>I can use multi-ssid and vlans, but only with WPA2-PSK. If I use AP mode, I can use WPA2-Enterprise, but no VLAN tagging.</p><p>So I decided to flash OpenWRT on the device and give it a try; but when I readed the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start#tp-link">Table Of Hardware</a>, it says that WA-901ND isn&#039;t capable of VLAN tagging. Is it true?</p>									</div>
