					<p>1. You did not read the links provided by zajec.</p><p>Why did I come for this conclusion?</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dd copies a file (from standard input to standard output, by default) with a changeable I/O block size, while optionally performing conversions on it. Synopses:

     dd [operand]...
     dd option

â€˜if=fileâ€™
    Read from file instead of standard input.
â€˜of=fileâ€™
    Write to file instead of standard output. Unless â€˜conv=notruncâ€™ is given, dd truncates file to zero bytes (or the size specified with â€˜seek=â€™). 

â€˜bs=bytesâ€™
    Set both input and output block sizes to bytes. This makes dd read and write bytes per block, overriding any â€˜ibsâ€™ and â€˜obsâ€™ settings. In addition, if no data-transforming conv option is specified, input is copied to the output as soon as it&#039;s read, even if it is smaller than the block size. 

â€˜skip=nâ€™
    Skip n â€˜ibsâ€™-byte blocks in the input file before copying. If â€˜iflag=skip_bytesâ€™ is specified, n is interpreted as a byte count rather than a block count. </code></pre></div><p>However: The dd tool is not available on Windows &quot;normally&quot;. You have to install additional Software to get dd.<br />The Cygwin Project provides it - read / download at <a href="http://cygwin.com/">http://cygwin.com/</a><br />OR<br />Installing the free VirtualBox program to setup a Virtual Machine (VM). In it you can install Linux and have access to dd. You can access the files that you made from inside the VM through many different ways (Shared Folders, FTP Server, send email to yourself ...)</p><br /><p>A Hex Editor is similar to a text editor.<br />Instead of text it shows the files binary code as hex.<br />Instead of TEXT you can edit the FIRMWARE BIN file for example.</p><p>So how to use it?<br />1. Open the file<br />2. Mark 32 bytes (1 byte is 8 bits = values from 0x00 to 0xFF so 32 x &quot;__&quot; )<br />3. Delete marked bytes<br />4. save file<br />5. Your file should now be 32 bytes smaller</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_editor">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_editor</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi<br />I am having very hard time trying to convert my .bin file to .trx. I am following the steps but somehow it doesn&#039;t work, so I was wondering if one of you binary geniuses would be so kind and convert my .bin file into .trx so I can come back to the original firmware as OpenWrt didn&#039;t work for me. I would be so grateful. :DDDD</p><p>here is my .bin file <a href="http://www.ekspedycjamichal.pl/mr3420v2_pl_3_16_9_up_boot(150902)L850V.bin">http://www.ekspedycjamichal.pl/mr3420v2 â€¦ )L850V.bin</a></p>									</div>
