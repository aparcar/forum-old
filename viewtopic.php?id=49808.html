					<p>Hi,</p><p>I solved almost all my issues with this router. (WD-My Net N600)<br />But I still have 2 issues:<br />1-I have a large library and my db file it&#039;s to large (about 25MB) to by stored in the router memory (can&#039;t generate entire file and restart the router). So, I moved db file to external hdd (ext4). My issue is that sometime don&#039;t load the file (show 0 files shared) and sometimes don&#039;t update the file with new media files added. I think that my issue is because my hdd don&#039;t spin up before minidlna to start (I&#039;m not sure). Can anyone help me with this?</p><p>2-The same hdd have one more ntfs partition. I can mount it from putty only with ntfs-3g command (I can&#039;t mount it from luci, I don&#039;t know why) but occasionally it unmount by himself.<br />I used hotplug script written into 10-mount file (to automount ntfs partitions) but it creates to many sda, sdb, sdc.... mount points and have issues with samba.<br />I don&#039;t know/found if ntfs partition have an UUID to load with (like ext4 partition).<br />Have anyone any idea to mount ntfs partition and to stay there?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
