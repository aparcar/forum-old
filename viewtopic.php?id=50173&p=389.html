					<p>I already did, but the wifi issue is still persistent. In the change log is also written, that they added dfs support, nothing else.</p><p>With .16 I have the problem, that some devices (nexus 9, surface pro 4) have very high ping times.

					<p>This is how I set up my network to allow for a separate network for my servers - these are in my /etc/config/network.</p><p>Enable first the vlan options on the switch:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config switch
    option name &#039;switch0&#039;
    option reset &#039;1&#039;
    option enable_vlan &#039;1&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Ports 2,3 and 4 - the switch numbers them as 0,1 and 2 - are untagged on VLAN 1. Port 5 is the switch CPU, &#039;t&#039; means it&#039;s tagged, since it will appear on more than one VLAN.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config switch_vlan
    option device &#039;switch0&#039;
    option vlan &#039;1&#039;
    option vid &#039;1&#039;
    option ports &#039;0 1 2 5t&#039;</code></pre></div><p>This is my WAN port - now on VLAN 2 - the number of the port on the switch is 4:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config switch_vlan
    option device &#039;switch0&#039;
    option vlan &#039;2&#039;
    option vid &#039;2&#039;
    option ports &#039;4 5t&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Finally my server side VLAN, it&#039;s number 3 and it includes only the first port on the router - numbered 3 on the switch:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config switch_vlan
    option device &#039;switch0&#039;
    option vlan &#039;3&#039;
    option vid &#039;3&#039;
    option ports &#039;3 5t&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Now the configuration of the LAN bridge, where all the clients (wifi and ports 2,3 and 4) are sitting. This is bound to<br />VLAN 1 on the <strong>eth0.1</strong> interface:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;lan&#039;
    option type &#039;bridge&#039;
    option ifname &#039;eth0.1&#039;
    option proto &#039;static&#039;
    option ipaddr &#039;192.168.66.1&#039;
    option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;
    option ip6assign &#039;60&#039;</code></pre></div><p>The WAN is attached to the second VLAN - <strong>eth0.2</strong>: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;wan&#039;
    option ifname &#039;eth0.2&#039;
    option proto &#039;dhcp&#039;</code></pre></div><p>And this is my server interface, bound to VLAN 3 via the <strong>eth0.3</strong> interface, I have spanning tree protocol enabled on this interface:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;server&#039;
    option type &#039;bridge&#039;
    option proto &#039;static&#039;
    option ifname &#039;eth0.3&#039;
    option ipaddr &#039;172.10.0.1&#039;
    option netmask &#039;255.255.0.0&#039;
    option stp &#039;1&#039;</code></pre></div><p>You can do most of this configuration also using the web interface from <strong>Network-&gt;Switch</strong>.</p><p>VLAN 1 - Ports 0,1,2: untagged; Ports 3,4:&nbsp; off; CPU: tagged; Port 6: off -- Port 6 is actually the CPU seen from the WAN port;<br />VLAN 2 - Ports 0,1,2,3: off; Port 4: untagged; CPU: tagged; Port 6: off -- This is the WAN port<br />VLAN 3 - Ports 0,1,2,4: off; Port 3: untagged; CPU: tagged; Port 6: off -- This is the server VLAN</p><p>I suggest you connect to the router using wifi while playing with the switch -- it&#039;s going to make you life easier.</p><p>Creating the VLANs is only the beginning: you also have to create a zone for the lan you have just created and setup the rules to allow -- or not -- the traffic.</p>									</div>
