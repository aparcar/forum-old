					<p>What do you mean, &quot;extract a firmware&quot;? A flash dump? That&#039;s actually what <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.backup">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.backup</a> and similar procedures do, of course the flash partitions vary depending on your router.</p>									</div>

					<p>CMIIW, but in a &quot;mass deploying&quot; scenario* this would actually be <em>more</em> work. You would have to get the new machine to a point where you can use scp or wget to transfer the cloned image <span style="color: #aaa">(Edit: Deletia, you don&#039;t need mtd)</span>. Meaning you&#039;d have to either have a router you can somehow get shell access to, or, more likely, install OpenWrt the &quot;regular&quot; way. At which point you could already be installing your own preconfigured image.</p><p>That being said I believe that, yes, it is possible to clone OpenWrt between completely identical machines. You&#039;d obviously not clone <em>all</em> partitions (especially not the ARP tables) and you should really know what you&#039;re doing though. I am not familiar with what dd/mtd does with bad blocks, though, so someone should comment on that.</p><p>*) Obviously not on a manufacturing scale.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 31 Aug 2014, 22:04)</p>
