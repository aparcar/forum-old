					<p>Ok so i recently bought a linksys WRT1200ac router. I have previous experience with ddwrt and wanted to try OpenWRT. I went and found the page for my router</p><p><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1200ac">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1200ac</a></p><p>I go down to select an image and choose one from the list here:</p><p><a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/people/kaloz/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/people/kaloz/</a></p><p>specifically, openwrt-mvebu-armada-xp-linksys-mamba-squashfs-factory.img</p><p>These images were said to be trunk and have additional packages and the LUCI gui. saves me time<br />I take my router out of the box and set it up, power it, and connect it to my desktop via ethernet. I go to my brower in windows 7 and connect to 192.168.1.1. The stock linksys firmware runs and the Smart wifi wizard pops up and i ignore it and go to manual configuration. Under connectivity i find where i can manually update the firmware and select the image i downloaded above. Flash. </p><p>A loading bar pops up and i wait a bit for it to finish. When it does another pop up come up that says something about not begin able to identify my router or something. I cant remember because i only saw it once. I think it was due to the fact that the old linksys firmware was not running on the router but was in the browser. i dont know. Either way i refresh the page to connect to the new firmware i just flashed. i get a server not found/problem loading page message. </p><p>I look down at the windows taskbar at my network connection icon and it shows disconnection. I look at the router and the power indicator light is flashing slowly. One of the LAN port lights is lit/flickering. I restart my computer and go and turn off both my modem and router. then i repower them. When im back at the desktop the network icon shows that i am identifying network. It then shows connected to network(unidentified network) and no internet access. </p><p>I go to the browser and try to connect to 192.168.1.1 again. Nothing. <br />I go to cmd and try to ping 192.168.1.1. All four packets say:<br />PING: transmit failed. general failure.</p><p>i try to telnet into 192.168.1.1. It says <br />Could not open connection to host on port 23. Connection failed. <br />same with telnet into 192.168.1.1/24</p><p>I type ipconfig. General stuff comes up however under default gateway there is just a blank space where the ip address would normally be. My internal IP begins with 169, indicating to me that windows assigned it, not the router. </p><p>I cannot figure out my routes ip address. <br />I cannot access my router. <br />For some reason i can connect to it (according to windows) but it shows no IP, is unidentified, and i cant do anything with it.</p><p>I attempt to enter failsafe by pressing the reset button on the router while its booting. However the power light doesnt change frequency of blinking. i expect flashes per second but it stays at the slow blinking speed. </p><p>I have no idea what to do and really hope i didnt just waste $150 in 5 mins. <br />Any help or ideas would be greatly appreciated. </p><p>-Mack</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>preciseknife</strong> on 22 Nov 2015, 00:00)</p>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>try to shrink text, otherwise people won&#039;t read and thus won&#039;t help.<br />Also please try to make your topic more understandable, add router type e.g.</p><p>Have you tried this page?<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe</a></p><p>I assume that you flashed a firmware that&#039;s for some reason not usable. Usually you can revive the router. In my experience it&#039;s very seldom to fully brick a device irreversibly just by flashing it.</p>									</div>

					<p>@juni</p><p>thank you for the advice i will make sure do to so in the future. im sure it is not completely bricked. i just need to find time to completely read through the failsafe documentation and do what i can. </p><p>@JohhnySL</p><p>that sir is exactly what i did. it seems i did not read carefully enough. thanks for the catch. that will make reflashing later much easier. </p><br /><p>thank you guys for the responses i was really worried that my post would have been lost. </p><p>-Mack</p>									</div>
