					<p>Hello.</p><p>I have a custom problem. My task is to assure connection to moving mobile robot witch router TP-Link WDR3500 in network of AP (in my case Aruba). Most important thing is to keep stable connection, so i need fast roaming. Also important that I need to connect trough ssh in both ways. I discover OpenWRT last week and tried:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode</a><br />and<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient</a><br />, but I have a problem that router switch AP only if lost connection to actual AP. In my case AP are close to each other, because I need good signal level all time. </p><p>Maybe someone knows solution or another way to create such network <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Thanks for all answers.<br />Maciek</p>									</div>

					<p>If you own/control the AP&#039;s, I suggest running a mesh network.&nbsp; AP-STA systems just don&#039;t handle roaming/moving clients well.</p><p>If the robot is aware of its location it could run a script to force a connect to different AP&#039;s as it moves in and out of pre-defined coverage areas.&nbsp; Thus it would know it should connect to a &quot;better&quot; AP (and which AP that is) before signal is lost.</p>									</div>
