					<p>I&#039;m posting this information here in case it&#039;s useful to anyone else.</p><p>I was having reliability problems with Soekris boxes running Kamikaze 7.09, with miniPCI atheros cards, making WPA2 client connections to a Cisco 877W access point. Quite often they would not establish the connection, and needed wpa_supplicant restarting by hand to make them work. Sometimes they would fail after a period of time too.</p><p>In summary, adding the following options to /etc/config/wireless seems to make things work much better:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>    option agmode bg
    option bgscan 0</code></pre></div><p>A bit more detail: I had three Soekris boxes on my desk for testing, one with a Compex bg card and two Aries abg cards. WIth a number of power cycles I found that quite often the unit with the bg card seemed to come up when the two abg units didn&#039;t. Disabling 802.11a (using &quot;option agmode bg&quot;) seemed to improve things a lot.</p><p>I think that&#039;s what&#039;s happening is that wpa_supplicant&#039;s scan for access points is conflicting with the Atheros&#039; own AP scanning. I modified /lib/wifi/madwifi.sh to log wpa_supplicant&#039;s output to a file. This meant I could compare the failing authentication with a successful one (after restarting wpa_supplicant)</p><p>When it was failing, it got into an infinite loop of trying to associate and then disconnecting:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>$ grep -- &#039;State.*-&gt;\|[0-9] of [0-9]\|[0-9]/[0-9]&#039; wpa.log.failing | head -30

I now can&#039;t replicate the problem on my desk by rebooting the clients or the AP, although that doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s gone away completely!</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Brian.</p>									</div>
