					<p>I&#039;ve been using LTE modem for a while now.<br />The first approach with e398 failed, then I bought an e3276 in hilink version. The latter is important, because hilink modems don&#039;t require ANY driver to work with. They just appear in the system as another eth interface. <br />To be precise: I use openwrt-BB. The CC apparently supports modems much better.</p>									</div>
