					<p>Hello all,<br />I&#039;m trying to setup a guest VAP alongside my normal AP and run both through one cable (from one port) to one port on my managed switch.</p><p>The diagram in <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=42709">this setup</a> is very close to what I am doing, and the solution (a few posts down in the topic) is what I&#039;m trying to use as the basis for my recipe.<br />Essentially, my gn should look like the access point 1 when this is setup correctly. It should just be an AP providing two VAPs, each going out on a specific vlan.</p><p>Unlike the other post:<br />1. I don&#039;t need three VAP/VLANs, I need two.<br />2. The whr-hp-gn has a dedicated wan port.&nbsp; That means that the configuration used in the above example will not work for me directly.<br />3. I&#039;ve tried to do this through both the wan port, and Lan ports with no success.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-device &#039;radio0&#039;
