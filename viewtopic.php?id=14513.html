					<p>I don&#039;t how did you retrieve your openwrt source; however, I don&#039;t see any feeds/https_svn.openwrt.org_openwrt_packages_ directory on my build that was retrieved through the SVN trunk. As a matter of fact, I just tried to retrieve the source again on other computer and still didn&#039;t see such a directory. I have no problem to complete the build on the firmware + asterisk v1.4.11, except the asterisk build could not produce codec_gsm.so file (see my post <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=14524">here</a>.

					<p>I have looked a bit into uClibc++ Makefile and it uses $(1) for staging dir and $(2) for host staging dir. I have inserted few echo lines, and it appears that $(2) is not set. So, this Makefile is just fine, i will look for the error in some other place.. <br />Quite a nice exercise for learning how openwrt build system works <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>I did run the &quot;scripts/feeds update&quot; and it performs the update but no <em>https_svn.openwrt.org_openwrt_packages</em> directory. I am not sure if it makes any different because I started out doing this <strong>svn co <a href="https://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk/">https://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk/</a></strong> to retrieve openwrt SVN trunk.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mazilo</strong> on 15 Feb 2008, 22:23)</p>

					<p>Yes, now i have updated all Kamikaze files from svn and after cleaning up there is no more &quot;https_svn.openwrt.org_openwrt_packages&quot; folder in feeds, only actual package folders. </p><p>@tl71<br />Thnx, that solves it.</p>									</div>
