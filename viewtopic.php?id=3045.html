					<p>Hello,</p><p>damn, I bricked a WRT54g. I flashed the original Linksys-firmware with WR RC3 once, which worked (not through tftp though, but through the webfrontend, although I switched boot_waid=on through ping-bug). I flashed a second time, because I forgot to compile start-stop-daemon into busybox.</p><p>The 2nd flash didn&#039;t work through tftp either, so I did it with the proposed &quot;mtd -e linux -r write openwrt-xxx-xxx.trx linux&quot; (before that I ran &quot;dd if=openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin of=firmware.trx bs=32 skip=1&quot; to get a working image.</p><p>The device flashed, rebooted and is now in a bricked state, where only the power-led keeps blinking. No DMZ- or wifi-led, so failsafe-mode is not an option. The device is not pingable, although about 70 % of the packets get lost.</p><p>What might be the problem? Is there any hope? And especially: why could that happen? I flashed a lot of Asus- and older WRT54g-routers, but never a v 3.1. Is there any special behaviour on these devices?</p><p>Thanks a lot in advance for any help,<br />--Sinus</p>									</div>

See my <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=3055">other post</a>. As to why your initial flash of WR doesn&#039;t seem to work I don&#039;t have a clue. I&#039;ve flashed at least a dozen v3.1 linksys&#039;s and never had a problem on initial flash other than once having to manually run firstboot. But bear in mind that the initial flash will take a while because of firstboot.</p><p>- DL</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dl</strong> on 28 Oct 2005, 00:56)</p>

Also I&#039;ve found shorting to the antenna ground block to be much more reliable than simply shorting between pins.</p><p>- DL</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you a lot. I opened the case (the warranty sign is destroyed now), shorted the pins and could flash again.</p><p>Now the next problem comes up: I can flash jffs-images, but squashfs-images fail to boot. They seem to boot correctly regarding the led-states, but I&#039;m not able to access the device.</p><p>I erased OpenWrt- and Linux-&quot;partitions&quot;, but still squashfs fails. This might be due to the smaller size of the image, but still I have no clue how to tell squashfs-partitions not to access the broken parts. I can activate failsafe-mode and it starts, but the device remains unaccessable.</p><p>What can I do here, since I want to use the squashfs-version?</p>									</div>

					<p>Regarding worrying about voiding the warranty. Wouldn&#039;t installing a firmware other than the official Linksys firmware void the warranty? In fact just running the ping hack to enable boot_wait might be enough to void the warranty. I haven&#039;t actually read the warranty but I can&#039;t imagine that the actions already taken didn&#039;t void it. There just isn&#039;t any outside physical evidence of it. Maybe I&#039;m too honest but I wouldn&#039;t send it in if I bricked it installing a 3rd party firmware. Luckily I&#039;ve only bricked one of mine one time and luckily there was someone on these forums that explained how to unbrick it by shorting the pins (which was the basis of my unbricking page). Now I have 3 of these stupid little things and a few more at work doing various things they were never designed to do. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Regarding your squashfs not working. Could it be a corrupt image? That&#039;s all I&#039;ve ever used. I have uploaded them and not have them properly boot after installing but I was able to boot failsafe mode, log in and run &quot;firstboot&quot; and everything was fine after that.</p>									</div>
