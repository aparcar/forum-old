					<p>I am trying to build OpenWRT for TpLink router, with some cool features enabled.<br />Mktplinkfw refuses to build a final squashfs-factory.bin image, because it thinks that -F 4M (4MB is a size of flash chip)<br />is not enough... However, if I try to build with -F 8M (for 8MB flash chip size) and then open the resulting factory bin<br />in a hex editor, I see that only the first 3.5MB are occupied by not-FF data!<br />The remaining 4.5MB are filled with FF, and seem to be unused.</p><p>So I cant understand, why it refuses to build - while there seem to be 0.5MB free space available, out of the first 4MB...</p><p>1) Is it a mktplinkfw bug, so maybe I can bug report this behaviour?<br />2) Could I just build a 8MB image, and then cut it manually to first 4MB? (where only 3.5MB would contain non-FF data)</p>									</div>
