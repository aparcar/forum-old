					<p>My WL-500g was stable for a week with a pre-RC5 snapshot and the b44 ethernet-driver until this morning. This morning, the device didn&#039;t respond, so I disconnected the WAN-Port, rebooted and could access the Router again. Everything seems as normal, but when I replug the WAN cable, the current SSH session dies and the WAN-LED starts flashing slowly and regularly (that&#039;s unusual!). If I disconnect the WAN-cable, another SSH-login is possible. </p><p>If I connect the very same cable directly to a switch-port, all connected LAN-LEDs blink like mad and the device again stops responding (although pings are possible).</p><p>Maybe a speed-mismatch is the problem: I noticed during bootup, that eth1 (WAN) was configured as 100Mbps-FD, but the network I&#039;m connected to via WAN-port runs on 10Mbps-HD. </p><p>How can I force the b44-driver to 10Mbps-HD?</p><p>Maybe it works via a Switch, but I don&#039;t have one handy right now, I&#039;ll have to wait until next week.</p><p>thanks, <br />andy</p>									</div>

					<p>i finally had the possibility to test this out: unfortunately, that didn&#039;t work. i was able to establish a connection, but after 395minutes, no packets could be sent anymore, not even, after replugging the cable. <br />i tried connectin via a switch (my braindead siemens se-505v2) and it seems to be working alright, however i&#039;ll have to test this more. </p><p>i think i&#039;ll also try the newest nbd-snapshot as there were new patches for b55 integrated.</p><br /><p>greetings, <br />andy</p>									</div>

					<p>ok, today the link died even when connected via the switch, so it seems i&#039;m suffering from the same problems as davide125. i just flashed the latest nbd-snapshot, the recent b44-workaround for the 500-g should be integrated, am i right?</p><p>andy</p>									</div>
