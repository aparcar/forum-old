When you have the same thing available on net with openWrt<br />We can any day install open wrt or dd-wrt or mikrotik and run our network very well. Even now also x-wrt and Gargoyle will provide you a GUI for openWrt.<br />We just wanted to have our logo to the GUI so that it gives nice lil impression to our clients, that&#039;s all.<br />Or may be if possible wanted to remove few options from GUI.<br />Feel free to comment Sir.</p><p>Uttam</p>									</div>

					<p>Buffalo has been known to preinstall DD-WRT on their routers (WZR-HP-G300NH, WHR-HP-G300N and WHR-HP-GN ). So if DD works, you should not have a problem flashing OpenWRT over it. Just look for ISP&#039;s that carry Buffalo devices.<br />I am not sure you will find ANY consumer devices that have OpenWRT preinstalled, not here in the US anyways. Somehow DD-WRT managed to suck up to Buffalo to have them install it as a default firmware.</p>									</div>
