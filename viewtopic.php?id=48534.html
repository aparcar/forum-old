					<p>I have followed some googling and gotten autossh to work.</p><p>From the command line (without -f) I am able to see it work.</p><p>I am trying to have the remote openwrt phone home when it starts, and open up some ports for me to reverse ssh on. e.g. ssh and http.</p><p>The local (non-wrt) userid is set to use rssh. (From cygwin machines, all is well, using -f to autossh to have ssh go into the background, since this is used for port forwarding only. These accounts / rssh are allowed to do port forwarding only, no scp, sftp, etc.)</p><p>However, autossh docs says -f needs an (ssh) command to run.</p><p>With -f, whether it be as an autossh option or a ssh option, running autossh from the command line immediately returns. ps shows no autossh or ssh running.</p><p>Running without -f but appending &amp; to run it in the background, things work as expected. Until I hit enter.</p><p>Strangely, using &lt;/dev/null makes things work as expected. Until I put it in a script.</p><p>(1) How to make openwrt, autossh, and rssh work?</p><p>(2) Could autossh -f be updated to go into the background without an addtional command, such as sftp.</p>									</div>
