					<p>Does anyone know how to specify the order that the wireless phy are detected?</p><p>Recently i have upgraded my openwrt build to latest trunk and the PHY order was inverted phy0 became phy1 and phy1 became phy0 also ifname has also reordered wlan0 became wlan1 and so on..</p><p>I was looking for a solution to specify the order on source code or something, i&#039;ve noticed that the detection follows the IRQ order, maybe thats why it changed orders, but it is strange, because on last CC build it was normal.</p><p>I have a lot of scripts that work on PHY and WLAN names i was not planning to change everyone, so if anyone can help me with this i would be very thankful.</p>									</div>
