					<p>Hi,<br />I have been trying for days to configure a link smart 7688 as a wifi access point.<br />I have the linkit 7688 mounted on a manufacturer development board that has an Ethernet connector.</p><p>After a factory reset it defaults to a WiFi AP and I can access Luci.<br />After quite some trying, I can get the ethernet port to work, but then the WiFi AP doesn&#039;t work.</p><p>I am really lost and don&#039;t know what to try next. Hours and hours of searching and reading others guides and examples has me no closer to a solution.</p><p>I can use both the LuCI interface or connect via SSH.</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>									</div>
