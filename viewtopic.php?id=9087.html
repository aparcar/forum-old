					<p>I could use some help with a package, I am trying to add smbfs support and found there was a package for kmod-smbfs for rev 393. I would linke to build and install this package in white russian rc6 as I can not get a cifs mount to work for me</p><p>My problem is I can smbclient in to the NAS vantec nexstar lx with a 250 gig fat 32( only file system it supports), dd-wrt works great with fsautomount and the only thing I can think of is to load smbfs support to get smbmount to work, I have tried cifs over hundreds of times with no success.</p><p>can some tell me if I am on the right path and if so how I could build the package, thanks</p>									</div>
