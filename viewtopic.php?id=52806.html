					<p>Hi!</p><p>I&#039;m having some difficulty related to OpenVPN that I&#039;m hoping someone can help with. I assume it&#039;s just my syntax that&#039;s wrong, but I&#039;ll leave that up to someone with more experience to say.</p><p>What I&#039;m trying to do is to add an additional (client) OpenVPN instance to my TP-LINK TL-WR740N v4, running AA r36088. The problem is that I want to have the existing(server) instance push the network from the second instance as well to its clients(I&#039;ll figure out the routing part of it afterwards).<br />Up until now, in /etc/config/openvpn I&#039;ve had:</p><p>...<br />push &quot;route 10.70.67.0 255.255.255.128&quot; #my lan<br />...</p><p>.. and that worked fine.</p><p>However, now I&#039;m changing it to:<br />...<br />push &quot;route 10.70.67.0 255.255.255.128&quot;<br /># my lan<br />push &quot;route 10.47.34.0 255.255.255.0&quot;<br /># remote lan+vpn sn over client vpn, where lan is 10.47.34.0/25, and vpn is 10.47.34.128/26<br />...</p><p>As a result, the parser only seems to honor the second line(or whichever one is last), and the routes before it never get pushed to the client.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried lines similar to:<br />push &quot;route 10.70.67.0 255.255.255.128 route 10.47.34.0 255.255.255.0&quot;<br />.. and..<br />push &quot;route 10.70.67.0 255.255.255.128; route 10.47.34.0 255.255.255.0&quot;<br />.. however both of these will break the line altogether and only the VPN network(10.70.67.128/26)&#039;s route will get pushed to the client.</p><p>Any ideas on how I can phrase the config in a way that the server pushes both(and in the future more) routes?</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>

					<p>I am encountering the same issue on 14.07 barrier breaker.</p><p>Any way to fix this? The official openVPN documentation says that the push route each get a own line.</p><p># Push routes to the client to allow it<br /># to reach other private subnets behind<br /># the server.&nbsp; Remember that these<br /># private subnets will also need<br /># to know to route the OpenVPN client<br /># address pool (10.8.0.0/255.255.255.0)<br /># back to the OpenVPN server.<br />;push &quot;route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0&quot;<br />;push &quot;route 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0&quot;</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok i just solved it.</p><p>You need to use &quot;list&quot; instead of &quot;option&quot;. e.g.</p><br /><p>option server &#039;10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0&#039;<br />...<br />list push &#039;route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0&#039;<br />list push &#039;route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0&#039;<br />...<br />option keepalive &#039;10 120&#039;<br />option comp_lzo &#039;yes&#039;</p><p>This is because the UCI expects you to use &quot;list&quot; when using the same option more then once. In this case the option push is being used twice. So &quot;option&quot; needs to be changed to &quot;list&quot;.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>boni_1983</strong> on 14 Nov 2014, 17:33)</p>
