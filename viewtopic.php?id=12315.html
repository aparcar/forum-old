					<p>Hi all.</p><p>A few weeks ago, I stumbled on this site, and <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=11952">asked for some advice in my first (and only previous) post here.</a></p><p>I must admit I was skeptical -- and scared.&nbsp; </p><p>Tonight, my router locked up 5 times in ~20 minutes.&nbsp; In a fit of rage, I installed the X-WRT FW (0.9) I&#039;d downloaded after my previous question.</p><p>I am amazed.&nbsp; It actually preserved almost all of my previous settings -- the only one I noticed it missed was the DNS Servers for DHCP.</p><p>This works AMAZINGLY well!!</p><p>Anyone thinking twice about it, JUST GO FOR IT!!&nbsp; </p><p>I wish I&#039;d done this weeks ago...</p><p>Now I am going to have to learn more about this -- if this stuff works so well, I think it would be good to use some of the more advanced features.</p><p>THANKS AGAIN!!</p><p>DD</p>									</div>
