Or how do I return it to its original state? It&#039;s a v3</p><p>I have two days trying to get back to the original state, but I can not or as they guide me to finish installing.

					<p>You do the scp while logged into your PC&#039;s DOS command prompt not the router&#039;s.&nbsp; So the scp command runs on your PC and pushes the file to the router.&nbsp; When you next log into the router the file will be there in its /tmp directory.</p><p>Also, I&#039;m not sure how the DOS scp works with path quoting, it would be best to change directory to your C:\ directory and run the command with just the file name.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 12 Apr 2017, 03:40)</p>
