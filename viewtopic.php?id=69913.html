					<p>Hi,</p><p>The documentation at:<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/dhcp">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/dhcp</a><br />says<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>100 is the offset from the network address, in the default configuration this would mean start leasing addresses from 192.168.1.100</p></blockquote></div><p>So, the default router ip is 192.168.1.1 so 100 offset would make 192.168.1.101 and I also see in my dhcp server status that the IP 100 is never assigned.</p><p>The same goes for the limit option, the 150 would end in 192.168.1.251 if it starts at .101.</p><p>Is this an error in the documentation?</p><p>Thanks,</p>									</div>

					<p>The router does not follow the rules with assigning IP addresses because it is the one doing it... The router is taking the ip 192.168.1.1 still.</p><p>The IP&#039;s it assigns to clients start at 100. It is more of a range than an offset. No the manual is not wrong, just worded weird. It is not really an offset. Just the starting range for IP assignments.</p><p>Basically, you can&#039;t just add 100 to the IP...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mys5droid</strong> on 20 Feb 2017, 04:53)</p>
