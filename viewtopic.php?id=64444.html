					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a Linksys EA3500 Router, Architecture Kirkwood, codename Audi.</p><p>I know I can get <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/kirkwood/generic/">Prebuilt Trunks</a>. However those are missing packages and I need to add them. I figured out how to add Luci on top of the Buid and get Luci Running. </p><p>However It seems to be not including PPPOE packages as well. Or so it seems. When I check interfaces, I do not have ability to add PPPOE interface. </p><p>A. What Packages are needed to enable this ? <br />B. If I want to make my own build with Luci and PPPOE, and flash it, Would such a package retain those 2 even if I do factory reset on the router ? Or would I have to reinstall the packages after factory reset ? </p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

I did read it. That&#039;s why I chose to make my own image with Luci and other packages baked in. The problem is that, Opkg update assumes you have Internet at that point. Such is not the case for me. This EA3500 serves as my modem/router on a FIOS Service. With this out, there is no Internet unless I rent one of their Routers.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>hnyman wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>If you build those packages into your firmware image, they will survive reset actions. </p><p>The &quot;factory reset&quot; in Openwrt means removing all changes made after the flash.
