					<p>The WLC_GET_RSSI ioctl call, with the above structure,&nbsp; does not seem to differentiate between MAC addresses when the router is in ad-hoc mode.&nbsp; Is there a way by which we can enable this, while maintaining the router ad-hoc?</p><p>Or, is there a way I can register for events with the Broadcom binary, to obtain notification on receipt of packets?
