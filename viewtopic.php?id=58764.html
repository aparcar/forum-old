					<p>I&#039;m trying to understand to some level the inner workings of OpenWrt. As I own Zyxel P2812HNU-F1 I will be reffering to <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/zyxel/p2812hnu-f1">wiki for this router</a>. </p><p>On my desktop Linux I can see that grub config has two entries: one specifying kernel file and another specifying initramfs file:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root (hd0,0)
kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.32-504.16.2.el6.x86_64 ...
initrd /boot/initramfs-2.6.32-504.16.2.el6.x86_64.img</code></pre></div><p>Wiki for P2812HNU-F1 says that during flashing process kernel file is uploaded into RAM memory:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>tftp 0x80800000 openwrt-lantiq-xrx200-P2812HNUF1-uImage</code></pre></div><p>then it is written to NAND:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>nand write 0x80800000 0x60000 0x200000</code></pre></div><p>then a separate file openwrt-lantiq-xrx200-P2812HNUF1-uImage-initramfs is loaded into RAM and run:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>tftpboot 0x80800000 openwrt-lantiq-xrx200-P2812HNUF1-uImage-initramfs
bootm 0x80800000</code></pre></div><p>1) my understanding is that this second file is -- by analogy with my linux desktop -- actual kernel + initramfs file, like two-in-one. is this correct?</p><p>2) only kernel file is written into NAND (openwrt-lantiq-xrx200-P2812HNUF1-uImage). so when next time the system boots up it is missing initramfs file (if my understanding is correct of course). is this so? does the kernel file (openwrt-lantiq-xrx200-P2812HNUF1-uImage) have everything it needs (compiled inside openwrt-lantiq-xrx200-P2812HNUF1-uImage) and doesn&#039;t require separate initramfs file?</p><p>I would appreciate your answer.</p><p>thank you,<br />geos</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>geos</strong> on 30 Jul 2015, 19:59)</p>

					<p>No, yhe initramfs means &quot;a file for start from ram&quot; in desktop with no space limit is the standard way, in tyny devices no. in this case &quot;uimage&quot; is a special file format to be started by uboot, and the initramfs is for start from ram, not from flash. useful if you want to delete, write ... flash.</p><p>and yes, the flashed kernel dont use initramfs,.</p>									</div>
