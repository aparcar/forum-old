					<p>When you flashed the original firmware over openwrt -- did you flash a boot version of it or did you cut the boot section out of the file? I just read an article on wiki that newer TP-Link routers require you to cut a piece of the original firmware (if it has a word boot in the filename) before flashing it over openwrt.</p>									</div>

Can I then flash the firmware with the boot in the name or once I go OpenWRT I&#039;m forever stuck with needing to remove first part of the file before flashing?</p><p>PS. I don&#039;t remember wiki explaining *why* you need to cut a section out of the stock firmware if anyone could explain that in detail I&#039;d be much obliged.</p>									</div>

					<p>The important detail is the environment you are flashing <strong>from</strong>. When flashing a stock firmware <strong>from</strong> OpenWrt, you need to cut out the bootloader. When flashing a stock firmware <strong>from</strong> a stock firmware, you can flash the file as is (unless TP-Link tells you something different, which in that case is their responsibility). So if you want to update the bootloader, first return from OpenWrt to stock with a cut firmware, then flash the firmware with bootloader from the stock interface.</p><p>OpenWrt generally does not recommend writing to the bootloader, this is why you can&#039;t (easily) flash a bootloader update. What exactly happens when you flash a boot-firmware with mtd I don&#039;t know, but it probably writes the bootloader part of the firmware file to the firmware partition, and thus pushes the kernel and data out of position, and on next boot the bootloader can&#039;t find a kernel to load.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makro</strong> on 30 Nov 2014, 19:33)</p>
