					<p>Hi guys I repost this on hardware hacking section becouse I hope that someone help me:</p><p>---------------<br />Hi I&#039;m Dario from Italy. I found your post very interesting, and I&#039;d like to flash kamikaze on my wag54g version 2...&nbsp; I&nbsp; decided to build the serial connection but I found some problems...I follow your pinouts settings but I believe that doesn&#039;t go with my wag ... first I try to connect it using an old cell connection cable, I&#039;ve open It and I had found that the chip was a MAXIM686E (I&nbsp; remember)...it was perfect for building the serial connection...first I have check using the schema of the chip founded in the MAXIM website, the chip has three inputs lines and two outputs first I have connected the first input line with the rx line of the router and the the first output line with tx of the router the I&#039;ve connectd the ground and the 3v line of the router with the respective ones on the chip...I&#039;ve tested it with minicom with standard settings 34000bauds 8N1 nothing seemd to happen...so I&nbsp; decided to connect all the three inputs and all the two outputs with the respective&nbsp; in the router using the pinouts you specified...at this point the router starts to smoke...and I disconnected all before it&#039;s breaking (so it seems)...the router still gone but the maxim chip probably is broken...so I&#039;ve taken an usb to serial converter (prolific) and I&#039;check on wikipedia the d-sub 9 pinouts I&#039;ve connectd the pin number 2 (RXd) with the TX of the router and the 3 with the RX of the router the the pin number 5 with the ground of the router...something seems to happen infact minicom with settings 9600 8N1 starts to display strange characters...but nothing human readable...at this point I&nbsp; stop my tests...I&nbsp; dont&#039; build the usefull serial connection...but I analyze the work in progress of open wrt kamikaze AR7...I found that wireless doesn&#039;t support WPA and this is a very important feature that will lacks...<br />What I ask to U is:<br />- Are your pinouts correct? for my routers open wrt settings seems&nbsp; to be correct (4th pin tx 3td pin rx 2nd unused)<br />- How can I build a serial connection? I need full infos such as d-sub 9 pinouts...<br />- Is stil missing WPA in kamikaze?<br />- Can I use an open wrt router as an OpenVPN 24h 7d client?<br />-----------------------<br />I have just place a bid on an auction for an rs232 max232 converter:<br /><a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MEBIDX:IT&amp;item=250301691620">http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?Vi â€¦ 0301691620</a><br />How can i connect it to the router? do i have to connect the rx of the converter with the tx on the router board pinouts and the tx of the converter with the rx on the router board thanks<br />Dario</p>									</div>
