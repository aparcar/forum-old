					<p>I installed openwrt on my asus wl-500gP box in order to use it as a router, webserver, ftp server, samba server and torrent/http/ftp download box.<br />I installed lighttpd + php5 with sqlite support succesfully, the samba server is also running. But I want to use torrentflux-b4rt as a webinterface to control my torrents. Torrentflux-b4rt is installed and running fine.</p><p>Now here&#039;s the trouble: Torrentflux-b4rt needs a patched version of transmissioncli, the source is included in the tf-b4rt package. Now I have to compile the source. I did it once on the oleg firmware before, but with openwrt I can&#039;t seem to find a package which contains a C compiler, or the automake tool.</p><p>Does anyone know how to compile the transmissioncli source on the router?</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve been trying to figure out how to cross-compile this thing for hours now and it still doesn&#039;t start to make any sense....</p><p>Isn&#039;t there anyone on the forum here who has experience doing this job who can do this for me in 2 minutes? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>edit: wohoo! I cross-compiled a working transmissioncli! The Openwrt SDK exited with some errors, but I pulled out the transmissioncli and put it in /usr/sbin by hand. If people want I can build an ipk package for this software, just let me know and I will try to fix the last errors.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wouzs</strong> on 1 Nov 2007, 02:12)</p>
