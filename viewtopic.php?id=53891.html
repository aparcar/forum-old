					<p>Hello everyone,<br /> Iam trying to create adhoc network on tp link wr 1043ND router since i want to create a mesh network. When i change the wireless mode to adhoc and interface as lan on router then i cant access router web page even though i have bridged lan interface to wireless network. So is there a way to create adhoc so that i can access router using wireless as well wired.</p><p>Thank you in advance</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pramod.j94</strong> on 9 Nov 2014, 13:25)</p>

					<p>Bridging is not supported in adhoc mode.&nbsp; That explains your loss of connection. If you want to use adhoc mode you will have to route instead.&nbsp; One way is to deactivate the WAN port and move the wireless to the WAN zone.&nbsp; That will allow you to connect via wireless or a via any one of the wired LAN ports.</p><p>Another option is to use 802.11s open source mesh standard.&nbsp; It supports bridging.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ad-hoc was designed to connect multiple wireless clients without any provision to connect to other interfaces.&nbsp; In otherwords, you can only connect to an adhoc interface via another ad-hoc wireless client or by routing to a different network.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>uvray313</strong> on 10 Nov 2014, 04:27)</p>

					<p>Starting from default, change your LAN interface from a bridge to a single interface with eth0. That will make the router wired only.</p><p>If you then want to create a mesh network with adhoc, change your WAN interface from eth1 to ad-hoc wireless with a private static IP of say for example. 10.61.0.1. Do the same with each router using 10.61.0.2 and then 3 etc...</p><p>If you then want to connect your mesh network to the internet, configure one router with the LAN interface configured to adhoc wireless and the WAN interface connected to the internet.</p><p>Bottom line, if you try to bridge ad-hoc wireless to another interface it will stop working.&nbsp; You have to use routing to connect to and from your ad-hoc network with any other interface. That is the purpose of configuring it as either the WAN or LAN interface with the other network configured for the remaining.</p>									</div>
