					<p>Transmit power level limits are complicated, but I believe that maximum power in 5.2 GHz range (channels 36 to 48 IIRC) is 23 dBm, including antenna gain. So if your wireless card assumes a 6 dBi antenna (pretty typical) then the transmit power limit is 17 dBm. Likewise the limit for the 2.4 GHz band is 20 dBm, so if your card assumes 5 dBi antenna gain, then the Tx limit is 15 dBm.<br />I hope someone will correct me if I&#039;m wrong.</p><p>The other comments regarding your 40 MHz attempt are spot on.</p>									</div>

					<p>15 and 17 dBm are the hardware limits for your Buffalo router. It probably has a power amplifier which the driver does not know about, which makes the real transmit power higher.</p><p>Using 2.4 GHz and 40 MHz in an environment like that is pretty idiotic. You don&#039;t get any improvement in the transfer speeds due to interference, and the transmit power is spread into a twice as wide a bandwidth, giving you 3 dB lower SNR.</p>									</div>

					<p>snk is right, with 30+ 2.4Ghz networks in your area, the only sure solution to get more bandwidth is to move to 5 GHz.</p><p>You could try directional antennas. If you are handy, you can build a few &#039;biquad&#039; ones fairly easily. Use on both ends for maximum effectiveness, but it can still help if used only on the base station.</p><p>Another thing you can try is to switch to horizontal polarization instead of vertical. This literally means folding your (typical dipole) antennas so that they are horizontal rather than vertical. You must do this on both ends for maximum effectiveness since the polarization must match for good signal transfer. Make sure the antennas do not point at the other end; the other end should &quot;see&quot; the side of the antenna, not the tip. If you are using a laptop on the other end, it is probably using an internal patch antenna and you can&#039;t do anything to change the polarization. But you can still try this out; it may reduce interference from other base stations (since almost everyone uses vertical antennas). This may not be effective since every time a signal bounces off of a surface, its polarization can change, depending on the angle of the surface.</p>									</div>
