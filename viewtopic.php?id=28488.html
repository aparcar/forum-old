					<p>It also says:&nbsp; Kamikaze trunk r17250 &amp; later&nbsp; &nbsp;We have r25000. BUT newer versions could indeed only be supported by newer firmware, or not yet at all. Which version do you have?</p><p>Yes, our wiki needs more maintenance... I guess after somebody here in the forum has helped you with your problem, you won&#039;t bother to mend the wiki?</p><p>You can look for packages here (for the ar71xx Target):<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/packages/Packages">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … s/Packages</a></p><p>Search the Web (google) or the Wiki for Howtos.</p>									</div>

As a OpenWrt (not Linux) BEGINNER, do:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/beginner">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/beginner</a></p><p>You know your device, that&#039;s dandy, but you - most probably - need it&#039;s Hardware Version, as well! Because sometime, the manufacturer changes so many things, that a newer Version may not work properly (or at all) with an OpenWrt-version the elder Version work with!</p><p>Proceed with downloading vanilla (the precompiled firmware-files offered at the downloads-page, &quot;I&quot; call them vanilla) and installing it.</p><p>A really good wikipage (no, you could not possibly know this), is here:&nbsp; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd</a></p><p>It done according to:&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/meta/template_device">http://wiki.openwrt.org/meta/template_device</a></p><p>Many other articles are not written according to the template, and sometimes they are not really helpful. <span class="bbu">Sorry for that, but I am not going to change this!!!!</span> As you might guess, I own an WR1043ND, so I chipped in info to that wikipage (and backported good Ideas to the template). I have no idea what new &quot;hardware version&quot;s come out, so that Info <strong>has to be</strong> put in by other users, like YOU. (Yes, sometime this is a pain in the ass, because some devices have up to four different Version Naming Tags. Which one represents Hardware Changes?)</p><p>The Wiki:<br />If anybody who posted his problem in the forum (and got help) would go back to the Wiki to the insert the missing information, that would be really really nice. You dont need to write new articles, just chip in the missing stuff. Stuff that made <em>you</em> come to the forum in the first place. Like which &quot;Hardware Version&quot;s of Device xxx are supported...</p><p>If then some (very few) people decided to contribute even more content to the Wiki, like diverse HowTos, yes, that is even more appreciated. To save yourself some redundant work, you should start here:&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/meta/start">http://wiki.openwrt.org/meta/start</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;you can edit the meta, too.<br />Then look in the inbox, or directly in&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/start">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/start</a></p><p>The Wiki should help,<br />beginners<br />advanced users<br />developers (mainly: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/start#developing)">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/start#developing)</a><br />gardeners (wiki-maintainers) (mainly: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/meta/start)">http://wiki.openwrt.org/meta/start)</a></p><p>The idea is not necessarily that you waste your time writing howtos to repay a debt to the &quot;community&quot;(=other guys offering you the fruits of their work for free), but more that you have a problem, solve your problem (help in the forum...!) and then decide to provide a wiki-page, a howto, describing your solution. (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/meta/templates">http://wiki.openwrt.org/meta/templates</a>) So that in the future, people can get this done [b[fast[/b].</p><p>Especially if someone with a lot of expertise bothers to help you in the forum, you most probably could port some Info into the wiki.</p><p>As OpenWrt has undergone some MAJOR changes, we have oldwiki and new-wiki (nuwiki). I am sorry for that, but the contents in the oldwiki became quite antiquated and thus obsolete. However, this won&#039;t happen again. Such major changes, that all the work done in the wiki will become antiquated, will not happen again. I expect howtos like <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/cifs.server">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/cifs.server</a> to be around for a long time. That&#039;s an hour of work for an article that will be there for the next couple of years, providing help to thousands of users. Is the gain worth the effort? I think so.</p>									</div>
