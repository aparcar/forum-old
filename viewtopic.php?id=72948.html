					<p>I would like to setup my pi3 as AP.&nbsp; Once that is done, my thought is to connect it to my son&#039;s xbox and let him connect to our network.&nbsp; Plus it&#039;s self powered and can service his room.&nbsp; Any thoughs?<br />RC</p>									</div>

					<p>Using RPI3 as a wireless AP that is connected by Ethernet to an upstream device, or as a wireless repeater extending another wireless network doesn&#039;t really use the RPI3&#039;s full potential. I would consider doing so only if I had an extra RPI3 around with no better use.</p><p>If I was buying a new device, I&#039;d consider a dedicated repeater device instead. RPI3 has good hardware, but it lacks a built-in 5 GHz band, and the antenna is quite puny.</p>									</div>

					<p>I second Antek, Raspberry Pi is both over- and underkill for the task. Over in a sense, that you won&#039;t utilise the Pi&#039;s power and capabilities, under because it has no chipset and antennae designed for the tasks of a dedicated wireless router.</p>									</div>
