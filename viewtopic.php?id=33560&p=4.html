Manually set your computer IP address to 192.168.1.2<br/>4. plug in the router while holding the reset button on the back of the router. Keep the reset button pressed until Power LED starts blinking slowly. This puts the router in recovery mode, which is necessary to flash using the Asus Firmware Restoration utility. If you try using the restoration utility and the router is not in recovery mode or is not connected it will say, &quot;No wireless device in recovery mode is found&quot;<br/>5. run Firmware Restoration Utility which you installed in step 2.

					<p>Have you tried using your usb audo device without installing any further modules? The trx I provided already have kmod-usb-audio compiled in kernel. And that is the reason why you get the error when you try to install from repository. (you cannot install over this module since the kernel option was not to compile as a MODULE). I beive I also included kmod-usb-cm109 in the kernel. So if your sound card uses these drivers it may work out of the box. </p><p>Telnet to router and see the modules listed in /lib/modules/3.0.18.1/ </p><div class="quotebox"><cite>grayman4hire wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Hello,<br/>I was able to installed LuCI with the above source, but cannot install kmod-usb-audio.

					<p>mpillaius, yes I did try plugging in my usb audio device (its the cheapy &#039;3D Sound&#039; $1.50 type shipped from China, which works on my WL-520Gu). It didn&#039;t light up and I didn&#039;t see anything in dmesg that it got detected properly (compared to dmesg on my WL-520gu). I&#039;ll double check tonight.</p><p>Here is the content of my /lib/modules/3.0.18.1<br/></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/lib/modules/3.0.18# ls
