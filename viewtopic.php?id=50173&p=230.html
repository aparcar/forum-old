Your laptop also has to send its signal *back to the router*. Since there&#039;s no corresponding boost of the laptop transmitter, its signal may not be strong enough when it reaches the router.

An antenna has &quot;high gain&quot; because a) it sends its electrical energy more efficiently into the airwaves, and b) because it &quot;collects&quot; more of the signal from the airwaves to create an electrical signal to go to the receiver. The extreme examples of this are the Pringles cantenna&#039;s, or using a discarded satellite dish for long-range wifi. (The googles is your friend.)</p><p>Using a high gain antenna can help your router to hear your laptop &quot;better&quot;, thus giving you better range.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>richbhanover</strong> on 19 Jun 2015, 20:21)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m not sure of how much improvement you&#039;re going to get by buying so called &quot;high gain&quot; antenna. The stock antenna are already optimized at 100% wavelength with a optimized dispersion pattern. The best thing one can do to increase range is to add height to the antenna (or get walls out of the way). Many so called high gain antenna, just add height, and hence increase range by design. </p><p>There are some omni antennas that do a better job of dispersing the radiation pattern and radiation angle, but I&#039;m not sure how much &#039;gain&#039; one would expect for antenna that could be used for many different purposes.</p><p>Supposedly, the Linksys 1900 has &quot;Beamform&quot; technology that allows the antenna to direct RF energy into a direction -- If this is true, then that&#039;s going to be &#039;gain&#039; over a regular omnidirection antenna. Without knowing the details of how this works, it just sounds like a sales &quot;Gimmick&quot;. </p><p>Wasn&#039;t going to say this, but as a FCC license holder, with antenna experience, I&#039;m skeptical. Not to say, 3rd party high gain antennas don&#039;t work because they do depending on the application. </p><p>Best Regards,</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davidc502</strong> on 19 Jun 2015, 20:42)</p>

Your laptop also has to send its signal *back to the router*. Since there&#039;s no corresponding boost of the laptop transmitter, its signal may not be strong enough when it reaches the router. (There are stunts that happen with MIMO and other sexy technologies to extend the range, but they all will run into this fundamental law of physics - each receiver needs to be able to hear the other transmitter.)</p><p>However, high gain antennas can help here. An antenna has &quot;high gain&quot; because a) it sends its electrical energy more efficiently into the airwaves, and b) because it &quot;collects&quot; more of the signal from the airwaves to create an electrical signal to go to the receiver. The extreme examples of this are the Pringles cantenna&#039;s, or using a discarded satellite dish for long-range wifi. (The googles is your friend.)</p><p>Using a high gain antenna can help your router to hear your laptop &quot;better&quot;, thus giving you better range.</p></blockquote></div><p>Thanks, I forgot to mention the other end of the equation.&nbsp; Another good example of richbhanover&#039;s point is MU-MIMO... MU-MIMO routers exist, but there&#039;s not a single consumer client device that&#039;s MU-MIMO on the market, thereby rending the technology, at least until MU-MIMO clients get release this year, useless.&nbsp; Another example is the 160mHz band width, available under WiFi options, as the chipset doesnt, at least currently, support it.</p><p>Whereas with laptops and PCs its quite easy to upgrade your WiFi card, that&#039;s not the case with smartphones (and possibly tablets if they&#039;re using an integrated card vs a mini-pcie.</p>									</div>
