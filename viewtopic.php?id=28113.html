					<p>Dear all, </p><p>I flashed WRT160NL with latest backfire image with an ath9k driver. </p><p>I set the router as an AP, and one laptop as client.&nbsp; &nbsp;I ran iperf UDP test from AP to the laptop.&nbsp; They are placed pretty close to each other, and the throughput performance is not very good, around 20Mbps.&nbsp; </p><p>I did the same experiment with the factory firmware, the UDP throughput is a little higher, around 24Mbps. </p><p>Anyone has some experience on ath9k performance at this moment?&nbsp; I came across this ticket <br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/6165">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/6165</a>,&nbsp; back then there seemed to be some performance issue with ath9k</p><p>thanks a lot in advance!</p><p>jt</p>									</div>
