					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have the following setup at my organization:</p><ul><li><p>Outbound Internet access given by a corporate router that only our provider can configure (all I can do is power cycle it).</p></li><li><p>Several switches to connect Ethernet-based workstations to the router.</p></li><li><p>Four OpenWrt dumb wireless APs configured as per <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap"><span class="bbu">this</span></a> guide, one connected directly to the router, the others with the aforementioned switches in between.</p></li></ul><p>The router delivers addresses in the 10.20.30.0/24 range. I have configured the access points&#039; LAN interface to use 192.168.99.0/24 in order to completely avoid collisions. Whenever I need to access LuCI or SSH, I change my workstation&#039;s IP to 192.168.99.123/24, do my work, then switch back to DHCP.</p><p>That works very well. But my question is, is it possible to somehow have access to the APs <em>without having to change subnets</em>, i.e. reach 192.168.99.0/24 from my 10.20.30.0/24 address? While OpenWrt is very stable for this task and requires zero maintenance, I also have MAC filtering enabled so that only authorized employees may connect (I am aware this can be easily worked around, but in practice it has been very effective), and the whitelists must be updated regularly. Having to change to the other subnet regularly is cumbersome, and renders my workstation with no Internet access until I finish the task.</p><p>I only control them from a single computer, so solutions like static IP routes or ARP mappings, if that&#039;s involved, are acceptable. I know the best approach would be put another OpenWrt device or a Linux server between the APs and the router and centralize all filtering there, but that&#039;s a no-go at the moment.</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>

					<p>Bumping this. It&#039;s probably a pretty easy task, but these access points are already wall-mounted, so having to take them down to enter failsafe mode and such would be a hindrance.</p>									</div>

					<p>I thought of that, but I need to be completely sure there won&#039;t be any collisions with the main network. If one of the APs is ever down or rebooting, and the router&#039;s DHCP assigns its usual address to someone else in the meantime, then it would become unreachable.</p><p>It&#039;s also a bit more secure if the LuCI and SSH are isolated from the rest of the network and only respond to 192.168.99.0/24 (but that&#039;s not the only security measure in place, of course).</p>									</div>

You get zero connectivity if you connect anything else to the fiber converter, MAC cloning and all. I would guess they use SNMP or similar to make sure only their equipment can get online.</p><p>Putting an OpenWrt router between the provider&#039;s and the rest of the network is the second best choice, and one I&#039;m highly looking forward to. For various reasons, it&#039;s not a short-term goal, but it could be done some months from now. Centralizing all filtering on a single device would solve the problem at hand, create less further work, and give me more control over the network. Our provider is already using carrier-grade NAT and none of our services needs to be reachable from the global Internet anyway, so port forwarding wouldn&#039;t be a problem.</p><p>In the meantime, your second suggestion sounds pretty good. We have approximately 40 Ethernet workstations, plus a couple dozen wireless clients connected at any given time, so high addresses like 10.20.30.251-254 are probably very unlikely to be assigned. I&#039;ll check it next week.</p>									</div>
