					<p>Just a small grumble that may or may not have any resonance with anyone out there.<br />I am trying to hack the Makefile for php5 package but am finding it impossible to figure out what the hell&#039;s going on. The design of the Makefiles seem to have made them as concise as possible, at the expense of completeness - the result seems to be an abstract implementation that&#039;s very hard to hack.</p><p>For example, how do I specify the CPPFLAGS argument if there are no explicit build commands for the base package? Also, it seems that PKG_CONFIGURE_OPTS is automagically passed to the configure directive - but how is anyone&#039;s guess....grrrr.</p><p>I guess it&#039;s the old discourse between maintainability and automation. Have let off steam now, comments welcome.</p>									</div>

					<p>check the parts that say &quot;define Build/Compile/php5...&quot;<br />These contain all the commands that are run for the compile step.<br />If you want to pass the CPPFLAGS argument to make, why don&#039;t you just look for the $(MAKE) invocation in that instance and add it there? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>&quot;why don&#039;t you just look for the $(MAKE) invocation in that instance and add it there?&quot;</p><p>That&#039;s&nbsp; part of the problem - it is missing for Build/Compile/php5, and I assume it&#039;s defaulted somewhere in the depths of include/package.mk<br />This typifies the problem I&#039;ve come up against, the fact that hidden default methods might not always be the best strategy. I hope this is fair criticism, please correct me if you think otherwise.</p>									</div>
