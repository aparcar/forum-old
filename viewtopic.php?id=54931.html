					<p>I&#039;m looking for a compact travel router capable of running OpenWrt and I ran across this one on Amazon:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PNJRDT4/ref=gno_cart_title_1?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A2QM69FCS5U6SD">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PNJ … 69FCS5U6SD</a></p><p>The thing that interested me most is that this little router is supposed to come with 16mb flash, while all the other compact routers I&#039;ve seen come with 4mb or 8mb.&nbsp; The image shows an AR9331 chipset. It also comes with a version of OpenWrt installed, according to the vendor, and it can be flashed to dd-wrt as well.</p><p>It looks very interesting.&nbsp; Here is the description on Amazon:<br />Support your DIY in many aspects, enjoy your achievements </p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>1. You can install openwrt or dd-wrt packages on this smart router. With 16MB flash you have more than 8MB free space to install your packages; </p><p>2. With UBOOT failsafe you can burn your own packages without hesitate, you can recover the box to original state any time. </p><p>3. Interfaces </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1*USB </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1*micro USB </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1*100M WAN </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1*100M LAN </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1*reset </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;On board hardware interfaces for your DIY: </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A UART port; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Five GPIO interfaces; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A Serial port; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3.3V and 5V power output; </p><p>4. Smallest smart router, with 2.3in*2.3in*0.87in dimension, it is easy to install this box / board to your own device and control the device remotely.</p></blockquote></div><p>The gotcha here is that this thing is only available on Amazon and there are zero reviews, so far.&nbsp; Does anybody have any knowledge or thoughts about this thing?&nbsp; The Amazon listing has an image of the board, so maybe somebody who knows more about hardware than I do could take a look at it and comment.</p>									</div>

					<p>Is there a &quot;clean&quot; non-customized OpenWRT image that works with either the TBMax and/or the gl.inet ? I love little devices like these that run OpenWRT for tucking away into networks for remote access and diagnostics. I&#039;ve used TP-Link MR3020&#039;s very successfully in this role but have needed to add USB storage since the MR3020&#039;s only have 4MB internal flash. Would be nice to get it all into a single box like this if possible. Plus I like having two wired ports and not just the one port of the MR3020. Thoughts? Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Nevermind. I didn&#039;t find it referenced directly in the Table of Hardware but I found the gl-inet listed in the barrier_breaker ar71xx downloads so I&#039;ll assume that covers it. <br />-- <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-gl-inet-v1-squashfs-factory.bin">https://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_b … actory.bin</a></p><p>bizmail, did you ever confirm whether the tbmax is in fact identical and works with the gl-inet image?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>knetknight</strong> on 24 Apr 2015, 19:52)</p>

					<p>I got the gl.inet router and I kept the installed customized openwrt firmware.&nbsp; I had to tweak it a little to fix some issues, but overall, it&#039;s a perfect travel router.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t try the tbmax router, so I don&#039;t know how compatible they are.&nbsp; I would recommend the gl.inet.&nbsp; Also, the manufacturer is very responsive to questions.&nbsp; It&#039;s a device made by hackers for hackers.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, I realized afterwards that you had said you&#039;d probably just get the gl.inet so I did the same thing and have one on the way! Looks like a great device.</p><p>What version of OpenWRT is the preloaded version based upon? And can it install add&#039;l packages straight from the regular OpenWRT repositories? I&#039;ll probably reflash it to vanilla bb anyway so I know I have the latest and so i know it&#039;s standard and pristine, but I do really love the specs on this over the MR3020&#039;s that have otherwise served me very well.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t remember the version.&nbsp; I think they&#039;ll show it on their website.&nbsp; You can definitely download and install regular packages from the OpenWRT repositories.&nbsp; I asked about making some changes to their proprietary GUI and got a reply saying that they will probably make the GUI open source soon, so you might want to correspond with them about that.&nbsp; I would recommend that you try using their GUI a bit before you flash a different version.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I got my GL.inet 6416A today. I was very pleased to see the default firmware was 14.07 based, /etc/banner shows:<br />&quot;BARRIER BREAKER (14.07, r42853)&quot;</p><p> I like the device itself&nbsp; and love that it is inherently and deliberately OpenWrt and DIY friendly. I played around with the default firmware enough to know that I don&#039;t like it. I just couldn&#039;t see that it added any real value so I&#039;ll try to sysupgrade it to vanilla OpenWrt later tonight.</p>									</div>

					<p>Simple as could be. I just flashed the current 14.07 &quot;openwrt-ar71xx-generic-gl-inet-v1-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin&quot; through the web UI, making sure to UNcheck &quot;keep settings&quot;, and about 2 minutes later she was clean as a whistle with pure OpenWrt at defaults. I couldn&#039;t be much happier, loading it up now with my standard suite of tools!</p>									</div>
