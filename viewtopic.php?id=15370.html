					<p>I have connected a GPS to my WRT54GL 1.1, but have a strange problem with it.</p><p>Serial GPS modules are difficult to find (at a reasonable price) where I live, so I followed the instructions that I found at <a href="http://www.primianotucci.com/default.php?view=28">http://www.primianotucci.com/default.php?view=28</a> and turned a USB GPS to a serial one. As I wasn&#039;t sure whether this was going to work I bought the cheapest one (Navibe GM621 with Sony&#039;s CXD2951GA chipset)</p><p>It seems to run fine on 3.3V and I can get NMEA sentences to my WRT, but for some reason the GPS cannot get a fix, no matter how long I wait. According to the NMEA sentences it sees the satellites, but it doesn&#039;t even get the date information, it boots at date 010303 and just increments the time, one second at a time.</p><p>The device is working fine, if I solder it back to the USB cable it works just fine. It gets the date information immediately and gets a fix in less than a minute.</p><p>I even tried feeding it 5V using 12V from WRT and a regulator, but that doesn&#039;t help. I did lower the serial voltage from 5V to 3.3V using a zener in this case.</p><p>Anyone else seen this kind of problems? Could it be expecting some input before it really initializes / gets a fix? Something else I should connect or disconnect in the GPS?</p><p>TIA</p>									</div>

					<p>Why are you doing this?&nbsp; There are LOADS of serial interfaced GPS modules out there. Both of these sites look to ship internationally.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what you consider to be &quot;cheap&quot; but most of the models on that usglobalsat site of which sparkfun also caries a few look to sell for around $50 or less.</p><p><a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/categories.php?cPath=4_17">http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/catego … cPath=4_17</a><br /><a href="http://www.usglobalsat.com/c-43-engine-boards-modules.aspx">http://www.usglobalsat.com/c-43-engine- … dules.aspx</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the pointers. I don&#039;t have experience with these sites, many of the US sites that I have seen ship internationally only with FedEx / UPS and that makes the delivery usually very expensive. Additionally, local FedEx / UPS offices are eager to handle the customs stuff and charge me a handling fee for it. The final price could easily be over â‚¬100 ($160)</p><p>That&#039;s why I didn&#039;t go look for a GPS module at US sites.</p><p>I guess I&#039;ll try a module like that if I can&#039;t make the current one to work. Or then just solder the USB cable back and attach it to my WL-500gp, but I was hoping to use WRT for this, it already has an SD card attached.</p><p>I paid â‚¬30 (â‚¬50) for the USB GPS, I would have happily paid â‚¬50 ($80) for a serial GPS module that works with 3.3V.</p>									</div>

					<p>now I got a fix in serial mode. I used the USB connection, waited for a fix and connected it almost immediately with serial.</p><p>let&#039;s see if it works also tomorrow, having been without power for some hours.</p>									</div>

					<p>no, it wasn&#039;t actually a fix, it gave the last known location, but had &quot;invalid fix&quot; code in NMEA.</p><p>well, if I happen to get it working I&#039;ll let you know.</p>									</div>
