					<p>I have finally upgraded my WRT54GL device to Kamikaze 8.09RC2 (coming from White Russian) and tried to configure the device according to this repeater howto: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/Repeater">http://wiki.openwrt.org/Repeater</a><br />The client part works fine and I was also able to create an access point at the same time, but unfortunately I am unable to connect to it with any client. It is visible but when trying to associate with that AP the connection always times out.</p><p>These lines appear in the log on the client trying to connect to the AP:</p><p>wlan0: authenticate with AP 02:1a:70:a2:ba:1d<br />wlan0: authenticate with AP 02:1a:70:a2:ba:1d<br />wlan0: authenticate with AP 02:1a:70:a2:ba:1d<br />wlan0: authentication with AP 02:1a:70:a2:ba:1d timed out<br />wlan0: direct probe to AP 02:1a:70:a2:ba:1d try 1<br />wlan0 direct probe responded<br />wlan0: authenticate with AP 02:1a:70:a2:ba:1d<br />wlan0: authenticate with AP 02:1a:70:a2:ba:1d<br />wlan0: authenticate with AP 02:1a:70:a2:ba:1d<br />wlan0: authentication with AP 02:1a:70:a2:ba:1d timed out</p><p>It does not matter which encryption the AP uses. Even with no encryption at all the result is the same.<br />Is there anything I might have missed somehow?</p>									</div>

					<p>In the meantime I have played around with the settings a bit and as soon as I remove the virtual client interface, the access point immediately works as expected.

If so, is there a work-around available (e.g. manually configuring the interfaces?)?</p><p>Any help is very appeciated.<br />Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>I sucessfully tested at least multi-AP and WDS setups with brcm-2.4 on recent 8.09 branch revisions.</p><p>There are a couple of things to keep in mind:<br /> * NEVER add the wireless ifnames to the network config directly, it&#039;s not supported and when it does work it is pure luck. Use the &quot;option network&quot; directive instead<br /> * Broadcom VIFs don&#039;t handle unicast traffic properly if they are NOT within a bridge, symptoms are that dhcp works but ping not<br /> * OpenWrt versions prior to 8.09.1 had a bug in the VIF-MAC-assignement which prevented WPA from working<br /> * The standard configuration as suggested in the documentation worked for me with multi-AP, bridged client and WDS scenarios</p><p>Regards,<br />JoW</p>									</div>
