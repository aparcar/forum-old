					<p>thank you Squonk&nbsp; i presume you meant hexdump from your march 28th post.<br />I noticed my model gets little warm, could be this other way to tell models apart i mean if i have old model and new model does not get warm.<br />I saved like almost 50% energy bill by replacing two big linksys routers with wr703n!</p>									</div>

Everything works as expected (using trunk from 10/08 on the device), but I run into one problem: I want to reuse the reset button and can&#039;t get it to work. I followed the wiki-article about hardware-buttons, but openwrt keeps rebooting, once the reset buttons is pressed. I noticed that the /etc/hotplug2.rules file doesn&#039;t exist, but creating it doesn&#039;t change the behaviour.<br />This is what logread -f puts out, when the reset button is pressed:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>un Oct 12 15:24:16 2014 user.notice root: reset
