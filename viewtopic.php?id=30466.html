					<p>If you&#039;ve got a 100Mbps WAN connection I&#039;d save up and get an E4200 or one of the other high end routers currently out. A WNDR3700 might handle it too.</p>									</div>

					<p>ashrack, your posting is merely a hint. It does not contain information.</p><p>1. You can disable conntrack<br />2. there are a couple of buffers involved,&nbsp; which could be optimised, if they are not already at optimum...!<br />3. you can apply packet scheduling to one of the buffers</p>									</div>
