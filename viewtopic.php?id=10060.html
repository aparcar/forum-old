					<p>Ok.. Here is my setup and situtation:</p><p>* WRT54GL Using openwrt kamikaze from trunk as of &quot;March 23 2007&quot; running kernel version 2.4.34</p><p>The kernel module wl.o gets compiled with two kernel version specified</p><p>&nbsp; #strings /lib/modules/2.4.34/wl.o |grep version<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;wl%d: %s %s version %s<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;kernel_version=2.4.20<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;kernel_version=2.4.34<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;__module_kernel_version</p><p>I tried searching in the source code for any files where it might mention kernel_version=2.4.20&nbsp; but have not found any.&nbsp; I have no clue how the module keeps getting compiled with the wrong kernel version.&nbsp; The module loads and works fine if I force insmod to load it.&nbsp; </p><p>If anyone can help me troubleshoot why its doing that, or has had this issue before, and has found a solution, that would be great.&nbsp; </p><p>Also, I know there is very little information in regards to what configuration I used when I compiled openwrt, so if there is any extra information that is needed, please let me know and I will post it.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>William.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, here is an update.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t find the source for wl.o driver.&nbsp; Upon further testing I found that I could edit /etc/modlueles.d/30-brcm-wl and replace the &quot;wl&quot; line with &quot;-f wl&quot; .&nbsp; This forced insmod to load the module at start up ignoring the error about different kernel version.&nbsp; This was for a jffs2 image on WRT54GL.</p><p>I also tested a squashfs image on WRT54GL and found that the module loads correctly there with out errors or having to modify the &quot;30-brcm-wl&quot; file.&nbsp; The wl.o driver still has two kernel versions on it, but it still loads fine.</p><p>-W</p>									</div>
