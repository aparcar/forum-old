					<p>Before bricking my Asus WL500-W I would like to check if it is supported with the latest Barrier Breaker release?<br />The Asus has 32MB RAM, 8 MB Flash, and was apparently supported with the 12.09 Attitude Adjustment release.</p><p>Can any of you shed any light on this? I&#039;m very eager to start using OpenWRT because it looks awesome to me.</p>									</div>

					<p>I didn&#039;t. I once managed to resuscitate it (with a UART cable, from my own router) when I upgraded it to 12.09, but after a seemingly succesful flash to 14.07 it exhibited the same behaviour. I tried with Asus&#039;s own recovery tool (on Windows), the OpenWrt failsafe procedures, but no worky. Would have been too cumbersome to grab my own router again, open it up, and do the UART procedure all over again, so I decided to toss it. There&#039;s noone I can make happy with an old 802.11g device anyway over here.</p><p>The device was on its way out already, so OpenWrt&#039;s not to blame.</p><p>You should flash without LuCI because it&#039;s too heavy for this device (only 16 MB of RAM). It will make it dog slow. That goes for both AA and BB.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Borromini</strong> on 29 Nov 2014, 14:26)</p>

					<p>Sorry for the mixup... I thought Slicer was the OP and he said he had a WL-500G. But no, b43 and 802.11n is not a success.</p>									</div>
