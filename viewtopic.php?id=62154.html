					<p>Hello Community,</p><p>I’m struggling with the installation of openWRT on my Netgear DGN2200 via TFTP upload from a Minicom cmd on a TTL interface using an Ubuntu 14.04 32 bit machine.</p><p>I followed the steps for flashing the owrt firmeware on the <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/dgn2200">modem page</a>. I also found more information on <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=215661#p215661">UTI_BAIT’s post</a> on the forum.</p><p>The problem I’m having is to establish the coms between my computer via the USB to RS232/TTL converter and the modem. here’s where I’m upto;</p><p>- Almost certain that the board I have is a type 1 compared to the <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=255067#p255067">photos published</a> by JonJongx on this forum</p><p>- Tested the USB converter in a loop setup. Connected the the RX to the TX of the dongle. Started the serial TTL emulator, in this case using Minicom and set a byte. The test is successful if Minicom returns the character you type in. —&gt; It works</p><p>- Tested the USB RS232 to TTL converter with an Arduino DUE on Serial3 by following <a href="http://blog.startingelectronics.com/how-to-use-arduino-serial-ports/">this tutorial</a> with the difference that I set the Arduino sketch to initiate serial at 115200 8N1 and configure Minicom to the same. I could receive and send bytes with the Minicom/Arduino IDE serial to and from the Arduino DUE —&gt; It works, one could state that I can read and write serial msg.</p><p>- Soldered wires to J5 serial pins 1(GRD),2(RX) and 5(TX) from left to right with the wifi casing on the bottom as per detailed in the <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/dgn2200">VGN2200 openWRT page</a>. Tested the connections with a volt meter. (Pin 6 is Vcc) The readings were the following. GRD/Vcc = 3,3v | GRD/TX = 3,3v | GRD/RX = 3,3v. —&gt; Works, one could say the soldering is making proper contact.</p><p>- Connected the modem’s board to the USB converter, with respectively GRD USB to GRD board, TX USB to RX board, RX USB to TX board. Started the modem, waited. —&gt; No-Work. no messages are printed by the serial interface while booting.</p><p>With a bit of Googling it seems some are giving the serial pins [-][tx][n/a][n/a][rx][+] and some are giving [-][rx][n/a][n/a][tx][+]</p><p>- Alternatively connected the board to the USB serial converter inverting RX and TX, respectively GRD USB to GRD board, TX usb to TX board, RX usb to RX board. —&gt; No-Work. no messages are printed by the serial interface while booting.</p><p>I’m running out of ideas so hints, suggestions, comments, pizza, wine are very welcome.</p><p>Many Thanks,<br />alex</p>									</div>
