					<p>Yes I have, (on trunk) but that is only the unicode part of it I think. I need true locale support. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locale">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locale</a>). It can be done however, see <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/docs/buildroot-documentation.html.">http://downloads.openwrt.org/docs/build … tion.html.</a> Owncloud really needs it.

Maybe they should only strip things that can be added afterwards using opkg. A good example is tar.

					<p>Something to note from uClibc.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>uClibcFAQ wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Some of the space savings in uClibc is obtained at the cost of performance, and some is due to sacrificing features. Much of it comes from aggressive refactoring of code to eliminate redundancy. In regards to locale data, elimination of redundant data storage resulted in substantial space savings. The result is a libc that currently includes the features needed by nearly all applications and yet is considerably smaller than glibc. To compare &quot;apples to apples&quot;, if you take uClibc and compile in locale data for about 170 UTF-8 locales, then uClibc will take up about 570k. If you take glibc and add in locale data for the same 170 UTF-8 locales, you will need over 30MB!!!</p></blockquote></div>									</div>

					<p>I think this deserves some serious thought. Routers are improving all the time and getting faster. Before long they can run full Linux distributions. At present flash size is already irrelevant now that we have extroot. Is throwing out functionality to save a few kilobytes a smart thing to do? At least users should have the option to easily put back omitted features, don&#039;t you think?</p>									</div>

					<p>Alright, it makes sense. But I guess it <em>should</em> be possible to add locale support via a package. We have all kinds of kernel modifying packages, don&#039;t we? Just making an e.g. <strong>kmod-localesupport</strong> or something doesn&#039;t look <em>that</em> insurmountable compared to other things you can add to the kernel.</p>									</div>
