					<p>Hi, new to the forum but I have been using OpenWRT on a TP-link WDR3600 v1 for a year or so.</p><p>I am trying to optimise my config but I am confused about the HT40 option.</p><p>This page <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless</a> says to use HT40+ or - as an option and doesn&#039;t even list htmode=HT40 . But this is what is set if I use luci to manage it (luci doesn&#039;t offer + or - as an option, just &quot;HT40&quot;)</p><p>If I use uci and set it to HT40- or HT40+ then Luci shows the n mode as disabled and no clients are reported as connecting on 40mhz (I have set noscan=1 as well) if I set it to HT40 I think it is working but I can&#039;t work out what channel it&#039;s running on.</p><p>Is the option &quot;HT40&quot; new and if so how does it decide whether to go higher or lower than the primary channel ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wstallwood</strong> on 21 Jun 2015, 15:57)</p>

					<p>It has been ht40 without plus or minus since 14.07. I don&#039;t know how it figures out what channel to pick (the one below or above, as indicated by - or +) behind the scenes though...</p>									</div>
