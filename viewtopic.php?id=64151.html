					<p>Hi,</p><p>I know it was already discussed here but I had problems connecting to some wireless<br />networks. I am using raspberry pi B+ and stock image from openwrt.&nbsp; WAN is set to DHCP<br />mode, so I can bridge existing wireless network. The issue is that for some networks it works just<br />fine, and for some now IP is obtained. I see it is connected&nbsp; and DHCP request is send, but <br />IP is not assigned. It is only for some networks. Am I missing something obvious?</p><p>Thank you<br />Mikhail</p>									</div>
