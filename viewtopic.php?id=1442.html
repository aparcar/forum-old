					<p>Hello all,</p><p>among some tiny other issues I sometimes have the problem that when the router has been rebooted but my box has been on. The DNSMASQ DHCP server NAK&#039;s my workstations request:</p><p>See here:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>May  6 18:30:33 (none) kern.info dnsmasq[2257]: DHCPREQUEST(br0) 192.168.86.40 00:b0:d0:14:72:c5
May  6 18:30:33 (none) kern.info dnsmasq[2257]: DHCPNAK(br0) 192.168.86.40 00:b0:d0:14:72:c5 lease not found
May  6 18:30:40 (none) kern.info dnsmasq[2257]: DHCPDISCOVER(br0) 00:b0:d0:14:72:c5
May  6 18:30:40 (none) kern.info dnsmasq[2257]: DHCPOFFER(br0) 192.168.86.40 00:b0:d0:14:72:c5
May  6 18:30:40 (none) kern.info dnsmasq[2257]: DHCPREQUEST(br0) 192.168.86.40 00:b0:d0:14:72:c5
May  6 18:30:40 (none) kern.info dnsmasq[2257]: DHCPACK(br0) 192.168.86.40 00:b0:d0:14:72:c5 rembrandt</code></pre></div><p>The effect is that all my tcp sessions get cut off. Some seconds later DNSMASQ assigns my workstation the exact same ip which it had before (because it&#039;s in &quot;ethers&quot;).<br />Why can&#039;t dnsmasq simply ACK the first request (there&#039;s no lease in dhcp.leases but at least a fixed assignment...)</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>									</div>

					<p>dnsmasq seems to be one the slowest dhcp server I have ever met too. It also depends from your dhcp client, for instance, I use gentoo&#039;s dhcpd with -t 5, and everything is quite fast, I wait maybe 1 sec, and it&#039;s ok.</p><p>For your case, well, try other dhcp clients, and see whether it&#039;s better or not ? Maybe adding some dnsmasq options helps ?</p>									</div>

					<p>If you uncomment the &quot;dhcp-authorative&quot; line in dnsmasq.conf it should speed up the replies.<br />(not sure how to solve the nak issue)</p>									</div>
