					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m running Openwrt Backfire 10.03.1 on two WNDR-37000v2.</p><p>I have two 3G Modems (ZTE-652 (contract) and D-Link DWM-156 (prepaid) as backup).</p><p>Both are working properly after I&#039;ve figure out how to get them running:&nbsp; <br />D-Link: <a href="http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch/bb/viewtopic.php?t=817">http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswit … .php?t=817</a><br />ZTE: <a href="http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch/bb/viewtopic.php?t=810">http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswit … .php?t=810</a></p><p>I&#039;ve got a very strange behavior now:</p><p>After a few weeks with no problems (some usb-modem hangups, but nothing big - reboot fixed them).</p><p>The speed of both modems decreased by more than 50% - without any previous signs...</p><p>I&#039;ve reinstalled openwrt - freshly configured them (without using a backup/restore) but the speed still was verrrry slow (1-2 MBit/s)</p><p>Full of desperation I&#039;ve connected my ZTE-652 to my &quot;old&quot; Netgear WNDR-3000 (which I got, when I&#039;ve signed the contract with my provider) - and the speed was up to 5-7 MBit/s.</p><br /><p>Honestly I absolutly don&#039;t understand why this is/was happening.</p><br /><p>The only idea I&#039;ve got is the line i&#039;ve added in /etc/hotplug.d/usb/20-modeswitch</p><p>D-Link: echo &quot;07d1 7e11&quot; &gt; /sys/bus/usb-serial/drivers/option1/new_id<br />(Also mentioned in the links above)</p><p>Can this cause some sort of &quot;overload&quot; if this command is started every time the usb-device is connected?</p><p>I love openwrt because i can do what I want and not what the designer of some crappy firmware wanted (or not) - so I would really like to keep openwrt as my gateway to the world wide web...</p><p>Thank you for your support - you&#039;re doing a really great job!</p>									</div>
