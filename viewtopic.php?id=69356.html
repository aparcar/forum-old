					<p>Hi!</p><p>I am trying to use a brand new TP-Link TL-WR841N/ND v11 as an Access Point using the &quot;Dumb AP&quot; Guide [As I new member I do not seem to be able to post links] (via LUCI).</p><p>The &quot;dumb switch&quot; part of it is working fine, I am able to use all the LAN ports as expected. I&#039;ve got the wifi setup the same way I have on my other routers / APs. However, devices connected to the wifi are not able to connect to the internet. My two IOS devices state &quot;Keine Internetverbindung&quot; (&quot;No Internet Connection&quot;).</p><p>Has anyone got a clue what might be wrong?</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Model    TP-Link TL-WR841N/ND v11
Firmware Version    OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 r49208 / LuCI for-15.05 branch (git-16.090.31416-605d1f1)
Kernel Version    3.18.29</code></pre></div><p>i.imgur.com/F3vGOAY.png</p><p>i.imgur.com/FP5IbhO.png</p><p>[Again, not being able to insert links, pls copy+paste]</p><p>I seem to remember having similar issues on a TP-Link WR1043N v1 running DD-WRT, which was why I switched back to stock firmware on that device. Am I missing something or is this a bit tricky with TP-Link devices?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>It seems, devices trying to use the wifi are not getting an IP address. Why are they not able to get one? On the AP, I have disabled DHCP as that role is taken by my router.</p>									</div>

Should I move it inside?</p><p>As I said above, at the moment it is working, after I disabled the DHCP Authoritative on the Dumb AP. I guess that was the problem.</p>									</div>
