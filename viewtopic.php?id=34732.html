					<p>Since I can&#039;t write to the Tp-link factory image for MR11U (I wanted to disable hotplug script that runs the handle_card command) and debug..&nbsp; I think Openwrt is the only way to go at this point, but there is no wiki for MR11u, I only found these 4 bin files below, can anyone explain what they are?</p><p>thanks</p><p><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/</a></p><br /><p>openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-mr11u-v1-jffs2-factory.bin<br />openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-mr11u-v1-jffs2-sysupgrade.bin</p><p>openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-mr11u-v1-squashfs-factory.bin<br />openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-mr11u-v1-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin</p><p>Based on this<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Sysupgrade.bin is for any router that is currently running either<br />openwrt or gargoyle and can be flashed via the GUI.</p><p>The factory.bin files are meant to be flashed over factory stock<br />firmware routers - they usually have some extra &quot;magic bytes&quot;<br />i.e. a trick header - to fool the factory firmware into thinking its<br />reading its own factory firmware, not 3rd party firmware.</p></blockquote></div><p>I think I will use factory.bin, now jffs or squashfs...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kocoman</strong> on 14 Feb 2012, 19:07)</p>
