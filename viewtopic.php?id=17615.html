					<p>Hey there again,</p><p>error was on my side - I stand corrected: System boots up to prompt, but of course there&#039;s no module for my usb-keyboard... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />(Had to term over serial to find that out...) </p><p>Which brings me to something that I could not resolve on my own: If I try to install the respective module (kmod usb hid), opkg keeps telling me that there is some unresolveable dependency to a package called &#039;core input&#039; which I cannot find anywhere in the repository. <br />Could somebody please point me to the right package ?&nbsp; </p><p>Moreover, I experienced great instability when running kismet_server and kismet_client: kismet_server starts up and reports some packets but brings my ALIX3d3 to reboot&nbsp; after at most 1 minute of package-sniffing. Similar with kismet_client - pressing Shift-Q does not only quit the application but leads to crash.<br />Is the version in the repository known to be that unreliable ? Did anybody experience the same ?</p><p>Thanks for some swift answers !</p>									</div>

					<p>Similar issue here.&nbsp; Trying to get openwrt to boot on an alix3d3 with no luck.&nbsp; Tried SVN sources from trunk and followed directions at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/AlixPort">http://wiki.openwrt.org/AlixPort</a> to the letter.&nbsp; System hangs as soon as grub tries to load.&nbsp; I never get to the kernel selection portion of grub, just the initial console message.&nbsp; Tried 7.09 also to no avail.&nbsp; Thanks in advance for your help!</p>									</div>
