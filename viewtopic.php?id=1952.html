					<p>Hello!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;m using a WRT54GL v1.1 with RC6 and have encountered a problem that sounds similar to the previous [old/ignored] posts - and I believe in recycling.</p><p>I screwed-up firewall.user, so pwr-cycled and pressed reset (after DMZ LED came on.)&nbsp; Next boot, the router started showing a LAN-side MAC address of 00-00-00-00-00-00 - like this, ping and telnet don&#039;t work, however, if I press reset while booting (after DMZ LED comes on) the router will show a non-zero MAC address and ping and telnet work!</p><p>During all this I&#039;ve tftp&#039;d a new RC6 bin, and run &quot;firstboot&quot; - MAC address always shows 00-00-00-00-00-00 after boot.&nbsp; It seems some exceptional/unusual action is needed - assuming it&#039;s possible to get the router out of this state.</p><p>Any ideas(AKA: &quot;charity&quot;) would be appreciated!</p><p>Cheers!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>booboo</strong> on 3 Jul 2007, 23:05)</p>
