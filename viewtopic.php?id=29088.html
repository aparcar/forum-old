Adding the correct VLAN tagging depends on wether the WAN port has its own physical ethernet interface (like on the WNDR3700) or is just a vlan tagged virtual interface (like on most broadcom devices, or this TP-Link).</p>									</div>

To accomplish this you should create another Vlan statement for Vlan 8 and include port 0 as trunk (0t) once again like the statement for Vlan 7.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;switch_vlan&#039;

					<p>I just want to mention, that the SPEEDPORT 221 VDSL-Modem (by Deutsche Telekom, manufactured by Sphairon) detects untagged PPPoE packets and automatically adds the required VLAN ID7 as a fall-back solution. But take care, as this does not work with IPTV which needs VLAN ID8.<br />I did not test it yet - my vdsl line will be connecte in 6 weeks :-(</p>									</div>

					<p>How can i configure this on a device where WAN is an other interface and not a VLAN in the LAN? I tried enable switching and vlan, but it cant enable switch(i dont think thats needed). I tried renaming the interface from eth1 to eth1.8 just to get that for test working but it dont worked. The internet connection just worked and the iptv doesnt (normal internet cant work here on this isp with vlan8).</p><p>The device is an Butffalo ag300</p>									</div>

To accomplish this you should create another Vlan statement for Vlan 8 and include port 0 as trunk (0t) once again like the statement for Vlan 7.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;switch_vlan&#039;
