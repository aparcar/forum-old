					<p>Whay you mean by kick ?<br />If its wireless you can kick it with &quot;hostapd_cli disassociate&quot; but nothing will stop it from reconnecting again. Adding or removing mac restriction requires hostapd restart which will also kick everybody else.<br />May be its possible to use radius authentication and do something with radius to temporary block account but its complicated.<br />If its wired and sit on a switch then nothing can stop it from accessing network. If switch is managed then its possible to temporary disable the port it sit on. <br />I think the most reasonable approach would be blocking access to critical network resources with iptables. this way its easy to block access to internet on gateway, but impossible to block access for a wired device to the same LAN segment because traffic does not go thru router&#039;s CPU.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bolvan</strong> on 5 Apr 2016, 15:31)</p>

					<p>Thank you for your reply bolvan.</p><p>What I want to achieve is to kick the device from one AP&#039;s wireless network so it can connect to another AP&#039;s wireless network, which is better. There for I cannot block the device from parts of the network, I need to block in totally.</p><p>I will look into &quot;hostapd_cli disassociate&quot; and see if it satisfies my needs.</p>									</div>
