					<p>I&#039;m using an NSLU2 for a project that requires pairing my Google Nexus One (running Cyanogenmod 7.1) with my NSLU2, which has a Bluetooth dongle attached.</p><p>Bluetooth seems to be working fine:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# hcitool scan

After trying to pair from my phone, Android waits a couple of seconds before throwing back an unable to pair error. From OpenWRT, I see no apparent way to pair the devices, as hctitool cc and hcitool auth don&#039;t seem to do anything. Anyone know the exact process for pairing devices?</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m putting together compact wardriving setup with an NSLU2 running OpenWRT. WiFi and Kismet are both working, but I don&#039;t own a standalone GPS for location data. I&#039;m going to use my phone to provide the NMEA data, but unfortunately I can only do this over Bluetooth, not USB. It would also be very handy to use SSH over Bluetooth so I can leave my Ethernet cable in the laptop bag.</p><p>So have you successfully paired your Treo with your OpenWRT device, so I think you are a step ahead of me. Been a while since I&#039;ve seen a WinMo device!</p>									</div>
