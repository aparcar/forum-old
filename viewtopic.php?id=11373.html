					<p>Hi, </p><p>thanks for advise, but still it doesn&#039;t work, the description seems to be right, the DMZ led is blinking but it doesn&#039;t take the file, I get timeout. I think it stops/crashes before the firmware can bring up the interfaces.</p><p>Is there a chance to make a serial cable and then see what&#039;s happening, I&#039;ve seen that there&#039;s a way to make a cable, but will it help me, will I get a console, especially is there any option to disable loading drivers or failsave or anything I can do????</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
