					<p>Hello!<br />I have some problem with my Tp-Link WR941ND. A few days ago i flashed openwrt instead dd-wrt. Because of my mistake in settings i had to run failsafe mode, but i failed. I couldn&#039;t ping or tracert 192.168.1.1. Then i found this report (<a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/10436">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/10436</a>).<br />So, the question is: i&#039;ve also cought one&#039;s foot on this problem? And now i must try to flash my router via serial port?</p>									</div>
