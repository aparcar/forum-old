					<p>Hello,</p><p>I would like to get DVB USB card IT9135 working with my router TL-WDR3600. I have installed the newest trunk firmware (Bleeding Edge, 50104) on it, the extroot on USB flash drive is working and tvheadend is successfully installed too - the web GUI is accessible and working.</p><p>But when I connect the IT9135 card into the second USB slot on this router, command &quot;dmesg | grep usb&quot; says only this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>usb 1-1.2: new high-speed USB device number 4 using ehci-platform</code></pre></div><p>I have already searched and walked through dozens of threads and posts, but I haven&#039;t found any complete tutorial saying how to achieve what I want.</p><p>I know I have to propably compile proper kernel modules (.ko files) for this build and this kernel version (4.4.14), and move them to the /lib/modules/4.4.14 directory + load them with modprobe command.<br />I have already found list of needed modules for this USB card: dvb-core, dvb-pll, rc-core, tuner-it913x, it913x-fe, dvb-usb, dvb_usb_v2 and dvb-usb-it913x. I tried to use these .ko files available online, but as they had been compiled for another kernel version they could not be loaded - modprobe threw errors.</p><p>I have absolutely no experience with compiling the kernel modules or programs for OpenWRT, so I don&#039;t know how to start.<br />Should I follow this simple tutorial: gargoyle-router.com/old-openwrt-coding.html - use SDK from the trunk repository? Or should I git clone openwrt how another resources advise to?</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes you will need to build yourself. So start by installing the buildroot on your PC and make sure you can build a firmware that runs on your router.</p><p>Then you would add the third-party package source codes to your build system, and build them in.</p><p><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/packages">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/packages</a><br />Scroll down to the part about kernel packages.</p>									</div>

					<p>Could you please offer a little more help? Tutorials on the OpenWRT wiki are not so easy to understand... (it would be great if somebody created a simple step-by-step tutorial)</p><p>My questions are:<br />1. How can I make sure that my PC can build that firmware running on my router? I thought it is sure thing when I use the latest trunk firmware it can be also compiled.<br />2. I have set up latest Debian x64 in VirtualBox and installed everything as written in wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence . But I don&#039;t know what I should change in menuconfig if I only want to compile the kernel modules for IT9135, it is not said clearly on the wiki.<br />3. Can I use codes for the DVB drivers I found on github here: github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/drivers/media/dvb-core ? Is it that easy that I download these folders on this repo to some compilation folder, compile it and done? Or have I to write some code first? I really don&#039;t understand how it works.</p><p>Thank you very much for help.</p>									</div>
