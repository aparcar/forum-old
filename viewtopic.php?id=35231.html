					<p>The Buffalo WZR-HP-AG300H is not a modem. This is the router I bought for my home network. Here&#039;s my experience:</p><p>1) I used the tftp method to upload the initial openwrt firmware, using an intermediate switch. (trunk r30556) Once I started using the correct .bin file I didn&#039;t have much issue uploading. (The tftp method worked roughly ~10-15% of attempts, so you have to try a bunch of times.) My unit had dd-wrt when I bought it, but I&#039;m not sure if it originally shipped that way as it was an open box special at Fry&#039;s.<br />2) I had some initial issue with the radio when I had a) both radios on and b) WPA with TKIP. Wife&#039;s iPhone and our galaxy tab had terrible connections (looked like the connections might have been resetting themselves.) I turned off the 5GHz radio, switched to AES with WPA/WPA2 blend on radio 0, and turned the 5GHz radio back on with WPA2/AES and that seemed to fix everything.<br />3) I don&#039;t have any issue getting good signal strength around my house as others have reported. I generally get in the range of 60-80 Mb/s net throughput over wireless.<br />4) Using LuCI on this device is very responsive, presumably due to the able CPU. The flash and RAM are extremely ample, and even now I&#039;m only using a small portion of these.</p><p>Personally I&#039;d recommend this device, with the possible exception that I haven&#039;t actually tested if I&#039;m getting the proper full TX power out of this device. I was comparing this one to more expensive alternatives and I&#039;m happy with my choice. YMMV</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zoiks</strong> on 5 Mar 2012, 21:01)</p>

					<p>The WZR-HP-AG300H is good. There is also the Netgear WNDR3800 which shares the same internals but with less flash memory. WNDR3700 v1 or v2 works too but have less RAM. If you want something cheaper there is the single-band TP-Link TL-WR1043ND.</p>									</div>

					<p>I generally get around 70Mbps over wireless. 2.4GHz covers my house pretty well, but I haven&#039;t thoroughly tested 5GHz.</p><p>TX Power:<br />Radio 0(2.4GHz): Set via Luci to max 27dBm, LuCI reports TX power at 19dBm<br />Radio 1(5GHz): Set via LuCi to max 17dBm, LuCI reports TX power at 13dBm</p><p>I am not using 40MHz modes. I have to wonder if I&#039;m getting &quot;high power&quot; out of this &quot;high power&quot; router. I&#039;ll have to do some more checking tonight.</p>									</div>
