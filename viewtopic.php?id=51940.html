To address this, we decided to do a fresh start<br />on GitHub. The new feed <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/packages">https://github.com/openwrt/packages</a> should be<br />used from now on and package maintainers are asked to move their<br />packages there. For the final release we will still build the old<br />packages feed but it will be necessary to enable it manually in the<br />opkg package list to be usable.</p><p>Additionally we would like to give a big thank you to all of our package<br />maintainers working on our various feeds.</p><br /><p>New build servers<br />We would like to express our gratitude to Imagination Technology for<br />funding the 2 build servers that we used for the release.</p><br /><p>Whats next ?<br />We aim at releasing Chaos Calmer (CC) before the end of the year. The<br />CC release will use 3.14 or a newer LTS kernel as baseline.</p><br /><br /><p>Have fun!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The OpenWrt developer team</p>									</div>
