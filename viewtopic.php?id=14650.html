					<p>I was looking for a simple solution to redirect a few sites that my son likes to visit instead of doing his homework.&nbsp; I was hoping that I&#039;d be able to just insert a few entries into /etc/hosts to accomplish this, but this isn&#039;t having any effect.</p><p>My etc/hosts file currently looks like this:</p><p>127.0.0.1 localhost OpenWrt<br />192.168.1.9 fanfiction.net</p><p>No DNS entry is set on the client side, so all DNS requests should be handled by OpenWRT.&nbsp; I&#039;m assuming I&#039;m missing something basic here, but I haven&#039;t done anything like this before, so I&#039;m stumped for now.</p>									</div>
