					<p>Guys, this is all great, but has no major impact on the performance of typical router functions, which largely do not make use of floating point operations. While this may improve performance of public key cryptography, due to the fact that PKI is only used to authenticate end points and/or perform the handshake for a symmetric encryption key, which is from then on used to encrypt data passing through the transport, you would hardly even notice anything in a real world usage scenario.</p><p>Also, that thread is probably a better place to put all this compiler optimization stuff: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=42062&amp;action=new">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … action=new</a></p>									</div>
