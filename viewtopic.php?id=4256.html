					<p>I would like to run all the network traffic of one of my wr850&#039;s into a PC setup<br />with ethreal/snort for IDS. Is it possible to make a monitor port via the switch,<br />or make a hub out of the switch? Rather not use it as a hub but if that is the only<br />way so be it.</p><p>Egg</p>									</div>

					<p>Better brands of switches will implement something like a SPAN port. This is where that port sees all traffic on the network. Useful for network monitors of all sorts.</p>									</div>
