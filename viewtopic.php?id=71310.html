					<p>Hey there.</p><p>Are you sure what you&#039;re trying to do is possible at all?<br />If you really want to &quot;bypass the NAT&quot;, you need to wire your PS4 directly to the WAN port. This means: It needs to get a unique IP address from your ISP. And this only works if your ISP provides you with more than one IP. Which most ISPs don&#039;t do.</p><p>If you&#039;re sure: Off we go.</p><p>Open the wireless configuration section of your OpenWRT router.<br />Add a new wireless interface. Pick an SSID that is distinct from the one you already have.<br />At the &quot;Network&quot; part, check the box of your WAN port.<br />No connect your PS4 to the new SSID.</p><p>But once again: I doubt that will work, because I really doubt your ISP gives you more than one IP address.</p><p>[edit]</p><p>Ah. And that has *nothing* to do with DMZ.<br />And the usual DMZ configuration does *not* bypass NAT.</p><p>So overall one must ask: What for?</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>golialive</strong> on 23 Jun 2017, 13:56)</p>
