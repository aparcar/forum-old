					<p>I&#039;m probably going to make a mistake or two.</p><p>1. The ADSL devices that I know of are the AR7 family.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if you can play with VLANs on the switch port.&nbsp; If you can, you&#039;d set up one for machines with public addresses, and one for machines with private addresses.&nbsp; ISPs who offer multiple public IPs usually give you a bridged connection.&nbsp; If so, you need to bridge the public IP vlan to the atm device.&nbsp; Once you to that, those machines will get IPs.&nbsp; If you can&#039;t play with VLANs, you need to do some packet filtering tricks so those machine&#039;s DHCP requests are sent to the internet, but blocked locally.&nbsp; For the NAT machines, you would accept the DHCP requests locally, but block ALL their traffic on the bridge interface.</p><p>Routing is the easy part.</p><p>2. Should be doable.</p><p>3. Easy</p><p>4. The sloppy way I can think of to do this is use a modified version of wireshark, but I&#039;m sure there are better ways.&nbsp; The hard part is the monitoring; the rest is a shell script.</p><p>All of this is possible, but it&#039;s all easier said than done.</p>									</div>

					<p>Many thanks for your info this is appreciated.</p><p>The only thing that is stumping me is the hardware - ideally we would want to furnish people with one combined unit (adsl modem/router) - this is the bit I am stuck on.</p>									</div>
