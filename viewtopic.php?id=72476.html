					<p>Hello everyone:</p><p>Long time reading you guys, but first post ever.</p><p>I have a GL-inet AR150 with latest distribution. I have configured it as PseudoBridge using relayd as described in the relayd configuration page. (can&#039;t post links yet) It is working pretty well, besides some issues that I&#039;ll comment in another post.</p><p>The problem I have is that once I configured it and restarted, I can no longer SSH to the repeater, neither via its IP as client when connected to the master AP (192.168.10.2) , neither via ethernet cable at LAN port (192.168.1.1) . Both cases I get connection refused error.</p><p>I have LuCI installed, and I can access to it via the to above described methods, but can not log in using the console.</p><p>I have created a dropbear instance at port 22, over any interface, and opened port 22 at the firewall for both wan and lan zones, with no luck. </p><p>I&#039;m sure it has to be something related to the firewall configuration, which is exactly the same as the one in the relayd configuration page.</p><p>Can please somebody enlighten me?</p><p>Many thanks in advance,</p><p>Raúl</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;d first ask you to think about do you even need or want a firewall on a strictly internal router. Do you need to protect yourself from yourself?</p><p>If yes, then check your forwarding rules since luci works you aren&#039;t blocking everything.</p><p>I put my bridge in the same zone as the lan and am done with it.</p>									</div>

					<p>it is good to hear it works after fresh install. Sometimes the issue happened on laptop side because the IP address changed between sub net and static/dynamic.</p><p>For the ARP, it is not an issue. ARP cache is not refreshed frequently and realtime. If you want to know the latest, for specific IP/MAC, use ping. After ping you will see arp cache get refreshed. <br />Or, try arp-scan.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>raulgotor wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>@ximibaba, Did this, but it didn&#039;t helped.
