					<p>Hi, I tried to upgrade the firmware, and have tried two version of keeping my config files. The problem is that config wokring from 8.09 RC1 are no guarantee that is works for 8.09. Sometimes there are small fixes in config files that get lost and causes trouble. I have noticed this both with the mtu_fix and with &quot;overlay_root /jffs&quot;. </p><p>Could someone advice me on how to make sure that I don&#039;t overwrite any needed config by restoring by own settings after the upgrade ?</p><p>/Selepo</p>									</div>
