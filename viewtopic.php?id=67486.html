					<p>I found this RT5350F board in a NoName IP camera (it could be the same manufacturer who makes the wansview ip <br />cameras) .<br />The camera has the generic chinese design (see pictures)</p><p>Its 38pin (19 on each side) and hard soldered on the board.<br />It has 32MB RAM and 8MB Flash, same specs as many other rt5350 based modules.<br />Currently i&#039;ve got the NixCore X1 firmware running on it, it seems quite happy although the board pinout is completly different, but it has the same specs.</p><p>I identified pin 37 to be gpio0, i could measure out vcc and gnd pins, but it wouldnt help much i guess.<br />I did a search on google images btw. Had a quick look at alibaba, etc but couldn&#039;t find the exact module.</p><p>pic of module: h.t.t.p.s:././.drive.google.com/file/d/0B-XyaP4vMWWMQ2wtbDRBOXA2NEE/view</p><p>generic camera design: h.t.t.p.:././.w.w.w.cctvnetwork.in/administrator/uploaded_files/1381300831IP-camera-white.jpg</p><p>(forum rules won&#039;t let me post links)</p>									</div>
