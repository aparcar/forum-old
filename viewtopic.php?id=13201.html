					<p>this question goes on to people who have successfully booted up whr-hp-ag108.</p><p>I am svn update-ing trunk daily (if this is the wrong branch then are there any other branches I should be looking at?)</p><p>I am not getting any response from the router afer a flash. Tried squashfs, jffs2-64k and 128k, lzma and gz kernels, but they all &quot;sort of&quot; boot and then hang.</p><p>Is there anything to look out for in make menuconfig when building images for whr-hp-ag108? I have followed meshers instructions on flashing and all went smoothly (albeit, I only have 0x280000 free space for root) but I can never get it up and running for some reason or other and I don&#039;t have a serial console to be able to tell what&#039;s going on.</p><p>I just need to either get some directions on building images for this router (kernel config, image config, I know about ap30, done that but we&#039;re not even getting to that right now) or for someone to point me to working images.</p><p>it is very frustrating as all I want is to get adhoc (and possibly ahdemo) modes working and it seems they are broken on dd-wrt. I have 3 of these and they are just sitting there being wasted...</p><p>I know, I&#039;ve read the forum rules and that&#039;s why I&#039;ve said for someone to help me build images for this thing if you cannot point me or send working binaries.</p><p>Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>posix</strong> on 30 Oct 2007, 12:39)</p>

					<p>Problem sorted by downloading kamikaze7.09 instead of trunk (sorry!).</p><p>Anyway, whr-hp-ag108 working like a charm!</p><p>What about txpower settings for the wireless though? I&#039;ve only got up to 12dbm but this thing should be able to go way higher than that (hp with buit-in amp etc). Any ideas on that?</p>									</div>
