					<p>I wonder if anoyone has tried this before, as I can&#039;t find the specific setup in here or in the wiki, and available packages lack features, but ...</p><p>Benefits:<br /> * Obsoletes dumb port forwarding on firewall.<br /> * Allows unlimited web host-names on standard ports 80 and 443 on single public IPv4 address.<br /> * Easy to extend.<br /> * Allows clean dualstack IP based virtual host configuration on internal web servers.<br /> * Allows all of the above also on multiple internal devices.</p><p>Requirements:<br /> * Should receive all external IPv4 HTTP/HTTPS connections.<br /> * Should forward to internal IPv4 and IPv6 HTTP/HTTPS servers.<br /> * Should be able to forward according to host-name.<br /> * Should have SNI support to be able to forward SSL/TLS connections to appropriate hosts.</p><p>Remarks:<br /> * Not needed for IPv6 connections.<br /> * No need for caching on router.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>spoofy</strong> on 5 Feb 2013, 10:03)</p>

					<p>Hi,<br />have you solved your issue ?</p><p>I would like also to have in OpenWrt and easy way (uhttpd and maybe Luci) to configure a basic reverse proxy handling SNIs</p><p>Could be nice a simple configuration table with a list of SNIs associated to other hostnames:ports</p><br /><p>I know I could handles using nginx in place of uhttpd, but maybe it&#039;s not well integrated with Luci and maybe that memory footprint is much bigger.</p><p>Thank you<br />Fabio</p>									</div>

					<p>At that time I tried to install several http servers and proxies, all where lacking modules or functions needed. I got back to running Nginx on a internal server (old laptop) and doing it all from there. Most of it described here: <a href="https://roll.urown.net/">https://roll.urown.net/</a><br />I still like the idea, but would need a custom packaged proxy for OpenWrt.<br />Doesnt have to be Nginx. Something as <a href="https://tinyproxy.github.io/">Tinyproxy</a>.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi spoofy<br />i install OpenWrt Designated Driver r49006 in my router now. I read page <a href="https://roll.urown.net/router/smtp_mta.html#id18">https://roll.urown.net/router/smtp_mta.html#id18</a> at portforward, I insert some lines<br />config redirect<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option target &#039;DNAT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option src &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option dest &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;tcp&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option src_dport &#039;443&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option dest_port &#039;443&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option name &#039;HTTPS&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option dest_ip &#039;192.168.1.196&#039;&nbsp; # IP of my PC<br />test canyouseeme.org so port 443 <strong>open</strong>. But I add some lines:<br />config redirect<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option target &#039;DNAT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option src &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option dest &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;tcp&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option src_dport &#039;80&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option dest_port &#039;80&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option name &#039;HTTP&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option dest_ip &#039;192.168.1.196&#039;<br />and check again port 80 <strong>close</strong>. I replace with other port and check, the result is all port close and only port 443 is <strong>open</strong>. <br />Can you tel me how to open other port?<br />thanks you.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dktn</strong> on 15 Mar 2016, 17:23)</p>
