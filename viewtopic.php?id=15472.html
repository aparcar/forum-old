					<p>ok i figured out that the problem is the psk encryption on ath0. if i configure /etc/wireless not to do any encryption bridging works fine.<br />as openwrt is able to set up a bridge between eth0 and ath0 with ath0 running with psk encryption i bet the order in that the devices (bridge ath0) are configured is important.<br />if anyone has a better idea please let me know.</p>									</div>

					<p>ok i finally got this working.<br />as far as i understand the problem is that the tkip key renewal in bridges is problematic.<br />therfore hostapd has to be aware of the bridge.<br />what i did is the following:</p><p>remove all &quot;config wifi-iface&quot; configuration from /etc/config/wireless<br />make a script that is run on boot doing the following:<br />(i&#039;m using ip from the iproute2 package (ipkg install ip))</p><p>brctl addbr br0<br />ip link set br0 up<br />brctl addif br0 eth0<br />wlanconfig ath0 create wlandev wifi0 wlanmode ap<br />hostapd -B /etc/wificonfig/hostapd-ath0.conf</p><p>that&#039;s it.<br />before running the commands create the file /etc/wificonfig/hostapd-ath0.conf with the following content:<br />driver=madwifi<br />interface=ath0<br />bridge=br0<br />ssid=OpenWrt<br />debug=0<br />wpa=1<br />wpa_pairwise=TKIP<br />wpa_passphrase=secret<br />------<br />the bridge=br0 line is the line causing me the problems</p>									</div>
