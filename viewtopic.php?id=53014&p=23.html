(but seems to have removed) ... <br />he basically said you can use the entire ALL.bin to re-flash the entire ROM area, or use a separate part of the other files on that USB stick to flash a specific area of the ROM.</p><p>If I remember one of your questions though...<br />...you originally wanted to have OpenWRT act as a bridge.</p><p>I&#039;ve done that with one of my 3 TM02&#039;s already, and I was able to have it bridge my home router to the TM02 wirelessly, and connect that 1st one to my other TM02 thru it&#039;s Ethernet port so my 2nd TM02 can be a WiFi Web Camera, and my iPad can connect to it and still have internet thru the first TM02 and see the camera from the 2nd TM02</p><p>Each TM02 is on it&#039;s own different channel, so no slowing of the speed because it&#039;s using the same channel...like with just one TM02 trying to bridge.&nbsp; (2 separate radios are in use)</p><p>So it&#039;s still possible with the OpenWRT to do it.</p><p>I was going to also make a VPN server at home, and use my 3rd TM02 to be a bridge from a wireless hotspot outside, using OpenVPN Client to connect to my home VPN server, to have private home internet connections from a public wireless hotspot.</p><p>And I was going to make a new enclosure to hold the two TM02 and the external battery.</p><p>But life got in my way...:) and it was on hold for a while.</p><p>I ultimately was trying to create an iOS tool (App) to remotely, wirelessly, adjust the configs, and backup / restore working configs AND even the entire ROM chip contents, to be able to easily and quickly re-set the TM02 (or any other portable router using OpenWRT) so it can be configured much easier than what we&#039;re going thru now ...!&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Imagine being able to select from a list, what you wanted to make the router become, and with a few clicks of keys or buttons, bring back a working config, from a bad setting choice, or mix and match several configs to have the router act like mine does, and go back to stock the same way...anytime you needed to, just by selecting a choice from a series of menus.</p><p>It would put OpenWRT &quot;on-the-map&quot; with total ease of adjustability and backup/restore capabilities, to never have a bricked router ever again.<br />And to have ability to switch configs, or test a new config without worry of killing the working settings and destroying your days or weeks of work to get it set correctly.</p><p>That&#039;s what&#039;s killing OpenWRT...it&#039;s too damn hard to adjust, and it gets hard to reset back to a working configuration again.</p><p>I&#039;ve had to start from square one with manually reloading packages and setting configs, after I made a wrong setting with the seemingly simplest thing, and it&#039;s all gone...aaaahhhh...!</p><p>So I know how you feel.<br />Anyway...enough of my ramblings.</p><p>You seem to know more than I did with SSH and TFTP...etc...I think you&#039;ll be fine.</p><p>RangerZ and I were discussing my original idea, but I got sidetracked.<br />I hope to get back into it soon, because the iOS configuring and backup tool for OpenWRT routers is really needed. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>HooTooJunkie</strong> on 12 Jul 2016, 06:00)</p>

(192.168.1.1)</p><p>Then it reminded me of where I left off with this from last year or so.&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>But it really does work fully sometimes, ...where all is forwarding, so I didn&#039;t know what I may have needed to change, to test if it&#039;s the firewall, or one of the routers needing to have auto IP config turned off or reset someway ...or something else, completely not expected ...I don&#039;t know for sure.</p><p>...I can feel it&#039;s a simple thing I&#039;m missing, only because it sometimes connects perfectly without me resetting anything in any config, but rather just rebooting either one of the TM02&#039;s when both are using the Ethernet cable between them.</p><p>I&#039;m just scared to change anything yet as a trial and error thing... without being able to restore the original settings and any or all packages, separately, on each separately fully working Nano.</p><p>It&#039;s already happened before (the need to re-do the entire nano with OpenWRT) ...and I don&#039;t look forward to needing to reset both separately otherwise working TM02&#039;s again <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> ...but I&#039;d also like to connect both to each other, so I can use this method to bridge with my home VPN Server, and this TM02 combo as the outside hotspot bridge to my 3rd TM02 and private wifi network made to be a VPN Client, for my iPad.</p><p>Any ideas on what may be holding back the two TM02&#039;s from always working together, when Ethernet connected to each other?<br />Would you like to see the few screen captures I did get, of the router / hotspot bridging TM02?</p><p>By the way...when you say...<br />&quot;...<em>I get a little bubble in the lower right with a message about something trying to open a window</em>....&quot;</p><p>That&#039;s maybe the new login window, ...some requester to allow opening it....or an explanation of an error.<br />Didn&#039;t you ever open it, or wonder if it was the special login window attempting to open? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>HooTooJunkie</strong> on 13 Jul 2016, 09:28)</p>
