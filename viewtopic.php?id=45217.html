					<p>First of all, here&#039;s what I&#039;m running: <br />Router Name&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenWrt<br />Router Model&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TP-LINK TL-WDR3600/4300/4310</p><p>Firmware Version&nbsp; OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment 12.09 /LuCI 0.11.1 Release (0.11.1)<br />Kernel Version&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3.3.8</p><br /><p>I recently decided to try OpenWRT on my TP-Link TL-WDR3600 after much deliberation. I was overwhelmed a bit finding instructions and struggling with terminology, but to my surprise, LuCI came with the latest stable Attitude Adjustment build. My first task was getting dual band working correctly so I could see that my laptop&#039;s wireless network adapter was showing 300mbps consistently, which is why I bought the router in the first place since my FiOS router is not dual band.&nbsp; I had to set both radio&#039;s on the router to 40mhz 2nd channel above (whatever that means). </p><p>This allowed me to reach my FiOS capped download speeds over wifi on speedtest.net (50mbps down though i&#039;ve been getting around 52) and allowed me to consistently get about 15mbps upload though my cap is 25. Another reason I wanted to get this new router is to reduce ping. I researched online and it seems possible to reduce it with a superior aftermarket router vs what Verizon supplies.&nbsp; Speedtest and pingtest.net both report my ping around 20~22 and I&#039;ve seen others online reduce it from there.&nbsp; However, pingtest cannot complete the packet loss test for some reason. (Thoughts?)</p><p>My current setup is a FiOS box in the basement, a coax from there to my Actiontec Revision I router, a 1ft CAT6 cable from the Actiontec to the TP-Link. I turned off WiFi on the Actiontec. I set my SSID on both TP-link radios exactly the same with the same password too.</p><p>I&#039;d like some help with settings and reducing ping, but any other optimizations in settings for either would be great. I set my gateway for the OpenWRT to 192.168.0.1 so it doesn&#039;t conflict with my Actiontec. My biggest use of the internet is online gaming so ping is very important for me.</p><p>Hope someone can help me, I&#039;m not the best at networking so I would appreciate any explanation of terminology I haven&#039;t dealt with much and simplified explanations if possible, thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Ping is just a measure of speed and loss between 2 points. If you are in say USA and you ping a host in Russia you will get very different result to pinging a server in the same city as you.<br />The only thing you can change is the connection from your computer to your modem.<br />So, try pinging the various boxes in your setup. See where in the chain the loss is occuring (my bet would be WiFi - an easy test would be to connect your computer to the TP-link via ethernet).<br />20-22 is pretty reasonable to a distant host. But losses can be reduced to zero by finding where the losses happen in the chain.</p>									</div>

					<p>Correct. I&#039;ve 200/30mbps fibre and &lt;5ms ping, but that&#039;s what I can achieve in CZ, EU ping is around 20ms and speed 50-100mbps, but when I want to go offshore like to the usa, I can get 250ms and the speed only 10mbps, depending on location, some USA servers give me 50mbps and better ping, but that really depends on location.</p>									</div>

					<p>People talk about &quot;ping&quot; but they actually refer to is: <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_%28engineering%29">Latency</a></strong>.</p><p>The latency of any connection between Point A (=your PC) and Point B (=some other PC somewhere) depends on the path the packets take. Packets can and do traverse different paths! It depends on the number of <strong>hops</strong> in that paths, how quick packets are switched/routed on each individual hop and also, whether the buffers are full or not.</p><p>Besides Latency there is Latency variation, or Jitter. Also called ping jump.</p><p>To see the number of hops between your PC and the other host try:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>traceroute google.jp</code></pre></div><p> </p><p>You&#039;ll see, that your router/routers each represent one hop.<br />You will also see, that the delay is very low, thus there is nothing to tune.</p><p>In case you wanted to upload files (for file sharing) and at the same use VoIP or play an online shooter, you would definitely profit from <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/packet.scheduler/packet.scheduler">Configuring your Linux Packet Scheduler</a></p>									</div>
