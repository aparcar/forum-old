					<p>Dear all,</p><p>I hope somebody can help and put me on the right track. Trying to add support for new device, Comtrend VR-3022eu. Generally following this guide: openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/adding_new_device</p><p>I have serial access to device. I collected some data from OEM image - it has BCM6368B2 chip. I also managed to compile generic image using Broadcom reference board BCM96368WMGN. I created iniramfs image and successfully booted it via TFTP. Now trying to create device specific image. Created / updated following file:</p><p>target/linux/brcm63xx/base-files/etc/diag.sh<br />target/linux/brcm63xx/base-files/etc/uci-defaults/09_fix_crc<br />target/linux/brcm63xx/base-files/etc/board.d/02_network<br />target/linux/brcm63xx/base-files/lib/brcm63xx.sh<br />target/linux/brcm63xx/image/bcm63xx.mk<br />target/linux/brcm63xx/dts/vr-3022eu.dts</p><p>and also issued touch target/linux/*/Makefile. Doing make menuconfig I can see my new device and I can compile image. But booting from this image I&#039;m getting Kernel panic saying that board was not found.</p><p>Can somebody be so kind and give me some hint what I&#039;m missing ?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p><p>Radek</p>									</div>
