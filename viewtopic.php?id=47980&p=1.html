					<p>Hello,</p><p>@FriedZombie: thank you for your website feedback, we will work on our email settings as soon as possible. The 3.3V is quite strict, but we have succesfully run the board on 3.5V also. For optimal working of the module I would advice to use a simple LDO after your adapter. We are working on some reference designs. We expect the first batch of these modules this week, maybe the week after that. </p><p>@elppaapp: the WiFi module used is 2.4GHz and uses WiFi g/n</p><p>@pepe2k: I know these modules can be found on several chinese trading sites. But they are always sold in lots of 2 or more pieces. We are the only shop offering this module per piece and we will feature this module in various tutorials and good technical documents based on testing in our electronics workshop. </p><p>Kind regards,<br/>Daan</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>Low stock quantities is company policy, we can have new stock withing a few days. We are busy working on a very cheap development board but with many capabilities. Because of optimization we could lower the price to only €24,95 including VAT and only €3,5 international shipping. This makes it just a little bit cheaper than the Carambola 2. </p><p>We really like the OpenWRT community and are busy with setting up our git repository.

					<p>Hello,</p><p>You are absolutly right that without the development board it is less attractive. But we plan to release our development board within one month from now without making the price much higher. Software support will be released at the same time. The product now is a little cheaper that Carambola 2 and for early adopters. </p><p>As our company embraces hardware enthusiasts we will always answer and work with you to reach your project goals and you get your product faster and without additional customs costs. When our development board comes available I will certainly post it in this topic. </p><p>As I pointed out before the module offers much more IO and is smaller than some china routers. This enables one to build some really cool Internet of Things devices. </p><p>Thank you for your feedback on our products. </p><p>Mvg,<br/>Daan</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dpape</strong> on 29 Apr 2014, 16:23)</p>

In other words, I don&#039;t consider the Android miniPC from China is cheap, but rather inexpensive. There is a huge difference between <em>cheap</em> and <em>inexpensive</em>. The former lacks quality (as in lemon) while the later is a more in savings with good (if not the same or even better) quality as the comparable expensive products. For instance, a lot of folks jumped into bandwagon and paid more or less 2x the price of an Rpi system by the time they finish building the Rpi to start hacking it. This includes the price of the base Rpi unit (US$25) + enclosure casing ($10) + an AC/DC adapter ($10) + several S/H charges from many different vendors. They all will easily add up to US$50+. At the same time, I spent a little less than US$50 + 6% local sale TAX to buy five units of Seagate GoFLEX NET while some friends spent about US$15 (already includes S/H fees) to buy a used and/or new Seagate Dockstar from e-bay. Granted an Rpi comes with a newer CPU clocked @800MHz and more RAM than any Seagate Dockstar and/or GoFLEX NET. But, the Seagate devices CPU is clocked @1.2GHz and that makes any application runs smoother.</p><p>BTW, I visited the <a href="http://www.we-io.net/">link</a> you provided above and noticed the software is under a GPL3.

					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;m not just selling promises I think, I&#039;m selling exactly what is on the site. And that is a certified (CE/FCC/RoHS) AR9331 module, we are setting up our github repositories and our second revision of the breakout board is now built in the PCB factory. You can follow our progress on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dptechnics">https://www.facebook.com/dptechnics</a> </p><p>We have written some custom software for easy GPIO control and as soon as it is available we will release it on our gitHub. We want to make everything open source, even our development processes. Therefore we like to keep people up to date on facebook and twitter. </p><p>Kind regards,<br/>Daan</p>									</div>

					<p>@dpape, can you please share which are all GPIO pins on Carambola 2 that are freely used, and that don&#039;t cause bootloader to stop loading or any other issues. Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>I don&#039;t own a Carambola 2 device, we sell an other module with similar capabilities and built in WiFi antenna. The GPIO information can be found in the datasheet <a href="https://www.dptechnics.com/datasheets/openwrtmodule_datasheet_rev2.pdf">https://www.dptechnics.com/datasheets/openwrtmodule_datasheet_rev2.pdf</a> </p><p>Kind regards,<br/>Daan</p>									</div>
