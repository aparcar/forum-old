					<p>Hello!</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve been searching this in the web and didn&#039;t find any apropriate answer. I have OpenVPN server set on my WRT. And I&#039;d like to use DHCP for the clients but then there shuld not be any dw-gateway set (or DNS too). How to change it? I&#039;ve tried some settings in /etc/dnsmasq but didn&#039;t get it working...</p><p>Kobi</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello Kobi,</p><p>I&#039;m actually struggling with the same issue.&nbsp; OpenVPN faq says that when you allow remote clients to use the local DHCP server over the tunnel, you have to configure the DHCP server to figure out that the request comes from a VPN client and not to send the default gateway option.&nbsp; I just went through dnsmasq documentation and I cannot see a way to do that.&nbsp; Well maybe apart from using dhcp-host directives and recognizing VPN clients by MAC address, but that seems like a maintenance nightmare.</p><p>Did you have any luck with that?&nbsp; Or maybe there&#039;s someone else here who&#039;s managed to do that?</p><p>EDIT: OK, I&#039;ve managed to do this, I&#039;ll explain how just in case anyone tries that.</p><p>According to OpenVPN documentation, in order to use a bridged setup where the client uses the DHCP server on the local network (over the tunnel), the DHCP server needs to be configured so that it differentiates VPN clients from usual clients and does not send default gateway (routers option) nor DNS server options to the former ones.</p><p>One point about OpenVPN clients which helps greatly with that differentiation is they use a tap driver for the virtual network adapter, and tap driver always assigns MAC addresses with prefix 00:FF. DHCP can then recognize a VPN client by that prefix.</p><p>In dnsmasq this can be done by first tagging it with &#039;dhcp-mac&#039; option, and then using &#039;dhcp-option&#039; with that tag. Note that in order to send a blank option you have to do e.g. &#039;dhcp-option=tag,3,&#039; (i.e. specify the option field, just leave it blank), despite what dnsmasq docs say (i.e. they say to do &#039;dhcp-option=tag,3&#039; but it doesn&#039;t work). One problem I&#039;m having here is I&#039;ve noticed when I send these options, the client gets assigned netmask=255.0.0.0 which is incorrect, and I couldn&#039;t force it with &#039;dhcp-option=tag,1,255.255.255.0&#039;.&nbsp; But apart from that this config works all right.</p><p>Well, that&#039;s it, this seems to work for me, if I find a way to send correct netmask to VPN clients I&#039;ll post the solution here.&nbsp; So good luck in your adventures with OpenVPN, heh <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>UPDATE: I resolved the problem with incorrect netmask by defining a separate range for VPN clients using `dhcp-range=net:tag,START,END,MASK,BROADCAST,LEASE&#039; statement.&nbsp; In order for this to fully work I had to stop dnsmasq (`killall dnsmasq`), edit the lease file (`/tmp/dhcp.leases`) to remove leases belonging to VPN clients, and finally reboot the client (possibly `ipconfig /release` would be enough in a windows client so that it sends DHCPDISCOVER instead of DHCPREQUEST).&nbsp; I also made sure that dnsmasq doesn&#039;t know about the previous lease of the client by sending SIGUSR1 and checking the log, before connecting the client.</p><p>Whew.&nbsp; Why haven&#039;t I thought about this before <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />)))</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tzeentch.gm</strong> on 9 Apr 2007, 01:17)</p>
