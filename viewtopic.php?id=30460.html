					<p>Thanks to <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/7246">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/7246</a> and <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/6580">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/6580</a> I have a booting kernel and filesystem on my WRT320N which has been converted into an E2000. I added the device ID&#039;s and such to the required files and got it all working I can post my changes in that area if requested but my plan was to wait till I got it all working.</p><p>The main issue I have right now is I have no wired networking. The kernel claims to detect a proper networking switch and sets the IP but I get nothing on the outside. It appears to be a 53115 switch as with the other brcm4716 based routers and the kernel detects it as such.</p><p>I&#039;ve been digging through the kernel code but I can&#039;t seem to find anywhere that would tell me what might be going wrong.</p><p>Any help would be appreciated and I can post any dumps or kernel logs needed, just let me know what would be most helpful.</p>									</div>
