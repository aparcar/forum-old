					<p>Hello,</p><p>I recently tried to install iptraf using <em>opkg update &amp;&amp; opkg install iptraf</em>. The installation failed somehow (no logs available by now).

					<p>I have been seeing the same problem.&nbsp; I have one package with a &#039;postrm&#039; script that calls &#039;opkg remove&#039; on multiple other packages.&nbsp; Opkg calling opkg...which makes sense why the lock exists.</p><p>I decided to remove the lock and see what happens.&nbsp; Opkg removes the packages correctly but does not update its package list accordingly.&nbsp; So, if I do an &#039;opkg list_installed | grep pkg&#039; then opkg still believes the package exists, but in reality all binaries related to that package have been removed.</p><p>Tips anyone?</p>									</div>

					<p>I used to have the same problem.<br />Unfortunately I don&#039;t remember what finally helped me, but you could try this:<br />Add the following two lines to the opkg.conf:</p><p>option force_space<br />option overlay_root /jffs</p>									</div>

					<p>None of these suggestions helped to avoid the error.

					<p>Oh, I forgot to mention my fix.&nbsp; The problem for me was during the removal process.&nbsp; Since the packages were on the mini_fo overlay, the packages that were causing this problem were referencing /var/, but the overlay doesnt know about /var/, and thus I modified the info.list file to not reference those (since its just a memory location).&nbsp; It seemed to work for me...so I ran this script before removal.</p><p># Remove any references to /var/ otherwise opkg<br /># passes in NULLs to the FS overlay system<br />for I in /usr/lib/opkg/info/*; do<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sed &#039;/var/d&#039; $I &gt; /usr/lib/opkg/info/bak.txt<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mv /usr/lib/opkg/info/bak.txt $I<br />done</p>									</div>

					<p>Just reading up, it looks like you are trying to install your package to / which is full.&nbsp; What does &quot;cat /etc/opkg.conf&quot; provide.&nbsp; You probably have to modify that to inform opkg to install your packate to your /tmp/ tmpfs mount.</p>									</div>
