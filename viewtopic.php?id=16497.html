					<p>I am using OpenWrt for some time on my WRT54GL with very, very little problems. </p><p>Now I got my old Edimax 6104K router out and wanted to put Kamikaze on it, to give it a second live. I got an old serial Siemens mobile phone cable and connected it to the router. Because there is no ready image for this platform I had to build the system from source and installed it via xmodem on the hardware. There where still no problems up to this moment but then I dicovered that the adm1520 hardware seems to differ a lot from the WRT54GL.</p><p>The ethernet port are working but I am not able to map different physical port together to one VLAN. Documentation is always pointing to same page in the Mips wiki: <a href="http://www.linux-mips.org/wiki/ADM5120_switch">http://www.linux-mips.org/wiki/ADM5120_switch</a><br />But the <strong>admswconfig</strong> tool described there differs from the one used in OpenWrt. VLANs there are named <strong>vlan0</strong> to <strong>vlan5</strong> and <strong>eth0</strong> to <strong>eth5</strong> in OpenWrt. In unconfigured state the <strong>admswconfig</strong> tool reports the following settings<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/# admswconfig
ethX    port0   port1   port2   port3   port4   CPU
0          1                                                        1
1                       1                                           1
2                                   1                               1
3                                            1                      1
4                                                        1          1</code></pre></div><p>I wanted to map 3 port together and keep the other two in their <em>own</em> vlans by putting this in <strong>/etc/config/network</strong>:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config switch
        option eth0     &quot;0&quot;
        option eth1     &quot;1&quot;
        option eth2     &quot;2 3 4&quot;
        option eth3     &quot;&quot;
        option eth4     &quot;&quot;
        option eth5     &quot;&quot;</code></pre></div><p>This leads to the following configuration after booting, which seem to make sense to me:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/# admswconfig
ethX    port0   port1   port2   port3   port4   CPU
0       1                                       1
1               1                               1
2                       1       1       1       1
