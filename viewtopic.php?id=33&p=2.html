					<p>The 634U doesn&#039;t have a boot_wait flag. But you can &quot;emulate&quot; that by setting the ENV var &quot;STARTUP&quot; to the following value:</p><p>&quot;ifconfig eth0 -addr=192.168.1.150 -mask=255.255.255.0;boot -z -elf -tftp 192.168.1.100:vmlinux.gz;boot -z -elf flash0.os&quot;</p><p>192.168.1.150 = IP Address of the 634U<br />192.168.1.100 = IP Address of a TFTP server<br />vmlinux.gz = GZip compressed elf kernel to fetch and run from the TFTP server.</p><p>This will try to download the file from the TFTP server. If the download fails it will fall back to boot from flash.</p><p>BE CAREFULL: I dont know wether the default kernel of Netgear is compressed. If it is not you need to remove the &quot;-z&quot; to load uncompressed files. Check the contents of STARTUP before overwriting it!</p><p>Hope this helps,<br />&nbsp; Florian</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>i&#039;m not entirely sure how the Netgear upgrade process works. The flash layout is totally different and it might be the case that the fallback tftp server is in a readonly area of the flash and is invoked after a broken upgrade. Haven&#039;t investigated that.</p><p>Anyway i like the Netgear approach much more. Its possible to boot a kernel without actually flashing it. So if its a broken kernel - nevermind just powercycle and you&#039;re good to go again. It helped me much during the kernel development phase.</p><p>Best,<br />&nbsp; Florian</p>									</div>
