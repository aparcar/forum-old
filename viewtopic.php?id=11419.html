					<p>The first WIP-Day has past - a little quiet, but it made its debut. One of the questions which came up during the 24 hours, was concerned with OpenWrt being in need of a &#039;documentation-team&#039;, and a &#039;team-leader&#039; to lead it. This subject is open for further discussion and suggestions from all members.</p><p>The next WIP-Day will take place on saturday the 28. of July (last saturday in the month) from UTC 12.00 and 24 hours ahead.</p>									</div>

It will start on next saturday, 28. of July, at UTC 12.00 and run for the following 24 hours.<br />All you need to do to participate is to join the #openwrt-devel channel and present what you would like to do, or ask for help with a project, alternatively make an entry in the forum.</p><p>This will be an opportunity to write-up new howtos and get help with all the small details and big questions :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>Dear OpenWrt&#039;..rs</p><p>The up-coming weekend will again be host to 24 hours of WIP-Day<br />activities, beginning on saturday a UTC 12.00.

Documentation-Team</p><p>2. Release-Team</p><p>3. Copyright discussion</p><p>4. Social OpenWrt-It :-)</p><p>5. Misc ... ?</p><p>Apart from this, there should be plenty of room for more practical<br />activites such as editing and moving some of the present howtos to the OpenWrt wiki or giving the core-dev group feedback on the recent/upcoming release :-)</p><p>Chz</p>									</div>
