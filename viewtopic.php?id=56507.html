					<p>I am new to OpenWRT and love it,&nbsp; I had a question -</p><p>I am running a Netgear WNDR3700V4 running OpenWRT.&nbsp; All my clients are connected to a 50 port switch connected to this device.&nbsp; The netgear has two interfaces listed LAN / WAN.&nbsp; I set the LAN ip to 10.0.0.1 and type to static address and DHCP is set to start at 100 and limit to 150</p><p>I am provided a DHCP address up stream that is in the 192.168.1.X (NAT again),&nbsp; Normally this is fine, so I set the WAN interface to DHCP client</p><br /><p>Problem: My client computers on the netgear are not pulling 10.0.0.x DHCP Ip&#039;s they are pulling DHCP from the upstream device in the 192.168.1.x range and I am not sure why.&nbsp; Also the one computer that is connected to the router in the 10.0.0.x range is using the IP 10.0.0.149 when I would have assumed it would have been 10.0.0.100?</p><p>Any help would be great</p>									</div>
