					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am running OpenWRT as an OpenVPN client.</p><p>I have succesfully configured the OpenVPN client and now traffic from my OpenWRT LAN clients is routed through the VPN tunnel (so What is My IP shows IP of the server).</p><p>But I have DNS leaking, because the OpenWRT LAN clients receive the OpenWRT machine as a DNS server, and this seems to be forwarding the original ISP DNS, not sending DNS requests through the tunnel.</p><p>Is there any way to get LAN client DNS requests going through the openvpn tunnel in a way that is robust to the tunnel going down.</p><p>Ideally I would like to specify manually DNS servers on the WAN interface (ie uncheck &quot;Use DNS servers advertised by peer&quot; for when the openvpn connection is down, but when the openvpn connection is up, use the openvpn host for DNS queries.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure whether the DNS forwarder on OpenWRT can be confiured to update in this way?</p>									</div>

					<p>On the LUCI interface go to:<br />Network &gt; Interfaces<br />WAN &gt; edit<br />Common configuration &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; Uncheck use advertised dns &gt; input your own</p><p>Input the DNS provided by your VPN provider (or whatever DNS servers you want to use) and you&#039;re done.</p><p>Using up/down scripts to handle DNS is useful for things like laptops and such who may be transitioning between networks a lot and want/need to use the local DNS servers when not connected to the VPN. For something like a router that will be maintaining an always-on VPN tunnel, there&#039;s really no benefit, and the risk of it breaking things (restoring old and outdated settings) is more impactful since it can harm your whole network instead of just the client running it.</p><p>Also, if you have services on your router that restart dnsmasq (such as adblock), you may lose your VPN DNS and revert to default.</p><p>TL;DR, up/down VPN DNS scripts are probably a bad idea.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks - thats what I went with in the end.</p><p>In this case I am mailing the client device to an end user and I was hoping to not hard code anything about the server (other than hostname and port) as the server might change ISP at some point in the future. So I wanted the client to pick up the DNS from there when it changes.</p><p>As it is now if server ISP changes I will have to get access to the client box to manually update the DNS to those of the new ISP. </p><p>But I think it should be possible.</p><p>Thanks again for the help.</p><p>In case it is of interest I am running on a Nexx WT3020 and get about 8Mbit/s through openvpn (blowfish) (from cabled LAN, openvpn running over wifi wwan)</p><p>Server is a beaglebone black running debian which can support up to about 30Mbit/s.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>thrope</strong> on 11 Dec 2016, 19:32)</p>

I originally installed OpenWRT March 2015 using openwrt-ramips-mt7620-wt3020-8M-squashfs-factory.bin. I don&#039;t remember any issues or requiring a separate bootloader - I think I just uploaded that file to flash through the stock web interface.</p><p>Now I got it back out of the cupboard and upgraded to openwrt-15.05.1-ramips-mt7620-wt3020-8M-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin through OpenWRT itself.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>ulmwind wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Thank you for information, the speed limit 8Mbit/s is the limit of router itself?</p></blockquote></div><p>I think it is the limit of the CPU on the WT3020 to encrypt/decrypt the packets. It is possible to run openvpn with no cipher at all I think which would presumably give higher throughput, but 8Mbit is already faster than the connection this will be on anyway so fine for me.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, thank you. You use stock bootloader. You can use it, but it doesn&#039;t have emergency recovery feature initiated by Reset button. In case of firmware corruption the only way to recover is to disassemble router and solder UART to it. I recommend you breed-mt7620-reset1.bin, but to update it you should initially flash another firmware, because OpenWRT image from repository blocks writing of bootloader.</p><p>Thank you, so the processor load is not 100% when the speed is attained?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ulmwind</strong> on 12 Dec 2016, 15:19)</p>
