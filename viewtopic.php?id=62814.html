					<p>I have been trying to figure out how to compile Asterisk and Asterisk applications for OpenWRT, but have found little to no documentation on how to do this. I know that this question has been asked before (<a href="https://community.asterisk.org/t/openwrt-cross-compiling-howto/40259">Here</a>), but I have not been able to find any answers.</p><p>Mainly my goals is to develop Asterisk apps and build them into .ipk files to be installed on a preexisting OpenWRT machine.</p><p>Any help would be very much appreciated.</p><p>Thank you,<br />-ED</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>edatsecure</strong> on 18 Feb 2016, 02:40)</p>

					<p>I have been working on this one for the past few weeks and think that I have it pretty much figured out.</p><p>If you are just looking to make an .ipk file of an app that is already included (e.g. Alarm Receiver) do the following:<br /></p><ol class="decimal"><li><p>Download the OpenWrt image builder/generator</p></li><li><p>Extract and move into the top level OpenWrt directory</p></li><li><p>Run <span style="color: blue">$ ./scripts/feeds update -a</span></p></li><li><p>Run <span style="color: blue">$ ./scripts/feeds install -a</span></p></li><li><p>Run <span style="color: blue">$ sudo make menuconfig</span></p></li><li><p>Select the proper Target System and Target Profile</p></li><li><p>Select the modules you want (Astierks and AST Modules are under Network-&gt;Telephony)</p></li><li><p>Exit the menuconfig (saving changes) and run <span style="color: blue">$ sudo make</span> (ideally you would make the package/name/compile, but this does not work for all packages including Asterisk)</p></li><li><p>When finished, the .ipk should be under the bin dir somewhere (for the ar71xx processor, app-alarmreceiver was under bin/ar71xx/packages/telephony)</p></li></ol><p>If you are looking to make an .ipk of a custom Asterisk application, the following worked for me:<br /></p><ol class="decimal"><li><p>Go through the list above with selecting the Asterisk package under menuconfig</p></li><li><p>Go to the dl dir and find the asterisk tar file</p></li><li><p>Add your custom module to this tar (i.e. extract, add the module to the desired directory, and re-tar)</p></li><li><p>Open the feeds/telephony/net/asterisk-11.x/Makefile (or whichever version you are making)</p></li><li><p>Comment out (or remove) the &quot;PKG_SOURCE_URL:=....&quot; line</p></li><li><p>Near the bottom add module info with the rest of the modules (e.g. <br />$(eval $(call BuildAsterisk11Module,app-helloworld,Hello World,A simple hello world program,[dependencies],,,app_helloworld,))&nbsp; )<br />NOTE: Remember that make files are very sensitive to white space.</p></li><li><p>Save changes, go back into the menuconfig (<span style="color: blue">$ sudo make menuconfig</span>), and select the new module</p></li><li><p>Run <span style="color: blue">$ sudo make</span> and, when finished, the .ipk file should be under the bin dir somewhere (like above).</p></li></ol>									</div>
