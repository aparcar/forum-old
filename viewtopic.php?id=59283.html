					<p>Hello Guys!<br />I really need your help with my network configuration.<br />I have following situation.<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp; DSL router<br />o&nbsp; &nbsp; Internet Connection<br />o&nbsp; &nbsp; 3 Devices on switch<br />o&nbsp; &nbsp; Wired connection to OpenWRT-Router<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp; OpenWRT-Router<br />o&nbsp; &nbsp; Wireless Access Point<br />o&nbsp; &nbsp; More devise on switch</p><p>Since the DSL-Router is from my ISP I can’t change it as easy but I’m facing some really bad problems with it when a few devices are connected and active.<br />So I bought a second router and flashed OpenWRT 14.07 over it.<br />Since I also don’t trust the DSL-Router I want to have it in a different Subnet (10.0.0.0/24) than the rest of my Home-Network (192.168.1.0/24). So I thought it would be nice if the DSL-Router has the Address 10.0.0.1/24 and the OpenWRT-Router gets 192.168.1.1/24 and all Devices get the OpenWRT-Adress as Defaultgetway.<br />This setup would be relatively easy but the problem is, I have devices attached to booth rooters and I want to be able communicate between all of them.<br />I tried lots of stuff but all failed. Is this setup even possible? If yes, how?<br />You can see the desired configuration here:<br /><a href="http://de.tinypic.com/r/29bkebl/8">http://de.tinypic.com/r/29bkebl/8</a></p><p>Thanks in advance</p><p>An0nym3</p>									</div>

					<p>hi</p><p>some houghts<br />-considering you want to get all of them to comunicate with eachother ... get a switch<br />-considering they all pass trough DSL router.. theres no point in adding another router</p><p>regarding OWRT<br />-if you disable lan side DHCP it works as a switch; also WIFI works; they take dhcp ip from DSL lan side; connect DSL lan side to OWRT lan side<br />-also you can transform OWRT wan port into a lan port(its easy search forum..make shure you can get failsafe mode before messing with switch config )</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makarel</strong> on 30 Aug 2015, 17:59)</p>
