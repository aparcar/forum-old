					<p>I had been running WR RC6 for a couple of weeks now. Everything was just perfect... until yesterday afternoon. </p><p>I saw a new file &quot;[&quot; in my /usr/bin folder and i ran it to figure out what it is (i know.. that was dumb..). It gave me a segment fault error and the ssh crashed. I was not able to ssh in after that. But interestingly enough, the webserver (lighttpd) and ftp server (vsftpd) were still running perfect. So I assumed when I get back home and reboot the router, it should be up again. </p><p>But after i rebooted (plugged out the power and plugged back in), the router just cant be accessed any more. There is no ping response and no packets are received to the PC. I tried everything I know (reset the nvm, firmware restoration through the Asus restore utility, Asus Ez-setup etc) but the router just doesnt seem to respond at all. But the WAN LED and the LAN LED corresponding to the socket connected to the PC are ON. And the router goes into the blinking power LED state on rebooting with the restore button pressed. But still it doesnt take any ping to the default 192.168.1.1 address and there are no received packets to the PC.</p><p>I had been auto backing up the binary daily using &quot;dd if=/dev/mtdblock/1 of=/XXX/firmware.trx&quot;. Is there any way I can reflash the trx file without any response from the router&#039;s LAN interface?</p><p>Any help/advice would be very much appreciated!</p>									</div>

					<p>Did you try tftp? I pseudo-bricked my WL-500g by setuiding/chowning busybox to &#039;nobody&#039; (tried to chown/setuid busybox httpd but that chowned/setuided the busybox bin of course). It didn&#039;t respond to ping at all. Tried starting it in diag mode (unplug cord, hold reset-button, plug in cord, wait a couple of seconds) and it responded to ping and tftp. </p><p>Correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but I believe diagmode/tftp should work in any case of fubared firmware. Fubared nvram not included...</p>									</div>

					<p>I have a problem with my asus wl500gP. I have flashed it with an image of kamikaze of someone. I can ssh and telnet to it, but have no login or password. So i want to go back to rc6. I put it in diagmode, but then it doesn&#039;t answer anymore (timeout). The asus restore tool cant find anything and there is nog webif. Any idea&#039;s here? I have tried it also with a crossover cable directly from my computer.</p>									</div>

					<p>folo.. I could not get a ping even in the diag mode. Anyways I got it replaced by Asus. </p><p>ewobbuh.. that sounds like my case too. I believe you can get a replacement from Asus. Just dont mention the taboo word &quot;openwrt&quot;.. just act dumb as to how it stopped working.. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Today I had a very similar problem. I did a vi on /usr/sbin/crond and it gave me a &quot;segmentation fault&quot;. Since then I could not open a new putty terminal. The ssh authentication prompt comes up on putty, but as soon as i enter the password, terminal closes by itself. This was reminiscent of what happened last time. Fortunately I had another putty terminal open and I did an mtd restore of the trx image. After a reboot, everything is working perfect now. I believe if I had rebooted the router in that &quot;segmentation fault&quot; state it would have bricked my router like last time. Has anyone else seen a similar case before? Can a &quot;vi&quot; command over-write or corrupt the kernel?</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve read recently a pity info on some russian site about chips in 500gP - it seems to be very cheap flash chip inside and it can fault. That russian guy just replaced it with brand AMD chip and is very happy after that.</p>									</div>
