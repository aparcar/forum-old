					<p>Is there a guide on this somewhere? I&#039;ve been suggested to run squid on my main router (WDS/AP) but I have no idea how to do such a thing and I don&#039;t know how much space I need? Should I use and usb flash based drive or an hdd drive? I guess I need to make a swap partition and an ext3 for the cache? Any link is welcomed.. when I&#039;m done I&#039;ll write and howto for others...</p>									</div>
