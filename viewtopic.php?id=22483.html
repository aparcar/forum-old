					<p>Hi.</p><p>Those parameters only come into play if you need to reflash your router some day. If everything is broken, because you locked yourself out or similar then you need those to be able to reflash the firmware with tftp. You need to login with ssh on the device and execute the commands above. If you haven&#039;t set/change the password on your device yet then ssh is not available and you need to login using telnet.</p><p>~ JoW</p>									</div>
