					<p>Hi, i&#039;ve build today openwrt image for this router i&#039;ve add madwifi-ng driver for ath0 wirless card but i&#039;ve see that the version of kismet is too old for support madwifi-ng drivers... My question are:<br />1. Exist anyone that have build new version of kismet for this router?<br />2. Madwifi(old) works with kismet, i&#039;ve try with kamikaze and they don&#039;t works...<br />3. A method to works kismet under wgt634u <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Thank you for reply, regards.</p>									</div>

					<p>Dragorn has instructions for building with the new devel source on kismetwireless.net (works with madwifi-ng, broadcomm, ipw2100, ipw2200, and all kinds of other interfaces that the &quot;release&quot; doesn&#039;t).</p><p><a href="http://www.kismetwireless.net/blog/index.php?date=20051219">http://www.kismetwireless.net/blog/inde â€¦ e=20051219</a></p><p>The build is the same as for the wrt54G. I have several drones up on both wgt634u&#039;s and wrt54Gs. The 634u&#039;s are much more sensitive.</p><p>In a nutshell (assuming you&#039;re familiar with both kismet and openwrt build processes):</p><p>1) svn the current kismet-devel source down<br />2) compile per Dragorn&#039;s documentation, pointing at your own dev environment<br />3) configure a monitor interface on the box <br />4) configure for madwifing_g source pointing at the interface you created (or madwifing_ag if you have replaced the card with something nicer)<br />5) start up kismet_drone or kismet_server and knock yourself out.</p><p>Newcore works too, if you get adventurous.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>whm3</strong> on 13 Mar 2006, 23:46)</p>
