					<p>Good idea, but it is not as easy as it looks at first sight...</p><p>First, on a purely hardware point of view, you will have to be careful, the GPIOs o nthe TL-WR703N are 2.7V only, NOT 5V nor even 3.3V tolerant. </p><p>You will have to adjust the IR receiver&#039;s output level to this voltage, the simplest is by using a resistor bridge. On the output side, you will have to make sure that a 2.7V drive level will fully turn on the IR LEDs too.</p><p>Basically, you will need 2 GPIO outputs and 1 GPIO input with interrupts. If you dan&#039;t want to mess with fine SMD soldering ,the easiest on the TL-WR703N would be to use the unmounted through-hole LED in parallele to the normal LED as the IR LED output GPIO, to wire the IR receiver in parallel on the RESET switch and to use the USB power (GPIO8) for powering the IR receiver.</p><p>Second, the kernel space driver: the proposed patch is using interrupts for the IR Receiver input, but AFAIK this is not implemented for the AR9331 SoC, only GPIO polling is working, so you will have to take the AR9331 datasheet and implement GPIO IRQs into the kernel first, or modify the driver to work with polled GPIOs, if it s possible.</p><p>Third, how to compile the stuff for AA: as explained above, this depends if you are using IRQs or polled GPIOs for the IR receiver&#039;s output: in the first case, this would require modifying the GPIOs handling in the AA kernel to support AR9331 GPIO IRQs and create a kmod-lirc-gpio kernel module for it. In the second case, only the additional kernel module is required.</p><p>In both cases, you will have to create a custom kernel package, check the Wiki:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/start">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/start</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtain.firmware.sdk">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtain.firmware.sdk</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/packages">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/packages</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks Squonk. Didn&#039;t know about the 2.7V. Are you sure about the pins not being 3.3V tolerant? (Don&#039;t want to try ;-)</p><p>Right now I have an ATmega328p running an Arduino sketch hooked up to 3.3V power and have connected it to TP_IN and TP_OUT for serial connection, and it appears to work well for me. The ATmega328p in turn is connected to a TSOP infrared reciver and an IR LED. By removing the ATmega328p I could bring down the BOM somewhat.</p><p>Do I really have to build the whole kernel or can I just build a kernel module in a way that it is compatible with the stock BB packages?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>probono</strong> on 26 Dec 2013, 14:20)</p>

On the IR LED side, you&#039;d better put several IR LEDs in series to get a sufficient range, and in this case, a transistor with a base series resistor is required anyway.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>probono wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Do I really have to build the whole kernel or can I just build a kernel module in a way that it is compatible with the stock BB packages?</p></blockquote></div><p>Kernel version/name includes a hash checksum of config options, and the kernel modifications will depend on that checksum as it is part of the kernel version/name. The goal is to ensure that the kmods to be installed have been compiled using exactly the same options as the main kernel:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=180769#p180769">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 69#p180769</a></p><p>I may be wrong, but as you will need a new config option for your kmod-lirc-gpio module, ypu won&#039;t be able to get the exact same options as in the stock BB kernel...</p><p>But IMHO, the biggest problem is related to GPIO IRQ handling for an AR9331 kernel.</p>									</div>
