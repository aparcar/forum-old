					<p>Let&#039;s see if somebody can answer this simple question. I have the latest stable openwrt running on an NSLU2.&nbsp; I would like to mount a file system from a USB attached storage instead of /jffs. I cannot umount /jffs, however.</p><p>umount /jffs<br />umount: cannot umount /jffs: Device or resource busy</p><p>Even when I move /jffs with something like:<br />mount -o move /jffs /tmp/BLA</p><p>and mount a filesystem on /jffs, say with:</p><p>mount /dev/sda1 /jffs</p><p>when I install applications with opkg, data *still gets written to /tmp/BLA* where I moved /jffs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p>Please help me with this, because this really renders the NSLU2 useless to me with openwrt, seeing as it does not permit installing any software on external storage!</p>									</div>
