					<p>Hi,</p><p>As you may be aware, we&#039;re reverse engineering the Broadcom driver in order to use the chipset. Please see <a href="http://bcm-specs.sipsolutions.net">http://bcm-specs.sipsolutions.net</a>/ for more information.</p><p>To help complete(*) this, I&#039;m currently looking for help and testers on the wrt platform. Essentially, I&#039;d like to obtain logs of accesses that the driver does to the memory mapped space of the chip. The idea is simple:<br />1) hack ioremap to return some unmapped address for the wl driver<br />2) in do_page_fault(), &quot;catch&quot; the access fault to that address range<br />3) call a copy of the unaligned handler that printk&#039;s the accesses, their size and whether it was read or write<br />4) also have the pci config space accessor functions printk what they do</p><p>Then, having netconsole configured into the kernel, one should be able to log what the driver is doing to the chip.</p><p>I&#039;m doing something similar inside MOL (mac-on-linux) but I need DMA for the loopback test which doesn&#039;t work in PIO mode, and I cannot run the OSX driver inside MOL in DMA mode.</p><p>If anyone is interested in helping I&#039;d appreciate a note via email.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Johannes</p><p>(*) we can currently transmit frames, but we don&#039;t know why not receive</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello johill,</p><p>I am interested in helping you. When I come back home on wednesday, I will set up a netconsole enabled kernel and give you SSH access to the box if it seems ok to you ?</p><p>I saw on your website that the driver intends to support 2.6 kernels, you know that the OpenWrt one is running a 2.4 one ? It may be a hard work patching the 2.6 kernel with the 2.4 hacks the openwrt developpers are using, but as explained here : <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/Kernel26Firmware?highlight=%282.6%29">http://wiki.openwrt.org/Kernel26Firmwar … =%282.6%29</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi RItalMan,</p><p>Yes, the driver is specifically targetted for 2.6 kernels, and I doubt it&#039;ll be easy to backport it. However, right now I&#039;m not much interested in running the new driver on the wrt, but rather patching the 2.4 kernel with what I wrote above to see what their driver is doing.</p><p>However, I&#039;d also need help with that, as I haven&#039;t really worked on kernel code for mips so far. Steps 1-4 of what I wrote above is what I want to do on the box, but before that someone would obviously need to write those kernel patches...</p><p>johannes</p>									</div>

					<p>I tried cooking up a patch. It compiles, but I have no idea if it runs. Also, the hardware address of the broadcom device is hardcoded to (0x400something) in the patch so if it&#039;s different for you you&#039;ll have to adjust that.</p><p><a href="http://johannes.sipsolutions.net/files/mips-wireless-log-1st-try.patch">http://johannes.sipsolutions.net/files/ … -try.patch</a></p><p>Please enable netconsole if you try running it. And don&#039;t attempt unless you can reflash your device easily if&nbsp; the kernel breaks etc etc etc.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;d still appreciate if someone were to test that patch because it might be useful for other things, but right now I&#039;m not really interested in it on this chipset any more. Got what I wanted another way.</p>									</div>
