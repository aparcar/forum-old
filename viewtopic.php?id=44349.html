					<p>My router seems to be working OK, but I was having problems with the wireless.&nbsp; I have reinstalled Attitude Adjustment a number of time, change my configs, and then once I enable wireless... the power light shuts off, the wireless light shuts off, then all lights shut off then flash back on, and the cycle repeats forever... even after a reboot.</p><p>I&#039;m thinking that maybe the wireless card is fried, and perhaps it&#039;s finally time to put an atheros card in here.</p><p>Is there anything in particular I should look for??&nbsp; Or are all atheros chipsets supported on Attitude Adjustment??</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;d suggest to check your PSU first, most wall warts aren&#039;t of particularly good quality (including theWLl-500gP) and may not provide enough power anymore (aging capacitors).</p><p>If your PSU isn&#039;t the problem (although your descriptions sounds a lot like that), I&#039;d rather suggest to replace the whole router with a modern design - which won&#039;t be much more expensive than a semi-decent replacement mini-pci wlan card, while at the same time offering GBit/s ethernet switches and actually the processing power to drive 802.11n (or dual-radio).</p>									</div>

					<p>So on this router, is the psu considered the a/c adapter, or is there an actual box inside with wires??&nbsp; Thinking just the adapter, but want to make sure.</p><p>I actually did have a problem with loading too much power thru a surge protector connected to one socket in the wall, and that one socet is looking rather crispy now.&nbsp; Replaced the surge protector, but this problem has been intermittent until yesterday.&nbsp; Now there&#039;s no wireless at all.</p><p>I would imagine that a new adapter and mini pci card wouldn&#039;t be much more than $20.&nbsp; At least not on eBay.</p><p>Is there another router with more ram, atheros chipset, and usb 3.0 ports that I should be considering??</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, the PSU is the a/c adapter. Although there is also a step-down circuit inside the router, which might cause problems due to aged capaciators. About other routers with more power, check the table of hardware in the wiki.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well... I was looking for some new routers, and the Netgear WNDR4700 looked nice, altho definitely way more than I&#039;d realistically want to pay right now.&nbsp; Altho, it does seem awfully convenient and would make backups extra easy.</p><p>I decided to just go ahead and purchase an ac adapter from Radio Shack for around $43 after taxes.&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" />&nbsp; &nbsp;It is rated for 2.0 amps, while the original, stock plug is rated for 2.5 amps.&nbsp; And the plug doesn&#039;t EXACTLY fit, but if I just set it still in one position, it manages to keep working... wireless, too!!&nbsp; I guess I&#039;m going to order a replacement adapter and take this one back to &quot;The Shack&quot;.&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>How important do you guys think the 2.0 -vs- 2.5 amp issue is for the adapter?&nbsp; If 2.0 works, is that an acceptable replacement?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>grndslm</strong> on 25 May 2013, 06:59)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the suggestion, slh.&nbsp; You were most definitely right.</p><p>I&#039;m still interested in getting a mini pci atheros chipset, tho.&nbsp; Will 12.09 (Attitude) support ALL atheros chipsets?&nbsp; Is there anything in particular I should be looking for?? ... specific to OpenWRT?&nbsp; ... or specific to the WL500gP?</p>									</div>
