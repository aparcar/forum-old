					<p>Yes, I am installing feeds. I did not claim anything else.<br />Why did I post here and not into General Forum? Because it asks about feeds and package dependency in them, something I think is related more to development than to general configuration.<br />What is the problem?<br />Maybe there is no problem, maybe it is just me not knowing how to do it.</p><p>Wiki page here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials</a> explicitly names luci packages which are used in OpenWRT build.<br />I assumed there might be then some mechanism to include those (and only those) packages into build.<br />But whenever I try to &quot;install&quot; luci, luci-ssl, or even some specific package (e.g. luci-mod-admin-full) it automatically installs all the packages I already mentioned above, like mysql, postgres, radvd, etc.</p><p>So I am asking, if there is possibility to install feeds only for packages which are mentioned on the wiki page, without the additional stuff. If not and I need to install manually individual packages, then I wonder which ones, because for example already mentioned luci-mod-admin-full imports everything.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>risa2000</strong> on 2 Oct 2011, 13:29)</p>

					<p>Those are build dependencies, they&#039;re always installed because they might be needed by a component. That does not mean that thy must be built though, but the buildroot cannot figure it out in advance, therfore it installs all referenced feed packages regardless of whether they&#039;re needed or not.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, lets imagine I want to build LuCI with only packages described on wiki (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials</a>).<br />Which feeds should I install?<br />Taking into account I do not want to install feeds for mysql, postgres, radvd, etc., because I do not need them. In fact I do not need most of the packages which are imported with luci or luci-ssl. For the others, I do not even know what they do, so I would rather stick to the documented list. The reason why I do not want them install is that I do not want them to be shown in config file, so I do not have to manage them there.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thats not possible without patching LuCI. All those single packages are really just one big Makefile which defines a few dozens of components. The buildroot aggregates all build dependencies of all packages defined within a single source package. So your only choice here is to patch the LuCI Makefile to strip out all unneeded components.</p>									</div>

					<p>jow, thanks for the explanation. I was afraid it might be the case <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />. So it seems, I need to dig into config file and deselect all the abundant stuff.</p>									</div>

					<p>Orca, have you tried it yourself? I have tried to add luci-ssl and then configure it in config file, but gave up. There are too many things added by this metapackage (libraries, applications, etc.) and I had no idea which I could remove and which I should not, because the dependency is difficult to track.<br />I cannot build all the packages (some of them are pretty big, like perl, mysql, postgres, samba) just for the sake of building them. It takes quite a lot of time and some of them do not build at all.</p><p>I have no idea how do you manage.</p>									</div>

The ImageGenerator merely creates an OpenWrt image file out of the precompiled and then pre-packeted opkg packages. These opkg-packages are the same as those in the repository, but because you utilize the ImageGenerator, you put them onto the SquashFS-partition instead if installing them onto the JFFS2-partition. That is what you want, right?</p><p>FEEDS have to do with the source code. One feed comprises of the source code for one or for several packages, that are (not necessarily) maintained at OpenWrt!<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/feeds">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/feeds</a></p><p>And please read the rest of the wiki.</p>									</div>
