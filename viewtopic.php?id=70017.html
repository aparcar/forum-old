					<p><strong>Does anyone have any suggestions how I might setup OpenWrt for bridged Ethernet / Ethernet pass-through so I can take advantage of some features available with OpenWrt but not use OpenWrt as my wireless solution?</strong></p><p>For instance, I know I can setup:<br />- <span class="bbu">Double NAT</span>, but that can cause some issues with port forwarding<br />- I could try setting up <span class="bbu">static route</span> statements between OpenWrt and a router or firewall and only do NAT (IP masquerading) on one device<br />- I see there is a <span class="bbu">&quot;bridge&quot; package</span> that can be installed on OpenWrt but am not certain if that will do what I need</p><p>This question stems from my desire to not be limited by <span class="bbu">slow CPU, limited memory capacity, or slow Wireless capabilities</span>, but still be able to take advantage of unique features available through OpenWrt packages. If I had my choice, I would prefer to be able to install OpenWRT on a small computer or machine with 2 or more Gigabit Ethernet interfaces and a faster CPU with more memory but there seems to be limit of choices for beefier machines.</p><p>Since, I want to use an 802.11ac meshed network solution instead with seperate multiple WAP&#039;s and with wireless controller software. I also have a separate router I want to use for different firewall zones. What I am thinking is something like this for my home:<br />Cable modem --&gt; OpenWRT wireless router (with Wifi disabled) --&gt; (Beefier) Router or firewall --&gt; Managed Ethernet switch --&gt; LAN with different Zones:<br />- DMZ with public server(s)<br />- LAN devices, printers, private server(s), media server, &amp; handheld devices, security cameras with DVR<br />- Private Wi-Fi, meshed, multiple WAP&#039;s<br />- Guest Wi-Fi, meshed, multiple WAP&#039;s</p><p>Alternatively, If WiFi doesn&#039;t work well on a Wireless router for OpenWrt with i.e. close to 1GHz CPU and 128Mbps or more memory, can I just disable the Wifi on it and use my other, faster wireless solution(s)?</p><p>Any suggestions would be most helpful. Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s not clear what features of openwrt you want to use and if they can be used with a ethernet bridge.</p><p>You don&#039;t need to install any additional package to create an ethernet bridge. (brctl is part of busybox.)</p>									</div>
