					<p>OK, I&#039;ve been playing with 4 different pieces of software on my 54G, all to no avail...</p><p>WifiDog<br />NoCatSplash<br />ChilliSpot<br />ControlAP</p><p>All 4 pretty much exhibit similar behavior...they appear to run, but don&#039;t actually do anything. Any client that connects via wireless has free reign to surf the net without being first directed to a capture page.

(Someone said cron was probably the way to go for that...)</p><p>If anybody can share any success with the above 4 products (or a similar product that I haven&#039;t seen), I would be VERY much appreciative. However it is important that whatever I use only require the router for hardware (although needing access to an external web server already on the &#039;Net is OK.) </p><p>Thanks a lot in advance for any and all help.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Codo</strong> on 1 Jul 2005, 15:51)</p>

					<p>How do you want to do that at the ip level.<br />How can you control the client browser?<br />Do you want to redirect tcp to the internal web browser for any request to port 80?<br />Maybe this is possible through a proxy server?</p>									</div>

					<p>You don&#039;t need to control this at the IP level, because the browser does NOT work on that stack of the protocol layer. As far as the IP layer is concerned, the user&#039;s PC is doing what it is supposed to: &#039;I can&#039;t find that host on my local network, so I will forward the request to my gateway&#039; and at that point, communciation is between the PC and the router and the router and IT&#039;s gateway. Unless something inside the router&#039;s programming tells it not to operate as it usually does, maybe because the MAC address of the computer in question is not on a list of authorized users.</p><p>After that, you can control the client browser very easily. See, the browser is a dumb beast. It makes a request for the a webpage. Then your TCP/IP protocol stack starts wrapping things up into packets headed for the gateway. The trick is, the gateway never goes out and gets said page, it just delivers it&#039;s own. The browser doesn&#039;t know or care where the page is coming from, all it knows is that it requested a page and that it is being given a page by the device it asked to go fetch the page for it. Really it is no different than any corporate proxy or other program that prohibits surfing to certain websites.</p><p>See, again you&#039;ve got it wrong. I don&#039;t want to redirect TCP. I don&#039;t even want to mess with that layer of the protocol stack...there is no reason to. Everything I want to do occurs higher in the protocol stack.</p><p>Yes, proxy servers exhibit similar behavior, but a proxy is not what I want. I want the router to operate as a router like it always does EXCEPT when a new user authenticates to the wireless. At that point I want to intercept their first request for ANY website and instead give them my own site, and after that, as long as conditions are OK, become a transparent router once again to that user until such a point where the user has been taken off the network.</p><p>All four pieces of software I mentioned in my post already have this exact ability built in to varying degrees. Some of them will not even let you surf to ANY page at all unless you complete a login page, one just shows your capture page once then lets you go, and the fourth can even go so far as to integrate with a credit card accepting web page before letting people surf. One of them will even block certain ports on the wireless, but I think that&#039;s probably just a function of iptables, right?</p><p>These pieces of software work somehow for somebody. I&#039;m just trying to get the same to work for me.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Codo</strong> on 1 Jul 2005, 20:39)</p>

					<p>Yes I am. I was getting nowhere and shelved the project for the moment becuase I was spending too much time mucking with it. I am still VERY interested in getting this up properly.</p><p>All I&#039;m looking for the &#039;new&#039; WiFi users to see a very simple page that lets them know who is providing the website and to please visit that site when they get a chance (with a link to the site). For this project, I need no authentication or anything fancy. I just need them to be shown a splash page as they hit the &#039;Net.</p><p>Ideally, I would like Wireless Seperation running as well as the folks on the wireless not being able to get to the PC&#039;s on the wired. It would also be nice to have someway (Cron was suggested) to have the wireless be enabled/disabled based upon the store&#039;s open/close hours.</p><p>I didn&#039;t think it would be hard to find what I was looking for, but I was very wrong. ANY help you can give me to get me in the right direction would be GREATLY appreciated.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Right I&#039;m doing the same theing here:</p><p>The reason your getting unrestticted access to the net is becuse the firewall rules are being loaded FIRST from /etc/init.d/S45firewall - which makes it function like an access point. Turning that off (make it unexecutable) start up NoCat with &quot;splashd&quot; and NoCat partly works. As in you can&#039;t access the net without pressing &quot;login&quot; on the splash screen - whats very frustrating is the splash screen doesn&#039;t pop up automatically like it should. For me and a friend at least. if you type</p><p><a href="http://your.router.ip.address">http://your.router.ip.address</a>::5280/?redirect=http://www.piertopier.net</p><p>Up pops the splash a screen, hitting the login button gives you access to the net and divertes you as it should.</p><p>If only I can get the bloomin thing to pop up automatically I have it cracked...</p><p>Poblem MAY be the iptables stuff in NoCat (/usr/lib/NoCatSplash/inicialise.fw) which says has .....&quot;-j REDIRECT --to-port $GatewayPort&quot;.... $GatewayPort is the port the splash screen listens on, and this command fails when you run that script with </p><p>iptables v1.3.1: Unknown arg `--to-port&#039;</p><p>This mabe just beacuse the variable is not getting to it, but its might suspicious too me.....</p><p>Tom</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>oceanhippie</strong> on 29 Jul 2005, 13:58)</p>

You can also pass bandwidth, redirect urls, Staic IPs, Time limits, Data transfer limits etc from the Radius Sever.

I want it to be a custom page because I want to publicise the hotspot among my neighbours and I need a consistent image to make sure they are using my connection and not other peoples connection (to avoid problems).<br />If you can point me to how-tos or resources to get this done, I&#039;ll really appreciate it.<br />Please, keep in mind that I&#039;m a graphic designer and I have little knowledge of *nix (I&#039;m just starting to play with Linux).<br />Thanks in advance.</p><p>Damian</p>									</div>

					<p>I would do somehting like:<br />Set you box up for your home net? I assume it is.<br />enable cron using instuctions here.<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/HowtoEnableCron">http://wiki.openwrt.org/HowtoEnableCron</a><br />install nocat&nbsp; instuctions above or on my website:<br /><a href="http://www.oceanhippie.net/content.php?Cat=1&amp;Res=140">http://www.oceanhippie.net/content.php? … mp;Res=140</a> - ignoring the start up stuff like stoping S45firewall leave that intact, also don&#039;t do the innittab bit eather - for starters it doesn&#039;t work.<br />use the start up script for nocat above, but call it /etc/init.d/nocat - don&#039;t stick an s on the front so it doesn&#039;t start on boot. Saftey first!<br />Then create a cron job at 9:00am pointing to a script something like </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
#PierToPier.net Daytime HotSport Starter Use at own risk!
#Not my fault, you ran it.
# flush firewall rules - nocat has its own
iptables -F INPUT
iptables -F OUTPUT 
iptables -F FORWARD
#turn wep off (insert wireless inteface name for you model) and give it a different ssid
iwconfig [ifnamehere] essid &quot;free hotspot&quot; key off
#start nocat splash
/etc/init.d/nocat start
# end hotpsot start script</code></pre></div><p>then at 5:00 have a cron job run a script like:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
#PierToPier.net Daytime HotSport Stopper Use at own risk!
#Not my fault, you ran it.
#Stop nocat
/etc/init.d/nocat stop
#revert to &quot;Normal&quot; configuration&quot; as stored in NvRam
ifup wifi
wifi up
#sort the firewall out
/etc/init.d/S45firewall</code></pre></div><p>If you want to swich over when your throwing a sicky then just type the stop script or start script by hand as apropriate.</p><p>CAVEAT: the chances are neither of those scripts will actually work. But the concepts sound enought you may have to fiddle a bit. Do the scripts FIRST then when they work to you satisfaction add the cron jobs (pleanty of help on cron on the internet).<br />You could do the same thing with chillispot, nocat can crash on a wrtg sometimes, however it&#039;ll be fine if your going to start and stop it regularly. Chillspot however requires an external radius and you&#039;ll have to get an http server running for it on the ap too. NoCat has its own http server for the splash.</p><p>Oh and if you get it too work do say I&#039;m sure your not the only person who&#039;d want to do somehting like that!</p><p>Tom - Free hotspot 27/7(when I&#039;m not experimenting with it)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>oceanhippie</strong> on 13 Mar 2006, 15:27)</p>

					<p>Guilt set in (finaly) today that for ages the link to my website posted by someone above contains instrcutions on getting NoCat to work which were wrong.....
