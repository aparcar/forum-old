					<p>I have a normally working asterisk v1.8 installation (on my Asus WL-330N3G which is ramips/rt305x) under CC 15.05.1.</p><p>If I install asterisk v11 - keeping my known-to-work settings - it breaks at the very first phone call being attempted through it.<br />All I can do with v11 is opening its&#039; console (CLI). CLI responds with all my settings and looks exactly right: I see all my registrations, etc.</p><p>The *.ipk I used is from the official OpenWrt download site.</p><p>Should I try compiling my own copy of asterisk v11?</p>									</div>
