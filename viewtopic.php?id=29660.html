					<p>Hi,</p><p>I need a set of script that work in this way:<br />1. Boot system;<br />2. Detect interfaces, the associated mac address and put this informations in a file;<br />3. Only for eth0 detect if it can be configued via dhcp or not.<br />4. In according to step 3, rebuild network uci config file automatically.</p><p>To do this i think that the right way is to use hotplug but i have some problem because i&#039;m not able to register a new subsystem &quot;customized&quot; for my hotplug events, but i&#039;m only able to use &quot;net&quot; subsystem to work with my eth devices.</p><p>My hotplug.d structure is:</p><p>/etc/hotplug.d/<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; net<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 01-dhcp_detect<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; platform<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; iface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; customized<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 00-device_detect</p><p>now i want that when a new interface is added are executed before all script in customized subsystem and after the script located in net subsystem in according on normal boot of openwrt.<br />I tried to place another call of &quot;hotplug-call&quot; before the already present in my /etc/init.d/boot but this won&#039;t fix my problem.<br />My hotplug-call seems to be done but $INTERFACE in my 00-device_detect is NULL. Why? Only subsystem net can expect $INTERFACE</p><p>Please help me!</p><p>Rgds</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tonyputi</strong> on 20 Apr 2011, 23:17)</p>
