					<p>Hello there, </p><p>I am trying to build a network traffic collector tool with my WRTG54GL running kamikaze. I am using TCPDump to collect traffic. As I am using the router as a generic hardware platform, I will not need many of the funcionalities that are default of the distribution, like firewall, lan bridging, wireless interface. I am working on verifying what would be the minimum packets required for my application. Basically, I just need to access the three of the four ethernet Interfaces (one for collecting traffic, one for sending the collect data to a remote server and other for management). I have found this forum topic, and I following it on this task:</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=20589">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=20589</a></p><p>If you have any input about the minimum configuration required while building my image, it would be nice. But this is not the main reason of this topic <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I would like to know how can I configure my ethernet interfaces, in order to use three of then to my application. I don´t need the router to behaive as a switch/bridge, just need to configure and be able to access those interfaces individually. I have found some documentation on the network configuration of openwrt, but I still could not figure out on how to perform my task. I am following those pages:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/openwrtdocs/networkinterfaces">http://wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/openwrt … interfaces</a></p><p><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/docs/openwrt.html#x1-80001.2.1">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/d … -80001.2.1</a></p><p>To be honest, I am still reading this documentation ,but if anyone could point me on the right direction, or give me a /etc/config/network example on how to simple configure the interfaces as my needs, I would be very thankfull. </p><p>Also, please let me know if you did not understood my problem, or need more information. </p><p>Thank you!</p><p>- Uderman<br /><a href="http://www.temadigital.com.br">http://www.temadigital.com.br</a>/</p>									</div>
