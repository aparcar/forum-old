					<p>Hi,</p><p>just managed to run Linux (DD-WRT v32 SP1 micro-generic) on a WRT54GS v5.1 (CGN8...).<br />Was as easy as:<br /> - soldering JTAG to the board<br /> - -erase:wholeflash<br /> - -flash:cfe (modified CFE of WAP54G provided on the DD-WRT website)<br /> - tftp the DD-WRT firmware by boot_wait/tftp<br />Running like a charm with lots of features.</p><p>I think OpenWRT would be an even more attractive solution for these cheap devices.<br />Since soldering is _not_ optional, but a must to use Linux on the devices,<br />it is easy to add a serial too, i tested it and it works the same way as with<br />the 4MB-flash WRTs. With this in mind OpenWRT for the WRT54G(S) v5.x series<br />would be the distribution for those of us who know not only a shell but also<br />soldering, electronics and ancient serial RS232 stuff. How much space would be<br />left for packages if a &quot;nano-version&quot; of OpenWRT would be build based on the<br />&quot;micro-version&quot; without:<br /> - telnet and ssh - since we have serial, we can do anything from there<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;also a very &quot;secure&quot; setup, no telnet and ssh at all!<br /> - jffs2 and failsave mode, we have serial - so no need for this<br /> - vi and other big stuff in busybox, we can edit somewhere and wget</p><p>This would also destroy Linksys/Cisco&#039;s attempt to make these cheap end-user<br />router useless for advanced router features like vpn, routing protocols.<br />I think this was one of the major drivers of the 2MB/VxWorks decision,<br />i could not believe that the savings on the chip in contrast to the VxWorks<br />license is that big saver. There also must be other drivers for this effort.</p><p>Axel</p>									</div>

Keep in mind that Linksys volumes are much higher than for Cisco products.<br />All low-end Cisco-Routers, which ship &gt;$1000 can be replaced with WRT54G/OpenWRT features.<br />This is definately a threat for them.</p><p>When the statement in another resent posting is true that the WRT54GSv5.1 comes with 4MB flash/16M RAM,<br />_and_ VxWorks, there could be only reason for doing VxWorks something like this, the reduced bill-of material was an alibi.</p>									</div>
