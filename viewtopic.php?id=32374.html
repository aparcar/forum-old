					<p>Dear developpers and friends users,</p><p>as explained in the post : <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=30680">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=30680</a></p><p>I want to be able to switch on / off the WIFI of my routeur (ASUS WL-500g Premium) with a physical switch (like the already ez-setup button on this specific routeur). The reason of this need is my routeur stay connected without WIFI enabled. And if I need to connect with my smartphone I must need to enable the WIFI by first connecting a computer to switch it on an then off. That sound so stupid and could be solved with a physical WIFI switch like those we can find on some portable computers.</p><p>Somebody already made it on the Oleg firmware. <br /><a href="http://wl500g.info/showthread.php?t=12620">http://wl500g.info/showthread.php?t=12620</a></p><p>1) Do you know if this procedure will work (given code) on the OpenWRT firmware (or please give adapted code),<br />2) Could you please made this point available in the next version of OpenWRT ?</p><p>Sincerely thanks and have a nice day,</p><p>Miguipda ;-)</p>									</div>

					<p>hi guys,</p><p>did anyone manage to set this up on a wl-500gp v2 running RC5?</p><p>I tried wifitoggle package, but doesn&#039;t work.</p><p>Did some debugging and found the followings:</p><p>1.

					<p>Dear basil,</p><p>thanks for your great idea to install wifitoggle package.<br />I did it but still have a little problem.</p><p>After installation it well created the 50-wifitoggle in the /etc/hotplug.d/button folder.</p><p>Then after I installed this new package I rebooted the router.<br />I test it with the ez-setup button and even with the reset one. But both did not react on this pressed button.<br />Then I tested with a long press (15 sec). Nothing changed too.</p><p>Then I read this 50-wifitoggle file and saw the &quot;wps&quot; name was use for this ez-setup button.<br />As I previously tried the Preliminary step (on this page : <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/hardware.button)">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/hardware.button)</a> to see what was the real button name for both ez-setup and reset I discovered the ez-setup button name is &quot;ses&quot;. Then I also tried&nbsp; after having changed the &quot;wps&quot; button name by the &quot;ses&quot; name. And after a reboot it still did not worked. Even the wireless led does switch on or off even the wireless (in Luci) status does change.</p><p>I even read the log file by using the logread command line to see if something was triggered when I pressed those two buttons. Nothing changed.</p><p>Could you please tell me what must I still do to get it work ?</p><p>Another thing. As explained at the end of the Ecample 5 on this link : <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/hardware.button">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/hardware.button</a><br />he proposed to use it with script to allow us to run it to disabling wifi during the time we are sleeping (or gone to work).<br />Then how could I simulate the pressed ez-setup to run your wifitoggle package and get the same script effect (on/off) ?</p><p>Sincerely thanks and have a nice day,</p><p>Miguipda ;-)</p><p>Then was did I missed after having installed this wifitiggle package ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>miguipda</strong> on 20 Oct 2012, 18:12)</p>
