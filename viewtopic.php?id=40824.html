					<p>Hi,<br />I want to add some mass storage to my DIR-615 H1. Unfortunately the device has no USB socket, though the RT3552 chip in this box <a href="http://www.ralinktech.com/en/02_products/product.php?sn=1006"> provides two USB ports </a> ; the kernel also loads usb modules sucessfully. <br />The DIR-620 D1 uses the same chipset and has a USB port (see <a href="http://www.wikidevi.com/w/images/f/fe/DIR-620_rev_D1.jpg">picture</a> )</p><p>Does somebody know if there is some places on the circuit-board of the DIR-615 H1where one could connect a USB device? </p><p>(The second best solution will be an SD-card connected to some GPIO pins but USB would be great!)</p><p>Karsten</p>									</div>
