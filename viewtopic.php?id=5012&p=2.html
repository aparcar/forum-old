					<p>Today I released the first build of the Liberated Libertas firmware that has Busybox 1.2.1 (yes, I finally got it completely working). There have also been a large number of improvements to the firmware this week, and to the buildroot. Things are progressing very rapidly.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I progressed a lot on this project, though I&#039;ve not done as much the last week or so. I needed to take a break as I can&#039;t afford to be working on it obsessively every day, all day.</p><p>The latest firmware is pretty nice, with about 512KB of free, usable space in the JFFS2 partition (more when i switch to squashfs-lzma). BusyBox 1.2.1 is used, so all the latest shell utilities are there, with nice output. I&#039;ve customized much of the code to allow for more capabilities and scripting, including event-driven scripts. Finally, the buildroot is good enough to allow easy extensions and others to join the project, though more work can always be done on it. </p><p>I still haven&#039;t quite figured out client mode yet. Of course, you can use WDS as a &#039;sorta&#039; client mode, but it&#039;s not really the same thing. Similarly, I haven&#039;t got wireless surveys working .. yet. Some custom code may need to be written for this, but I am not sure.</p><p>I plan to try to set up a writable root filesystem using a symlink hack like White Russian does. Everything I need to do it is there, and I&#039;ve started porting the necessary scripts from OpenWrt. </p><p>Really, if this project is to advance more, we need more help. If anyone at all is wanting to join development, let me know and I&#039;ll give you write access to the repository.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry for digging up this post, but is there any chance someone could upload somewhere [ or sent me file on email ] the latest firmware? I mean the latest You&#039;ve done. Those links seems to be dead = /</p>									</div>
