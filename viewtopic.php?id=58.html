					<p>This is a total rewrite of the firewall.sh.&nbsp; This was done in order to support dynamic addition/deletions of interfaces (both LAN and WAN) without resorting to grep/-I &lt;line&gt; guessing.</p><p>Few notes:<br />1) There now is a -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT line.&nbsp; This is to allow loopback<br />2) All -t filter (INPUT/OUTPUT/FORWARD) will DROP any packets not accepted.<br />3) Addition of -A FORWARD -j TCPMSS --clamp-mss-to-pmtu line.&nbsp; I found that using PPPoE, I could not connect to certain sites (probably because they disable ICMP and therefore cannot PMTU properly).&nbsp; This is a HACK (or so the author of TCPMSS claims), but it works (and is also in the stock Linksys firmware - but in a different manner), and will support PPPoE very nicely.<br />4) Addition of LAN-IN/WAN-IN.&nbsp; This is packet terminating ON the router.&nbsp; If you want to provide services on the router itself, do it on WAN-SVC instead.&nbsp; <br />5) Addition of LAN-FWD/WAN-FWD.&nbsp; If you want to disable forwarding of certain packets (NAT&#039;ed or not), insert additional rules here.&nbsp; If you want to provide Port Forwarding, do it on LAN-SVC instead.<br />6) Addition of LAN-SVC/WAN-SVC.&nbsp; LAN-SVC is kind of misleading, its what&#039;s commonly known as port forwarding.&nbsp; Note, there are TWO LAN-SVC, one for -t filter and one for -t nat, and the arguments are different.&nbsp; WAN-SVC is for services that the router is providing.&nbsp; Please look at the examples provided.<br />7) I&#039;ve made it so that both ppp0 and vlan1 are covered.&nbsp; However, it should be that firewall.sh be called to add/delete interface by the correct script (ie. ip-up/default.renew), which is why the ONLY place there is a -i/-o &lt;iface&gt; is on the builtin chain.&nbsp; But since that would require rewriting the support script (networking.sh), it&#039;s the way it is.<br />8) This is currently a drop-in replacement for the existing firewall.sh.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

If you like you could also look at some of the filtering ideas IPCop uses.

The script might decide about the policy upon wether servers are defined or not.</p><br /><br /><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>6) Addition of LAN-SVC/WAN-SVC.&nbsp; LAN-SVC is kind of misleading, its what&#039;s commonly known as port forwarding.&nbsp; Note, there are TWO LAN-SVC, one for -t filter and one for -t nat, and the arguments are different.&nbsp; WAN-SVC is for services that the router is providing.</p></blockquote></div><p>So by SVC you are refering to services? Why not calling it SRV (or server), it might be less ambigous to distinguish LAN-Servers, DMZ-Servers and Router-WAN/LAN-Servers. And be somehow more intuitive that you&#039;d need to inform your firewall about the Servers behind it&nbsp; that you want to be accessible.</p><p>Regards,<br />-Chris</p>									</div>

					<p>Looked some more for prior art on firewall scipts today. At the moment I&#039;d tend to suggest&nbsp; leaving the basic boot firewall.sh script to a bare secure minimum.

That way if you install a sshd it could add a line like &quot;server ssh accept&quot; to say /etc/firehol/lan.interface.</p><br /><p>Onother thing is the wheigt of firehol you mentioned. Of course it takes more space than a mostly hardcoded firewall script. Firehol would strictly only be needed to *re*configure the iptables with it. (saying it could be an ipgk) It is planed that the output of firehols &quot;debug&quot; feature can also be directly used as a startup script.</p><p>OTOH iptables-save and -resotre take up over 100k on my machine, and they are regular i386 striped binaries, not (commented) plain text shell scripts that could possibly be compressed.</p><br /><p>In the FAQ the author writes his personal&nbsp; FireHOL config has 50 lines and:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>These 50 lines produce about 900 iptables statements. For BASH these 900 iptables statements are also followed by another statement to check if the command succeded or failed, which totals to about 1800 BASH statements to be executed.</p></blockquote></div><p>So flash memory requirements may not be that unequal if you compare 50 lines of config plus firehol compressed in cramfs vs. an equally sofisticated but harder to administer firewall startup script.</p><p>-Chris</p>									</div>

					<p>I played around with firehol for a bit, and found it extremely interesting. However, it appears to be very bash specific, and in fact the firehol site refers to a lot of bash features. When I tried to play around with it on my 54g, I got a lot of errors (can&#039;t recall most off the top of my head), including an error with some of the main functions (does bb&#039;s ash support functions?). I haven&#039;t scripted much outside of bash for a long time, so maybe I&#039;m just missing something simple (and I admit I didn&#039;t spend a ton of time on it).</p><p>Ultimately, I think we need a solution that can at least allow NAT port forwarding rules via a web interface (but maybe that&#039;s just me).</p>									</div>
