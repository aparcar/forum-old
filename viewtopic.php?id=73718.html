					<p>Hi!- <br />I am looking for a little guidance and help: <br />I&#039;d really like to get my feet wet this year and learn how to do this or at <br />least learn how to be able to help out.&nbsp; <br />My main goal is to have the ability to build and test on some of my own <br />hardware and play around in my own non production test scenarios at first.&nbsp; <br />My focus and aim is to be able at first&nbsp; build for hardware to be used myself and a tight group of licensed<br />ham radio operators that I know personally<br />Even more specifically: to be able to configure the Atheros radios/chipsets to work on ham frequencies<br />and not be bothering everybody here that is not interested or licensed to use those frequencies.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;d like to get started maybe with something simple like getting ahold of the source and build environments<br />and just compiling known setups that already work so I can see how it all comes together and how I can break things<br />myself and then fix them <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>I have the mind and ability to learn how to do this stuff really well but right now I lack all of the specific experience <br />and much of the specific know-how.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />I am in the process of actually learning my way around C this year as I realize this is key.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Finally...&nbsp; <br />But anyhow yes, and please any suggestions on where to get started?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />I&#039;m also unclear whether to start out with OpenWRT or LEDE or BOTH.<br />As I understand they have come back together again somewhat.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;m a beginner at this but have a pretty good grasp of what needs to be done .&nbsp; </p><p>Thanks...&nbsp; </p><p>Steve</p>									</div>

					<p>I tried to recompile &quot;snapshot&quot; yesterday and was successful to recompile Kernel dependant code and binaries images (WRT3200ACM), I was less successful with &quot;all packages&quot; (still learning)</p><p>My advice:<br />- chose a decent/recent devel platform (I used a derivative of LFS x86_64)<br />- Git clone &#039;current openwrt&#039;<br />- Git checkout -b &quot;mybranch&quot; v17.01.4</p><p>Use this branch to validate your devel platform, generate binaries to<br />flash your target hardware (with a stable code).</p><p>Then, once your devel platform is validated and you have a reference<br />point, you can move to the last release (or current master commit), and start<br />to work out your own code....</p><p>My 2 cents.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks!<br />I&#039;ll be trying out some stuff.&nbsp; <br />Not at all familiar with (any of) the development platform(s) yet or what (all of) the choices may be.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;m assuming there is ample documentation to get me started if I just look.&nbsp; <br />If not or if it&#039;s not obvious where to start *please* give me some help and clues.&nbsp; <br />Otherwise I will definitely find my way to a good starting point pretty quickly.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stevegladden</strong> on 6 Apr 2018, 03:15)</p>
