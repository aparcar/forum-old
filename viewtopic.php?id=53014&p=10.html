From what you’re describing they’ve either got the same bridge chip wired into the micro USB charging port too. I can’t imagine they’d have them wired up together directly (as USB is pretty specific when it comes to trace impedance, etc.) so my guess is they’ve got a MUX chip on the USB data lines from the SD to USB bridge, controlled by the little MCU that handles battery charging/power button duties. When the router is off, the MCU toggles the MUX to direct the USB data lines to the micro USB port instead of the main SoC.</p><p>Even if it was all directly connected together, you still couldn’t use it to directly hook a computer up to the router’s SoC, as the SoC is acting as a USB host, not a device. (Though I’d guess these Ralink SoCs support USB OTG, but that almost always requires a hardware connection which in this case isn’t exposed.)</p><p>TL;DR: No, not feasible.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>timb</strong> on 28 Jul 2015, 11:21)</p>

					<p>Can someone explain why, despite vlan’s being disabled, the router always boots with both an eth0 and eth0.1 interface?

I can get it to route between ethernet and wireless interfaces without any issues. However, one thing i cannot make it do is wireless repeating (ap + sta modes). In the system log i see </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Tue Mar 24 06:41:09 2015 daemon.notice netifd: radio0 (6899): Interface 0 setup failed: BRIDGE_NOT_ALLOWED</code></pre></div><p>I realize that TH-01 is technically not fully supported (thought my understanding hardware is the same..), but just wanted to see if this is specific to this model, or this is generally an issue with TH-02 models too?

					<p>I too am interested in this.&nbsp; I have 2 TM-02&#039;s one i bricked the other i would like to get back to stock ideally through SSH / web gui.&nbsp; I have USB files however i am not sure which TM-02 they came from not sure if that matters or not?</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>ken218 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div class="quotebox"><cite>wingspinner wrote:</cite><blockquote><div class="quotebox"><cite>Preluder wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>can someone help me with reverting the stock firmware back on the TM02?&nbsp; I have all the files from the USB drive. Thanks</p></blockquote></div><p>I&#039;ve tried to write the instructions here twice and the forum keeps logging me before I finish and I loose all my work so I&#039;ll compose offline and then cut and past. In the meantime I&#039;ll leave you with some pointers though....</p><p>1. Connect to the serial console<br />2. Setup a TFTP server (lots of instructions around on how to do that)<br />3. Using uboot and your TFTP server, reprogram the &quot;u-boot&quot; partition with &quot;Bootloader.bin&quot;<br />4. Reboot into the original factory uboot and using that program the &quot;ALL&quot; partition with &quot;ALL.bin&quot;.<br />5. Reboot - you are done</p><p>BTW, it can also be done from the ash command line but it&#039;s a bit more complicated. In short you&#039;d need to do this:</p><p>1. Shutdown the squashFS and run out of a ramdisk<br />2. Using mtd write &quot;Bootloader.bin&quot; to the u-boot MTD partition<br />3. Concantenate Kernel_RootFS.bin + params.bin + user_backup.bin + user.bin + Rootfs.bin into one file using cat<br />4. Useing mtd write that file to the firmware MTD partition<br />5. Reboot</p><p>Ideally, someone could write a short script to do the above but my time is tight and I don&#039;t have time to write it or test it at the moment. I strongly recommend that if one just wants to experiment with OpenWRT that they use a platform that can easily be switched back and forth like RPi or beagle black (I prefer the latter).</p><p>Hope this helps</p></blockquote></div><p>Hi all, </p><p>Has anyone managed to revert back to stock? I am correct to say the first method requires additional hardware (serial console)? I am trying to understand how to revert back to stock without needing additional hardware, but I am stuck even on step one (Shutdown the squashFS and run out of a ramdisk) :S Can someone point me to the right direction if at all possible?</p></blockquote></div>									</div>

					<p>This is a great tutorial.&nbsp; Very easy to upload OpenWRT compared to some other routers I&#039;ve used, thanks to your hard work and documentation.&nbsp; A question - if you were to mod with an external antenna, where would you attach the lead and braid of the coax?&nbsp; I&#039;m interested in trying to max out the range in the same way others have done for the TP-Link WR703n:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=46543">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=46543</a></p><p>I understand linux and openwrt pretty well, but I know very little about antenna design.<br />Thanks for any thoughts.</p>									</div>
