					<p>Hey everyone,</p><p>I&#039;m very new to this and decided to play around with my wrtsl54gs since i didn&#039;t think i would need it anymore.

I&#039;ve now realized i will need the router so I&#039;m trying to flash whiterussian onto the router and am having trouble.</p><p>The router won&#039;t access the internet so I set my pc up as a web server and i am trying to using ssh to flash via the command line</p><p>wget <a href="http://192.168.1.223/openwrt-bcrm-2.4-squashfs.trx">http://192.168.1.223/openwrt-bcrm-2.4-squashfs.trx</a><br />mtd -r write openwrt-bcrm-2.4-squashfs.trx linux</p><p>wget always returns connection failure due to timeout, I have no firewall running on the computer and a browser can access the web server no problem. I&#039;m using putty to ssh, apache 2.2 to run the web server and the os is vista. Does anyone know if there are any permissions to change in vista to allow the router to access the pc or if I just doing something incorrectly?</p>									</div>
