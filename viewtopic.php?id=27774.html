					<p>Hello Guys,</p><p>i am fairly new to OpenWRT, so I hope to find some help here.<br />I would like to use an alternate firmware on my Arcor Easybox A300 WLAN.</p><p>I resetted my EasyBox and by Accessing it via HTTP, a Recovery-Tool opened. Here some Information:<br />Boot Loader / Tiny Kernel Version: V0.67.6 </p><p>This Tool Allows me to Upgrade my Firmware and/or Bootloader.</p><p>Could you tell me, what file i should use?&nbsp; I Have tried some files from here (<a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/newest/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/newest/</a>) to basicly install SquashFS on my router without success. It allways tells me &quot;File verification failed&quot;.</p><p>(Well, i was searching you wiki and some other pages and as far a I have come with that, there is no posibility to run OpenWRT on this Router. Is this really true?)</p>									</div>
