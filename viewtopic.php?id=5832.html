					<p>I&#039;ve been struggling to cross compile linux-igd for wrt54gs router. </p><p>Using the buildroot docs, I managed to set up the environment, wrote a simple hello world C program that cross compiled and ran fine on the router. </p><p>I&#039;m not sure how to go about with linux-igd package (which also depends on upnpsdk):<br /><a href="http://linux-igd.sourceforge.net/documentation.php">http://linux-igd.sourceforge.net/documentation.php</a></p><p>I&#039;ve copied the upnpsdk and linux-igd source folders into package directory of the buildroot. I should get upnpsdk cross compiled first, followed by linux-igd.</p><p>Could some one please tell me what I need to do to build these two? I&#039;m not very familiar with cross compilation and linux, so request you to&nbsp; use simple language.</p><p>Some attempts I made:<br />1) In linux-igd&#039;s makefile, I found a variable CC=g++, which I replaced with stagingdir/bin/mipsel-linux-uclibc-g++&nbsp; . I couldnt test this since it depends on upnpsdk.</p><p>2) In&nbsp; upnpsdk&#039;s makefile, I found a line &quot;MAKE = make&quot; (and MAKE is being used to compile the code). I&#039;m not sure how to modify this.</p><p>Looking forward to your replies.</p>									</div>
