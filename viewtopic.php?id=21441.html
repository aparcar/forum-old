					<p>I&#039;m having an issue with this procedure on a Dlink DIR-320 with brcm-2.4-generic built with the required options to locate the flash in the required address and enabling USB.</p><br /><br /><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
boot_dev=&quot;/dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part1&quot;
for module in usbcore ehci-hcd scsi_mod sd_mod usb-storage jbd ext2 ext3 ; do {
        insmod $module
}; done
sleep 4s

mount -t ext3 &quot;$boot_dev&quot; /mnt
 [ -x /mnt/sbin/init ] &amp;&amp; {
        mount -o move /proc /mnt/proc &amp;&amp; \

                mount -o move /mnt/sys /sys 2&gt;&amp;-
        }
 }</code></pre></div><p>When executing this script I get the following message:<br />mount: /proc is not a block device</p><p>It would seem to me there&#039;s something wrong with the mount to move to /proc link across. Whilst I know that the /proc isn&#039;t a block device - how do we move it? </p><p>The USB key has been partitioned and formatted along with the files copied across as per the instructions. A directory of /proc exists on the USB key and is empty. As such, there doesn&#039;t seem to be a problem with accessing the USB key.</p><p>Can anyone shed any light onto what the problem might be?</p>									</div>

					<p>Still stuck on this one. I was playing around with my WRT54GV2 that has X-wrt 8.09 on it and it behaved as expected. I could move to system across to the sdcard as per the instructions.<br />The binary was downloaded from the X-wrt site whereas the binary for the DIR320 was compiled by myself. Something to do with 8.09.1 or my build? Since I&#039;m getting desperate, I&#039;ll try compiling 8.09.</p>									</div>
