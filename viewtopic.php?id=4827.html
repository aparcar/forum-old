					<p>After i´ve flashed the openWrt i noticed that the cisco button on my v4 wrt54gs wasn´t been used for nothing, so i had some ideas for the developers: why not assign to the cisco logo button a script, ie: if you hit the button, the wrt unit send a magic packet for every mac adresses in a list. ex: waking up all computers in a network at once, or if you hold the button for, lets say, 2 seconds the unit boots.<br />Another good idea is the unit make periodically tests on the internet, if the internet is working properly the cisco logo goes white, if not, goes yellow, if the unit is authenticating a pppoe session it blinks. The button is a valuable help in diagnostic and could help easing some processes.</p><p>I would like to congratulate the people behind the development of this great firmware, you´re doing a great job. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
