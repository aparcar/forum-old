					<p>I just upgraded to Chaos Calmer from an earlier OpenWRT version.

PPTP now works again, and it turns out that the iptables rule above is unnecessary.&nbsp; Installing the packages was a bit tricky, though:</p><p>I had previously done an update of the opkg package files through luci. However, when I did:</p><p>&nbsp; opkg update</p><p>on the command line, I suddenly could install kmod-gre.</p><p>To install kmod-nf-nathelper-extra, I had to manually download that package and kmod-lib-textsearch from:</p><p>&nbsp; <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05-rc3/ar71xx/generic/packages/base/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal â€¦ ages/base/</a></p><p>I guess something is weird with the package lists...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mdjurfeldt</strong> on 5 Aug 2015, 23:26)</p>
