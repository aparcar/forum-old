					<p>Hello everybody,</p><p>does anyone know whether generic 10.03.1-rc5 or rc6 ar71xx firmware images for Routerstation contain RedBoot bootloader? If RedBoot is included, which version is it in? I&#039;ve read that RouterStation had serious performance problems in the past and Ubiquiti repaired it by some changes in its bootloader.</p><p>Thanks for your responses.</p><p>awm</p>									</div>
