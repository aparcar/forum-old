					<p>Thanks for you reply nebbia88:<br />Actually it&#039;s the MR3040 that has a quasi wisp client option, but it&#039;s not intended in the traditional WISP sense the TP-LINK will act as a client repeater and not like a professional cpe like airos.<br />The cpe in the link I posted does have those features, but I don&#039;t have the skills to flash from vxworks prompt.</p><p>thanks again</p>									</div>

					<p>I think it is v1 hw, but I can see the working mode menu when I use mr3040 fw.<br />what I was saying is that even when this mr3040 fw is capable of wireless client mode it is simply not as good as air os or even wr543g which are real cpe firmwares.<br />Do you know of any other 4Mb flash AR9331 cpe outhere? as those are easy to modify using the windows utility to fix header and checksum.<br />thanks for your time and effort</p>									</div>

					<p>To get back to the original question.<br />Does anyone her have some idea how to flash a firmware from the vxworks propt?<br />I&#039;m sure it can&#039;t be that hard, its simply a matter of being a closed source software that there is not a whole lot of information about it on the net.<br />thanks again</p>									</div>
