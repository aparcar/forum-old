					<p>My numbers could be off here, but appears the the 1900ac Version 1 patch works about 50% of the time.&nbsp; For the Version1 folks that are still having reboot issues, please give <strong>DD-WRT</strong> a try.&nbsp; Also, for those who still own the Version 1, I recommend buying the ACS or ACM as there can be really good deals on Ebay, if one stays patient and snipes at the end of a sale <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />&nbsp; Kernel 4.14 will likely be coming out before too long, but if it isn&#039;t stable on the V1, who knows how long it will take before there is a fix in.... if ever. My experience with the ACM has been really good since the wifi drivers have been honed a bit, and I do know Linksys is continuing to add wifi features that will probably only be available on the 3200acm I.E. MU-MIMO for example. One disadvantage, some might have a issue with, is that in the USA one can not mess with the wifi power output. </p><p>For Transmission packages ---&nbsp; &nbsp;If the packages are not in the repository then they are failing to build. I&#039;m currently working on a new build, and I&#039;ll take a look to see what might be happening with them. It&#039;s likely they will fail to compile today, but I&#039;ll reach out to the package maintainer and maybe he/she will give some insight as to why they are failing. My opinion doesn&#039;t count because I believe we should all use our routers the way we see fit, but I don&#039;t recommend using your router as a BitTorrent client <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />&nbsp; &nbsp;If you want, as soon as a build is available one can grab those needed transmission packages from daily lede snapshot builds.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey All. Someone posted a couple pages back about there being a &quot;wide-scale&quot; issue (Linksys says about 0.5% of install base) with the WRT-3200ACM and WRT-32X; just wanted to make this forum aware of the issue. Most people complain about their wireless just &quot;not working&quot;, requiring a reboot to correct, and even then not for long.</p><p>Personally, I experienced the issue running Davidc502&#039;s build of LEDE, stable LEDE, and stock. Currently, the finger is being pointed at Google&#039;s Chromecast/Android KRACK patch as the primary suspect. I have also seen articles about Netgears having issues and can confirm that with my parents&#039; router.</p><p>More specific symptoms for me were:<br />1) 5GHz network randomly disappearing, sometimes coming back, usually not<br />2) 2.4GHz network dropping all clients and refusing reconnects<br />3) Chromecast devices do not show in the list of available Cast destinations and cannot be managed via the Google Home app (My one Chromecast on Ethernet <em>usually</em> works, but not always)</p><p>Disabling the 5GHz has made my 2.4GHz stable again but has done nothing for Chromecast availability. If you care to follow along or contribute what you can, the official thread is here:<br /><a href="http://community.linksys.com/t5/Wireless-Routers/WRT32x-and-WRT3200ACM-WiFi-Issues/td-p/1246764/">http://community.linksys.com/t5/Wireles … p/1246764/</a><br />and is being moderated by a dedicated community team member: Linksys_Lucas<br />His most recent update (<a href="http://community.linksys.com/t5/Wireless-Routers/WRT32x-and-WRT3200ACM-WiFi-Issues/m-p/1253925#M344886">http://community.linksys.com/t5/Wireles … 25#M344886</a>) said they might be close to a workaround, but permanent fix will rely on cooperation from </p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>&quot;the other parties&quot; (which is what I will call the 3rd party groups we are working with to isolate the issues)</p></blockquote></div>									</div>

Because I had the same issue with Luci so far. Two times, when I opened Luci, the same second, the router rebooted. I am certain, that there is something wrong with the memory on these routers (this rom). Maybe the memory is wrongly clocked and overclocked with kernel 4.9, leading to rare memory corruptions. For example, my router hasnt rebooted anymore, since I deactivated a script of mine. It is a self written watchdog for OpenVPN, and it uses &quot;sleep 20&quot; in it. I had two times now this in the logs:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[318506.951336] BUG: Bad page map in process sleep  pte:00060000 pmd:1bd74831</code></pre></div><p>Since I deactivated the watchdog script, the router has not rebooted anymore. The sleep is triggered every 20 seconds in the script, which might cause a memory corruption way sooner than not using the script.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makedir</strong> on 30 Dec 2017, 02:55)</p>

					<p>Hi, newbie thinking of trying a wrt1900acv2 build.&nbsp; Did not see a search for specific build issues for the ACV2 but it seems the ACV1 is or has been a problem child. Since this thread is fairly huge, i figured just ask 1st, as i have a good idea on how to install and remove if needed.</p><p>I also have another question... is it me or just an oddity with ACSV1 build being about the same size as the ACV2, so is there minor partion differences between them since hardware is the same? I noticed a bunch of factory refurbished ACV2&nbsp; being unloaded below $90 and the ACSV2 routers below $110.</p>									</div>
