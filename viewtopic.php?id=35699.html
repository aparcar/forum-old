					<p>Hi,</p><p>Sometimes when debugging network problems, I use an old ethernet hub to tap into the network traffic of another computers and record it with Wireshark. Can I configure OpenWrt to do the same, just with fast ethernet? I.e., I would like to connect the computer to the LAN through the OpenWrt router and receive a copy of all of its network traffic on my computer running Wireshark connected to a third interface of the router?</p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mforkel</strong> on 22 Mar 2012, 18:23)</p>
