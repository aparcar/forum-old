					<p>I&#039;m enjoying my second day with OpenWrt, everything seems stable and sensibly arranged. I&#039;m also enjoying that buying a new router as a low power server still seems the right choice for my purposes. However...</p><p>While I&#039;ve quickly achieved the main goal of only allowing internet access via privoxy to lan clients, I can&#039;t disable forwarding / upstreaming DNS requests in Dnsmasq (using option noresolv &#039;1&#039;) without knocking out Privoxy&#039;s ability to resolve internet / wan addresses.</p><p>I&#039;ve looked hard though the documentation but couldn&#039;t find an option in privoxy to specify the DNS server it uses, this would be the most obvious solution since privoxy could connect to my ISPs DNS and local clients looking to resolve local addresses can be served by dnsmasq without also allowing resolution of uncontactable hosts.</p><p>Given that the above may be impossible without forwarding the entire connection to another proxy I wondered if Dnsmasq could be configured to not forward / upstream DNS requests to connections from &#039;lan&#039; but do so on requests from the host itself and therefore allow Privoxy to resolve wan addresses.</p><p>Just in case this is relevant to options, my secondary goal for this box is to redirect some web traffic to a self contained webserver.&nbsp; I&#039;ve not got to this bit yet but potentially there&#039;s a OpenWrt package which fulfils this plus being a suitable proxy... might be relevant, never know!</p><p>If anyone has any suggestions I&#039;d be most interested.</p>									</div>

					<p>* privoxy is more for local proxies ...Are you using it for a internet proxy ?!? Use something like dansguardian/squid setup as a transparent proxy this will solve all yer problems... also for extra points setup mirror port in OpenWRT and send the traffic to something like Security Onion.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># incoming packets (ignore packets from local subnet)

Heres is the idea first dns is what ever is real DNS and second is for the privoxy server so it searches in that order but here is some script for client side IP setting in windows that includes DNS entries.</p><br /><p>static IP set<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>c:\windows\System32\ipconfig.exe /release
