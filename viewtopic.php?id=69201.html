					<p>Hi, first of all I want to say hi to all users.<br />I made hardware mod to this router, pulling out d+ and d- signals from cpu. But i have troubles with firmware. On original openwrt usb is not working. I found that if i want to get usb working I must add:<br />ath79_register_usb(); <br />function to&nbsp; firware and recompile. But at this point things get tough. I searched internet, installed linux, get all openwrt git.<br />I can select my router and so on, but i have no idea what to add this function to image. Maybe someone made this mod already and has all firware compiled? Or maybe someone can explain to me what to do this?<br />Best regards and sorry for engrish.</p>									</div>
