					<p>Hi, I&#039;m having a little problem. After a reflash I can telnet/ssh into the WRT54G. However, after I go into the browser, I get locked out of telnet/ssh. I&#039;m not sure why this is happening? I tried reflashing back to the Linksys firmware and then back after, but the same thing happens. As long as I don&#039;t play with the web browser I&#039;m safe though. Should I be trying a different firmware version? If anyone could help or knows a fix it would be appreciated.</p><p>Info:<br />LINKSYS WRT54G v2.0<br />OpenWRT White Russian 4 - openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-I&#039;ve tried the downloaded one off the website<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-I compiled my own<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-Both have the same problem<br />Tried both Internet Explorer and Firefox<br />Tried both WinXP Prof and Fedora Core 4</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s not happening through telnet. I change the password through webif. I&#039;m then locked out of telnet. Which I understand. However, the password I setup through webif, does not work for ssh.</p>									</div>

					<p>Strange, for me it does.<br />I set the password via <strong>webif</strong> and then I flawlessly connect via Tectia&#039;s SSH client.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, after many reflashes the problem seems to have gone away. Must have been something I was doing wrong during setup. Sorry for the post.</p>									</div>
