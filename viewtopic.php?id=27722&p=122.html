					<p>Perhaps I&#039;m a bit slow tonight, but I hadn&#039;t updated my build in awhile (3 month&#039;s or so) and I was used to configuring minidlna via /etc/minidlna.conf. But I couldn&#039;t find that file once I updated to the latest fat version, so I came searching here and came across the post that said minidlna.conf was depreciated by the luci app. That&#039;s cool and all, but I don&#039;t get any luci config page in the fat build and I don&#039;t really want to grab the luci-app minidlna package from the trunk if it has a dependency on the older minidlna that regular backfire builds use, rather than the cvs in the arokh build.</p><p>Hope this made sense and someone can point me in the right direction lol.</p>									</div>

					<p>Since today I need to use the miniDLNA server, for my TV. Now my problem is that some mkv&#039;s get discovered automatically instantly, some others do not get recognized at all. I have no clue why, as they do work through the Windows 7 Media Player DLNA server. Anyone got any pointers on it? If there is a better forum place to ask this, please redirect me if you know of it. The problem I have could be Arokh isolated, but it could of course be a more generic problem.</p><p>I am using the latest standard build.</p><p>EDIT:<br />If I delete the db file that MiniDLNA makes at first and disable/reenable MiniDLNA through Luci, then it does recognize these files.

					<p>Well, I am certain it is a bug with MiniDLNA, I made a script named &quot;refresh&quot; and put it in the bin folder with the following code:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>#!/bin/sh<br /># Copyright (C) 2006-2011 OpenWrt.org</p><p>killall minidlna<br />sleep 5<br />minidlna -R -f /var/minidlna.conf</p></blockquote></div><p>This refreshes the db file, after that all added mkv&#039;s I have added are recognized. If you have a large library this will be a hassle, though in my case (I use it mainly to watch TV shows that come out here so darn late) I only have 15 files on it tops. So, every time I have unrared an episode of something downloaded with transmission, I run the refresh script and voilá! I can stream it on my TV.</p><p>While this works and isn&#039;t that much of a problem in my case, I still think it is a bug with the package. Though I might be wrong of course <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>So, I guess I should make a ticket? Never done that, will try now <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Well, after all, it seems that there is a problem with the OpenWRT installed on my router.</p><p>I am still unable to connect to the Internet from any workstation, setup with different Linux O/Ses!</p><p>I now think the problem is with the raw install of the &quot;fat&quot; version of this community build of OpenWRT.</p><p>The symptoms and what I have done:</p><p>1. My previous post indicates that I thought the problem may have been with my workstation setup. However after having endlessly fiddled with the various network/interfaces settings on my workstation. I decided to try with other workstations. I got exactly the same problem. Unable to connect to the Internet. So it does not work for at least three different Linux installs on two different physical workstations (Crunchbang on my main one, and Peppermint and Zenix on the second workstation).</p><p>2. I have tried different ports on the router. No joy!</p><p>3. I have used the reset to default (including the password, so that worked) and leaving all settings, except password and timezone, as they were following the reset, thus firewall untouched. No joy again!</p><p>4. Obviously the workstations can connect to the router I get into the Lucy GUI without problems. All of the Lucy screens (I tried them all, whic made me even keener to get it working), seem to be working and have apparently &quot;reasonable&quot; information.</p><p>5. The firewall status does show some traffic in some of the rules, but that maybe traffic initiated from the router (since the traffic is very light after a reset and then no Internet connection).</p><p>6. I could not find where the dns information is hiding itself. As it is, my isp provide a dns that is supposedly set automatically with the connection. I have that info or I could use a public dns server but I thought that this ought to have worked out of the box, without adjustment, so I have made no change.</p><p>I am, now simply at a loss, stumped and flabbergasted! I would simply love to be able to use OpenWRT and as my router a WNDR3800 is working with stock firmware and with DD-WRT (which I tried before deciding to give OpenWRT a shot), I don&#039;t think there is any issue with the hardware.</p><p>I am not discouraged and would really like to have this build of OpenWRT working but ... this is taking a long time, rather precious to me, and I have no more idea about what to do. Has anyone got any suggestion on how to move this forward.&nbsp; Could I give any information that may be useful in resolving this? If so, what is it that is needed.</p><p>Thanks in advance to anyone able and willing to help.</p>									</div>

Ping an external IP address (not DNS name) from your router. If it doesn&#039;t work, the problem is with the connection. If it does work, try to ping the same address from your workstation. If that doesn&#039;t work, the problem is with the firewalling rules. Start with the basics, make sure you can reach the outside world and that the firewall is properly forwarding packets.</p><p>I doubt the issue is with the fat build, as it&#039;s built from the same tree with a slightly different package set.</p>									</div>
