					<p>Hello all!<br />I&#039;m new to OpenWRT and installed it on an Alix 2c2 board. Since I don&#039;t have a Linux computer available, I just downloaded the Compact Flash image and copied t to the CF card using dd2 for Windows. Everything went successfull and the system boots. Now, I&#039;ve got a problem: under /etc/conf/network I wanted to config eth0. I only changed the IP address from $ip to 192.168.1.1 and also rebooted the device afterwards.However, ifconfig eth0 just gives me an error saying it codn&#039;t find the interface. Also ifconfig eth1 doesn&#039;t work. I connected the embedded PC to my laptop and tried to ping it, bu no success. Only interface available is the loopback. Can anyone help please? Thanks!!!<br />Robin</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi again,<br />can&#039;t anyone help me with this? Sorry for being impatient, but I really need this device. I&#039;ve seen that actually it is no problem to get OpenWRT running, just download and copy the image to the CF card, boot from it and the interfaces work. However, this really isn&#039;t the case here. Please help!<br />Robin24</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello...<br />Excuse me, but doesn&#039;t anybody here have an idea of how to solve my problem? I see this is a very special issue thatdoesn&#039;t occur often, but isn&#039;t there a way of just loading the network interface modules? I mean, it can&#039;t be that hard! I&#039;m a Linux newbie unfortunately, but I think it can&#039;t be that difficult to just start the interfaces up. Please, if anyone knows where I could start, let me know!

					<p>Hi Sam,<br />how&#039;s the image coming along? :-) I just wanted to ask because yesterday you told me to remind you if you hadn&#039;t uploaded it to your server in the evening. Well, I don&#039;t know what timezone you&#039;re in, here in Switzerland it&#039;s 20:50 PM now. Sorry if this is coming to early for you, I just can&#039;t wait to get it working because the 14 days after I purchased it and can still send it back are almost over and I wanna send it back if it doesn&#039;t work...
