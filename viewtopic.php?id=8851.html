					<p>Hi everybody,</p><p>as my WL-HDD has a PDC20265, I tried to install the appropriate driver to use my CF card again (somewhat embarrassing, as I had all of this working already some hundred revisions earlier, but I can&#039;t remember how <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /> ).</p><p>Anyway, what happens is this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>PDC20265: IDE controller at PCI slot 0000:01:01.0
PCI: Enabling device 0000:01:01.0 (0004 -&gt; 0007)
PCI: Fixing up device 0000:01:01.0
PDC20265: chipset revision 2
PDC20265: ROM enabled at 0x40020000
PDC20265: 100% native mode on irq 6
PDC20265: (U)DMA Burst Bit DISABLED Primary PCI Mode Secondary PCI Mode.
PDC20265: FORCING BURST BIT 0x00-&gt;0x01 ACTIVE

    ide3: BM-DMA at 0x0148-0x014f, BIOS settings: hdg:pio, hdh:pio
Probing IDE interface ide2...
ide2: Wait for ready failed before probe !
Probing IDE interface ide3...</code></pre></div><p>After &quot;Probing IDE interface ide2...&quot;, there&#039;s a LONG pause during which the entire device hangs. But why is the driver probing for ide2/3 instead of 0/1? In the boot log from somebody else, I saw that ide0/1 is definitely correct and works. Perhaps disabling DMA could work?</p><p>Florian</p>									</div>
