					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have an <a href="http://www.smc.com/index.cfm?event=viewProduct&amp;cid=1&amp;scid=4&amp;localeCode=EN_USA&amp;pid=1072">SMC Barricade SMC7804WBRA</a> wireless broadband router. I&#039;ve been experiencing problems with the latest official firmware (v0.85), which was released some years back.</p><p>Now I would like to know if it&#039;s possible to upgrade an OpenWRT or DD-WRT firmware to my router, but haven&#039;t received any clear answer so far.</p><p>Here is what I personally know about my router hardware at the moment:<br />CPU: ARM0403 (Samsung S3C2510A01)<br />Wireless: Intersil 3880IK MiniPCI chip<br />SDRAM: 16MB (IC42S16400-7T)<br />Flash: 2MB (AM29LV160MB-90EI)</p><p>Here are some pictures of the hardware:<br /><a href="http://img355.imageshack.us/my.php?image=smc7804wbrahwny2.jpg">http://img355.imageshack.us/my.php?imag … ahwny2.jpg</a><br /><a href="http://img440.imageshack.us/my.php?image=smc7804wbradn7.jpg">http://img440.imageshack.us/my.php?imag … bradn7.jpg</a></p><p>So, do you guys think it might be possible to get either OpenWRT or some other open source firmware to work in this router?</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Kaltsu</strong> on 11 Sep 2008, 17:32)</p>
