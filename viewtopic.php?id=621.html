					<p>Hey everyone,</p><p>I&#039;ve been lurking for a week or two and have read most of the posts since, say, Oct 1st or so.</p><p>There&#039;s one thing I&#039;d like further details on.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to set up a secure (SSL) web server with decent scripting capability.&nbsp; &nbsp; Ideally, a mysql client would tie into this, but that&#039;s not top priority right now.</p><p>A lot has been said over the past month about various combinations (php, haserl, etc) but I haven&#039;t found a strong consensus and I haven&#039;t found a combination that includes SSL support.</p><p>Anyone have a suggestion?</p>									</div>
