					<p>Hi, I&#039;m trying to get avahi-daemon to be run under the supervision of procd for auto respawning purposes.&nbsp; </p><p>I have tried modifying the init file for avahi to include procd support, but it doesn&#039;t seem to work and fails without any messages as to why (/etc/init.d/avahi-daemon start returns immediately and process doesn&#039;t start).</p><p>1. Does anyone have an idea of why avahi is not already configured with procd support?&nbsp; Curious for my understanding on this one.<br />2. I tried modifying inittab to start avahi with respawning capability since I can&#039;t seem to get procd to work with avahi-daemon.&nbsp; This works, but when it first starts avahi, avahi crashes multiple times due to the fact that ubus is not already started.&nbsp; Eventually this works because the respawning occurs until ubus is ready and the avahi eventually stays executing.&nbsp; What is the right approach in order to accomplish avahi-daemon with respawning capabilities?&nbsp; Procd or inittab?</p>									</div>
