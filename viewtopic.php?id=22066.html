					<p>Found today interessting article on slashdot.org... Looking for a WRT - GIGABIT ethernet router which can do the following:</p><p>-VLAN<br />-VPN<br />-SSHD<br />-ICP DHCP (where I can change dhcpd.conf)<br />-Firewall with Port Forwarding<br />- MUST BE VERY STABLE</p><p>Now I was looking over hours for a &#039;WRT&#039; compatible gigabit device, no chance to find one. Can someone here recommend me something, would Netgear WNR3500L be a good choice to wait for?</p><p>Also, when I drop the gigabit requirement, which would be the best router for me?</p><p>Many thanks in advance!</p><p>-- Zeno</p>									</div>

I think the WNR3500L does look like worth waiting for, although reviews about Netgear&#039;s &#039;antenna&#039; technology has gotten mixed reviews (they don&#039;t really use antennas but some type of print on the circuit board itself). The above link says WPA(2) isn&#039;t working yet but wireless is, let&#039;s hope by the time it pops up in Europe WPA2 will be supported, otherwise it&#039;s as good as useless as a wireless AP...</p>									</div>

					<p>I dunno I suspect this is another Atheros-based reference designs like WRT610n and a lot of others.&nbsp; Some of these it&#039;s been trouble getting the switch working.&nbsp; Then when you get past that there is the WiFi drivers all over again just like Broadcom.&nbsp; The Ath9K driver is loaded with problems.&nbsp; It would be lovely to see a router that&#039;s REALLY open but I suspect they mean they&#039;ll hand you a black-box driver blob which only works with certain kernels.</p>									</div>

					<p>This is a broadcom 4718 Soc based 947xx platform. The wifi driver is binary only but at least dd-wrt kernel 2.6 works on this router (with the WiFi). I am trying to get some patches out for OpenWRT brcm47xx target. The patches for brcm-2.4 targets are already available in myopenrouter.com</p>									</div>

					<p>I am doing my own research as well to get openwrt to run with dd-wrt kernel and have made some progress.<br />I have been assisted by dd-wrt team&#039;s leader - I am trying to get wrt610n working with openwrt and dd-wrt kernel 2.6 - this should outcome a working router with wifi(also n) and wired.
