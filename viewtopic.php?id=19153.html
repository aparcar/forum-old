					<p>I have a NSLU2 running on a old trunk build of openwrt 7.09 and now that 8.09 is out I thought it was a good time to upgrade.</p><p>Being a good boy I made a backup of the old flash image and also put some files and other stuff on my NAS in the network.<br />Then I used upslug2 from my main linux machine to flash the 8Mb squashfs image from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09/ixp4xx/openwrt-nslu2-squashfs.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8 â€¦ uashfs.bin</a></p><p>Everything looks good and the device reboots and then .... nothing.</p><p>The ethernet led stays on, all other leds are off and I can not reach the device on any IP that I could think of. I tried the DHCP IP that my (openwrt) router had given out when it received a DHCP address but that did not respond. I tried 192.168.1.77 (doing a route add 192.168.1.77 eth0 on my linux machine) but nothing. I tried 192.168.1.1 but also nothing.</p><p>Then I went ahead and reflashed the device to the stock standard linksys firmware (using the instructions from nslu2-linux.org website) and the machine worked immediatly (on the standard 192.168.1.77 IP). I did a &quot;retore default settings&quot; from the web interface and let the device reboot. I entered a fixed IP in my own range into the device and rebooted it. I could then access it on this new IP without problems but still using the standard linksys firmware.</p><p>Then I did a reflash of the openwrt 8.09 nslu2 firmware (after checking the md5sum just to exclude any download problems) and again, the same issue. Device boots, requests a IP address via DHCP and then just sits there with only the ethernet led burning. Again any methode of trying to access the device fails. Even nmap does not see it.</p><p>So what am i not doing correctly? what is the magic trick to make this 8.09 nslu2 firmware work?</p><p>Hein</p>									</div>

					<p>I have not tried the latest&nbsp; stock image file, but have 3 NSLU2s flashed with post-RC2 images built with the make menuconfig build process.&nbsp; For past stock images, I found that the default ip address, 192.168.1.1, conflicted with my router--and also that the NSLU2 itself tried to be a DHCP server.&nbsp; To get around that problem I directly linked my PC &amp; the slug with a crossover cable, gave the PC a static IP address (a pain), and then was able to connect to the slug on 192.168.1.1 and go in and change the ip in /etc/config/network and also disable whatever was providing DHCP--I think maybe dmask.</p>									</div>

					<p>That was what I forgot, the standard openwrt image does not behave like a &quot;normal&quot; nslu2 but tries to be a router :-)<br />That was exactly what I had disabled in my own builds (but that was also more then a year ago).</p><p>So I did : </p><p>* /etc/init.d/dnsmasq disable&nbsp; (to turn dnsmasq off)<br />* /etc/init.d/firewall disable (to turn the firewall off)<br />* vi /etc/config/network to swith lan from static to dhcp and put a # infront of type</p><p>reboot and all was well</p><p>:-)</p>									</div>
