					<p>Hello,</p><p>I bought some device from China with OpenWRT pre-installed. Unfortunately, when I tried to install some software on it, it did not go thru...</p><p>I decided to install another version of OpenWRT and it bricked the router because the wifi was not supported.<br />As far as I understood the Chinese are using Openwrt.com.cn and OpenWRT.com does not manage this kind of chipset yet.</p><p>I tried to unbrick the device by SERIAL connection but when I got connected nothing appear in English it was a weird language with some stuff in Chinese sometimes...</p><p>If some has an idea about how I can burn the initial firmware it will be awesome !</p>									</div>
