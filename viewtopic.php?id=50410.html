					<p>Hello all - <br />I am selling my Fonera 2.0n, which has OpenWRT firmware already installed.&nbsp; <br />The router worked perfectly before my installation, but I am a newbie, and I think I entered some information that I shouldn&#039;t have, because I can&#039;t seem to get the connections I had before I replaced the firmware. I can see the OpenWRT signal being broadcast, but can&#039;t seem to get in.&nbsp; I can even get the router into the failsafe mode of OpenWRT, through which to telnet and try to reinstall a fresh firmware, but I can&#039;t seem to successfully connect the telnet session to accomplish the reinstall. </p><br /><p>If anyone is interested, I followed the folks on this forum. Although it was working just fine - I played with some settings, and now can&#039;t undo what I have done!&nbsp; <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=22371">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=22371</a></p><br /><p>Anyhow, I&#039;d love to trade the router -&nbsp; or happy to sell the router if nobody wants to trade -&nbsp; &nbsp;at whatever is a fair price.</p>									</div>

					<p>Do you have serial console? If not solder the pins and issue the following command: firstboot - it will reset all the settings. <br />Here are the pinouts: <a href="http://www.flanesi.it/blog/2011/04/17/fonera-2-0n-hardware-e-potenzialita/">http://www.flanesi.it/blog/2011/04/17/f … enzialita/</a><br />Good luck.<br />I can do that for you if you pay shipping both ways + 10Euro for the soldering and other work.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you made a bad config, you should be able to reset the router. If you uploaded a wrong firmware then you have to have a serial or jtag cable depending on the router. How do you know that you can enter failsafe mode when you cannot connect to the router? Also try telnet instead of ssh. SSH is not enabled on openwrt until you change the root password. If you tried reseting the router, then the password is gone, and you can connect only via telnet. When you set a pass the telnet is disabled, and ssh enabled.</p><p>The best way to get access to the console as I mentioned above is to have a serial cable (you can buy FDTI cable for 3-4$) and you need some soldering skills - see the link I gave you. </p><p>If you cannot do it by yourself my offer stands.</p>									</div>

Fonera shouldrestart then. If not unplug it and plug it back.<br />All done.<br />Set your pc IP back to automatic (dhcp).<br />Open web browser and go to 192.168.10.1<br />You can then update the firmware of the router to the latest version.</p><p>If you want openwrt then you will need to update to a developer firmware first. <br />Download this file to your PC:<br /><a href="http://download.fonosfera.org/2.3.7.1_PacoJr/FON2303_2.3.7.1_DEV.tgz">http://download.fonosfera.org/2.3.7.1_P … .1_DEV.tgz</a><br />Open web interface go to Settings -&gt; System&nbsp; and update firmware.<br />Once this is done you need to change admin password using web interface of fonera and connect router to the internet then you can SSH to fonera and flash openwrt from there.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cd /tmp
wget -O fonera.img http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09/ramips/rt305x/openwrt-ramips-rt305x-fonera20n-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin
mtd -r write fonera.img image</code></pre></div><p>Once it&#039;s done fonera will reboot.<br />Be patient.. it can take up to 10 minutes to finish.<br />Then you can use web interface on 192.168.1.1 or ssh but you need to set password first.</p><p>Hope it is helpful (for someone).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>petum84</strong> on 16 Sep 2015, 13:03)</p>
