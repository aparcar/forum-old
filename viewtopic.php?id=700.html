					<p>Hi group,</p><p>I wonder if it is possible to use the encryption coprocessing capabilities of the wireless chipset in order to speed up AES/3DES encryption in user space (obviously for use in VPN applications).</p><p>Does anyone have a hint where to look at?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

I&#039;d expect this stuff to be with the wireless drivers, but apparently there hardly is something to find in this sector - the driver source is closed and there seems to be no active work on something that would be open source.</p>									</div>

					<p>in some VIA processors (via C3 nehemia) there is a hardware encryption engine to which linux drivers/patches exist. &quot;PadLock ACE&quot;. Maybe you could use <br /><a href="http://www.logix.cz/michal/devel/padlock/">http://www.logix.cz/michal/devel/padlock/</a><br />as starting point?</p>									</div>
