					<p>I admin 4 or 5 networks for various members of family and have then all on different subnets as sometimes they get vpned together, most of the networks have a couple of static assignments (ATAs, NAS boxes etc) and I wondered if dnsmasq could work with wildcards or wildchars in ethers, if so how?</p><p>The other config files for dnsmasq&nbsp; &nbsp; /etc/config/dhcp&nbsp; &nbsp; /etc/dnsmasq.conf&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and&nbsp; &nbsp; /etc/dnsmasq.options are all subnet agnostic so that, without any static DHCP assignments, if you wish to change the subnet of your network all you have to do is edit your&nbsp; &nbsp; /etc/config/network&nbsp; &nbsp; file, on my home network with 12 static assignments it&#039;s a rather laborious process with 13 edits.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried an entry like <br />00:0A:E6:00:00:01 *.*.*.15 <br />but it didn&#039;t work.</p><p>Thanks for any help.</p>									</div>
