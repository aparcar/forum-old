					<p>Forgive me if I&#039;ve made any noobie type errors, but all I want to do is turn on the wifi hotspot in my Android mobile, and get the router to link to it to extend the wireless, and to additionally give wired access to the phones network. It works sort of with the factory firmware, but it&#039;s flakey, perfect and fast for a day or two, and then it will drop the WDS link or go really slow or some other annoying problem.</p><p>I&#039;m hoping OpenWRT may solve the flakeyness, but whatever I try I cannot get the system to work as I want. I can get the router to connect through the mobile to the internet, as long as it&#039;s on a different IP range, or I can get the router to join the same network, but then it can&#039;t get to the internet itself, and in both situations no clients wired or wireless will receive DHCP addressing from the mobile hotspot.</p><p>I prefer using LUCI if I can - the whole SSH/Telnet thing for some reason scares the hell out of me!!</p><p>Can anyone give a brief rundown of how they would configure this setup?</p>									</div>
