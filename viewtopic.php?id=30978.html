					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a strange situation when sending firmware to DSL-G684T over ethernet. Basically, when I&#039;m sending the firmware from Linux using its &#039;ftp&#039; command, the firmware sometimes gets sent completely, but sometimes not at all and sometimes only in few percents (observed from adam2 output).</p><p>On the other hand, when I use &#039;<a href="ftp://ftp.exe">ftp.exe</a>&#039; from Windows XP, then there is no problem sending the firmware. What is more, I&#039;m using &#039;<a href="ftp://ftp.exe">ftp.exe</a>&#039; from Windows XP, which is installed on the VirtualBox on Linux machine! I&#039;ve also tried using &#039;wine&#039; with &#039;<a href="ftp://ftp.exe">ftp.exe</a>&#039; under Linux and it worked...</p><p>Both &#039;ftp&#039; and &#039;<a href="ftp://ftp.exe">ftp.exe</a>&#039; are always given the same transmission parameters (passive mode, media flsh, etc.).</p><p>My question is, what can be (or what can I do) wrong with Linux?</p><p>--<br />Best regards,<br />Andrzej Telszewski</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Small update. Actually there is no difference what OS (Linux/Windows) I use to upload the firmware. Sometimes I can upload the firmware few times one after another, sometimes only once, sometimes not at all, but all this are somehow random things. Generally, rebooting the PC and router helps. When uploading firmware, there is direct connection between the router and the PC, and this is the only network available at the moment on the PC (e.g. to exclude interfereces with other packets, if any...).</p><p>So the new question is: what can disturb the upload process?</p><p>--<br />Best regards,<br />AT</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>atelszewski</strong> on 22 Jul 2011, 19:59)</p>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Out of topic:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>this board has serch function implemented</p></blockquote></div><p>I know it, I used it, and didn&#039;t find it. I think this comment wasn&#039;t necessary: do you think I&#039;d ask here if I knew or found the answer? I&#039;m not going to argue here, but sometimes there are things you are fighting with for very long time I can&#039;t cope with. Haven&#039;t you ever asked the question that have been already answered? I take great care for what I&#039;m asking.<br />On topic:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Read this carefully</p></blockquote></div><p>That&#039;s perfectly what I was looking for and the reason I couldn&#039;t sleep for long hours! Thanks!</p><p>--<br />Best regards,<br />AT</p>									</div>
