Now, per default openwrt bridges wlan and lan, so there might be no relevant interfaces to instantiate sqm on. You should always be able to change the setup to routed instead of bridged though, so that the multiple sqm instances method has a chance of working again.<br />Please also note that current sqm-scripts work okay for wlan/wifi, but are not perfect (as the make-wifi-fast project has not yet started for real partly due to lack of funding).</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;M.</p>									</div>
