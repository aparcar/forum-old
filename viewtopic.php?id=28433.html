					<p>Hi,</p><p>I managed to brick my DG834G V3. I was doing a routine upgrade, and flashed an image through the web panel. Something went wrong but seemingly something like that can happen when the image is close to the 4 MB mark. Thought nothing of it as I entered recovery mode, and went on with:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># ./nftp -u eth0 ../Dropbox/DG834/DG834GV3_V4.01.40_DGTeam_1022_eng_adsldrv703.img
Sending frame on eth0 (a:b:c:d:e:f)
Found a router at x:y:z:t:u:w
Router is a DG834V3
Current version is 4128
If everything above looks good, press Enter now.

Erasing flash, this will take around ten seconds...
Upgrading:       1024/4063232 bytes</code></pre></div><p>However, erasing took a lot more than 10 seconds, and Upgrading never went further than 1024. After about half an hour of this I gave up and pulled the plug.</p><p>Now whenever power is applied, the Power light goes solid green, but Test keeps blinking. Then the LAN light comes up, but shortly after that the router resets itself: Power and Test turn off, Internet and 1-2-3-4 light up briefly and then it&#039;s back to square 1.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried the 30/30/30 reset thing but whenever the reset button is pressed, the router just keeps rebooting furiously. I&#039;ve also attempted setting up a static route but so far with no luck at all. Is there anything I can do to get it unstuck, or JTAG is my only option?</p><p>BTW the router was working well before the bad flash, still I wonder if it&#039;s possible that it failed twice because of some previously undetected hardware problem?</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the reply.</p><p>It&#039;s no longer possible to enter recovery mode as it can only be activated by holding the reset button pressed while plugging it in, and this just produce continuous rebooting.</p><p>I need to stop the rebooting but all my attempts failed: direct connection, using another DG834, ping, ftp, tftp, telnet... nothing seems to work. The activity LED shows it&#039;s receiving, but I get no reply.</p><p>Suppose JTAG is the only way out, unless someone has an ace up his sleeve and can save my sorry ass... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>PS: I&#039;ve been googling like a madman looking for solutions, after posting I dug out some info I&#039;m going to share in case someone with the same problem finds this thread. Apparently most people (and possibly everybody) who have tried that specific image (DGTeam&nbsp; 1122) have also bricked their routers.</p><p>So avoid it at all costs, and for those who have already flashed it, try recovery mode and load either an official or the last good DGTeam image (0849 for V1/V2 or 1018 for the others). The latter can be found on this site: <a href="http://jake-tm.co.uk/?page_id=259">http://jake-tm.co.uk/?page_id=259</a></p><p>Don&#039;t do the same mistake I did...</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey,</p><p>Yeh your going to need to JTAG in adam2 again, the images are prefixed with the adam2 bin when uploading in recovery mode. Not entirely sure but I think it overwrites it... however when I tested this with another bootloader inserted I still got some adam2 sign on so not too sure, but it is definitely hosed. The only way I upgrade my dg834gv3 is via the recovery mode using nftp like that, in the ar7 image makefile uncomment the sercomm stuff and point it at the adam2 bin for that router, and you have a working recovery mode image.<br />Hope this helps.</p><p>Also while we are on the topic of DG834G&#039;s for anyone which has/had this problem if your router enters &#039;ASMode&#039; in a normal boot.

I started comparing manually it to the firmware I was using before (849) and I couldn&#039;t spot any difference so I fired up KDiff3: they&#039;re byte for byte the same up to roughly the first 640 kiB or 15%. Then thrown the official 4.01.40 in the mix, and that&#039;s equal, too.</p><p>So there&#039;s no reason I can see why nftp would fail flashing 1122 and not 849 or the official image... Still, it stalled at 1024B. If my router&#039;s faulty it should have started acting up well before the flash, I guess. That leaves me looking at nftp in a different light...</p><p>@ <strong>fyi</strong>, any particular reason to prefer 4.01.30 over 4.01.40 ?</p>									</div>

Most 3310 circuit schematics out there call for a MAX232, elsewhere I&#039;m reading the F-Bus runs at 3.3V and this seems consistent with voltage I&#039;m measuring.
