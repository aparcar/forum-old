					<p>If the router is into failsafe mode, then it is configured to 192.168.1.1/24, and you should configure your computer to another IP in the same network, like 192.168.1.2/24.</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s very easy to get a serial port connection on that hardware. Open up the case and plug in.</p><p>That being said, you should just be able to recover with the reset button (wipe overlay).
