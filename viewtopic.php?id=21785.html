					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am trying to add an extra hard disk (to use as a NAS) to my x86-generic router, but I still have not luck. I use the latest SVN trunk.</p><p>It is an Samsung SATA HDD connected to a VIA VT8237 southbridge. It does not show up as /dev/hdb, /dev/sd* or whatever, even if I add extra packages defined under Kernel Modules -&gt; Block Devices.</p><p>Also, if I add kmod-ata-via-sata (as module or compiled), it still does not show up. Even compiled as a package, I canÂ´t find the opkg package kmod-ata-via-sata.</p><p>I tried kernel 2.6.30 and 2.6.28, but without luck. Is there something more I have to do? The BIOS does show the hard drive and Ubuntu 9.04 runs perfectly from a SATA disk.</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br />Basil</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>basilfx</strong> on 14 Sep 2009, 23:13)</p>

					<p>I finally fixed my problem.</p><p>This is how I did it:<br />* &#039;make menuconfig&#039; -&gt; disable all kernel block modules<br />* kernel boot parameters -&gt; root=/dev/sdb2 instead of root=/dev/hda2 (my CF module is /dev/sdb)<br />* &#039;make kernel_menuconfig&#039; -&gt; Device Drivers -&gt; Block Devices<br />* disable &#039;ATA/ATAPI/MFM/RLL support&#039;<br />* Enable &#039;Device / Serial ATA (prod) and Parallel ATA (experimental) drivers&quot; and &quot;Device Drivers / SCSI device support&#039;<br />* Under previous option, enable SATA drivers for VIA PATA and VIA SATA (can be configured when selecting latest option). Make sure you compile this as build-in!<br />* Under SCSI support, enable Generic Disk Support (to enable /dev/sd* numbering).</p><p>If you can boot your firmware, then everything succeeded. The standard kmod-* modules do not enable /dev/sd* and since it is compiled as a module, it does not load before mounting rootfs. By disabeling the old IDE driver (and thus disable /dev/hd*) and switch to the new one, I could acces my extra harddisk.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>basilfx</strong> on 16 Sep 2009, 12:48)</p>
