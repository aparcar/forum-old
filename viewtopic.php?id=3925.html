					<p>Thanks for all the help.&nbsp; I now have a laptop on the separate vlan for testing.&nbsp; I tried the robocfg setting, but that completely removes all tx to the router as well.&nbsp; I have the vlan2 as 192.168.2.1 and due to the different range, it seems to keep the traffic separate.&nbsp; Now my problem is trying to get dhcp to work on that interface.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to modify the /etc/init.d/S50dnsmasq script, but I&#039;m having a hard time figuring out how to add the new IP and still keep the old one.&nbsp; Is there an easy way to just add an interface to dnsmasq that I&#039;m missing?</p>									</div>
