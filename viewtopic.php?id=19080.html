					<p>Ok.&nbsp; Assuming you&#039;re using the OpenWRT dev kit (which is probably a safe assumption since you seem to have successfully made a kernel module for the mipsel architecture), I guess it&#039;s just a matter of getting your changes in the trunk.</p><p>Perhaps someone else here who has read this thread can help with that.&nbsp; On a side note, I think the goal is to eventually do away with the 2.4 target.</p>									</div>
