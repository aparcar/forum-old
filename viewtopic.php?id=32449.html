					<p>Hi,</p><p>I was struggling with the problem of &quot;Broken pipe&quot; when using ssh <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27484">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27484</a>. Connection es reseted. I&#039;ve found that the problem only happens when ssh connections are outbound. I mean *only* when packets traverse out Cisco PIX (OS Version 7.0(1)) . </p><p>It&#039;s strange because problem began when we started to use OpenWt with kernel 2.6.x kernel series. What could it be causing such a behavior?&nbsp; any ideas?</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>

					<p>More than likely the PIX is configured to drop &quot;idle&quot; TCP and/or SSH sessions.&nbsp; Idle as determined by the PIX; usually some time without activity.&nbsp; It probably sends a TCP RST to close the connection.&nbsp; This could be verified by looking at the configuration on the PIX and/or analyzing a TCP dump to look for the source of the RST packet.</p>									</div>

I don&#039;t think that this problem is due to some configuration of idle sessions, because it happens sometimes in less of one minute, and only happens when one connects through OpenWRT router and traverses CISCO PIX. </p><p>I mean:</p><p>station-&gt;whatever switch-&gt;PIX-&gt;remote SSH: no problem<br />station-&gt;OpenWRT router-&gt;PIX-&gt;&quot;inner&quot; SSH: no problem<br />station-&gt;OpenWRT router-&gt;PIX-&gt;remote SSH: PROBLEM: Broken PIPE</p><p>I&#039;ve found that problem disappears when using proxy arp and disable masquerading. But I wonder what happens between CISCO PIX and OpenWRT w/kernel 2.6...</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>
