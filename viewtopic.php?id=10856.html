					<p>Hi everyone!</p><p>I don&#039;t know if it helps, but the <em>Milkfish</em> project seems to have made a package for <a href="http://wiki.milkfish.org/index.php?n=TheMilkfish.JabberServer">jabberd</a>.<br />The package itself is located <a href="http://packages.milkfish.org/boozy/3.0.0_rc5/milkfish-jabberd_1.4.4-2_mipsel.ipk">here</a>, but unfortunately I haven&#039;t found the corresponding package files to build the iPKG (e.g. for a new version). But maybe the given package might also work directly with OpenWRT, because <em>Milkfish Boozy</em> is based on OpenWRT to begin with.</p><p>But of course I&#039;d like to see an official OpenWRT package for a jabber server. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Either way, thanks for you work so far, folks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi folks,</p><p>Yes, Budrus of the Milkfish Project ported jabberd from jabberd.org some time ago for Whiterussian RC4. <br />Here is the package source: <a href="http://packages.milkfish.org/sources/jabberd/">http://packages.milkfish.org/sources/jabberd/</a></p><p>There is one issue existing in the version we made in the dialback (or s2s) module which is:<br />Dynamically changing WAN IP addresses cause a DNS-cache error on the far end.<br />This is even valid for usual jabberd applications being statically IPed servers, of course.</p><p>I submitted a bug report, but it seems untouched ever since:<br /><a href="http://webview.jabberd.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54">http://webview.jabberd.org/cgi-bin/bugz â€¦ .cgi?id=54</a></p><p>Apart from that, basic functionality was given with our port.</p><p>Here&#039;s a more detailed description of the problem:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dialback host:ip-cache inconsitency with dynamic ip servers


If a jabber server is assigned a dynamic ip address a change in this address
(e.g. by a broadband reconnect) results in a invalidation of dialback cache
entries of all other jabber servers having had recent s2s contact with the one
whichs ip just changed.

Server1 Log:
20060530T21:18:44: [warn] (s2s): Denying peer to use the domain [Server1].
Dialback failed (timeout): &lt;db:result to=&#039;[Server1]&#039; from=&#039;[Server2]&#039; typ

Server2 Log:
20060530T21:18:45: [alert] (s2s): We were told by [Server1] that our sending
name [Server2] is invalid, either something went wrong on their end, we tried
using that name improperly, or dns does not resolve to us

Suggestion:
After such a cache inconsistency is noticed but before the actual rejection
is sent out, the dialback component could update the cache using dns resolution,
as done for new s2s contacts.
If the failure persists there is something wrong indeed.
If not, the cache is thereby updated and communication continues as usual.</code></pre></div>									</div>
