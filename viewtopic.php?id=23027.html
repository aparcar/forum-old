					<p>Good deal.&nbsp; Thanks for posting.&nbsp; This looks like an unrouted client bridge, since you&#039;re bridging the wifi to the lan side instead of to the WAN side.</p>									</div>

					<p>&gt;This looks like an unrouted client bridge</p><p>I think this means, effectively, that devices plugged into the client router do not have access to devices on the other side of the wireless link, even if they have static ips in the same network and &quot;dns&quot; and &quot;gateway&quot; set.&nbsp; That is the behaviour I have seen so far, which does not matter for my primary purpose, but internet access would be nice to have.</p><p>If anyone can suggest how to achieve this while maintaining the present functionality, that would be appreciated.&nbsp; Also, my setup omits port 0.&nbsp; What is that for and could I just add it to the &quot;option ports&quot; line?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lizby</strong> on 31 Dec 2009, 21:29)</p>

					<p>The problem of devices plugged into the router not having access to the internet is fixed by adding masquerading to the lan zone in /etc/config/firewall by adding the line &quot;option masq&nbsp; &nbsp; 1&quot;.</p><p>I have edited the original post to include this.</p><p>This has also enabled pinging and access between devices on either side of the wireless bridge.</p>									</div>
