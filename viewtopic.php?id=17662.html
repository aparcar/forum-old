					<p>Hi ninjasteve, at this time you can buy the new Fonera 2.0, with 1 USB 2.0 port, 32 MB of ram, 8 MB of flash, and an Atheros SoC running @ 180MHz for 40 â‚¬ + shipping fee. I&#039;m trying it with the new Openwrt 8.09 and it works, but I&#039;d&nbsp; like to compile from trunk to have a custom build with all the needed packages for USB. The problem I&#039;ve in this moment is that if I share (with samba) a USB disk (FAT32) I can transfer data at a maximum rate of about 1MB/s (via cable...). I see (with top) that the samba server process eats a lot of CPU time... maybe I can try to use NFS. I&#039;ll try in the furure, in this moment I haven&#039;t a lot of free time.. I&#039;ll try CUPS to share my printer, and in the future sane, also, for the scanner.<br />Best regards<br />Francesco</p>									</div>

FON WiFi routers are underpowered even overclocked! I have my FON2100 running on OpenWRT SVN with only asterisk-1.6.0.1 (no WiFi or other packages). The asterisk works just fine, except if I do something, i.e. ssh into my FON, the audio quality on an on-going call drops dramatically that the audio voice sounded like, not only choppy, but robotic. Overclocking my FON2100 to 200MHz doesn&#039;t help at all.</p><p>If you want to invest on a WiFi router that is supported by any open-source community firmware, at least go with the recommendation by MMCM above.</p>									</div>

					<p>I know.. everything depends on what you want from that hardware, I&#039;ve explained my problems using the samba sharing (CPU lack), but, you know, there are some differences in the design of the 2100 and all other FON routers. 2100 uses a Linear Voltage Regulator, that causes overheat of the board. I don&#039;t know if the SoC switches its frequency to prevent overheating. 2200, and newer router, use a switching regulator drop-down module that keeps board temperature around 30-40Â°C. <br />I haven&#039;t tried to use Asterisk as a call PBX (here in Italy there is a free online pbx that is very very good for home use; I don&#039;t know if I can make ads here, if you want to know maybe you can PM me...), I use it only to remote manage things at home, so I can&#039;t tell you if on my board there is the same problem you have, mazilo.<br />So, I repeat, this is a low cost router, so you can&#039;t expect high performances.<br />Bye<br />Francesco</p>									</div>
