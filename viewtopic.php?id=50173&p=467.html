					<p>Yes, but this requires a serial connection, which when using tftp seems counter intuitive. I just expect some reasonable known default, and to just set the required IP on my tftp server.

					<p>Not that it really matters, but 2 times I attempted to upgrade using the sysupgrade command, needed to be recovered by secondary flash. So, since that time, I&#039;ve always just used luci and flashed the .img, and haven&#039;t had any problems with that method.</p><p>Would anyone be surprised if someone had the opposite experience? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Heck, we probably have some who brick just so they can have fun trying to recover.
