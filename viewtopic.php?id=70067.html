					<p>Hello,<br />I have a BananaPi and an e3372 USB-LTE Modem. Behind the BananaPi I have my primary ASUS Router. This Asus Router shall handle alle my network traffic.<br />The BananaPi has one Gbit LAN and gets power over PoE. There is no WLAN and no special need for a firewall. </p><p>I want to bridge USB-Wan to LAN, so that my Asus Router gets the external IP. But I also want to have access to the BananaPi over the same LAN cable.</p><p>Right now, I have only one LAN interface. This LAN is bridging etho and eth1. LAN: IP:192.168.1.3/24//no gateway/DNS:8.8.8.8<br /> WAN Ip is bridged correct but the BananaPi Openwrt is OFFLINE!<br />Also I dont have access to the OpenWRT WebUI threw the Asus Router. To get access to BananaPi Openwrt WebUI, I need to use a switch <strong>in front of</strong> the Asus Router. Then I can plug a Laptop to this swith with any static Ip within the banana Ip range. then I have access to the BananaPi.</p><p>The big problem is, that I want to use some ping test scripts to check weather my USB Modem is online or not. As long as my BananPi bridges all the Internet threw and isnt online by itself, I cannot use any of my scritps. </p><p>I need a configuration, so that my Openwrt is online and bridges the WAN IP forward to my Asus Router and I need access to the BananaPi WebUi for maintaining.</p><p>my configuration right now:<br />USB LTE Modem -external WAN-IP<br />BananaPi&nbsp; IP:192.168.1.3/24 static<br />Asus DHCP router: IP:192.168.1.1/24 (DHCP from 100 to 150, Firewall, manages two VPN connections)<br />VPN1: 192.68.4.0<br />VPN2: 192.168.3.0<br />Ip range from 192.168.1.4 to 192.168.1.9 is free. higher IPs are assigned to clients</p><br /><p>I dont know how to manage the Opwnwrt settings for my problem. While I setup OpenWrt, it is online until i bridge etho and eth1. At that moment, Internet is bridged correct and Openwrt went offline.</p><p>Can anyone help?</p><p>PS:. The BananaPi is located at the roof of a house. Everyone could get access to the BananaPi. Therefore I dont want to use the BananaPi as primary Router and I dont want to have Passwords or any other sensitive files on it!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>donaufisch66</strong> on 1 Mar 2017, 11:14)</p>

					<p>LTE modem usually acts like a simple router.&nbsp; It hands out DHCP addresses.&nbsp; It can NAT multiple devices to the one public IP it has on LTE.</p><p>If that&#039;s the case you want the Banana Pi to be purely a bridge.&nbsp; Your main router will send out a DHCP request and end up getting its WAN address from the modem.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t even know there is another device in between.</p><p>This does mean you will need to re-plug a cable and use a static address on your PC to log into the Banana Pi.&nbsp; During normal operation, you can test connectivity by pinging the modem.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,<br />my modem is Not-Hilink. It is just a modem, no Router, no NAT or anything else. I use a spezial firmware. So, all I get is the external IP from the LTE modem. This external IP is forwarded to my Asus Router.</p><p>The Problem is, that the Pi himself is offline! He bridges the Internet to my Asus Router but cannot connect to the internet himself<br />If I try to ping any address at &quot;Network/diagnostic&quot; from the Openwrt Pi, (not from a client), I get an &quot;bad address&quot; error.<br />If I turn of bridging, the Pi goes immediately online, because he himself&nbsp; gets the external IP from the modem. At the moment I add eth1 to eth0 at the LAN interface, the Pi himself is offline again.</p><p>I want my Pi to do two things at the same time (parallel). He shall forward the external IP (bridging) AND use the external IP for himself to be online himself. <br />How can I do this????<br />If a client needs to connect to the Pi for maintenance, he will need internet for installing software packages to the Pi, testing onlinestate of modem etc...</p><p>I also want to run a &quot;ping check&quot; Skript, to check weather the modem is online or not. If not, the modem reconnects or the Pi reboots. I have to run these Skripts on the Pi, therefore he has to be online!</p><p>please help with the network configuration.! <br />greetings Bob</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><p>I want my Pi to be online and parallel he should forward the external IP to the Asus router.</p>									</div>

					<p>You only have one public IP and want to connect two devices to the internet through it.&nbsp; </p><p>To actually do that you would need to NAT-- on the Pi.&nbsp; This has the downside that all your regular internet use will be double-NATed.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, thank you. <br />I will change my Pi from Bridge to Router and forward the VPN ports to my asus router. This may be the easierst way to solve my issues.<br />greetings</p>									</div>
