					<p>I&#039;ve got a Corega CG-WLR300GNH (a Japanese 4 port gigabit + n/g/b router) with an RT3052 board.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got serial console access and it looks like the manufacturer&#039;s firmware is based on an old version of open-wrt (the /etc/banner file seems to indicate Kamikaze 7.09), and the kernel is 2.6.21.<br />I&#039;m currently in the process of requesting a copy of any GPL source, though based on the info on their home page for their other products it looks like they may only offer to provide it on CD with a rather high &quot;shipping and handling&quot; fee... we&#039;ll see.<br />In the meantime, any pointers on setting up a new ramips device would be much appreciated.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;ve tried going through the first steps and setting up a new device wiki pages, but am having some trouble figuring out what actually needs to be done.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got a fair amount of experience building kernels and custom linux installations on the desktop, and some high level experience with open-wrt and dd-wrt from a buffalo router I had (its death is what prompted this new device), but this is my first in-depth work on router firmware.&nbsp; Here&#039;s the info I&#039;ve got so far:</p><p><a href="http://corega.jp/support/download/driver/wlr300gnh_150.exe">Most recent official firmware</a> (self extracting zip file)<br /><a href="http://pastebin.com/BRXCLdx1">Binwalk of the firmware</a><br /><a href="http://pastebin.com/HemcFaGp">Serial console output for a full boot*</a><br /><a href="http://pastebin.com/auNdf3L3">cat /proc/mtd</a><br /><a href="http://pastebin.com/NN17S1PJ">lsmod</a><br /><a href="http://pastebin.com/PFqCd8jY">ifconfig</a><br /><a href="http://pastebin.com/SJPt3SEY">ps</a></p><p>*I tried flashing once before I really knew what I was doing.&nbsp; This caused the device to stop booting and I may have erased arbitrary chunks of flash.&nbsp; After figuring out what I was doing and manually flashing the original kernel/rootfs via bootloader things are running as normal though, so it doesn&#039;t look like I caused too much damage.&nbsp; The boot log is from after this incident, so its possible its not completely stock.</p><p>The page on setting up a new device indicates that I need info on the gpio pins and watchdog timer, which I don&#039;t know how to get.&nbsp; There&#039;s gpioled and gpiomonitor commands in /usr/sbin, and I can use gpioled to turn the various leds on and off by name.&nbsp; There&#039;s no /sys/class/gpio node that I&#039;ve seen refrences to elsewhere.</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jenden</strong> on 15 Jan 2013, 13:04)</p>

					<p>/sys/class/gpio is for user space access to unassigned gpios. Not what you need.<br />You need to know what the assigned ones point to.<br />In terms of what you need from the manufacturer, all you need is the machine file (which contains all the board specific settings you need). Without this or a data sheet for the board, it becomes pretty difficult!</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the quick replies.<br />I&#039;ll give the vendor a few more days to come back with a response on the source code.&nbsp; If I don&#039;t make progress by the weekend I&#039;ll try flashing the firmware for a similar device.&nbsp; Based on the table of hardware it looks like the hw550-3g is probably the closest match (though I&#039;m guessing based on the name that it has a 3g modem, which mine doesn&#039;t).&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ll probably search around a bit more and see if I can find anything a bit closer.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yep.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been looking through the dmesg results (they&#039;re mostly the same as the boot log) but haven&#039;t found much more useful info<br /><a href="http://pastebin.com/K3ZtdwUs">dmesg log</a><br />Can run any other commands or pull any other files that might be useful.</p><p>I was trying to boot a ramdisk last night to see if I could try some more tests without going through the headache of flashing back and forth between versions.&nbsp; First discovery was that the lzma header expected seems to be different than that used by the current openwrt images generated by the openwrt image builder.&nbsp; Binwalk identifies the differences as lzma (sig 2) and lzma (sig 3) for the stock and openwrt firmware respectively.&nbsp; Decompressing the uImage file and compressing it with the lzma binary from <a href="http://tukaani.org/lzma/">lzma utils</a> caused binwalk to identify it as lzma (sig 1), but this got through decompression successfully.&nbsp; Then I got data crc errors, which I&#039;m guessing have to do with me not setting up the ramdisk correctly.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t have time to get any further than that yet.</p>									</div>

					<p>You have defined new board ID but this ID is unknown for kernel. Generic ramips setup does not init any flash (serial or physically mapped) so kernel can&#039;t find rootfs.

					<p>So before I had a chance to do much more I think I managed to break things beyond repair.&nbsp; I went to go hook up the serial cable and got nothing (or rather, got random binary stream).&nbsp; This is a rather crude makeshift cable, and my best guess is that the vcc on the cable accidentally got attached to one of the pins on the serial port and something shorted.<br />As things stand the router seems to boot and load up some services correctly (it responds to ping, ports that I had opened are still open, the http port comes up as open) but doesn&#039;t seem to respond to anything more complicated than a ping.&nbsp; Attempts to access the web interface lead to timeouts, and there is no WAN connection.&nbsp; Unfortunately it has the stock firmware right now, so there&#039;s no ssh/telnet to try.&nbsp; The wifi is up (the AP is visible and clients can connect) but is extremely weak and flaky.</p><p>Probably going to go get a new router today as I don&#039;t have much hope for this one and I managed to find a pretty good buffalo with better openwrt support.&nbsp; Its only 10/100 instead of gigabit, so I may see if I can use this one as a switch.</p><p>Thanks for all the help everyone.</p>									</div>
