					<p>Sorry this isn&#039;t really on topic but someone here might be able to help. </p><p>I have a zhone 6228 (bonded ADSL router with two BCM96358s) which bricked itself during an official firmware update from the GUI. </p><p>I managed to open it up and identify serial monitor connections and watch the CFE boot which announced </p><p>&quot;*** Board is not initialized properly ***&quot;</p><p>After guessing at the board parameters it asked for it carried on booting and appeared to be functional with the old firmware (the CFE might have been updated). I attempted the firmware update again from the GUI and watched it happen without problem on the monitor. I have been trying to get the required board configuration information out of zhone for 4 days now, I can&#039;t believe they seem to be having difficulty providing such simple and essential information. </p><p>Can someone offer guidance on these configuration guesses? </p><p>Number of MAC addresses - the router has wireless and two consecutive MAC addresses on the label, I entered 2 with the first address on the label as the base address - does that sound right? </p><p>PSI Size - the range is 1-128k with 128k default which I used. From searching the web it seems most boards use a lower value. I have no idea what this does is the size critical? is the default likely to be what is required?</p><p>Main thread number [0|1] - used default 0 - right? </p><p>Hardware version (maximum 16 words) - No default and no idea. I suppose completely device specific if it needs something. After leaving it blank and it being the last item it asked for it said &quot;unknown PHY type&quot; then reported the CPU speed etc. The Ethernet is working and I don&#039;t see an &quot;unknown PHY type&quot; on subsequent boots - should I worry?</p><p>TIA</p>									</div>
