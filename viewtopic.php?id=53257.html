					<p>Hi guys, I&#039;m trying to get OpenWRT onto a DGND3300 that was gifted to me (stolen from work) so that I can set set up a wireless connection to some lab equipment I&#039;m keeping under the stairs. It&#039;s running on the BCM6358U chipset but this is the best details I can find. Apparently this is a family of chipsets so I&#039;m trying to find more detail about it but this hasn&#039;t proven fruitful so far.</p><p>This has so far gotten me up to here: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/brcm63xx/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_br â€¦ /brcm63xx/</a></p><p>Now I&#039;m not sure what to do because I&#039;m worried about bricking it and not being able to go any further. Is see there&#039;s a generic build but this looks like it&#039;s significantly smaller than the other images so I assume that is some kind of blank slate without any drivers in it and wouldn&#039;t help me with mine. I know that this router isn&#039;t officially supported because of the modem but I don&#039;t care about that and I only need the routing, switching and AP features.</p><p>Can anyone provide me with a few more clues? Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>
