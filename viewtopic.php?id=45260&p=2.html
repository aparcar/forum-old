					<p>And if the FCC report of 29.7 dBm max Tx power for this router wasn&#039;t enough, I just did a quick test and flashed the original Bufallo firmware v1.77 (*), the one which is NOT based on DD-WRT. I can confirm I&#039;m getting about <strong>12 dB</strong> more received power compared to OpenWRT. That&#039;s on default settings, I didn&#039;t change anything in the Buffalo fw settings (I actually didn&#039;t find an option to change the Tx power in the Buffalo fw). You can do this test too, e.g. use an Android phone with Wifi analyzer.</p><p>So it is indeed capable of a lot more than 15 dBm. jow&#039;s latest reply above made me a bit sad <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> but now that there is proof, can the devs please look into this?</p><p>I can&#039;t use the Bufallo/DD-WRT fw as I need Radius support for wired which only OpenWRT can provide cleanly via wpa-supplicant, otherwise I&#039;d ditch OpenWRT. My next router will probably not have an Atheros 9k wifi chip. Can anyone confirm which routers can reach <em>real</em> 20 dBm or beyond via OpenWRT?</p><p><em>(*) if you wish to do the same test, make sure you download the Buffalo fw from your region. I was not able to flash the v1.78 fw from the USA downloads website; the router rejects it with an &quot;invalid region&quot; error. I had to flash the v1.77 from the Europe region downloads as my router was purchased from UK. You need to flash it via the tftp method -- I flashed the dd-wrt pro version first via tftp and then the buffalo v1.77 from the dd-wrt web gui.</em></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mastabog</strong> on 11 Aug 2013, 21:02)</p>

					<p>100% ACK. I would wish that the developers solve this problem, too. In all other things the WZR-HP-AG300H is a powerful and stable unit, but a loss of power only for fw-error isn&#039;t good. I need openWRT, too, as it works flawless and with option I can&#039;t get on original-fw or on ddwrt.</p>									</div>
