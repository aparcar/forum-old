					<p>Hello,<br />I&#039;ve been considering this router. I really like the idea of it. However, what concerns me, is that:<br />1 - There don&#039;t seem to be very many posts or reviews online from people who&#039;ve actually tried this device and come away with a positive impression.<br />2 - I&#039;ve been reading the forums and while many of the posts are a month old, it does concern me whether or not I&#039;d have great difficulty in getting this working. I&#039;m not into using the NAS and server functionality much, nor changing any of the internal components. At most, I&#039;d run OpenVPN on it. But given that other people rely on me, I&#039;d be under pressure, if it doesn&#039;t work more or less out of the box. Which isn&#039;t too nice. I&#039;m not extremely tech-savvy, but I&#039;m somewhere in the middle; Fairly newish Linux &amp; VPN user, currently run DD-WRT on my router, dabbled a bit in a couple of programming languages, but never enough to become serious, know how to assemble a PC, etc. So, at this stage of development, what SHOULD I expect, upon opening the box?<br />3 - It&#039;s not clear if it ships with all the required power cables and such.<br />Thank you.</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><p>I didn&#039;t get the right answer from the internet</p>									</div>
