					<p>I&#039;ve to build my software with OpenWrt to be deployed on a customer&#039;s target device. For this to succeed, I need a special tool on the host system. Can anyone give me a few tips and hints on how to write a package which builds a tool for the host rather than for the target?</p><p>After searching the Internet for OpenWrt host tools and host packages for the past few hours, the best I&#039;ve come up with is the following package Makefile for my tool. But these commands do not get invoked by OpenWrt.</p><p>What am I missing? Or am I on the wrong track overall?</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>include $(TOPDIR)/rules.mk

PKG_NAME := project-traits
PKG_VERSION := 6.0.0

PKG_SOURCE_URL := &lt;internal git repository&gt;

HOST_BUILD_PARALLEL := 1
HOST_CONFIGURE_PARALLEL := 1
HOST_BUILD_DIR := $(BUILD_DIR_HOST)/$(PKG_NAME)-$(PKG_VERSION)

include $(INCLUDE_DIR)/host-build.mk
include $(INCLUDE_DIR)/cmake.mk

MAKE_PATH := llvm-build

CMAKE_OPTIONS += -B$(HOST_BUILD_DIR)/$(MAKE_PATH) -H$(HOST_BUILD_DIR)/llvm &amp;&amp; echo

define Host/Prepare
    echo &#039;This is the generator build!&#039;

    # stripped: fetch the traits generator source code

# Use Host/Compile from cmake.mk

define Host/Install
    # stripped: install the build generator into the staging dir

$(eval $(call HostBuild))</code></pre></div><p>And in the requiring target package, I&#039;ve included</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>PKG_BUILD_DEPENDS += project-traits/host</code></pre></div><p>For confidentiality and for the sake of keeping the pasted code reduced to the essentials, I blanked out a few things or left them out. But you should get the intention. I don&#039;t see any of the build&#039;s output on the command line or in the build log. OpenWrt seems to just ignore my generator tool and hence fails to build the target package.</p><p>In case it makes any differences: I&#039;m not building on direct OpenWrt source files. Instead I get a pre-built OpenWrt SDK from the customer. But I haven&#039;t been able to figure out what the difference is, besides a pre-populated device configuration file.</p><p>Any help on this &quot;lightly&quot; documented topic is appreciated.</p><p>This is a cross-post with Stack Overflow. (I&#039;m not allowed to post the link to the SO thread)</p>									</div>
