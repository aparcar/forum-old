					<p>Solved!</p><p>1) with JTAG, I flashed CFE, using a copy of an WRT54G ver 3.1 and - but not strictly necessary - I flashed NVRAM obtained from original backup<br />2) with tftp method, uploaded a VINT version of ddwrt (note that VINT version is necessary because the presence of module wifi BMC94306 *rev4*); is also possible to use a openwrt WR release, but is necessary add a 32 byte header to this fw (i guess because CFE refuse fw whitout this header, obtained from Linksys fw... remember? also CFE come from a Linksys router).<br />3) as described in <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/openwrtdocs/hardware/dell/truemobile2300">http://wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/openwrt … mobile2300</a>, the only way to communicate with Sparklan after the uploading of ddwrt fw is through WLAN i/f (you see a new ddwrt network in your wireless list); connection is simple: no security and dhcp server on.<br />4) the reason why LAN (and WAN) i/f don&#039;t work are - i guess - two:<br />a) ddwrt fw use VLAN method to obtain a separated WAN i/f from a unique hardware switch (typical for the WRT54 routers), but Sparklan hw use 2 separated chips for LAN and WAN i/f; therefore, in a telnet/ssh session, use &quot;vconfig rem vlanX&quot; where vlanX is obtained from ifconfig command<br />b) during boot, the CPU of this board use some i/o to initialize other chip, such LAN chip; also if tftp method work over LAN i/f, after boot, this i/f went not working (all LED permantely on); probably CFE or ddwrt set this chip in an inappropriate way; I solved whit &quot;gpio enable 2&quot; command.</p><p>Indeed, LED are not perfectly workings.<br />The i/o map (referred to the gpio command):<br />0 reset button<br />1 ???<br />2 enable/disable LAN<br />3 power LED (enable=blink, disable=on)<br />4 G LED (enable=off, disable=blink)<br />5 other not labeled LED (enable=off, disable=blink)<br />6 ??? (with &quot;gpio disable 6&quot;, hard reset because handled from ddwrt fw)<br />7 ???</p><p>Can anyone help me to remap the i/o (LED function is not important, but reset button yes). Exist a file with this map, or the map is only included in fw source?<br />In other words: how firmware hadles i/o?<br />Thanks!</p>									</div>
