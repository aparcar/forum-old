					<p>Maybe someone can give me a hint:</p><p>I have one TP-Link wr703n set up as a repeater for my LAN. <br />No NAT, no firewall, just plain IP routing from one /24 net to another. <br />The internal Wifi-module is configured as a client as well as an AP, where the client (STA) Interface acts as the uplink. </p><p>Now, in order to improve performance, I added an USB Wifi-Adapter and configured this one to be the client Interace. Surprisingly, the performance is really very bad with this setup - a lot slower than with just one Interface acting as both - client and ap. Even though signal levels are just fine (actually better since there is an external antenna) and the AP Channel is more than 5 channels apart from the uplink. I already tried a number of different USB-Wifi-devices with different chipsets (ath9_htc and rtl81xx) but they all give poor results. Watching CPU load during transfers does not show any significant values, system is over 90% idle most of the time.</p><p>Any ideas how to troubleshoot this?</p>									</div>

					<p>Try to get the antennas as far apart as possible, like using an usb cable. Also, try to use channel 1 on one device and the highest possible channel on the other one.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you very much. <br />Separating the antennas is the only thing I haven&#039;t tried yet. <br />And it seems to do the trick. <br />So, after placing the antennas approx 1.5m apart, I get an improvement of approx. 25% (approx. 6 minutes for 70MB compared to 8 minutes without the additional usb device).</p>									</div>

					<p>Today, the ordered 802.11abgn USB Adapter arrived. Setup was easy and the performance improvement was well worth it. Preliminary tests show, that the performance is drastically improved! No more interference with the 2.4GHz Uplink.</p><p>So if anyone wants to upgrade his wr703n (or whatever running openwrt) to a dual-band device, this seems to be a good<br />choice. Here are some more details: </p><br /><p>Advertised as RT5572N Chipset, it actually anounces itself as follow:</p><p>[&nbsp; &nbsp; 9.500000] usb 1-1: reset high-speed USB device number 2 using ehci-platform<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 9.650000] ieee80211 phy0: rt2x00_set_rt: Info - RT chipset 5592, rev 0222 detected<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 9.690000] ieee80211 phy0: rt2x00_set_rf: Info - RF chipset 000f detected<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 9.700000] ieee80211 phy0: Selected rate control algorithm &#039;minstrel_ht&#039;<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 9.710000] usbcore: registered new interface driver rt2800usb</p><p>Note, that it says 5592 instead of 5572. Not sure if this is an error, since the 5592 is supposed to be a PCIe Chipset<br />whereas the 5572 is the USB variant. As you can see, it is supported by the RT28xx driver. <br />Easy installation:<br />$ opkg install kmod-rt2800-usb </p><br /><p>available 5GHz Channels - regulatory domain germany:<br />root@OpenWrt:~# iw reg get<br />country DE: DFS-ETSI<br />&nbsp;
