					<p>Sounds like my problem, but with FW: <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=9051">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=9051</a></p><p>Well, i think you can answer question 1 by your self: If you get a lan-&gt;wan connect without the Firewall, your settings are not correct.<br />The FW can only do its job, if there is a working connection, that is interrupted and managed by the FW.</p><p>Question2: sorry, no clue...would guess not.</p><p>Sorry, don&#039;t have the backround to give you an good hint with that.</p><p>cheers</p>									</div>
