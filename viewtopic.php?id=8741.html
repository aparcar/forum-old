					<p>Hi,<br />I had a Linksys WRT54G (ver 1.0) bought a while ago.&nbsp; Had assigned it a local address 172.16.0.68.&nbsp; Had set up admin password, encripted wireless trasmission etc., until a week ago I decided to go for openwrt, because I was excited about it that it will give me the flexibility of a linux system.</p><p>I followed the documentation, downloaded the white russian openwrt for pppoe, sqash FS and followed the recommended way to flash using the Linksys web-interface and flashed the router.&nbsp; The flashing was successful.&nbsp; One thing I didn&#039;t (and couldn&#039;t do) was to set the boot_wait.&nbsp; &nbsp;Searched the router documentation, but couldn&#039;t find a way to do it.</p><p>Now, I cannot login.&nbsp; I can ping well.&nbsp; However, neither telnet nor ssh work.&nbsp; I am immediately kicked out with a message:</p><p>telnet: connect to address 172.16.0.68: Connection refused.</p><p>I try ssh and the same again:</p><p>ssh: connect to address 172.16.0.68: port 22: Connection refused.</p><p>I think that reflashing wouldn&#039;t help.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t remember closing any ports on the router previously with the default linksys firmware.&nbsp; However, I did have encription enabled on the wireless interface with strict mac address checks.</p><p>The router seems to boot well, with Power (green) and Diag (red) light coming ON and then after about 10 secs the DMZ (green) light switch comes on, followed by Link (green) and a couple of blinks on Act.&nbsp; Finally, the power, link and top light in the internet box stay on.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have connected it to the up-link ethernet interface and I can ping it well without any loss of packets.</p><p>I searched the forum posts for similar problems.&nbsp; Couldn&#039;t find any so far.</p><p>Can somebody out there help me?<br />Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

Every ssh server has its host-keys, these are used to identify the server, to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks. If this changes, most ssh clients refuse to connect, until you manually acknowledge that the key has changed, or you remove the key from the clients known_hosts, depending on the client. You probably had another ssh server running on that 192.168.1.1 address, that&#039;s why you have the other key. In case of openssh, the known_hosts file is in ~/.ssh, this is where you need to delete that line containing 192.168.1.1, again not on the router, on your pc.</p>									</div>
