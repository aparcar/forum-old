I also compiled in a lot of packages I use (or plan on using), so the firmware image packs almost everything I need (I couldn&#039;t find htop <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue"/>).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Borromini</strong> on 21 Jun 2010, 14:01)</p>

					<p>For anybody who is interested I have uploaded <a href="http://rapidshare.com/files/401464600/build21843.zip">my build of openwrt.</a><br/>It is based on one of the latest branche&#039;s of backfire (build 21843) and contains all firmware versions (jffs and squashfs) including the &quot;.config&quot; file so you can make your own version.</p><p>The firmware contains:<br/>- OpenWRT base build 21843<br/>- Luci<br/>- Samba (editing of /etc/samba/smb.conf and smb.conf.template is highly recommended)<br/>- USB drivers (only storage for USB2)+automount<br/>- USB supports the filesystems: ext2, ext3, fat and ntfs<br/>- DDNS<br/>- NTP<br/>- UPNP<br/>- Wifi working (both 2,4GHz and 5GHz)<br/>- Realtime statistics<br/>- DHCP<br/>- PortForwarding<br/>- Router IP=192.168.1.1</p><p>It is fully functional. I&#039;ve tested it for the past 30 hours with only one issue... the internet connection is lost after configuring the wifi interfaces.. configuring/renewing the WAN interface fixes this, after that the WAN interface is stable.</p><p>An untested version based on the same .config file but with added ftp support and based on branch 21858 can be downloaded <a href="http://rapidshare.com/files/401472863/build21858.zip">here</a>.</p><p>[edit] Sry.. deleted the build21858.zip by accident.. will build a new(er) one soon..
