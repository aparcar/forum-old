No implies more stabilization. Now, Telefónica was improved speed but I&#039;m not nearest of central ISP. I&#039;ve disconnections over 3 to 30 minutes.

					<p>Things are getting pretty frustrating here.<br />It wasn&#039;t my intention to become a networking engineer and spend the next 5 months studying wikipedia and openwrt website.<br />I finally managed to access the router(now AP) setting my pc IP as for entering failsafe mode.<br />By the way, forget about failsafe mode, it won&#039;t connect, &quot;no route to host&quot;.<br />Also if you are locked out you don&#039;t even need failsafe mode! Just press with a paper clip the usual button for reset. Who knew that !? Wasn&#039;t failsafe mode the only way to go?<br />They released this new version of openwrt, which may be fantastic, but they forgot to release the instructions!<br />Example: I need to connect to internet through an external modem, and I found this tutorial:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/access.modem.through.nat">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/acces … hrough.nat</a><br />&quot;GUI version<br />Navigate to Admin → Network → Interfaces → WAN, fill in a name in the &quot;IP-Aliases&quot; add field and click &quot;Add&quot; &quot;<br />NO SUCH THING !!<br />All the support out there is about older versions, probably BB.<br />Downgrading could be a good thing to do.</p>									</div>
