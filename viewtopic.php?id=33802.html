					<p>Hi,</p><p>I just successfully installed cups on my OpenWRT 10.03.1 (on the router ASUS WL-500g Premium V1).<br />I enabled and start it without errors.<br />I can access the web CUPS admin page (<a href="http://192.168.2.1:631/admin">http://192.168.2.1:631/admin</a>).<br />Here is my cupsd.conf file content (/etc/cups/cupsd.conf) where you can see it could allow printing in my concerned LAN (Allow from 192.168.2.0/24):<br />AccessLog syslog<br />ErrorLog syslog<br />LogLevel info<br />PageLog syslog<br />PreserveJobHistory No<br />PreserveJobFiles No<br />AutoPurgeJobs Yes<br />MaxJobs 25<br />MaxPrinterHistory 10<br />RequestRoot /var/cups<br />User nobody<br />Group nogroup<br />RIPCache 512k<br />TempDir /var/cups<br /># Allow remote access<br />Port 631<br />HostNameLookups Off<br />KeepAlive On<br /># Enable printer sharing and shared printers.<br />Browsing On<br />BrowseOrder allow,deny<br />BrowseAllow all<br />BrowseRemoteProtocols CUPS<br />BrowseAddress @LOCAL<br />BrowseLocalProtocols CUPS<br />BrowseProtocols cups<br />&lt;Location /&gt;<br />&nbsp; # Allow shared printing and remote administration...<br />&nbsp; Order allow,deny<br />&nbsp; Allow @LOCAL<br />&nbsp; Allow from 192.168.2.0/24<br />&lt;/Location&gt;<br />&lt;Location /admin&gt;<br />&nbsp; AuthType Basic<br />&nbsp; AuthClass System<br />&nbsp; # Allow remote administration...<br />&nbsp; Order allow,deny<br />&nbsp; Allow @LOCAL<br />&lt;/Location&gt;<br />&lt;Location /admin/conf&gt;<br />&nbsp; AuthType Default<br />&nbsp; Require user @SYSTEM<br />&nbsp; # Allow remote access to the configuration files...<br />&nbsp; Order allow,deny<br />&nbsp; Allow @LOCAL<br />&lt;/Location&gt;</p><br /><p>I connected my network HP 3210 All In (photosmart) printer.<br />I can ping to thins network printer through the router.<br />If I try to access the common web HP printer page (<a href="http://192.168.2.104:9100">http://192.168.2.104:9100</a>) it just print something concerning the connected Linux computer but never display any HP Printer web page.

					<p>You should probably choose &quot;AppSocket/HP JetDirect&quot;, put in <a href="http://192.168.2.104:9100">http://192.168.2.104:9100</a>.&nbsp; After CUPS trundles, if the printer is found, then you will go to the drivers page, after this configuration step, then &quot;Print test page&quot; and you are done.</p>									</div>

					<p>Dear Yawlhoo and others,</p><p>sincerely thanks for your help but it does not change anything.</p><p>As proposed I used the proposed AppSocket/HP JetDirect.<br />After that I seriously I tried all the possibilities on the CUPS next web page :<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; http://hostname:631/ipp/<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; http://hostname:631/ipp/port1</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ipp://hostname/ipp/<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ipp://hostname/ipp/port1</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; lpd://hostname/queue</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; socket://hostname<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; socket://hostname:9100</p><p>With the socket://192.168.2.104:9100 it was available to the local computer but no correct test print page.</p><p>And for each case I tried as hostname the Printer IP (pingable to 192.168.2.104) or the router IP (192.168.2.1). <br />I tried to print a test page from the CUPS configuration web page and from the local computer. No one was able to print a test page.</p><p>I saw during the configuration that CUPS ask to select a &quot;Make&quot; : Raw queue (en). And there are no other possibilities than the Raw one.</p><p>Then I still does not have a workable network printer.</p><p>Thanks if you are able to help me.</p><p>Have a nice day.</p><p>Miguipda ;-)</p>									</div>

					<p>I will take another stab at this, based on my fumbling attempts in the past to get printers working with OpenWRT*.&nbsp; I believe it is true, others please correct me if I am wrong, that when the printer is connected via port 9100, all that happens is that the print stream from the remote client is sent directly to the printer.</p><p>Hence choosing the correct driver, etc, for the printer happens on the CLIENT.&nbsp; The client driver is configured for the particular model printer and therefore the stream headed to the printer contains (say, for HP PCL printers) the right set of ESC sequences, etc. to produce the correct printed page.</p><p>Hence, if you&#039;re at the point where you can telnet to the printer port 9100, type &quot;xyz&lt;RETURN&gt;&quot; and see something printed by the printer, that&#039;s all you can do on the OpenWRT box:<br />---<br />telnet 192.168.2.104 9100</p><p>you get a prompt</p><p>you type &quot;xyz&quot;, hit &lt;Return&gt;</p><p>see something print...</p><p>quit by hitting CNTRL-q (or is it CNTRL-c?)<br />---<br />To get nice printing, you then have to correctly configure the CLIENT driver.</p><p>* My OpenWRT boxes have been too underpowered to allow me to install the cups pagkages, I used the p910nd packages which implements copying of the print stream to port 9100.&nbsp; (You can read the source code and actually trace how this happens.)</p>									</div>
