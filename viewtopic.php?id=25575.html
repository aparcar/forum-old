					<p>Hi,<br />Been searching to see if it is possible to overclock the atheros ar9132 processor in the buffalo wzr-hp-g300nh and so far have not found anything.&nbsp; I plan to open up the box and add a heatsink and small fan.&nbsp; </p><p>I ask because when I run some torrents along with samba file copying, the system runs very slow with top and the gui showing cpu pegged at 100%.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, but umm, err.. I had a Linksys wrt54gs , stock 200 mhz @ 240 mhz for years with no problems- stock cooling until the last year when I added a heatsink and went for 252 mhz STABLE!&nbsp; I quit using it because the USB port I soldered onto it was too slow for my liking (USB 1).&nbsp; So, please, you honestly have no idea why overclocking is possible.</p><p>Ohh and my PC is a core quad 2.66 ghz @ 3.44 ghz with no issues and STOCK heatsink for 2 years.&nbsp; In fact, my limit for that is the motherboard/RAM.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have had 2 friends who both have EE degrees who explained that when a chip is manufactured, it is regularly &quot;binned&quot; in order to sell different speeds.&nbsp; The QX9650 3.2ghz quad core you bought could be the same exact core as my Q9400 2.66ghz which runs perfectly fine at 3.44 ghz.</p><p>So please, stop being paranoid.&nbsp; With proper load testing, one can overclock even with stock cooling.&nbsp; The key is TESTING it to see that it runs stable.&nbsp; That is what intel and other companies do when they decide what the max speed is.&nbsp; The only problem for them is that not everyone wants to pay prime $$$ for top speed.&nbsp; So many of those that pass at top speeds get sold at a lower speed.&nbsp; Comprende, senor?</p><p>So, anyone else, who has ever overclocked a router before, know how to adjust settings on the AR9132?&nbsp; Since there is no NVRAM setting, I have no idea where to start to try this evil, dangerous behavior, LOL.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>robnitro</strong> on 7 Jul 2010, 03:31)</p>

					<p>This is not a direct answer to your question but I confirm that overclocking is not dangerous. At least on my router. I have been running a WRT45GL @ 250 Mhz for mounths under Tomato firmware with no problem. Not even heating. I just upgraded that router to Backfire and it kept its overclocking value. Router still running fine.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>  _______                     ________        __

					<p>It&#039;s been a while, any progress whether it is possible to overclock the atheros processor in U-boot?</p><p>I look forward to the possibility.&nbsp; In that case I will open the system up and add heatsinks and a fan to cool the unit even though heat is not usually a problem in &quot;normal&quot; overclocks.</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=18434">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=18434</a><br />&quot;I personally think some people overreact to the heat... to me there must be carefully studied proof of instability.&nbsp; just high temp alone does not mean to me that it is exceeding the design. I think it is designed to run rather hot, they put no heatsink on it - none of the models I have seen for the AP81 routers do.&nbsp; the ar71xx chip runs up to 680Mhz with some overclocking to 800... so Atheros was pretty conservative putting the ar9130/ar9132 at 400Mhz.&quot;</p>									</div>
