					<p>Hi all,<br />I have created in a recently installed (OpenWRT 10.03.1 on a Linksys WRT160NL) a second dropbear instance listening on a non standard port (2223) of the WAN interface via Luci web interface. Then I&#039;ve allowed that traffic on externeal port 9999 to go through from an internal dropbear listening port 2223 in the firewall. When I try to connect from outside I receive no response. <br />So it goes in Luci (Network -&gt; Firewall) like:<br />Name:sshext<br />Protocol: TCP<br />Source: wan:0.0.0.0/0:9999<br />via: wan:0.0.0.0/0:2223<br />Destination: 192.168.1.1 (the router LAN ip address)</p><p>If I try to connect from inside LAN to the dropbear instance running in the port 22 it works.<br />It worked fine also in 10.03.1-RC4<br />I tried to reflash tfrom scratch twice with no success</p><p>Could you pease help me?</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>									</div>

I had the same problem with backfire 10.03.1, but on TP-Link TL-WR1043ND. I have two active instances of dropbear, one on port 22 for the internal network and one on port 2222 for access from outside. Port 2222 is opened in the firewall. If your dropbear instances are bind to specific interface, try to set them like this: <strong>System/Administration/SSH Access</strong>, <strong>interface</strong> set to <strong>unspecified</strong>. Do this for all dropbear instances. It worked for me. 5 days and no access problems so far. And just for precaution, I have this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>30 0 * * * /sbin/wifi down &amp;&amp; sleep 5 &amp;&amp; /sbin/wifi up &amp;&amp; sleep 5 &amp;&amp; /etc/init.d/dropbear restart</code></pre></div><p>in my <strong>Scheduled Tasks</strong>. This line restart the WiFi interface and all dropbear instances once a day (at 0:30 AM).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>philip_petev</strong> on 6 Feb 2012, 13:16)</p>
