					<p>Yes, but wireless will not work.&nbsp; Broadcom&#039;s bianry wireless drivers are built against the 2.4 kernel and the OpenWrt devs have had to heavily tweak them just to run on later 2.4 kernels.&nbsp; There is no way to get those drivers running 2.6, but the bcm-43xx project is writing open source drivers, but they still have quite a bit of progress to make before the drivers can be considered for OpenWrt.</p>									</div>

					<p>Appreciate all the help.&nbsp; Running out to Circuit City today to pick up the router.&nbsp; The switch on my old Linksys wrt54g went out last night so I need to pick up something.&nbsp; The Buffalo has a rebate of half off today so I definitely wanted to get one I can hack again.&nbsp; Figured while I was at it, might as well try Kamikaze.</p>									</div>
