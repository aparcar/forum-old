					<p>Hi,</p><p>Just joint as I&#039;ve been investigating a bit into Sky TV&#039;s wireless addons for their equipment in the form of a white wifi Booster (model SB601) and a black wifi adapter (model SC201).</p><p>They seem to be both the same Airties 4400 based pcb but with different coloured enclosures and different sky firmware, however according to airties website they should be wireless-N capable and have the option to change from AP to bridge etc..but skys firmware cripples them to wireless-G and hides/locks the settings.</p><p>What I want to do is reflash these sky units to the original airties firmware to unlock them and ask for help on how I can do this?</p><p>I have obtained 2 airties 4400 firmware files one from the original thread someone else posted here, which looks like the Op wanted either to do the same or request an openwrt firmware.</p><p>original request thread<br />-------------------------</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=48201">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=48201</a></p><p>And I found what looks like the current airties 4400 version from a US server - AirTies_Air4400_FW_1.7.0.24.</p><p>However looking through the original thread it looks like the cfe is locked via a dualimage setting in the nvram to stop the firmware being flashed other than sky&#039;s own, however a poster in the original thread managed to start loading firmware by turning the dualimage off.</p><p>I wonder if anyone got further with this or can they help me to flash the airties firmware above without bricking the unit.</p><p>Thanks for any help.</p>									</div>
