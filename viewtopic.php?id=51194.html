					<p>I have no idea if this could work, but I&#039;ll let you mine from a WDR4900.

					<p>ART is not just model specific, it&#039;s also highly device specific, containing wireless calibration data for your specific router. Flashing ART from a different device, but identical model might technically (appear to) work (all bets about standards/ regulatory compliance or wireless stability are off though), using it from a vastly different model however can&#039;t work at all.</p>									</div>

					<p>Of course, but sometimes they are compatible if the hardware is the same. Art partitions from my 741nv4 and 703 worked on both.<br />Its strange that the wdr3600 ART didnt work on the wdr3500 being the same hardware, the only difference is that the 3500 has 100M ethernet and the 3600 has gigabit.<br />How did you tried to restore the ART?</p>									</div>
