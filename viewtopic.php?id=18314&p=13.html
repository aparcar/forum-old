					<p>Luci-fastindex was sometimes a necessity for me to use the Luci web interface when I was using Kamikaze trunk snapshots. I was also at the time using Windows IE8; never tried Firefox or Google Chrome because the issues some had flashing with it. I didn&#039;t always have to d/l it to make the web interface work but it was buggy sometimes.</p><p>All I can say is try to do without it and try other web browsers to see what works best for you. I tried several different package options to try to personalize the router for my needs but I also found that I didn&#039;t need much configuration at all to work with wired ETHERNET only. The more you learn to configure without the web interface, more room saved for other packages.</p><p>My Dir-615, C1 is now a standby router; haven&#039;t tried Backfire on it yet.</p>									</div>

I hope OpenWrt will pick that router as a development project. Some work being done here but not a working kernel yet.</p><p>Oh yeah, on the post you had quoted, I don&#039;t think the opkg install luci-theme-openwrtlight is a good idea unless compiling. I don&#039;t know of any way to actually remove a package and replace it with a smaller one without actually losing more space. I never got the answer I was looking for in this thread about doing this properly and making space available for other packages. One thing I tried to do was estimate space available by testing a package install for fit by using the opkg install package --test in TELNET. This helped me decide quicker which packages I needed and I tested a lot of combinations to try to come up with one that worked with the least amount of flash used.</p><p>Wireless is more of an issue but there may still be some that are sharing compiled flashes. I had requested in this thread for those that share to try to come up with two compiled f/w&#039;s to address both wired and wireless applications due to the small amount of flash available.</p><p>IDK if frat&#039;s had any of these ideas addressed but he posted some back in December. IDK if he ever got wireless-N integrated either but maybe you can try one of his recent flashes: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=100067#p100067">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 67#p100067</a></p><p>Good luck; I feel there is a better working solution for these router despite the small flash space.</p>									</div>

					<p>I installed &#039;openwrt-ar71xx-dir-615-c1-squashfs-factory.bin&#039; following the steps from wiki (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-615">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-615</a>). I was not getting any internet connection when uing dd-wrt. As there was not much help there, i tried open-wrt. I have no internet connection with open-wrt too. Nothing through ethernet port nor through wifi. May be the routher has gone bad. I am trying to revert back to the original firmware. But, i am not sure how to load the original firmware now through my windows 7 pc. I am trying to follow the options given in <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/openwrtdocs/deinstalling">http://wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/openwrt … installing</a>. I am not able use mtd as the router spits back saying bad url. Obviously, it is not having internet connection. Windows 7 doesn&#039;t have tftp and the wiki says it should be less than 3mb. The original firmware is 3.8 mb. Pls help</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>matbhuvi</strong> on 5 Jun 2010, 20:30)</p>

					<p>whart is exactly your model number for the device ? vendor, full model name, full version ?</p><p>you tell, you flashed OpenWRT onto some unknown blockbox, no one can help you with unknown thing.</p><p>&gt; The original firmware is 3.8 mb.<br />Probably because internal disk is 4 mb and no larger firmaware could fit.</p><p>To restore original fw try googling for emergent recovery of your device. DD-WRT and other forums usually have a bunch of recipes. I used such to recover my TrendNet-652-1.0 device, after tweaking OpenWRT settings bricked it.</p>									</div>
