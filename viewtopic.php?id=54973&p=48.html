					<p>jFYI - with the current snapshot [05.10.2017: LEDE Reboot SNAPSHOT r4983-7d905f1 / LuCI Master (git-17.277.69962-a876daa)] it was possible to keep the configuration during update. Update took some while (10-15 min?). Directly after update, 2.4 GHz WLAN was not available, but after another reboot, it came up normally.<br />Reboot is also working (I think this was confirmed already, but just to be sure...)</p>									</div>

					<p>Apologies in advance for the completely off topic (more or less) question but I think the people here are the best people to ask.</p><p>I have the TPL C2600 and noticed that the Synology RT2600ac has very similar hardware, same number of ports, aerials and ram. The only big difference I can see is the C2600 has a 1.4Ghz IPQ8064 and the Synology has a 1.7Ghz IPQ8065</p><p>The Synology software seems very nice so I was hoping to try it out if poosible.</p><p>Synology lets you download the firmware including the uboot so I was wondering if it would be possible to install the Synolgy firmware on the C2600? </p><p>If you think it would be possible would openwrt/LEDE be the middle man to allow it? Tplink firmware -&gt; openwrt/LEDE -&gt; Synology firmware?</p><p>Any info or suggestions appreciated</p><p>Thanks guys</p>									</div>
