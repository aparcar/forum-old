					<p>hi guys,</p><p>I&#039;m confused... so we all know the 802.11g mode, a 54Mbps wireless link, but I have seen tons of &quot;boosting&quot; &amp; extending -features, by now and I don&#039;t know which of them are usable, useful and/or can be mixed...</p><p>This started with the LinkSys WRT54GS (broadcom wifi) I bought some time ago.<br />This device was claimed to have a &quot;speedboster&quot;, whatever this may be...<br />I found statements saying this is Turbo-G mode...</p><p>Well most of the current Atheros cards have a &quot;Turbo-G&quot; mode, I notice this when the madwifi-driver is loaded, anyway the madwifi driver shows this as turbo-g 54mbps for my Wistron CM9 and XR2, while there are sources on the internet which propose 108mbps to be the Turbo-G mode.... </p><p>and finally my other Buffalo WHR-54GS (broadcom wifi) do have a &quot;125mbps&quot; mode, and I think they also call it &quot;Turbo-G&quot;, because there&#039;S a Turbo-G label on the surface of this router...</p><p>last but not least, some ppl told me, that super-G only exists and works with atheros cards.... huh???</p><p>So, you may be understand my confusion now....<br />Are these modes mixable? Which of them does bring real speed-boosting?<br />Can broadcom and atheros super-G be mixed?<br />Is the speedboser feature of the WRT54GS a super-G mode?<br />Which of these features are supported by OpenWRT(by madwifi?)</p><p>Actually I&#039;m looking for the fastest possible bridge-connection between my home and my office.<br />I currently have two WRT54GS, running WDS in normal 54Mbps mode.</p><p>So I&#039;m now wondering if there is a way to tweak this connection a little bit..<br />The following solutions would be possible:</p><p>WRT54GS -- WRT54GS (current, possible add &quot;Speedboster&quot;?)<br />CM9 --- WRT54GS<br />CM9 --- Buffalo WHR-54GS<br />WRT54GS --- WHR-54GS<br />WHR-54GS ---- WHR-54GS</p><br /><p>Which of them would provide the fastest link, what do you think?<br />Does anyone have experiences with these &quot;turbo&quot; modes?</p><p>Thx a lot to everyone <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ll add a some notes:</p><p>There are two prevalent speed enhancement technologies.&nbsp; One from Broadcom (Speedbooster) and one from Atheros (Turbo-G).&nbsp; &nbsp;They are not compatible with each other and will fall back to standard 802.11g when talking to each other.&nbsp; &nbsp; Key differences are that the Broadcom approach stays with the standard 20Mhz channel bandwidth while Atheros uses 40 Mhz channels.&nbsp; &nbsp;Each has it&#039;s advantages and disadvantages.&nbsp; From what I have seen the Atheros method with high end hardware can achieve 50mb/s real throughput.&nbsp; &nbsp;Broadcom doesn&#039;t find its way on mpci cards much so there are no equivalent test for it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Most consumer routers top out around 30 to 35mb/s real throughput on either technology.&nbsp; &nbsp;In both cases maximum throughput is not possible when using WPA and their internal cpu can&#039;t handle both encryption and compression at the same time.</p>									</div>

					<p>Check your facts.&nbsp; Atheros is NOT Turbo-G it is Super-G.&nbsp; Yes this marketing speak is very confusing.</p><p>I have much more respect for the Broadcom method.&nbsp; Frame bursting tightens things up especially for single station usage it&#039;s quite good.</p><p>I *DONT* like the Atheros method because they use double the spectrum.&nbsp; It&#039;s a hideous and wastefully greedy solution in already crowded frequency band.&nbsp; &nbsp;So you already only have really channels 1, 6, and 11 that don&#039;t overlap.&nbsp; 3 whole channels that are non-interfering.&nbsp; &nbsp;With Super-G if you pick channel 1 it will use channel 6 as well to deliver that doubling effect.&nbsp; It takes up 2/3rds of the available unlicensed spectrum!&nbsp; Fine if you live in a rural area, otherwise it is irresponsible.&nbsp; &nbsp; If you have an interference source on channel 6, you will NEVER get Super-G speed anyhow because it can&#039;t use opposite ends of the spectrum, it widens from the channel you select into the adjacent ones up or down.&nbsp; &nbsp;Wherever I have had influence among my friends, I warned them away from Super-G.&nbsp; &nbsp;Atheros did later come up with something it calls &quot;Turbo Super-G&quot; which only confuses the marketing naming even further.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 28 Jun 2007, 04:29)</p>

					<p>Yeah back to the original poster, I think the existing WRT54GS is about as good as you can get with any cheap consumer gear.&nbsp; You can tweak around with the Afterburner/frame-burst settings and see how much you can add.&nbsp; To original poster, what kind of benchmarked speeds are you getting now from LAN to LAN?</p><p>I usually worry more about other tunable parameters.&nbsp; Like if it&#039;s a PtP link, turning on WPA-PSK and MAC filtering to lock out other radios.&nbsp; I also try changing other things like RTS not sure if they really helped or not.&nbsp; Interference in my area was pretty severe so that was a bigger factor to me than anything else.&nbsp; I found one link crossing my path that was using Channel 14, I believe he had found his own ILLEGAL (in the US) way to get outside the problem.</p><p>My record through thick foliage and neighborhood from one house to another, was 1200 feet. Trees all the way and my fresnel zone cutting through some houses on each side probably too.&nbsp; One end had a 24 dBi grid dish on mast about 5 feet above roofline, and a 19 dBi grid dish at about 7 feet above the roof at the other.&nbsp; Alignment by dead reckoning was a bit tedious, standing on the roof and looking down at a laptop with netstumbler.&nbsp; That was a fun on-the-edge backhaul link I ran across the neighborhood for a couple of years. Eventually the interference got too high and I had to pull it down and find other solutions.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 29 Jun 2007, 18:53)</p>
