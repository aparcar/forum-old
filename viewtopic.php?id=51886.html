					<p>I&#039;m having an issue where my router is dropping the 40MHz connections down to 20, losing the full 300mbps. I have the setting set to always use 40MHz, but it still drops it. I have also tried going to the latest trunk version to see if it would solve anything, but it seems to be the same way. I&#039;ve also tried manually setting &quot;uci set wireless.radio0.noscan=1&quot; but it did not make a difference.</p><p>Rebooting the router will restore 40MHz connections, but only for a few hours.</p>									</div>
