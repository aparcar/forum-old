					<p>I&#039;ve now an other problem.<br />After flashing OpenWRT I&#039;m not able set up the router in a repeater mode. No SSID is broadcasting. I want to connect the router with an other AP but I want to have my own net with a different IP. So I&#039;m able to connect to the AP but not able to create a virtual interface. Are there some important steps for this atheros device (WRT1900AC V1)?</p>									</div>

					<p>All of the lock-ups I&#039;ve experienced, according to the logs, are cpu spinlocks. I believe the spinlocks are a symptom of problems in the wifi driver, and this is why &gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; This conclusion was reached because the router system logs seem to always point to 5Ghz Wifi being the cause of the spinlocks.</p><p>Also, I work with a old NASA engineer who used to work with hardware on Unix systems, and I&#039;ve asked him the question about the router spinlocks. As he&#039;s very familiar with him, he said it sounds like a driver issue with wifi.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinlock">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinlock</a></p><p>Hope that helps.</p>									</div>

					<p>In my particular case I&#039;m with i.trankolov on the hanging issue.&nbsp; My CPU temp begins to increase dramatically with no visible reason (no high data transfers, no high cpu-hogging process, etc) while DDR and WIFI temps remain stable.&nbsp; The default setting for fan operation is checking every 5 minutes and what seem to me to be very high thresholds*.</p><p>I modified the fan script to kick in at lower temps, added an extra intermediate setting that kicks in well before the max setting, and set it to run every 30 seconds.&nbsp; I still see the extra cpu increases but the peak temp is now never more than 70 deg and I haven&#039;t seen a hang since making these changes (roughly 2 weeks now).</p><p>It&#039;s interesting to me that others reporting temp measurements can be 15-20 deg cooler than I ever see.&nbsp; Unless they are outdoors north of the arctic circle, there must be differences lot-to-lot that affect this.&nbsp; Unless Belkin knows of the issue that&#039;s causing the CPU thermal rise and has fixed it in V2 and other fanless routers, I would personally be leery of buying those.</p><p>* regarding high thresholds - I recall that the high fan setting would be 100 or 105 deg C.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know where the sensor is but if it isn&#039;t sensing the peak temp on the processor, then the processor temp will actually be higher than this.&nbsp; The metal on a silicon IC will self-destruct in the short term around 125C.&nbsp; And who knows, this might even be a source of a spin lock issue -- transistor switching speeds slow with heat and there may be timing issues introduced if the CPU gets too hot.</p>									</div>

Today I changed the FAN with a bigger one (50x50x10mm) and now it is cold and quiet (45C when doing nothing and no more than 58 when loaded).
