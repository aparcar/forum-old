					<p>I&#039;m not trying to break any rules. 13 channels are available in my country and even if I set my wireless domain accourdingly in OpenWRT it still follows FCC rules, which are more restrictive, so that setting is useless. To me, there simply is no obvious way to enable all channels that are available in my country. Hence my question. And all this kinda sucks, because in my area lower channels are crowded and I get 35Mbps instead if 150Mbps.</p>									</div>

					<p>Me too! I live in Spain and the legal channels are 1-13.<br />There are a lot of networks in the channels 1, 6, and 11. So I have a dirty signal that does not work at its best.. but in the channel 13 it performs much better.

					<p>check <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3700#wireless.regulatory.issues">this</a> out <br />so that&#039;s why.</p><p>And sadly this won&#039;t change because vendors (especially of consumer-devices) have no problems with this, and don&#039;t care if there are problems with aftermarked firmware&nbsp; They sell their routers as one piece (hardware+software) which will comply with the law. hardware and software of embedded devices aren&#039;t perceived separatly, and aren&#039;t certified separatly.<br />If you are hacking or tampering your router and you are breaking the law it&#039;s your choice (not the vendors fault). <br />But sadly in this logic installing openwrt or other aftermarked-firmware means tampering the certified configuration. So the only legal fallback-option is the regulatory-domain stored in the eeprom of the wifi-card (or caldata- or art-partition for integrated wifi-chips).</p><p>On older atheros-cards it was able to change the regulatory-domain in the eeprom of the card, I did this years ago on my wgt-634u. I guess this should be possible with the art-partion, too. But I never saw someone doing this (probably I&#039;m just looking in the wrong forums). But even if you change the regulatory-domain probably the CTL (Conformity Test Limits) will still restrict you. check this <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27536">thread</a> for more info.</p><p>So the main problem is that most vendors don&#039;t care about the regulatory-domain stored in hardware because they don&#039;t need to bother with it.<br />Openwrt has to!&nbsp; So there are options, but you won&#039;t find it in a precompiled openwrt-image. And that the regulatory.bin is now build into mac80211 seems to have other reasons and not to make your life miserable. So maybe it&#039;s just time, that you compile an image yourself <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 18 Jul 2012, 16:00)</p>
