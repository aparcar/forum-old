					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to setup a VPN between a WRT54G running OpenWRT with Openswan and a BEFVP41.<br />I can setup the tunnel succesfull. I see ISAKMP packages flying by. Both ends can setup the connection.<br />But once established, no traffic between subnets is possible and I also don&#039;t see and ESP packages going by.</p><p>I followed the guidelines on openswan.org and freeswan.org for setting up a net-2-net vpn. Added the iptables thing, but nothing.</p><p>Anybody an idea?</p>									</div>

					<p>firewall, NAT (have a real good look at this one...make sure you exclude NAT for the remote end&#039;s subnet), FORWARD rules, routing. Everything is suspect. Important is; do both ends agree an IPsec SA is established?</p>									</div>

					<p>Never heard of proxy arp. Will look into it.</p><p>I added a line to iptables like this one in the FreeSwan net-2-net docu:<br />iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -s 10.0.0.0/24 -d \! 192.0.2.128/29 -j MASQUERADE</p><p>According to this docu (and others) behind the &#039;-s&#039; you provide the remote subnet. Is this correct since you want to disable masquerade from the local subnet to the remote subnet ?<br />I tried both these commands (*.9.0 is my local subnet,*.123.0 is the remote subnet):</p><p>iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o vlan1 -s 192.168.9.0/24 -d \! 192.168.123.0/24 -j MASQUERADE<br />iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o vlan1 -s 192.168.123.0/24 -d \! 192.168.9.0/24 -j MASQUERADE</p><p>But it didn&#039;t solve anything.<br />Is the POSTROUTING rule correct for OpenWRT ? Or should this be INPUT or OUTPUT or FORWARD?</p><p>My VPN network setup is :</p><p>Local subnet&nbsp; &lt;====&gt; OpenWRT &lt;===&gt; Livebox &lt;===== internet =====&gt; remove VPN router&nbsp; &lt;====&gt; remote subnet<br />(192.168.9.0/24)&nbsp; &nbsp; 192.168.9.3/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (internal ip)/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(remote inet ip)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;192.168.123.0/24<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(internal ip)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (my inet ip)</p><p>Do I have to add a &#039;leftnexthop&#039; to the ipsec config because I&#039;m behind a livebox and not directly connected to the internet? I read somewhere that IPSEC traffic doesn&#039;t like to be NAT.</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenSwan version 2.4.4 as being used on OpenWRT supports NAT-T. If you&#039;re behind yet another router, you have two choices:</p><p>- The router needs to support forwarding of ESP frames (AH won&#039;t work with NAT anyways)<br />- set nat_traversal=yes in the config setup section (I&#039;m not sure how OpenSwan was compiled, this might even be the default).</p><p>In case NAT-T is being used, the traffic won&#039;t be native ESP anymore, but UDP packets on port 4500. You will have to change<br />your firewall settings to allow this port in addition to ISAKMP (UDP 500).</p>									</div>
