I am following this youtube tutorial exactly<a href="http://%20https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJjkDxt7V1g"> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJjkDxt7V1g</a> and i don&#039;t receive any conformation from putty that the ap121u is even plugged in! i have tried using it normally with just the power cable and no lights show up!</p><p>I am using the CP2102 breakout board to flash it here is the link to the exact one i have <a href="http://%20http://www.amazon.com/KEDSUM%C2%AE-CP2102-Module-Download-Converter/dp/B009T2ZR6W/ref=sr_1_1?s=pc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1458932128&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=KEDSUM%C2%AE+CP2102+Module+STC+Download+Cable+USB+2.0+to+TTL+6PIN+Serial+Converter+For+STC"> http://www.amazon.com/KEDSUM%C2%AE-CP2 … er+For+STC</a> Its exact name is &quot;KEDSUM® CP2102 Module STC Download Cable USB 2.0 to TTL 6PIN Serial Converter For STC&quot; I realized that in the video that they were using a slightly different chip, but isnt it really all the same? And could this be my problem? </p><p>I really dont want to have to buy a new TTL UART usb because getting stuff shipped where i live is a very big hassle!</p><p>Please help me! All i need is to get putty to pick up the device then from their i can take over (unless you guys have other suggestions of course then i will take those into consideration as well), </p><p>PLEASE HELP! THANK YOU SO MUCH IN ADVANCED </p><p>P.S. feel free to email me at zedo.pomart244@gmail.com, heck text me if you have to i really am desperate for help because i am in a time crunch! my number is 1-765-491-6265 </p><p>P.S.S. lets not be immature and spam my phone I will block and retaliate against you ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU SO SO MUCH!! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------EDIT--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Also, found these specs on the USB Serial connector i have <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/IC/cp2102.pdf">https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/IC/cp2102.pdf</a> don&#039;t know if these will help but its worth a try... I can only understand some of the data sheet, but most of it is confusing to me (given that I&#039;m more software, but tinkered with hardware), anyways it may help one of you guys out so why not post it. </p><p>Also a picture of everything i have<br /><a href="http://imgur.com/OFjhrzT">http://imgur.com/OFjhrzT</a></p><p>And a picture of how i hook up the pins<br /><a href="http://imgur.com/4QgvPyQ">http://imgur.com/4QgvPyQ</a></p><p>A couple in depth pictures of the serial USB<br /><a href="http://imgur.com/a/eEuX4">http://imgur.com/a/eEuX4</a></p><p>Will post a video here in a few minutes of what im doing</p><p>Once again thank you so much!</p><p>----------------------------------------------UPDATE------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>After Searching the Hak5 forums apparently you are NOT suppose to use the VCC pin at <span class="bbu">ALL</span> </p><p>Would this really hurt the alfa ap121u though? and i also read that you are suppose to use the 32mb model... somewhere else i read said that you can use the 64mb model as long as you flash it... i dont really know please help</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zedo.pomart244</strong> on 25 Mar 2016, 22:05)</p>
