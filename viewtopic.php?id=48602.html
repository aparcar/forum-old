					<p>Hello,</p><p>I seem to have bricked my TP-Link WR841N router. I hate asking in the forums, but I&#039;m really hopeless on this one and I can&#039;t seem to find a solution... </p><p>So I had OpenWRT firmware on it and wanted to go back to stock. Before going to OpenWRT, the stock firmware was actually V8, and now I decided to go to V7 and used the stock V7 Firmware downloaded from TP-Link website. I transfered the bin file (yes it was left as bin, not trx that might have been one of my serious mistakes) to the routers tmp directory and afterwards performed this command:</p><p>mtd -r write /tmp/firm7.bin firmware</p><p>It soon wrote something and said it was rebooting, well nothing happened for like over 10 mins I believe. So I turned it off. And ever since I turned on after that, it would always keep the power led on, and have all other leds constantly slowly blinking altogether. Note sure but it might be that it keeps resetting itself like every 2 seconds or something like that as the leds blink? Because in the computer I&#039;m having the network adapter as &quot;Enabled&quot;, &quot;identifying...&quot; and then again &quot;Network cable unplugged&quot;. It keeps repeating itself all the time. <br />I connected the routers wan to the laptop and set the ipv4 settings of the adapter in my laptop to 192.168.1.2 and subnet mask to 255.255.255.0&nbsp; and when I&#039;m trying to ping or telnet router at 192.168.1.1 I get <br />&quot;Destination host unreachable&quot; <br />and&nbsp; with telnet &quot;Could not open connection to the host, on port 23: Connect failed&quot;</p><p>Actually pretty much the same situation if I connect the routers cable not to WAN, but to any of the LAN slots.</p><p>When I hold the WPS/Reset button for a few seconds, the leds stop blinking and two leds remain constantly on from that point, that is the power led and the led with the &quot;lock&quot; image (the last one on the right). What changes is that it doesn&#039;t tell that that the network cable gets unplugged anymore, it just says &quot;unidentified network&quot;. I still can&#039;t ping or telnet 192.168.1.1 though...</p><p>Is there any way to fix/unbrick it or reflash the firmware, reset and get it working again?</p>									</div>

					<p>You flashed an image for a V7 WR841N to a V8 WR841N. The major version stands for the hardware version, not the software. Those two routers have completely different hardware.</p><p>It&#039;s very (very) likely you&#039;ll have to do a hardware debrick. <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd#debricking">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl- â€¦ debricking</a></p>									</div>
