					<p>Sorry for posting so many question.</p><p>I want wr710 router to be a WifiUart adapter.<br />In other words, Smart phone app will send data to Microcontroller which connect to router through OUT/IN serial port.<br />I think router&#039;s OUT/IN port is Uart port. Correct me if I am wrong.<br />Roughly I know that router has to be configure as TCP Server. I search in the forum and cannot find satisfactory post.</p><p>Appreciate any link or lead.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
