					<p>Hello guys,</p><p>I would like to setup my router in the following way: I want to tunnel my traffic through a VPN. For that purpose I would like to have 2 firewall configurations: </p><p>1) Will only tunnel specific traffic through the VPN <br />2) All traffic will be tunneled through the VPN</p><p>I know how to setup the firewall for each setting. Is there a possibility to setup rulesets for the firewall and switch between them on the fly? I could think of a putty script that will alter the iptables entries or something? I also thought of settings up a second gateway with a virtual WAN, settings up 2 tables for each gateway and then all I would do is change the gateway on my local machine to switch between the 2 settings.&nbsp; Essentially I would like to have a comfortable way to switch the configs. What will work out best here? Thanks for your time.</p>									</div>
