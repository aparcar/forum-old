					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have a WRT54GL Running Kamikaze 7.09.&nbsp; I have followed these instructions to make a repeater and it works great:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/Repeater">http://wiki.openwrt.org/Repeater</a></p><p>I would like, however, to make a similar setup for my brother.&nbsp; He needs to connect to a network that is further&nbsp; away.&nbsp; His laptop can connect to the network when he is outside his front door.&nbsp; He is authorized to use the network - we are not trying to do anything questionable.&nbsp; I gave him a router configured as above but it is unable to connect to the network.</p><p>Can I use something like a cantenna as one of the antennas and keep the other stock antenna for him to connect to locally?&nbsp; Is there a configuration change I should use to make sure the antennas are running in the right mode?&nbsp; Is there anything else I can do to make this work?</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks in advance!</p><p>David</p>									</div>
