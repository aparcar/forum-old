					<p>Yeah, I noticed that. If you look at dmesg then you will see there is an unknown symbol crypto_aead_type, which means there is another module required. Maybe there&#039;s a dependency lacking for the kmod-crypto-authenc package.

					<p>Please, leave the default router IP as 192.168.1.1. I think anyone who is smart enough to know how to flash this build is smart enough to remember the default IP for most routers.

					<p>I didn&#039;t quite understand your problem. My build is configured to use 192.168.2.1 for server and 192.168.2.1 for the client. The LAN is on 192.168.1.x. It should work out of the box, just copy the .ovpn to the client. If you made changes you are on your own.</p><p>About the web interface, create a ticket or something.

					<p>Because the router is on it&#039;s own network. I don&#039;t use Windows so I don&#039;t know how the firewall works but it could be setup to put your home network in a trusted zone I guess. Like I said, they&#039;re both on the same layer 2+3 network right so why would one answer and the other one not?

					<p>ok here is an odd one, when using the vpn at home I can ping 192.168.2.1 but the tracert shows it is putting it through 192.168.2.1 for resolution and path, when on vpn it is using 192.168.100.1 as the path and trying to resolve.

					<p>Is there a reason why you use tun instead of tap with openvpn?</p><p>The local firewall of the system blocks the packet as it does not show up using what the machine would expect ping to come over.</p><p>According to openvpn they recommend the tap tunnel for windows based systems and file shares and media streaming on your systems, it looks like my issues stem from this being a tun issue</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wesleyhey</strong> on 25 Jun 2014, 03:34)</p>

					<p>Sigh.... No, it is not a TUN issue. TUN is layer 3 routed tunnel and TAP is&nbsp; layer 2 bridging. My build uses layer 3 routing because it is far more efficient. The reason TAP is recommended for file sharing and media streaming is because it also forwards broadcast and multicast. My build has a working smcroute setup that forwards multicast for you and makes media streaming (UPnP/DLNA) work over the tunnel, so you get the best of both worlds. TUN has absolutely nothing to do with your Windows machine accepting ICMP. If you are going to refuse instructions and ignore advice you are free to set up your own config and create a thread in the general section.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>arokh</strong> on 25 Jun 2014, 09:01)</p>

					<p>Like Arokh said (and the wiki says <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3700#how.to.flash.the.firmware.to.device">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wnd … .to.device</a> ), if you flash from the original Netgear GUI, you will need the &quot;factory.img&quot; version of Openwrt firmware image.&nbsp; (Similarly the factory.img version is used with the TFTP mode for recovery.)</p><p>&quot;sysupgrade.bin&quot; is only for upgrading an existing and running Openwrt system from inside it.</p>									</div>

					<p>That is the problem I have used you build multiple times going back to a clean install using the sysupgrade -n command, which wipe all the settings the all I do is set my ddns, change up to 192.168.2.1 for home network and wireless password, I make no other changes and it still is not pinging unless u completely turn off the firewall and it pings realm slow at 2000ms times which is worse than going overseas and back</p>									</div>
