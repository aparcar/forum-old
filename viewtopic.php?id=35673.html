					<p>Good Day,</p><p>Thank you a million for OpenWrt! I have so much enjoyed using it!</p><p>Anyway, Backfire is extremely slow when using the default web interface, when applying changes.<br />(This includes the latest (10.03.1).)</p><p>It often takes a minute or more to save even simple changes. I thought maybe the little &quot;please wait&quot; pinwheel was just never stopping, so I ssh&#039;d in and ran PS and found that various commands either related to luci or other network commands are actually periodically running -- so I guess it&#039;s actually taking its jolly time!</p><p>I guess I could just be an impatient fellow, although somehow it doesn&#039;t seem right that applying a new setting should take longer then just rebooting!</p><br /><p>Am I doing something wrong? or is this the new feel? is it long term, or is this problem known&nbsp; about and considered a bug?</p><p>Thanks very much,</p><p>Jesse</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jesseg</strong> on 21 Mar 2012, 23:43)</p>

					<p>In the case of wrt54g* it seems to be due to the lack of enough resources to be able to work properly with backfire.<br />See <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=34481">this topic</a> and <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt54g">this documentation</a>.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not sure that I&#039;ve had any trouble of losing settings across a reboot or anything. Essentially, everything works fine but it&#039;s just as slow as frozen honey when trying to apply changes. (Saving changes is much faster then applying.)</p><p>Also, I have a WRT54G-TM on which I tried backfire 10.03.1 a week ago and I&#039;m sure it was slow in the same way. (The G-TM has 8M flash and 32M of ram -- which is double and double of that on the GL.)</p><p>Back to the GL with 10.03.1 on it, since you mentioned it I wanted to find out if the filesystem was full, so I did this test several times, adding to the file each time:</p><p>time cat /bin/busybox &gt;&gt; temp.big<br />(busybox is just over half a meg)</p><p>Here are the times it took for each successive try:</p><p>13 seconds<br />23 seconds<br />31 seconds<br />12 seconds<br />5 seconds<br />3 seconds</p><p>I also did a test of creating files with a few bytes each and those took virtually no time at all.</p><p>My file was able to grow to the size of 2.048M bytes. After that it didn&#039;t take any time to speak of for writing since it just gave up.</p><p>In any case, with 2 megabytes available on my flash drive, and when it takes only 13 seconds to write the first 500,000 bytes, I cannot understand why applying network changes would take 30 seconds or more.</p><p>Are there any particular things I could check for? I don&#039;t mind it being a bit technical - I&#039;ve been using openwrt since whiterussian, I&#039;ve been programming / networking in linux since slackware 3.1.</p><p>(I have not, however, managed to get an openwrt build environment set up.)</p><p>Thank you very much,</p><p>~Jesse</p>									</div>

					<p>Are you using brcm47xx or brcm-2.4 ? <br />If LuCI applies network settings it runs:<br /> /etc/init.d/network restart<br /> /etc/init.d/firewall restart<br /> /etc/init.d/dnmasq restart</p><p>How long does that take if you do it via the cli?</p>									</div>
