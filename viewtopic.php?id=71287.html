					<p>Hi !</p><p>Anyone knows how a piece of software capable to ban MAC address of WiFi clients after several failed WiFi authentication attempts?<br />sub2rbl (already installed) bans only SSH attackers.</p><p>Or the only way is to use captive portal ?</p><p>OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 / LuCI 15.05-142-gb6330a1<br />on Linksys 1900ACS v2</p><p>Thanks in advance for any suggestion(s).</p>									</div>

					<p>Cracking WPA2-PSK is generally not based on repeatedly attempting to authenticate with the AP.&nbsp; After capturing the on-air &quot;handshake&quot; of an authorized user, an offline brute-force dictionary attack can be used to test possible passphrases.</p><p>There is a ubus call to hostapd which will ban a MAC address from authenticating.&nbsp; Of course any serious attacker will randomize their MAC address.</p>									</div>
