					<p>Is it safe to assume the TP-Link Archer C7 AC1750 is a good router to install OpenWRT on and use as a regular home router?<br />I want to host storage devices on my network and use QoS packages to maintain my network bandwidth.<br />Is this thing ready for everyday OpenWRT use or is the development not there for this device yet?</p><p>I&#039;ve worked with OpenWRT before but I want to make sure this device isn&#039;t easy to brick, and I want to make sure I&#039;m not gonna waste my money on something that can&#039;t be modified.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dylanweber</strong> on 13 Aug 2013, 04:05)</p>
