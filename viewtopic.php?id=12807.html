					<p>Hi there!</p><p>I was trying to find something about this issue but had no luck...</p><p>Is there a way to use/access NVRAM from Kamikaze (2.6 kernels)?<br />I know it can be accessed via mtd but this &quot;crude&quot; approach is not very &quot;nice&quot; (read the entire partition, make changes, recalculate checksum, write changed parts back)</p><p>The main reason for that being the possibility to retain the configuration during firmware upgrade. The problem with current approach is that the configuration cannot be retained during re-flash and the &quot;late&quot; configuration of the switchports (vlans etc). The only way is to prepare a specific image which include the configuration to be flashed to a specific device... not very nice... <br />The idea is to make the /etc a tmpfs &quot;partition&quot; and populate if at boot. When you make some changes, and screw things up... just reboot and you&#039;re back as nothing happened... after testing, issue a &quot;save config&quot; command which will take the tmpfs &quot;/etc&quot;&nbsp; tgz+base64 it and store it in NVRAM (for brcm and other boards) or in a separate partition where possible (x86...) - something like what&#039;s done in freewrt.</p><p>So, I checked the &quot;nvram patch&quot; for the WR on 2.4 kernel... as I understood, the &quot;nvram access&quot; is actually divided in two parts, the user-space &quot;nvram utility&quot; and the &quot;kernel nvram r/w utils&quot;, right?&nbsp; <br />Some time ago I just tried to apply/compile that patch on a 2.6 kernel (really a quick try, nothing fixed/changed...) but it seems there are some &quot;low level&quot; functions missing in the underlaying &quot;platform patches&quot; (write to nvram)...</p><p>Did anyone managed to get the nvram working again under 2.6 kernels?</p><p>Or, are there any suggestions on how to accomplish this in some other (more elegant?) ways?</p><p>Kind regards,<br />M.Culibrk</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mculibrk</strong> on 2 Oct 2007, 12:25)</p>
