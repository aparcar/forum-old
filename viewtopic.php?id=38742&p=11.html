I might consider switching to underscore in the future.</p><p>As far as building is concerned I package only three files: <br />/etc/init.d/adblock<br />/etc/rc.d/S11etc_configs<br />/etc/uci-defaults/99-setup</p><p>First file is the adblock, second is the script which sets up different configs for different slider positions and the last one is the script which sets everything up on first boot. If you&#039;re already on my build you can just copy the file from /rom/etc/uci-defaults/99-setup, copy it from the router to your build machine, modify it to your liking and include it in your files as /etc/uci-defaults/99-setup.</p><p>PS. Adblocking is based on bole5&#039;s script and the S11etc_configs is pretty much what manishgkasera posted a few pages back. I just added a few default settings in uci-defaults to make the slider useful. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Stangri,&nbsp; I&#039;ve been curious about the LEDE project, but I didn&#039;t see an image builder in the downloads and have been too lazy to setup the toolchain for buildroot.&nbsp; Is LUCI available in the build environment?&nbsp; The documentation just talks about setting up the UCI.&nbsp; Also do you happen to remember what kernel version is used?</p>									</div>

					<p>@petiepooo I have no more influence over LEDE stable release than you do. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I&#039;ve been running LEDE on my only home router for months now, starting from revision 8xx and it&#039;s now up to 16xx and I&#039;m still on LEDE. I update the revisions on my router at least once a week. For my own purposes the current LEDE builds are stable, any time I&#039;ve had any issues it was more to do with how I build images rather than anything to do with LEDE code.</p><p>My advise to you would be to pick the most recent LEDE build and if it works for you for a week stay on that until LEDE is officially released. Or if this is device for a remote installation where you won&#039;t have access to it from now on, you might be better off with the 15.05.1-based image.</p><p>I will not be updating the 15.05.1 image tho, while the LEDE images are likely to enjoy new features, like the upcoming @dibdot&#039;s travelmate package (and more than likely I will migrate public image from my own adblock to @dibdot&#039;s adblock package as well) -- not sure how important that is for you.</p><p>BTW, I totally forgot to update this thread, I&#039;ve started my own thread in community releases as I didn&#039;t want to spam this one with the information about my builds: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=66391">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=66391</a></p>									</div>
