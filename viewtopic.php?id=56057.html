					<p>Hi, </p><p>I&#039;ve got a EN-4000 router from Encore Networks <br />and I&#039;m developing a driver to access several of this devices at once<br />through a CLI.</p><p>I was wodnering (taking a Cisco router as example) <br />if the files under /etc/config are the running config files or the startup config&nbsp; files<br />or even if this differentiation can be made in the OpenWrt enviornment.<br />If so, how can I access each?</p><p>I&#039;m still not entirely sure how this enviornment works and would appreciate if someone could clarify this.</p><p>Thank you</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>francisco.maass</strong> on 2 Mar 2015, 23:20)</p>
