					<p>Greetings, OpenWrt community!</p><p>After an overwhelming amount reading on the Internet it seems that this decade old device is not listed anywhere, not even on the manufacturer webpage:</p><p>Basic info:</p><p>D-Link<br />Model No.: DI-624<br />H/W Ver.: E1&nbsp; F/W Ver.: 5.00<br />FCC ID: KA2DI624E1</p><p>Specific info from components:</p><p>ATHEROS<br />AR2316A-00<br />B29561C<br />0536</p><p>RAM (16MB?)<br />ESMT<br />ML12L128168A</p><p>FLASH (4MB?)<br />MX<br />25L3205AMC-20G</p><p>SWITCH<br />IC+<br />IP175C</p><p>From the general guidelines I would guess it might run OpenWrt but I&#039;m utterly lost as to which firmware I should try. I wouldn&#039;t mind experimenting if anyone can guide me because this router is no longer supported and as such is, for all purposes, already a brick.</p><p>Any help is appreciated!</p>									</div>

					<p>That&#039;s also an ath5k chip, which while they were good back in the day, only runs b and g wifi.</p><p>If you have serial access to the bootloader you could try some of the generic images in the /atheros directory.</p>									</div>
