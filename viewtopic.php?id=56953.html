					<p>Hello! I changed default web server httpd to lighttpd in my Raspberry Pi 2, to run some php features. Everything is OK, include luci access. But when I install a package via luci (system &gt; software), return the following errors (example with &quot;luci-theme-openwrt&quot; package, because all packages installed via luci return same erros):</p><p><em>Collected errors:<br /> * pkg_run_script: package &quot;luci-theme-openwrt&quot; postinst script returned status 255.<br /> * opkg_configure: luci-theme-openwrt.postinst returned 255.</em></p><p>Because of this error, the package is not installed correctly via luci. I use quite remote access via luci and this error prevents me from installing packages remotely. When i connect locally by ssh on putty and install packages, there are no errors and the package is installed correctly. Package removal works perfectly via luci. Anyone have any idea about this error and how to fix it?</p><p>Appreciate any help!</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for the answer, <strong>valentt</strong>! I believe it is a bug with very low priority for developers and now i will not add it to the list yet, since i could adjust my system to my needs and the constant remote packages installation is no longer needed. If more users encountering this bug, then it would be necessary to take it to the attention of developers.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mbarriles</strong> on 25 Apr 2015, 21:30)</p>
