					<p>I got nodogsplash installed and running perfectly, but now I want the splash page to be a html file on an external web server (like <a href="http://www.yourdomain.com/splash.html)">www.yourdomain.com/splash.html)</a>.<br />Nodogsplash blocks all outgoing connections to any server/site and I can&#039;t figure out, how to allow an unauthorized user to connect to the external splash.html.<br />You got no option to define your splash.html&#039;s location in the nodogsplash.conf, so I tried to edit the (local) /etc/nodogsplash/htdocs/splash.html to redirect or show an iframe of my external splash page (<a href="http://www.yourdomain.com/splash.html">www.yourdomain.com/splash.html</a>). No success.</p><p>I need the splash.html to be on my web server, because I want to run some scripts, so that the users have to like our Facebook fanpage to get full access to our wifi network.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, I finally got the iframe working. I really dont know how I didnt notice the firewall option in the conf file.<br />Apparently Facebook has like over thousands of servers and ip addresses, so is it possible to allow by DNS not by IP?</p>									</div>

					<p>I meant specific networks as a bunch of subnet ranges. Like 31.13.0.0/16.<br />As far as I know you would need to patch nodogsplash to match facebook.com.</p>									</div>
