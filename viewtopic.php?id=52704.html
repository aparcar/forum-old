					<p>I dont have this router, and I know very little about it. The Archer C7 is supposed to be more or less the same as WDR7500.</p><p>There is documentation here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr7500">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr7500</a><br />I read there that 5GHz is likely to never be supported.</p><p>Perhaps you dont get answers because the WDR7500 is discussed here: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=44201">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=44201</a> and people will not answer questions when the answer is already available.</p>									</div>
