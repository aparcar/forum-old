					<p>I managed to get a precompiled copy of Kamikaze on one of my La Fonera&#039;s using very explicit instructions - instructions that didn&#039;t exactly explain themselves very well. Obviously they worked, but I didn&#039;t understand what I was doing. (Ok, I knew *what* I was doing, I just didn&#039;t understand all the parameters, or why they were used.)</p><p>At this point, I have built a fresh copy from source, and I would like to give it a go. I have a few questions, though.</p><p>1) I already have OpenWRT installed, replacing the FON firmware. Is there an easier way to try my new image - or am I back to redboot.<br />2) Once the partitions are setup in the flash, how do you know when to change them? Do you need to change them for every new image?<br />3) Can you try out an image without flashing it? (load it directly to RAM, bypassing the FLASH?)</p><p>I&#039;d like to help out as a beta tester of sorts, while I figure out how to integrate my own project on the side, but the Kamikaze documentation is a bit slim - the &quot;Documentation&quot; on the site is all White Russian based.</p><p>Note - since I&#039;m attached to my FPGA target board, I have a serial console all the time. I also have a Xilinx compatable JTAG cable, which could be adapted to the EJTAG port with a bit of wiring.</p><p>Alternately, is there a working HOWTO site. I&#039;m just trying to get bootstrapped to where I can download my own images at will.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
