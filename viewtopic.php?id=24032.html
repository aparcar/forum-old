					<p>I am currently developing a WIFI termial.<br />I would like to install a 2nd operating System (OS) on NAND flash memory. The card&nbsp; on which I develop is the MikroTik RB411.<br />I am having some problems with the development phase:</p><p> 1. Is the RouterBOOT stored in the ROM ? If yes, how do we proceed to modify it ?<br /> 2. Do we have the possibility to change the booting system?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bbssyy23</strong> on 26 Mar 2010, 18:13)</p>
