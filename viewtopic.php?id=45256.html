					<p>I was trying to install openwrt on my TP-link WDR4300 router.</p><p>Steps:<br />1. flashed squashfs-factory.bin image and restarted router<br />2. used putty to access router at 192.168.1.1 (telnet) and created password<br />3. used putty to access router at 192.168.1.1 (ssh) with root and new password - successful<br />4. tried to download packages using opkg update - unsuccessful<br />5. unable to download packages with error returned as (bad address, wget =1) - no internet connectivity, I figured<br />6. realized router and modem ip address is clashing<br />7. changed modem ip to 192.168.1.2 and set dhcp on modem with address allocation starting from 192.168.1.3<br />8. still cannot download the packages (router still accessible via 192.168.1.1)<br />9. found this : <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=38122">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=38122</a> and followed (most of) the instructions to change ip of router, i.e.:<br />uci set network.lan.proto=dhcp<br />uci commit network</p><p>uci set network.fallback=interface<br />uci set network.fallback.ifname=eth0<br />uci set network.fallback.proto=static<br />uci set network.fallback.ipaddr=192.168.1.1<br />uci set network.fallback.netmask=255.255.255.0<br />uci commit network</p><p>10. restarted the router and modem<br />11. from modem, new router ip is 192.168.1.4<br />12. problem starts: no longer able to ssh into router on 192.168.1.4 (connection timed out), also unable to ping router on 192.168.1.4 (request timed out)</p><p>I realized the instructions above for changing the router ip was for WR703N and had thought it was reasonable enough that it should work for my WDR4300 too. Apparently it doesn&#039;t or I have made a mistake somewhere.</p><p>Can anyone out there help me out?</p><p>Cheers</p>									</div>
