					<p>Hi,<br />I have an &quot;Alice Gate 2 PLUS Wi-Fi&quot; (not the business, not voip). It is an &quot;Us Robotics Wireless MAXg ADSL Gateway&quot;, re-branded by Pirelli Broadband solutions, re-branded by Alice.</p><p>I can install successfully the US Robotics&nbsp; firmware for&nbsp; Wireless MAXg ADSL Gateway, and I&#039;m almost sure it is the 9108. The firmware I installed is &quot;USRAGW2-PLUS_fs_kernel_3.04L.01.-100727_2130&quot;<br />I installed this image using the procedure described here: <a href="http://www.ilpuntotecnicoeadsl.com/forum/index.php/topic,3781.msg40859.html#msg40859">http://www.ilpuntotecnicoeadsl.com/foru … l#msg40859</a></p><p>You have to short-circuit the two pins marked red, THEN power on the router; if it doesn&#039;t work, try fast intermitting the short circuit between the two pins while power on and booting.</p><p>If success, the power led becomes red and no other led is active; you can remove the short circuit.<br />At this point, you connect via ethernet on ETH1, the ip address of the router will be 192.168.1.1, you can connect with your browser at <a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a>/ and upload a firmware image.<br />You have to adjust your computer lan settings before doing this, in example a static 192.168.1.2 mask 255.255.255.0 , because when the router is in this &quot;upload firmware&quot; modality, it doesn&#039;t serve any ip address to your PC.</p><p>In some circustamces, before uploading a new firmware it can be useful to erase the flash, upolading this blank fake firmware: AGW2-PLUS_psi_clear</p><p>So flash two times, the first with AGW2-PLUS_psi_clear and the second with the firmware you want to use; repeat the procedure short-circuiting the 2 pins marked in red.</p><p>This procedure works for uploading the US robotics firmware, and it unlocks my router for different uses, purposes and providers other than ALICE..<br />BUT.. I would like to upload openwrt because I need to use this machine as a WI-FI CLIENT and then as a&nbsp; router between the WI-FI and the Ethernet, simoultaneusly; and maybe to run software on it.<br />I want to connect to the NETGEAR wi-fi router of my neighbour and then have internet for my PCs on the 4 lan ports of the 9108. How to do this ? Please help. (And I&#039;m ready to contribute immediately as I can to port openwrt on this machine, just tell me how and what to do)</p><p>Marco</p>									</div>
