					<p>Here&#039;s the issue:</p><p>1. Have a non-Openwrt router as internet gateway. It serves wireless and wired clients.<br />2. Among the wireless clients one is an Asus WL-550GP with K7.09 based on kernel 2.4<br />3. It&#039;s setup in sta mode and has a static IP assigned to the wireless/wan interface<br />4. If no LAN clients are connected to the Asus, I cannot access (ssh or even ping) it from the wireless network (yes, port 22 is open). I need this ability because this Asus acts as a network music player (running mpd) besides sometimes providing internet access to computers in the same room.<br />5. All&#039;s well if I have a machine connected to the LAN port of Asus. I can see the &quot;AIR&quot; and &quot;LANx&quot; lights blinking etc. I can disconnect the machine after a few minutes and all&#039;s still well - meaning I can access ssh amd mpd.</p><p>How do I debug the issue? Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>
