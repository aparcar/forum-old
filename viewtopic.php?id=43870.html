					<p>Hi,</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; We are trying to build openwrt and port it into Pandaboard with OMAP4 processor. This board uses WL12xx (WL1271) wifi chip. We are facing issues in bringing up the wifi. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; If wifi is enabled in station mode, first time after flashing it will connect. But, immediately disconnects and says that wlan0: Beacon loss detected. connection to the AP lost. After that connecting again doesn&#039;t works.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; If wifi is enabled in AP mode, we are not able to see any response from the board. We used wireshark to capture the packets. We are seeing only the request sent and the pandaboard is not sending back any response.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; It looks like some configurations we are missing.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Can someone help us in doing that?. As we are new to this activity, we are not much familiar with menuconfig. So please someone help us in selecting the packages needed for wifi?. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks in advance.</p><p>--<br />Regards,<br />Siva S</p>									</div>
