					<p>Just installed WhiteRussian RC6 on my WRT54G 2.2, no problems and telnet/ssh/dhcpd/etc up and running. Can connect to the web server, the index.html redirects to /cgi-bin/webif.sh, but the page then served is blank! (webif.sh in turn is set to exec ./webif/info.sh). I have not tampered with any settings (yet), so this seems to be default. (yet I&#039;ve found nothing in doc/faq/forum, <a href="http://www.x-wrt.org">www.x-wrt.org</a> is down)</p><p>Any ideas?</p>									</div>

					<p>Not a cache problem. Same problem after clearing firefox cache. And IE actually gives an error: &quot;Cannot connect to server&quot;! I think it has to do with the httpd on OpenWRT, here is why...</p><p>Had a look at what&#039;s happening using Ethereal and Charles (HTTP debug proxy). Client connects to openwrt ok, sends request, receives HTTP/200 OK and data (seems like it sends everything, can see the &lt;/html&gt; in the data), but it seems like the server terminates the connection afterwards in a way that the client does not accept (Charles gives a &quot;RemoteServerClosedConnectionException&quot;). So this leads me to think this is about the httpd and the way it terminates connections? Maybe some setting in httpd conf file?</p><p>Anyone?</p>									</div>

					<p>Grrr.. really annoying</p><p>The same problem exists with thttpd. Lighttpd displays the pages ok, but can not run as root and thus the updating (requiring root privs to run nvram) fails with the error message &quot;/bin/sh: nvram: not found&quot;, and there does not seem to be a workaround. </p><p>Anyone???</p>									</div>
