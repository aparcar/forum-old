					<p>I place a script in /etc/uci-defaults in my own compiled firmware for auto configuring everything for the router at first boot, to avoid the hassle of manually configuring after every sysupgrade or reverting settings to factory defaults. I&#039;m not sure whether this is the best choice, but I found it quite convenient for me. </p><p>My question is, how can I automatically reboot my router after the uci-defaults script is executed? Adding `reboot` to the script leads to an infinite loop, probably because the script does not exit properly, and then it is not deleted and therefore executed again during the next boot. </p><p>I have this question because sometimes I need to upgrade the router remotely via SSH (I know this is not recommended, but I have to), and I find that sometimes a reboot is needed to make the router work properly after the auto configuration, while a cold reset is not an option. I searched in the forum before posting, and I found <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=49249">this thread</a> which has a very similar question, but it has been unanswered for a year. </p><p>I&#039;m wondering if anyone knows how to achieve this, or have better suggestions. Thanks a lot in advance!</p><p><strong>Update:</strong><br />Unfortunately, I have tried all the methods provided below, but I still encounter an infinite reboot. So here is my script named <strong>99-uci-703</strong>, I will appreciate if you can tell me how to modify the script. <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

Thank you for sharing your experience! <br />As for the naming of the script, I&#039;ve looked into the wiki of UCI, but there&#039;s not an explicit explanation to the naming.
