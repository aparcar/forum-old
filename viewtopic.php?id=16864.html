					<p>xMff suggested setting up two separate networks and forwarding between them.&nbsp; The wiki has an <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/KamikazeConfiguration/NonBridgedWiFi">outline of setting up the two networks</a> and then the uci /etc/config/firewall is pretty simple:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;forwarding&#039;      
        option &#039;src&#039; &#039;lan&#039;

					<p>I have also noticed this problem on my WGT634U (I don&#039;t have any other routers running an svn kamikaze at the moment). I changed my firewall config to allow forwarding on the lan zone. Not 100% of the implications of this, but at least it helps narrow down the problem. It does seem to me that traffic within the bridge should not go into the forwarding rules.</p>									</div>

					<p>it seems that part of the problem was that I had an old firewall configuration file in my build (did that myself).<br />and kmod-ipt-nat was not selected, but I&#039;m still not completely sure if that one is necessary</p>									</div>

					<p>Phorn,</p><p>Thanks for the clarification.&nbsp; In my particular case I&#039;m trying to do an Ethernet bridge between two radios (Ubiquiti Nanostation 5&#039;s -- Atheros 2312) in which case src=wan,dest=lan (along with src=lan, dest=wan) provides the desired bridging, so I really don&#039;t need a firewall nor masquerading (NAT).&nbsp; I&#039;m seeing the same problem (observed in r12928 &amp; r13015 of the development trunk) everyone else is with regard to the &#039;bridge not bridging,&#039; even when the firewall and NAT router aren&#039;t included in the build.&nbsp; In order to replicate the suggested workaround, I include the firewall in the build, so that I can then configure it as suggested in this thread, and then perform an&nbsp; /etc/init.d/firewall stop followed by a restart of wifi.&nbsp; Then and only then do the packets begin to fly, and I&#039;m only seeing ~7-8 Mbps throughput over a 54Mbps link (when using iperf running on the NS&#039;s).&nbsp; It still seems to be seriously broken as far as I&#039;ve been able to tell.</p><p>vector108</p><br /><div class="quotebox"><cite>phorn wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>src=wan,dest=lan would allow any hosts on the internet to connect to any machine on your local network.&nbsp; Perhaps not the best for security and the &quot;option masq 1&quot; in your wan interface allows IP masquerading (known as network address translation) and does all the neccessary config already.</p><p>src=lan,dest=lan is the correct one as traffic on the bridge does pass through the firewall on the way through to the other side, and I assume newer versions of the kernel are trying to be flexible by allowing such traffic to also be blocked if you so choose.&nbsp; The only exception to this is two wired clients where the switching is done in hardware.</p><p>The reason this is confusing is that OpenWRT&#039;s default policy is &quot;block all&quot;, with no knowledge of such specific cases like when you are using a bridge.&nbsp; IMO, they should include lan&lt;-&gt;lan in the default configs.</p></blockquote></div>									</div>
