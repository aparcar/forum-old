					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am going to be armoring a WRT54G (S Maybe?) and mounting it on a mast outside my house. My main goal is to be able to connect to a wifi network a couple of streets over.</p><p>I am going to install OpenWRT on the router and then set it up as a bridge between the ethernet and wifi traffic. The other side will probably have a regular antenna... </p><p>What do you think of these antenna&#039;s. Do you think they are overkill?</p><p><a href="http://www.wade-antenna.com/Wade/Parabolic.PDF">http://www.wade-antenna.com/Wade/Parabolic.PDF</a></p><p>If I got the best antenna listed on that sheet, I would have a gain of 23 dBi. I am not sure, but I believe that the router has an output power of about 30 mW. This would give me a power output of 690 mW. Does this sound right?</p>									</div>
