					<p>I think I might not have used nano on my own GL, so that&#039;s a wee bit stupid of me.

					<p>I am just curious why you replace 6in4 package with 6to4 package. Also, someone in the IRC channel mentioned that 6to4 doesn&#039;t support tunnel, IIRC. BTW, if my ISP supports IPv6, are these packages, i.e. 6to4, 6scripts, 6tunnel, LuCI, and aiccu, enough to run an IPv6 as a starter or do we need more?</p>									</div>

					<p>I didn&#039;t replace it, I added it, you could use either of them or both <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> I&#039;m aiming for something that even users of older hardware can use to experiment with IPv6, be it via 6in4 (i.e. he.net), aiccu (sixxs) or 6to4.</p><p>I think that if your ISP gives out v6 addresses this might actually not work, I hadn&#039;t considered that possibility yet <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p>									</div>

					<p>I sure would like to compile/build my own firmware for Fry&#039;s FR-54RTR router (an AR71XX platform) with an IPv6 capability that will be used to connect to an apartment WiFi that supports IPv6. Having to know nothing about IPv6, I sure would like to know if you and/or anyone out here can chime in to help on what packages are needed. This way, I can turn the router into an IPv6 capable through a WiFi connection.</p>									</div>

					<p>Totally depends on how v6 is implemented. Can you get a subnet, or just some addresses? Maybe you need a dhcpv6 client or only something to pass through the traffic...</p>									</div>
