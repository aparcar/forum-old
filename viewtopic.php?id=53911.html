					<p>I&#039;m using Hurricane Electric as my IPv6 tunnel, using my /64 routed subnet address as my endpoint (i.e. ip6addr, e.g. the ::2 address).&nbsp; Let&#039;s call it 2001:470:aaaa:bbbb::2.</p><p>However, I also have a /48 block which I&#039;m routing through my network (in other words, I use the /64 only to establish the tunnel, and use the /48 on my LAN).&nbsp; This is what is specified in ip6prefix, and as expected (and desired), the ::1 address on the first /64 of that /48 is what is assigned to br-lan.&nbsp; Let&#039;s call it 2001:470:cccc::1.</p><p>Ideally, when the router itself is reaching out to the IPv6 Internet, I&#039;d prefer it source from 2001:470:cccc::1, but it&#039;s actually sourcing from 2001:470:aaaa:bbbb::2 (since that&#039;s the &quot;closest&quot; address according to the routing table).&nbsp; I know there is a way to set preferred_lft in Linux to &quot;de-prioritize&quot; the aaaa:bbbb address, such that it will &quot;prefer&quot; the cccc address, but I&#039;m not sure how this is accomplished via UCI configuration.</p><p>Any pointers?</p><p>Rodney</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rhester72</strong> on 11 Nov 2014, 03:07)</p>

					<p>Easiest way would be to simply remove the option ip6addr of the he.net interface. As long as another interface i.e. lan is active with an address from the /48 everything should be fine.</p>									</div>

					<p>Worked - thank you very much for the tip!&nbsp; I thought the v6 endpoints were required, but just the v4s (plus the default route, of course) did the trick!</p><p>Rodney</p>									</div>

					<p>You can also set prefered source addresses in the routing table by adding a &#039;src&#039; tag to a route, not sure exactly where to put it in uci, but on my desktop linux I do</p><p>sudo ip -6 route change to fd74:cd4f:be19::/64 dev wlan0&nbsp; proto kernel&nbsp; metric 256&nbsp; &nbsp; src fd74:cd4f:be19:0:2677:3ff:fe59:a39c</p><p>to make sure i use static site local from addresses when talking site locally.</p>									</div>
