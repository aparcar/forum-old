					<p>Hi Guys ! </p><p>I already read alot about this topic, but do not get a right answer on my problem:</p><p>The Setup:<br />- we use an wrt54gl with whiterussian (last version 0.9 ?, think ist not so important here) for giving lan devices internet access<br />- an openvpn server with typical roadwarrior config is running on this wrt.<br />&nbsp; so, many clients can connect to the server from internet and have full access to lan devices<br />- all internal devices (pc´s, servers, printers ...) have full access to internet<br />- one pc in lan should connect via cisco client to a cisco vpn server via pptp.</p><p>the problem:<br />The internal pc cant connect to the external vpn server via the cisco vpn client</p><p>a partial not ideal solution:<br />if i install the package &quot;kmod-ipt-nat-pptp&quot; i can connect to the cisco vpn client<br />BUT: now it isn´t possible to access internal pc´s from internet via the openvpn server. I have still access to the openvpn server ip itself (via openvpn connection) but it seems that the routing to the internal devices is not working</p><p>if i deinstall the &quot;kmod-ipt-nat-pptp&quot;-package access is working again from extern, but the cisco connection intern-&gt;external vpn server dosent work.</p><br /><p>would be nice if someone can give me<br />a solution (would be great)<br />a hint<br />or a right direction for reading more about the reasons</p><p>Greetings from Germany, Dresden</p><p>Robert</p>									</div>
