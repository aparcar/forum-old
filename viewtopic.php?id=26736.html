					<p>I saw some postings about 3 weeks back that said 10.3.1 was only a few days away, so I held off doing some stuff till it&#039;s released.</p><p>Could anyone give an indication of how soon or far away it may be, I realise that the date may slip but if it&#039;s before this weekend I&#039;ll wait else I may try 10.3</p><p>Thanks in advance and apologies for the annoying question</p>									</div>

					<p>If released now It would be the same as RC3 is.<br />If not, a RC4 should come from. And so on until no complains, then last RC gets renamed to final.<br />So maybe Xmas is always a good date to launch something.</p>									</div>
