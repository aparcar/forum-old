					<p>I&#039;m a long term user of OpenWRT via Gargoyle GUI. I recently upgraded my router from a TP-Link 1043ND to the Archer. Everything is functional except when the router is reset- it cannot complete the PPPoE login to my VDSL modem (SmartRG505n). This problem did not exist with the 1043ND.</p><p>To get rid of the problem I can:<br />- power cycle both modem and router<br />- power cycle modem<br />- disconnect/reconnect the ethernet cable</p><p>The problem exists both in Gargoyle v1.9 (Chaos Calmer) and in v1.8.1 (Barrier Breaker). Assume it is actually a DHCP issue because another user on Gargoyle using DHCP, not PPPoE has the same issue.</p><p>Believe this is the same root problem as in these two topics...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=55383">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=55383</a><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=61498">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=61498</a></p><p>I also found the following OpenWRT ticket (opened 15 months ago) which covers the issue: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/18680.">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/18680.</a> </p><p>We tried out the proposed fix (re-ordering the VLAN) without success, similar to the most recent poster about 6 months ago. I&#039;ve updated this with our findings.</p><p>Clearly there are people on this site as well as a handful of Gargoyle users who are experiencing the issue with OpenWRT and this router connecting to several different DSL or cable modem. The ticket is fairly old and I cannot tell if it is active... is there a way to attract some attention and hopefully find a resolution for this issue??</p><p>Thanks...</p><p>Link to thread on Gargoyle site: <a href="https://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=8356">https://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/v â€¦ amp;t=8356</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>11freddy</strong> on 3 Apr 2016, 17:51)</p>
