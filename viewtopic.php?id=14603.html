					<p>Hi boys and girls...<br />Searching over the net there is lack of information about the new model of the Fonera.<br />Ok, i&#039;ve two Fon 2200, and I like it...<br />Thanks to it I&#039;ve discovered this wonderful software and *cough* DD-WRT *cough*.<br />There are info about I2C for Fon 2100, but not for 2200. I want to create my own I2C module for it, using the 2 free GPIO: power and WLAN led, that are GPIO 7 and 2. I&#039;ve seen that pins are three stateable, so I can port an old version of the I2C bus that I made in the past for PIC 16 family (Microchip MCU), creating a 2 wire I2C bus (without Master arbitration, that will add more difficult to all..).<br />I&#039;ll inform you about the progress of the project.<br />If someone has some info please feel free to contact me by PM.<br />Thanks</p>									</div>
