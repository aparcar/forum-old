If there is anyone who never contributed but wants to experience doing so, grab the patch. It&#039;s trivial, not copyrightable, you don&#039;t even have to ask. Contributing for the first time is difficult so a no-brainer like this is ideal to get involved.</p><p>As for mwlwifi, if nothing in your package list sets USE_RFKILL it will silently not build. Fixed it and fired a build with all the other changes from earlier this day. Will postpone the next series to tomorrow so I can include the bump to 4.8-rc3 which already contains the timer fix.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>Villeneuve wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>As you appear to be trying to cover the gamut, &quot;fs exfat&quot; breaks.</p></blockquote></div><p>Covering base works as that still builds in reasonable time.
