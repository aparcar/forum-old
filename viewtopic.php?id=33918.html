					<p>According to <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd#usb.1.1.port">this</a> wiki page, USB (at least for 1.1) is doable on my board, but I can&#039;t make sense of the two pictures and the accompanied instructions attached in that page.</p><p>Is there a place I could find more detailed/clear instructions on how to do this? Also, from those who have attempted this or have it installed and functioning, does it affect the stability/performance of the device? Are there any pitfalls I should be aware of before attempting this?</p>									</div>

					<p>you solder your D+ wire to R185 and your D- wire to R183 (in both cases to the side facing to the middle of the board. then solder a wire to gnd (there are plenty of points) and connect a 7805 (or better some step-down converter) to the power jack and basically you&#039;ve got everything you need for usb (like described in the wiki).</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks MSB, a few more queries: what is a &quot;7805&quot; and where do I get this? When you say &quot;power jack&quot;, do you mean on the USB itself or somewhere else? </p><p>As you&#039;ve probably gathered by now, I am a n00b, not an electronics engineer, though I&#039;ve done a bit of soldering in my time on various electronic devices, but nothing complex.</p><p>Last query - I take it I could only use USB 1.1, but not 2.0 and if that is so, are there any side effects - is the board working as expected once I put the USB in place (provided I do it correctly, of course)? Many thanks!</p>									</div>
