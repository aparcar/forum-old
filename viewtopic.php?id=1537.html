					<p>Hi</p><p>I wanted to start from clean on my WRT so I reflashed it via TFTP with OpenWRT the same version that I was running before. I noticed that after doing so the filesystem was the same as before with the packages and settings the same. Howcome my filesystem was not replaced with the reflash of the firmware ?</p><p>I spoke to Rodent and he said I should try a &quot;mtd erase OpenWrt&quot; I tried this and it looked like it worked but the files in certain directorys such as /etc/init.d/ are the real files not symlinks anymore. Also when I try change my password with passwd it tells me I cant as there is a problem with some file.</p><p>Any help would be appriciated thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Erasing the flash is one part.. Resetting the filesystem on the jffs partition is separate.

					<p>firstboot only runs if it can&#039;t find a valid jffs file system, and a good thing too.</p><p>When upgrading, the jffs already exists so firstboot doesn&#039;t run.</p>									</div>
