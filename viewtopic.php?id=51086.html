					<p>First, let me start of by saying that I am new to electronics. I&#039;ve wanted to get started on electronics and microcontrollers for quite some time now, and thought that this would be a great project to start with.</p><p>What I bascily want to do is make an WiFi access point.</p><p>So I was thinking of getting one of these:<br /><a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Easy-Link-M-mini-ar9331-openwrt-ultra-low-power-wireless-module-ultra-small-size/1766105685.html">http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Easy-Lin … 05685.html</a></p><p>It&#039;s based on the AR9331 (Found the datasheet here: <br /><a href="http://www.openhacks.com/uploadsproductos/ar9331_datasheet.pdf">http://www.openhacks.com/uploadsproduct … asheet.pdf</a> ).</p><p>Am I correct to assume that the chip should support up to 5 Ethernet ports, but as the board only has pinouts for 1 Ethernet, I can only add the last 4 by some major (relative to me being new) hacking?</p><p>Am I also correct to assume that the Net_TX and Net_RX ports (4) are the ones that needs to be hooked up to an Ethernet slot/shield (What do you call it?) - If so, what more would I need to add an Ethernet interface to the board?</p><p>I really hope this is the right place to ask such questions. I really want to get started on electronics and custom OpenWRT boards.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, that board only supports 1 port without major hacking.<br />You either need an RJ45 jack with builtin magnetics or a seperate transformer.<br />Example schematics: <a href="http://8devices.com/media/files/8dev-0700_0002_sb_SCH.pdf">http://8devices.com/media/files/8dev-07 … sb_SCH.pdf</a></p>									</div>
