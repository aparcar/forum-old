					<p>Hello,</p><p>I bought a Cisco E3000 router. It appears that as of this moment the only WRT type system I can put on the router is available from DDWRT. I would however much rather put OpenWRT on the router.</p><p>Are there plans to develop OpenWRT for the E3000?</p><p>For some time now I have been building Linux routers on the x86, x86_64 architecture. I was using a rack mount server that I recently pulled out of a colo facility, a dual cpu AMD Gentoo Linux 64 bit machine, this is obviously overkill. However, I have not built any routers on embedded systems and have very little experience working with Mips based systems, having only developed for one from Netburner (which ran a proprietary os anyways). I have built quite a number of routers to operate in virtual machines.</p><p>I guess I have a couple questions.</p><p>I seem to be having trouble locating the technical information for the BCM4718, including pinouts, datasheets, any and all information related to the internal structure of the device, especially io address ranges, linux drivers, etc. Pehaps if someone has these available they could pass them this way. I checked out uClinux as well and Linux-mips, neither of which has anything significant for this device. I believe the BCM4718 is a Mips 74k device, anyone have a linux based tool chain for this system?</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>Phutzbah</p>									</div>

					<p>The most important thing for you to do is attach the serial port...</p><p>These ports use 3.3v signalling. attempting to connect to your computer&#039;s serial port will most likely fry your router. go on amazon and see if you can get a Nokia DKU-5 cable for this job. ...It&#039;s easier, and probably cheaper, than making your own serial cable. You&#039;ll also need wire strippers, a soldering iron, and some solder.</p><p>If you have this connected, you can view the boot process thru the serial interface... that way you&#039;ll know whether you softbricked it or hardbricked it, and be able to fix it. I can tell you this: with the TFTP method alone, I was NOT able to restore my E3200 from a softbrick, had to enter some commands through CFE&#039;s serial console interface. Keep that in mind.</p><p>That said, you CAN experiment with OpenWRT on your E3000, just make sure you have a way to debrick it... and a serial interface. ...that&#039;s what I&#039;m doing with my E3200.</p>									</div>
