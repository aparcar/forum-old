					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have an internet connection from the french ISP &quot;free&quot; through fiber and an ethernet converter. The ethernet has two lans tagged 835 and 836, the first for TV and the second for internet.<br />On my desktop, if I want to connect I run the following commands with success:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>vconfig add eth0 836
dhclient eth0.836</code></pre></div><p>Now I’m confused with OpenWrt Barrier breaker r40526</p><p>I just tried the same thing using udhcpc but I got no ip.</p><p>I am somewhat lost. There are tons of documentations about vlan tagging, but are they even relevant for my situation? I don’t want to build a fancy network at home.<br />In /etc/config/network, I tried:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;wan&#039;
    option ifname &#039;eth0.836&#039; # instead of ifname &#039;eth0&#039;
    option proto &#039;dhcp&#039;</code></pre></div><p>The interface eth0.836 was created, but no more luck to get an ip.</p><p>There is some discussions that the driver doesnot support more than 128 vlans, but you can set vid to anything arround 4k <a href="http://blog.philippklaus.de/2012/12/openwrt-on-a-tp-link-tl-wdr4300-router/#comment-10334">http://blog.philippklaus.de/2012/12/ope … ment-10334</a><br />Is this relevant to my case? So should I create a third vlan with vid 836 only on port 5 (the wan port: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd#switch.ports.for.vlans)">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl- … for.vlans)</a> I had little succes there either.</p><p>So: I’m not sure what is relevant relevant to my problem and I would appreciate links to a more specific documentation</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tristramg</strong> on 20 Apr 2014, 13:58)</p>

					<p>Hey there.</p><p>You skipped the most important part of your configuration: The switch.</p><p>Usually the WAN port of your switch is untagged, meaning:<br />* Incoming packages are treated as untagged.<br />* So they get tagged when joining the device.<br />* And tags get removed when packages leave the device.</p><p>Here is my vlan 2 switch configuration. <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config switch_vlan
        option device &#039;switch0&#039;
        option vlan &#039;2&#039;
        option vid &#039;2&#039;
        option ports &#039;0t 1&#039;</code></pre></div><p>This is <strong>not</strong> what you want. You have two different vlans on the outside of your switch.<br />So you need to define your port not &quot;1&quot; but &quot;1t&quot;. </p><p>This configuraiton is from my TP-Link 4900 v1, and my WAN port is numbered as &quot;1&quot; internally. Internal port &quot;0&quot; is for CPU, which needs to be &quot;0t&quot; as well in order to allow the OpenWRT linux to interact with that particular vlan. According to the wiki part &quot;Switch Ports&quot; you&#039;re right: You need to use 5 for WAN. But I don&#039;t want to adjust my working configuration fragment.</p><p>Tagged port means:<br />* The package on the outside of the switch is required to be tagged.<br />* It has to have the exact matching vlan id to join, other packages are dropped.</p><br /><p>I guess your configuraiton should look somthing like:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config switch_vlan
        option device &#039;switch0&#039;
        option vlan &#039;835&#039;
        option vid &#039;835&#039;
        option ports &#039;0t 5t&#039;

config switch_vlan
        option device &#039;switch0&#039;
        option vlan &#039;836&#039;
        option vid &#039;836&#039;
        option ports &#039;0t 5t&#039;</code></pre></div><p>That should give you virtual devices &quot;eth.835&quot; being responsible for vlan 835 and &quot;eth.836&quot; being responsible for vlan 836.<br />And since this is completely made up for you, I used the 5 here for your WAN port according to documentation.</p><p>The thing is: You need to make the switch port aware of your desired vlans. If you do your switchport wrong, it will either<br />* skip vlans and on the outside of your switch all packages appear as untagged in case you assing only &quot;5&quot; instead of &quot;5t&quot; or<br />* completely skip switching those packages if you don&#039;t assign the port 5 to that vlan at all.</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello Stephan,</p><p>Thanks a lot.<br />It worked and I appreciate the explanations.</p><p>For information for someone having troubles with the same hardware:<br />On my device (v2 of the 1043ND), there seem to be two &quot;cpu&quot; ports (0 used for the switch and 6 for the wan as suggested in the wiki)<br />So I had to use<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>option ports &#039;5t 6t&#039;</code></pre></div><p>As </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>option ports &#039;0t 5t&#039;</code></pre></div><p> would lock me out and I had to reset the configuration</p>									</div>
