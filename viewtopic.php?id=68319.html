					<p>Hi</p><p> Can anyone tell me if it is possible to upgrade the flash chip in the TP-Link WR841N/ND v9/v10 from 4Mbyte to 8Mbyte - without having to bother with custom bootloaders and so on?</p><p>If yes, what replacement chip can be used for the 2 router versions ?</p><p>Currently I have a v9 disassembled at my table - and it has a MX25L3206E 32Mbit chip. Would a simple replacement be MX25L6406x ??</p><p>Changing the chip (and copying the contents from the old to the new) is not the main issue. Knowing whether it is possible, and what replacement flash chips could be used is the desired information....</p><p>Regards</p><p>Brian</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bipsen</strong> on 30 Oct 2016, 00:26)</p>

					<p>This should be no problem. If I remember correctly, there were just problems with flash sizes above 16 MB in regular uboot (at least that it would not be able to access areas above the 16 MB position). The 1043ND V1 comes with a ST 25P64V6P, providing 8 MB. But I would expect any similar chip to work properly.</p>									</div>
