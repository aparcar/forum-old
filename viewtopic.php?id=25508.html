					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I have been crawling though various bits of the documentation and forums for OpenWRT in order to find out how to persist config file changes on the flash. The most of the documentation says that I need to use command:</p><p>nvram commit</p><p>However, this command does not exists on my OpenWRT plus also came just across a posting from October 2009 saying that nvram is no longer used. Could someone tell me how I can persist the config data on flash, so it is still there I reboot the system?</p><p>Thank you for you help. Really confused with all this contradicting documentation...</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Olli</p>									</div>

					<p>Have a look here:<br /><a href="http://kamikaze.openwrt.org/docs/openwrt.html">http://kamikaze.openwrt.org/docs/openwrt.html</a></p><p>Basically, all the configuration is now stored in different files under /etc/config. These file can be edited either directly or via the uci command or via the gui.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, I changed file /etc/config/network and after reboot the file is back to its original state <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>So you saying any file in /etc/config/ should persist automatically?
