					<p>I am working on a wifi application. Our target router is&nbsp; TPLink 1043 V1. I have run into a weird problem.</p><p>I modified the airodump-ng.c so that I could save the data to a file on the router&nbsp; ( I know that -w serves the purpose , but it prints out too&nbsp; much data, most of which I dont even need). I need to log the station mac and the power values and I save them to the file in this format</p><p>{ StationMac_1, StationPower_1},{StationMac_2,StationPower_2}, .................. </p><p>To do this I iterate over struct ST_INFO and do the&nbsp; following stuff,</p><p>unsigned char&nbsp; Temp_Station_Mac[7];&nbsp; //&nbsp; 7 character used as NULL</p><p>unsigned int&nbsp; Station_Power[2]; //Second Character used as NULL</p><p>While iterating I just&nbsp; take abs(st_cur-&gt;power) and assign it to Station_Power&nbsp; and then using multiple strcat calls I store them in a array which is written to the target file. <br />When I compile and run airodump-ng on my Laptop, I get&nbsp; Mac and Power values in the desired format in the target file but if I compile for the target system using Openwrt Toolchain , power field is null in the target file for all entries.</p><p>The file contents looks like this on the target system</p><p>{Station_Mac1, }, {Station_Mac2, },....................</p><p>I cannot understand why is the same code unable to print the value of power in the target system and what can I do to make it work.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
