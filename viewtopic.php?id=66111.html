					<p>Hello everyone.</p><br /><p>I wanted to build a minimal Barrier Breaker image, but misused the Image Generator and flashed a bad image on my router (TP-Link WR841). I can&#039;t connect to it now. It&#039;s not broadcasting any ssid. When I connect the router to my PC via ethernet:</p><ul><li><p>I see an IPv6 address under eth0 when I run ifconfig, but no IPv4 address</p></li><li><p>&#039;dhclient eth0&#039; takes almost a minute to execute and doesn&#039;t change the output of ifconfig</p></li><li><p>The router does not respond when pinged</p></li></ul><p>Though, wireshark shows that the router is responding to ARP requests.</p><br /><p>Before the build process, I only edited the files include/target.mk and repositories.conf in the Image Generator directory.</p><p>In target.mk I only removed <strong>dnsmasq</strong>, <strong>ppp</strong> and <strong>ppp-mod-pppoe</strong> from the DEFAULT_PACKAGES.router variable.</p><p>In repositories.conf, I only appended the following four lines:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>    src/gz barrier_breaker [url]http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ar71xx/generic/packages/base[/url]
    src/gz barrier_breaker [url]http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ar71xx/generic/packages/management[/url]
    src/gz barrier_breaker [url]http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ar71xx/generic/packages/packages[/url]
    src/gz barrier_breaker [url]http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ar71xx/generic/packages/routing[/url]</code></pre></div><br /><p>Then I built the image <span class="bbu">without</span> configuring the packages or files by executing:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>    make image PROFILE=TLWR841</code></pre></div><br /><p>The OpenWrt version (14.07), architecture (ar71xx), router profile and router version I selected were correct.</p><br /><p>After googling, my best guess about the mistake is that I was supposed to include the filenames in <strong>/etc/config/network/</strong> in the image generator&#039;s FILES option. If this is true, which of these files were important to include? And is there anything else I should have added in the file list? If not, where was I wrong?</p><br /><p>Also, if someone knows a way to reflash the firmware without opening the router&#039;s case, I&#039;ll be happy to hear it.</p><br /><p>Many thanks in advance to anyone who can explain.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>chishtiawais</strong> on 10 Jul 2016, 12:02)</p>

					<p>I think your problem is you have removed the dnsmasq. It is responsible for assigning IPV4 addresses to clients connected to the router. In your case no IP is assigned as it is not running. Try to set a static IP on your computer (by default the router should have 192.168.1.1 address, hence 192.168.1.10 for your computer should be OK). After you do it see whether router responds to ping, if so you should be able to ssh into it and reflash the image.</p>									</div>

					<p>You were right! Assigning an IP worked. SSH is requesting a password for some reason but telnet works just fine.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
