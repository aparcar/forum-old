					<p>OpenWrt is a meta distribution in large parts, means many packages are not shipped with source but downloaded on demand and the a local series of patches is applied to the vanilla source.</p><p>You can find the package definitions in package/ and the local patches in the patches/ subdirectory of each package folder.<br />The patched sources that got compiled can be found in build_dir/target-*/ after you run a full make run at least once.</p>									</div>
