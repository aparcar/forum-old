					<p>I was attempting to install OpenVPN, via the webif2 interface.&nbsp; While installing packages, it ran out of space, and bombed.</p><p>/jffs was reporting only 26k left.&nbsp; None of the openvpn packages are listed, when doing &#039;ipkg list_installed&#039;.&nbsp; Running the filesystem out of space screwed up ipkg.</p><p>So, I attempted to delete some other packages, that I do not need (e.g. ppp, ppoe).&nbsp; That produced a segfault. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" />&nbsp; Busybox was limping along, at this point.&nbsp; Occasionally, locking up.&nbsp; &#039;reboot&#039; from shell wouldn&#039;t work.</p><p>So I powercycled, and it came back.&nbsp; This time I tried deleting &#039;tcpdump&#039;, as it doesn&#039;t have dependencies.&nbsp; IT WORKED!&nbsp; /jffs was down to 85%.&nbsp; So, then I deleted several ppp/pppoe related packages.&nbsp; However /jjfs usage remained at 85%.</p><p>Prior to the failed openvpn install, I was ~ 60-65%.&nbsp; So, obviously the remnants of openvpn are still there, but ipkg doesn&#039;t know it, and I have no way to clean it up.</p><p>Is there a way to recover the space, and clean up the botched openvpn install?&nbsp; Without going into failsafe and blowing away /jffs?</p><p>Regards,<br />Ben</p>									</div>

					<p>Apologies for replying to an old post but I have just hit the exact same problem with the same package. I tried a similar solution as well by removing packages I wasn&#039;t using but was not able to reclaim the space.&nbsp; </p><p>The router affected was a Asus wl500g with a 2mb /jffs partition.</p><p>My solution was simple.&nbsp; I had already successfully installed openvpn on a Linksys WRT54GS so I pulled of a list of files contained in openvpn and its dependencies (kmod-tun libopenssl zlib liblzo) and deleted them from the wl500g.&nbsp; It worked and I got the space back.&nbsp; </p><p>It seems to me that ipkg is not handling the situation of installation failures particularly well.&nbsp; Should it not attempt to remove files from a package when it fails to complete an installation?&nbsp; Especially if the package is not considered as installed when &quot;ipkg list_installed&quot; is run?&nbsp; Packages must be either fully installed or not installed with no remnant files left sitting around.&nbsp; That might be acceptable on a PC with a large hard disk but with such small filesystems has exists on these routers ipkg needs to be ruthlessly efficient about cleaning up after itself.</p><p>I found the OP by searching and only after writing the above did I notice that it was posted to the WhiteRussian forum.&nbsp; Both my routers are running Kamikaze 7.09 so I may be posting in the wrong forum.&nbsp; It does however suggest that ipkg has had this problem for a while.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Gary</p>									</div>
