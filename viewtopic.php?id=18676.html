					<p>I am trying to install nodogsplash on kamikaze 8.09 RC2 2.6-brcm (wrt54gs v1.0) and I cannot get it to work.</p><p>First of all - there are some errors in init script. stop() is missing } closing bracket and in startup there&#039;s line<br />with test_module() where you need to remove $0 before it works..</p><p>---</p><p>After this - nodogsplash is running and everything seems to work fine - expect:<br />After user has authenticated, firewall still won&#039;t let user to go to internet.</p><p>Could someone please check up on this and possibly work on a update? I have contacted original author who asked me to bring the problem to here..<br />I would try to help, but I am too busy myself and I am pretty sure that someone else can do this much easier than me who would need to read awhole a lot of sources as this project isn&#039;t familiar to me from past and ofcourse I would need to study a lot about firewall tech as well..</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, but this left me exactly to the original situation. NoDogSplash seems to start and work just great - &#039;till the point.. Where user would authenticate (if you didn&#039;t enable userid/passwd auth, just click the dog on the webpage) - then browser results that server didn&#039;t reply.</p><p>If I check status I see that nodogsplash sees me as authenticated, but still I can&#039;t get to internet. I am not sure, but I think.. That my traffic is not marked as Authenticated (0x400) by firewall (and therefore allowed).. But I don&#039;t have any ideas really..</p>									</div>
