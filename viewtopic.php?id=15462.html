					<p>Hello,<br />I dream of doing such a setup:<br />wl-500gp with usb soundcard.<br />windows laptop.</p><p>I would like to play all sounds from the windows laptop on the usb soundcard connected to wl-500gp. Is that possible to do in any way? It would work as a kind of wireless soundcard. Some drivers for windows would be needed, so that windows would think that it&#039;s a normal soundcard, but all the data would be send over wi-fi.</p><p>Is anyone aware of software that could do this? It would be great :-)</p>									</div>
