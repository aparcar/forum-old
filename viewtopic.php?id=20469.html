					<p>I have a pc with only ONE ethernet port and a wrt54gl.<br />So currently I&nbsp; have this setting:</p><p> internet ------- WRT54GL))))) wireless clients<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PC</p><p>But I would like to simulate this:</p><p> internet ------ PC ------ WRT54GL&nbsp; )))))&nbsp; wireless clients</p><p>where the PC would work as a gateway and dhcp server for the wireless clients. I was thinking of doing this creating two additional vlans in the wrt54gl:<br />- one for joining the PC and the wifi part. With gateway pointing to the PC and dhcp disabled in the in the WRT54GL, so the dhcp requests are answered by the PC.<br />- the other one only for the PC, with gateway pointing to the WRT54GL and dhcp enabled in the router.</p><p>I am not sure that this will work, if you see a flaw or if there is a different/better method please let me know!</p><p>Note that I want to simulate this from the point of view of the clients. I don&#039;t mind if the systems looks different from the internet.</p><p>thanks!</p>									</div>
