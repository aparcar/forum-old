					<p>*** Quick Update</p><p>Found an interesting post on the DD-WRT Forum.&nbsp; Take a look at the post from Giraffe looking at the differences between the AC-V2 and ACS models:</p><p><a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=256298&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=1020">http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic. â€¦ start=1020</a></p><p>Seems that they are both exactly the same router but with diffferent CPU speeds.&nbsp; So I&#039;m guessing that the current issues experienced with the AC-V2 are still present with the ACS?</p><p>Thinking of just picking up a Netgear R7000 and putting Tomato on it for the time being... At least until the issues with the WRT1900AC and OpenWRT are ironed out.</p>									</div>
