					<p>Hello,</p><p>Newbie here with a scenario and a question.</p><p>We have a cinematic camera that we can control remotely via a serial connection.&nbsp; Other devices are available on the market that use a simple serial-&gt;wifi board to allow this control.&nbsp; I am attempting to use a Ubiquiti Picostation instead.&nbsp; </p><p>So far, I have figured/read/learned how to do a few things, but others elude me.&nbsp; I can disable OpenWRT&#039;s use of the serial console.&nbsp; I have also been able to wireless connect to the pico with the camera attached and visually see the serial console data.&nbsp; However, I am at a loss for what step/steps should be next.&nbsp; Ultimately, I want the camera connected to the serial port on the pico station to function similarly to how the serial to wifi bridge works.</p><p>I&#039;ve read up on netcat and ser2net and have tried both.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it&#039;s a bit beyond me (it&#039;s taken me six months of testing on my down time to get where I am).&nbsp; </p><p>Can anyone point me in the right direction or at least show me the bread crumbs?&nbsp; Ultimately, I want to take the serial data from the camera, (i believe) forward it to TCP, wirelessly access the router with my computer, and be able to send and receive data via a software control program to the camera on the other end of the router.</p><p>Thank you all for any help and insight.</p>									</div>
