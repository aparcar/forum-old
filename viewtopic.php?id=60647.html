					<p>I have followed the guest WLAN recipe here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan</a></p><p>And everything working just fine, I have a need to grant guest WLAN users access to:<br />1. local (lan) service (ip:192.168.1.10, port 5000)<br />2. PixelServ running on router at 192.168.1.11:81 (with the iptables rule which redirects requests from 192.168.3.254:80 to 192.168.1.1:81)</p><p>I&#039;ve tried to look it up and experiment with the few things and they don&#039;t seem to work. I thought that the following might do the trick:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config rule
        option name &#039;Allow LAN service Access&#039;
        option src &#039;guest&#039;
        option dest &#039;lan&#039;
        option dest_ip &#039;192.168.1.10&#039;
        option dest_port &#039;5000&#039;
        option proto &#039;all&#039;
        option target &#039;ACCEPT&#039;

config rule
        option name &#039;Allow PixelServ GIF Access&#039;
        option src &#039;guest&#039;
        option dest &#039;lan&#039;
        option dest_ip &#039;192.168.3.254&#039;
        option dest_port &#039;80-81&#039;
        option proto &#039;all&#039;
        option target &#039;ACCEPT&#039;</code></pre></div><p>However when I restart firewall I get the following error messages for both of these rules:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>   * Rule &#039;Allow LAN service Access&#039;
     ! Skipping due to different family of ip address
   * Rule &#039;Allow PixelServ GIF Access&#039;
     ! Skipping due to different family of ip address</code></pre></div><p>I would be much obliged if someone just posts the rules I need to add the the firewall config to ensure that my guest WLAN users can access both the local service at 192.168.1.10:5000 as well as see a transparent gif when hitting 192.168.3.254:80.</p><p>thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>I only have a guess (which might be wrong): Did you enable forwarding between your guest network and lan? I&#039;d assume you need that in order to grant your guests access to your lan services. But then again, I&#039;m didn&#039;t really dive deep into the OpenWrt firewall zone concept.</p><p>But be aware, this would mean you actually tamper with the separation of your private (lan) network and your guest network.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>silentcreek</strong> on 3 Nov 2015, 00:21)</p>

					<p>That&#039;s what I meant, yes. Please try to add another rule for forwarding from lan to guest as well. Because otherwise the answers of a server on lan would not be forwarded to a client on guest.</p><p>If that works, you should add firewall rules to block all traffic between the two zones except for the services that you explicitly need.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hmmm... ok. Seems there&#039;s more to it.</p><p>But what caught my attention again is your error message. Either the wording is just a bit off, or it points to a different kind of problem. The term &quot;family&quot; with regards to ip addresses is usually used for the distinction between IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. But according to your configuration it should be IPv4 only (unless you have some sort of tunneling or translation layers involved).</p>									</div>

					<p>Oh, absolutely. As I said before, I&#039;m not really an expert in the OpenWrt firewall design, so it would certainly be better if somewone with more insight can answer that.</p><p>One more note, if you still have trouble figuring it out, you could also google something like &quot;iptables forwarding between subnets&quot; and apply raw iptables rules on your OpenWrt installation and see if you can get it to work that way (even if its only for testing until you figure out the adequate parameters for uci).</p>									</div>

					<p>Oh, I feel like an idiot. I didn&#039;t want to post long cats and it played against me.

Now that I know what it&#039;s called I did google for the &quot;iptables forwarding between subnets&quot; and &quot;openwrt iptables forwarding between subnets&quot; on top of that. But all the layers and firewall vs iptables config is way over my head.
