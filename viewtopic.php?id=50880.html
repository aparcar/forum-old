					<p>Hi<br />I know this question is quite noobish, but I can&#039;t find a solution on my own<br />I own a TP-Link TL-WDR3500 with Barrier Breaker on it and another old router with integrated ADSL2+ modem.<br />I want to use my old router as a simple bridge like internet &lt;--&gt; old router (with all routing capabilities disabled) &lt;--&gt; openwrt (with NAT, firewall, etc...)<br />How can I bridge them together? I don&#039;t want NAT and firewall on each device, but if I disable NAT on my modem, I can&#039;t connect to internet with my OpenWrt device.<br />Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>What maker/model is the old router? The easiest way would be to put it into &quot;bridge mode&quot;, effectively using it as a dumb modem, and let the OpenWrt router do everything else.</p>									</div>

					<p>Since you didn&#039;t give us <em>any</em> of the information we asked for: Get a modem for a few bucks on ebay and keep the old router as a worst-case fallback. Oftentimes routers in bridge mode are too smart for their own good.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 31 May 2014, 16:24)</p>
