					<p>Hi there, </p><p>I tried to install openwrt on my Asus RT-N56U.</p><p>I followed the instructions from the wiki (asus/rt-n56u#recovery_installation) with the sysupgrade image (openwrt-15.05.1-ramips-rt3883-rt-n56u-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin), now I can&#039;t reach it via browser and only the power lamp is glowing, all other lamps are off.</p><p>Firmware restoration tool still uploads firmwares in recovery mode (tried it with the original Asus .trx) and says &quot;recovery successful&quot;, but the router still plays dead with only the power lamp glowing.</p><p>What can I do now? I&#039;m on Windows 10.</p>									</div>

					<p>Update:<br />It is a N56U B1 and no N56U, which means it is incompatible with openwrt...<br />I flashed the B1 firmware with the firmware restoration tool, now at least it works again.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>brokenasus</strong> on 4 Jan 2018, 15:30)</p>
