					<p>Sorry for the late answer. It seems as if the system forgot to subscribe me to this topic.</p><p>No first hand information here. I just wanted to be absolutely clear, so we won&#039;t break a newbie&#039;s heart in the process of continuous unfruitful self-torturing. I referenced that thread because it seemed to sum up the current status pretty compactly and anyway that was the last one I skimmed through.</p><p>I wanted to jump onto the 802.11ac bandwagon to have some inexpensive fun, but after seeing the seas of tears all over the place, I had to change my mind.</p><p>I am not following kernel development nowadays, so all my relevant information comes from quick web searches this time. If I am not mistaken, the status quo is that of all the open source drivers, only ath10k provides 802.11ac. As I&#039;ve heard, dd-wrt works around these issues by favoring binary blobs from the OEM and/or signing proprietary agreements with the vendors. Neither of which OpenWrt would like to promote as I understand. The status quo will remain until vendors release full driver source or someone would pick up the great effort of reverse engineering, like an individual seeking adventure or research group having proper financial backing.<br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open-source_wireless_drivers#Status">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compariso … ers#Status</a></p><p>Please correct me if I&#039;m misunderstanding something or if you know any fully supportable inexpensive 802.11ac devices. Note that many routers could be or have been supported up to booting and maybe in some cases even wifi works over the 802.11n cards (like in the C20), but I don&#039;t consider that real support, nor do I think that it&#039;s a good idea to purchase an AC router and use only the N radio. Of course this is a subjective matter, because some may find the extra flash, RAM or CPU power useful, and we do indeed need platform support if miracle happens and drivers start falling from the sky. However, I&#039;d rather buy 2-3x as many low power N-only routers for the same price to increase density or reach. By the way, perhaps it would be worthwhile to add columns on the kind of support provided for each device, like whether the 5GHz radio is supported.</p><p><em>edit: Okay, add Marvell to the list of good guys. Perhaps it would be useful to keep a catalog of these? Or just update the kernel wireless wiki or Wikipedia about open source wireless chipset support and cross reference that to router models via some funky SQL query. <a href="http://www.snbforums.com/threads/official-marvell-open-source-openwrt-driver.21973/">http://www.snbforums.com/threads/offici … ver.21973/</a></em></p><br /><div class="quotebox"><cite>zo0ok wrote:</cite><blockquote><div class="quotebox"><cite>bkil wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>C2 and C20i are almost the same.

I have been thinking about getting an Archer C2/C20i for the fun of playing with OpenWrt on an unsupported router, even though I might break it. But currently there is slightly too little information available on the C2/C20i to really give it a try.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>bkil wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>nor do I think that it&#039;s a good idea to purchase an AC router and use only the N radio</p></blockquote></div><p>Agree. And as long as the TL-WDR3600 is available it makes little sense to buy C2/C20i anyway, as long as AC does not work.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>bkil wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>By the way, perhaps it would be worthwhile to add columns on the kind of support provided for each device, like whether the 5GHz radio is supported.</p></blockquote></div><p>Yes! We are thinking about writing in the ToH &quot;b/g/n/(ac)&quot; when AC does not work.<br />But the challenge is to get the &quot;data&quot; in and get this information right for each router.</p><p>So, as it is, the C2/C20 remains &quot;officially completely unsupported&quot;.<br />But it is possible that they essentially work well in N-only-mode.<br />Or that not so much effort is required to get it there.</p><p>As it is, we don&#039;t really know <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

I don&#039;t know. I am pissed off with ath9k ath10k.
