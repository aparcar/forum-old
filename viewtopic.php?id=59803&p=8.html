					<p>@dibdot, I just wanted to mention that you are doing a fantastic job with regard to developing, supporting, and maintaining your Adblock script/package for OpenWrt, Dirk.&nbsp; I am very thankful.</p><p>I have a suggestion that might be interesting.&nbsp; This suggestion came to mind after you added the <em>Total count of blocked domains</em> section to Services - Adblock page in which you pull in the data count of total domains that are blacklisted.&nbsp; So my idea/suggestion that comes from that concept is also about pulling in some data to represent within the Services - Adblock page.</p><p>Quite often, I find myself often going through SCP into my OpenWrt router just to run the<em> /etc/init.d/adblock start</em> command from the terminal and going back into OpenWrt/LuCI web interface and looking in the System Log to check the number of ad/tracker packets blocked based on your Adblock for OpenWrt.</p><p>My thought is, would it be possible to add a button within the Services - Adblock page that, when pressed, would simply run the <em>/etc/init.d/adblock</em> start command and pull in the number of blocked packets from the System Log from the line <em>firewall statistics (IPv4/IPv6): 99/0 ad related packets blocked</em> and strip that down to just the actual number, in this case <em>99</em> and have that number of blocked packets show up beside the button within the Services - Adblock page.</p><p>Anyway, I think that this would be interesting and useful information to have available and with the press of a button, if possible.</p><p>Thank you for your time.&nbsp; Enjoy your weekend!</p><br /><p>EDIT:&nbsp; Added basic mockup image</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7TT86KP.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/7TT86KP.jpg" /></span></p><p>Link in case image does not load:&nbsp; <a href="http://imgur.com/7TT86KP">http://imgur.com/7TT86KP</a></p><p>In the example image, pressing the REFRESH button would essentially run the <em>/etc/init.d/adblock start</em> command and pull the stats of how many ad domains were blocked.&nbsp; Although since I am not a programmer, I do not know if this is even technically feasible.&nbsp; So just a concept idea at the moment.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>WildByDesign</strong> on 27 May 2016, 17:13)</p>

					<p>I had one other question/suggestion that I wanted to mention before I forget.&nbsp; I have always manually increased my DNSmasq <em>cachesize</em> from the default (which I believe is 256) to 1000 or 2000.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done this for several years now after playing around with OpenWrt and DNS based blacklisting/blackholing in general.</p><p>When utilizing DNS based filtering such as this Adblock script or others which can use quite large domain lists at times, would there be any benefit to increasing DNSmasq cachesize?</p><p>If there was to be some benefit of increasing DNSmasq cachesize along with this Adblock script, would it be beneficial to add the ability to change your cachesize within the Services - Adblock page, perhaps on the <em>Extra Options </em>drop down menu?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
