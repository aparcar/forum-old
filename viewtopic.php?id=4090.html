					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have just created ipkg packages for bash 3.1 and FireHOL 1.231.&nbsp; bash was ported because FireHOL requires it.&nbsp; FireHOL, for those that are not already aware, is a very powerful, but simple to use firewall configuration tool.</p><p>The bash binary is of course relatively large (~780K), but for those with access to additional storage this shouldn&#039;t be a problem.&nbsp; In addition, FireHOL need only run once, as the included init script saves the generated rules so that they can be restored with iptables-restore.&nbsp; This is highly desirable as firehol&#039;s runtime can be a couple of minutes.</p><p>Issues you may encounter:<br />1) I had to copy /etc/services from another machine of mine...otherwise iptables could not resolve some of the port names<br />2) FireHOL complains and prints some warnings unless you copy the kernel&#039;s .config file to /lib/modules/2.4.30/build/.config&nbsp; &nbsp;The warnings are harmless though.<br />3) You will probably have to manually add a file to /etc/modules.d to load the kernel modules your generated rules use.&nbsp; Modules I needed: ipt_ULOG, ipt_limit.<br />4) After you are happy with your firewall, you will want to do something like:<br />&quot;ln -s /etc/init.d/firehol /etc/init.d/S45firehol&quot;<br /> to make FireHOL start on bootup.&nbsp; You&#039;ll likely want to remove the S45firewall symlink that starts the default firewall. </p><p>I could not get FireHOL to automatically load the necessary kernel modules...although it has a feature to do that, it appears to depend on modprobe, and a simple replacement with insmod did not appear to work.</p><p>These are my first packages....please test and point out any issues.</p><p>Oh, one question:&nbsp; How can I tell the packaging system that the firehol package is for all architectures?&nbsp; I have &quot;Architecture: all&quot; in my control file, but the generated .ipk still says &quot;mipsel&quot;.</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Joel</p><p>Package source and .ipk&#039;s:<br /><a href="http://fuster.org/openwrt/">http://fuster.org/openwrt/</a></p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve updated the packages for bash and firehol.</p><p>The bash binary is now 413KB after disabling many options.</p><p>firehol now installs to an init priority after S45firewall, and by default does not run firehol if saved iptables rules are not found.&nbsp; The idea is that one would:</p><p>1) Edit firehol.conf<br />2) run &quot;firehol save&quot;<br />3) Reboot the router (or run /etc/init.d/firehol)</p><p>This way there isn&#039;t a ~3 minute delay on bootup if the rules don&#039;t already exist, and also the bash binary is not required to be available at bootup (like if it is kept on removable or networked storage).&nbsp; If the saved rules are not found, the default OpenWrt firewall is kept.</p>									</div>
