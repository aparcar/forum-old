					<p>Hi all.</p><p>I&#039;m looking for a WRT firmware to install on my WRT54GL v1.1 device. My requirements are very specific as I want to run a small office LAN with the WRT as its router.<br />The main issue is that I have a DSL line with multiple static IP addresses assigned to it and the original WRT54G firmware doesn&#039;t know nothing about such things.</p><p>I need:<br />* Ability to redirect different incoming IP addresses to different internal servers (DNAT)<br />* GUI for all the important features.<br />* Dialup using PPPoE<br />* Wireless LAN, of course</p><p>I would like:<br />* Ability to set VLANs for DMZ and stuff<br />* ssh access to the router from the WAN, with easy CLI</p><p>Does OpenWRT offers all these features ? And if not - can you recommend another firmware for WRT that would offer these ? </p><p>Thanks in advance</p>									</div>

					<p>if OpenWRT doesn&#039;t suit you, check out DD-wrt (.com)<br />they&#039;re heavy on the web GUI, might be what you&#039;re looking for.. though I&#039;m not 100% on the features.</p>									</div>

					<p>GUI support is important because while I&#039;m an experienced linux user, I have never player with embedded devices distros, and I currently do not have the time for a steep learning curve - I need something up and running this week.</p><p>If the important features I need (DNAT, PPPoE, Wireless) are supported in the GUI, and if the missing GUI elements will be added eventually, then I&#039;ll be happy to go with OpenWRT.</p>									</div>

					<p>The UI is developed by the x-wrt group, which is quickly catching up on web ui support for kamikaze.</p><p>As for the learning curve. There is none.

					<p>WhiteRussian is not more in development since last february.&nbsp; Current version is Kamikaze, and the first stable version has been released last June 2nd (<a href="http://kamikaze.openwrt.org">http://kamikaze.openwrt.org</a>).. <br />On X-Wrt project site (<a href="http://x-wrt.org">http://x-wrt.org</a>) there is an already compiled firmware image for your router, with the web interface (Webif^2). See <a href="http://downloads.x-wrt.org/xwrt/kamikaze/7.06/brcm-2.4/">http://downloads.x-wrt.org/xwrt/kamikaze/7.06/brcm-2.4/</a> . Webif is not still an official release, and at the moment lacks of a few functions...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ggp81</strong> on 5 Jun 2007, 14:32)</p>

					<p>there may be ipkg files available for x-wrt and kamikaze, or you can checkout the SVN and compile it on your linux box using the Kamikaze SDK. White Russian is capable of doing everything you need, but it&#039;s soon to be not supported after kamikaze matures a little further.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you want to do DNAT with multiple external static IP to certain internal IP, you would do best to just use the command-line.&nbsp; If you already know some iptables this should not be difficult.&nbsp; On WhiteRussian you would edit /etc/firewall.user to add to the existing firewall.&nbsp; Not sure what you use yet on Kamikaze, just starting on it now.</p>									</div>
