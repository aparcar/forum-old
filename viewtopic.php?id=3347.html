					<p>I&#039;m looking for some opinions on which to buy.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read some about all and I have a WRT54G, but I am looking for other opinions.&nbsp; I want to setup a web server with PHP and FTP access.&nbsp; I will be using it to receive pictures from my cell phone via MMS and display the pictures on a website.&nbsp; If I have equal &quot;hard drive&quot; space between all of them which would be best?&nbsp; Are there any new WL models coming out that would be better?&nbsp; Also is there any real difference between the two WL models in terms of functionality.&nbsp; The only difference I can find is the one is designed for USB the other for IDE.&nbsp; Thanks for the advice.</p>									</div>
