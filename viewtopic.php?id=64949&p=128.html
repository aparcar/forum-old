If your first one is on 127.0.0.1#5353 (the default), put the second one on 127.0.0.1#5454.&nbsp; But be sure the entry for /pool.ntp.org/208.67.222.222 is below both of them in the /etc/config/dhcp (dnsmasq config) file.</p><p>Just a heads up though: If you enable a second resolver, sometimes it will use the first and sometimes it will use the second.&nbsp; It won&#039;t only use the second if the first is down.&nbsp; No way to make it always use the first; if both are up and working, it will sometimes use the first and other times use the second.&nbsp; But if both resolvers are good, high quality, and support the features you want (such as no-logging and DNSSEC) it doesn&#039;t really matter.</p><p>I use and recommend soltysiak and dnscrypt.nl-ns0 since they both FULLY support both DNSSEC and IPv6, along with no-logging, and are not located in the US. (soltysiak will most likely one day be renamed to dnscrypt.pl -- pl for poland, nl for netherlands; they are both operated by the same group of people).&nbsp; They also both have websites for support and last time I checked, each had an uptime of over 99.9%</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>starcms</strong> on 25 Aug 2017, 20:12)</p>

Any guidance or article explaining how to use these options with this would be very helpful.&nbsp; Thank you!</p>									</div>

					<p><strong>@those using dnscrypt</strong></p><p>If you are using more than one resolver (which I also highly recommend), I highly recommend adding the line:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>option allservers &#039;1&#039;</code></pre></div><p>to the config dnsmasq section of /etc/config/dhcp.</p><p>This will ensure that if one of your resolvers goes down, your second will be used transparently and there will be no DNS issues/outages noticed by the user.</p><p>Dnsmasq is supposed to do that on it&#039;s own (use another available resolver/DNS server if the first is not working) but it doesn&#039;t always work properly, and you could be stuck with no DNS if your first resolver goes out even though you have a second as a backup.&nbsp; Adding that option forces dnsmasq to always try all resolvers and use the first one that responds and fixes the issue of it sometimes not using the second resolver if the first goes down.&nbsp; It also has the added benefit of using the fastest resolver you have configured.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>starcms</strong> on 27 Aug 2017, 00:58)</p>
