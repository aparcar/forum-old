Other changesets can be displayed normally.</p><p>Since an email to webmaster@openwrt.org is rejected (User unknown in virtual mailbox table), I will post this error to the forum. <br />Or is it better to create a ticket for this?

					<p>Too many connections? This should affect other changesets as well, doesn&#039;t it? But I get the error only with that particular changeset, and I tried multiple times since yesterday.<br />But anyway, I hope your new server will be ready soon :-)<br />On monday, I had a big shock with my server, after upgrading RAM and reconnecting the power, the power supply blew up with loud sparks and smoke :-O<br />I&#039;m glad, it did not affect any other components, after swapping the power supply, everything was ok.</p>									</div>

					<p>As this is a huge changeset, I think it is more a problem with the page generation taking longer than the allowed timeout, so it never finishes and always produces an error.<br />The new server should fix that too (until the load is again too high enough).</p>									</div>
