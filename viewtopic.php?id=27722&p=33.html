					<p>Hello Dickie, don&#039;t agree with you. I&#039;ve done some testing with arokh&#039;s build r25727 but both dd-wrt and the stock firmware v1.0.7.98 do give me far better wireless connections. See also my earlier post (2011-02-28 22:04:29) on which I haven&#039;t seen any reaction.. <br />For now I&#039;m using dd-wrt for a couple of days without any wireless problems. My WiFi internet radio is already playing &gt;24 hours without a single interruption (and with a steady 2 bars!).</p><p>Regards..Dick</p>									</div>

					<p>good call - thats exactly the issue I saw with the latest build (odd that it wasn&#039;t appearing in some of the older ones I was using).&nbsp; &nbsp;Its definitely something thats appeared recently -&nbsp; r25097 never had these issues.&nbsp; At least I&#039;m not going mad.&nbsp; &nbsp;I might have to struggle with stock until this ticket is resolved.&nbsp; Thanks for pointing me straight at it! :-)</p>									</div>
