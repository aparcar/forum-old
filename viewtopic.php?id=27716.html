					<p>It is confusing to new users that this forum only mentions the ancient &quot;Whiterussian&quot; as the stable version and also the subforum &quot;Developers only&quot; is classified to belong to the Whiterussian heading...</p><p>Shouldn&#039;t there be specific forums for newer versions, Kamikaze and Backfire? </p><p>Maybe there should be a new class &quot;Stable versions&quot;, under which there would be forums &quot;Whiterussian&quot;, &quot;Kamikaze&quot; and &quot;Backfire&quot;.</p><p>The &quot;Developers only&quot; forum should be moved away from WhiteRussian, as it mostly concerns other versions. &quot;Developers only&quot; could be moved to be in class &quot;General&quot; next to &quot;General discussion&quot;. And the division between &quot;General&quot; and &quot;Community&quot; is not that clear. Maybe they should be combined?</p>									</div>

					<p>Agreed.&nbsp; &quot;WhiteRussian&quot; should either be labeled as &quot;legacy&quot; or archived and &quot;Developers Only&quot; should be moved.&nbsp; Some re-organization could be done either by release/version or by platform, etc... either way would be an improvement.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>LinkZ</strong> on 13 Dec 2010, 18:09)</p>

					<p>I`am reged about 3 Years. <br />And everytime i search in the Forum, i think why is not a german speach subforum in the current openwrt relase rubrik?<br />Shure the language of the firmware is English and ereyone of the useres must understand that. But why everyone must use google-tranlate or whatever when he will write a question???<br />And why is the board not sortet in the versions generell?<br />I understand was is written in the board in english. yes.... I can read better english as i can writte :-)<br />But why i must read all in english. Openwrt i used overall in the world. <br />Last week i download a Podcast over Itunes make fom Choas Computer Club Germany over the Theme Openwrt.<br />See the Board Struktur of DD-wrt. There is sorted by Platform and Language.<br />1 Monts ago a Friend tell me that he would flash his device with linux. <br />Openwrt was interesssing but he flashes dd-wrt because the have a german subforum.</p><p>Short i think this Struktur was interessing and useable:</p><p># Backfire<br />- English<br /> - Ar7xx<br />&nbsp; - Broadcom<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; .....<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- General Discussion</p><p>- German<br /> - Ar7xx<br />&nbsp; - Broadcom<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; .....<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- General Discussion</p><p>- Russian<br /> - Ar7xx<br />&nbsp; - Broadcom<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; .....<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- General Discussion</p><p>- Howtos and Documentation<br />- Developers Only</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------</p><br /><p># WhiteRussian<br />- English<br /> - Ar7xx<br />&nbsp; - Broadcom<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; .....<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- General Discussion</p><p>- German<br /> - Ar7xx<br />&nbsp; - Broadcom<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; .....<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - General Discussion</p><p>- Russian<br /> - Ar7xx<br />&nbsp; - Broadcom<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; .....<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- General Discussion</p><p>- Howtos and Documentation<br />- Developers Only</p><br /><p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p><br /><p># Kamikaze<br />- English<br /> - Ar7xx<br />&nbsp; - Broadcom<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; .....<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - General Discussion</p><p>- German<br /> - Ar7xx<br />&nbsp; - Broadcom<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; .....<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - General Discussion</p><p>- Russian<br /> - Ar7xx<br />&nbsp; - Broadcom<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; .....<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - General Discussion</p><p>- Howtos and Documentation<br />- Developers Only</p><br /><br /><p>###<br />best regards<br />Der Micha</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>DerMicha</strong> on 13 Dec 2010, 19:00)</p>

					<p>l10n, l18n, mean support for 10, 18 most common languages respectively.<br />Platforms are more than 2, <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/wiki/platforms">count it yourself</a>.<br />Now multiply Languages x Platforms x Branches = 2214 Forum headers.</p><p>So think again: While you are searching for a for a problem already solved in Chinese/Klingon. How do you found it? How do you even search for it? Do you really read and write in 18 languages? Do you ever translate a Wiki page to your language?</p><p>This forum as most forums is &quot;search engine driven&quot;, you must &quot;search before post&quot;, but that is not enforced by moderators and most newbies repost... In every forum header they found.</p><p>Keep using Google translate, it does not work in other way.</p>									</div>

					<p>**** you must &quot;search before post&quot;, ....and most newbies repost... ****</p><p>Yeap i know. Why you shout see only 3 Posts about me, when i since in for about 3 Years. :-)<br />I use the search function in this forum, google and translate last time often the &quot;eco&quot; site where is in polinisch.</p><p>And yes i know that openwrt support many many platfoms. <br />But leave the language subtabs ago.... my schoolenglish an google will work for years.<br />But Differnt Branches &amp; Different Platforms bring`s special questions too eg. switchdriver or wifidriver.<br />So i think the struktur the i postet above brings clearnes in the board.</p><p>It`s only a Suggestion from me to support the project.</p><p>Now i go to clear the street from snow, and other user with more posts can vote for the right way. </p><p>mfg</p>									</div>

					<p>I have had a similar experience when I first started using OpenWRT but with time and patience I found the current arrangement productive.<br />There are tools such as Google Translate and others that allow me to get the gist of the code or implementation from others.</p><p>The danger I see in different languages is fragmentation.<br />Each group will stay in their own forum. This will reduce the amount of exposure to others and ideas.<br />It could reduce the richness and breadth that I currently see in these forums and perhaps the very strength of&nbsp; OpenWRT/opensource.</p><p>On a constructive side perhaps a tool for translation or something similar or a better search tool.</p><p>~john</p>									</div>
