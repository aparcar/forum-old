					<p>I performed a new svn to get a current version of trunk.&nbsp; It compiles without a problem for the AR7xxx target, with a profile of Gl.iNet, but when I load a new config file, for a ralink device, it still compiles for the AR7xxx.&nbsp; When I go back into menuconfig, it again shows the AR7xxx target, not the RT288x target which shows after I load the relink config file.&nbsp; I have been careful to say &quot;Yes&quot; to save the new configuration when I exit.</p><p>This also happens if I load a config file for a wl-520gu--everything looks fine, but when I exit and re-enter, it still shows the AR7xxx target.</p><p>How can I fix or work around this?</p>									</div>

					<p>With another new checkout of trunk, I get the same problem--a configuration file loaded with apparent success is not saved, even though I click save upon exiting &quot;make menuconfig&quot;.</p><p>What problem(s) with my installation might be causing this, and how would I fix it?</p><p>(Note--120G available on the hard drive.&nbsp; Ubuntu circa 2012.&nbsp; Have done this successfully many times before.)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lizby</strong> on 15 Sep 2014, 19:11)</p>

					<p>The only solution I have found to this problem is to copy my saved configuration file to the &quot;.config&quot; file, for instance, &quot;cp ralink3.config .config&quot;.&nbsp; Then &quot;make menuconfig&quot; shows those settings, and &quot;make&quot; works to produce the correct binaries.</p><p>Simply saving on exit after making changes does not save the &quot;.config&quot; file with my setup.</p>									</div>
