					<p>Hi,</p><p>Are the any plans to create Tags in the SVN repository for the Barrier Breaker RCs and the final release&gt;</p><p>The Wiki page at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/about/latest">http://wiki.openwrt.org/about/latest</a> says that the final release of Barrier Breaker should be SVN ID r42625, but the Barrier Breaker area of the SVN repository seems to have moved on from there to r42887.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure what this means in terms of &quot;final release&quot;, but it would be useful anyway to have tags in the &quot;tags&quot; area for the various Barrier Breaker releases, the same as seems to have been done for the older releases.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Michael</p>									</div>
