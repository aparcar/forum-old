					<p>tww1fa, what did you find?&nbsp; I never really found anything I considered to be concrete on the matter, but I definitely had no luck with 10.03.1 on the A2 A0 hardware revision.&nbsp; I believe it was that same line in the rc6 release notes that prompted me to try it, but it wouldn&#039;t boot.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, </p><p>So I am another newbiw looking to get Open-wrt running on my buffalo router, I&#039;m just about ready to throw it at the wall. My current set up is:</p><p>Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH(B) B0 C0<br/>Kernel Version 3.3.8<br/>OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment r32130 / LuCI Trunk (trunk+svn8702)</p><p>I installed the firmware and successfully set up the pppoe connection and can connect to the internet. I then installed LuCI and can access the router configuration through a web browser.</p><p>Ive set up wireless and can connect to the router via wireless.</p><p>The problems I am having are to do with browsing the internet and connecting to my work SSL VPN. Some sites will work most of the time, such as google.com, and then some sites won&#039;t load at all, and I cannot get my work SSL VPN page to load. The best connections seem to be immediately after the router has been rebooted and the connections slowly deteriorate after that. For example, I can connect to facebook and facebook chat will load, after a few minutes facebook chat will disconnect. As well, i can connect to <a href="https://mail.google.com/">https://mail.google.com</a> and browse my email, but google chat will not connect. Throughout all this, Skype will stay connected fine (its the first thing to connect).</p><p>I am assuming there might be something that i need to configure with IPTables, but I havent been able to find what that might be, and as I&#039;m experiencing intermittent problems (not a consistent blocking of ssl for example) I am not sure what configuration might need to be changed.</p><p>I have searched the forums a little bit, and there are certainly some versions of firmware that are recommended by some people, but others still have trouble, so im not sure if changing my firmware is the answer or not. I&#039;m hoping that there are a few simple configuration steps that I have overlooked!</p><p>An example from my iptables log when trying to connect to the SSL VPN:</p><p>Jun 21 18:36:23 OpenWrt kern.warn kernel: [&nbsp; 585.130000] MSSFIX(wan):IN=br-lan OUT=pppoe-wan MAC=XX:XX:XX:3f:f9:d1:08:11:96:3e:c8:2c:XX:XX SRC=192.168.1.176 DST=x.x.x.x LEN=48 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=127 ID=19534 DF PROTO=TCP SPT=49868 DPT=443 WINDOW=8192 RES=0x00</p><p>And randomly in the logs i see the below, which from searches I have done was fixed in patches, but I&#039;m still seeing it in the logs and not sure what that means.</p><p>OpenWrt kern.err kernel: [&nbsp; 199.840000] ath: phy0: Failed to stop TX DMA, queues=0x004!</p><p>Any hints on how to get this router stable will be much appreciated!!</p>									</div>

					<p>I _believe_ but am no expert--<br/>On your MSSFIX it appears that your computer (IN=br-lan)&nbsp; is trying to send a packet larger than the MTU of the router out (OUT=pppoe-wan) to the WAN/internet.<br/><a href="http://www.firebrick.co.uk/fb6000/tcpmssfix.php">http://www.firebrick.co.uk/fb6000/tcpmssfix.php</a></p><p>Not sure if this is hurting your transmission, as the page above says &quot;The tcp-mss-fix option spots the TCP connection packets (SYN), finds the TCP MSS option, checked the value, and if too big it adjusts it. This way the negotiated MSS for the TCP link is lower and the end points send smaller packets to each other, so avoiding any errors or fragments.&quot;&nbsp; -- which woudl imply it automatically limits itself.</p><p>Perhaps as a troubleshooting step you could turn down the MTU on your computer?&nbsp; (i don&#039;t _know_ thats the right thing to do but it _seems_ to me like it would be)</p><p>just an idea to start with..</p>									</div>

					<p>I just bought a Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH2. I wasn&#039;t able to do a tftp install, probably because of the locked U-boot mentioned in this forum and elsewhere, but I was able to do an mtd system upgrade from within an ssh session on the DD-WRT profesional firmware the router came with. (which I could tftp install just fine). As an important note, after the mtd flash and when the router came up, the red diag light never went off, but I was able to telnet in anyway. Once Luci was up I was able to turn off the red diag light, so it might be that the trunk version I installed just had the light on by default. (I installed OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment r32793)</p><p>Here are a couple of strange aspects that seem to differentiate the version I have.</p><p>root@host:/etc/config# cat /proc/mtd<br/>dev:&nbsp; &nbsp; size&nbsp; &nbsp;erasesize&nbsp; name<br/>mtd0: 01000000 00010000 &quot;spi0.0&quot;<br/>mtd1: 01000000 00010000 &quot;spi0.1&quot;<br/>mtd2: 00040000 00010000 &quot;u-boot&quot;<br/>mtd3: 00010000 00010000 &quot;u-boot-env&quot;<br/>mtd4: 00010000 00010000 &quot;art&quot;<br/>mtd5: 00100000 00010000 &quot;kernel&quot;<br/>mtd6: 01e90000 00010000 &quot;rootfs&quot;<br/>mtd7: 01d10000 00010000 &quot;rootfs_data&quot;<br/>mtd8: 00010000 00010000 &quot;user_property&quot;<br/>mtd9: 01f90000 00010000 &quot;firmware&quot;</p><p>I got fw_printenv working, but only after fiddling with the numbers used to recreate the configuration file.<br/>root@host:/etc/config# cat /etc/fw_env.config<br/>#MTD device name&nbsp; &nbsp; Device offset&nbsp; &nbsp; Env. size&nbsp; &nbsp; Flash sector size<br/>/dev/mtd3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0x20500000&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0x10000&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0x10000</p><p>I&#039;m still getting it all set up, so I haven&#039;t turned on wifi yet. It is replacing an existing WRT54GL that had openwrt on it, but I need to plan for a time to convert so I can handle the inevitable problems.</p>									</div>

I tried hard to love dd-wrt (I have it running on a &quot;bridged&quot; router) but I gave up.

					<p>For me, flashing using the web-interface has been more stable (100% success) as flashing over<br/>ssh. So maybe that&#039;s an option for you as well ?</p><p>Luckily tftp works for me, so even when the flashing goes wrong, I can easily recover.</p>									</div>

					<p>Question (and I am clearly grasping at straws here): do you change network segment before flashing? I changed&nbsp; default 192.168.11.0 to 192.168.1.0. Obviously, the new image (openwrt) has 192.168.1 as well - so it shouldn&#039;t matter... But who knows!</p>									</div>
