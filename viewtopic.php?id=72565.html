					<p>well yes, i don&#039;t mean traffic goes to the vpn from the router, just that everything from the vpn client goes through the router.</p><p>so, the remote pc once on vpn all traffic goes to the vpn server even though it has an internet connection local, the vpn client pc will send internet traffic through the vpn as well as traffic destined for networks hosted on the vpn router.</p><p>You can also modify the push to only push the routes you want going to the vpn.</p>									</div>
