					<p>Hi;</p><p>I&#039;ve installed OpenWRT on a Raspberry Pi 3 and I am trying to setup the build environment on that (Not cross-compiling). Apparently, some of the required packages like `build-essential` don&#039;t exist on opkg. Any idea?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p><p>Vahid</p>									</div>

					<p>build-essential is a meta package anyway with the following depends on Ubuntu 16.04 (which I use): ibc6-dev | libc-dev, gcc (&gt;= 4:5.2), g++ (&gt;= 4:5.2), make, dpkg-dev (&gt;<br />= 1.17.11).</p><p>Try the following two packages in openwrt: gcc, make</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenWrt isn&#039;t really made for that, if you do want to do actual development and native compiling, you&#039;d be better suited with a general purpose desktop distribution (e.g., in alphabetical order, arch, debian, fedora, gentoo, OpenSuSE, ubuntu).

					<p>@mikma,</p><p>Thanks a lot for your response. I have already installed `gcc` and `make` on the OpenWRT. I didn&#039;t expect them to be sufficient to build complex codes on OpenWRT. I&#039;ll give it a try.</p><p>@slh,</p><p>Many thanks for your reply. You&#039;re right. I know cross-compiling is a better choice. I want to compile WebRTC for OpenWRT and then build another application which uses WebRTC libraries. I&#039;ve already done that for ARM, but not for OpenWRT. Do you know any straightforward cross-compiling instructions?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p><p>Bests,<br />Vahid</p>									</div>
