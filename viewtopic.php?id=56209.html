					<p>Hello!, I&#039;m new to this community so please bear with me <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />. I have a Netgear WNDR4300 router (N750 dual band) FCC ID: PY312100187. Currently using DD-WRT, my motivation to switch to OpenWRT is because I like the baazar philosophy, and because on a later stage I&#039;m planning&nbsp; to do some crazy things like multiwan with a wifi usb stick, and things like that <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />. I believe openWRT is the way to go for this magic.</p><p>Here are my questions: </p><p>1. In the wiki (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr4300">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr4300</a>) there seems to be 2 versions of this router. Mine doesn&#039;t have any &quot;version&quot; number on the model, but seems to be similar to the V2 of the wiki (cause RAM and FLASH size). Is this correct?.</p><p>2. I&#039;ve found several references to this model as &quot;WNDRNAND&quot;. I assume this is because of the nand flash chip it comes with, so this name is actually WNDR4300 equivalent. Is this correct?</p><p>3. I would like to flash Arokh&#039;s build (<a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=50914">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=50914</a>). I would like to know from somebody that is using this build on this model is there are issues. I&#039;ve seen many &quot;I bricked my router&quot; post with this model. Any major concern? any special process I need to perform before flashing?. Coming from DD-WRT I&#039;m aware of factory reset 30/30/30, etc. Is any of this method recommended during DD-WRT to OpenWRT flashing?.<br />Main use will be home ADSL routing, wifi AP + LAN , and external USB HDD sharing (samba). Might use VPN in the future (roadwarrior!!). Might use DNLA if everything holds (specially CPU)</p><p>4.I&#039;m currently using DD-WRT, so I would like to know if the process to flash openWRT is: <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; a. going from DD-WRT to netgear factory firmware <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; b. from netgear FW flashing openWRT img<br />or I can go from DD-WRT to openWRT directly?</p><br /><p>Thanks to anyone who can enlighten my with knowledge!.</p>									</div>

					<p>Netgear does not label v1&#039;s as such, only v2 and up get that label. You can check the FCCID based on my response in the other thread.</p><p>Go back to stock before flashing openwrt.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drawz</strong> on 12 Mar 2015, 03:54)</p>
