					<p>Hello everybody,<br />this is my first post on the forum. I&#039;ve recently bought a Buffalo WZR-600DHP router which I am using with the last OpenWrt release (Chaos Calmer). Everything is awesome, a part the fact that I&#039;m experiencing troubles with p910nd (the print server).</p><p>Here is the thing:</p><p>-My printer is a Canon PIXMA MP230</p><p>-I&#039;m using Debian testing</p><p>-The printer is fully supported by Linux and is perfectly working when is directly plugged into one of my computers.</p><p>-Openwrt identify the printer</p><p>Dmesg output:</p><p>&quot;usb 1-1: new high-speed USB device number 3 using ehci-platform<br />usblp 1-1:1.1: usblp0: USB Bidirectional printer dev 3 if 1 alt 0 proto 2 vid 0x04A9 pid 0x175F&quot;</p><p>and mount it in /dev/usb/lp0 (shouldn&#039;t it be /dev/lp0 on recent kernels?).</p><p>-The usb modules installed are: kmod-usb-core, kmod-usb-printer, kmod-usb2, libusb-1.0, usbutils. </p><p>-I followed the tutorial on the wiki (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/p910nd.server">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/p910nd.server</a>). <br />This is my conf (plus bind option)</p><p>-Port 9100 is opened on the firewall and p910nd daemon is running:<br />netstat -tunpl<br />tcp&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 192.168.1.1:9100&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0.0.0.0:*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LISTEN&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1269/p9100d</p><p>- Printer is set up in Debian with System-config-printer. No problem. I&#039;ve tried to set it with the CUPS web interface and,again, no problem again.</p><br /><p>Here we go! Ready to print! And indeed, the printing process starts... but... is bloody slow: it takes at least five minutes to print one single page (BN or colour it makes no difference).<br />However logread does not detect any anomaly (or does it and I&#039;m not realizing?). <br />Here is the output:</p><p>&quot;lpr.notice p9100d[1269]: Connection from 192.168.1.XXX port 46408 accepted&quot;<br />&quot;lpr.notice p9100d[1269]: Finished job: 1645586/1645586 bytes sent to printer, 668025/668025 bytes sent to network&quot;</p><p>Strange enough, when the print process is terminated the printer remains in this state for some time:<br />&quot;Waiting for printer to finish&quot;.</p><p>- Finally, if I try to stop a printing job the printer does it immediately: it seems there is no communication problem between my devices and Openwrt/p910nd.</p><p>I&#039;ve browsed a lot but I&#039;ve found no solution. Any clue?<br />Thanks in advance.</p><p>notlikeyou</p><p>P.s: unfortunately I can&#039;t tests on any Windows clients.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>notlikeyou</strong> on 24 Sep 2015, 21:38)</p>

					<p>You are right that there is no connection problem b/w your devices. The problem is in drivers. Go to official Canon Printer website. Check there that any update for your model drivers are available or not. If available, then uninstall that old and install these new and updated drivers. Hope this might fix your issue...If not? then check Canon Pixma Mp230 Manual - guideusermanual.com/product-name-pixma-mp230-manual&amp;po=157087&amp;lang=English for more help and support.</p>									</div>
