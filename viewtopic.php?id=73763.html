					<p>Hello everyone!</p><p>My first time here on the forums. I am also quite new to using OpenWRT (was primarily using DD-WRT earlier but wanted to give OpenWRT a shot on some other routers). </p><p>So I have this old Netgear WN2000RPT (v1) and did a bit of research and found that it is very similar to the Netgear WNR2000v0 router. I am trying to find a suitable latest OpenWRT firmware that I can flash it with since the Netgear stock firmware hasn&#039;t been updated in years. Hoping to have the repeater live a bit longer instead of junking it. </p><p>Based on the wiki, it appears the stock firmware is based on OpenWRT Kamikaze firmware 7.09. </p><p>Reference: OpenWRT Wiki - Netgear WNR2000</p><p>If you scroll down to Supported Versions, it says for WNR2000v0, you should use... &quot;trunk (use AP81 profile)&quot; software but I&#039;m not sure where to exactly find this in the downloads.</p><p>Not sure if it is okay to use the AR71xx target (wnr2000-squashfs-factory-NA.img) from 17.01.4/targets/ar71xx/generic/ ?</p><p>or maybe that is only meant for WNR2000v1/2 and not WNR2000v0? </p><p>Hopefully someone can chime in on this. Thanks.</p>									</div>
