					<p>I&#039;ve had my Openwrt router for about 8 years now and it finally gave out. It was a real work horse and reliable (a la Fonera router). It came with Openwrt preinstalled so I knew it was Openwrt compatible. I have, from time to time, looked at getting a second router as a backup, but ever time I go out and spend money on a new router that I believe to be Openwrt compatible, it turns out to be wrong. Over the last 8 years I have acquired a mountain of routers which have all turned out to be wrong/incompatible.&nbsp; I love the idea of having a router as versatile as openwrt, but until there is a better way to get one that works, I&#039;m going to have to give up on it. You should consider starting an associated website for reselling routers to go with this software, so people only have to buy 1 router (for the life of the router) to get what it is that they actually want. I would be willing to spend a little bit more on a router knowing that it is actually the correct model/version then one I might get from bestbuy or newegg, because right now i&#039;ve wasted $xxx&#039;s and have nothing to show for it (except a ton of routers with stock firmware/vulnerabilities/backdoors/default ssh keys/etc).</p>									</div>

					<p>The last router I bought was TP-Link TL-WR720N which is listed on the openwrt site as a valid router. When I got it home, it was not valid. There was a very little note on the site: Note: TP-Link also markets a very different router under the same name. <br />But no where does it say that &quot;very different router&quot; == &quot;incompatible with openwrt&quot;, or how to differentiate between the 2 routers. Theres no picture of the &quot;good&quot; router. The model numbers are the same. <br />I looked at your website &quot;<a href="http://www.gargoyle-router.com">www.gargoyle-router.com</a>&quot; and it looks good. But are those routers openwrt compatible? I&#039;m a little burnt out on buying routers at the moment, but when I get some extra cash again, and do a little bit more research, I might just look into getting one from your site. The Gargoyle Pocket Router (v2) looks very cool for the price.<br />Thank you guys for your posts.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve been running OpenWRT on my routers for about a decade, I never had any problems getting the correct router. Of course I checked compatibility in the wiki and forums every time. I don&#039;t think you can blame your router mess on anybody other than yourself for buying random routers and praying they work.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not trying to be obstinate, but I did research what I was buying, and I still ended up with undesirable results. I realize that openwrt has no ability to control how the manufactures label their routers. I also realize that merchants don&#039;t always list or even sometimes know what version number the product is inside of it&#039;s packaging.&nbsp; But I would suggest maybe starting an online store where routers could be bought that are guaranteed to be compatible or maybe even with the software already installed. Or maybe even a simpler solution might be to start a list of url&#039;s where people have bought routers that are known to be compatible (although with this the router company might change it without notice).</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey there.</p><p>Are you sure you picked devices that are compatible according to the wiki pages and have available build targets on downloads.openwrt.org?</p><p>I did run four Linksys WRT54GL, two Netgear WNR3500, two TP-Link 1034, one TP-Link 4300 and three TP-Link 4900. If I was on to buying another device, I would go for TP-Link Archer C5 or C7. All of them have lots of documentation on the wiki, all of them have available build targets (linked by the according wiki pages) and for all of them there is some discussion going on here.</p><p>I never bought a device for running OpenWRT that turned out to be incompabile.</p><p>But I aggree with the requirement of making it more obvious which device is compatible which isn&#039;t. It often turns out to be pretty time consuming for investigating for the actual support state of a particular device and being really sure about that. At least if it isn&#039;t one of the devices being hyped currently.</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>									</div>

					<p>I had an idea that might work a bit better, add a member rating system to the list of hardware, people can vote on routers they would be more likely to purchase or like better, and add a way to sort the list by that. I know as the list gets older, the dynamics should probably change in some way, maybe a time-weighted voting system of sorts. Just an idea.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey there.</p><p>I don&#039;t think having things like &quot;59% have no problems with device xyz, 12% can&#039;t use 5GHz, 29% had no luck at all&quot; as a memers rating summary is usefull for anybody.</p><p>Instead, having a single table of hardware that allows to compare different devices against each other in terms of specific features without that &quot;percentage of: works well&quot; is the way to go.

Just look at the current TP-Link hype devices, C5 and C7. At the moment, I wouldn&#039;t go for anything else. The C5 is awesom in terms of price/performance ratio. But just as former products, I think in a couple of month from now they are not sold any longer but have reacht their end of life. Then there will be other products to recommend and a recommendation made today is useless. </p><p>And that&#039;s what&#039;s going to happen if a huge number of different devices is recommended by a relatively small number of individuals each.</p><p>Instead, one must somehow &quot;downrate&quot; a specific member vote depending on its age and make more recent votes count more than older ones. And out of a sudden, you&#039;re guessing &quot;magic numbers&quot; in a statistical problem.</p><p>There&#039;s a good chance that costs days and days of implementation and adjustment and in the end causes more problems and confusion than if there was no such a thing at all.</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>									</div>

There are a couple ways to think about this:</p><p>- There&#039;s a team of people working to fix the Table of Hardware (ToH) to make it easy to find routers that are supported by the latest builds. This means that people can winnow down the set of routers simply by looking at the ToH. (In fact, we may produce a separate &quot;Supported by BB/14.07&quot; ToH, and a &quot;Supported by CC&quot; ToH, etc.) See <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=56521&amp;p=24">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 1&amp;p=24</a></p><p>- (Most) people only buy a router every 5-10 years. In the absence of other information, they will simply to go to Amazon or Best Buy and buy some cheap/crappy router off the shelf. At least these new ToH&#039;s will help them purchase a decent router that&#039;ll run OpenWrt and will likely work really well. </p><p>- I&#039;ve been trying to imagine a way that this forum could provide useful information that doesn&#039;t go stale. Maybe a &quot;Router Recommendations - July 2015&quot; topic that gets superceded by &quot;Router Recommendations - August 2015&quot;, etc...? Maybe there&#039;s some kind of poll that we could put on the Wiki...</p>									</div>
