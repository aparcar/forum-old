					<p>I am happy that you finally accepted a roofnet package, and performed some of the needed fixes when they were reported. But there&#039;s a lot more bugs, and fixups of various types needed to make Roofnet run correctly with OpenWRT. Some of these changes are within the roofnet package itself, others are changes to other parts of the system. I have made many of these myself, for use here in Cambridge on the city&#039;s municipal mesh network. I&#039;d like to submit many of the changes needed back to OpenWRT, but I don&#039;t want to bother if OpenWRT doesn&#039;t feel it&#039;s worthwhile to make and track changes for Roofnet. So I am asking you, should I bother? will you adopt these changes? I don&#039;t want to be a pain in the ass constantly submitting bug reports if no one else @OpenWRT has any interest in Roofnet.</p><p>Regards,<br />Bob Keyes</p>									</div>

I do have a few changes, but they no doubt are not up to snuff, as far as not breaking other things. Maybe I&#039;ll just start mentioning the problems, and if you have time, you can fix them, if not, I&#039;ll try to pretty up my changes and submit them.</p><p>Broken stuff:</p><p>- I mentioned this one on irc: The firewall thinks of the WAN interface as the only &#039;upstream&#039;. When a roofnet node is not connected via the WAN port, it may nonetheless have a valid upstream - the mesh network. My hack of a patch is to check to see if vlan1 has been assigned an IP address, and if it has not, then treat srcr1 as the upstream. Maybe a more elegant solution would be to create a bridge consisting of one device: either the WAN port or SRCR1 or SRCR2 depending on settings handled elsewhere. This would require changes throughout OpenWRT, and may have other unforeseen problems. For instance, does it cause a performance hit? I have yet to try this.</p><p>- RoofNet is hard-coded to use 10.0.0.0/8 on its AP side. I just made a patch to change it to what I was using. But it would be more appropriate to pull the values out of the right place, which is /etc/config/network, right? Problem there is that there&#039;s two different ways of expressing network size, either the netmask or the maskbits. While I can convert these in my head, I am trying to think of a real clever, easy, robust way to do this in OpenWRT without using perl or whatever.</p><p>- Roofnet&#039;s startup scripts have hardcoded ATH1 as the monitor mode interface, even though they define an interface variable at other places in the script. This is bad, because in spite of what the madwifi-ng documentation says, you can&#039;t create a VAP interface after having created a monitor mode interface, and have it work. Therefore, if you want more than one VAP, you have to create them before you call roofnet&#039;s initialization scripts, and roofnet has to know what the number of the interface is. For now, I have just hardcoded it to use ATH4 as the monitor mode interface. Not really an elegant solution.</p><br /><p>Room for improvement:</p><p>- Roofnet currently has srcr1 and srcr2 interfaces, of which srcr2 is useless. This is expansion room for future protocol development. It would be useful to have menuconfig options for srcr1 and srcr2, as most people will only ever use srcr1</p><p>- Berlin Roofnet is a modified roofnet. It would be handy to have their modifications available as a patch, perhaps even as another device, able to operate at the same time as the original MIT roofnet. Another possible compile-time option.</p><p>Now do you see why I haven&#039;t just filed bug reports and uploaded a patch?</p>									</div>
