					<p>I have a WRT54G-TM which is basically a WRT54GL with additional FLASH and RAM.&nbsp; I have been running OpenWRT on this thing for several years.&nbsp; Recently I was experimenting with VLANs and managed to lose the ability to access the web page.&nbsp; Whatever I did also prevented me be able to access it in failsafe mode.&nbsp; I also could not get TFTP to work for loading a new image, something I have done many times.</p><p>So then I whipped out my JTAG adapter and successfully connected.&nbsp; I have successfully erased NVRAM and the KERNEL.&nbsp; Once I did this I am able to TFTP an image onto the router without error.&nbsp; I am even able to JTAG a kernel on to the router.</p><p>So the problem is that no matter what I do the router does not boot into the kernel.&nbsp; It just seems to stay in the bootloader with the light flashing.&nbsp; Even though the TFTP transfer completes successfully the router never reboots it just keeps flashing it green LED, I have waited 30 minutes for this to happen.</p><p>Anybody have an idea on what I can try next?&nbsp; I am thinking there is not a hardware problem here because I know it was working before I started messing with the VLAN settings and all these other things seem to work OK.</p>									</div>

					<p>What about serial console (port.serial in the wiki)? I would try that way before starting to mess with JTAG.</p>									</div>
