					<p>Using Opkg I&#039;d like to update two different Linux 3.16 based RFS&#039;s partitions. They are both mounted read only &amp; there is a data partition, which via aufs, does the write overlays. How can I do an upgrade to each partition such that I get an atomic update (all or nothing). Is there an opkg way to do this? My current approach is running update/install/upgrade under chroot/chdir in the non-booted rfs partition, after mounting it r/w, but I always get non-zero exit codes from the upgrade, even though there are no &#039;collected errors&#039; reported. Before trying to go further I just wanted to see if this was a good approach or if there was a more standard way to do this? Thanks for any input.</p>									</div>
