I knew that - and had shut off the fan. The problem I was seeing was the WAN LED not illuminating.<br />I did find the problem. In luci the next LED setting was for a USB device. It had the mamba:white:wan setting in it. Removing this fixed the problem. Since I don&#039;t have any USB devices attached I&#039;m not sure how it got that way although I may have done it somewhere along the way. </p><p>Thank you developers for all the work you have put into this software.</p>									</div>

					<p>Have you tried flashing with Kaloz or lifehacksback firmwares? I only used those ones.</p><p>@lifehacksback I have noticed that I can&#039;t use the echo 128 &gt; /sys/devices/pwm_fan/hwmon/hwmon0/pwm1 command on your firmware (only possible on Kaloz FW). Is it possible for you to implement that (or bsoft&#039;s auto-fan control)? sensors command returns a temperature of ~57 degrees on my WRT1900ac. With the fan set at 128 temperature goes down to 45 degrees while remaining quiet enough.</p><p>As for DavidMcWRT request to have wifi off by default.
