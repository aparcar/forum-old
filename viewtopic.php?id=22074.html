					<p>I am new to the forum, and also in OWRT. I have an atom 1.6Gzh dual core, and i installed a sata adaptor to cf, where i installed the kamikaze image. After i boot from cf, everything went ok, but after that the kernel log was that kernel panic, can&#039;t locate rootfs. I read somewhere in this forum that OWRT plovides no compatibillity with sata, and i must compile another kernel with this support... Is this true?</p><p> Secondly, i buy a ide cf adaptor, and i boot to owrt without problem, but i can&#039;t understatnd if the owrt can use both kernels. Kernel log said: </p><p>DMI 2.4 present.<br />Intel MultiProcessor Specification v1.4<br />Virtual Wire compatibility mode.<br />OEM ID: INTEL Product ID: APIC at: 0xFEE00000<br />Processor #0 6:12 APIC version 20<br />Processor #2 6:12 APIC version 20<br />WARNING: NR_CPUS limit of 1 reached. Processor ignored.</p><p>I suppose that only one kernel is used, how can i use both of them. One friend tell me that in my hardware is better to use a linux distro like debian or gentoo, but i prefer playing with OWRT. Finally, i put a wireless card called R5H High Power Mikrotik 802.11a with chipset&nbsp; Atheros AR5414A. The led of the wireless card is not always on, and in folder /lib/wireless there is no driver for it... When i installed temprarrily a gentoo distro, the led of the card is always on. Are this card supported from OWRT, and if no, what i am supposed to do in order to install the correct driver?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bekiaris</strong> on 7 Oct 2009, 09:21)</p>
