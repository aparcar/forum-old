					<p>It may be possible. Inside the downloadable Firmware Upgrade 10 DMG file, there is a file called CR2-v2.bin, which seems to have the right size to be a firmware image. To be precise, it is 16 bytes larger than expected, so this seems like a header, which needs to be stripped off.<br />To unbrick, you would follow these instructions from the <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-mr3040#manual_flash_under_u-boot_serial_console">wiki</a>. But instead of all the pain of setting up a TFTP server, I would transfer via serial line using Kermit (data transfer takes a few minutes, but usually it takes longer to get TFTP running). So, in uboot, these would be your commands:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>loadb 0x81000000</code></pre></div><p>Transfer stripped-off CR2-v2.bin using Kermit in your terminal program.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>erase 0x9f020000 +0x360000
cp.b  0x81000000 0x9f020000 0x360000
bootm 0x9f020000</code></pre></div><p>In the worst case, you can send it back to let the vendor flash a new firmware - they may just charge for shipping.</p>									</div>
