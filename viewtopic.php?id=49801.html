					<p>In short I have been a dd-wrt user for several years now. I flashed my two wrt54gl&#039;s router immediately when I got them from the store and I was happy with dd-wrt in fact. When I did a firewall test from the GRC website it passed easily. I just disabled the ping and that was that. Also set some restrictive firewall rules after that and I felt safe. </p><p>Now due to various circumstances dd-wrt was not any more working for me and I flashed both of them with openwrt. So now I have loads of questions. For one how come I can not pass the GRC&#039;s firewall test. Even when I manage to disable the ping on wan side with one router I still failed the firewall test and it was very odd since no specific ports were indicated to be open but it still detected some thing I guess. So that is my first question.</p>									</div>

					<p>To pass grc test, you have to use DROP instead of reject on ping and avoid common ports, so if you use remote administration over ssh on wan, you should remap your ssh port to other-than-22, like 2222.

					<p>Allow-ping is just a rule name, it is there from openwrt default config, I didn&#039;t bother to change that so you can easier find the rule.

					<p>Then it must be as jow said. If you have comodo configured correctly, you can try to directly connect just your machine. I think even windows 7 with default firewall set as connected to the public internet does not accept any connections, but I don&#039;t know if it rejects, or drops.</p><p>If you have openwrt, unless configured otherwise, the default is this: reject everything, accept ping. So edit /etc/config/firewall and change the rules REJECT to DROP &amp; drop pings, then you will be stealth, or your ISP messes with ports, as jow said. I heard, that many cable companies block ports, even port 80.</p>									</div>

					<p>You see the funny thing about this is that I have two wrt54gl routers. I have flashed both with the same openwrt build but neither pass the grc port scan test. Even the one that I use at the &quot;office&quot; with all sorts of crazy windows machines connected shows no open ports on the grc test and even when the ping is disabled it wont pass for some reason. It is really odd to me why that would be so but that does not bother me as much as to see open ports being detected when I know I have not done any thing to open/port foreward those ports and the ISP is not the offending party either.</p>									</div>
