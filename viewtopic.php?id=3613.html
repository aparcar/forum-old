					<p>We are very interested in using OpenWRT as it provides many useful benefits.</p><p>It is essential however that we find a box which is at least as powerful and as sensitive as the SENAO CB3+, which can put out 200mW AND has a sensitivity of 92dBM @ 1Mbs.</p><p>Can anyone tell me which of the available boxes are the most sensitive and most powerful?</p><p>And can you provide the figures.</p><p>Of most interest are the linksys wrt-54g(s) - anyone know how powerful / sensitive these boxes are?</p><p>Thanks a lot.</p>									</div>

					<p>Why not just <a href="http://www.broadcom.com/collateral/pb/94712-PB02-R.pdf">check the specs?</a>. It&#039;s throwing an error right now but iirc -95dbm at 1mbs and output up to ~250mw, but note that you might fry the chip at that output. HW v4 uses the BCM5352 which I can&#039;t find the datasheet for but generally newer generations have at least the same sensitivity.</p><p>Having done wireless for over 10 years and run radios at up to 500mw, I&#039;ve never found much advantage to going beyond ~100mw output preferring the more balanced approach of just increasing antenna gain if required.</p><p>- DL</p>									</div>
