					<p>I found a little more explanation here: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=55452">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=55452</a></p><p>Sounds like in order to route traffic or to access the management interface (web or ssh, or any other services hosted on the router itself) then the vlan needs to include one of the CPU interfaces.&nbsp; Apparently, they can be tagged or untagged, but if you have _any_ tagged then they must _all_ be tagged.&nbsp; In addition, it sounds like the WAN port is on separate hardware from the other 4 ports and so even if they are on the same vlan it won&#039;t do hardware switching, but will do switching in software which will be cpu intensive and I imagine probably pretty slow.&nbsp; So I probably won&#039;t want to add the WAN port to the rest of the switch for performance reasons, although I may give it a try (this is a small office router, so I won&#039;t be able to test it out until after-hours).</p>									</div>

					<div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>I imagine probably pretty slow.</p></blockquote></div><p>Just to update on my last post - I actually added the wan port into the same vlan as the rest of the switch and did a speed test.&nbsp; I still got full gigabit speed and it didn&#039;t put any additional load on the cpu, so it seems I can use that port as an extra switch port, no problem.</p><p>Update: FYI, routing speed is a different story - this TP-Link TL-WR1043ND v2 is only able to get ~300mbps of throughput as a router.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jdinkel</strong> on 9 Apr 2016, 04:58)</p>
