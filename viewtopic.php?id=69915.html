					<p>(Correct me if its a common known issue or if I made some stupid mistake.)</p><p>Today I get my new WRT3200ACM and start to play around. Everything is fine until I try the USB-to-TTL thing:</p><p>I picked a TTL-USB cable which has been working perfectly with my old router (TP-Link wr1041n). I connected the cable with the router &amp; PC correctly. However, when I turn on the power, 6 of the LEDs (the 2 for wifi &amp; the 4 for LAN) blinked once and then all LEDs are off forever. The boot process looks like being &quot;blocked&quot; by something and nothing is transmitted via the serial port.</p><p>Then I saw #12 of the thread &quot;Did I just brick my router? Linksys WRT1900AC&quot; in this forum (I don&#039;t have the permission to put a link here, sorry) and realized that I&#039;m facing exactly the same issue: <strong>If PIN2 (TX on the router) is physically connected to the USB-TTL cable before the power is on, the boot will be blocked.</strong> But if I keep that pin physically disconnected, turn on the power first, and then immediately connect that pin, I&#039;ll be able to get those regular information (uboot &amp; etc) from the serial port.</p><p>The post above is a WRT1900 v2 and my unit is WRT3200ACM. At first I thought this to be expected for WRT series routers but a youtube video connecting a WRT1200 using TTL-USB proved that I was wrong.</p><p>The cable I&#039;m using is &quot;silicon labs cp210x usb to uart bridge&quot;. Not sure if that&#039;s the problem of the cable itself. Anyway, this seems weird. Has anyone seen this before?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>swgr</strong> on 19 Feb 2017, 14:36)</p>

					<p>I have seen practically the same with Netgear WNDR3700. USB connection had to be made after powering the router. And to capture the early u-boot log you had to be quick. </p><p>I don&#039;t remember if it was just that TX,&nbsp; but roughly similar in any case.</p><p>EDIT:<br />My USB-TTL cable is similar as yours, so this might be related to that.<br />I just checked it: silicon labs cp210x usb</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 19 Feb 2017, 15:22)</p>

					<p>I tried to use my Arduino MEGA 2560 board as an USB-to-TTL and the same thing happened -- it works with my old TP-Link wr1041n perfectly, but for Linkedsys WRT3200ACM I must delay the connection of TX pin in order to boot the unit.</p>									</div>
