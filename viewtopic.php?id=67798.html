					<p>Looks like the is a problem with your platform (brcm63xx/generic). Apparently its whole 15.05.1 LuCI download directory is currently empty:&nbsp; <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05.1/brcm63xx/generic/packages/luci/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal … ages/luci/</a></p><p>LuCI is for the most parts quite platform-independent (with the exception of a few binaries related to real-time charts), so I suggest that you download luci-app-ddns for another platform and manually install the .ipk file. The ddns app is purely scripts, so it is comptible. You could use e.g. bcrm63/smp, which is the closest platform:<br /><a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05.1/brcm63xx/smp/packages/luci/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal … ages/luci/</a></p><p>direct link to the ddns app: <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05.1/brcm63xx/smp/packages/luci/luci-app-ddns_2.2.4-1_all.ipk">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal … -1_all.ipk</a><br />wget that, and then &quot;opkg install luci-app-ddns_2.2.4-1_all.ipk&quot;</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 29 Sep 2016, 10:20)</p>
