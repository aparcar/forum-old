					<p>i&#039;m very familiar with the ea4500 and congratulations.&nbsp; you have selected the right firmware from oem linksys to openwrt but it appears you have missed a few more steps.&nbsp; wireless is turned off by default hence no wireless but the lan ports are working once you have successfully flashed to openwrt.&nbsp; use a lan cable and putty into the router to install luci.</p><p>if you simply wish to give up and remove openwrt then follow the wiki to return back to stock.&nbsp; read the part about inducing three failed reboots.&nbsp; see method 2.</p><p><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/ea4500#back_to_the_original_stock_firmware">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/ea â€¦ k_firmware</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Trunk builds, which are the wiki suggested option for this device, do not include a web interface by default. You must login by SSH, connect to the internet, and install Luci to get one. This could be more explicit in the wiki. There are several other issues with running trunk builds if you are not familiar with openwrt.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drawz</strong> on 16 May 2016, 01:02)</p>
