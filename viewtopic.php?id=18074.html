					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m a newB and I have a newB question.</p><p>I recently flashed Asus WL-500gP with squashfs and Kamikaze 7.09.</p><p>The was instalation completed succesfully. After changing password, the router is ready, BUT:<br />1) DHCP assigns IP address automatically to the connected machine, which is OK<br />2) I cannot access network through WAN interface. When I try to acces internet, e.g. for download of package (ipkg), the<br />hosts are unreachable.<br />3) when I reflash back to original firmware, everything works. Looks like NVRAM variables are retained.<br />4) I cannot ping ISP gateway, DNS server, simply nothing.</p><p>Em I missing some part of configuration steps regarding OpenWRT, routing ? Do I have to manually edit routing tables ?</p><p>Regards</p><p>Ex</p>									</div>
