					<p>Hello everyone, </p><p>I try to make an hotspot with the Tp-Link archer c20i, for that I create a Firmware with the imagebuilder packets. On my image I just add coova-chilli, openvpn-openssl and vim. It&#039;s work, but I want to erase some default configuration of openwrt (firewall for example). So I have create a new file to erase /etc/config/firewall. After that my Archer C20i is briked, it&#039;s work because he diffuse my SSID but all ports are closed. So I have a few questions ;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- How can I restore an image from a briked router ? jtag ? <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- How can I delete some default file of openwrt ? <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- The TP-Link archer c2 AC750 is supported by openwrt or not ? I can&#039;t push a firmeware in it.</p><p>Thanks in advance for your answers. </p><p>Best regards. </p><p>d0ctrine</p>									</div>
