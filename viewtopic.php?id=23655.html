					<p>Hi--</p><p>I live on a sailboat, and am constantly moving and using various WiFi AP&#039;s.&nbsp; </p><p>I want my Linksys WRT54GL (it has the latest release version of Kamikaze on it) to:</p><p>1) Connect to a specific AP in Client mode (call this AP &quot;Shore&quot; for this discussion)<br />2) Create a AP for boat use (Call this AP &quot;Boat&quot;)<br />3) Link the &quot;Shore&quot; AP to the &quot;Boat&quot; AP, as well as route all data from Shore to the LAN ports.&nbsp; NAT is fine, as the internal network devices should be able to talk to each other, but don&#039;t need to talk to the LAN on the other side of the Shore AP- just the internet.&nbsp; Also, I want the internal devices to DHCP if at all possible.</p><p>The reason I want to do this is so that all my local devices associate to the &quot;Boat&quot; AP, and I simply change the &quot;Shore&quot; AP stuff when I move around.</p><p>I was thinking I would have to have two routers, but OpenWRT looks like it can do that- I was able to get both an AP and Client mode going last night, but couldn&#039;t figure out exactly what bridge settings I needed and whatnot.</p><p>I looked around online, and see lots of partial answers, but the oldwiki vs newwiki appears to be hiding the magic bullet I&#039;m looking for.</p><p>Is this possible?&nbsp; </p><p>I apologize if this is a stupid question!</p><p>Thanks,<br />-Ryan</p>									</div>

					<p>To have a WRT54GL, WRT54GS or WRT54-TM box (may work with others, but <strong><span class="bbu">THIS WILL NOT WORK ON A WRT54G</span></strong>) connect to a wireless network (Shore) and rebroadcast it as another network (Boat) do the following</p><p>The following variables are assumed: <br />**************<br />Shore SSID: Shore<br />Shore Channel: 5<br />Shore Encryption: None<br />**************<br />Boat SSID: Boad<br />Boat Encryption: None<br />**************</p><p>1. Login to the WAP website<br />2. Go to Network&gt;WiFi&gt;WL0<br />3. Check the Enable box<br />4. Select a channel (This MUST match the channel used by the Shore network)<br />5. To setup wireless network Shore:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a. Go to the Interfaces section<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;b. Set ESSID to Shore<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;c. Set Network to WAN<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;d. Set Mode to Client<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;e. Set Encryption to None<br />6. To setup wireless network Boat:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a.

					<p>Thanks Aaron, but this doesn&#039;t seem to be working for me.</p><p>Using the scan tool built into the web interface, I determined that the channel was 8.&nbsp; So I set it up as you suggested:</p><p>device wl0<br />enabled<br />broadcomm<br />channel 8<br />transmit power (blank)</p><p>interfaces:<br />essid: shore<br />network: wan<br />mode: client<br />encryption: none</p><p>essid: boat<br />network: lan<br />mode: access point<br />encryption: none</p><p>Using my PC, I can connect to Boat.&nbsp; It gets an IP address (192.168.1.237), a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, and shows it&#039;s unencrypted.&nbsp; However, when I try to connect to a site, the connection times out.&nbsp; Trying to ping from the PC also times out.&nbsp; Setting the DNS to 4.4.4.4 (Googles Nameserver), still times out.&nbsp; Now the Shore AP does require a login, but traditionally what happens is that on my first connection, it returns the login page regardless of what URL I am trying to connect to.</p><p>I question the network&#039;s above- How does it know to bridge the wan network from shore to the lan?&nbsp; Or am I missing something else fundamental?</p><p>If I change the boat network to wan, when I go to a page (<a href="http://www.woot.com">http://www.woot.com</a>), on the PC, the address in the bar changes to http:///, and then says that it&#039;s an invalid address.</p><p>If I change the boat network to lan and the shore network to lan, I still can&#039;t connect.</p><p>I did look over the client mode page; and I&#039;m pretty sure that I could setup my router to be a client, and server the pages over the LAN ports.&nbsp; It&#039;s the LAN AND AP that&#039;s got me stumped.</p><p>Thanks!<br />-Ryan</p>									</div>

					<p>I think I missed a critical step, go to the WAP website and go to Network &gt; Interfaces &gt; WAN and check the &quot;Bridge interfaces&quot; box, I tried it on my 54G here and it wouldn&#039;t work as a client until I checked that box.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>I question the network&#039;s above- How does it know to bridge the wan network from shore to the lan</p></blockquote></div><p>With &quot;Bridge interfaces&quot; enabled and the &quot;Shore&quot; network terminating the the wan, it acts like it would if you had an Ethernet cable from the &quot;Shore&quot; network plugged info the &quot;internet&quot; port of the WAP.

					<p>Hope this isn&#039;t a stupid question but you are using the real ssid of the access point on land and not literally &quot;Shore&quot; right? And that AP is open with no encryption on Channel 8? Can you successfully connect to it directly with a laptop wifi?

					<p>For antenna info, this looks like a good thread: <a href="http://www.wirelessforums.org/alt-internet-wireless/need-external-antenna-wrt54gl-39665.html">http://www.wirelessforums.org/alt-inter … 39665.html</a> in short: only use one antenna and use the RH (as looking from the front) connection</p><p>On your problem: it looks like the boat link is not doing something right (as seen by the lack of a link number).

What I am wondering is maybe you have a network clash? That is, you aren&#039;t trying to run the same subnet (192.168.1.0/24) that the shore network is running are you? If so that will not work (for routed mode) and you&#039;ll need to specify a different subnet for your LAN.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve been slammed the last couple of days; I&#039;ll have to check your settings.&nbsp; In looking at them, I don&#039;t see much different from what I was trying before (as far as I can tell).&nbsp; I did just check though, and the Shore SSID is assigning the Linksys client interface an IP address of 10.0.2.142, which is bridging to the LAN at 192.168.1.0/24.&nbsp; Currently, I then have an Apple Airport Express plugged into the LAN port, and it&#039;s my AP until I can sort this out.

					<p>Ooops, I noticed that after I posted and according to your output. One thing I see different is your wan configuration in your network config. You have this set:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>    option &#039;type&#039; &#039;bridge&#039;

I will check that out today as I have a little time to work with it. I would comment those 3 lines out and reboot and see if that fixes it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yep, just what I thought. Here&#039;s the bridge configuration with your config:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>bridge name     bridge id               STP enabled     interfaces

You only need the lan bridge because you are not going to use your wan ethernet port. My guess is if you want the bridge between the wan port and your second wireless interface the MAC addresses between eth0.0 and eth0.1 have to be unique (mine are the same, and the same as the bridge id). I&#039;m not 100% on that. The other thing that is different between your config and mine is that I have the wireless interfaces swapped. I&#039;m using wl0.1 for lan, you are using it for wan but I don&#039;t think that should matter.</p>									</div>
