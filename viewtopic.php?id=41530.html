					<p>Why there is still no Image for Gigagset SX76X (SX763) available in trunk?</p><p>Why the ugly-usb patch can&#039;t be added so it works out-of-the-box?<br />I&#039;ve found one developer that made image for this device, but his kernel is too old for me to run FXS ports that are available in the device! And some packages are missing. :-(<br />I&#039;d like to somehow download image from: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/lantiq/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/lantiq/</a><br />THe one from 12.09-beta doesn&#039;t work properly. :-(<br />The fix is for dwc_otg_ifx.c - I&#039;ve found info on: <a href="http://svn.dd-wrt.com/changeset/18256,">http://svn.dd-wrt.com/changeset/18256,</a> but DD-wrt doesnt work for me.<br />Please, keep up the good work and help me run this thing.<br />I cant go back to original firmware to get SIP working also... all the fws on the net doesnt work anymore on my device...</p><p>Regards,<br />A.</p>									</div>

					<p>No, the maintainer asked for a _runtime_ detection, the ifdef switch is a compile time selection, thats what he was referring to when stating that it will break all non-SX763 boards.</p><p>In the future all Lantiq board will share one common kernel build, only differentiated through device trees, therfore you cannot rely on any conditional compilation.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t really get the difference, but I&#039;m not a developer of the kernel tho - I thought that when I don&#039;t compile something in the code, it won&#039;t work. So if there&#039;s a switch which checks if something is Gigaset, then it will work.</p><p>THe other thing is - what&#039;s &#039;non-SX763&#039; meaning? SX763 is the only that have OpenWRT working as far as I can see on <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/gigaset/sx76x">OpenWRT website</a>...<br />It&#039;s really confusing.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>jow wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>In the future all Lantiq board will share one common kernel build, only differentiated through device trees, therfore you cannot rely on any conditional compilation.</p></blockquote></div><p>What does it mean for me, as a OpenWRT-without-USB user? That the patch may be included/work? <br />And could you estimate the meaning of &#039;future&#039;? </p><p><strong>For devs</strong>: if there&#039;s someone willing to test patch of that &#039;runtime patch&#039; on SX763 - I have serial access to it, can check and give back feedback, if needed.<br />I still don&#039;t really think it&#039;s impossible to code that &#039;if&#039;-switch into kernel. I just don&#039;t know how...</p><p>Thanks and regards,<br />Andrew</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>andrut</strong> on 10 Jan 2013, 14:50)</p>
