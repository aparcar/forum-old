					<p>Hi all.&nbsp; Has anybody had any success with using a USB ISDN modem with openwrt?<br />I have a Microlink modem connected to an ASUS WL-500G, which should work with the<br />hisax_st5481 driver. I have tried numerous things which I suppose may be of interest to<br />some.</p><p>1. The build-root (stable from CVS) version can not compile the hisax_st5481 module<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;as there seems to be a problem with some USB-related variables. After a lot of<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;searching around I found that the problem is caused by 200-i4l.patch which, when<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;applied, reverts the isdn drivers to a version that is not compatible with current<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;version of the kernel (2.4.30). The compile fails in st5481.h (look at line 11709 of<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;the patch where &quot;struct usb_ctrlrequest&quot; is replaced with &quot;devrequest&quot;...)</p><p>2. Without the 200-i4l.patch and 201-hfc_usb_backport.patch patches, I can compile<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;the ISDN drivers without problems. Nevertheless, insmod isdn.o complains about<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;undefined symbol &quot;strcpy&quot;. I managed to overcome this by statically linking<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;a custom version of strcpy with the isdn.o module (I have a kernel patch if anyone<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;is interested).</p><p>3. Next I made an ipkg of ISDN tools, which can be found at:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/~chazapis/isdn4k-utils_v3.2p1-1_mipsel.ipk">http://www.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/~chazapis/ … mipsel.ipk</a> <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;This includes isdnctrl, ipppd and imon (which requires ncurses). The build-root<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;patch for that is in <a href="http://www.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/~chazapis/ipkg_isdn4k-utils.patch">http://www.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/~chazapis/ … tils.patch</a><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;(again if anyone is interested).</p><p>Everything seems fine with the drivers (at least at the version printing level).<br />This is what I get from logread:</p><p>---</p><p>Jan&nbsp; 1 02:25:51 (none) kern.notice kernel: ISDN subsystem Rev: 1.1.4.1/1.1.4.1/1<br />.1.4.1/1.1.4.1/1.1.4.1/1.1.4.1 loaded<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 02:26:00 (none) kern.info kernel: HiSax: Linux Driver for passive ISDN ca<br />rds<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 02:26:00 (none) kern.info kernel: HiSax: Version 3.5 (module)<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 02:26:00 (none) kern.info kernel: HiSax: Layer1 Revision 1.1.4.1<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 02:26:00 (none) kern.info kernel: HiSax: Layer2 Revision 1.1.4.1<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 02:26:00 (none) kern.info kernel: HiSax: TeiMgr Revision 1.1.4.1<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 02:26:00 (none) kern.info kernel: HiSax: Layer3 Revision 1.1.4.1<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 02:26:00 (none) kern.info kernel: HiSax: LinkLayer Revision 1.1.4.1<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 02:26:00 (none) kern.info kernel: HiSax: Approval certification failed be<br />cause of<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 02:26:00 (none) kern.info kernel: HiSax: unauthorized source code changes<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 02:26:05 (none) kern.info kernel: hiax_st5481: ST5481 USB ISDN driver v0.<br />1.0<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 02:26:05 (none) kern.info kernel: usb.c: registered new driver st5481_usb<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 02:26:05 (none) kern.info kernel: st541: found adapter VendorId 0483, Pro<br />ductId 4810, LEDs 2<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 02:26:05 (none) kern.info kernel: HiSax: Card 1 Protocol EDSS1 Id=st5481_<br />usb0 (0)<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 02:26:05 (none) kern.info kernel: HiSax: DSS1 Rev. 1.1.4.1<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 02:26:05 (none) kern.info kernel: HiSax: 2 channels added<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 02:26:05 (none) kern.info kernel: HiSax: MAX_WAITING_CALLS added</p><p>---</p><p>But the modem does not work...

					<p>Update:</p><p>Nobody has replied to my post for days... Nevertheless, I found that<br />the isdn patch (200-i4l.patch) originates from the official <a href="http://www.isdn4linux.de">www.isdn4linux.de</a> distribution.<br />It is the diff of the isdn drivers CVS version when applyied to the 2.4.x<br />kernel tree. The USB &quot;devrequest&quot; in the st5481 driver is present in<br />the CVS version, while updated in the latest 2.4.x kernel... Go figure...</p><p>However, the patch provides a kernel option for USB ISDN adapters using the HFC-USB<br />chipset. So, I dumped the Microlink ISDN modem and bought a Tornado WJT Pocket II:<br /><a href="http://www.allieddata.com/asp/products_product.asp?menu=products&amp;productid=139&amp;brandid=2">http://www.allieddata.com/asp/products_ … ;brandid=2</a><br />This is widely available in Greece and must actually be the same as the<br />Billion Tiny USB TA: <a href="http://www.billion.com/product/isdn/biptiny.htm">http://www.billion.com/product/isdn/biptiny.htm</a><br />And the Gazel 128 USB: <a href="http://www.bewan.fr/bewan/produits/rnis/gazel128usb.php">http://www.bewan.fr/bewan/produits/rnis/gazel128usb.php</a></p><p>Then I compiled a new ISDN kernel module with a custom strcpy which can be found<br />here: <a href="http://www.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/~chazapis/kmod-usb-isdn_2.4.30-brcm-2_mipsel.ipk">http://www.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/~chazapis/ … mipsel.ipk</a><br />This module works with the ASUS fine.</p><p>Then I bought a USB hub (the WL-500G has only one USB port), and a USB stick.<br />I installed asterisk on the stick (from the ipkg) and after a lot of customization of<br />the asterisk installation and configuration files, I now have an ISDN pbx running at<br />home with 4 SIP users sharing the two ISDN channels (the 4 SIP users come from<br />2 Linksys PAP2 ATAs).</p><p>If anyone is interested in trying this, I have to note some important asterisk stuff:<br />* You will need chan_modem.so, chan_modem_i4l.so and a modem.conf.<br />&nbsp; You can find those here: <a href="http://www.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/~chazapis/asterisk-modem.tar.gz">http://www.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/~chazapis/ … dem.tar.gz</a><br />&nbsp; Edit modem.conf and set &quot;driver=i4l&quot; and (VERY IMPORTANT) &quot;dtmfmode=i4l&quot;.<br />&nbsp; If you use asterisk for DTMF detection you will get 99% CPU usage and crapy sound.<br />* Edit modules.conf and load only the _absolutely_ necessary. These router<br />&nbsp; devices are very low on memory. I also created a swapfile in the USB stick<br />&nbsp; in case things get really tight.<br />* Run everything in one codec, ideally slinear or ulaw/alaw. I use ulaw everywhere.<br />&nbsp; The &quot;show translation&quot; command states that ulaw&lt;-&gt;slin conversion needs 1 msec.<br />&nbsp; I converted all asterisk sounds from the 1.2 distribution to ulaw (you can<br />&nbsp; find those here: <a href="http://www.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/~chazapis/asterisk-sounds-1.2-ulaw.tar.gz)">http://www.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/~chazapis/ … aw.tar.gz)</a>.<br />&nbsp; Put the sounds in .../usr/lib/asterisk/sounds. Also I use voicemail and store messages<br />&nbsp; in ulaw format.<br />* If you want music-on-hold check this out: <a href="http://www.voip-info.org/wiki-Asterisk+mpg123+faking+it">http://www.voip-info.org/wiki-Asterisk+mpg123+faking+it</a><br />&nbsp; I use Switch (<a href="http://www.nch.com.au/switch/index.html">http://www.nch.com.au/switch/index.html</a>) to convert files in raw format.<br />&nbsp; Use .raw output and set the codec to &quot;16 bit PCM (LE)&quot; format, &quot;8000&quot; sample and &quot;1 - Mono&quot;<br />&nbsp; channels. Then put your files in .../usr/lib/asterisk/mohraw and rename them so they end<br />&nbsp; in &quot;.mp3&quot;. You can play the files with a custom music-on-hold script like the &quot;rawplayer&quot;<br />&nbsp; found in the voip-info wiki.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi!</p><p>I&#039;m using (well, really plan to use) the Asus WL500GD (Deluxe, or X) as the main platform.<br />Why wl500gd? It has 32MB RAM, USB (4x 2.0!), 2x COM and 3x GPIO pins available (it seems like the hardware was made just for &quot;upgrade&quot; and &quot;hacking&quot; - all extensions are on pin haders, nicely marked... a lot of extra space in the housing...)<br />It has only 4MB of flash but this is enough for what I need and there is always the usb where you can add usb sticks (or a read hdd) and have plenty of space.<br />I also need ISDN (I have same small usb-isdn modems which fit in the original router case/housing) that&#039;s why a usb port is a requirement.</p><p>The main reason of using kernel 2.6 is native ipsec support (besides all the other &quot;nice&quot; stuff).</p><p>I&#039;m not 100% sure but as the wl-hdd is using BC 47xx core and that is supported by OpenWrt, I suppose it should work.</p><p>Ah, I really do not need the wireless (at this time) so I do not care about that - as far as I know, the open-source wireless support for 2.6 is not jet &quot;production ready&quot;...</p><p>Regards,<br />MCulibrk</p>									</div>
