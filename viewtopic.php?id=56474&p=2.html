					<p>No double flashing is needed, It is enough to follow the most recently outlined steps. Doing an OpenWRT sysupgrade (downgrade) via telnet from trunk to Barrier Breaker is enough.</p><p>My original suggestion would have involved flashing to OEM via telnet sysupgrade, then flashing the newest OEM from the OEM UI, and the flashing OpenWRT BB from factory. It turns out that this is not required, so we could skip a few steps.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, Internet is needed if you download it like that. If you connect your ISP uplink (CATV/ADSL modem, etc) to the WAN port, it should automatically connect.</p><p>If you copy &amp; paste the text block into a text file on your OS X, one of your text editors will display line numbers.
