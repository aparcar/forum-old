					<p>Hello friends</p><p>Wake on Lan (from the internet) is an old topic and there are many thread about it but I still can&#039;t make it work on my OpenWrt router (Netgear N600 3700v2). I am trying to make all configuration using LuCi GUI.<br />As far as I know I have first to setup port forwarding. For that reason I&#039;ve created the following port forwarding rule (Network-&gt;Firewall-&gt;Port Forwards):</p><p>Rule is enabled<br />Name: &quot;WoL&quot;<br />Protocol: &quot;TCP+UDP&quot;<br />Source zone: &quot;wan&quot;<br />Source MAC address: &quot;&quot;<br />Source IP address: &quot;any&quot;<br />Source port: &quot;any&quot;<br />External IP address: &quot;any&quot;<br />External port: &quot;9&quot;<br />Internal zone: &quot;lan&quot;<br />Internal IP address: &quot;192.168.1.100 ([MAC ADDRRESS])&quot;<br />Internal port: &quot;9&quot;<br />Enable NAT Loopback: enabled<br />Extra arguments: &quot;&quot;</p><p>But I still can&#039;t wake up (from internet, not local LAN) my NAS which is directly connected to my router but it is possible to wake up my NAS from local LAN. <br />I have installed &quot;luci-app-wol&quot;. When I use luci-app-wol I am able to wake up my NAS only with etherwake but not with WoL.</p><p>Do I have to setup additional Traffic Rules or other General Settings?</p><p>My firmware: OpenWrt Barrier Breaker 14.07 / LuCI Trunk (0.12+svn-r10530)</p><p>Hope you can help me.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello everyone. I hoped that problem was solved in my case. Unfortunately it appeared again since I moved to a new apartment with another ISP. This time I don&#039;t have a modem. My router is connected directly to the house network. It is an absolutely new building.<br />Meanwhile I&#039;ve updated my OpenWrt to Chaos Calmer 15.05 and these are my new details when logged in:</p><p>Address: 192.168.183.182<br />Netmask: 255.255.255.0<br />Gateway: 192.168.183.1<br />DNS 1: 192.168.183.1</p><p>My public IP address is an absolutely different one 212.**.***.***</p><p>Hope you can help.</p>									</div>

					<p>Your are behind an upstream firewall; in bound services cannot therefore be published in this case. You&#039;d need to instead run something in your network to reach out to a cloud service (ie team viewer) to get access to within your network from that.</p>									</div>
