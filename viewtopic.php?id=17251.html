					<p>I have had a lot of problems trying to get this to work. Its under &quot;Advanced configuration options (for developers)&quot; in make menuconfig on trunk. I documented some of the problems (and workarounds) below but am still stuck on conflict between host and cross compilation version of struct sigcontext:</p><p><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/4078">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/4078</a></p><p>Also, as I read more, it seems gcj may not work with uclibc anyway:<br /><a href="http://www.uclibc.org/lists/buildroot/2008-April/008303.html">http://www.uclibc.org/lists/buildroot/2 â€¦ 08303.html</a><br />before I waste more time I wanted to know if anyone has gotten this option to work on _any_ platform?</p><p>I need gcj as neither jamvm nor sable have JDWP (remote debugging) support and PhoneME is nice and relatively easy to compile for kamikaze but does not unfortunately support enough of J2SE for me to use for my application.</p><p>Thank you<br />Misha</p>									</div>
