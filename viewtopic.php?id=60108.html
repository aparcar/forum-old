					<p>I&#039;m working on porting OpenWRT to some new hardware. A lot of this is new to me (previous embedded work has been on much simpler systems - PICs, etc), so I&#039;m learning a lot as I go. </p><p>Anyway, I&#039;m working on the Makefile found in openwrt/target/linux/ar71xx/image/Makefile</p><p>I&#039;ve added line 2137 to that makefile:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>$(eval $(call SingleProfile,EnGenius,64k,EAP1200H,eap1200h,EAP1200H,ttyS0,115200,$$(eap1200h_mtdlayout),KRuImage,,0x61))</code></pre></div><p>I can&#039;t work out what the last parameter, &#039;0x61&#039; is used for. In fact, I can&#039;t even work out where this parameter eventually goes. </p><p>As far as I can trace, there&#039;s a definition on line 942 of that makefile:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>SINGLE_PROFILES:=

# $(1)      : name of image build method to be used, e.g., TPLINK-LZMA, AthLzma.
# $(2)      : name of the build template to be used, e.g. 64k, 64kraw, 128k, etc.
# $(3)      : name of the profile to be defined.
# $(4)      : board name.
# $(5)~$(7) : arguments for $(mkcmdline)
#        board=$(1) console=$(2),$(3)
# $(8)~$(14): extra arguments.
define SingleProfile
  # $(1): action name, e.g. loader, buildkernel, squashfs, etc.
  define Image/Build/Profile/$(3)
    $$(call Image/Build/Template/$(2)/$$(1),$(1),$(4),$$(call mkcmdline,$(5),$(6),$(7)),$(8),$(9),$(10),$(11),$(12),$(13),$(14))
  endef
  SINGLE_PROFILES += $(3)
endef</code></pre></div><p>So this parameter, now $10, gets passed to another macro, &quot;Image/Build/Template/$(2)/$$(1)&quot;, but from there I can&#039;t follow what happens. </p><p>I would appreciate some help on this! I have already built and programmed the router with my first effort firmware - it goes into kernel panic, but fortunately the bootloader is intact. </p><p>A.</p>									</div>

					<p>It is very similar to the ESR1750, chipset is QCA9557-AT4A and Atheros AR8035-A Ethernet with one PHY. 5GHz radio is on a PCIe card. </p><p>So basically, a 2-radio wireless AP :-)</p><p>I did get this working, it was a pretty obscure problem (especially as this pushed my knowledge to the limit). It was ultimately because I based it on the ESR1750, which at the time was some kind of patch on the main trunk version of OpenWRT. There was some essential bit of c code which had to go into a version of machtypes.h that was being created by scripts. Or something like that.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bicyclerepairman</strong> on 13 May 2016, 08:02)</p>

					<p>So, what were the changes that were needed on the makefile and machtypes.h to properly build for the EAP1200h?&nbsp; Did you jot them down and can you share?&nbsp; Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>I made changes to a number of files, and kept a list of them:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/target/linux/ar71xx/generic/profiles/engenius.mk
    adds new router as option in &quot;make menuconfig&quot; 

/target/linux/ar71xx/config-4.1 
    assorted kernel config stuff

/target/linux/ar71xx/base-files/lib/upgrade/platform.sh
    something to do with image checking (router name added at line 216, might actually be needed at line 442)

/target/linux/ar71xx/patches-4.1/700-MIPS-ath79-add-openwrt-machines.patch
    adds entry to &quot;make kernel_menuconfig&quot;, and includes new router .c file 

/target/linux/ar71xx/base-files/lib/ar71xx.sh
    adds device name to some list (names may not match - line 469 - double entry to try to make sure) 

/target/linux/ar71xx/image/Makefile
    line 1273: flash map, line 2201 - SingleProfile call (last (10th) parameter is &quot;board code&quot; - took a wild guess!), (line 2310 - Multiprofile stuff - not sure if needed)

/target/linux/ar71xx/files/arch/mips/ath79/mach-eap1200h.c
    GPIO, MAC address, board set-up, etc

/target/linux/ar71xx/base-files/etc/hotplug.d/firmware/11-ath10k-caldata
    ath10k (PCIe 5Ghz) caldata and MAC (5G MAC adds 2 to eth0 MAC...) 

/target/linux/ar71xx/base-files/etc/uci-defaults/01_leds
    added at line 224: 
        ucidef_set_led_wlan &quot;wlan2g&quot; &quot;WLAN 2.4 GHz&quot; &quot;eap1200h:blue:wlan-2g&quot; &quot;phy1tpt&quot;
        ucidef_set_led_wlan &quot;wlan5g&quot; &quot;WLAN 5 GHz&quot; &quot;eap1200h:green:wlan-5g&quot; &quot;phy0tpt&quot;

/target/linux/ar71xx/base-files/etc/uci-defaults/02_network
    added line 349, under access points, as no ethernet switch:
        &quot;ucidef_set_interface_lan &quot;eth0&quot;&quot;

/target/linux/ar71xx/base-files/etc/diag.sh 
    just power LED, add around line 120:
        status_led=&quot;eap1200h:amber:power&quot; </code></pre></div><p>I also kept a copy of the changed files, but as some of them were patch files, it might take a little work to use them now.</p>									</div>
