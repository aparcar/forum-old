					<p>Hi,</p><p>I flashed the open WRT to my TL-WR, because my USB HDD couldnt be detected under the originial firmware, so i tried open WRT.</p><p>After I did all adjustements with the open WRT web interface I tried to save them. Then a message appears &quot;waiting for router&quot; but that message didnt dissapear for a long time, so I restarted the router.</p><p>But now I cant get on the Web interface any more. I tried to enter the failsafe mode (set my computer IP to 192.168.1.2 Subnet to 255.255.255.0 and opened up recvudp.exe then connectes the router to port 1 and started it it sends no messages no matter if I push the &quot;QSS&quot; button before starting)<br />please help me what can I do? Or how do I flash the original firmware?</p><p>regards</p>									</div>

					<p>How long did you wait? While you are saving stuff, just restarting it is generally a bad idea.</p><p>First of all, reset the settings using the small reset button on the back of the device. (you need a small, pen-like thing to press it) While the device is on, keep it pressed for a few seconds before releasing.</p><p>Try getting into failsafe using the reset button or try pressing both the reset button and the QSS button to get into failsafe mode. You need to keep them pressed until SYS blinks faster, by the way.</p><p>(Sidenote: I never had recvudp.exe work for me. Just sayin&#039;.)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vkins</strong> on 7 Nov 2012, 11:43)</p>

					<p>I waitet at least 10 minutes and nothing happened.</p><p>I tried to reset the Router with the little button first, but it has no effect at all. With the stock firmware the button worked fine.</p><p>If I press the &quot;QSS&quot; button on startup, wehen the SYS LED blinks, the SYS LED starts to blink faster. But I still cant open the web interface. But I can ping 192.168.1.1 and get an answer. What should I do if the LED blinks fast?</p><p>by the way thanks for your answer.</p><p>regards</p>									</div>

					<p>Great, I&#039;m glad that it worked for you.</p><p>You can use samba or an ftp server for direct access. (Samba guide: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/cifs.server?s">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/cifs.server?s</a>[]=samba )</p><p>For media-streaming purposes you can install the minidlna package.</p>									</div>
