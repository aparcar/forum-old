					<p>Greetings,</p><p>I&#039;m a longtime DD-WRT user who recently decided to try OpenWRT because of better opkg compatibility. Two days ago I flashed BARRIER BREAKER 14.07, r42625 onto my Netgear WNDR3700v4 and since that time, have experienced a series of firewall and connectivity headaches. I&#039;m clearly doing something wrong and need some expert advice.</p><p>Network Topology:<br />I operate offices at several project sites where my equipment is installed on a separate wired subnet. Unlike other users, this is not wishful thinking or a network misconfiguration, it is entirely by design and absolutely necessary. For years I have configured these installations on a number of different network devices without much difficulty, some OEM, others flashed with DD-WRT.</p><p>For simplicity, the basic procedure is described as follows: A router (&quot;subnet router&quot;) is attached to the primary Gateway (&quot;internet gateway&quot;) by connecting an ethernet cable between the LAN port of the &quot;internet gateway&quot; and WAN port of the &quot;subnet router&quot;, creating a separate subnet. I have administrative rights and can reconfigure any necessary settings.</p><p>Most network devices, including DD-WRT firmware, provide a convenient option to disable the firewall, a configuration often called &quot;Router Mode&quot;. This option has historically been used to provide subnet clients access to the Internet, groups of printers, other users, etc. I usually create routes on upstream devices such as the &quot;internet gateway&quot; which requires regular monitoring.</p><p>Of course an OpenWRT device can be configured to operate in &quot;Router Mode&quot; like any other router, however, simply disabling the firewall does not create the intended result. I spent a great deal of time searching the site, finding many comments that &quot;it couldn&#039;t be done&quot;, a few interesting hints, but no definitive solutions. Last night I experienced perfect connectivity bliss for about 30 minutes before the firewall kicked in with a vengeance. I&#039;m close to a solution and intend to share my results in a separate posting but only after the settings are scrutinized and the firewall is under control.</p><p>Symptoms have always included no Internet access and chronic generation of unusual MAC Addresses. Regularly include&nbsp; firewall settings that don&#039;t stick, firewall option checkboxes in GUI which briefly appear as LAN or WAN options, then quickly vanish, leaving the blank field &quot;unspecified -or- create&quot;, and subsequent text values added to these fields which are never saved. In CLI, the restart command: /etc/init.d/firewall restart, throws the error:&quot;Parse error (option/list command found before the first section) at line 2, byte 1&quot;, however, previously added configs have been removed and nothing I find matches the error.</p><p>There&#039;s also a known bug for this model regarding assignment of VLAN values but I&#039;m unsure if this could be the problem.</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p><p>UG</p><p>Here are the basic settings from /etc/firewall.user, /etc/config/firewall, and /etc/config/network.</p><p>firewall.user (what I would like to add but can&#039;t)<br />config rule<br />&nbsp;

					<p>Thanks for the reply HelloWorld,</p><p>You are correct, connectivity on three different subnets. <br />* My network (the &quot;LAN&quot;) is the downstream subnet 192.168.0.0/24, managed by the WNDR3700v4 with OpenWRT FW.<br />* Occasionally I need to access clients and configure the &quot;internet gateway&quot; 192.168.1.1 on the upstream subnet, 192.168.1.0/24<br />* Most importantly, I need WAN access for Internet, hosted by the &quot;internet gateway&quot; above.</p><p>This has nothing to do with Modem to Gateway bridging...it&#039;s a firewall issue. For the last 8 months my WNDR3700v4 with DD-WRT FW maintained flawless connectivity on all three subnets above.

After their removal, I was finally able to watch the firewall flush, rebuild, and post errors.

					<p>Success!!!</p><p>I finally have Internet access with full connectivity on all networks <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> Apparently the Internet issue was caused by using the GUI and entering a DNS setting in the wrong place.</p><p>After a sequence of tests, I removed some unnecessary entries in the firewall configs and posted the amended copy below.</p><p>Since this was largely a guessing game, I feel greatly relieved but somewhat disenchanted by the outcome of an empty learning experience. This would be far more satisfying and educational for myself and other readers if the following questions could be definitively answered by members who are more knowledgeable than myself.</p><p>1. Generally speaking, when conventional routers offer &quot;router mode&quot; or &quot;disable firewall&quot; options, are they the same or different, and what would the resulting configs or iptables look like?</p><p>2.

I assume the &quot;disable firewall&quot; option is equivalent to the raw iptables command to accept all traffic:iptables -I FORWARD -j ACCEPT, and is this correct?</p><p>4. Would this configuration have achieved the same result as my firewall configs posted below?</p><p>5. For most private networks protected by a firewall enabled on the &quot;internet gateway&quot;, what are the advantages or disadvantages of&nbsp; the &quot;disable firewall&quot; option vs more refined firewall configs? Packet collisions, security, unnecessary traffic???</p><p>6. Any comments on my final configs? Could they be simplified, improved, or the option masq &#039;1&#039; removed?</p><p>7. Any suggestions on how to overcome the most obvious limitation,&nbsp; a poorly defined upstream gateway? In my experience, this could often be resolved by using additional GUI settings that would point to this device as; ie: the DNS server, NTP server, adding static leases, netbios names, MAC addresses, enabling DNSMasq, etc.</p><p>As a new user, I find the GUI layout very confusing. The absolute defaults which guarantee connectivity on most routers (generally found on the first page or Startup tab), are scattered throughout the GUI interface in various places with at least four locations for entering DNS addresses. Still unsure which one finally triggered a working internet connection.<br />Are there any guides which describe each GUI page and the available options?</p><p>Any answers would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>Final firewall configs: /etc/config/firewall</p><p>config defaults<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option input ACCEPT<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option output ACCEPT<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option forward REJECT<br /># Uncomment this line to disable ipv6 rules<br /># option disable_ipv6 1</p><p>config zone<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option name lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; list network &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option input ACCEPT<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option output ACCEPT<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option forward ACCEPT</p><p>config zone<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option name wan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; list network &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; list network &#039;wan6&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option input ACCEPT<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option output ACCEPT<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option forward REJECT<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option masq 1</p><p>config forwarding<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option src lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option dest wan</p><p>config rule &#039;grant_ip_access_to_subnet&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option src &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option src_ip &#039;192.168.1.0/24&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option dest &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option dest_ip &#039;192.168.0.0/24&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;all&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option target &#039;ACCEPT&#039;</p><p># We need to accept udp packets on port 68,<br /># see <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/4108">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/4108</a><br />&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; SNIP &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>									</div>
