					<p>Hello, I have OpenWrt Chaos Clamer and I would like to make internet stable for WiFi users.</p><p>my scenario: router is in my small cafe, and I would like to make it stable. So, if someone will start to downloading something, internet must not be slow for another users. I would like something like auto-Bandwidth controlling... I don&#039;t want to set up exact speed on exact IP. My goal is just stability of WiFi&#039;s users.</p><p>I have found <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/sqm">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/sqm</a> this tutorial. Is this what I need?</p><p>Just tell me how is this possible and which tools I need. I will not ask dumb questions.<br />Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>@midler I think you would be pleased by how well the SQM-QoS works at making all your cafe users happy. It automatically shares the bandwidth between people, so everyone gets their &quot;fair share&quot;. Plus everyone gets good latency all the time.</p><p>And it&#039;s easy to set up - you already found the SQM Howto tutorial. Try it. It&#039;ll take you 10 minutes to set up. If you&#039;re happy with the result, then you&#039;re done and you can go back to running the cafe. If it doesn&#039;t do the trick, you&#039;ll have more information about the traffic, and can use more complicated setting like the one proposed by Villeneuve.</p><p>Please report back - we&#039;d love to hear how it functions for you.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your responses, friends. Villeneuve&#039;s configuration does not works as latest kernel version is not supported for cake&#039;s dependency (kmod-sched-fq_pie). I had compiler problems while trying to integrate cake into my firmware...</p><p>richbhanover, the default settings are working just fine. I have tested 5 devices so far. 2 Devices were downloading big game same time with max speed (downloader) and other wifi clients were watching Youtube videos at same time. No lag, no freezes, no buffering stucks. Everything works just fine.

					<p>SQM works great but you should fine tune download and upload speeds. These adjustmens are very sensitive. If set too high, no SQM effect. If set too low, your overall internet speed gets limited.</p>									</div>
