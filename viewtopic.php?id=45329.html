					<p>Hey. I would like to configure a network with 2 routers:</p><br /><p>Internet &lt;----- &gt; WAN&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ROUTER 1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LAN + WiFi&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt; ----- &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; WAN&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ROUTER 2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LAN + WiFi<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (non-openwrt router with DHCP server)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(OpenWrt router with second DHCP server)</p><p>I need this configuration because I would like to configure a Proxy client on OpenWrt router (this is not a problem and it&#039;s easy to do) and make all devices connecting to OpenWrt connect through Proxy (I would like to watch BBC on-line :-D I&#039;m not from UK )<br />First router is some router without openwrt on it and it should be used for default internet connection. I can&#039;t do much on first router so I would like to know how to configure OpenWrt router. It must recieve IP address from first router DHCP and then provide another pool of IP addresses for devices connecting to it. Of course all devices in network must be able to connect to Internet (Proxy or non-Proxy).</p><p>This configuration is not for me so I would like it to be fully automatic, just connect to first router and set WiFi settings, I don&#039;t want any static configuration because I would have to update it everytime first router changes and has different configuration.</p><p>Thank you for your help :-)</p><p>I&#039;m starting my vacations tomorrow so I won&#039;t be able to test the configuration until end of next week but I&#039;ll be watching this post from time to time :-D</p><p>Thank you once again :-)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mesiu84</strong> on 18 Jul 2013, 23:41)</p>
