					<p>I know it´s not very constructive in the openwrt development but quiet some ppl are still looking in the matter of changing the APN, for example i was surprised that it wasn´t possible even if you want to use web.vodafone.de which is still vodafone...<br />i don´t see a pm function but saw that there is a firmware mod kit and would like to know if it´s possible to just change the apn with that easily, in the long run openwrt would be perfect.</p><p>thx</p><p>Yaku</p>									</div>

					<p>I was trying to bypass uboot password by changing some uboot env values. I saw in source code that uboot checks for preboot env which is not defined by vodafone. So while i had access to ssh on the router i used uboot_env and added something like &quot;preboot=myenv&quot; and &quot;myenv=help&quot;. What this does is it runs anything that is defined in preboot env before anything, before delay and password prompt. But i added &quot;loady&quot; as preboot command so my boot was stoped at that point and i could not boot kernel. That is not the problem anymore, as i said i recompiled new uboot that dont check preboot env and sent it in UART mode, it booted vodavone fw and i used uboot_env to clear preboot. Now i am ok, with all back to stock.</p><p>I want to say that preboot comes in handy here, one can use say loady to reflash bootloader or kernel from stock bootloader without need for a uboot password, but since we have source code it is better just to recompile and enhance uboot. I dont know why is uboot for this device so huge, almost twice as big as for infinion/danube devices. .asc file is 478Kb and it takes more than 5 minutes to upload it over UART.</p><p>EDIT:<br />Just to be clear, now with access to UART mode and working uboot.asc file device is almost unbrickable. Just be sure to have backup of all partitions before trying anything.</p><p>Also, can someone with LTE version confirm if UART is activated the same way as on xDSL version (shortcut R148 while powering the device)?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>angrybb</strong> on 29 Jan 2015, 13:13)</p>

					<p>Interesting story, i also asked this question myself:&quot;How those people find those &quot;hidden&quot; triggers for various modes? Especially when there is no datasheets and other docs. Maybe by trial and error?&quot;<br />So i startet first by googling for this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ROM VER: 1.1.4 CFG 06</code></pre></div><p>And having a bit of experiance with another arcasyan router, arv4518pw i knew that CFG 06 part should be 01,02,03,04... So i googled for that and came across <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/arcadyan/arv7519#bootstrapuart_mode">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/arcadyan/ar … puart_mode</a> and interesting enough those two resistors are missing on 904 xdsl too. The difference is that on 904 xdsl uart is activated just by shortcuting R148 and by shortcuting R148 and R155 we got some other mode but i dont remember which CFG is that.</p><p>Here is the picture with marked pins<br /><a href="http://imgur.com/V9iwIDE"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/V9iwIDEs.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/V9iwIDEs.jpg" /></span></a></p><p>One small info also, you can detach display board while messing with bootloader, router will function normaly.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>angrybb</strong> on 29 Jan 2015, 22:44)</p>

					<p>@BigDee you may look at uboot env here - <a href="http://pastebin.com/AyHujYsm">http://pastebin.com/AyHujYsm</a><br />you can see that in order to flash u-boot only you need to &quot;run update_uboot from&quot; u-boot comand line, which is not possible from stock bootloader without password. You maybe can set preboot to &quot;run update_uboot&quot; but i am not sure if this will work. Will try later if i have time.</p>									</div>

					<p>@BigDee<br />I think u-boot is not part of fw package. With binwalk i see only squashfs rootfs image and kernel. I know on older arcadyan models one could build u-boot as 2nd stage bootloader and replace kernel in fw with that u-boot but i dont see that uboot compiled with this sources.<br />That on pastebin is the default u-boot env, but here is the dd dump of my mtd6 (uboot configuration partition, removed SN, MAC and WPA Key, please correct that first with hex editor before trying anything) - <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/?zqk28brd2t8m688">https://www.mediafire.com/?zqk28brd2t8m688</a></p><p>EDIT:<br />I checked uboot from <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/?pmnq0y8x1ixr1pk">https://www.mediafire.com/?pmnq0y8x1ixr1pk</a> and it is working. Accepts any password (Thx @Morpheu5!) and lan is working. I used tftp to reflash u-boot.lq from zip and now i have permanent &quot;custom&quot; uboot on flash.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>angrybb</strong> on 13 Feb 2015, 19:50)</p>

					<p>Hi, I have a 904 xDSL router HW: R01 and FW: AT904X-MFR.01: t16. I have not had contact with firmware for routers but now I have to unlock this router because I need to access the internet via 3g sim card. There are currently firmware version AT904X-02.05 (Linux 2.6.32.32 # 2 Sun May 3 11:21:02 CST 2013) and have U-Boot 2010.06-Lv2.0.40-A0.5 (Nov 22 2012 - 15:40:12).</p><p>After reading this thread I try to find 3.10 firmware but can find it anywhere. Angrybb state that there is usable uboot but I realy dont know what that realy means. If someone can give me instruction it will be great. Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>@angrybb For my understanding, you need the UART mode to flash the boot loader with TFTP?</p>									</div>

					<p>@Pera.Kojot.Supergenije<br />I think you will have to enable telnet/ssh acces to router first and then use ccfg_cli to manualy edit config options. I dont think there is &quot;unlocked&quot; web gui yet avaliable. take a look here for more info <a href="https://piratenpad.de/p/GWryBbvQqV">https://piratenpad.de/p/GWryBbvQqV</a></p><p>@BigDee<br />No. UART mode is almost as JTAG in this case. Routers CPU write everything you send to it over serial(UART) port directly to RAM and then execute it. In this case you need u-boot.asc file, content from that file to be more accurate. So you are then running &quot;live&quot; uboot. If you dont write anything to flash memory, after reset all is back as before uart mode.<br />But in this &quot;live&quot; uboot you can flash anything over tftp, just use the right command.</p><p>I will try to dump my unlocked bootloader from ssh in vodafone fw and then write it back, all using dd command. If that works than all what you need to reflash uboot is ssh acces to the router and good u-boot file.</p>									</div>

					<p>@angrybb Many thanks for your fast reply. But my box is bricked and won&#039;t boot. It show a kernel panic and run into a boot loop. I made some changes at the kernel boot parameter.</p>									</div>

					<p>@BigDee<br />Then you must enable UART mode and correct that. And when you are doing so, it is better to reflash modified &quot;nopasswd&quot; uboot so you dont have to open the router case anymore.</p>									</div>
