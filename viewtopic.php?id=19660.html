					<p>I have a Linksys WRT54GL v1.1 that is currently running Victecs modified Tomato 1.23 firmware. It works well but has tempted me with what can be done with this router. The firmware is *almost* capable of everything I want it to do but getting help doing that is really hard on the forums. </p><p>Anyways after thinking about it openWRT&#039;s solution sounds alot better, install the packages you want instead of waiting for the author to add the functionality. Here is what I&#039;d like to do with my router:</p><p>-QoS functionality - for magicjack VOIP and my gaming.<br />-Per-IP bandwidth monitoring - so I can figure out who is using the net and killing my ping in game.<br />-Have an easy way to temporarily kick/throttle users bandwidth so I can resume gaming.</p><p>-I Dont need wireless access since I have another router handling that.</p><p>I am not familiar with the various WRT&#039;s (DD, Open etc), can anyone advise me which would work best for me? </p><p>I know victecs tomato has QoS (very easy to set up too). Per ip you have to enable imq&#039;s tel-net into the router, sometimes they dont stick to assigned hosts and when the router reboots they are all lost. It&#039;s a mess and hard to get support on as its not a very important feature to victec. The kicking/throttling thing I&#039;ve seen on tomato with some advanced scripting but that was for more permanent throttling and the configuration generator script site went down a long time ago. It also wouldn&#039;t be convenient for quick logging in and enabling throttles that only need to last a few hours.</p>									</div>
