					<p>I am looking for a very small Linux distribution that could be ported to a legacy network device, but it&#039;s not a router, and it&#039;s not running Linux.&nbsp; I am trying to understand if OpenWRT is a possible option.&nbsp; So, here is some basic information, and maybe you can help me.&nbsp; I already read this page <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/add.new.platform">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/add.new.platform</a> and searched the forums, but I didn&#039;t find the answer myself yet.&nbsp; Thank you for any insights you can provide.</p><p>The legacy network device has a big-endian ARM 9 processor, 32 MB SDRAM, 16 MB Flash.&nbsp; I know it has several GPIO, and it supports a wired Ethernet connection and multiple serial ports.&nbsp; There is no video or USB hardware on the board.&nbsp; I have access to all hardware specifications, most original source code, J-TAG, and a working compiler.&nbsp; I am experienced at using the J-TAG to debug applications on the target, but not at using it to find problems with the OS and hardware (yet).</p><p>Can OpenWRT possibly be an option?&nbsp; If not, why not?</p>									</div>
