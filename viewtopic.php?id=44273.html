					<p>Hi, I have successfully installed a COM interface on my TL-WR1043ND. I am sure it is working since I can see the router booting and I can enter and use the serial console, so no problem here.<br />Now I want to use the COM interface for a smartmouse reader (with a COM interface, no USB). I previously used this exact smartmouse with a program, now ported on OpenWrt with the same exact configuration.<br />For some reason it does not work, maybe do I need some particular kernel module to use the COM from the router?<br />I also checked the COM settings with &quot;stty &lt; /dev/ttyS0&quot;, which returns the same exact output of my PC.</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>liquidator87</strong> on 17 May 2013, 22:37)</p>

					<p>You probably need to free the serial port first. See this post: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=186932#p186932">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 32#p186932</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Then the kernel is still using that serial port for its log-messages. You could install minicom and run a test with it (while causing events that appear in the log, like connecting usb devices).</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah it seems so... In fact, I can still see the log while the router is booting, but now I can&#039;t enter the serial console...</p><p>I would like to build an image without the logging of the kernel.

					<p>I am totally unexperienced with the Imagebuilder, but from what I understand, it just repacks ready-built packages into a new image. So, I am not sure if it touches the kernel. And there is still the kernel command line of uboot, which I don&#039;t know if it is respected or ignored by the kernel, but it would be worth a try to change it.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve recompiled the kernel without these two options:<br />- &quot;Console on 8250/16550 and compatible serial port&quot;<br />- &quot;Console on AR933X serial port&quot;</p><p>Removed &quot;console=/dev/ttyS0,115200&quot; from the kernel command line, commented the line in /etc/inittab and modified the log levels in /etc/config/system as suggested. Now I can see the Uboot log but not the kernel log.</p><p>However, the problem is still there, I&#039;m unable to use the COM port with my program. Also tried with microcom and says &quot;/dev/ttyS0 not responding&quot;, is it normal?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>liquidator87</strong> on 19 May 2013, 20:36)</p>
