					<p>Hello,</p><p>with openwrt kamikaze 7 I had a problem: I was not able to forward udp protocol (so I had to configure openvpn to use tcp).</p><p>With kamikaze 8.09 udp was working, but now it has stopped working and I am now forced to put again openvpn to tcp mode.</p><p>I have not changed the configuration so I do not understand what happens.</p><p>Can you help me?</p><p>Thanks in advance for any reply.</p><br /><p>Mario</p>									</div>

					<p>Sigh, it seems my bug, I had it also on 7.09 with wrt54gl and now with 8.09 with asus500 premium. </p><p>In my case it seems that it was ok for two weeks but then I have done two things:</p><p>- installed/removed some packages, x-wrt luci etc.<br />- started on a pc&nbsp; mldonkey that uses a lot udp.</p><p>After these two &quot;uncommon&quot; activities I started seeing openvpn not working and I had to switch back to tcp.</p><p>Mario</p>									</div>
