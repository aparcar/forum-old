					<p>My question is all about how I might set up this openWrt so that I can get faster speeds of internet connect/service, fiber and have done alright with the 1500/384 package as subscribed but when I heard about this method of possibly connecting another modem to my Uverse modem, I am interested if it can maybe do the job of increasing my speed, etc...<br />First off, I have a 2 wire router that I bought for the prior isp (dsl) and wondered if that could be the second modem needed or if it can handle fiber connection because it is mandatory for the ISP service, to rent their Uverse modem as part of the deal. <br />So, if this is information that anyone can provide or assist in, I appreciate it. <br />I don&#039;t know how to even--or this process is all new so, I&#039;m basic starting up and it&#039;s not a matter of wham bam, accordingly or I&#039;ve read some of the link that I was given in one of the forums where we do our speed tests, but it was so fast and furious I couldn&#039;t even gather the steps the guys talking about and c7 archer and all this, kind of requires for me anyway, step by step if anyone has any references they can forward, I appreciate it!</p><p>Thanks,<br />leis</p>									</div>

					<p>If you&#039;re hoping to get higher speeds than you&#039;re paying for, that&#039;s not going to happen. If you are using an older router that is causing a bottleneck, that might help. OpenWrt supports a few routers with integrated DSL modems as well as standalone routers that would rely on a separate modem. The support for the integrated devices (with a modem working under OpenWrt) is limited to Lantiq-based devices, and going this route offers a few advantages performance-wise, but severely limits your hardware options.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve learned a little bit since I put up this thread and I&#039;m not real sure, but I take it that the uVerse At&amp;t modem is that of Dsl (device) which it was suggested to get the router such as C7 Archer (the latest one) and that kind of router would be compatible with the Openwrt and I would improve speeds and tests, that while I test higher than the subscribed ISP service of 1500 kbps/384, I still show bufferbloat and score overall D and F as far as speed on Dslreports. <br />So, it&#039;s the line, than that&#039;s one thing but still yet, as Dsl reports said, for the 1500/384 that&#039;s not really too good for 2015, just to have fiber service and therefore, that&#039;s why it was suggested by tech at ISP to try this method and I would improve overall tests and noticeable difference. And so, that&#039;s my pursuit or if I did get this router to use with the Uverse is method that seems to work for others, but it is kind of lopsided way to process, I mean, in order to what-get a better bang and quality out of having internet connection. But I&#039;m just learning, so, this is a little deep for me, anyway.</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenWrt will help you with bufferbloat if configured correctly, regardless of whether you are using an integrated modem/router or just a router connected to an external modem. There are some small advantages to the integrated device, but selection is more limited as I mentioned before.</p>									</div>

					<p>Drawz, Thanks for the info and I appreciate the time in taking to it, and I have kind of drawn the scratch it idea because as the dslreports guy indicated, just about the same as you have explained and that if max or it could be performance increase of 10% if even, and likely the ISP has a set connection rate regardless, and wouldn&#039;t likely matter much of what kind of device added on, etc...and that kind of gives off a different feeling to look into this and may be it works for certain guys that have gone this route but I haven&#039;t seen too many on our forum for Isp as mentioned, dslreports. The other thing about my annual contract with the dslextreme in Oct. I have asked about possible deal of subscribing to the next level up of 3.0 from the present 1500/384. That&#039;s about the lowest of the subscriptions too <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> hmm.<br />Meanwhile, I&#039;ll like to learn more about what you guys do and what is your specialty?</p><p>Later,<br />leis</p>									</div>
