					<p>Hi,</p><p>I resubmitted the patch for this device because a lot of people asked for it. But it looks like the development of OpenWRT is stalled for some time - so I&#039;ll leave the firmware binaries here until it has been integrated. There&#039;s an image with and one without LuCI in case you need more space for additional packages. This is the current trunk (Designated Driver) from 04-04-2016. It&#039;s not completely tested so your device might catch fire.</p><p>WR802N image with LuCI: <a href="https://github.com/RickP/OpenWRT-for-WR802N/raw/master/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr802n-squashfs-factory.bin">https://github.com/RickP/OpenWRT-for-WR … actory.bin</a></p><p>WR802N image without LuCI:&nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/RickP/OpenWRT-for-WR802N/raw/master/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr802n-squashfs-factory-no_luci.bin">https://github.com/RickP/OpenWRT-for-WR … o_luci.bin</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rickp</strong> on 4 May 2016, 21:46)</p>

					<p>I used the WR802N image with LuCI. I was able to flash the device through the GUI. Once flashed, the LED switches on for a second at every boot-up and then remains off. Everything else appeared to be working fine. Unfortunately I misconfigured one of the network interfaces, leaving me unable to login to access the device via SSH or the web interface. No luck getting the device into failsafe mode either, despite repeatedly clicking the reset button throughout boot-up. Unfortunately it looks like I might have to bin it now :-(</p><p>UPDATE: I managed fix the network configuration by logging into SSH using the device&#039;s ipv6 address. It turns out that I had two interfaces using the same ipv4 address. All is working as it should now :-)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>blacksmith</strong> on 16 Jul 2016, 18:47)</p>

					<p>Hi,<br />just wanted to report that i successfully used both the images on my WR802N.<br />Tho i had to install BOTH of them via the legacy-firmware&#039;s web-frontend, installing via commandline from within a working openWrt did not work and i nearly bricked my device this way.<br />But i was able to recover the device using the TFTP method - but strangely this worked only with the legacy-firmware image, an attempt to install one of the openwrt images via TFTP failed.</p><p>As i want a VPN server on the device i tried to install the openvpn package, which failed because of the really tight free space, so my plan now is to create an image myself with LuCI and the openvpn-package installed, but without LuCI for saving space. It COULD work, but i have to try it to be sure.<br />It could take some days/weeks as i dont have much spare time for this, but i will keep you updated and eventually post the image here when it&#039;s done.</p><p>As i am completely new to building openwrt myself i would appreciate any help or hints on which packages i should include and in general if there are any traps in the process.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gelse</strong> on 5 Aug 2016, 09:55)</p>

					<p>Hello everybody!</p><p>I also use this really great Travel-Router (v1) and I&#039;m interested in OpenWrt. The original software of the TP-Link WR802N unfortunately obviously links the SSID via the BSSID to the MAC address of the respective HotSpot. Without BSSID, no connection can be configured.<br />Is this restriction also with one of the two OpenWrt firmware presented here?</p><p>With the original firmware, no networks / WISP access profiles can be stored. You must restart the setup for each hotspot / access point.<br />Can be stored with the OpenWrt firmware several networks / WISP access profiles in the TP WR802n?</p><p>Thank you very much for your info and help</p><p>Pauline</p><p>######################################################################################</p><p>Hallo Zusammen!</p><p>Ich nutze auch diesen richtig tollen Travel-Router (v1) und interessiere mich für OpenWrt.
