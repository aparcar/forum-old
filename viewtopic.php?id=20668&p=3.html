					<p>With a recent build, OpenWrt Kamikaze 18767, I now have the fastest wireless I have ever tested. My laptop is connecting to the RS Pro&#039;s Sparklan WMIA-199 Atheros 3x3 11abgn card showing only 130mbps connection speed, but I&#039;m getting 17mbps on the wugnet.com speed test. That is by far the fastest wireless connection I&#039;ve ever achieved. That&#039;s faster than the Asus WL500W, Routerboard RB493 with a Mikrotic R52n card, and Netlink WNR850T 11n routers with their factory firmware. It&#039;s also faster than the 5 or 6 11g and 11a routers I have tested. Until this recent build I was only getting 11g connection speed so I guess progress is being made with ath9k.</p><p>Here&#039;s my wireless config file:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;wifi-device&#039; &#039;wifi0&#039;

					<p>so what&#039;s wrong with the kamikazee image pre-installed on the RSPro? i&#039;m a little new to openwrt but when i got a nanostation2 and flashed it with openwrt i knew this was the way to do. but the RSPro doesn&#039;t have a gui installed. why not even luci like the ns2 image? so i did get into it and was able to configure it to get on the net but opkg upgrades break (had to edit opkg.conf to do an update) nor will it let me install software. do i need to build a replacement image (robrob can you post?) or should i find a netshe or pycl image? why these over luci? i&#039;m so disappointed with ubiquiti now. why even bother to install an image on the thing if it&#039;s mean to be wiped when you get it?</p>									</div>

					<p>have a RS working with two R52n cards, in my case one as AP and one as STA. But mode choice is free. Make sure their RF signals do not interfere, i.e. at 2.4 GHz at least 5 channels difference.<br />At 5 GHz the STA sees the AP with a -25 dBm super strong signal even though coaxial pigtails are used to connect to the miniPCI radios and the antennas are directionals pointing in different directions from one mast.<br />As the boards will operate independently and thus asynchronous in their RX /TX multiplexing (alernation in time between receiving and transmitting) they are potential noise sources to each other. And the use of the word &#039; channel&#039;&nbsp; is misleading. It is more to be understood as a centre frequency as the signals are much wider than the channel spacing is.</p><p>This particular radio card that I use has the atheros ar9220 IC and needs the ath9k driver. Do not know whether the regular &#039; wifi&#039; script of OpenWrt deals well with multiple radio cards. I am using my own script that replaces &#039;wifi&#039; because ath9k needed some debugging. It uses wpa_supplicant&#039;s feature of having one&nbsp; wpa_supplicant-global process and multiple wpa_supplicant instances and uses the command line interface of wpa_supplicant to do the settings needed for WPA. So one RS(pro) can accomodate three miniPCI stations and per USB even more radios ! So perhaps it works out of the box but in any case can be made to work</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>doddel</strong> on 18 Dec 2009, 21:08)</p>

					<p>doddel, what web management interface are you using? what .bin did you install (if not the pre-loaded one)? also was the ath9k driver in the .bin you used or did you have to compile it? i&#039;ve got an R52n card too and the pre-loaded kamikazee won&#039;t see it.</p><p>in general i do need to decide what gui to use. right now i&#039;m most interested in having good firewall management tools and also being able to create VLANs.</p>									</div>

					<p>@stel:<br />1) I manage the system per linux command line so cannot advise you on a web management interface<br />2) .bin produced by cross-compile toolchain: svn checkout of OpenWrt trunk with recent version of compat-wireless package</p><p>If you do not want to get involved with linux and compiling things I would recommend using Dec. 2009 snapshot images from downloads.openwrt.org as those will contain many fixes needed for good R52n operation. OpenWrt gets the ath9k drivers from the mac80211 package which in turn gets them from the compat-wireless package. The drivers went through a lot of debugging in recent months (see wireless.kernel.org).</p><p>3) vlan: have a RS and for that have not seen vlan support yet. You just get eth0 (single wan PoE port) and eth1 (two lan ports).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>doddel</strong> on 25 Dec 2009, 13:49)</p>

					<p>yeah i&#039;m not afraid to complile, just lazyi guess. i&#039;ve been linux for 15 years (not heavy - too much of a tech business man unfortunately but i play tech at home) and always used to compile my kernels but it&#039;s so much nicer to get binaries. see and you say R52n support is in there now! i want to do VLANs because i make my access points public and would like to make them show up as 2 APs, one that gets you on the net and one that gets you on my LAN (+net). i can worry about that later.</p><p>bad thing is i think i bricked my RSPro after some decent success last night. got some sleep and am back on it but any advice would be appreciated.</p><p>so can anyone give me some votes on web interfaces? i date back to all cli all the time but something i&#039;m not in every day i really think a gui is better for. plus the learning curve is shorter. when you really know the cli it&#039;s all faster but there&#039;s that hump. anyway i have luci on my ns2 and will default to that unless i find it has weak firewall tools or someone tells me otherwise.</p>									</div>

					<p>damn that was harder than it sounded. you have to catch it at the right time with the reset button. best to let your computer keep pinging 192.168.1.20 while you&#039;re trying to get reset at the right time. then you continue with tftp.</p>									</div>

					<p>finally got luci running. fyi there&#039;s a recent bug but an update and install of luci-admin-full and luci-fastindex does the trick. btw dmesg shows vlan support (RS Pro) and luci has config screens for it. there are some details in the main openwrt docs too that might apple. i haven&#039;t tried it yet. next order of business is to get this R52n card working. installed kmod-mac80211 and kmod-lib80211 but still ifconfig -a shows no wifi interface only br-lan, eth0, eth1, and lo. what next?</p>									</div>

					<p>nevermind. looks like i also needed to install kmod-ath9k, ath, mac80211-hwsim. methinks opkg needs better dependency mgmt or maybe the pkg maintainer for ath9k needs some love.</p>									</div>
