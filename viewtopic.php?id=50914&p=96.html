					<p>@Arokh, thanks anyway!. I&#039;ll try to figure it out. thanks for your help!</p><p>I do have an issue related to your build, i really don&#039;t know when it started since I was using a previous build (maybe a couple of months old) and started happening in the last 5 or 6 builds. My wan (pppoe) interface just stops working (no packages send/receive) but the uptime counter keeps running. Of course I have no internet inside lan after that. Disabling and enabling again the interface doesn&#039;t fix it, only router reboot is able to get connection back. Happened with a fresh flashed too. </p><p>How can I help you to debug this? Anybody else experiencing something like this?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>@plop</p><p>Although I&#039;m sure there are cases where connecting a USB soundcard and getting Airplay through your router is useful, I don&#039;t think that&#039;s a common case and worthwile including in the default package set. shairport-sync depends on libavahi-client, alsa-lib, libdaemon, and more which would increase the size of the image. I do build the kernel modules you mentioned, so you can easily install everything you need.</p><p>@erikoo</p><p>Nice, thanks for confirming <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile"/></p>									</div>

					<p>I am a long time user of your build for Netgear WNDR3700v1. It works great.<br/>Do you have any plans to make your build available for TP-Link WDR3600/4300. I guess I can&#039;t use your 4900 build as it is larger than 8MB...</p>									</div>
