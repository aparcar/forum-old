You can now download package via the software tab with openwrt using LuCI. </p><p>Once you have downloaded the packages you need, you can then go on and configure openwrt further via LuCI.</p><p>Hope this helps.</p><p>Anyhow, as soon as my usb to ttl adapter is delivered, i will be unbricking my bricked mr3040 via serial and i will post how i got on etc <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>des245</strong> on 17 Apr 2013, 01:13)</p>
