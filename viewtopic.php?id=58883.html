					<p>No.&nbsp; Due to the Broadcom chipset licensing restrictions, it is not.&nbsp; return it.<br />The C7 ver 2.0 is exactly the same as the C5 ver 1.0 so that is fine just sells for more....</p><p>BTW I hope everyone knows that the FCC is trying to eliminate 3rd party software for Routers.&nbsp; This needs to be stopped.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have one as well, but it looks like we&#039;d need to figure out lots of stuff.<br />1. I don&#039;t think all of the code is available on the TP-Link site, look at the size difference in the v1 and v2 files.<br />2. If it is missing code, there would have to be a request to TP-Link to get the rest of the code.<br />3. I can download and try to compile the binaries, but that might not be of much use. I&#039;m not experienced with developing for OpenWrt, so somebody would have to say what the next steps are.</p>									</div>
