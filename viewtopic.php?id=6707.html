					<p>Hi!</p><p>I am entirely new to OpenWrt, but I hope I read the docs correctly.</p><p>Next to me I have a brand new ASUS WL-500g Premium. I bought that device because of the larger memory.</p><p>Now I am trying to get OpenWrt onto it. In the Wiki (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Asus/WL500GP">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har â€¦ us/WL500GP</a>) it says that the openwrt-brcm-2.4-jffs2-4MB.trx image should work fine on that router, but I cannot upload it through the router&#039;s original web interface. It just get&#039;s refused.</p><p>Well, I understand I should use a .bin file to upload it through the web interface. But I cannot find a .bin image for the ASUS WL-500g anywhere. As a .bin is nothing but a .trx plus some headers I might be able to create a .bin myself, but what info would I have to put into the headers and what tool should I use?</p><p>I was also thinking about the TFTP method, but I understand even then I should use a .bin instead of a .trx image? And even if this is wrong and I could upload a .trx image using TFTP, I did not manage to TFTP to the router.</p><p>Any directions would be welcome. Am I getting the concept wrong?</p><p>Regards,<br />Torsten</p>									</div>
