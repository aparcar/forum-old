					<p>I&#039;ve been running an SVN version of Kamikaze on a D-Link DIR-615 (hardware revision C1) for a month or two and I decided to pop the cover off to take a look at what&#039;s inside today.</p><p>It appears that the D-link DIR-615 rev C1 has a place for a USB port, various components for the power supply to be soldered, and two spots that look like they need to be bridged for the USB data pins, but they are all unpopulated. There&#039;s even a cutout in the plastic for it, so no dremeling would be required, one would only need to cut a hole in the sticker covering the back with an x-acto knife.</p><p>I have a few questions, though...</p><p>1) Has anyone else noticed this?</p><p>2) How hard would it be to get the USB port hooked up and working? This router runs off of a 5 volt power supply, unlike most that use 12 volts, so I&#039;m thinking that the power supply circuit doesn&#039;t need to be too complicated.</p><p>3) How hard would it be software-wise to support this USB port?&nbsp; Do other routers based on the ar71xx/ath9k chipset have USB ports already? If so, does OpenWrt Kamikaze support the USB port on those routers?</p><p>I think USB would be very useful on this router because it has only 4MB of flash even though it has 32MB of RAM.&nbsp; (!) It would be possible to stick extra stuff on a flash drive that won&#039;t fit. (4MB is too small for a useful jffs2 partition.)</p><p>If I decide to try to hook up USB on this router, I&#039;ll post my results (including pictures) for anyone else who is interested in this.</p><p>Here are some pictures of what I&#039;m talking about:</p><p><a href="http://img10.imageshack.us/my.php?image=photo0edited.jpg"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://img10.imageshack.us/img10/6231/photo0edited.th.jpg" alt="http://img10.imageshack.us/img10/6231/photo0edited.th.jpg" /></span></a><br /><a href="http://img14.imageshack.us/my.php?image=photo1zzz.jpg"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://img14.imageshack.us/img14/3021/photo1zzz.th.jpg" alt="http://img14.imageshack.us/img14/3021/photo1zzz.th.jpg" /></span></a></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi there,</p><p>I&#039;m also interested in this. I have the DIR-615 C2 hardware revision and will have a look on the circuit. I guess the first step will be to check out whether the lines are connected to the chip, by testing resistance to ground with a multimeter.</p><p>If the lines are connected, what is the story with the driver? I&#039;m a familiar openwrt user but how do I go about finding what driver I need, and would the kernel need to be recompiled or something? How does the kernel know the pin outs etc?</p>									</div>

					<p>The connector placeholder on the PCB doesn&#039;t look like any USB connector I&#039;ve seen. Judging from the width it&#039;s an upright connector but most upright USB connectors look like this.</p><p><a href="http://parts.digikey.com/1/parts/1644561-conn-rcpt-usb-4pos-upright-pcb-67329-8001.html">http://parts.digikey.com/1/parts/164456 … -8001.html</a></p><p>Also judging from the traces on the PCB the top bottom are connected to the GND and the middle 2 are connected to something else (but seemingly both the same signal). It could be a3.5mm jack, a power connector or maybe an coax connector for an external antenna. The missing parts to the left of the first image are for an elco, a coil/transformer and I think maybe a fuse. This all combined leads me to believe the missing parts are for a different type of power supply which was discarded with newer versions.</p><p>Can you read the silkscreen (white letters) next to the missing components and let us the designation to maybe we can make more sense of what&#039;s supposed to be there.</p>									</div>

					<p>Did you use 22 ohm resistors at R230 and R237?<br />Did you use 15K pull down resistors on both signal lines (D+ and D-)?<br />Did you supply 5v to USB pin 1?&nbsp; If so how?</p><p>No one has ever confirmed that this mod actually works... it&#039;s all just speculation right now.&nbsp; It looks like lexxai didn&#039;t get it working (correct me if I&#039;m wrong).</p><p>Here&#039;s a few things I would try:<br />1.

I think the USB 2.0 Specification was modified to allow different values for the pull-down resistors (14.25K - 24.80K).&nbsp; You may want to experiment with different values.&nbsp; See here: <a href="http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/usb_20_081810.zip">http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/usb_20_081810.zip</a><br />3. Trace the signal lines (D+ an D-) back to the chip (past R230 and R237) and make sure they are actually connected.&nbsp; They may be grounded out (because they weren&#039;t be used).</p><p>Hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck, and please post your results.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think the USB bus should be recognized simply by installing the correct kernel modules/drivers, regardless of whether or not a device is connected (or what pull-down resistors are used).&nbsp; Therefore, you should see &quot;new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 1&quot; and &quot;USB 2.0 started, EHCI 1.00&quot; in dmesg after the USB 2.0 driver is loaded (without any USB device connected).&nbsp; I don&#039;t know why it&#039;s not working.</p><p>The only thing I can think of is if the signal lines are pulled to ground, then maybe the USB host is not recognized?&nbsp; Can you confirm that the signal lines are actually connected to the AR9130 (i.e. the pads at R230 and R237 should be connected to the respective pinouts of the AR9130)?&nbsp; It&#039;s possible that the signal line traces are broken further down the line and not actually connected to the chip... and the respective pins on the chip are pulled to ground.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have a DIR-615 C1/C2 board, so I can&#039;t check myself.</p><p>Also, what build are you using?&nbsp; What packages do you have installed?</p><p>The AR9130 has USB 2.0 host support, so this mod should be possible.</p>									</div>

But no success. After that I checked voltage without flashdrive and got 3.3V on D- and 0.4V on D+... Looks like D- is not pulled-down. Also I found empty resistor pads for R2 near main chip but haven&#039;t time to check if this is USB D- pull-down resistor. I&#039;ll try to check today.</p><p>Looks like USB host is working and data lines connected....</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>regressor</strong> on 30 Sep 2010, 03:30)</p>
