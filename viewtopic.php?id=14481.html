					<p>I have always been interested in tweaking WLAN speed and reliability. Now I found a very good helper to measuring these: iperf.</p><p>Iperf is a small command line tool available to many platforms, also to Linux, and I installed it to Meraki with OpenWrt succeeded with no problems at all.</p><p>Iperf normally needs two computers, server and client, but by installing Iperf to my AP I get a really nice setup for measuring how my WLAN works.</p><p>There is instructions about the settings of iperf in <a href="http://speedtest.fi">http://speedtest.fi</a> . There is a huge bunch of different possibilities, TCP, UDP, own files etc. all showing speed, latency, dropped packets. I was really happy to find this tool, so I recommend it to anybody interested in measuring connection capabilities.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>anttu</strong> on 12 Feb 2008, 08:39)</p>
