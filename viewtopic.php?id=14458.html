					<p>I use a wgt634u&nbsp; running kamikaze (2.6.23) as music player. works fine so far, only i have a considerable amount of musepack (.mpc) files which aren&#039;t supported by mpd. i know there&#039;s libmpcdec, but i couldn&#039;t figure out how to make mpd use it.<br />is there another way besides recompiling mpd? <br />if no: has anyone maybe already built such a package? i&#039;m really not very experienced in cross-compiling...</p><p>thanks a lot for any help!</p>									</div>
