					<p>dlang,</p><p>Luci calls the sysupgrade binary, but without -f. The &quot;bug&quot; is in the sysupgrade code, though could be addressed in Luci asking like OEM firmware if you still want to force an update and then adding -f to the command line. Bugs like this happen but if reported it should be a high priority item. Being able to flash back to OEM is probably the most important feature of third party firmwares. It was reported 5-6 months ago. What is holding up progress?</p>									</div>

					<p>tapper</p><p>There is this sysupgrade bug which mishandles *factory.img. Should have sent you the *sysupgrade.tar, though that one can&#039;t be flashed from OEM. Besides CC obviously LEDE wasn&#039;t fixed either. It&#039;s a pure coincidence that it&#039;s working in CC / LEDE. One of the more ugly kernel hacks (which I obviously dropped) allows to recover from a broken upgrade and so this got hidden away. LEDE was told off on this EOF marker hack by upstream, along the lines of &quot;If you change the on-disk format keep all bugs for yourself, we won&#039;t care&quot;.</p><p>To sum up, *factory.img can be flashed from swrt,&nbsp; OEM or via tftp / usb, otherwise use the *sysupgrade.tar. Glad you could install Villeneuves builds, they probably also come with all common packages already installed.</p><p>Sorry</p>									</div>

					<p>lifehacksback, gsustek</p><p>The secret might just be time, if you do something for two decades as a hobby you are prone to get better at it. As for OpenWrt specifically, the buildroot was neglected quite a bit. Besides pointless stuff / ugly hacks there is a huge lack of documentation making for a high entry barrier. As I already was familiar with far more elaborate package management setups and related topics it certainly was a lot easier to figure what the single bits are supposed to do or what to look out for when needing a specific feature.</p><p>Another aspect is being familiar with unix tools, being able to read Makefiles like prose. Knowing plenty of programming languages, having read millions of lines of code by others and other things along this line probably play their role as well.</p><p>The above holds true for everyone. More personal, having the world view of a physicist and a better than average memory paired with an unwillingness to throw in the towel fast are aspects that I would list as helping get started as well.</p><p>For learning to code, write an app with 100&#039;000+ lines of code, only then architecturing starts to play an important role, working out those issues will be an invaluable foundation for any such activity. Also don&#039;t stick to OpenWrt solely, there are plenty other distributions / OSes worth looking into as well, most _documented_ well. Get familiar with one of those first, it might be a lot easier.</p>									</div>

					<p>hnk,</p><p>thanks for reporting back.</p><p>Upstream (hostapd) default is 0, so you should have to override it with &quot;option skip_inactivity_poll 1&quot; in your /etc/config/wireless for it to make it into hostapd.conf. If disabled the option won&#039;t be printed to hostapd.conf at all. Changing the default would break this &quot;promise&quot;. Maybe I just misunderstood you.</p>									</div>

					<p>doITright, tapper</p><p>looks like a new regression with ubifs in linux-next. Only the squashfs with overlay based images are affected. Will look into it, till then you can use the non squashfs based images or an older kernel.</p><p>Thanks for the report.</p>									</div>
