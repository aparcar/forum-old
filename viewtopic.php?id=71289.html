					<p>Hi guys, i am hoping someone can assist me as this is driving me crazy.</p><p>So i have purchased an R9000 to replace my existing R7000 that is running DD-WRT. The port configuration i want to migrate dictates that i need to create a virtual interface and assign a VLAN id of 2 to a port UNTAGGED.</p><p>I have managed to create a virtual interface however i can&#039;t find for the life of me how to add the VLAN ID to the specific port....</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help</p>									</div>

					<p>Do you have a Network -&gt; Switch page?<br />It&#039;s reasonably self-explanatory.&nbsp; On the left side, click the button at the bottom to create a row then edit the number to be 2.&nbsp; Then place this tagged to the CPU port (it becomes eth0.2 or eth1.2), and untagged to one of the ethernet ports.&nbsp; Turn off that port in all the other VLANs. Make sure you have the port number right by plugging and unplugging a live cable, that will cause the status icon to change from plugged to unplugged.</p>									</div>
