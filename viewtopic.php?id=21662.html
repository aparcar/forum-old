					<p>Hi, I have installed openvpn and anything seems to work fine except I set &quot;user&quot; and &quot;group&quot; to nobody/nogroup but according to ps openvpn still&nbsp; runs under root. How can I run openvpn under nobody user? I quess I can alter init.d script and su to nobody prior running openvpn, but I think I will run in some problems with initializing tun. Thx.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have find out so /etc/config/openvpn IS NOT openvpn config file, its config file for its init script and &quot;user&quot; and &quot;group&quot; options are probably not&nbsp; implemented although some others are so its little confusing. If you want to use this options you have to pass config file to openvn like this:<br />option &#039;config&#039; &#039;/path/config_file</p><p>This way the &quot;user&quot; and &quot;group&quot; options works.</p>									</div>

If you want to enable the legacy config file, look under the custom_config section and set &quot;enable&quot; to 1. My advice, though, is to create a new config subsection to store your settings.</p>									</div>
