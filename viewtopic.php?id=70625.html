					<p>I have question which actually is not strictly related to OpenWRT (none of the following routers is capable for OpenWRT), however maybe someone here can help me out what should be correct/proper setup?</p><p>Description:<br />I have 2 WiFi routers <br />Please see this link for overview: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/05kg2b08jllhomo/WiFi.png?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/05kg2b08jllhomo/WiFi.png?dl=0</a></p><br /><p><strong>Livebox:</strong><br />- connected to the internet/pubic IP.<br />- LAN IP: 192.168.1.1<br />- LAN DHCP Server: 192.168.1.[2 - 100]<br />- WiFi name: Livebox</p><p><strong>Linksys (WAG54G2):</strong><br />- connected to Livebox via RJ45<br />- LAN IP: 192.168.1.<span style="color: red">2</span><br />- LAN DHCP Server and DHCP Relay - <strong><span style="color: red">disabled</span></strong><br />- WiFi name: Linksys</p><p>So, Livebox provides INTERNET to my home LAN and shares it over WiFi: Livebox. <br />Linksys is connected to Livebox via RJ45 cable and spreads it&#039;s WiFi: Linksys in the garage (where Livebox&#039;s WiFi has no coverage/very low coverage).<br />That works - Im talking about internet access. </p><p>Question:<br />Is that the way you would provide INTERNET to the area where main WiFi router has no coverage/very low coverage?</p><p><strong><span style="color: red">[UPDATE]</span></strong><br />corrected Linksys IP. Was 192.168.1.1. Should be 192.168.1.2 - typo error. Pointed out in the following answers.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>czezz</strong> on 17 Apr 2017, 05:30)</p>

					<p>Hey there.</p><p>Your image is actually bettern than your description.</p><p>Your description says you put 192.168.1.1 as IP address for both routes.<br />Your image says the second one has 192.168.1.2 instead.<br />Do it the way your image says: Use differen IP addresses for both routes.</p><p>Disable DHCP on your Linksys. That&#039;s correct. Don&#039;t do anything with DHCP relay.</p><p>Your description says you want to have 192.168.1.[2-100] as IP range provided by your Livebox.<br />Make sure the IP address of your second router is *not* part of that range, so better go 192.168.1.[100-250] which leaves you room for other devices with static address in the lower part of the range.</p><p>Connect both devices by RJ45.<br />That&#039;s exactly the way to go. This makes DHCP, DNS and routing from your Livebox available within the network spanned by the Linksys device.</p><p>Currently you use different SSIDs for your routers.<br />I wouldn&#039;t do that. Use the same SSID and the same encryption credentials on both. Your Wifi clients don&#039;t need to know about different stations, they should be able to connect to the first fitting station.</p><p>You didn&#039;t tell anything about Wifi channels. Make sure to use different ones for both routers. If you use the same channel in both devices, they will interfere.</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>									</div>

					<p>Your text says that they are both 192.168.1.1, that will not work.&nbsp; Picture shows the second one is 192.168.1.2 which is fine.&nbsp; Your setup is the standard way to do it.&nbsp; You can give them both the same SSID (wifi name) if you want.&nbsp; Devices should connect to whichever one they find stronger when they initially connect.</p><p>Channel selection should also consider what any nearby neighbors use.&nbsp; Take a survey for example with Wifi Analyzer (on Android).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 17 Apr 2017, 01:16)</p>
