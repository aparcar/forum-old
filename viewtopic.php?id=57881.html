					<p>Picked up a Linksys WRT54G V8,2 router at a garage sale last weekend. It&#039;s only partially functional, namely only about half of its web pages exist. This is the stock Linksys firmware. I can set its IP address, set DHCP to off, but the wireless config web page is blank. And the administration page is likewise blank. Which means I cant update the firmware using the administration pages. So it looks like the firmware is partially corrupt.</p><p>Okay, tried using TFTP, but that didn&#039;t work. I can ping the router. I set the router address to 192.168.1.1 and the PC to 192.168.1.7, and checked the box in the Win 7 control panel menu that enables such programs like TFTP.</p><p>Any ideas? Not like I spent that much for this router, like $2, but if there&#039;s an easy way that I haven&#039;t figured out, thanks in advance. I&#039;m just looking to install Linksys firmware, after that maybe openwrt.</p>									</div>
