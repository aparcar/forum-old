					<p>Hi!</p><p>I have found a lot of mixed information about WDS &amp; bridging so I thought its is important to clarify some points and because of that I create this post.<br />Using MAC80211 WDS (Kernel 2.6) I was able to do WDS+AP to WDS+STA after some struggle with encryption problems, etc. I use WPA-PSK2 encryption and Backfire 10.03.1, the latest<br />I have follow this link <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds</a> to do this.</p><p>My Wireless config files are (If someone need I can put also the network config file):</p><p>Firts - WDS+AP side:</p><p>config wifi-device&nbsp; radio0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option type&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;mac80211<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option channel&nbsp; 36<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option macaddr&nbsp; &nbsp; xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option hwmode&nbsp; &nbsp; 11a<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option disabled 0</p><p>config wifi-iface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option device&nbsp; &nbsp;radio0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option network&nbsp; lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option mode&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ap<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ssid&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;OpenWrt<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option wds 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option encryption psk2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option key&nbsp; &nbsp; passkey</p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>Second - WDS+STA side:</p><p>config wifi-device&nbsp; radio0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option type&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;mac80211<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option channel&nbsp; 36<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option macaddr&nbsp; &nbsp; yy:yy:yy:yy:yy:yy<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option hwmode&nbsp; &nbsp; 11a<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option disabled 0</p><p>config wifi-iface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option device&nbsp; &nbsp;radio0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option network&nbsp; lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option mode&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sta<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ssid&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;OpenWrt<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option wds 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option encryption psk2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option key&nbsp; &nbsp; passkey</p><br /><p>1-The first thing that was strange, for me, is that this works without the option bssid yy:yy:yy:yy:yy:yy on AP side, and bssid xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx on STA side. Is this normal or I&#039;m doing something really wrong?</p><p>2-When I&#039;m trying to connect a second WDS+STA to the WDS+AP, this do not work. I&#039;m putting the same code that is in the first STA. Is this a firmware problem, or what you think? Do I need to do some alteration in the WDSA+AP? A tip will be important for me.</p><p>3-In this link, <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds</a> , there are one sentence that I do not understand very well. It sys &quot;To have an AP to AP WDS simply set an AP on the client in addition to the sta (with the same ssid and key, or not).&quot; - this means that to have WDS AP to WDS AP is possible, by replacing in wireless config file of the WDS+STA the &quot;option mode sta&quot; for this &quot;option mode ap&quot; is so simple than that?</p><p>Thanks in advanced<br />Jenifer</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi!</p><p>Thanks for the advise fyi.<br />This firts question I put that, because with broadcom drivers under the Wifi-Ifice configurations there are a lot of configuration with&nbsp; &quot;option bssid yy:yy:yy:yy:yy:yy&quot;, and i was thinking that was necessary also on mac80211 driver but for my surprise, it is not necessary.</p><p>When I&#039;m trying to connect a second WDS+STA to the WDS+AP, this work only for some time.&nbsp; I&#039;m putting the same code that is in the first STA.

					<p>Hi!</p><p>I&#039;m trying to do this:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/img/2009/01/wds.jpg" alt="http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/img/2009/01/wds.jpg" /></span></p><p>You can see the layout for a WDS network with two &quot;generations.&quot; The parent router—A—has WDS links to two children, B and C. To further extend the reach of the network, a second generation—D—has been added using WDS link to router C.</p><p>Configuration is in a simple form:(if need I can put all config, that is very equal to the configuration above...)<br />Parent A have a wireless VAP1 (wifi-iface1) in wds-ap mode to children B and another wireless VAP2 (Wifi-iface2) in wds-ap mode to children C.<br />Children B have a wireless VAP1 (wifi-iface1) in wds-sta mode.<br />Children C have a wireless VAP1 (wifi-iface1) in wds-sta to connect to Parent A and another VAP2 (wifi-face2) in wds-ao mode to children D.</p><p>Unfortunately I&#039;m still straggly to put this working good. Can someone advise me if this steps are correct, or I&#039;m missing something?</p><p>The WDS configuration for each router I think that will require that you enter the MAC address for the wireless LAN of the paired router. So, the WDS configuration for router A will contain the MAC addresses for the wireless LAN of routers B and C. Likewise, the configuration for router B will contain the wireless LAN MAC address for router A. And so on. - on mac80211 driver but for my surprise, it was not necessary. Can someone explained what happens and why is not needed?? this is make me confuse.</p><br /><p>Thanks in advanced,<br />Regards<br />Jenifer</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Milljenifer</strong> on 19 Jan 2012, 17:00)</p>
