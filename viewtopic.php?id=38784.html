					<p>This router is about two things shy of awesome right now.</p><p>I believe that I found this router briefly mentioned on the Wiki and that it is running some version of OpenWRT.&nbsp; I am not clear if there is current support for this router or not, but Here are the issues I have with the device:</p><p>1) The only USB support the manufacturer included is some weird software that makes your USB drive act like it is a local USB drive over the wifi, but that limits you to being connected to only one PC at a time.&nbsp; Pretty useless for the purposes of a networked drive.</p><p>2) IPv6, the only options for IPv6 are a tunnel to Freenet6.&nbsp; Then it is limited to three options in Canada, Australia, or Amsterdam; that is all but useless to me in the states.&nbsp; Comcast in my area supports IPv6, so I would love to do more with IPv6.&nbsp; The performance with their options is horrendously bad. </p><p>I&#039;d love to turn the radio output up a little too, but I would be happy if I could just fix those two things.&nbsp; I have tried the manufacturers website support contact form and forums, neither have yielded anything.</p><p>Suggestions?</p>									</div>

					<p>Further update:</p><p>It shows under Telnet that it is running OpenWRT.&nbsp; It says 5-28-2012 BusyBox 1.4.2 Built-in Shell (ash).&nbsp; Mindspeed technologies build 7.0 for Comcerto is at the bottom of the screen just before the command prompt</p>									</div>
