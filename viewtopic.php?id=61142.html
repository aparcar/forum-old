					<p>I think you are correct.&nbsp; There is no call for the file in the options values.&nbsp; <br />I made all my keys under windows, and ignored the generation steps in OpenWrt.&nbsp; <br />I used WinSCP to copy up my files and do not have the ca.key on my server.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think the previous advice is a bit wrong.&nbsp; Certainly, I think someone typed ca.crt when they meant to type ca.key.</p><p>Only ca.key _must_ be kept private, whilst ca.key can (_should_) be published appropriately.&nbsp; That is, only ca.key, is the &#039;most secret file of all&#039;; I certainly wouldn&#039;t have multiple copies of ca.key floating around.</p><p>In fact, ca.crt _should_ be distributed to the PKI (public key infrastructure) clients; it is the root certificate.&nbsp; The &#039;users&#039; of the PKI would trust the ca.crt, and therefore (by inheritance) also trust any certificates issued by that CA.&nbsp; This saves you having to distribute server-2.crt, server-3.crt, etc. to the PKI clients if/when they are created sometime in the future.</p><p>Think of the CA as a government (e.g. the USA, or the UK), and server.crt as a passport.&nbsp; If you trust the UK government (i.e. the UK ca.crt is in your keystore), then you actually trust that one of their valid passports correctly identifies the person sitting in front of you (someone who you have never met before).</p><p>Note that the word &#039;trust&#039; here does not mean trusting someone&#039;s behavior, only trusting their identity, as in: I know you&#039;re a tiger (identity), and I therefore expect you to bite me (behaviour).</p><p>Having said all that:<br /> - often, server.crt will include a copy of ca.crt<br /> - I wouldn&#039;t have multiple copies of ca.key on a server<br /> - you can take ca.key offline, but it is needed for CA operations, such as creating/revoking server certificates, etc.</p><p>Best practice is as follows:<br />1. create a Root CA and use it to create a (child) CA (once that&#039;s done, take its key off line)<br />2. use the CA to create user/server certificates (leave its key online)</p><p>HTH, Dave</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zxdavb</strong> on 26 Nov 2015, 09:14)</p>

OpenVPN with easy-rsa is still a lot better than PPTP. Or worse, finding some random certificates on the internet that just happens to work.</p><p>Perhaps we should make a Raspberry Pi Zero version of OpenWRT for the sole purpose of being a private CA:<br /><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-zero/">https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-zero/</a><br /> 1) Custom OpenWRT &gt; SD-card<br /> 2) Insert USB key with simple config file (or just empty folders - one for server, one for each client)<br /> 3) Power up<br /> 4) Wait<br /> 5) Shut down. Certificates found on USB key.<br />Keep RPi Zero (with SD card) in safe place, until next time a certificate is needed.</p>									</div>
