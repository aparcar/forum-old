					<p>@moxu</p><p>There is no difference to building the different versions. It does not matter if you are compiling in a Docker container or virtualized in any way as that would be exactly like a normal environment. As long as you have the build prerequisities installed it should be as simple as &quot;make menuconfig &amp;&amp; make V=99&quot;. I can&#039;t understand that you tried 10+ times and did not manage to build <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> Did you create a thread in the forum with your error? The error message should tell you exactly what went wrong, so with the internet at your disposal it should be easy to fix.</p><p>You don&#039;t actually need to compile your own either. You can just go with the stable releases or a snapshot if you like.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>arokh</strong> on 5 Jul 2016, 14:50)</p>

					<p>@arokh</p><p>after writing that comment I built the image perfectly on my first try with no errors.. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p><p>Without any modifications or patches everything worked... One of my favorite features of openwrt that is the ability to to install packages avail in the ecosystem, but the main feed is using a different kernel... so I can&#039;t really download much anymore using this optimized build.

Maybe if it&#039;s all on git there&#039;s a possiblity of downloading the lastest commit with compatibilty with the kernel used.</p><p>2) Now that I know I can&nbsp; build a baseline image, what&#039;s the minimal amount of effort necessary to modify the patches for compatibility with whatever&#039;s currently considered &#039;trunk&#039;? </p><p>That&#039;s why I&#039;m posting ihere instead of in general - because I want to learn how to build this image specifically, because it&#039;s awesome.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>moxu</strong> on 6 Jul 2016, 07:14)</p>

					<p>@moxu</p><p>Good to hear, congrats <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> Indeed, kernel modules needs to be installed from the same build. In some cases you can force install different versions, but it&#039;s not recommended. Regular packages should work fine when installed from the feeds though.</p><p>1. If it&#039;s compatibility you&#039;re after, compile from a release branch. Then &quot;opkg list&quot; will be it.</p><p>2. i don&#039;t understand your question, could you be more specific about what you&#039;re trying to do?</p><p>There is no difference to compile this image, it&#039;s OpenWrt.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well good on ya moxu! I&#039;m going the completely stark raving mad route of cherry picking my build. Trying to use Lede as the base, and then use the patches for the features I need on my C7 from arok, and a few patches from Hnyman. I think I&#039;ll just try and build a plain vanilla, and then add in features as I go. (Arok, is there any kind of attribution I need to add if I use your patches/diffs/file scripts?) </p><p>In any case, hope you are doing well and enjoying whatever endeavor you&#039;re embarking on now!</p><p>Edit: I&#039;m building for the 3700v2 as well, that&#039;s why I mentioned Hnyman, sorry...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>SoAMG</strong> on 9 Jul 2016, 00:32)</p>

					<p>@arokh -&nbsp; I have a lot&nbsp; of&nbsp; respect for you making this build - It&#039;s non trivial and time consuming <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /> what prevented me from compiling are a frw dependecies that never resolved to a URL - it&#039;s frustrating. </p><p>Anyways, some feedback - (for anyone<br />Whose curious)The deps prob need to be updated to continue building. That&#039;s a bout it - but it&#039;s not automagick unfortunately.</p><p>One way this could be potentially be alleviated would be to leverage the layers of a docker container. Because each stage becomes an &#039;immutable&#039; layer that&#039;s hashed and addressable and reusable and cached.</p><p>The current options are to compile from source&nbsp; - communnity builds - and snapshots.<br />With docker - we could just use the layer of container as the source instead of third party libraries that change. It&#039;s like a snapshot - and with the right snap shots - 1-3<br />hours might taken 15-20 minutes. I dunno. It&#039;s like... a makefile. Just like makefiles build source code - docker runs makefiles and creates reusable layers. The process would be identical, except we&#039;:d have snapshots and an ability to share thr exact work environment&nbsp; - no more instructions.</p><p>I apologize again for rambling - I just want a stable build - and lede is currently more stable than chaos calmer even though it&#039;s inconsistent and who knows if a nightly build was published while someobody was half way through patching a kernel extension. And is it being tested at all?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>moxu</strong> on 16 Jul 2016, 07:12)</p>

					<p>@coxmobil thanks - I had to edit my post because I started writing about LEDE&#039;s inconsistencies due to fast iteration cycles - BUT - I came back here to say that they have a build suite with some documentation regarding what changed - it&#039;s not easy to find.. but it exists! If I&#039;m bored one day maybe I&#039;ll just create the forum. I haven&#039;t contacted anybody because they use an EMAIL LIST but I&#039;lll ask on the IRC - mostly just curious about people&#039;s experience with it. I think they need a web dev with some free time - which is why there&#039;s no wiki or forum (and the site&#039;s on github explicitly asking for help).

TOR is less important for me as it just serves as a guest access point. Is it possible to add Guest access for the next release of this firmware. This feature is very useful in our office, where we want to separate our guests from our internal network while leaving them some bandwidth to surf.</p>									</div>
