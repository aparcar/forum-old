					<p>Good morning,</p><p>Upon reading the page for this device, I noticed that V9 doesn&#039;t seem to have USB available (at least easily).<br />I believe I have a V9 (not at home now, but will check), it was purchased second hand but is new, and would be happy if it had USB capabilities so I could plug a USB drive or even an HDD with external supply.</p><p>Surfing through the internet, I found this:</p><p><a href="http://www.anywlan.com/article-4325-1.html">http://www.anywlan.com/article-4325-1.html</a></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://i.gyazo.com/d0e39a8c4ef7781199313a6dd8a22119.png" alt="https://i.gyazo.com/d0e39a8c4ef7781199313a6dd8a22119.png" /></span></p><p>That topic is directly pointed to V9 - and USB pins might be accessible.</p><p>They even go as far as to provide a firmware for it:</p><p><a href="http://pan.baidu.com/s/1c0ldEEG">http://pan.baidu.com/s/1c0ldEEG</a></p><br /><p>So, what do you think?</p><p>I have a soldering station, hot air rework station, and I would be available to mod it. However, I&#039;m a (very) starving student, so I really need this working - besides, I&#039;m not the only user.</p><p>Sorry if anyone has already posted this, but I did search for this model and version and no hits for USB mods.</p><p>Best wishes,<br />Nuno</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey Nuno, I also have version 9 of wr841n.&nbsp; That website seems to be legit, but I can`t know forsure until I open my wr841n up.&nbsp; Have you given it a try yet?&nbsp; I`d love to hear of any results.&nbsp; I`m ready to try anything to improve this router, I am not great with soldering and I have limited equipment but I`m willing to give it a try.&nbsp; Clearly here: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd</a> it says that USB is not supported on v9 but if we follow the usb guide for v8 with that website info you have above we should hopefully be able to get it to work.&nbsp; There are a lot of trolls but there is some good info here: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=37010">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=37010</a> for the v8 hardware upgrade.&nbsp; Adding a usb isn`t the only option, have you considered upgrading the RAM?&nbsp; I will pull my router apart tomorrow to see what I can do, I hope to hear back from you, cheers!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>iThunder</strong> on 17 Apr 2016, 09:16)</p>

					<p>If your TL-WR841Nv9 is based on QCA9531 (unlikely) then USB mod is possible.<br />If there is QCA9533 then just forget, because this SOC version doesn&#039;t have USB.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the update Pepe, I will open up my router tomorrow to see what I have, hopefully it&#039;s a qca9531 that somehow supports USB.&nbsp; I feel that the odds are against me on this one..</p>									</div>

					<p>Alright, I pulled my router apart this morning.&nbsp; It was pretty easy, only 2 screws! But unfortunately it was a qca9533 so I&#039;ll take pepe2k&#039;s word for it that a usb cannot be installed.&nbsp; I have pictures if anyone wants to see, I don&#039;t know how to upload those though lol, if someone would be so kind as to show me..</p>									</div>
