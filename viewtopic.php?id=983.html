					<p>OpenWrt boots just fine on the GX, the issue is that the wireless driver does not appear to work on the OpenWrt kernel and debuging a binary only module is a slow process.</p>									</div>

					<p>i just opend up a linksys WRT54GX-AU i guess the AU is just for australian version<br />after a bit of dismantling i got to the wifi end of the unit<br />the mimo minipci or should i say HUGEpci heh... coz its soo massive compared to a normal card it can hardly be called minipci. the chipset is AIRGO from AIRGO networks.&nbsp; i went to the web site there is apparently some kind of GPL code around<br />at the url <a href="http://gpl.airgonetworks.com">http://gpl.airgonetworks.com</a>/ however this link was broken or perhaps overloaded or something. so i have no idea what is actually there to download</p><p>-----snip------<br />Software </p><p>Airgo Networks provides ready to use full-featured software that shortens time-to-market and takes advantage of Airgo&#039;s high performance product designs and chipsets. Available software includes:</p><p>Comprehensive Manufacturing Test Support Utilities <br />Turnkey Windows NDIS Drivers <br />Customizable Full-Featured Client Application Utilities <br />System Software </p><p>Link to GPL Code Center</p><p>-----snip-----</p><p>is there hope for the driver code to be avail to use with openwrt??<br />or perhaps some kind of makeshift NDIS windows driver loader possible??</p><p>i certainly agree that there is some improvement in signal/throughput seeing as im involved in building hotspots for various markets.... this unit would be ideal for a small cafe or single unit on premises acting as hotspot so id love to see openwrt on the WRT54GX unit.</p><p>let me know if there is something i can do to help make it happen</p><p>for now i can offer pictures of the unit disasembled or any parts listing and or pictures from the unit</p><p>i have sent an email to airgonetworks asking why that link is broken. ill report their reply.</p><br /><p>regards</p><p>_HiDDeN_<br /><a href="http://www.wirelessholidays.com">www.wirelessholidays.com</a></p>									</div>

					<p>I wrote to Airgo, saying come, give us the tools so we can run our own firmware, got a marketing droid response..<br />it&#039;s here, how very upsetting. </p><p>looks like I&#039;ll be avoiding airgo products myself then.. <br />---------------------------SNIP----------------------</p><br /><p>Sent: Tuesday, May 10, 2005 10:11 AM<br />To: Nicole Martin<br />Cc: webmaster@moskaluk.com<br />Subject: 802.11n for linux please.</p><p>Hi this is a open to letter to airgo networks, please<br />relases linux kernel drivers for your 802.11n<br />products.
