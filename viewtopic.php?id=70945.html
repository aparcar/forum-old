					<p>I could only find an old topic that didn&#039;t really answer the question of whether openwrt was possible on this router.&nbsp; I currently have dd-wrt running on it fine, but have recently discovered the bliss of openwrt since having to put it on another router dd-wrt was giving me nightmares over.</p><p>Unit has BCM4708A CPU and BCM4360 radios.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>WWTK</p>									</div>

					<p>well the drivers are all available and fully functional not really sure what you intended I gain from that link?</p><br /><p>I&#039;m guessing that since there was only one other request for this device there probably isn&#039;t going to be a anyone wanting to spend much time in building the firmware for it.&nbsp; If that&#039;s the case no problem I understand, but hey it doesn&#039;t hurt to ask.</p><p>WWTK</p>									</div>
