					<p>First off, thank you for operating this forum.<br />I am a complete noob when it comes to CLI, linux and the like.<br />I was able to flash the image, logon on, ssh, etc.<br />I have tried unsuccessfully to view the files in Konqueror ( I am running Ubuntu 13), which I think would make my job editing the files much easier. I can ssh using konsole, but trying to figure my way around is driving me crazy.<br />Ideally I am trying to setup danguardian and tinyproxy to help block websites from my daughter&#039;s inquisitive eyes.<br />I installed luci this morning (not sure why), and this is what I get: <br />root@Gargoyle:~# /etc/init.d/uhttpd start<br />bind(): Address already in use<br />Error: No sockets bound, unable to continue<br />So I tried:<br />root@Gargoyle:~# /etc/init.d/uhttpd restart<br />bind(): Address already in use<br />Error: No sockets bound, unable to continue</p><p>I probably should not have install anything else without first fixing the initial problem of getting dansguardian and tiny proxy figured out first.<br />I did extroot a usb drive to the router so I could have the extra space, and I do see the extra space.</p><p>Ideas?</p><p>*edit* rebooted the router and now https works (that was the whole purpose of luci, correct?).<br />Still have no idea about dansguardian and tinyproxy.</p><p>*edit* Alright, luci is a totally different interface, and I like it. Good grief. Anyways, I am seeing the following on the top line in the browser: This page contains the following errors:<br />error on line 204 at column 57: expected &#039;&gt;&#039;<br />Below is a rendering of the page up to the first error.</p><p>This is the System/Software page. It shows no installed packages, and no available packages.</p><p>I am actually starting to wonder if I should just re-flash the image and start out new.</p><p>**edit, again**<br />Re-flashed without uninstalling everything, and now I have a mess. Had to go buy another router. Just texted the wife, ugh...</p><p>So, I was unable to access the router. SYS light blinks, no wifi, and no ssh ability into the internals. Is it bricked?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>paramedic233</strong> on 11 Mar 2014, 21:09)</p>

					<p>Alright I was able to boot into the router using the failsafe method, telnet 192.168.1.1.<br />I followed the instructions, and rebooted the router.<br />Now what?</p><p>*edit*<br />Alright. connected to lan1, ssh&#039;d into the router. and it is now showing root@gargoyle:/# which I think is where I need to be.<br />Attempted opkg, and it went through the motions. WOOOOHOOOO! Thank you!!!<br />Not sure if I want to attempt luci again, although it was a sweet interface, but if I do, how do I prevent running into the same issue again?</p><p>So, my three issues are luci, dansguardian, and a proxy.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>paramedic233</strong> on 12 Mar 2014, 15:27)</p>
