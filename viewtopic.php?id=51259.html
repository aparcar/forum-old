					<p>I am having problems finding firmware to flash the TP-Link WR710n (for attitude adjustment) and decided to download and compile it.</p><p>As per the page for the hardware <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr710n">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr710n</a> , I have downloaded the svn 40804 trunk using attitude adjustment, updated the feeds&nbsp; and compiled it using make defconfig and make V=s. all went ok.&nbsp; It creates the usual list of images in the bin directory but not one for the wr710n.&nbsp; </p><p>When I use the trunk version and svn 40804 it does create the image for wr710n but I&#039;m not sure it this will be stable or not.</p><p>Does anyone have a working firmware for the TP-Link WR710n they can upload?</p><p>Is there a trick to getting this to work with Attitude adjustment and is there any way of flashing this through the web gui without having to do the serial mod?</p><p>thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>garthpen</strong> on 1 Jul 2014, 01:54)</p>

					<p>Didn&#039;t want to brick this unit but decided to push ahead and compiled BB with r40804 and it did create firmware for the TL-WR710N.</p><p>Compiled and flashed it using BB r40804 from-factory image by using the upgrade option of the web interface. loaded luci onto it, but the wireless adapter was not recognised by luci.</p><p>Downloaded the latest snapshot image from the web and flashed the upgrade-image via web interface and it works.=)</p><p>Now I am trying to set up an alfa 1 AWUS036H on the usb port in client mode with the WR710N in AP mode (requires&nbsp; rtl8187 and dependencies to be added). This would make a very compact repeater to drag in long distance signals using the Alfa 1 which has a sensitive receiver, for my hotel visits.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>garthpen</strong> on 1 Jul 2014, 01:55)</p>
