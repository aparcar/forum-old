We had some discussions how to name things in the luci GUI, and opted for simple terms that for the usual situation are correct. We might want to revisit this in the future...</p><p>Best Regards<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>

					<p>hnyman in your latest Chaos build (48629) it seems that DnsMasq is ignoring the cachesize option. It seems to be defaulting to 1000, as I recall that used to be 150. When I add the cachesize option to /etc/config/dhcp it always defaults to 1000 no matter what number I add to the config file.

Adblock uses three different components, first it sets ad sites DNS info to the special backhole, then it sets firewall rules to block ads (handle the traffic by routing it to the blackhole address) and finally sets up an extra www server at the router (to provide 1 pixel image instead of ads). The DNS server and the www server can be any computer in LAN, but adblock&#039;s new firewall rules need to be applied in the router taking care of NAT and outgoing traffic.</p>									</div>

					<p>First of, thanks for the great build you share with us!</p><p>In light of the recent hosting issues, would it be possible for you to include tcpdump into your trunk builds, please? When testing I often need to create packet captures to figure out whether things work as expected, but for the trunk builds this is a bit tricky... Currently I can not install tcpdump at all since the repository seems elusive, but even in the normal state this was tricky enough, due to the race with trunk&#039;s build-bot. Often I only managed to install your builds in the evening when the trunk packages where already newer and did not want to install any more. I know, I should install earlier, but due to $DAYJOB I only work on this in my spare time..</p><p>Anyway, thanks again for sharing your great builds with us.</p><p>Best Regards</p>									</div>
