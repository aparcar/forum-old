					<p>So I had the same trouble but after some looking around I got mine to work like this.&nbsp; First I installed the luci-app-qos and luci-app-splash.</p><p>I added a 8 hour time ,1024x256 qos and added a lan rule to the interface section.&nbsp; The wifi was in the lan firewall zone.</p><p>That got the installation working with the default splash page.</p><p>I added a custom html to the&quot;Edit the complete splash text&quot; under splashtext section under but it wouldn&#039;t save.&nbsp; After looking around in the router through ssh (Midnight Commander) is your friend.&nbsp; I got the Splashtext section working by adding this directory /usr/lib/luci-splash. Now I have it working with a custom html splash page.</p><p>Hope this helps</p>									</div>
