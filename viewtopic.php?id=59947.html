					<p>Hello all, finally got OpenWRT on my router- kind of a newbie here on this.</p><p>I have all my interfaces working, 5G, 2.4G and LAN working with solid internet on my WNDR3400 from Netgear...&nbsp; </p><p>LAN and wired Lan connections to the internet are nice and quick, but wireless, 5G and 2.4G are limited to about 15Mbps on a 75Mbps connection...&nbsp; </p><p>I have it on AES encryption - I have my channels optimized...&nbsp; I&#039;m running 15.05 and I have tried earlier versions as well ...</p><p>My first thought is it may be the included wifi driver for my chipset...&nbsp; How would I go investigating / fixing this? </p><br /><p>Thanks for the help in advance.</p><p>p.s. I&#039;ve managed the full 75Mbps on ddwrt - I just want to be able to use opkg and mumble on my router.&nbsp; hmph.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>monsieurtalbot</strong> on 28 Sep 2015, 00:07)</p>
