					<p>Hi guys,<br />I have TP-Link wr841ND V10 which originally has 4MB memory, I need more than that to install a new system with package so I upgraded to 8MB. I copied content of 4MB memory to 8MB memory and system works fine. Unfortunately my ‘make V=s’ didn’t give me sysupgrade file but only following:<br />size&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; name<br />6˙946˙816 openwrt-ar71xx-generic-root.squashfs<br />6˙815˙748 openwrt-ar71xx-generic-root.squashfs-64k<br /> 2˙043˙406 openwrt-ar71xx-generic-uImage-gzip.bin<br /> 1˙461˙676 openwrt-ar71xx-generic-uImage-lzma.bin<br /> 1˙533˙641 openwrt-ar71xx-generic-vmlinux-lzma.elf<br /> 4˙455˙404 openwrt-ar71xx-generic-vmlinux.bin<br /> 4˙460˙468 openwrt-ar71xx-generic-vmlinux.elf<br /> 2˙097˙152 openwrt-ar71xx-generic-vmlinux.gz<br /> 1˙507˙328 openwrt-ar71xx-generic-vmlinux.lzma</p><p>Which method and file should I choose. Can I just write any of this files directly into memory using memory programmer?<br />Thanks,<br />Mat</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>basketmat</strong> on 10 Apr 2017, 15:55)</p>

					<p>To answer your question directly, I think you would cat together the uimage-lzma.bin (the kernel) and the squashfs-64k.&nbsp; But I have never tried that.</p><p>If the packages you specify would make the file too large for 4M, a sysupgrade file is not produced.&nbsp; You would need to create a new model in the makefile with 8MB size specified.</p><p>I have put larger flash chips in a few TP-Links.&nbsp; The TP-Link builds have a very nice feature that they detect the size of the flash during boot and make the partitions accordingly.&nbsp; You don&#039;t need a custom build.&nbsp; I use release builds (for the 4M chip) and install the additional packages online.</p><p>To format a new flash chip my way, make copies of the bootloader and ART from the factory flash and place them in the first 128k and the last 64k of the chip respectively.&nbsp; Place a release sysupgrade.bin in the chip after the bootloader.&nbsp; Install this chip and it should boot up and build a jffs2 with the extra space usable.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello again,<br /><strong>mk24 </strong>- thanks for reply. <br />Enabling/installing some packages makes my kernel bigger than 1024KB, which makes problem more complicated.</p><p>I managed to compile images for 16MB flash by changing makefile (I upgraded from 8 to 16MB) and unfortunatelly it does not help at all:<br />First of all I installed <em>pepe2k u-boot</em> which can manage my memory and it boots beautifully. <br />Than through it I tried <em>sysupgrade </em>and <em>factory</em> images but both gave me the same answer - <strong>Kernel panic</strong>:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[    0.360000] UBIFS error (pid 1): ubifs_mount: cannot open &quot;ubi0:rootfs&quot;, error -19
[    0.380000] VFS: Cannot open root device &quot;31:02&quot; or unknown-block(31,2): error -6
[    0.380000] Please append a correct &quot;root=&quot; boot option; here are the available partitions:

[    0.390000] ---[ end Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(31,2)</code></pre></div><p>So I thought why not place my files directly into memory and change <strong>mtdparts</strong> in <em>printenv</em>.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>bootargs=console=ttyS0,115200 root=/mtd3 rootfstype=squashfs init=/sbin/init mtdparts=ath-nor0:128k(u-boot),2048k(kernel),14080k(rootfs),64k(config),64k(art) </code></pre></div><p>I placed it like this and changed <strong>root</strong>:<br /><em>uboot - 0x9f000000 +0x20000<br />kernel - 0x9f020000 +0x200000<br />rootfs - 0x9f220000 +0xDC0000<br />config - 0x9ffe0000 +0x10000<br />art - 0x9fff0000 +0x10000</em></p><p>After booting kernel error is the same with a little change:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[    0.360000] UBIFS error (pid 1): ubifs_mount: cannot open &quot;ubi0:rootfs&quot;, error -19

I cant find it anywhere.<br />What can I do next?<br />Thanks <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>If the flash chip is not a type supported by the kernel build, you will get this.&nbsp; Does your boot log show the mtd partitions being created? <br />Any partition stuff you may put on the command line will not be used.&nbsp; There is a C module (tplinkparts.c ?) that dynamically sets up the partitions during boot. This depends on the SPI flash driver recognizing the chip and reporting its size.</p>									</div>
