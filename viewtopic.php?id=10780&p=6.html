					<p>Hi peeps.</p><p> I know this thread is pretty dead, but I was hoping I could get two questions answered:</p><p>1) Everyone in this thread was talking about modding the early WRT54GL to 64MB RAM, but I was wondering if you can mod a WRT54GS v2 to 64MB RAM? This model has 32MB RAM stock, and uses one RAM chip of 66 pins. The type of RAM is Hynix HY5DU561622DT-J. I found a datasheet here:<br /><a href="http://www.datasheetcatalog.org/datasheet2/b/0fqkwuwp789ywg54skkeepeehy7y.pdf">http://www.datasheetcatalog.org/datashe … eehy7y.pdf</a></p><p>This RAM is rated as 256Mbit (16M x 16), which satisfies that it is 16 bit, not 8bit. Rated as -J it is 133MHz@CL2, 166MHz@CL2.5, and DDR333 (2.5-3-3) (CL-tRCD-tRP). I note that the Row Address is A0 - A12, and Column Address is A0-A8. <br />It seems that this chip can be upgraded, but I want to make sure from someone else who can verify my information.</p><p>I&#039;d like to upgrade this chip to a 512Mbit chip which is also 16 bit. There have been some suggestions already as to which chips to try, and have had success. Before I remove my RAM chip, I&#039;d like to make sure it is possible for me to go forward.</p><p>----------------------</p><p>2) I&#039;m confused about the no contact pins, or the extra wires. It seems this is specific to the Linksys router board, not to the chip? I assume that all pins are soldered down. Is this just a straight swap chip-for-chip and then change settings in NVRAM, or do I need to worry about re-wiring pins and such?</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for posting a response, I was afraid this thread was dead. However it doesn&#039;t really answer my question. I have a WRT54GS v2, and I would rather not buy a 5 year old WRT54GL just to mod it to get more RAM... My current router is just fine, and I was thinking about extending its life a little by upping the RAM. But thank you for sharing the info on the Flash upgrade, I&#039;m sure that is useful somehow for increasing the JFFS2 file system size. I guess since most firmwares only use 4mb, you now have 12mb of free space for additional software?</p><p>One more thing...<br />The WRT54GL v1 is basically just a reissue of the WRT54G v4 without VXworks, but with Linux. The WRT54G v4 took a dive in hardware to lower costs for main-stream consumers, while the WRT54GL maintained that hardware (RAM, Flash) for back-end development amongst programmers and enthusiasts. The WRT54GS v2 is basically a WRT54G v2.2 with speedbooster software, and additional RAM and Flash to the WRT54G. The wiki here: <a href="http://nuwiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/OpenWrtDocs/Customizing/Hardware/RAM_upgrade">http://nuwiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/OpenW … AM_upgrade</a> says that you can do this upgrade on WRT54G v2-v4. But no mention of WRT54GS. I guess most people are happy with their WRT54GS and don&#039;t bother to try to push it further.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Fredvs79</strong> on 9 Sep 2009, 03:21)</p>
