					<p>I am using since some month a Tplink MR3220 V1 + 32GB&nbsp; pendrive as bittorrent client and i would like to know the best settings for the transmission-daemon:</p><p>there are a swap partition (320MB), extroot partition and data partition all on the usb pendrive, and only transmission and vsftp (no web, no samba, no minidlna) but&nbsp; if i add a couple of new torrent and there are more than 8/9 torrents in list, the box sooner or later&nbsp; crashes and&nbsp; reboots..</p><p>It seems to me that the crashes are more related to the number of completed torrents in list (stopping them does not make difference for this)&nbsp; than to the max download speed..</p><p>PS: AA 12.09 RC2, Transmission 2.83-1</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>spy00a35</strong> on 14 Jul 2014, 19:38)</p>
