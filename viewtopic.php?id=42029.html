					<p>Hi. Has anyone managed to configure the windows 7 vpn to work with gargoyle? running<br />1.5.8 w/ tp-link 1043nd v. 1.8. I&#039;ve forwarded tcp-1723 and udp 500 but no luck.<br />I don&#039;t know how to ssh at all, and heard something about a GRE port, but no idea<br />what to do. Any thoughts/suggestions are appreciated.<br />update: <br />ok, this is frustrating. I went looking and found info on the opkg update opkg install<br />kmod-ipt-nathelper-extra command, figured out putty, ran the commands at the following<br />website:<br /><a href="http://damsteen.nl/blog/how-to-configur">http://damsteen.nl/blog/how-to-configur</a> ... assthrough<br />and nothing. I can&#039;t even connect the windows 7 vpn from within the lan. Maybe that&#039;s<br />foolish to try, but I&#039;m not sure what else to do. The routing and remote access service<br />is started, port 1723 tcp is forwarded. I&#039;ve gotten the error 807 which says something<br />about the vpn being interrupted, and the error that says the attempted vpn tunnels<br />failed, and the one about the name of the dns not resolving. Is there anything else<br />I can do?<br /> I use Gargoyle as the gui but now I figured out a bit of this ssh.</p>									</div>
