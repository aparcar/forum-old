					<p>I am starting a new thread to hopefully get level-set on the current stat of support.&nbsp; Some of the patches are in the trunk, some are not, and it has been a challenge.&nbsp; Hopefully, others who want to help can get a head start based on this post. I&#039;ve built OpenWrt on yesterday&#039;s trunk, and I have gotten at least as far as most others (it seems).</p><p>I have compared 5 of the patches that I saw from previous threads to the 2.6.30.10 kernel.</p><p>I have collected them here:</p><p><a href="http://www.oaktreepeak.com/rb450g-original.tar.gz">http://www.oaktreepeak.com/rb450g-original.tar.gz</a></p><p>Here are the results, near as I can tell:</p><p>Original patches compared to kernel 2.6.30.10</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; routerboard-kernel-001.patch is not in trunk<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; routerboard-kernel-002.patch is in trunk<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; routerboard-kernel-003.patch - ethernet patches are in trunk (in different files), SPI patch is not in trunk<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; routerboard-kernel-004.patch is in trunk in different files<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; routerboard-kernel-005.patch is in trunk in different files</p><p>Modified patches for kernel 2.6.30.10:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; routerboard-kernel-001.patch<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; routerboard-kernel-003.patch (subset of original patch, new line numbers)</p><p>These patches go in {trunk}/target/linux/ar71xx/patches-2.6.30/</p><p>You can download these new patches here:</p><p><a href="http://www.oaktreepeak.com/rb450g-new.tar.gz">http://www.oaktreepeak.com/rb450g-new.tar.gz</a></p><p>Note that without the first patch, you will not be able to flash your RB450G because the NAND partitions will be mis-sized.</p><p>The second patch is marked &quot;experimental&quot; and is for the SD slot.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t tried it yet.</p><p>No guarantees, but I can build and flash this and it boots and comes up pretty well.&nbsp; I have had some situations where eth0 comes up when netbooting but when NAND booting, but I think this may be a more complex configuration.&nbsp; The networking patches to handle the Gig ethernet are definitely already in the trunk, so the issue is more than likely the continued lack of support for the bridge.</p><p>rabinnh</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks a LOT, I plan to use RG450G for my upcoming OpenWRT based project.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I will be not so optimistic about stable MicroSD support for all cards:</p><p>First will be interesting to know if MicroSD connection in RB450G is done by SPI same way as some others Microtik boards:</p><p>&quot;MicroSD slot on the RB-493AH is not yet supported under OpenWrt. The slot shares the AR71xx&#039;s SPI bus with the NAND and with the NOR flash, and the linux mmc_spi driver does not work with a shared SPI bus currently.&quot; ???</p><p>Note: Seeing in you previous message SPI patches, answers will be probably YES</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------</p><p>On Microtik forum is several messages about unstable MicroSD behaviour, for RB450G looks also a newer SDHC cards are better supported.</p><p>There is a list of User Tested MicroSD cards for RB450G and:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Supported_Hardware#Memory_cards">http://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Supported â€¦ mory_cards</a></p><p>Note: Pushing the &quot;Kingston SDHC 8GB card&quot; all the way into the socket caused the card not to work properly! It had to be pulled out ~1mm for it to work!</p><p>===============================</p><p>I have a RB450G board and brand new Kingston 2GB MicroSD (SD-C02G Taiwan SDC/2G 81) Very small number under MicroSd said 0947RB0651H (Similar card from Jappan&nbsp; is reported to do not work on Mikrotik :-)<br />I have already use for this 2GB card, so I will try to get tomorrow one of the new Micro SDHC 4GB Class 6 card (non mobile edition) for about $10</p><p>I can test a devel image with MicroSD support, preferable is one with integrated root for simple netboot test (I have a serial cable connection no need for working network support)</p><p>===============================</p><p>Here are notes from related microtik forum threads:</p><p>RB450G+microSD=errors - help<br /><a href="http://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=31325">http://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=31325</a></p><p>RB450G microSD card issue<br /><a href="http://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=36459">http://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=36459</a></p><p>450G + MicroSD<br /><a href="http://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=39390">http://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=39390</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>natiku</strong> on 5 May 2010, 23:09)</p>

					<p>@bradyzhu: Information regarding OpenWrt on RB450G, is very sparse at best.&nbsp; Common scenario, it&#039;s outdated and possibly worse than irrelevant.&nbsp; The irrelevant information literally drowns out that sliver which *might* exist.&nbsp; So if you compiled your image, please provide the .config.&nbsp; AND possibly even the compiled images, but the .config is priority.&nbsp; If you just used a pre-compiled image, which one did you use?&nbsp; I can only speak for myself, but I&#039;ve had this router for almost a year now... still not using it, still no OpenWRT.&nbsp; suffice it to say, I desperately need the help and would really appreciate it.&nbsp; This also goes out for anyone who possibly can help.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>techzilla</strong> on 9 Mar 2012, 09:34)</p>

					<p>I wasn&#039;t even sure how covered the RB450G was. I may very well buy one soon. If I do I will try and help with the setup of it. Seems like one of the most powerful routers out there, though it&#039;s too bad it doesn&#039;t have mini-pci ports.</p>									</div>

					<p>@napierzaza: That&#039;s why its so painful, the RB450G is such a powerful router and it&#039;s reasonably priced.&nbsp; We should be able to get openwrt running on it, there exists people who have.&nbsp; The Issue is accessibility of relevant information, either you need documentation&nbsp; or very strong embedded Linux fundamentals.&nbsp; &nbsp;You can try to develop those fundamentals, but you can&#039;t expect every project will yield a workable solution.&nbsp; &nbsp;Put it this way... I&#039;m not a technically incompetent person, for gods sake I&#039;m a Linux Systems Administrator.&nbsp; That&#039;s not a hobby either, It&#039;s my profession.&nbsp; Yet I still jumped into water that was too deep, I must have forgotten the pain of Linux circa `99.&nbsp; &nbsp;Basically OpenWRT is great, it runs without too much trouble on *SPECIFIC* hardware.&nbsp; If you have SOLID experience, its great buy, same if you want a cool project.&nbsp; Its much more complicated than a well documented broadcom, or Atheros redboot, installation.</p>									</div>
