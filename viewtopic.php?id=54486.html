					<p>So I&#039;ve recently bought a tiny and 10 USD cheap WiFi repeater off Ali... To my surprise the manual (also surprisingly well-written) mentioned the firmware being GNU GPL and LGPL covered. Unsurprisingly the follow up text was all about weaseling itself out again, and the supposed vendor (<a href="http://www.szgeeya.com/">http://www.szgeeya.com/</a>) doesn&#039;t provide any sort of relevant downloads.</p><p>And yes of course. I&#039;m asking if it matches with any already supported hardware perhaps. My particular model is called &quot;<strong>Geeya R303</strong>&quot;. From googling the firmware number thingy &quot;MRE2-B1.344.0.20131012&quot; it seems there are quite a few rebranded variants of that. Possibly most of the <a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/popular/rtl8196e.html">RTL8196E wifi repeaters on Ali..</a> might be comparable here.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/G3F7VGp.jpgh" alt="RTL8196E_Geeya_R303" /></span></p><p>So apparently it&#039;s made up of:<br /></p><ul><li><p><strong>M12L128168A</strong> 2Mx16x4 dram</p></li><li><p><strong>RTL8196E</strong> D8L26P4 SoC</p></li><li><p><strong>RTL8192ER</strong> D8J79E1 wireless </p></li><li><p>&quot;100 E2532W81 C008B 1302&quot; (no idea)</p></li><li><p>2x <strong>D12301G</strong> for the ethernet ports</p></li><li><p>There&#039;s an onboard label of &quot;WN523N2-B2&quot; while the case sticker names the whole device GNY-R303 Rev. B2, and a S/N of GNY303135....</p></li></ul><p>There seemingly might even be a serial port prepared next to the DRAM chip.&nbsp; But I haven&#039;t really tinkered with anything yet.</p><p>So. What&#039;s the state of the <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=46606">RTL8196xy support</a>? I realize it&#039;s not as useful of a target device, with just 16MB ram, and no idea how little flash memory, plus no extensibility whatsoever. But if any of the developers might be interested, Christmas is almost upon us, and these things are cheap enough to offer one or two..</p>									</div>

					<p>@mk24 Thanks! I wasn&#039;t sure about the tinier one, albeit seen similar chip formats mentioned as flash in other board photos. 4MB isn&#039;t much, and with 16MB ram I can certainly rule out IPv6 support then. (OTOH to be expected, these repeaters/routers are <em>really</em> dwarfish.)</p><p>Turns out the original vendor is easy to uncover when searching for the board make &quot;WR532N2&quot;, and they seemingly even had some kernel code / SDK ready: <a href="http://www.win-star.com/eshop/article.php?id=46">http://www.win-star.com/eshop/article.php?id=46</a>; <strong>broken link</strong> though for mine.</p><p>I&#039;ve even found an off-site discussion of the similar Rev.A board <a href="http://blog.friedzombie.com/ws-wn523n2-wl1369-rev-a-deconstruction/">http://blog.friedzombie.com/ws-wn523n2- … struction/</a>. Same serial port obviously; not sure about the relevany or what to make of the <a href="http://sprunge.us/QCXJ">boot log</a>.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>prof_milki</strong> on 9 Dec 2014, 23:33)</p>
