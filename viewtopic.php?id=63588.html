					<p>Hello there!<br />After several years without OpenWrt I&#039;m back: Using a TP-Link Archer C7 v2.0 (aka AC1750) with the latest release from last week OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05.1. For about ten days I was using OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05 before.</p><p>The described issue was there at 15.05, too, but I wanted to test 15.05.1 to see if &quot;my bug&quot; got fixed. So it&#039;s not, it&#039;s still there.</p><p>About the issue:<br />My 5ghz wifi is running in 802.11ac mode, auto channel, 40 Mhz channel width, 100mW transmition power as access point with wpa2-psk aes/ccmp and country code DE (Germany).</p><p>When connecting to the wifi everything is fine (got a Nexus 5 and a Nexus 5X Android smartphone). After a while, just a few minutes, on the table, the phones seem to lose their connection. Getting them back from &quot;sleep mode&quot; both phones show the configured wifi, but they do not connect until I tap it, but they do show the wifi as &quot;saved&quot;.</p><p>This issue doesn&#039;t show up on the second wifi I got running at 2.4ghz 802.11n. They stay connected even in &quot;sleep mode&quot; on the smartphones.</p><p>The last try days I tinkered a little with channel width and 802.11n mode on 5ghz, but the issue doesn&#039;t go away.</p><p>Do you have any advice for debugging? I want to exclude smartphone misconfiguration - but software bugs still possible ;-).</p><p>Best regards<br />ocram</p>									</div>

					<p>I have an Archer C7 v2 as well, running Chaos Calmer. My wife recently got a Nexus 5X and she complained about connectivity issues, too. I had looked into it, but didn&#039;t find anything I could change on the router&#039;s end to avoid that. Wifi problems with the Nexus 5X seem to be rather common, though, according to various reports on the web.</p><p>The problem always occured when the Nexus woke up from sleep mode. The workaround was to reboot the Nexus and then it worked again for a while. However - and that is the good news (at least for my wife) - last week or so, she installed the latest OTA update for her phone and after that, the issue seems to have been resolved. She doesn&#039;t experience any connectivity problems anymore.</p>									</div>
