					<p>Dear All,</p><p>The device which I have is Canyon CN-WF514 router which uses RTL8186 chip (mips processor) with 16 MB of RAM.</p><p>Currently I have a linux kernel 2.4 with embedded rootfs which is residing in the RAM disk. I would like to convert that approach to use linux kernel 2.4 with embedded squashfs root file system.</p><p>The kernel is already patched to deal with squashfs.</p><p>Does anybody have an experience how to build squashfs root file system (ie. which options should be used for mksquashfs program) and how to embedded it to linux kernel (how to configure the kernel).</p><p>Does the squashfs have to reside in the RAM disk or it could be somehow &#039;mounted&#039; directly form the Kernel?</p><p>I will appreciate any answer on that</p><p>Best Regards</p><p>Mirek</p>									</div>
