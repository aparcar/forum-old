Like RangerZ I open several threads at once, but if I need to check the topic I just highlight some text where I&#039;m at on the screen, press Home to go to top and look at the topic, and quickly scroll down to where the highlight is (highlighting just because it&#039;s easy to spot while scrolling, no other particular reason).</p><p>I don&#039;t mind keeping it if the size is reduced, and a less prominent font color (i.e. grey) is used. It would also work well to put it next to the time of post, could be e.g.:<br /><span style="color: #00579c">Today 01:22:35</span> <span style="color: #999">Re: Forum changes since the recent server-update</span></p><p>Also as mentioned, the team probably needs some time to sort out all the changes. I don&#039;t mean to say this is urgent, take your time. Great to have a new server anyway. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makro</strong> on 25 Feb 2016, 01:54)</p>

					<p>I don&#039;t mind the issue tmo26 brought up, and while I find the new theme more modern and visually appealing, the default font seems to be smaller/thinner so it&#039;s harder to read for my aging eyes. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>
