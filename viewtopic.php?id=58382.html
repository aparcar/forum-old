					<p>Hi Everyone,</p><p>I have the following router:<br />Router Model: Dlink-DIR-868L rev. B1<br />CPU Model: ARMv7 Processor rev 0 (v7l)&nbsp; </p><p>I&#039;m a newbie when it comes to OpenWrt and don&#039;t know what to download for this router model and how to install. The supported hardware list and download list do not show this specific model. In fact, I can not find anything related to DIR-868L.</p><p>What I would like to accomplish is:<br />- Running DHCPmasq/DNSmasq (or similar) running as a forwarding DNS server with automatic updates from DHCP.<br />- Being able to mount a 64-gig USB stick for sharing some files <br />- Scheduling for the wifi radio&#039;s<br />- Reduce the transmit power of the wifi radio&#039;s<br />- SSL-type of VPN (alternatively the OpenVPN client)</p><p>I tried DD-WRT but running into some issues. For those who are interested in the details: <br /><a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=973380&amp;highlight=#973380">http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic. â€¦ ht=#973380</a></p><p>Anyone out there that is able to point me in the right direction?</p><br /><p>Thank you - Will</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>NogNeetMachinaal</strong> on 8 Jul 2015, 09:30)</p>
