					<p>Hi there,</p><p>before I start, could someone please try to &quot;playback&quot; an MP3 on a kirkwood target (no soundcard required):</p><p>gst-launch-1.0&nbsp; filesrc location=file.mp3 ! id3demux ! fakesink -t</p><p>required packages: gstreamer1-utils, gst1-mod-id3demux, gst1-mod-typefindfunctions</p><br /><p>I have been trying this for some time now, compiling different versions of gstreamer and always getting the same errors.</p><p>ERROR: from element /GstPlayBin:playbin0/GstURIDecodeBin:uridecodebin0/GstDecodeBin:decodebin0/GstID3Demux:id3demux0: Could not detect type of contents</p><p>Running with some more verbose debug output (--gst-debug=&quot;*:4&quot;) I could see that gsttypefindfunctions.c did not correctly identify the MP3 after the third header. I then modified the source to only check the first two headers (five would be normally required).<br />Now there is a problem with mpegaudioparse complaining about invalid bitrate, samplerate, etc.</p><p>I suspect this to be some kind of endianness problem - unfortunately I am no C programmer at all, therefore I have no idea what to do next in order to fix this... <br />I am crosscompiling on x86_64 - but so is the openwrt buildbot I guess.</p><p>Alex</p><p>PS: I compiled various versions of Gstreamer; v1.2.4 on my debian wheezy (ppc) works fine</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry, if I haven&#039;t been more clear the first time...</p><p>In my opinion the Gstreamer packages for Kirkwood are faulty starting with Chaos Calmer and they still are with Trunk.<br />I used the ones compiled by the buildbot as well as my own (different versions, all running fine on AR71xx)</p><p>I opened a ticket with the Gstreamer guys at Gnome:<br /><a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=762224">https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=762224</a></p><p>Unfortunately this is a show stopper while trying to run a new upnp/dlna renderer on my Pogoplug E02.</p><br /><p>Now is the code faulty (in regards to cross-compiling for a different architecture), or are some of the cross-compiling arguments set wrong?</p>									</div>
