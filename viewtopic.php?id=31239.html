					<p>Hi!</p><p>Today my network has two routers WR1043ND. One (openwrt) plugged into the cable modem and other (original firmware and I can not change it) plugged in the first one, two different WLANs. </p><p>I am buying a server for tests and learning and I am thinking to buy another WR1043ND (and install openwrt) to connect in the first router through a WDS, in a way that the server wil be connected by wire and the network will still have two WLANs.</p><p>I want something like the follow figure:</p><p><a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/543/homenetwork.jpg/"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://img543.imageshack.us/img543/1802/homenetwork.jpg" alt="http://img543.imageshack.us/img543/1802/homenetwork.jpg" /></span></a></p><p>Uploaded with <a href="http://imageshack.us">ImageShack.us</a></p><p>Is that possible with openwrt? Mind that I am planning to use all the five ports of the new router, one to the firewall, other from the firewall and the other three under the firewall. The WLAN2 needs to be under the firewall too.</p><p>Obs.: the server will have three network interfaces and various virtual machines.</p><p>Thanks in advanced!</p><p>Best Regards,<br />Rodrigo.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rodpp</strong> on 7 Aug 2011, 09:31)</p>

					<p>I figured out that connecting the server to WAN by a wireless interface isn&#039;t a good idea. First because missing certified drivers for the server, and if I need to test a WoL it is only possible through a wired connection. And the price of one wireless interface is greater that the price of one WR1043ND. Maybe the best option is to use two WR1043ND, one before the server doing the WDS connection and other after the server receiving the signal from the proxy and broadcasting it.</p>									</div>
