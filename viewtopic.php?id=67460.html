					<p>Hello,</p><p>Coming from an old Linksys WRT54GL, I decided to upgrade and got a brand new<br />Linksys WRT1200AC.</p><p>The WRT54GL had a pretty standard configuration: one mac filtered wifi SSID<br />bridged with the LAN.</p><p>I already configured my WRT1200AC so that the LAN is split into VLAN1 and VLAN2.<br />Consider VLAN2 as unused.</p><p>I would like to have two wifi SSID: WifiGuest as a standalone network<br />and WifiTrust that would allow client devices to be on VLAN1 (same function<br />than the wifi configured on the WRT54GL).<br />Since the WRT1200AC has two wifi devices, I wondered what would be the best<br />solution:</p><p>1/ no bridge, each wifi device with its exclusive network: <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- 2.4Ghz for WifiGuest,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- 5Ghz for WifiTrust, bridged with VLAN1</p><p>2/ bridge both wifi devices so that client devices can connect to whatever band<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;they are compatible with.</p><p>Since my network and routing skills have a lot of space for improvements, I<br />would like some enlightenments.</p><p>Solution 1 is pretty simple, but doesn&#039;t seem optimal.</p><p>is solution 2 even possible ?<br />Should I then create WifiGuest and WifiTrust SSIDs for both device and associate<br />the two WifiTrust SSIDs with VLAN1 ?</p><p>Is there a real benefit to bridge the two wifi devices ?</p><p>Thanks for your inputs.</p>									</div>

					<p>As a newbie it&#039;s unclear what you know and have read here so far, so please try to consult the wiki and search the forum first.</p><p>The wiki should have brought you to this article.&nbsp; <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan?s">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan?s</a>[]=guest&amp;s[]=network</p><p>I do not own this or another dual band router on OpenWrt, so I can not comment on what is &quot;bridged&quot;, but expect that the LAN and both wireless are so in default.&nbsp; The above link indicates you can create a Guest LAN without the need for VLANs on the primary router.&nbsp; The article is not specific to a dual band router, but I suspect you would need to create a wireless connection attached to the interface WifiGuest for each band.</p><p>Regarding your last question, the reason to bridge the interfaces is to be able to share across them, and this is generally desired in a home LAN.</p><p>Welcome to OpenWrt</p>									</div>

					<p>Not really a newbie here: I started openwrt with whiterussian <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />It happens that I&#039;ve waited until today to create an account: no need before since my WRT54GL was not really happy with anything above Kamikaze.</p><p>I already went through the guest-wlan wiki page, but as you noticed, it did not talk about dual band router specifics.</p><p>While waiting for an answer, I experimented a bit and created WifiGuest and WifiTrust SSIDs in both device, associating them in their related interface, respectively WifiGuestInterface&nbsp; and LanTrustedInterface.</p><p>It seems to be a good solution, but I don&#039;t know if this is THE right solution.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Regarding your last question, the reason to bridge the interfaces is to be able to share across them, and this is generally desired in a home LAN.</p></blockquote></div><p>I&#039;m aware of this, my question was more about the specificity of bridging 2 wifi devices: I thought , apparently wrongfully, that bridging would be sufficient to create one SSID shared by both devices. Instead I should create the same SSID on both device and include them in the same interface.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Welcome to OpenWrt</p></blockquote></div><p>Thanks <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
