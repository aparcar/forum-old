					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;m considering moving to a VDSL2 connection and am looking for a supported device. I&#039;d appreciate input on the following questions:</p><p>1) Are there any supported VDSL2 modem/routers? The wiki and forum seem to suggest no, but I&#039;d love to be wrong about this. Support would need to include VLANs on the WAN side, as I wish to be able to run a VOIP phone and the providers here do this through VLANs.</p><p>2) If there are no supported devices, my next choice would be to bridge a VDSL2 device (with native firmware) to an OpenWRT wired router. Anything obviously wrong with this idea? Subpoints:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;a) Need to maintain VLANs on WAN on bridged device. Is this likely to be possible? (I don&#039;t see why not). <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;b) Recommended&nbsp; devices for bridging in this way?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;c) Recommended hardware for the downstream OpenWRT router? Would prefer wired only.</p><p>Thanks everyone!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>conn-fused</strong> on 26 Jun 2013, 07:04)</p>

					<p>Had the same issue, ISP provider a zyxel router wmg1312 and wouldn&#039;t even consider me using something else (spectrum Internet - local project to to FTTC).&nbsp; Anyway, now using that to route to my openwrt box, which is now a pure router - no nat, having disabled the wireless on the zytel.&nbsp; </p><p>Works fine, zyxel&#039;s not as flexible, but fine for this job.</p><p>I don&#039;t actually think there are any vdsl openwrt options anyway, and I haven&#039;t found any modems either (used to have a vigor 120 for adsl which was perfect).&nbsp; </p><p>Anyway, vdsl gives me 60mbs down and 20mbs up, so I&#039;m willing to ignore the other issues!</p><p>Paul</p>									</div>

					<p>At least Lantiq, Broadcom, Conexant and Ikanos have VDSL2-IP in their product portfolios. Given that companies attitude it seems very unlikely that there ever will be FOSS drivers for the Broadcom DSL-solution. The same seems true for Ikanos. Their IP is used in some of the newer Fritz!Boxes. You find some details in <a href="http://www.wehavemorefun.de/fritzbox/AVM_Wiki">http://www.wehavemorefun.de/fritzbox/AVM_Wiki</a> but it is in german language only.</p><p>Lantiq xDSL-IP:<br />ADLS2+-drivers are available and integrated in OpenWrt, or even mainlined, dunno.<br />VDSL2-drivers&nbsp; were announced in July 2012: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=173561#p173561">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php â€¦ 61#p173561</a> in this forum.</p><p>Here is some kind of an overview: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/soc/soc.lantiq">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/soc/soc.lantiq</a></p>									</div>

I am not able to recommend a switch!<br />&nbsp; a) of course<br />&nbsp; b) anything works, even your PC<br />&nbsp; c) not really. maybe a SoC with a MIPS 74K/74KE or a MIPS 34K CPU, since 24K/24KE are slower. Dunno how ARM CPUs competes with these. Marvell e.g. designs its own CPUs based on ARM Instruction set license. And the mainline support is quite messy at the moment.</p><p>I think more crucial than the CPU are the SoC-integrated Ethernet-MACs and the Switch. Can&#039;t recommend anything, but there is garbage out there in the sense, that it is not well supported by FOSS Linux drivers.</p><br /><p>My Questions:<br />Which VLAN-ID does your ISP employ? For Data, Management, VoIP adn IPTV. Are there more?</p>									</div>
