					<p>Hi, i&#039;m in need of a new router, and of course i&#039;d like to run openWRT on it.</p><p>Usage: home network, WAN connection sharing, transfers from any computer to a data storage (RAID5 array, i want the fastest transfer possible, cable AND wifi).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 5GHz wifi would be nice, i see a lot of devices having troubles with this, which ones can do it? (proprietary drivers?)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I also need a USB port so that i can put the WAN connection via USB tethering to my Android device.</p><p>From the supported hardware page, i&#039;ve selected those possible candidates:</p><p>_ TP-Link Archer (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/archer-c5-c7-wdr7500http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/archer-c5-c7-wdr7500">OpenWRT wiki</a>)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; C5 (<a href="http://www.materiel.net/routeur-adsl/tp-link-routeur-gigabit-archer-c5-ac1200-110363.html">seller page</a>)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; C7 (<a href="http://www.materiel.net/routeur-adsl/tp-link-routeur-gigabit-archer-c7-ac1750-94780.html">seller page</a>)</p><p>_ Netgear R6300 (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/netgear_r6300_v2">OpenWRT wiki</a>) (<a href="http://www.materiel.net/routeur-adsl/netgear-routeur-double-bande-802-11ac-r6300-79194.html">seller page</a>)</p><p>_ Netgear R7000 (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/r7000">OpenWRT wiki</a>) (<a href="http://www.materiel.net/routeur-adsl/netgear-routeur-wi-fi-ac1900-nighthawk-r7000-96455.html">seller page</a>) (is there a proprietary driver supported?)</p><p>_ Linksys WRT1200AC (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1200ac">OpenWRT wiki</a>) (<a href="http://www.materiel.net/routeur-adsl/linksys-routeur-wifi-gigabit-ac1200-wrt1200ac-115011.html">seller page</a>)</p><p>_ Linksys WRT1900AC (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1900ac">OpenWRT wiki</a>) (<a href="http://www.materiel.net/routeur-adsl/linksys-routeur-gigabit-ac1900-wrt1900ac-102387.html">seller page</a>)</p><p>I have no trouble compiling anything necessary to get the device working, i&#039;m well used to compiling stuff (i&#039;m a developper myself), but i don&#039;t want to spend months debugging/modifying code to get it working (i need it fast, my old router is dead).</p><p>The Linksys looks great, but a bit expensive.<br />The TP-Link would be my next choice (price), depending on the version i can get.<br />The Netgear would come next, is there a way to get the wifi working? (proprietary drivers?)</p><p>Can anyone please give me some advices on those devices? (what works, what doesn&#039;t, do you have one? is it good?)</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>The OpenWRT Wiki should answer all of your questions.&nbsp; </p><p>Any router that uses a Broadcom chipset will have spotty wireless support at best.&nbsp; For example, the Netgear R7000 has <strong><span class="bbu">no</span></strong> wireless support now because there is no open source driver available for that Broadcom chipset.&nbsp; Similarly, the Netgear R6300 only supports 802.11 b/g.&nbsp; Other routers that use Broadcom chipsets have similar issues unless they are older hardware supported by the bcm43 Linux driver.</p><p>Broadcom does make a proprietary binary Linux driver available, which is how DD-WRT is able to support these routers.&nbsp; However, I understand that this driver is compiled for use with much older versions of the Linux kernel (i.e. 2.6.something) which uses a different ABI than the more current kernel version used by OpenWRT.&nbsp; For this technical reason, it&#039;s unlikely to see the Broadcom driver incorporated into the OpenWRT mainline soon.&nbsp; OpenWRT also prefers to avoid closed-source drivers, so even if Broadcom recompiled the binary drivers to support the more current Linux kernel ABI, I doubt it would be incorporated.</p><p>For those reasons, I would steer clear of the Netgear&#039;s at this time if you want to run OpenWRT.&nbsp; If you can find version 2.0 of the TP-Link Archer C7, I would go with that because it appears to be the best supported at this time.&nbsp; The Linksys WRT1200AC and Linksys WRT1900AC are supported, but those builds still appear to be a work in progress from the forum threads.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rajl</strong> on 2 Oct 2015, 17:23)</p>

					<p>Thanks for your answer.</p><p>From what i understand, the dev on the Linksys is going fast, but since i need a router that works right now, maybe i&#039;d better avoid those (and they are expensive too).</p><p>So the Archer C7 seems to be the best for me, if i can get a v2, which i can&#039;t know from the reseller page, i just hope they&#039;ll be kind enough to provide me this information if i ask.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have TP-Link TL-WDR4900v1.3 and Netgear WNDR3700v2 and have installed OpenWrt Barrier Breaker 14.07 on both of them.<br />Regarding 5GHz, TP-Link is more reliable than Netgear which fails to enable 5GHz Wifi most of the times. To be honest I didn&#039;t dig into it enough to find a solution for Netgear but the point is on TP-Link everything just worked once OpenWrt was installed.<br />Hope this helps and please let me know if you need more information on these routers.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes i have. As i said, that&#039;s how i made my selection of candidates.<br />Still, i had some questions, which were answered by rajl (broadcom wifi is not a good idea, proprietary drivers are not supported by openWRT).<br />Then, having advices from users who actually tried the product is always good before buying.</p>									</div>

Imho all new models that suppose USB 3.0 are at least Dual Core ARM`s which i think is sufficient for USB 3.0.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>IngoPan</strong> on 10 Dec 2015, 13:07)</p>
