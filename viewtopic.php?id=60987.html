					<p>I have a TP-Link TL-WR1043ND which has 4 ethnet and 1 WAN connections at the back plus Wifi. When I connect to it by ethernet cable DNS lookup works. This is from my laptop and a Raspberry Pi I use for torrents. But suddenly I can&#039;t look up DNS on the Wifi connection, which is driving me nuts!</p><p>If I connect by Wifi and try to go to bing.com I have no luck. But when I use the ip for bing.com I connect no problem.</p><p>I wonder how I might have cocked this up.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;d start by posting the network, wifi, dhcp and firewall configs along with the /etc/firewall.user file if you have it. Maybe there&#039;re people who can figure out your problem without all that information, but why make it harder?</p>									</div>
