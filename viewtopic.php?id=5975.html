					<p>Hi, </p><p>i tried rc5 in asus wl500g with configuration br0 (eth0 + eth2) and wan (eth1).<br />wifi is used in G mode</p><p>br0 = 192.168.150.0/24<br />wan = 192.168.2.0/24 (backbone)</p><p>example:<br />When anything is downloaded through wan port (server is connected to wan port via cable) with full possible speed , wan port dies in a few seconds (sometime works longer, but no longer then 30s). When wan port die, i must do ifup wan manualy. Doesn&#039;t matter if data goes to eth0 or eth2.<br />Same feature is when eth0 and eth2 is separated to subnets.</p><p>On same machine but with rc4 it works better, communication is just broken for a few seconds and then continue. WAN port doesn&#039;t die.</p><p>Have someone same experience and how ..... ?</p><p>regards</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>reset</strong> on 4 Jun 2006, 20:08)</p>

					<p>yesterday, i made a few tests and reconfiguration of devices (all other configuration, ie. iptables, arptables and other packages was not changed),</p><p>when eth1 + eth2 is bridged together and eth0 is separated, RC4 takes less system sources and communication is not broken, RC5 take more, comminication is slower in both ways and in short time the device eth1 is disconected!! </p><p>Bridged eth1 + eth2 is better than eth0 + eth2 in both firmwares (RC4, RC5) - better performance</p><p>I thing, that something in RC5 firmware sucks comminication.</p><p>Because the stability and good performence of routers is very important for me, I cannot switch to RC5 firmware, will fucks my network.</p><p><a href="http://ernetfree.net/mapa_site/mapa.jpg">http://ernetfree.net/mapa_site/mapa.jpg</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>reset</strong> on 5 Jun 2006, 11:51)</p>

					<p>i&#039;m not sure if my explanation is enough for you. <br />Ask me for more details, if it&#039;s interested for you. <br />I can make more tests and help. <br />My network is my hobby (programming, networking, ... computers, comunication)</p>									</div>

					<p>rc4 was still using the ethernet driver from broadcom; rc5 switched to the b44 driver (GPL). Therefore it&#039;s indeed possible that&nbsp; you experienced better performance on rc4.<br />The problem with eth1 dying should have been already resolved when rc5 was released - see <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/tags/whiterussian_rc5/openwrt/target/linux/linux-2.4/patches/brcm">https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/tags/wh â€¦ tches/brcm</a>. So probably reopening ticket #314 (<a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/314">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/314</a>) would be a good idea.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wtzm</strong> on 5 Jun 2006, 13:32)</p>

					<p>The patches are already included in rc5, so the wan port problem shouldn&#039;t really occur... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> I&#039;m sorry that I can&#039;t do any tests on my own wl-500g, because it&#039;s currently involved in mission critical operations (well, it&#039;s managing my internet connection ^^).<br />You can report this problem at <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/314">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/314</a> and one of the developers will hopefully resolve it.</p>									</div>
