					<p>I need to setup a &quot;kind of&quot; wifi repeater. That is a wifi client providing connectivity through wifi.<br />I could stick an USB dongle into one of my WR1043, but the dongle concept is not optimal in my case.<br />I&#039;ve done this (well a repeater bridge, actually)&nbsp; with DD-WRT and a WRT610Nv1 which is running fine in another setup.<br />What&#039;d be a good choice to reliably run OpenWRT?<br />TIA.</p>									</div>

					<p>You don&#039;t need a second radio for this, unless you want the repeated network to be on a different channel. All hardware I know will happily run a STA and on or more APs on the same phy. The tricky part is bridging (to make the repeater transparent as opposed to creating a new, routed subnet), which is an entirely separate problem.<br />The primary solution for that would be WDS, which has several different, incompatible implementations - so this depends on the hardware of your main AP. I&#039;m using a bunch of Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NHs (and a WZR-HP-AG300H for 5GHz) for this purpose and I&#039;m very happy with them.</p>									</div>

					<p>Both <strong>hus</strong> and <strong>johan666</strong> are right. At a certain extent.<br />On my test box (TL-WR2543) <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=175185#p175185">it&#039;s working</a> since a few hours thanks to a trunk build.<br />Previous installations led to non working setups.</p><p>At least in my case, dual WNIC are preferrable by far because:<br />1. Client WNIC will get a directional antenna, while the master one will use a hi gain omni directional stick<br />2. Client WNIC will have the maximum TX power, while the other one will not<br />3. Client WNIC will need to match a specific channel, while it&#039;s desirable the master one&nbsp; goes the &quot;auto&quot; way</p><p>Your feedbacks are valuable anyway.</p>									</div>

It uses only 1.5W so the powerconsumption wouldn&#039;t be an issue. And you could locate it away from the AP and shorten the antennacables (if that is an issue).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 20 Aug 2012, 21:03)</p>

					<p>I didn&#039;t test r33212 or 33053 but I patched wpa_supplicant.sh myself and added exactly the same 2 lines as in changeset 33053 to a slightly older revision which suffered this problem (it was mentioned in the bugreport), and it worked after that.&nbsp; <br />wpa_supplicant.sh wasn&#039;t changed since r33053 so I&#039;m quite sure it&#039;s still working.

					<p>I just said that there isn&#039;t just one problem, there are (at least) 2 different problem, probably introduced at the same time, one is fixed (the bug the thread you refered to is about). And there is another behavouir (which has nothing to do with the other thread) which is marked as &quot;won&#039;t fix&quot; by a developer, and it won&#039;t be fixed because it&#039;s the normal behavouir of wpa_supplicant (now?), and probably a lot of changes to the upstreamcode are needed to keep the AP up and running if the remote AP goes down. But I don&#039;t know the reasons, so I wrote I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; The point is that you have see it differentiated, or you end up saying &quot;openwrt, isn&#039;t working&quot;, or &quot;the internet is broken&quot;. </p><p>But the OP needs a setup with 2 physical interfaces, regardless of a fix for this 2nd problem.
