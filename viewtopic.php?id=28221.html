					<p>Hi All,<br />I would very much like to mod my Dlink WBR-1310 D1 by replacing the current 2Mb flash chip (Spansion 29F016) with something compatible with that has at least 4Mb and is inexpensive.</p><p>I&#039;ve read elsewhere that you should use the Spansion 29F032, however I don&#039;t believe it is still being made (I did call around and one store said it cost $16, but upon further consideration they may have confused this with a different 32Mb chip with a similar sounding name).</p><p>Any recommendations?</p><p>I welcome your input.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>neoveo</strong> on 20 Jan 2011, 08:04)</p>

However, I have a hunch its RAM size is no more than 32MB. That said, I am not sure if I want to waste $16 + some valuable time on soldering to just replace the Flash to a 32MB. If you can still find and get an inexpensive Seagate <a href="http://www.seagate.com/www/en-us/products/network_storage/freeagent_dockstar">DockStar</a> with a Marvell Kirkwood ARM5 CPU clocked @1.2GHz, 128/256 MB RAM/NAND, 4 USB2 ports, and 1 10/100/1000 Mbps Rj45 port to run OpenWRT, this may be a better deal. Last year, a lot of us got our inexpensive Seagate <a href="http://www.seagate.com/www/en-us/products/network_storage/freeagent_dockstar">DockStar</a> device for less than $20. Anyway, add a 3G / 4G WiFi USB dongle (and a 4-port gIGE switch) to one of its USB ports, the device can be easily turned into a 3G / 4G WiFi NAT/Firewall router. With a 128MB RAM and virtually unlimited space through some external USB storages, this self-concocted 3G / 4G WiFi NAT/Firewall router can also be used as a server to host a lot of services, i.e. <a href="http://asterisk.org">Asterisk</a>, <a href="http://freeswitch.org">FreeSWITCH</a>, etc., for private use. I have my Seagate <a href="http://www.seagate.com/www/en-us/products/network_storage/freeagent_dockstar">DockStar</a> running on a self-built OpenWRT with <a href="http://freeswitch.org">FreeSWITCH</a> and it is connected behind my main NAT/Firewall router. Just my 2Â¢.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Mazilo,<br />Small world, it&#039;s good to see a familiar face here.</p><p>I am just looking for a small fun project to do, I&#039;ve explained it in this thread:</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=28188">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=28188</a></p><br /><p>I think you are confusing RAM with Flash Ram.<br />The WBR-1310 has only 2Mb Flash Ram (not enough for OpenWrt) and 16 Mb RAM.</p><p>If I can find an inexpensive Flash Chip that will give me 4Mb of room to put OpenWrt on it then I&#039;ll do - just for the fun of it all.</p><p>I did look at the Dockstar, it looks great and I really like the mod you&#039;ve done, however I cannot find it anywhere for less than $40.</p><p>I am hoping to keep my budget for this fun project at around $10 all in (I think I already have most of the parts required to build the Jtag cable, already have the router, just need a Flash chip).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>neoveo</strong> on 20 Jan 2011, 16:57)</p>
