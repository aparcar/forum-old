					<p>First, an image of what I want to achieve:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://img2.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/72dbbf0fba.png" alt="http://img2.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/72dbbf0fba.png" /></span><br /><a href="http://img2.freeimagehosting.net/image.php?72dbbf0fba.png">http://img2.freeimagehosting.net/image. â€¦ bf0fba.png</a></p><br /><p>To clarify it:<br />-I connect to Internet with a cable-modem (no routing capabilities).<br />-The cable-modem Ethernet interface offers an IP from my ISP via DHCP.</p><p>My idea is to connect the Fonera to the cable-modem through the Ethernet interface. The Fonera should get the IP of the Ethernet interface from my ISP via DHCP.<br />Also, the Fonera will have the Wifi interface enabled in order to let other clients to connect internet via Wifi.<br />-The Fonera Wifi interface will have the static IP 192.168.0.1 and will act as an WPA-PSK AP.<br />-All the clients than want to connect to Internet should use the Wifi interface, which will get an IP like 192.168.0.x, obtained from a DHCP server running in the Fonera.</p><p>The first question is obvious,<br />is it possible to achieve this or there is a limitation in the Fonera or OpenWrt? is my scheme correct or I misunderstood something?</p><br /><p>If it is possible:<br />-Would I need to create a bridge? In which interfaces?What package should I install?<br />-What package should I install to have a DHCP server in the Fonera?<br />-What package should I install in order to configure the Fonera as an WPA-PSK AP? hostapd may be? or hostapd-mini?</p><p>I understand that to configure the Fonera&nbsp; I probably have to edit only 3 files:&nbsp; /etc/config/dhcp, /etc/config/network and /etc/config/wireless. I also understand the basic syntaxis&nbsp; of these files but I have doubts in the theory concepts.</p><br /><p>Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Stolz</strong> on 23 Dec 2007, 19:02)</p>

					<p>Thanks for your answer <strong>PraysToPan.</strong></p><p>Now I have clarified the concepts, but I&#039;m having troubles taking it to practice. To make things easier, I have first tried with static IP on the lan-side, soy I&#039;ve disabled the DHCP server:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># /etc/init.d/dnsmasq stop
# /etc/init.d/dnsmasq disable</code></pre></div><p>Also I&#039;ve installed the full version of hostapd:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># ipkg update

    option ifname   lo
    option proto    static
    option ipaddr   127.0.0.1

I can&#039;t connect it either wireless nor wired.</p><p><span class="bbu">Wireles:</span>No essid is created, so I suppose something is wrong with the wireless setup. I&#039;ve read the docs over and over again, and I see no error.</p><p><span class="bbu">Wired:</span> Because I&#039;ve configured the ethernet interface to get the IP from my ISP via DHCP, I&#039;ve had to install a DHCP server in my laptop and connect la Fonera to it. The DHCP server is working, because log says Forera gets the IP 192.168.1.4, but when I try to use SSH, connection is refused:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># ssh 192.168.1.4
ssh: connect to host fonera port 22: Connection refused</code></pre></div><p>To ensure 192.168.1.4 belongs to the Fonera, I&#039;ve used ARP and nmap, and both confirm 192.168.1.4 belongs to Fonera, <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># nmap -sS -O -PI -PP -PM -PT -PS -PU 192.168.1.4 
Starting Nmap 4.20 ( http://insecure.org ) at 2007-12-24 16:06 CET
All 1697 scanned ports on fonera (192.168.1.4) are closed
MAC Address: 00:18:84:23:8A:80 (FON)
Device type: general purpose
Running: Linux 2.6.X
OS details: Linux 2.6.17.13 (Slackware 11.0, x86)
Network Distance: 1 hop</code></pre></div><p>so the question is...<br />Why the Fonera is not listening in the 22 port? Why the SSH server has been disabled? As far as I know, none of my previous config changes have nothing to do with the SSH server <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /></p><br /><p>I just want to use my Fonera as a standard router and all I&#039;ve gotten is a unresponsive device. I&#039;m reflashing now to restore default settings. Any help is still appreciated.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Stolz</strong> on 24 Dec 2007, 17:23)</p>

					<p>It is possible to setup such a network configuration with the Fonera.</p><p>By default the LAN and WiFi is bridged to br-lan on the Fonera. You have to do:</p><p>1. Flash and login over the LAN port and configure wireless and make sure wireless is working.<br />2. Connect over wireless and remove the LAN port from the bridge and reconfigure the LAN as a WAN port. See Wiki: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Fon/Fonera#head-815862c048b5afb622a10ff938347f4eabdce71c">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har â€¦ 4eabdce71c</a></p><p>From now on you can only connect over wireless to the Fonera. You have been warned!</p><p>Since failsafe mode on the Fonera with Kamikaze 7.09 (fixed in trunk) does not work you have to reflash using the RedBoot console and start configuring from scratch again.</p>									</div>

					<p>in your config eth0 is the wan-port and on the wan-port the firewall is enabled and per default all incoming ports are blocked. so you have to open port 22 on the firewall. add &quot;accept:proto=tcp dport=22&quot; to you /etc/config/firewall and you should be able to login from the wan-side</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I reflashed the Fonera to get a fresh Kamikaze and repeated all the steps <strong>forum2006</strong> suggested, and it works like a charm <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />, thank you very much.</p><p>What I don&#039;t understand is why with <strong>forum2006</strong>&#039;s method it works and not with my steps.</p><p>My method: Connect via Ethernet, configure LAN and WAN, configure Wifi. Reboot<br />forum2006&#039;s method: Connect via Ethernet, configure Wifi. Connect via Wifi, configure LAN and WAN. Reboot</p><p>Both seems similar. Both finish with identical config files. The only difference is the order and that my method edits /etc/config/network directly but forum2006&#039;s uses <strong>uci</strong> command.</p><p>Does the order matter?<br />Does using <strong>uci</strong> instead of an editor matter?</p><p>Regards.</p>									</div>
