					<p>Would it be possible to change the default build of busy box to include the login and password management tools?&nbsp; It seems like too many packages need their own unprivileged user which is difficult to manage with out these tools.&nbsp; </p><p>Almost every release of White Russian I have to rebuild busybox to include these tools.&nbsp; Just the add/del user and group tools add a mere 10k.</p>									</div>

We would like to add some generic postinst/preremove <br />scripts for packages. Just haven&#039;t the time for it. Patches are welcome.</p>									</div>
