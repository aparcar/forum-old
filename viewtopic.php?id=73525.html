					<p>Hey</p><p>I have a WRTNode with OpenWRT (BarrierBreaker r41508) installed.<br />Today i wanted to attach a usb2TTL &quot;Sunfounder usb 2 serial ftdi&quot; board but it will not work. i see no output in dmesg that the board is attached. The Board uses an ftdi 232rl and works under windows und debian 9.</p><p>3w.sunfounder.com/3-3v-5v-ftdi232r-usb-to-ttl-serial-adapter-module(dot)html</p><p>I have another usb2serial adapter here. An original ftdi C232HD-DDHSP-0 with ft232H Chip inside which generates an working dmesg output and an serial usb device in /dev</p><p>If i connect this 3.3V Adapter i can see how the driver ist loaded and unloaded. Once the sunfounder board was connected usb1-1 and ftdi-sio 1-1:1.0 does not create any additional messages. So my idea is that the FT232RL chip is to new to the ftdi driver i have installed.</p><p>What do you think why the sunfounder usb2serial board is not recognized by my system?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hmm, i think the usb2serial board has only usb uhci support since it communicates only with fullspeed (12Mbps)</p><p>but the package kmod-usb-uhci is not available for me. Any suggestions how i can load usb full speed support into the kernel?</p><p>My Repository is d.wrtnode.com/packages/</p><p>Is it possible to load another one?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>daimonion</strong> on 13 Mar 2018, 00:46)</p>
