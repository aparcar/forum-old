					<p>For a project I&#039;m looking for an OpenWRT pro, who can setup a router with OpenWRT that redirects all network traffic through a VPN. Preferably you can also setup the VPN itself and maintain it.</p><p>This router is needed in order to hide the IP of any device connected to it. The router(s) that will be used is TP-Link WR1043ND. They are fully OpenWRT supported.</p><p>The setup can be done remotely via Teamviewer.<br />&nbsp; <br />If you are interested, send me a PM.<br />Tell me what your background (education, experience, etc) is and a cost estimation.</p><p>PS: It&#039;s quite hard to find someone knowledgeable in OpenWRT, so I&#039;m trying it this way. Please delete if the post is not appropriate here.</p>									</div>

					<p>@dror88<br />I am no expert on openwrt but I set up my router with such vpn.<br />I am using Aztech Hw550-3g router. In this router I set two wifi network 1-n/w connected to my dsl router with client config.<br />2- n/w works as Master mode (AP). then set up PPTP as vpn.<br />Now this router only need power onand no other wiring. It will connect to my dsl router using 1-wifi ssid as client then to PPTP VPN (commercial server in US or UK) and wait for clients to connect through its second ssid.</p><p>When any client device connect to 2nd ssid it will route all the traffic from client device via PPTP connection i.e. all my device connected to hw550 will always get routed through VPN and get US or UK IP!</p><p>Now, I am trying to get team-viewer on this router so that I can manage it from remote location.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dullu</strong> on 7 Jan 2015, 08:21)</p>
