					<p>I have a D-Link DSL 3780, an ADSL/VDSL router made for TalkTalk.&nbsp; On the General Discussions forum there is <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=286278">this topic</a>, containing plenty of information on it, most of which I hope is relevant.</p><p>The router already runs a distribution of Linux (TC Linux) which, on the face of it, makes it a good candidate to run OpenWRT.&nbsp; One of the replies within <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=286278">the thread</a> also contains a link to what seems to be the <a href="http://tsd.dlink.com.tw/downloads2008list.asp?OS=GPL"> router source code</a>.</p><p>I write code professionally (mainly in c#/asp.net) but I&#039;m a complete rookie when it comes to coding for embedded devices.&nbsp; So where do I go from here?&nbsp; Or should I just leave it to the pro&#039;s?&nbsp; :-)</p><p>Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>corruptor1972</strong> on 4 Jan 2016, 22:30)</p>
