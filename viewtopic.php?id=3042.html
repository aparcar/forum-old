					<p>The WAN port is no different than any other port another than it&#039;s on it&#039;s own VLAN and has different firewall (iptables) rules applied to it (which is why you probably can not ping it). Check out the firewall scripts (/etc/init.d/S45firewall).</p>									</div>

					<p>So what I hear you saying is, you want your WAN port to be just like all the other LAN ports so you have 5 LAN ports instead of 4 LAN ports and 1 WAN port? I assume you must have all 4 LAN ports used up and want to use the WAN port as a LAN port and you don&#039;t want to plug in another switch to one of the LAN ports? If so, all you have to do is change a couple of NVRAM variables but first. What is the model and version of your hardware and are you running RC3?</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I did not suggest you do what you did. What you have to do is pull the WAN port out of the WAN VLAN and put it into the LAN vlan. I am not familiar with the switch port layout on your hardware so I would have to do some research (or get a copy of your &quot;nvram show | sort&quot;) so I can see how it&#039;s layed out (that is, if you can get back into it). failsafe?</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t understand what you mean by &quot;I have already put a new version of firmware&quot;. You are able to upload firmware? Just so you know the WAN and LAN ports are all on the same internal ethernet interface. They are separated into VLANs on the switch which is how you can use them independently. I guess you&#039;ll have to stop by the &quot;I bricked my router&quot; thread and see if someone can help you there. Then come back here and post your &quot;nvram show | sort&quot; output.</p>									</div>

					<p>How long did you wait after booting? It sometimes takes quite a while for it to do it&#039;s thing after booting. Try connecting on all ports if you remember how you had them addressed (even the WIFI).</p>									</div>
