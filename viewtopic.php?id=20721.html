					<p>I&#039;ve enabled client mode on WRT54G V3 running 8.09.1 connecting to a WL-520GU and I was impressed at how simple it was to get it working just by placing the appropriate settings in in the LuCI interface in Essentials -&gt; Network -&gt; Wifi.</p><p>I&#039;d like to make the client router a bit more visible, though. If I leave the client set up in Essentials -&gt; Network -&gt; Local Network with the default address of 192.168.1.1 it just kind of disappears. I can actually get at the client by configuring the client address to be 192.168.2.2 in Essentials -&gt; Network -&gt; Local Network and adding an eth0 alias in the 192.168.2.0 subnet (ifconfig eth0:1 192.168.2.5 netmask 255.255.255.0). Then I can at least get at the client router via the web interface and SSH.</p><p>However, I&#039;m thinking client mode is most likely implemented at the link layer since the client seems to knows absolutely nothing about the router it&#039;s connecting to. I just can&#039;t figure out how to get the client to access the WL-520GU IP address. Ultimately I&#039;d like the client to have access to the Internet for maintenance purposes. Does anyone know if this is possible?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Pete</p>									</div>

					<p>Doh. All I did to get this to work was to configure the client&#039;s IP address (I used Essentials -&gt; Network -&gt; Local Network) to be in the same subnet as the router (I chose 192.168.1.2) and to configure the gateway and DNS server to be the IP of the router (192.168.1.1). I was pretty sure I&#039;d tried that and failed, which is why I was farting around with the client IP in a different subnet, but it works now. Dunno. Hopefully this will help someone else fiddling with the same thing.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Pete</p>									</div>

					<p>Ensuring that the IP address for the LAN in the bridged client is set to something different than the IP address for the LAN in the access point router but still within the same subnet might be a worthwhile addition to the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/bridgedclient">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/bridgedclient</a> directions, especially since default settings in a lot of firmware installations set the default LAN IP to 192.168.1.1.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>valuequest</strong> on 10 Feb 2011, 06:21)</p>
