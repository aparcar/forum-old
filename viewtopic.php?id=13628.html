					<p>I want to use CallVantage with my Nokia phone. Unfortunatelly AT&amp;T does not provide any means to use anything other than bundled TA. My goal is to reverse engineer AT&amp;T firmware and write symbian program to emulate AT&amp;T TA. I looked at traffic between my DWL-1120M and it appear that AT&amp;T uses some private http-based protocol for device registration. Unfortunatelly this D-Link model doesn&#039;t seem to use linux and I have no idea how to unpack and RE it&#039;s firmware. So:</p><p>1. Can anybody with enough knowledge to send me firmware of their TA. Preferably linksys (i belive they are linux based) but others will do too, even other D-Link models.</p><p>2. Can anybody with enough knowledge sniff traffic between their TA and at&amp;t server and provide me with logs? I do not need your user id and other private information. I need all URLs you enounter with everything after ? sign removed.</p><p>3. Is it still possible to buy AT&amp;T TA in retail store? I think some shops used to sell them but I can&#039;t find any now.</p>									</div>
