					<p>Thanks, brosky!<br />I created an account in this forum specifically because I appreciated your post so much, and I wanted to thank you!<br />Saved me from buying a new device... my EOS1650 stopped responding on every IP address after I pressed and held the &quot;reset&quot; button.&nbsp; Even the &quot;EnGenius Locater.exe&quot; program could not see it, though I could get to the RedBoot loader as it was restarting.</p><p>Using your instructions and the bios image you posted, I was able to recover my device, and then I installed the latest firmware, downloaded from EnGenius, and it works great again!</p>									</div>
