					<p>I&#039;m trying to make an indoor location system based on the RSSI if the devices, the question is:</p><p>I can access the RSSI of the devices connected to the router with: <strong>w dev wlan0 station dump</strong></p><p>But as we all know, indoor location needs way more data so I&#039;m adding 4 AP to the network.</p><p>Is there any way to get the RSSI of the devices connected to the network relative to every AP? So I know all the RSSI to every AP and make some math to locate the device position.</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s a interesting idea.</p><p>The solution could be:<br />-Configure 1 router as AP, all devices will connect to this router.<br />-The others routers will be in monitor mode, reading the RSSI of every single packet with airodump-ng, identify the device using the source mac address and store its RSSI in order to get the position.</p>									</div>
