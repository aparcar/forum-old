					<p>The 2.4 GHz vs 5 GHz thing is interesting. My router has both, both are the same strength when broadcasting.</p><p>I wish more of my devices were 5GHz capable because:<br />*I live in a flat so I don&#039;t have range problems<br />*Data transfer is much faster for 5GHz. I&#039;m lucky enough to have excellent download and upload speeds, so the wireless transfer speed is the bottleneck for me - I get better speed test results on 5GHz on the same device.<br />*Every other flat has a wireless network, as do some of the shops. There are TEN networks crowding the 2.4GHz space but 5GHz is completely clear.<br />*Being a flat, with so many kitchens and bathrooms around, the walls are full of water pipes. These are a pain for 2.4GHz but don&#039;t seem to troll 5GHz so much.</p><p>Clearly, I&#039;m not a network specialist or a developer, but for me choosing which frequency to use IS a big deal because it makes a big difference. A mod disagreeing with me wouldn&#039;t change the observable facts in my flat. Everyone should have a voice, the whole point of the forum is for people to help each other. When people read a thread, they don&#039;t chose a single post to believe and discount the rest, they use the whole conversion to inform themselves. They shouldn&#039;t have deleted your posts, or twisted the conversation to make themselves look better.</p><p>FREEEEEEEDOM! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Feathers</p>									</div>

					<p>@lizby: You are right, usualy i do not have to go so far in wording, but imagine fiew minutes someone spent his week-end defacing you, and manipulate the thread to turn you as the bad guy, just because you post some comment in Openwrt forum ...Maybe you will also change your wording for something stronger. Remember that i&#039;m supposed to be the one &quot;Full of shit&quot; &quot;that did not know a penny of what he said&quot; with a &quot;peanut brain&quot;...not the opposed. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>@Feathers McGraw:you are right, 5Ghz will be an advantage when there is a lot of 2,4Ghz SSID around you. Dual band was made to solve this kind of issue. There is good and bad in using both frequency. 5ghz as thicker Fresnel elypse so it is less bother by obstacle beside line of sight, 2,4ghz have better range when using same EIRP. on both band, then comes the legal side, In my country (for example) you have to play with that:<br />- 2,4 Ghz Max EIRP (inside/outside): 100 mW<br />- 5 Ghz Max EIRP (Inside) 250 mW<br />- 5 Ghz Mas EIRP (Outside) 1 W<br />As you could see if you want to make long range in France, you&#039;d better choose 5 Ghz. This is specific to my country i agree... I heard that EIRP is 1 W for both frequency in USA (to be confirmed), in this case you will take advantage of using 2,4 Ghz except if (like you) there is lot of noise in 2,4Ghz frequency because to much APs around or line of sight in the middle of trees field. In fact there is no real solution that solve everything it will depend on lot of parameters.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>yzy-oui-fi</strong> on 30 Oct 2013, 11:19)</p>

Sure if you compare two network with same tx and antenna gain, 2,4 ghz have better range than 5ghz.</p><p>the argue start with Murrkf comment that says i&#039;m &quot;Full of shit&quot; &quot;Don&#039;t know a penny what i&#039;m talking about&quot; and &quot;5ghz have better range than 2,4 ghz&quot; &quot;5ghz pentrate material like Laser&quot;. As all of this was Insane at me i ask for appologies and mentionned it was exactly the opposed. Then murrkf remove the &quot;Full of shit&quot; correct &quot;5ghz have better range than 2,4 ghz&quot; for &quot;2,4ghz have better range than 5 ghz&quot;...but leave the comment about my skill, then removed all my reply (it is good to be mods sometime! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> ).</p><p>then a another donkey joined the dance, and just told me after a week-end spent to fight against this defacing campain that their strike back is due to this openwrt thread and my comment. I&#039;m not sure what i posted here about DD-WRT was enough to declare War at me...</p><p>This give me the key to reply! Reply in this OpenWrt thread where the subject is move from DD-WRT to Openwrt and where DD-WRT mods defacing campain will not affect.</p><p>1°) Yes OpenWRT Forum Smell Roses and DD-WRT forum Smell shit more and more<br />2°) Unfortunatly DD-WRT did not improve its Facing with its Forum, i&#039;m not the first one who become a target of crazzy dogs of DD-WRT forum mods team, and probably not the last.<br />3°) DD-WRT Forum is a curious place where some &quot;Nolife&quot; guys turn their insignifiant poor existance into something facing more important.<br />4°) Murrkf, Lom and some others, are kind of administrative guys who dream of the kind of world described in Georges Orwell best seller &quot;1984&quot;. They found such a place with DD-WRT forum. </p><p>Lom said I claim to be a &quot;Wisp that built thousand of network&quot;...This is true but i don&#039;t claim! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />I will not share the exact number, but there is a lot of wireless networks over the world sold as white label that could be sign-up Yzy-oui-fi, Any way i&#039;m not here to make a sort of better ranking for me, so i will not share anymore about this point.</p><p>One thing is sure there is a Cancer in DD-WRT forum (I said forum, because i have nothing against their project or dev team). DD-WRT Forum is probably the best economical DD-WRT&#039;s weapon. but this weapon is less powerfull now, many users are fed up being flame by dummy who mods it, they leave the boat more and more. Do you know that French section of their forum is closed since december 2012, because Boobix the french mod, one of my friend leave the boat....Crazy isn&#039;t it? </p><p>Some one here spoke about Sveasoft old story...here is another interesting thing.</p><p>You probably heard about Firmware Mod Kit? Do you know that DD-WRT banned it&#039;s dev? and now they share FMK how to because none is able to use their buildroot....</p><p>All this smell shit! And I&#039;m so happy to have OpenWRT project to support my business...You couldn&#039;t imagine!</p></blockquote></div><br /><p>I read that post.&nbsp; Your characterization above about what was posted is not even close to being accurate.&nbsp; That &quot;full of shit&quot; comment was a little strong, but you were wrong.</p><p><a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=177921">www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=177921</a></p><p><a href="http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/tutorials/5-pros-and-cons-to-5-ghz-wi-fi-routers.html">http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/tutorials/5- … uters.html</a><br /><a href="http://compnetworking.about.com/od/wirelessfaqs/f/5ghz-gear.htm">http://compnetworking.about.com/od/wire … z-gear.htm</a><br /><a href="http://www.tp-link.com/CA/article/?faqid=499">http://www.tp-link.com/CA/article/?faqid=499</a></p><br /><p>The question was about range of 5ghz vs. 2.4.&nbsp; You indicated that it is not right that 2.4ghz has more range, and you were called on for giving bad advice.&nbsp; It was bad advice.&nbsp; &nbsp;Your post was wrong.&nbsp; And to suggest that everyone&nbsp; altered your posts in an effort to get you is paranoid.&nbsp; I read those posts pretty close to when they came in.&nbsp; They were not altered.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Donny</strong> on 30 Oct 2013, 18:43)</p>

					<p>Donny, &quot;Yof is full of shit&quot; as first reply is insane terms at me and it comes from a DD-WRT mods.&nbsp; </p><p>let me show you i wasn&#039;t wrong...with a sample!</p><p>Let say you have to cover 1km with wireless link. You have one 5ghz device and one 2,4ghz. the parameter that will show you the difference is called &quot;Free space loss&quot;. so let&#039;s calculate free&nbsp; space&nbsp; loss for both. To calculate it you could find the formula on wikipedia or use a web tool such as <a href="http://www.swisswireless.org/wlan_calc_en.html.">http://www.swisswireless.org/wlan_calc_en.html.</a></p><p>FSL 2,4GHz for 1 km gives -100.4 dB<br />FSL 5GHz for 1 km gives -107.2 dB</p><p>Avairage for 1 km gives&nbsp; 6.8 dB ( 4,7 mW)</p><p>this show that the difference between the 2 bands for 1 km is peanut! So i&#039;m right, Murrkf is wrong.</p><p>second point:<br />Lom share a graphic supposed to proove i&#039;m wrong that show wave lengh comparaison. If you look farther at this picture, it is writen that the first graph shows 2,4 Ghz band and the second shows 5Ghz... Ghz unit is place to give a cyclus coeficient to wave lengh, So 2,4 is smaller than 5. The exactly opposed of what he try to show (Hey Lom, your graphic is wrong! ). </p><p>All this just show that they were angry reading my comment in this Openwrt thread and they tried a strike back on me in their forum... without real weapon (Skill will be the real weapon).</p><p>If you still think i&#039;m wrong, i don&#039;t know what to say...:(</p><br /><br /><p>Anyway i will follow the <strong>wise comment post by Jow and stop discussing this point here</strong> as the subject is migrated from &quot;DD-WRT to OpenWRT&quot; and not&nbsp; &quot;DD-WRT forum mods skillness and incompetences&quot;. </p><p>Regards</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>yzy-oui-fi</strong> on 30 Oct 2013, 15:55)</p>
