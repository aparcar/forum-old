					<p>Hey there,</p><p>I have a flashed Siemens router that I have successfully been using in Germany. Now I moved to the United Kingdom, and their ADSL connection looks quite a bit different from the German one (I think it is RJ11 instead of the RJ45). Does anybody know whether I&#039;ll be able to use this German router in the UK? Is there some kind of adaptor or can it not be connected without a UK ADSL modem?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Frank</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey,</p><p>the Siemens machine you got is just an IP router (and eth/ath switch). There&#039;s no DSL modem built in. The RJ11 coming from the splitter carries the ADSL over POTS/ISDN signal, and you need an ADSL modem (w/ RJ11 in and RJ45 out) to &quot;convert&quot; it to eth frames. </p><p>I can send you a similar device (SE515, currently not Open/DD-WRT flashable) w/ ADSL modem built in (if there&#039;s space in hand luggage left).</p>									</div>
