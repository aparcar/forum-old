					<p>Bump.<br />My first post here <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> <br />I have been using wrt54gs for a while with kamikaze then white russian and lately backfire.<br />Since this is mostly experimenting from my side I would always setup something wrong and then have to go to failsafe to fix it.<br />Two days ago I setup something wrong in backfire (bridged my LAN to WAN I think) and I can login anymore <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Router boots and then picks IP from local DHCP server. I can ping it but cant login since firewall on WAN is blocking everything.<br />I tried to reset in all different ways but nothing seems to work.<br />I did not try this option yet but here is a question.<br />There is no failsafe anymore on backfire with wrt54gs (v1.1) ???<br />thx</p>									</div>

					<p>@kr16:<br />I think I already recovered my device even with backfire ;-) so there should be a recovery possibility.<br />The important thing is to set the boot_wait parameter so that you have time to use the TFTP recover mode.<br />You can check this if you set your PC to 192.168.1.2 and ping 192.168.1.1 -&gt; reboot your wrt54gs and check if you get a reply (a few pings should come back)</p>									</div>

					<p>I have tried the recipe on my bricked MR3420, but unfortunately it won&#039;t work. I get 3 to 4 pings back from 192.168.1.1 but then ist seems continuing booting into nirvana...

					<p>@kr16: your status seems quite fine, have you tried the dd-wrt mini builds (&quot;Mini-Build required for initial flashing via TFTP&quot;), normal images won&#039;t work!<br />Also check your firewall settings to allow the TFTP ports.<br />If you are on Windows download fping to maximize your chance to upload the image (fping can ping more often than the normal windows ping command)</p>									</div>
