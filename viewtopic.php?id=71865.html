					<p>Hello Guys,</p><p>My router is TP-Link TL-WR1043N/ND v1</p><p>I&#039;m using OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 / LuCI 15.05-149-g0d8bbd2 Release.</p><p>Initially, the problem that I had is when I turn of the router and turn on back again the WiFi doesn&#039;t show up every time. I need to turn off and turn on back again to make it work. </p><p>So yesterday I did a rest hoping that it will solve that problem, but after it the WiFi is not showing at all even with many reboots. </p><p>I tried to go back to the original firmware but same thing. <br />I installed again the OpenWrt and I checked log files after a lot of research and I found this using dmesg command:</p><p>[&nbsp; &nbsp;27.220000] ath: phy0: Bad EEPROM checksum 0xbfff or revision 0x000e<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;27.230000] ath: phy0: Unable to initialize hardware; initialization status: -22<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;27.230000] ath9k ath9k: failed to initialize device<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;27.240000] ath9k: probe of ath9k failed with error -22<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;35.820000] ar71xx: pll_reg 0xb8050014: 0x1a000000</p><p>Please help me because this is weird and I didn&#039;t do anything at all.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m no expert, but &quot;Bad EEPROM&quot; sounds like a hardware problem. <br />Possibly on the ART partition which holds setup and calibration data for the wireless.</p>									</div>
