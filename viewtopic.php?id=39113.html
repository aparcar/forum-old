					<p>Hi Guys,</p><p>in the past i had running 2 Buffalo WHR-HP-G54 Routers with DD-WRT Firmware. One of them was Router, the other one &quot;wired&quot; Access Point. This was working really good, with my &quot;old&quot; 18 Mbit internet connection.</p><p>Now i have a 100 Mbit cable connection, so I&#039;ve decided to buy new devices - thats why i choose 3 of the TP-Link 1043ND v1.8. the new cable connection is now im my cellar (before my pppoe was @top floor), but i have a cat 5e connection to my central gigabit switch on the top floor.</p><p>2 of them are running currently, but i had a lot of problems with the DD-WRT Firmware. My first try was the newest DD-WRT Firmware for this device, which was really bad - the device hangs up after 1-2 hours, every time. Now im on r18024 from 2011 and its working since 20 hours, but the wlan performance is very bad. I have a Samsung RF711 Notebook with Wireless-N Adapter and i reach only 25-30 Mbits DIRECTLY at the Access Point with 90% signal strength.</p><p>My target scenario now: 1 TP-Link as Router in my cellar, 1 TP-Link as Access Point (wired) in my main floor &amp; 1 TP-Link as Access Point (wired) in my top floor.</p><p>Now my Questions: Is OpenWRT for me better? are the drivers &amp; compatibility better improved? is the wlan speed better ?</p><p>Other Question: Are they any releases (from a new trunc) with an already activated wlan &amp; webgui ? which is the prefered web gui ? Its bad that i need internet to get as an example luci because then i have to chill at my cellar <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>Will 10.03.1 work on my v1.8 ? <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-tl-wr1043nd-v1-squashfs-factory.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … actory.bin</a></p><p>Should i use a newer trunc version, or is this stable and okay for me? is a mac-change on the WAN-Port possible as on DD-WRT ?</p><p>And .. before i forgot that ... sorry for my bad english, it isn&#039;t really good - but i hope, you can understand me <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>best regards<br />izzy</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>iZzy</strong> on 5 Sep 2012, 01:11)</p>

					<p>I would give the <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09-beta/ar71xx/generic/">12.09 beta</a> a try before 10.03.1 as your device may ship with a newer bootloader (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd">which may not compatible with 10.03.x</a>). It&#039;s code base is also quite old.<br />I&#039;ve been running 10.03.1 since it was released and it&#039;s been very stable, but I just recently upgraded to a recent trunk build and it&#039;s been solid as well, so might as well stick to the newer code base.</p><p>Personally, I prefer editing the various configs via the CLI (vi or UCI), but if you require a GUI, I believe LuCI is still the preferred one to install.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>KillaB</strong> on 5 Sep 2012, 21:41)</p>

					<p>I&#039;ve been running 10.03.1 on WR1043 v1.8 since long now.<br />I&#039;ve been also using DD-WRT.<br />I don&#039;t see any reason in choosing DD-WRT!<br />OpenWRT seems to have better support and faster development. And it&#039;s more stable as well.<br />My personal opinion is that you can stick with 10.03.1 until 12.09 will reach its final release.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>uqbar</strong> on 5 Sep 2012, 21:51)</p>

					<p>Hi Guys, thank you very much for your answers - very helpful <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>really nice community here, because on dd-wrt board i never get an answer to a question - only everytime rtfm &amp; co. -.-</p><p>i had flashed now 10.03.1 stable release from dec. 2011 ... was ok, but old ^^</p><p>Now i&#039;ve flashed the newest build from here: <a href="http://aspiregemstone.blogspot.cz/2011/10/openwrt-built-for-tp-link-wr1043nd.html">http://aspiregemstone.blogspot.cz/2011/ … 043nd.html</a></p><p>It have luci included and is newer, too. Is it possible that this is already 12.09 beta ? On my Luci Webinterface i found this about this build:</p><p>Router Name: OpenWrt<br />Router Model: TP-Link TL-WR1043N/ND v1<br />Firmware Version: OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment r33288 / LuCI Trunk (trunk+svn9190)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Kernel Version: 3.3.8</p><br /><p>I&#039;ve configured this device now (for testing first) as an Access Point. I used WinSCP and edited network, dhcp &amp; wireless in /etc/config ^^ and it was working <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>My Notebook has an N-Adapter, but it seems that this Adapter can only reach 65 Mbit. It&#039;s a Samsung RF711, can this be possible? File-Transfer near this Access-Point is 5-6 MB/s, this should be this 65 Mbit. Right ?</p><p>Soo... im planning to change all my devices to OpenWRT. Currently 2 of them running with DD-WRT and at the third im playing around with the &quot;all-new&quot; (for me ^^) OpenWRT <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>But i have one bash script for my DD-WRTs which changes the WAN Mac Adress of the Router and i think i can&#039;t get this working for OpenWRT <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> Problem is, that i need this for a new ip from my isp. Im using it 1-2 times in the month! I&#039;ve googled already for an bash script or an example but haven&#039;t found something.</p><p>Normaly i need for my home network:<br />- DDNS Change<br />- Router &amp; AP-Only Mode (is working <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" />)<br />- Good WLAN-Stability &amp; Speeds<br />- should be rock solid - and openwrt seems to be more stable then DD-WRT<br />- WAN-Port MAC Change with BASH-Script (thats my biggest problem)<br />- port forwarding<br />- masquerading (dyndns should be available through my local network)<br />- &quot;stock&quot; firewall (i don&#039;t change anything there, but it should have the stock security like disabling ports which are not explicit redirected etc.)</p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>iZzy</strong> on 5 Sep 2012, 23:22)</p>

					<p>Thanks Guys!</p><p>Im now on the newest 12.09 beta build for my 1043ND <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>Seems to be very &quot;stable&quot; ... okay, maybe it&#039;s not 100% stable but for me as an DD-WRT damaged guy its absolutly rock solid in comparison <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>I have to say that i was very happy with DD-WRT on my Buffalo WHR-HP-G54DD. Old devices, but they&#039;re very stable - no reboots, no hang up&#039;s etc. - even with newer DD-WRT builds. But with my 3 new 1043ND its absolutly a cramp. After build 18024 (which was 2011 AND beta) every newer version is working worse - especially the newest build, which hangs up after 1-2 hours on all my 3 devices ^^</p><p>@uqbar</p><p>You&#039;re right, DD-WRT&#039;s DDNS isn&#039;t really solid - have often problems, that it detects the new ip and then hangs up without update. And my WLAN-Speeds seems now to be better. More Range and more Speed, thats now okay for me - and all is absolutly stable for now!</p><p>And i think i&#039;ve found a solution for my bash mac-change issue <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> I can logon per ssh via remote and perform the uci commands, tried it already on my 1043nd with 12.09 and it seems that this is working <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>So no more problems to enjoy now OpenWRT on all 3 devices <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>No, there is no ignore flag to tear down the firewall, the best way is to simply disable it using /etc/init.d/firewall disable (or through the startup manager as you already did).</p>									</div>
