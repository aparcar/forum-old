					<p>@cyrus:<br />My machine does have an address in the ULA range, but only via SLAAC. It doesn&#039;t have one via DHCPv6. I&#039;m not entirely sure how the DHCPv6 client works on OS X 10.8. A quick packet capture shows:</p><p>1. both subnets are advertised in the DHCPv6 advertise message</p><p>2. OS X sends a DHCPv6 request for only the globally routable prefix</p><p>3. 6relayd sends DHCPv6 reply, but it includes both prefixes. Only one was requested, so its unclear why its sending both back?</p><p>So, there&#039;s a few questions:<br />1. What does the RFC say about requesting IP addresses in a DHCPv6 request when two or more prefixes are advertised. I&#039;m not sure, I&#039;d need to go look.</p><p>2. Why is 6relayd replying with both prefixes when only one is requested?</p><p>3. Maybe it would be prudent to only have 6reladyd report in LuCI those addresses that were actually requested, rather than the ones offered?</p><p>Thoughts?</p>									</div>

					<p>@adam2104: Basically anything the clients sends in DHCPv6 is only a hint to the server and can be silently ignored.<br />A client can also send a completely empty request and expect to get addresses so using the requested address as a base for anything is not a good idea. The client should accept that the server offers more than one address to it like it does for SLAAC.</p><p>Whether DHCPv6 is requested or not is not triggered by the availability of any addresses via SLAAC but using a flag in the router advertisement so it&#039;s not really related.</p><p>I&#039;m not entirely sure how to deal with this yet. It just confirms once again that doing stateful-only is not a good idea. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />I will probably sort the announced addresses so that global addresses are always in front of ULAs and also that addresses with a bigger preferred lifetime are in front of those with a lower one.</p><p>About the hosts-file its maybe best to only add the first address to it. But the lease-view in general could stay as it is I guess. I mean the address is assigned to the client in the end, the client is just ignorant <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

					<p>I just pushed some new updates. There is a new list-option ip6class which lets you define which prefixes will be assigned to an interface. The default class of a prefix is the name of its originating interface (e.g. wan6). Thus if I want my lan interface to only get a prefix from wan6 but e.g. not the ULA (which has the class: local) I can set &quot;list ip6class wan6&quot; in my lan interface-section. This make sense if you have multiple uplinks.</p><br /><p>@phuque99: See above. This is probably helpful to you.<br />@adam2104: I changed the behaviour now to what I said in my last post. Only the first address - hostname pair is added to the hosts-file. Also the DHCPv6-server now sorts addresses so that global addresses are now always on the first position.</p>									</div>

					<p>@CyrusFF</p><br /><p>Edit: previous issue was resolved when router was rebooted with proper settings on each configuration file. I confirm that &#039;list ip6class wan6&#039; on &quot;lan&quot; will tell 6relayd advertise only the wan6 prefix. I believe you do this by making sure that the &quot;lan&quot; interface acquires only the wan6 prefix.</p><p>However this presents another problem for my own setup. I&#039;m trying to use both HE&#039;s v6 and ISP&#039;s dynamic v6 on the lan wired interface. But I only want to advertise the ISP&#039;s v6 on lan for PC/Mac clients, while &quot;servers&quot; continue to use HE&#039;s v6 addresses.

					<p>You&#039;d have to setup a VLAN and connect the servers to that, then set it to only apply the HE addresses to that &quot;interface&quot; and ISP addresses to the normal LAN one (Why would you want to do that btw? does your ISP blocks ports or something?)</p><p>I&#039;ve also got a question actually, what&#039;s the reasoning behind setting ip6assign to 60 by default for PD?

It works fine with Windows 7 but with Windows 8 the information never seems to be applied.

					<p>@The_Decrpytor: thanks. It seems both Windows and 6relayd behave strangely here. what the hell?!<br />Windows - although receiving no M-flag in the RA - tries to do stateful DHCPv6.<br />6relayd - although having prefixes configured (and sending them in the RA) claims it doesn&#039;t have any addresses available.</p><p>I&#039;m confused to say the least <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />Edit:<br />Aah&nbsp; I have a clue.

					<p>Tha option is called route information and it is required that we sent it along. Although its value seems to be wrong. it should be ff instead of 74 in the data. Anyway that shouldn&#039;t be a problem for your case. I&#039;m still not entirely sure what is wrong though. Oh well let&#039;s see next week.</p>									</div>

					<p>@CyrusFF</p><p>I upgraded my router to pickup the new version of 6relayd, so now hosts are getting assigned addresses alongside SLAAC addresses, but Windows 8 still isn&#039;t using the DNS information (When I first brought up the adapter after upgrading my router it did actually use the v6 DNS info, but it was pretty quickly removed for whatever reason) I recorded a new trace and I&#039;ll send you the link.</p><p>No host information is getting written out either for dnsmasq to use either, but considering the state of DHCPv6 in clients I&#039;m not that surprised. Windows 8 seems to be asking for an address, but then never assigns it to the interface, while OS X does, etc.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks. I figured out whats wrong now. Apparently my workaround for iOS (announcing the ULA-prefix as deprecated) broke Windows. This should be fixed now.</p>									</div>

					<p>Excellent, I disabled the ULA deprecation on my current install and straight away both my Windows 7 and Windows 8 machines started using the DHCPv6 allocated address, the provided DNS information and had their hostname added to the hosts file on the router. Seems Windows 7 is a bit more flexible in that regard (Using DNS), while 8 just rejected it.</p>									</div>

					<p>@The_Decryptor: If you&#039;re able to, can you test 6relayd with only RA? I noticed that my Win7, like my Mac, isn&#039;t able to route v6 traffic even after obtaining valid v6 prefix and router&#039;s local-link address as default route. I didn&#039;t face this is issue with radvd. I suspect it could be my dual-v6 link setup.</p><p>This is the 6relayd RA-only configuration:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config server default
    #option master    wan6
    option network    lan
    option rd    server
    #option dhcpv6    server
    #option fallback_relay    &#039;rd dhcpv6 ndp&#039;
    #option management_level 2
    option compat_ula 0</code></pre></div>									</div>

					<p>@Manani</p><p>In the WebUI it&#039;s under Network &gt; IPv6 RA and DHCPv6 and the option is called &quot;ULA-preference compatibility&quot;</p><p>@phuque99</p><p>I can try, but since I&#039;ve only got one v6 uplink I doubt I&#039;d hit the same problem as you&#039;re getting, and it&#039;s still announcing both my ISP provided v6 prefix and the ULA prefix anyway. I also don&#039;t think DHCPv6 actually provides routing information, that&#039;s all handled by RA, so disabling it shouldn&#039;t change anything.</p>									</div>
