					<p>Hello Horde,</p><p>So I&#039;d like to build a captive portal for use no-charge by artists/audiences of a performance gallery, but I&#039;ve got questions:</p><p>1) Can anyone with experience recommend coova-chilli over wifidog or vice versa?&nbsp; If so, what are the perceived strengths/weaknesses?</p><p>2) Does either package handle all dependencies for advertised features (radius auth, vpn, etc) or do those packages have to be manually selected for building?</p><p>3) Does the web interface for either package integrate into Luci or do they replace it?&nbsp; Similarly, does it make sense to build with Luci unselected to avoid interfering with the portal interface?</p><p>Thanks in advance for assuredly informed answers.</p>									</div>
