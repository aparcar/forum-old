					<p>I&#039;m trying to set some traffic control mechanism on my archer c7v2 router. It looks like that it works more or less in the way I want. I just attached qdiscs (+ egress queues) to WAN(eth0) and LAN(br-lan) interfaces. It looks like this:</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/fIQPBUN.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/fIQPBUN.png" /></span></p><p>In short. I have divided the main queue into 2 smaller (:10 and :20). In that way :10 has my ISP&#039;s connection parameters (15/1 mbit/s), and :20 has the rest of the 1gbit/s link.</p><p>I mark packets using iptables, and I don&#039;t really use the default filter. Marking of the packets works just fine. As you can see those packets go to the different queues (the default one is :600).</p><p>This setup seems to work for LAN&lt;-&gt;WAN, and for LAN&lt;-&gt;ROUTER traffic, but when it comes to LAN&lt;-&gt;LAN there&#039;s no movement at all. I mean, the connection works, the throughput is a way higher than my ISP&#039;s parameters, but I don&#039;t see any packets that have src 192.168.0.0/16 and dst 192.168.0.0/16. They would go to the :1000 queue.</p><p>I&#039;ve made some tests using iperf tool, and when I typed the following command on one of the LAN hosts:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#  iperf -c 192.168.1.1 -i 10 -t 1000</code></pre></div><p>I got this entry on the router:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># cat /proc/net/nf_conntrack | grep &quot;192.168.1.166&quot;
ipv4     2 tcp      6 7439 ESTABLISHED src=192.168.1.166 dst=192.168.1.1 sport=56878 dport=5001 packets=126621 bytes=189927188 src=192.168.1.1 dst=192.168.1.166 sport=5001 dport=56878 packets=51007 bytes=2652372 [ASSURED] mark=10 use=2</code></pre></div><p>As you can see it works, and the mark is set to 10 as it should be. </p><p>When I try to do the same using different LAN address (still from the same host):</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#  iperf -c 192.168.1.150 -i 10 -t 1000</code></pre></div><p>There&#039;s no entry in the router&#039;s conntrack table:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># cat /proc/net/nf_conntrack | grep &quot;192.168.1.166&quot;</code></pre></div><p>I don&#039;t really need to worry about the LAN&lt;-&gt;LAN traffic, but I just wanted to know whether it&#039;s a bug or just some performance issue fix, or maybe I made a mistake somewhere in my setup.</p>									</div>

					<p>I could be out for lunch, bur does the archer c7 not have a switch for the LAN ports? So unless you use VLAN-trickery the LAN-LAN packets never hit the router proper, but are just handled directly by the switch. Out of curiosity, why are you using sfq instead of fq_codel?</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the info. I wasn&#039;t sure whether the switch traffic can make it to the conntrack. I wanted to be sure that I didn&#039;t make any mistakes in the config.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Out of curiosity, why are you using sfq instead of fq_codel?</p></blockquote></div><p>Because <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Advanced_traffic_control">here</a> you can read &quot;Martin Devera, author of HTB, recommends SFQ&quot; at the top of HTB classes.
