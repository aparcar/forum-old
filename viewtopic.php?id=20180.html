					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am trying to figure out the uci-based firewall in kamikaze and have a question about setting up a paranoid firewall.</p><p>1) I want to block outgoing packets (except selected ones) from the lan to internet.<br />2) I want to block different outgoing packets (except selected ones) from the router to the internet<br />or<br />3) block outgoing packets from lan to internet, but not block from router to internet.<br />or<br />4) block out from router unless they are are outgoing from the lan</p><p>Is doing 1+2 possible?&nbsp; What about 3?&nbsp; 4? How do I set them up?</p><p>I see that for incoming one can specify a zone or &#039;Device&#039; as a destination, but there isn&#039;t the equivalent outgoing that I can see.</p><p>I want to set up my router as a web server (with attached USB drive), but I would want to block everything except sessions that were opened by a port 80 (or maybe port 8080) request (for requests/outgoing originating on the firewall; for things forwarded I&#039;d want different rules).</p><p>I know how to do this in shorewall, but not in the uci firewall.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cshore</strong> on 4 May 2009, 17:19)</p>
