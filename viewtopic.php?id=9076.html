					<p>Folks,<br />I incorrectly flashed a 2.6 kernel version to my Wrt54gl (picked the wrong file to upgrade to by accident after build the images). I&#039;m trying to get back to either the 2.4 version so I can use the broadcom interface or a wr version. after perusing the forum and FAQ, I have tried to use the failsafe mechanism to no avail. I am able to get the unit into failsafe mode (determined by using ethereal to trace the packets) however each time I issue the TFTP command (from windows XP) I receive ICMP destination port unreachable packets in response from the router.&nbsp; Ultimately the TFTP transfer fails. I can still actually boot into the 2.6 kamikazee version of the firmware and telnet into the unit but could not find a way to execute a reflash/upgrade/downgrade from that point (being new to this, I might be a little dense). The IP address of the router is 192.168.1.1 and the IP address of the laptop (statically assigned) is 192.168.1.10. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated</p><p>AreYouWireless<br />= = = = = = =</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry folks - I guess I was being a little dense - after perusing the forum a little more I was able to figure this out myself - documenting this just incase someone else needs some guidance</p><p>Since my router is a wrt54gl, the &quot;image_file&quot; I wanted to use to downgrade from kamikazee was openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx from the white-russian release. To get the image_file onto the router use the following steps:</p><p>1) set up a FTP server (if you don&#039;t have one already) accessible to the router</p><p>2) copy(put) the file image_file into a directory accessible by ftp (FTProot?)</p><p>3) telnet/ssh into the router</p><p>4) cd /tmp</p><p>5) wget ftp://user:password@hostname/path/image_file <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;use vaild credentials for the FTP server (username:password). I believe the default username<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if not specified is BusyBox (at least for Kamikazee). This comand will transfer image_file into /tmp</p><p>6) mtd -r write&nbsp; &nbsp;image_file linux <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This command will write&nbsp; image_file out to flash. After MTD finishes writing the image_file,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the wrt54gl router should reboot and the new image should be running.</p><p>Thanks again to ThePeople who posted this information under the thread<br />HELP!!
