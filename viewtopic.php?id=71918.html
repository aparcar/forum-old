					<p>I&#039;m impressed by myself... I hooked up the TP-Link and checked that it worked, downloaded tfp2.exe and the correct bin-file, fired up the tfp2 with 192.168.0.66, started the router and got a few error messages from the tfp2 about password. Now, when I turn on/plug in the router, I see the number 4 LED from the left (I think it&#039;s WAN) light up red for a few seconds and then nothing. Nothing at all. No LEDs, and of course no contact. I have tried to use tfp2 again a couple of times, but nothing happens. So is this a &quot;hard brick&quot;, meaning &quot;fun while it lasted, goodbye&quot;, or is it possible to recover from this. I only have Windows, and I must say that I have a problem understanding the instructions for unbricking. And I wanted this thing to use it on my DSL modem to utilize DNSMasq, so I hope I can fix it and use that function.</p>									</div>

					<p>Is it a v1 or a v2?</p><p>Wiki for the V1 says that TFTP flashing will overwrite the bootloader, so the bin file you supply must include a bootloader.&nbsp; These are generally created by hacking up a factory firmware file which includes &#039;boot&#039; in its name.&nbsp; OpenWrt doesn&#039;t include bootloaders.</p><p>If you wiped out the bootloader, attempting to TFTP by holding down the WPS button while booting will not work, the WPS light will not come on.&nbsp; In that case it is pretty severely bricked and the only way to recover is by writing the flash chip directly with a SPI programmer.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 30 Aug 2017, 04:10)</p>

					<p>Yeah, it&#039;s a V1. How weird. Are there more than one wiki pages? I read this one: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/archer-c50">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/archer-c50</a></p><p>And there&#039;s no mention of that, at least not as far as I can find. There&#039;s only the instructions to obtain firmware (Firmware OpenWrt Install URL) and install it, no mentioning of hacking the firmware before in the debricking section, where it says &quot;To prepare recovery file cut the first 0x200 (that is 512) Bytes from original firmware (This cut only header of firmware, Recovery need bootloader and firmware)&quot; So I guess I&#039;m the victim of either being half blind or of an incomplete page.</p>									</div>
