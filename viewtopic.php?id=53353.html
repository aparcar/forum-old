					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to install OpenWRT on a TPLink TL-WR841ND, however I keep getting this error:</p><p>Error code: 18001<br />Upgrade unsuccessfully because the length of the upgraded file is incorrect. Please check the file name</p><p>I already tried a variety of different filenames, I also tried installing the downloadable firmware for the device found here <a href="http://www.tp-link.com/en/support/download/?model=TL-WR841ND&amp;version=V9#tbl_j">http://www.tp-link.com/en/support/downl … n=V9#tbl_j</a> which went fine. Renaming the openWRT file to the filename of the official file however resulted in the same error.</p><p>Hardware Version: WR841N v9 00000000<br />Firmware Version: 3.14.4 Build 131129 Rel.39318n</p><p>Is there anything I&#039;m doing wrong? Is the device even supported? It did appear to be supported looking at this page <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr842nd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr842nd</a> Looking at the v2.0 on the page and the v9 in my router interface now, it may be unsupported after all I guess.</p><p>Thanks in advance to anyone who can shed some light on this issue,<br />Tom</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry, somehow I didn&#039;t think of that. Thanks drawz, this image worked indeed <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>However, I&#039;m encountering a very weird problem right now. I won&#039;t get any internet connection except for the first few seconds when the WAN interface eth1 is brought up. So, after system boot and after reconnecting the interface, I&#039;m able to wget stuff in an ssh session, but after a couple of seconds it just stops working and fails with &quot;No route to host&quot;.&nbsp; No other errors are shown immediately, neither in the log nor anywhere else. Only after a couple of minutes I get this output: <a href="http://imgur.com/D1k0MXZ">http://imgur.com/D1k0MXZ</a> (I hope it&#039;s readable), &quot;Sending renew&quot; is the first output I get after it failed. At that point, the IP address that was assigned to the WAN interface disappears as well. I should probably add, I&#039;m inside a university network, which has a MAC filter. The MAC is definitely correct though, connecting the ethernet cable to my laptop works flawlessly and it used to work with the stock firmware. Does anyone have an idea what I could try to debug the issue?</p>									</div>
