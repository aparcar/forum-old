					<p>I am new to OpenWrt.&nbsp; First let me say thank you to all that have worked to put this together.&nbsp; I retired a couple of years ago.&nbsp; Up until very recently, I have been able to remain blissfully ignorant of IPv6.&nbsp; I was schooled in IPv4.&nbsp; I now have Hughes Gen4 (satellite, it was that or dialup) as an ISP.&nbsp; They have native IPv6 with a /61 network assignment.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the prefix will change.&nbsp; I know it changes when I reboot the Hughes modem.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure but I think it also changes when comm is lost due to weather.&nbsp; There may be other times the prefix changes as well; I haven&#039;t figured it out yet.</p><p>I am using the Community Optimized build for WNDR3700/3800, by&nbsp; arokh (Firmware Version&nbsp; &nbsp; OpenWrt Barrier Breaker r41283 / LuCI Trunk (svn-r10375)&nbsp; Kernel Version&nbsp; &nbsp; 3.10.36).&nbsp; I chose this because I have a WNDR3700v2 router and, as I understand it, Barrier Breaker is supposed to have support for IPv6.</p><p>The only documentation I&#039;ve been able to find for odhcp is on this website: <a href="https://github.com/sbyx/odhcpd">https://github.com/sbyx/odhcpd</a></p><p>I see an option in the /etc/config/dhcp file called &quot;option maindhcp &#039;0&#039; &quot; which is not in the documentation.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve assumed that if set to 1 would indicate that odhcp is the main or only dhcp server on the network.&nbsp; I have set this option to 1.</p><p>In the /etc/dnsmasq.conf I have set --no-dhcp-interface=eth0 to disable the dhcp server but continue to serve dns.</p><p>I&#039;ve gotten odhcp to hand out IPv4 and statefull IPv6 addresses.&nbsp; What I am unable to do is to get dnsmasq to recognize the leases and/or hostnames.</p><p>Can someone tell me how to accomplish this?</p><p>I&#039;d like to be able to run my own mail and webservers.&nbsp; Dnsmasq is supposed to be able to be configured as Authoritative for a domain.&nbsp; If I can get DNSmasq to track the changing prefix and update the host names / AAAA records, I&#039;m thinking I&#039;d be good to go (if I&#039;ve missed something, feel free to educate me).</p><p>In case you are wondering, IPv4 is not an option, Hughes won&#039;t issue a static address and their subscribers are all behind a NAT which there is no access to.</p><p>Thanks for the help.</p>									</div>

					<p>odhcpd writes hostfiles to /tmp/hosts/ and sends SIGHUP to dnsmasq on updates so dnsmasq should be up to date.<br />So when trying to find out what is wrong you should check /tmp/hosts/odhcpd.</p>									</div>

					<p>CyrusFF, thanks for your reply.&nbsp; The odhcpd file was being written to /tmp/odhcpd instead of /tmp/hosts/odhcpd.&nbsp; This was the default config from installation.&nbsp; The file was being written to, but the luci interface would not display any v6 lease.</p><p>Before I recognized this, I changed to hnyman&#039;s latest build for the WNDR3700.</p><p>What I notice now is that the v6 lease has a lease time of 9 minutes whereas the v4 lease time is as specified in the /etc/config/dhcp file.</p><p>I&#039;ve also noticed in the luci display, once a lease has expired, v4 or v6, it stays being displayed as being expired even though the lease has been renewed.&nbsp; This is with autorefresh on in the luci display.&nbsp; Its not a big deal, but its handy to have the accurate lease time displayed.</p>									</div>
