					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a TP-Link to which I uploaded Openwrt (why not should I be here? :-)).</p><p>I&#039;m looking for setting up my TP-Link as network extender (so I have wifi in my entire house, including those areas where my ISP wifi does not reach). My ISP router has 192.168.1.1 as IP. Also y TP-Link has the same Ip (I didn&#039;t touch it after loading Luc√≠ on it). </p><p>I&#039;m pretty much following the instructions given in this video youtube.com/watch?v=1vsPz_aLZeE and when it gets to the minute 1:06 (right after clicking on Save and Apply) my screen gets there forever. If I refresh my browser it won&#039;t load anything and the default wifi (openwrt) will be gone. Also, if I look at the TP-Link I&#039;ll see the Wifi led flashing intermently. </p><p>Any idea of what I might be doing wrong?</p><p>At the end of the day, I&#039;m trying to extend my network to other areas of my house, but still be able to connect to the other network devices (NAS) I have connected to my ISP router, etc...</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
