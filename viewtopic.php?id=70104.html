					<p>I&#039;m trying to set up an Ethernet bridge between two wireless devices. Normally, one of the devices is an AP and the other is the client. Both have fixed IP addresses. When put in proximity to each other, the client automatically connects to the AP. For my project, I want to create a transparent Ethernet bridge between them. The two wireless devices should be able to connect to each other without realizing there&#039;s an Ethernet bridge between them. It should look something like this:</p><p>(Wireless AP) ~~~~~~~ (OpenWRT Device A) ------------- (OpenWrt Device B) ~~~~~~~ (Wireless Client)</p><p>Tildes (~~) represent wireless connections and dashes (--) represent Ethernet. Assume the Ethernet cable is long enough to prevent the two wireless devices from being able to &quot;see&quot; each other. </p><p>The wireless devices are not running OpenWRT, so we can treat them as blackboxes that can&#039;t be changed (they&#039;re actually Yocto builds). They both have static IPs. The AP is 10.1.1.1 and the client is 10.1.1.10.</p><p>I&#039;ve read extensively through the OpenWRT.org wiki pages and there is lots of information about bridging devices together, but I keep finding myself getting confused with different configuration settings in /etc/config/wireless and /etc/config/network in their examples.</p><p>Can I even do what I&#039;m trying to do? How do I make Device A appear as a client to the AP, but also forward everything downstream to the client. And similarly, how do I make Device B look like an AP to the client, but also forward everything upstream to the AP?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rusttree</strong> on 4 Mar 2017, 04:33)</p>

					<p>I think I&#039;ve identified the root of my confusion. In a more typical application of a wireless bridge, you have a topology like this:</p><p>(A) ---- (B) ~~~~ (C) ---- (D)</p><p>Anything A transmits will be seen by B, since they&#039;re directly connected via Eithernet (or a switch or whatever). So if A is trying to talk to D, B will see the packets and forward them on to C, and then C to D. But my ethernet bridge topology looks like this:</p><p>(A) ~~~~ (B) ---- (C) ~~~~ (D)</p><p>Since A and B are connected through a typical Wifi connection, B can only see packets specifically addressed to it. So I must make B&#039;s IP address match that of D. But once those packets from A arrive at B, the transmission is complete. The packet has arrived at the intended IP address. What tells B to keep going and forward those packets on to C and so on to D?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rusttree</strong> on 4 Mar 2017, 05:04)</p>

					<p>Thank you zo0ok. I came across that link earlier and it didn&#039;t seem like it applied, since it&#039;s specifically for wireless bridge and wired devices on either end. My setup is the inverse of that (ethernet bridge in the middle and wireless devices on the either end). Do the concepts still apply?</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenWrt Device B looks like a standard setup but without a WAN interface.
