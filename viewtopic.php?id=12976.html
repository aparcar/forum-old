					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m running 7.09 and successfully use pure-ftpd in puredb mode and it work well when i provide different user names i created.

My guess is that neither of them should be there.</p><p>I will appreciate if someone could take time to test this</p><p>Rgds. margate</p>									</div>

					<p>Remove the -E command-line option in /etc/default/pure-ftpd. Next you have to create a system user named &#039;ftp&#039; in /etc/passwd to get anonymous FTP working. It&#039;s also important that the user has no valid shell, use /bin/false.</p><p>E.g.:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ftp:x:500:500:Linux User,,,:/srv/ftp:/bin/false</code></pre></div><p>This should work then. I&#039;m currently working on migrating the Pure-FTPd configuration to UCI. See this <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=12978">thread</a> if you are interested. Works not bad so far. Only the stop() function or better the Busybox start-stop-daemon needs to be patched to work with multiple PIDs.</p>									</div>
