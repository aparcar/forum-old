					<p>I recently purchased the WE-826T, with Sim Card port.&nbsp; I inserted the my data card and expected a clear cut path to configuring it.&nbsp; No luck, the required input if any is very confusing to an amateur like myself.&nbsp; If someone would please give me simple step by step instructions on where to go and what needs to be input, would be greatly appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s a data sim card, that I signed up for pre paid each month.&nbsp; It fits in the Sim Card slot on the router and even locks in.&nbsp; The slot is on the side in the middle and is labeled SIM.<br />I can take the metal cover off and see whats inside.&nbsp; Is it possible that the later models came with a sim card slot.&nbsp; It was advertised as having one when I bought the last one that Amazon had.</p>									</div>

					<p>This is a PCIE 4G modem card.&nbsp; This one is not a good example because it only works with a US carrier, but all modem cards look about the same.<br /><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sierra-Airprime-MC7750-Express-Verizon/dp/B00JY4SHEY">https://www.amazon.com/Sierra-Airprime- â€¦ B00JY4SHEY</a><br />This is a picture of the inside of a WE826T as it is usually sold, with no modem card installed.&nbsp; <br /><a href="https://wikidevi.com/wiki/File:826_board_top.jpeg">https://wikidevi.com/wiki/File:826_board_top.jpeg</a><br />The card fits in the large black socket on the left side marked &quot;15315&quot;&nbsp; The screw holes in the right side of the card secure it to the holes in the router motherboard.&nbsp; The three antenna connectors on the card would lead to antennas that are tuned for the 4G band in use.&nbsp; Three or 4 of the pins in the big connector go to the SIM card slot on the bottom of the router board.&nbsp; The modem reads encrypted data from the SIM to authorize its login on the cellular network.&nbsp; If a modem card is not installed, the SIM card doesn&#039;t connect to anything.</p><p>There was also an option to fit the WE826 with a 5 GHz ac wifi card instead of a cellular modem.&nbsp; Of course it cannot be used on cellular with that card in the slot, though you can use an external USB modem.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 1 Nov 2017, 02:13)</p>

					<p>Thank you I have verified that the modem Card is installed in the router, and that the new 4G LTE sim card I got from Kolbi, is standard fits in the modem slot and works in USA devices. Now comes the hard part for me.&nbsp; What settings do I select on the Admin pages of the WE-826T router, and where would I get that information.&nbsp; There are a lot of different settings in the drop downs and I really don&#039;t know what is required to get the Sim Card and Router configured properly, Help.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK with the hardware in order you are going to need to install some device drivers to have it show up as a device.&nbsp; &nbsp;When the drivers are working, the modem should appear as an additional &quot;Ethernet&quot; port that you can connect to the WAN network.&nbsp; </p><p>Note that even though the modem is in a PCIe slot, its connection to the CPU is USB.&nbsp; So you will see a lot of references to USB.</p><p>This is the OpenWrt wiki page.&nbsp; You can also look at general Linux instructions for your modem, the drivers are the same.<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/ltedongle">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/ltedongle</a></p>									</div>

					<p>You can get it to work, but it&#039;s not easy.&nbsp; The Seirra cards require modem manager I believe.&nbsp; You&#039;ll have to compile a new image to get it to work to my knowledge.&nbsp; Sounds like this might be a little tough for you.&nbsp; If you get it working let me know.&nbsp; Which country out of curiosity?</p><p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/aleksander0m/modemmanager-openwrt">https://bitbucket.org/aleksander0m/modemmanager-openwrt</a></p>									</div>
