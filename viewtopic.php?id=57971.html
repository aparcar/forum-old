					<p>Did you cd to the tmp directory before issuing the fwupdate command?&nbsp; Or put /tmp/ before the file name so it knows where to find it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry my bad that was the problem but now fwupdate.real complains about the version of the firmware image, because it is built with prefix &quot;XM&quot; instead of the &quot;BZ&quot;</p><p> how do i edit the binary to replace characters 4-6 in the firmware image file or could you walk me through using the image builder and patching the makefile.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
