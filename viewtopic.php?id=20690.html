					<p>Sorry if this comes across as a bit trollish, but this issue has been bugging me for quite some time.&nbsp; Tonight, I was playing with two packages, rTorrent and Privoxy.&nbsp; Unfortunately,&nbsp; Privoxy is lacking zlib support, and rTorrent is lacking XMLRPC support (both are compile time options).&nbsp; Now, I realize OpenWRT packages need to be minimalistic, but I&#039;m starting to wonder about the logic in leaving out certain components...</p><p>For Privoxy, without zlib compression filtering won&#039;t work on compressed pages.&nbsp; HTTP compression has been out for a little over a decade now, and is pretty much the rule rather than the exception.&nbsp; You can modify your HTTP headers to disable it, but downloading uncompressed HTML takes about ten times longer.&nbsp; Now, as far as I know, Privoxy&#039;s claim to fame is the ability to filter webpages to make them load more quickly...&nbsp; OpenWRT&#039;s package can&#039;t do this, so I&#039;m not really sure why one would want to use a Privoxy build that can&#039;t filter over one of the other, simpler proxy servers.</p><p>For rTorrent, XMLRPC seems to be a requirement to use any of the various web GUIs.&nbsp; Now, I suppose rTorrent works alright without a web GUI, but personally I&#039;d rather control it from a webpage rather than ssh&#039;ing into my router and keeping the ssh connection open for the next week or so while it downloads.&nbsp; In any case, it seems like web GUIs on routers are popular enough to justify a larger binary and an extra dependency...</p><p>I would presume there are more packages missing rather vital features, but these are the ones I&#039;ve found with the latest Kamikaze build without explicitly looking.&nbsp; Now, I&#039;m kinda wondering about the logic here...&nbsp; Is it just negligence on the part of the package creator in not reading up on the various compile options?&nbsp; Or are these exclusions deliberate for reasons of which I&#039;m ignorant?</p><p>(My logic in posting this:&nbsp; If it&#039;s the former then it can be corrected for future builds and other packages, if it&#039;s the latter then I won&#039;t need to waste my time in attempting to recompile these two packages.)</p>									</div>
