					<p>Like i said, here&#039;s an almost perfectly working build for the WRT610N (V1)</p><p>Ok... First the disclamer, you&#039;re on your own with this, absolutly no support and don&#039;t complain if it eat your dog, brick your router or anything else... I am just making this avalable because i hope it can help, but it may pretty much do the exact opposite...</p><p>Before even thinking installing this in your wrt610n, backup everything twice, install a serial interface, and do anything elsse imaginable to be able to return your router to a good working state...</p><p>What is include in this firmware :</p><p>Lan/Wan port works perfectly (so far, i didn&#039;t tested it much, but i get gigabit speeds)<br />WiFi 2.4Ghz work in B/G mode.<br />WiFi 5Ghz doesn&#039;t work (it work like a second 2.4Ghz interface in B/G mode with a bad anteina)<br />USB 2 work (The firmware build i made has everything needed to access USB storage formatted in ext2/3/4 Fat or NTFS)<br />LuCi is build-in too.</p><p>I have two images avalable :</p><p><a href="http://openwrt.beaupre.biz/attitude_adjustment/r34879/brcm47xx/openwrt-wrt610n_v1-squashfs.bin">http://openwrt.beaupre.biz/attitude_adj … uashfs.bin</a><br /><a href="http://openwrt.beaupre.biz/attitude_adjustment/r34879/brcm47xx/openwrt-wrt610n_v1-jffs2.bin">http://openwrt.beaupre.biz/attitude_adj … -jffs2.bin</a></p><p>Unless you know what you&#039;re doing, use the squashfs one.</p><p>Once it&#039;s installed you will need to change one setting in /etc/opkg.conf if you want to be able to install kernel modules for this build :</p><p>Locate the src/gz line (normally the firsst line) and change it to :</p><p>src/gz attitude_adjustment <a href="http://openwrt.beaupre.biz/attitude_adjustment/r34879/brcm47xx/packages">http://openwrt.beaupre.biz/attitude_adj … x/packages</a></p><p>Or, leave the original one there and add a second one under it looking like this :</p><p>src/gz attitude_adjustment_r34879 <a href="http://openwrt.beaupre.biz/attitude_adjustment/r34879/brcm47xx/packages">http://openwrt.beaupre.biz/attitude_adj … x/packages</a></p><p>It doesn&#039;t change much if you do the first or second method, almost all packages are avalable in my build repository (there is 3 package missing : appweb, telepathy-python and logtrigger, because they gave me some errors and it was really not a priority for me to fix the errors in those packages)</p><p>I hope this can be helpful...</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve been running 3 WRT610n V1 with DD-WRT for some years which I&#039;m now gradually replacing with TP-LINK devices running OpenWrt (a WDR 4900, a WDR 4300 and a 1043ND). I&#039;m now taking one of the 610ns for toying around with OpenWrt, too.

The 610n has CFE V 1.0.37.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried both Hywkar&#039;s image (thanks for that!) and a custom Barrier Breaker trunk build (r36237).</p><p>So far, I&#039;ve noticed the following:</p><p>a) Switch port 1 just does not work at all as soon as the roboswitch driver is loaded -- it seems to be completely deactivated, no link is established.

					<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>Is there anything new on this topic? I see that in the official openwrt WRT610n page (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt610n">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt610n</a>) the build trunk r36099 is supported for the wrt610n V1. Will it really work on my WRT610nV1 (apart from the 5GHz band)? </p><p>I&#039;m asking this because I already tried to flash it and it bricked my router... Maybe I did something stupid but I want to be sure that the build won&#039;t brick it again if I try once more. It was a real pain to unbrick it and I want to be very careful now. Can I flash it directly from the official linksys firmware or do I have to flash something else before?</p><p>Thanks for your answers,</p>									</div>

					<p>I flashed barrier breaker (r36944) onto my v1 router, and it runs with only two issues.&nbsp; Port 1 is still disabled as per Ollis bug report, and I haven&#039;t been able to get 40Mhz channels working correctly.&nbsp; I am using the proprietary wl driver because I needed the 5Ghz channels, so the version I&#039;m running is one I compiled myself so I didn&#039;t have the drivers (or many of the packages) I didn&#039;t need compiled in.&nbsp; But I did try flashing the trunk build and it did boot directly.&nbsp; I flashed it originally using the recovery page, detailed here <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Linksys_WRT610N#Recovery_.28Unbricking.29">http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Li … ricking.29</a> however at some point when I was experimenting with various builds, the recovery page became unresponsive.&nbsp; Luckily I had a serial interface handy so I was able to connect that up, interrupt the boot process and manually put it into tftp mode.&nbsp; Having a serial interface is a pretty handy safety net, so I do recommend having one before you flash it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Knasher</strong> on 8 Jul 2013, 18:05)</p>

					<p>If you have a (factory-) firmware smaller than 3&#039;412&#039;000 bytes (current trunk snapshots, without LuCI, might fit - the vendor firmware, OpenWrt releases or -rcs including LuCI do not), tftp should work. If it fails, go with the serial option (see <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=51530">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=51530</a> for details).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>slh</strong> on 21 Aug 2014, 22:39)</p>
