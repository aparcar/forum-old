					<p>First idea: Set up some VPN. Use a single public IP to set up a VPN server and connect all routes to that VPN. That single public IP can either be a cheap VPS in a data center or one router that has a public IP address.</p><p>But a better answer clearly requires more information about what you currently have and what you&#039;re trying to do.</p>									</div>

					<p>You most likely find OpenVPN to be the one with most documentation available and widely used.<br />Or you can use tincVPN which I prefer since it&#039;s damn easy as soon you realize how things work together.</p><p>Both of them are free.</p><p>But none of them are &quot;services&quot;, you need at least one public IP the others can connect to.</p>									</div>
