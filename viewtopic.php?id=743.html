					<p>Hi <br />Sorry for the newbie /long post but I&#039;ve been struggling with this for 20+ hours and feel like breaking the damn router. I&#039;ve got v1.0 WRT54GS. I was looking to install&nbsp; the sveasoft firmware (have 6.0rc3 installed on another WRT54G and working fine). <br />1) I updated the router to 3.37 (Linksys firmware) (first flash had failed)<br />@) Then tried updating it to SveaSoft&#039;s 4.0 and 6.0 without any success. <br />3) Finally managed to install OpenWRT, the command line was a bit more then I had bargained for :oops: . I basically wanted to use OpenWRT to upgrade to Sveasoft since the Linksys firmware wasnt accepting the updates via the web interface and tftp was working but changes werent saved. </p><p>4) After OpenWRT was installed tftp died (timeouts... I ran ethereal and it was spitting out destination unreachable messages)<br />5)&nbsp; I tried disabling iptables and trying again with no luck (but was able to ping now).<br />6) I tried the hard reset but somehow the reset button seems disabled, pressing it does nothing<br />7) According to the manual I used wget to pull a firmware to /tmp and then dd to strip off the first 32 bytes and an mtd write, unfortunately kept getting bad crc errors (on multiple firmwares)</p><p>Commands I used are</p><br /><p>wget -O /tmp/WRT54GS_3.17.4_US_code.bin <a href="http://www.neduet.com/WRT54GS_3.17.4_US_code.bin">http://www.neduet.com/WRT54GS_3.17.4_US_code.bin</a></p><br /><p>dd bs=16 skip=2 if=WRT54GS_3.17.4_US_code.bin of=WRT54GS_3.17.4_US_code.trx</p><p>mtd write /tmp/WRT54GS_3.17.4_US_code.trx linux &amp;&amp; reboot</p><p>I also tried updating the ipkg list but the file in which I had to add (/etc/ipkg?) other package addresses was read only with no chmod being available</p><p>Is there some other way to update the firmware to a Sveasoft firmware or am I doing something wrong? Any and all help would be greatly appreciated. </p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Sounds like you&#039;re struggling like I was.. For some 50-odd people to read this and not give you the slightest advice is disappointing.</p><p>OK, I&#039;m going to assume you haven&#039;t read the OpenWRT user guide, or FAQs.</p><p>The first thing you need to do is get tftp working again, I reckon.&nbsp; It sounds like you still have access to the WRT, console-wise, so that should be easy enough.&nbsp; From the OpenWRT console, type:</p><p>nvram set boot_wait=on</p><p>Then, verify with:</p><p>nvram get boot_wait</p><p>it should return with: &quot;on&quot;</p><p>then type:</p><p>nvram commit</p><p>wait for that process to finish, it&#039;ll take a few seconds...Then you&#039;ll have tftp again.&nbsp; I suggest you get it back to a Linksys firmware first, to verify it&#039;s all good.</p><p>Read the &quot;Getting Started&quot; tips here </p><p><a href="http://www.openwrt.org">http://www.openwrt.org</a>./GettingStartedTips</p><p>To learn more about OpenWRT.&nbsp; I am a Linux midget but now have my WRT singing!&nbsp; Actually I find it to be more robust than the Sveasoft, and much leaner. Give it a try!!</p><p>Hope this helps</p><p>Cheers,<br />J</p>									</div>

					<p>tftp won&#039;t accept files bigger than 3 mb. flashing to sveasoft&#039;s (free) satori, booting it, then flashing to the original firmware via the web interface should do the trick. if satori supports the wrt54gs unit.</p><p>if not, you&#039;ll have to do it from the openwrt&#039;s cli. use the search feature (on both the forum and the wiki), there should be instructions somewhere.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Guys,</p><p>This is a long shot, but has anyone any advice for this bricked router problem? After flashing a corrupt firmware, the WRT54G v2.2 became unresponsive. Telnet failed and I could not ping it. So after all the usual contingencies, I shorted pins 15-16 and was able to ping the router. Then I was also able during the 3 sec failsafe period to TFTP the original Linksys firmware up into the router (in binary mode). The TFTP finished and the router rebooted, after which all the normal lights came back on (power, LAN and Wireless). BUT I cannot ping the router on default IP 192.168.1.1 and I can&#039;t telnet into it, neither can I access a Linksys web interface. It appears as it was before the TFTP. </p><p>If anyone has any advice on this please let me know. I don&#039;t really want a new blue and black paperweight, but as things are going at the moment, that is what I am going to have.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Niall</p>									</div>
