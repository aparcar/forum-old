					<p>About a year ago I did a bit of research and decided the Linksys WRTSL54GS had as impressive a feature list as any wireless router.<br />It&#039;s a really cool little box. It has as much CPU and memory as any router of the time. (I haven&#039;t looked to see if they&#039;re better now, but a year ago the trend was for slower, less-memory routers), a USB port, and runs OpenWRT just fine. Its only major problem was that its antenna isn&#039;t removable. That was no biggie for me b/c I don&#039;t want any longer range and if I ever do, heck, even I can solder an antenna!</p><p>So I bought 2. One for my place, one for Dad&#039;s.<br />And had problems pretty quickly with both.</p><p>I used them for a while with the Linksys firmware.<br />And dad and I both had wireless connection drops. Especially him, I didn&#039;t use the wireless much.<br />So I tried changing the wifi channel settings. No change.<br />So I switched routers with him.<br />No change, we both still had occaisonal drops, especially him, usually on the order of a quick drop every other day.<br />When I&#039;m home if I push a lot of data (like copying CD images or VMs) over the wireless, it drops very often. Every 10 minutes sometimes.</p><p>So I put OpenWRT on his router.<br />I&#039;d planned on doing that eventually anyway and now I had a really good excuse for it.<br />But there was no change.<br />The router dropped connection as often w/ OpenWRT as it did w/ the Linksys firmware.<br />I&#039;ve also tried leaving the router out with a fan blowing on it to try to see if heat was a problem and it drops just ask often, about once every other day.</p><p>I see the release notes for the latest Kamakazi [ <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/7.09/release.txt">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/7.09/release.txt</a> ] say:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>There are 10 supported architectures listed below, with support for many<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; more in progress. Almost all of these platforms are based on 2.6 kernels<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; with the exception of Broadcom -- Sorry; we couldn&#039;t get a stable wifi<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; connection on 2.6.</p></blockquote></div><p>And I see my Linksys WRTSL54GS&#039;s use Broadcom.</p><p>Are Broadcom chips just problematic? I see my Dell laptop from 2005 has a Broadcom WiFi adapter that works well enough.</p><p>Anyway, bottom line, what are the &#039;best&#039; routers out there for the new OpenWRT?</p>									</div>

					<p>There was a problem with the older Broadcom drivers for a while.</p><p>This affected Linksys factory firmware equally with WhiteRussian as they used the same binary drivers.</p><p>I recall someone had found a way to wedge the very latest Broadcom drivers into the WhiteRussian build and it worked just fine.</p><p>I loaded Kamikaze 7.09 with 2.4 kernel and haven&#039;t had any problems I think it must use more recent Broadcom binary driver also.</p><p>Supposedly the open-source b43 driver will make this all go away whenever that gets finished.</p>									</div>

					<p>Also I am looking strongly at &quot;Wiligear.com&quot; devices, they look quite good and a lot more room for expansion.&nbsp; The consumer space is pretty dead these days routers just seem to keep getting tighter on flash &amp; RAM.</p>									</div>

					<p>Vincent! You&#039;re still&nbsp; here!<br />You were so helpful last year when I was going through this same thing!<br />I&#039;m thrilled to see you&#039;re still alive and apparently well!</p><p>Putting Kamikaze 7.09 with the 2.4 kernel on the router I&#039;ve got (still under original firmware) shouldn&#039;t be a problem.<br />In the next week I&#039;ll try to push data through the wireless until it drops, then put Kamikaze 7.09 with the 2.4 kernel on it and see how much data I can push through it again.<br />I&#039;ll take notes and post what I find in a new thread.<br />Let me know if there&#039;s a more appropiate place to put my findings.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yep, but I only check in occasionally.</p><p>I acquired a little tax deduction, and he takes up my hobby time of late. My last obsession was tracking down those dadgum GPIO 2&amp;3 locations on the SL.&nbsp; Took me hours with a multimeter probing all over.&nbsp; I tried tackling RAM upgrade I think it could go to 128 megs but the soldering turned out to be over my head and I ruined a router.&nbsp; I really haven&#039;t done much with it since.</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WRTSL54GS">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har … /WRTSL54GS</a></p><p>I&#039;d be interested to see a note somewhere in the WRTSL54GS Wiki page, which I&#039;ve enjoyed contributing to.&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps expand the section a little bit on firmware and note the issues with WhiteRussian versus Kamikaze.&nbsp; There&#039;s not really a &quot;right&quot; place for it I can find.</p><p>So I&#039;ve got 2 SL units modded with the serial console stereo-plug thanks to NetPrince great idea, and dual USB ports.&nbsp; One is my house router and the other was the original experimental SL unit that I keep as a spare.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to have modded them further but thinking now it&#039;s just not worth the hassles. I&#039;ll probably retire these and move on to new project.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m looking strongly at those Wiligear devices I&#039;d like a little beefier more capable router running OpenWRT.&nbsp; I also want to be able to run an 802.11a (5-gig) AP and it looks like their WDB-111 will fill that role for me.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 15 Feb 2008, 22:39)</p>

					<p>Now that looks like fun!<br />I was totally sold on the whole idea of buying the case, wifi card, system board, and antenna and putting them together... until I saw the $175 pricetag. And they&#039;re out of stock to boot!<br />Why exactly are these things so expensive?<br />Looks like the bulk of the price is in ~$125 system board that&#039;s on there. And the ~$40 mini PCI card.</p>									</div>

					<p>Actually, I think that red message actually means they are in stock, it was there when I ordered mine.</p><p>The board looks to be good quality, and it destroys my wrt54gs when it comes to ram and storage, and probably processing power too.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping it will work out well after I get openwrt on it.</p>									</div>
