					<p>stel,</p><p>I don&#039;t think you need the hw-sim module, that is probably why you have the extra wireless interface. If you start by selecting ath9k in menuconfig all dependencies will be satisfied--you don&#039;t have to select mac80211 or anything else for wireless.</p>									</div>

					<p>well i can tell you that i sync up to the gb ports at 1gb (ethtool reports) but i think i screwed up the network config so i can&#039;t run a speed test for you let alone get into the damn thing. plus the serial port is male so i need a null modem cable to get on console which i don&#039;t have. sux. i was trying to get 2 SSIDs going so i have a public one that doesn&#039;t hit my LAN. i was very careful and i didn&#039;t mess with the WAN settings so i can always get into the box from there but no go. i find it on the network (hte IP on the WAN port) but ssh and http don&#039;t respond. one of the SSIDs show up though i can&#039;t associate with it even with static IP settings. what to do?</p><p>actually an nmap scan gives me this.</p><p>All 100 scanned ports on 192.168.2.189 are filtered</p><p>nevermind. i flashed it with a fresh jffs.bin. there was a newer one anyway and i monkeyed with it enough to start from scratch. note that &#039;option overlay_root /jffs&#039; in /etc/opkg.conf should be commented out with this version for some reason. there&#039;s no /jffs partition mounted so i think without this option packages get installed on root. could be a difference between the squashfs and jffs2 binaries. anywa i&#039;ve got a few issues but it&#039;s too let to get into them now.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stel</strong> on 4 Jan 2010, 10:10)</p>

					<p>i&#039;ve got it all installed again. weird that i could configure the radio with luci but it showed no BSSID though the scan function in luci worked so i know the radio was working and drivers were all there. but i could not see the SSID from my laptop (kubuntu). so i installed hostap, hostap-utils, hostapd, hostapd-utils and then i see the SSID from my laptop but i cannot associate with it (get error cannot associate with AP - from wicd) and also the scan function from within luci stopped working. weirdness. am i missing some package still? you&#039;d think the default openwrt binary was set up for an access point already.</p>									</div>

					<p>arrgghh i just cannot get the RSPro with R52N card to broadcast 2 SSIDs. what the hell am i doing wrong? check out my configs. i think it has something to do with the insistence that a wlan1 interface is created when i create the second wireless entry (publicwifi). i&#039;ve tried assigning the network public to eth1, eth1.1, wlan0, wlan1 all with the same effect. note that ifconfig never shows wlan1 but ifconfig -a does. well after an ifconfig wlan1 up it shows but still no ssid broadcast. btw it works right away on my nanostation2 with not-so-latest kamikazee. i&#039;ll upgrade it and see if it breaks.</p><p>wireless</p><p>config &#039;wifi-device&#039;

					<p>yes, the system installed has the gui broken (you can fix by installing a couple of luci packages - see posts on this forum) but i don&#039;t think the system on there is upgradeable via the gui anyway. for one the opkg.conf file has an error. anyway tftp methos is easy and adequately documented in this forum.</p>									</div>

					<p>i&#039;ve got the microtik R52n ($32 at streakwave.com then /www.titanwirelessonline.com for antennas and pigtails) and the specs are pretty rockin, 2.4Ghz and 5.3/5.8Ghz, 25db, latest atheros chipset. but i&#039;m having a few problems i&#039;m right now guessing are because of an immature ath9k/mac80211 driver. i can&#039;t get multiple SSIDs going. i have a nanostation2 as well (uses madwifi for it&#039;s atheros radio) and it does multiple SSIDs no sweat. then i can&#039;t get it to go into N mode. just started looking into it but damn this stuff should just work. also &quot;auto&quot; for channel select won&#039;t work nor will scanning.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stel</strong> on 11 Jan 2010, 06:17)</p>
