					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to set my printer to only allow access to computers that are connected to the network. My printer is connected directly to the router. All the computers in the office has the same subnet. However, I know that there is a range from 0-255. I want to only allow my office computers to have access to the printer and no one else. How would I do that?</p><p>I&#039;m thinking it would be something that allow devices connected to the routher through ethernet or WiFi to be able to access the printer. But how would I set that?</p><p>Thank you for your time.</p>									</div>

					<p>well you can just isolate your office computers to a separate subnet, while others is on another subnet</p><p>or</p><p>if youre printer is connected via USB and using a cups to share the printer over the network, you can actually put a iptables rule to allow only certain MAC addresses or IP range or selected IPs to only access the shared printer.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m a bit confused, are you saying that the &quot;other offices&quot; are connected to your router?<br />If not, there&#039;s no problem as the 192.168.1 subnets are local to each router.</p>									</div>
