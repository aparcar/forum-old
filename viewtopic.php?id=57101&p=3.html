					<p>Good news, I think I found a solution (sort of)! You can do a regular search with the negation of a word. If that word is a tag, pages with that tag is will not be returned. For example, let&#039;s say we want to get the all pages without the &quot;4700&quot; tag. If you go to the search box and put in -4700, you&#039;re results will be at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/start?do=search&amp;id=-4700">http://wiki.openwrt.org/start?do=search&amp;id=-4700</a>. At first it&#039;ll say which pagenames match but the list after that, will show all the pages without &quot;4700&quot; in them.</p><p>This will work okay if we have a relatively unique tag. If you want to get all the pages without a tag like &quot;tutorial,&quot; you&#039;re going to exclude any pages which includes the word &quot;tutorial&quot; somewhere in the document, not just as a tag. If we mark everything as outdated or not outdated though, we&#039;ve added a tag to every page, both of which we can set to be included in the tag search tool that was shown earlier.</p><p>Wow, what a confusing process <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

To do that, I propose each wiki page that&#039;s not hardware documentation with tags for whether it includes a &quot;tutorial&quot;, &quot;guide&quot; or &quot;reference&quot;.

I see these major tasks:</p><ol class="decimal"><li><p>The OpenWrt home page and top level wiki pages stink out loud (for my reasoning, see issue #12 &amp; 13). We need to fix these before diving into leaf pages:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/prplfoundation/openwrt-doc-initiative/issues/12">https://github.com/prplfoundation/openw … /issues/12</a><br /><a href="https://github.com/prplfoundation/openwrt-doc-initiative/issues/13">https://github.com/prplfoundation/openw … /issues/13</a><br /></p></li><li><p>We should coordinate with the folks who are working to fix the Table of Hardware page, as that page is integral to helping people succeed.</p></li><li><p>In addition, it would be valuable to spruce up in the home page/wiki in advance/as part of the Chaos Calmer release. See <a href="https://github.com/prplfoundation/openwrt-doc-initiative/issues/14">https://github.com/prplfoundation/openw … /issues/14</a></p></li><li><p>Finally, we need to figure out how to create and present the newly edited text to the core-developers. (Normal members cannot edit the top level pages.) glp has offered to pass our suggestions along, but we will need to have fairly well-formed pages for them to consider.</p></li></ol>									</div>

					<p>Chaos Calmer rc1 is now available. See my note on Github about the updated draft home page (<a href="https://github.com/prplfoundation/openwrt-doc-initiative/issues/12">https://github.com/prplfoundation/openw … /issues/12</a>) </p><p>New questions: As the CC release comes into focus, there are a number of other documentation-related questions to be addressed. My list:</p><p>- What features should be tested? (All of them, of course.) But are there things that the developers would like to see get more testing than others?</p><p>- Is there any documentation on the wiki, the forum (or even links to developer discussion threads) that can be linked from the specified features mentioned in the CC release note? </p><p>- Is LuCI included with CC rc1? (It was not built-in previously, but I would have thought it would be, since it is with Barrier Breaker)</p><p>- It&#039;s so cool that SQM/fq_codel is featured in the release notes. Is it installed and enabled by default? Given that every new OpenWrt install should probably install it, it would be good to make it automatic since it minimizes the number of steps of the SQM guide at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/sqm">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/sqm</a></p><p>There are other questions that aren&#039;t directly related to CC, but that arise when talking about updates to the documentation and web site:</p><p>- What about security updates? Is there a mechanism for detecting that security-related updates are available? What recommendations do we provide for people to stay patched up?</p><p>- Are there plans to add Google Analytics to the home page, wiki, and forum? These would give us information about things that are useful for visitors, or not-so... </p><p>My questions to you:</p><p>- What other questions/comments/requests are important for improving documentation in the Chaos Calmer release timeframe? </p><p>- Would it be true that members of this team would be willing to take on the work of updating the documentation if we knew what to say?</p><p>I am willing to bring these questions to the core developers, but I want to be sure that I&#039;ve collected the most important ones (at least for this team) and that we can be seen as helpful, not as complaining.

					<p>Final/stable versions will have Luci installed. I believe 12.09-rc1 and 14.07-rc1 did not, but it was added in rc2. Only way to find out is to try 15.05-rc1! I wouldn&#039;t recommend rc1 anyway, which is why I&#039;m waiting personally. There&#039;s nothing in there that I&#039;m desperate to get access to. </p><p>I hope SQM is actually integrated but I kinda doubt it.</p>									</div>
