					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I want to use my Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH as a bridge/repeater on my home WLAN (which runs on an Apple Time Capsule), to be able to connect a computer on a different floor without laying cables.</p><p>Ideally the Buffalo would act as a transparent bridge, with the LAN-side on the same network segments as the other computers in my house, and the Time Capsule DHCP server able to answer requests for devices on the LAN-side of the Buffalo.</p><p>Is OpenWRT or DD-WRT the best bet for this scenario? Is there a HOWTO that covers this?</p><p>I tried to configure masqueraded client mode as per <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedclient#using.masquerade">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/rou … masquerade</a> on a freshly installed OpenWrt image, for starters, but already at the early &quot;configuration&quot; section, the &quot;uci&quot; command did not react according to what the wiki was suggesting.</p><p>Any hints will be greatly appreciated, regards,</p><p>- Sidney</p>									</div>

					<p>This is similar to what I have setup, I have one WZR-HP-G300NH running as a WDS AP and three WZR-HP-G300NH&#039;s running as WDS Stations, creating a &#039;wired&#039; transparent bridge through the house. Since the entire location is within range of the primary router, there is no need to do any rebroadcasting of the wireless signals, which lowers the bandwidth available. Let me know if you need any more information.</p>									</div>
