					<p>I bricked my third router and this time I am having different problems. I installed RC4 and could not login with username/password even after setting password with telnet (no webpage login, telnet or ssh login). So I erased nvram and rebooted, same problem and tftp wouldn&#039;t work. I erased wholeflash/nvram/cfe and reflashed cfe. All I got then was a blinking power light. I can power it up a 100 times and just get a blinking power light, then I leave it alone for 8 or 10 hours and when I power it up again and I got openwrt rc4 again. So after 2 more days of hacking away at this I was able to tftp linksys firmware which I used and set up but when I repowered up it failed with only a blinking light and when it did finally boot I did a factory reset and got a blinking power light and then I got a redirect to a weif page when it booted.</p>									</div>

					<p>Con&#039;t......<br />Iwas able to get the linksys page up again but still am having trouble with booting. I didn&#039;t short any pins or do any thing physical to the unit (wrt54gs ver 1).&nbsp; Responses to my questions here are rare it seems but I am still hoping that someone can help me here.<br />I think I need to clean nvram and do something to the filesysem as it still has traces of openwrt even after a tftp of new software and maybe a serial port mod might be best at seeing what is going on in the boot process.</p>									</div>
