					<p>(I have two 1043ND (1.0) here and ran them with different software (ddwrt, gargoyle, openwrt CC) but my periodical wifi drops did not disappear. Now wife and daughter request a solution :-) )</p><p>Can you recommend a wireless router which ensures the following:<br />- Capability to run with openwrt (and probably with ddwrt, too)<br />- Stable performance (no issues) :-)<br />- Very good WLAN-performance<br />- Probably 2,4 GHz and 5,0 GHz simultaneously<br />- No problems with AirPrint (Fritzbox 4020 did cause known problems here)<br />- I am at Call&amp;Surf-comfort at Deutsche Telekom (if you suggest router with modem)<br />- Buyable at amazon.de or in Aachen, Germany</p><p>Who has got an idea?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>virk</strong> on 4 May 2016, 08:50)</p>

					<p>The router is very close (20 cm) to the base of the DECT-phone.<br />- Do you think this could be the cause?<br />- Concerning router recommendation I will study your links this evening :-)</p>									</div>
