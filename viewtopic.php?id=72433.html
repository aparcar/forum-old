					<p>All,<br />first time here, not sure this is the right place but I hope you all indulge me.</p><p>I am in the process of developing a device which is controlled by a PC via TCP. I envision the device to contain a router.<br />If I connect my PC and the device to the same router on the AN side all is well. However, to network several devices to the same PC I will need the following topology:</p><br /><p>PC -----&nbsp; Main Router&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -----------&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Device1 Router ---- Device 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -----------&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Device2 Router -- Device 2</p><p>The devices are connected to the LAN ports on the Device routers, the device router WAN ports are connected to a LAN port on the Main Router as well as the PC. the main router&#039;s LAN is 192.168.1.0, the device routers use 10.0.69.0<br />Each device router has a static IP for the device and incoming traffic is routed to the device. It&#039;s WAN IP is obtained via DHCP from the main router.</p><p>I connect to the devices on ports 55001 and 55002 and this all works fine (port forwarding works after I figured out thanks to a post that I have to Masquerade the Lan -&gt; WAN zones)</p><p>Here are the problems:</p><p>1) The PC sends a broadcast (255.255.255.255) on port 55100 using UDP and all devices are supposed to answer. I use this to discover what&#039;s out there (custom message, none of the established discovery protocols)<br /> Problem: this packet never gets to my devices and the cannot answer.&nbsp; I tried to forward port 55100 also, doesn&#039;t work.</p><p>2) Each device is supposed to connect to the PC on a unique port (55003 - 55099) to be able to send messages to the PC. This does not work at all: when my code on device1 or device2 tries to connect a socket back to the device, I get an &quot;unreachable host&quot; exception.<br />I presume there is something with IP tables but I cannot figure it out.</p><p>Obviously, both, the main and device routers run OpenWrt.</p><p>If anybody has any ideas what&#039;s wrong and which - if any - custom firewall settings I might need, I would appreciate any help I can get.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>My two cents:</p><p>1) Broadcast packets do not cross routers. You should configure the router as a bridge instead (and have just one big network), or listen to the broadcast messages on the router, or do some kind of special forwarding that I do not about. You could be tempted to use &quot;relayd&quot; (as it was designed specifically to relay broadcast packets), but take into consideration other broadcast messages (such as DHCP, for example).</p><p>2) Are the device routers to masquerade traffic or just route it? Is the PC configured to accept traffic from a 10.x.y.z network?</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the reply.</p><p>1) I am not sure I can use bridged since the main router may be a customer router and it is my understanding that my device routers in this case would need to know the main router&#039;s IP?<br />&quot;Relayed&quot; sounds good since my PC is except for my own broadcast oblivious to anything else. Any idea how to configure this?</p><p>2) The outside PC should not &quot;know&quot; about the 10.x.y.z network, just about the main router</p>									</div>

					<p>You are creating a dogs-breakfast of networking. Trying to do NAT traversal with your two routers is creating an unnecessarily complex configuration. I would suggest:<br />1) turning off NAT on your routers, and entering static routes (or run a routing protocol like RIP/OSPF) so that Device 1 can get to Device 2 (in your drawing)<br />2) moving to IPv6, which doesn&#039;t have NAT, and will be compatible with networks into the next century.</p>									</div>
