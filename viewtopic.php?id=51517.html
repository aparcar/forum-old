					<p>Hi developers.</p><p>As Linux is now using <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/networking/">iproute2</a> for network configuration, it&#039;s better for OpenWRT to use iproute2 for it. I don&#039;t mean to replace OpenWRT netifd automated network configuration. Here is my explanation.</p><p>Busybox compiled within default makefile is still using ifconfig for manual network configuration. Net-tools (ifconfig) has become obsolete and no longer works on modern network interface, for example some Android phone.</p><p>I wonder if Busybox will include minimal version of iproute2 instead of the legacy ifconfig. Ifconfig should be dropped from busybox and replaced by minimal version of iproute2.</p><p>I know for sure. To install iproute2, package ip need to be selected from OpenWRT build configuration (menuconfig).<br />This standalone iproute costs a lot of disk usage, around 150 kB in my case with OpenWRT trunk compiled for TP Link MR3220 which only has 4MB of flash.</p><p>If minimal version of iproute2 could be part of busybox, this will greatly save disk space and will adhere to <a href="http://en.tldp.org/HOWTO/Adv-Routing-HOWTO/">Linux networking standard</a>.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think more developers are reading the mailing list.<br />Afaik that problem is known to devs - since there is already an ip-tiny packet without some exotic features but your post need some improvements.</p><p>Some things need further clarifications and possibly corrections; issues with your statements:</p><p>- ifconfig might be technically obsolete - thats not a reason to stop its use (&quot;bad&quot; example: Kernel 3.3.x in AA is EOL and OpenWrt does not even provide possible security backports)<br />- OpenWrt is not running on Android<br />- What makes the network interface &quot;modern&quot; - can you clarify?</p><p>- iproute2 proposal was rejected in 2013, see for example:<br /><a href="http://patchwork.openwrt.org/patch/4035/">http://patchwork.openwrt.org/patch/4035/</a> for arguments <br />- there is already an iproute2 tiny patch:https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/39119<br />- afaik some busybox ip syntax is incompatible with iproute2</p><p>Please note that the discussion contains hard numbers comparing these scenarios down to a single bytes. (you dont provide new numbers)</p><p>Afaik netifd is responsible for up/down of interfaces - the same role ifconfig/ip plays in some scripts so there is some overlap. And netifd will not go away.</p>									</div>

					<p>The patchwork debate changes my mind.<br />It&#039;s better to not include ifconfig or ip on network interface setup scripts at all and optimize netifd implementation for those functions.</p><p>I can&#039;t provide any explanation about modern interface. As far as I know, modern interfaces use netlink for its configuration backend, and iproute2 seems to have a better handling for netlink.</p><p>I think it&#039;s better to stay with ip-tiny package to provide iproute2 functionality and ip-tiny package should be added to base system in addition to busybox ifconfig.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>alive4ever</strong> on 9 Jul 2014, 11:21)</p>
