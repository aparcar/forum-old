					<p>YDEF -</p><p>The pinouts are fine.&nbsp; Does this TI AR7 chip support DMA transactions?&nbsp; Also - to get JTAG working - it should be quite easy, assuming the chip&#039;s EJTAG support is at 2.0 and not at the 2.5 or 2.6 standard - as those don&#039;t support DMA EJTAG transactions.&nbsp; If so - then the Debrick Utility can be moddified quite easily to support this chip as well.&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Cheers,<br />-hairydairymaid</p>									</div>

					<p>I have just brought a linksys WRTP54G-AU it has the unlocked AU/NZ Firmware.&nbsp; I would like to back it up. So I can post it here and other places for people who currently have a locked down version of the firmware. And also so when I start playing around with my firmware I can get back to my current firmware. I know I have seen a way posted somewhere that did it from the cmd line but I cannot find it now. I am very familiar with routers and networking and windows but am relatively new to Linux so any guides would be great. I am also keen to know the status of porting openWRT to this router and if there is anything I can do to help with this. Thanks :-)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>humvee</strong> on 23 Aug 2006, 07:50)</p>
