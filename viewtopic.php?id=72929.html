					<p>Update: Serial connector arrived today - will see if i can connect with that.... also seems there is a bug when setting LED to Pwr - precisely what I did.... dev.openwrt.org/ticket/18318 - cannot open this as cert expired - but reading highlevel its precisely what i did that killed the little box.... ffs.</p><p>so - next up: finding a PCB short that reset the whole unit to factory default (cant find anything to this effect) OR push on with Serial connector box...</p>									</div>
