					<p>Hello,<br/>continuing my test in order to use gateway6 tunnelling with trunk builds.<br/>I made good improvements:<br/>- gw6c needed to start the tunnel. Tunnel linked to br-lan<br/>- odhcpd correctly performing RA and DHCPv6 services (no radvd needed)<br/>- IPv6 addresses, gateway, dns correctly distributed to the devices on the LAN<br/>- in order to get internet access on IPv6 for the LAN devices had to change settings in the Firewall LAN zone in order to accept forward (reject by default).<br/>Can anybody help me on the following:<br/>- why IPv6 WAN status in Luci status page is reporting not connected? Is it normal due to IPv6 tunnelling and not ISP native?<br/>- Leasetime for IPv6 is set to 1h and I cannot find where I can change this parameter. Leasetime parameter in /etc/config/dhcp seems to work only on IPv4<br/>- Is there any parameter to reservate an IPv6 address to a specific device on the LAN in order to get a static address for some of them?<br/>- Is there any possibility to connect gateway tunnel with one of the standard packages included in the trunk build? I would like to avoid usage of gw6c , but cannot find a solution.<br/>Thanks in advance for the help.<br/>Sergio</p>									</div>

					<p>The time for DHCPv6 leases isn&#039;t really important, the server seems to use a predictable method for generating an address from the given DUID, so as long as that doesn&#039;t change (Which it sometimes can for no discernible reason) you&#039;ll always get the same IPv6 address.</p><p>And because the server currently doesn&#039;t release addresses (Maybe it does now, I need to reflash), it&#039;s really not an issue.</p>									</div>

					<p>hnyman, </p><p>What&#039;s your general approach for matching up kernel packages to your build? I&#039;ve seen it asked a couple times and merely a recommendation to force-depends. For example... kmod-ipt-nathelper-extra could be useful to have around. Granted, a force-depends works fine for that package, but might it be beneficial to maintain kernel specific module builds for your build?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>yardley</strong> on 6 Feb 2014, 18:48)</p>

					<p>I recently switched from arokh Openwrt build for WNDR3700v1 to this one and I noticed a very big difference in WAN to LAN Throughput. I had around 400Mbps and now it does not go above 165Mbps. I am using PPPoE on WAN side and I have 1Gbps connection. Is there something that can be done to fix this ? Thanks hnyman.</p>									</div>

					<p>Regarding kernel modules, I try to not add new modules, just to keep the build simple. I don&#039;t want to complicate things and so I do not try to maintain also a separate packages archive for my build. So only the modules included are available from me. Should you want something else, one sure way is to copy my environment and rebuild it yourself, with the additional packages included.</p><p>Regarding network throughput, I have no idea. My build has the standard networking &amp; wifi components, but so probably did Arokh&#039;s.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks hnyman for your efforts creating this build. I tested it but experience some issues with the WAN port ...<br/>What I&#039;m trying to do is to use either PPPoE or DHCP (if connected to my current router), but neither option seems to work. No IP address is being assigned (though, the default Netgear firmware is able to operate the WAN port, so there should be no hardware fault). Even if using a static address, it does not work.</p><p>The only piece of information I could gather comes from ifconfig:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>eth1      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX  
          UP BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 
          RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)
          Interrupt:5 </code></pre></div><br/><p>and the log files show:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[   22.960000] IPv6: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): eth1: link is not ready</code></pre></div><p>However, this is for IPv6 and should not harm (using IPv4 ...). I&#039;m using the latest trunk version for Barrier Breaker, but the problem occured also using AA.</p>									</div>

Separate one port to its own VLAN and assign that port to a new interface that you then configure to use DHCP and to act as the default route to internet. Search the forum and Openwrt wiki for similar questions. You are probably not the first one to ask that.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>:-) 0p3nWRT_r0ckZ :-) wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I tested it but experience some issues with the WAN port ...<br/>What I&#039;m trying to do is to use either PPPoE or DHCP (if connected to my current router), but neither option seems to work.

					<p>Thank you, those all seem to want to make the wan port into a lan port. My wan port is dead.
