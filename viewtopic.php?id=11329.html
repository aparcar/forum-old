					<p>Hello,</p><p>Yesterday I installed Kamikaze 7.06 on my Asus WL500gP and asterisk 1.4.5 with the GUI.<br />I followed the instructions I found on <a href="http://zandbelt.dyndns.org/asterisk.html">http://zandbelt.dyndns.org/asterisk.html</a> .</p><p>Asterisk is working fine, however I encountered some issues with the GUI.</p><p>The gui installation wizard was never showing the setup steps .. it kept reloading the page; connecting to the asterisk console there were a lot of errors and that was solved by loading the app_system.so module in asterisk.</p><p>After doing this the wizard was loading and I was able to complete some step; however the trunk configuration gave me an error, saying that a file was missing (extensions.conf), while that file was actually in the /etc/asterisk directory.<br />I tried to comment the &quot;TRUNKMSD=1&quot; at the beginning of the file and.. the wizard was able to complete and the GUI seemed to work fine.</p><p>However, it was not working fine as the gui was able to create the extensions and the dialplans correctly, but the trunks were incomplete because for instance the variable &quot;TRUNK_1=SIP/trunk_1&quot; was not set and the dialplan was not working (as it tried to call&nbsp; &quot;/123456&quot; instead of &quot;SIP/trunk_1/123456&quot;).<br />When I set the &quot;TRUNK_1=SIP/trunk_1&quot; manually.. then the GUI stopped working again, redirecting me to the wizard.</p><p>How can I fix this?<br />Am I the only one experiencing this issue?</p><p>Thank you!!</p><p>Regards,<br />Federico</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Just another fix for bad audio.<br />You can check this by setting debug in the console logging in logger.conf.<br />start asterisk with -cvd option (more v&#039;s means more verbose logging , btw -cvvvd)<br />when the are messages about &#039;Overrun on sco_out_buf detected&#039; <br />read following:<br /><a href="http://bugs.digium.com/view.php?id=8919#62973">http://bugs.digium.com/view.php?id=8919#62973</a></p><p>after this, good two way audio</p><p>but excessive delay in audio, about one or two seconds.</p><p>Grts Roel</p>									</div>
