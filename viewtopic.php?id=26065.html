					<p>I&#039;m super stuck here. Any help would be appreciated.</p><p>I&#039;ve built a fresh trunk at r22522 on OS X and had it running right out of the box (well packaged!) and then followed the instructions in the wiki to set up OpenWRT as a routed client using masquerade. The AP doing the managing is an Apple Time Capsule running 802.11n (b/g compat) on 2.5Mhz. I&#039;m using phy0/radio0 for the client link.</p><p>So we have:<br />Client Subnet &lt;==&gt; OpenWRT &lt;==&gt; AP &lt;-&gt; WAN </p><p>So far so good. </p><p><strong>The problem is that the connection barely squeezes out 100k/s as seen from OpenWRT and the client subnet.</strong></p><p>Within the subnet iperf sees a healthy 7Mb/s. So the speeds are:<br />Client Subnet &lt;= 7Mb/s =&gt; OpenWRT &lt;= 100k/s =&gt; AP &lt;-&gt; WAN</p><p>Connecting directly to the AP sees about 1.6Mb/s:<br />Laptop &lt;= 1.6Mb/s =&gt; AP &lt;-&gt; WAN</p><p>When telling the AP to go exclusive 802.11n@5ghz and changing the client interface to radio1 to get 5Ghz I see approx 1Mb/s off the client link, but this is useless as its still only 70% of what I get directly off the AP and none of the 2.5Ghz devices here can connect to the network.</p><p>I&#039;ve spent a couple of nights searching the forums, nagging on IRC and tweaking settings, but the 100k/s stays put.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-device  radio0

					<p>Thanks for the suggestions. I wish I could get rid of masquerading, but I can&#039;t think of a way to get the super friendly Time Capsule to do static routing. Anyway, I see the throughput on the OpenWRT client itself, not only on the boxes behind it that are masqueraded.</p><p>From what I understand QOS aims to prioritize data from different services. To give your skype sessions room in between all your uTorrent packets. I really can&#039;t see it fixing this as QOS can&#039;t address the overall bandwidth available.</p><p>I&#039;m wondering if I should splurge and go for another WNDR3700 in order to run OpenWRT on both endpoints as to have an idea of what is really happening here.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Memphis thanks for the clarification.</p><p>Hi Kipster,<br /> I have spent some time on QoS module, and i have noticed that if its enabled the performance is all but abysmal, at-least with the default config. <br />please try stopping the QoS thingie if its running. if it works as expected then you can try tweaking the QoS rules config file.<br />this happens to me on WNDR3700 and WRT160NL ones... and still worse i cant use web attachments&nbsp; in outlook web based using firefox. anyway...well that&#039;s another case for a new thread.<br />I hope this time I explained it better.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ah, right. Really sorry about the misunderstanding. You know what, that worked! </p><p>I&#039;ve just tried disabling qos (which was included in the default build!) and hey! The speeds jumped from 100k/s to 1.18M/s. That&#039;s just an acceptable 100-200k under the speed I&#039;m getting right off the AP that the WNDR3700 is connected to.</p><p>Thank you very much!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi sorry for the up of the thread, but i have the same problem of the author. Can anyone tell me how to disable this QOS to fixing this issue?<br />Thanks Marco</p><p>P.s. I&#039;ve read the wiki now, i haven&#039;t the package qos-scripts installed, so what should i do in order to fix this problem of different download speed?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>toketin</strong> on 28 Jan 2013, 01:21)</p>
