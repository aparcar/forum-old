					<p>Hi,<br />I am trying to run a video multicast scenario with VLC in a wireless LAN by using OpenWRT firmware. The VLC server and client are in the same subnet and both of them are connected to the Wireless Router (with openWRT firmware).<br />I prepared openWRT image file for Compex board (openwrt-ar71xx-wp543-squashfs-8M-factory.img) and programmed it to use openWRT image.<br />After configuring the hostapd and dhcp in openWRT, client and server will connect to WLAN network. <br />Every time I play a Unicast video stream by means of VLC server, the client can receive the video stream properly and the quality of received video/audio from VLC server is acceptable. But, anytime I try to play a Multicast video stream by using VLC server, the quality of received video/audio in client side is awful and in most of cases I can&#039;t see any clear video and sound <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />It &#039;s obvious that there is something wrong in most of Linux distributions to pass video multicast traffic in wireless networks even when the sender and receiver are in the same subnet. I added the multicast route in the openWRT routing table and also checked some multicast parameters in kernel config, but still this issue is unresolved! <br />I spent too much time to search over google and openWRT forums but no explicit solution has been suggested for this issue.<br />I would like to know is there any one here that has successful experience to rectify this problem?<br />Thanks for your attention</p><p>Regards,<br />Dawood</p>									</div>

					<p>What you experience is an inherent problem with any kinds of multicast traffic on 802.11 networks.<br />Without further configuration, all multicast traffic is sent with 1Mbps or 6Mbps (in G only networks) data rates.</p>									</div>

					<p>In my case, the speed is not problem. I am using 802.11g and there is enough bandwidth among access point, server and client to send and receive multicast video stream,&nbsp; but in addition to mentioned problem in my 1st post, there is a tangible delay between server and client to receive multicast video stream.<br />I am looking for this further configuration that you mentioned...<br />Could you find any solution for it?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Dawood</strong> on 4 Jan 2012, 06:09)</p>

					<p>Thanks fyi for your notice<br />But the mentioned links are not useful for my case!<br />the offered solution in links are based on igmpproxy and this package works for multicast forwarding among different subnets not within a subnet, So I need to find to a solution to receive the video multicast traffic from one user through wireless interface and send it to the other wireless users in the same subnet <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />Do you checked it before?</p>									</div>

					<p>I checked these links but their solution is useful when you are trying to forward multicasr from one subnet to another subnet, but in my case, 2 clients are placed in the same subnet!!!<br />igmpproxy and udpxy could&#039;t solve this problem <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>
