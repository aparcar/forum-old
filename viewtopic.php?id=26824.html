					<p>Hi there,</p><p>I would need an old OpenWRT compatible Router with GPIOs.<br />With this GPIO I want to switch an relay to allow power control of multiple devices via Network.</p><p>Which Router would you recommend for this?</p><p>The Router should never touch the GPIO Line during bootup, otherwise it could touch the relay which would cause an power down (so thats a no go).</p><p>On the other hand, it does not need an internal switch, no wlan or anything else...<br />So as cheap as possible / also old ones ok.</p><p>But if you got an newer one / stocked in shops which is good and well priced, just talk to me</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>DeusEx</p>									</div>
