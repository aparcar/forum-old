					<p>Can I compile ipv6 within the kernel or I need to select it as kernel module in menuconfig?</p><p>Let me explain. I want to run a WRT54G v3 as a mipv6 home agent, and in the usagi group mipv6 documentation it&#039;s said to select &lt;Y&gt; for ipv6 and mipv6 in the kernel menuconfig. However when I do it in openwrt kernel_menuconfig and try to make, an error happens, something related to the cryptographic api. the make process tries to find some crypto kernel modules that doesn&#039;t exist (algapi.ko and others), I think its because they are selected as &lt;y&gt; in kernel menuconfig, I tried to unselect them but they are auto-selected by ipv6/mipv6/ipsec options</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>thiagob</strong> on 20 May 2009, 01:31)</p>
