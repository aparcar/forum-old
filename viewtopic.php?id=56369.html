					<p>I think that you need an input rule for protocol 41 if you use the 6in4 tunnel. Otherwise the incoming new connections might have problem.</p><p>See my old post that shows how I have specified the Sixxs endpoint as the allowed source for prot41 connections:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=254207#p254207">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 07#p254207</a></p><p>EDIT:<br />The reasoning is that the protocol 41 packet is a normal IPV4 packet intended for the router, which either rejects it or accepts it as ipv4. If accepted then the encapsulated ipv6 packet is expanded and forwarded to LAN according to ipv6 firewall rules.
