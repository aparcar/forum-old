					<p>As the title indicates, is there a method with sed and grep, or both?&nbsp; So to make a file with all your installed packages in this format:</p><p>opkg install &lt;package&gt; &lt;package&gt; &lt;package&gt;</p><p>with all the currently installed packages for safe keeping later on?</p>									</div>

					<p>A simple approach would be:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># opkg list-installed | cut -f 1 -d &#039; &#039; &gt; /etc/config/installed_packages.txt</code></pre></div><p>To save all the installed packages into /etc/config/packages_list.txt, /etc/config/* is by default retained through sysupgrades.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># cat /etc/config/installed_packages.txt | opkg install</code></pre></div><p>After sysupgrade, to install all packages.</p><p>A more sophisticated approach can be <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=42739">found here in the forums</a>. I did, however, never use that one myself.</p><p>Keep in mind that even while packages can declare that config files are retained through updates, not all packages do so, or may not even know about files you created yourself in other places. Check /lib/upgrade/keep.d/ for descriptions of files and directories that are retained, and amend if necessary.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 15 May 2014, 01:46)</p>

					<p>Yeah, I discovered that script shortly after posting this. I&#039;ll have to play around with your suggestions and that script.</p>									</div>
