					<p>I had built an Electrocardiogram inside a WRT54G case with my partner Hartley Schroeder for our engineering final project. We&#039;re done the class now, but I thought I&#039;d post the link to the project in case anyone was interested in the files or anything:<br /><a href="http://code.google.com/p/projectguardian/">http://code.google.com/p/projectguardian/</a><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A20e6lwiCK0">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A20e6lwiCK0</a></p><p>The serial into the router was the only part that didn&#039;t work, and unfortunately it was fairy essential for the GPS input (with gpsd) and the microcontroller connection (after failing to get SPI working for our SPI Analog-to-Digital converter). It even had txt message notifications for a sudden drop/rise in heart-rate to the patient or their doctor.</p>									</div>
