					<p>Hi,</p><p>if tried all available FWs for the G3G. So first i&#039;ve tried the &quot;openwrt-wrt54g3g-squashfs.bin&quot;. I was able to flash this FW from the original FW. Then i&#039;ve tried this one:&quot;openwrt-g3g-freifunk-1.5.5-de.bin&quot; - which also works. But now i&#039;m not able to flash any FW anymore. The error-message os always &quot;... wrong .bin format ...&quot;. I&#039;ve tried several versions - without success. I can&#039;t even flash back the original FW...</p><p>Does anyone know why?</p><p>Thanks in advance!<br />Bachelore</p>									</div>
