					<p>To what reason would you like to that?</p><p>If you just wanna show a splash page take nocatsplash ...</p><p>If you wanna have a hotspot network with more advanced features (ie. to manage captive portal content) there is no other way but using a public auth server ...</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes people have been fiddling with this off and on for several years. Most people try the hotspot-in-1-box then run into the limits of the box and go back to a distributed system.&nbsp; It&#039;s quite difficult to get all the pieces running well in a tiny router with it&#039;s very limited resources.&nbsp; RADIUS is one of the frequent complaints, it runs multiple processes and was designed running on a full OS and serving hundreds of users on dialup servers, and supports many attributes that you don&#039;t need for a hotspot. RADIUS is too fat, but no one has sat down to do a &quot;light&quot; version so far as I know.&nbsp; Alternative would be coding your hotspot to use a flat-file for authentication.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 17 May 2006, 23:53)</p>
