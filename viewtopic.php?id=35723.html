					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I am building an image for my HP thin client 5340 and willing to have router up and running right after dd-ing image into device.<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build">Here</a> i can raead following:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Custom files
In many cases, you may want to have a custom image that has been pre-configured to your link. If so, place your custom files in

&lt;buildroot dir&gt;/files/
For example, let&#039;s say that you want an image with a pre-configured /etc/config/firewall, then place your modified firewall config in here:

&lt;buildroot dir&gt;/files/etc/config/</code></pre></div><p>But the question is that some programs need specific permissions to run. For example lcd4linux will not start if permissions of file /etc/lcd4linux.conf will be other than 600.<br />If i&#039;ll put permissions 600 to the original &lt;buildroot dir&gt;/files/etc/lcd4linux.conf, build process will fail complaining that the file is not readable.</p><p>So I am asking help/guide to set correct permissions to the specific files after build has been finished.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>levi</strong> on 23 Mar 2012, 18:39)</p>
