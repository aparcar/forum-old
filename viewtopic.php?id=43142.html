					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I have a D-LINK DIR-825 rev B1 flashed with Attitude Adjustment 12.09-rc1. Beside changing IP and setting gateway + DNS there have been no changes after the initial flashing.</p><p>Afterwards I have been installing the following packages:<br />- kmod-sched<br />- ip<br />- tc<br />- nodogsplash</p><p>When trying to run /etc/init.d/nodogsplash enable it does complete without any return.</p><p>However nodogsplash is not starting. When running ndsctl status I get the following error:</p><p>nodogsplash probably not started (Error: No such file or directory)</p><p>May I ask you if any of you already experienced this issue in the past and if you have been able to fix it?</p><p>Thanks</p><p>PS: I had the same error on this router previously with the latest Backfire build</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ult1m4t3</strong> on 26 Mar 2013, 11:59)</p>

					<p>Thanks robthebrew, I have been actually using this manual to install it but the imq packages are only for Backfire and not in Attitude Adjustment anymore (&quot;IMQ is still in Backfire, but not in Attitude Adjustment any more&quot; - <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/wireless.hotspot.nodogsplash)">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/wirel … dogsplash)</a></p><p>And when having the same issue with my previous Backfire image I had actually the IMQ packages installed.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ult1m4t3</strong> on 26 Mar 2013, 11:00)</p>
