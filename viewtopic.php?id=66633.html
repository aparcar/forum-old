					<p>Hi everyone</p><p>I had OpenWRT designated driver (trunk) running on an Zyxel NGB6616. I tried to update to a new trunk version, but unfortunately it bricked the router. Only the ethernet port was flashing and the router not functioning/responding. </p><p>I wasn&#039;t able to activate failsafe mode, so I copied a new firmware to the router by tftp, which worked. The&nbsp; power LED, Internet&nbsp; and ethernet LED are lighted again (WLAN LED not lighted, but the key symbol is lighted), but router isn&#039;t working. Also no DHCP. After setting PC to 192.168.1.2 and 255.255.255.0 I can ping the router successfully, but no access by telnet/shh (connection refused). I tried this after tftp&#039;ing the original firmware and also the open wrt trunk, no change.</p><p>Does anyone have suggestions how I can get the router running again?</p><p>thanks for any help</p><p>p4p4</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>p4p4</strong> on 8 Aug 2016, 11:39)</p>

					<p>Update: I didn&#039;t wait long enough after tftp upload until I power cycled (about 1min after tftp). Now router is restored and working!</p>									</div>

					<p>another update: it seems to be a problem with the newest designated driver (02. August) for the NBG6616, it bricks the router also over tftp. original firmware world fine.</p>									</div>
