					<p>great work so far. maybe it helps to use some script to trigger special events that you can then measure on the pins of the CPU. So, you would set up your GPIOs in sysfs to ouput and enter the directory of the GPIO you want to detect (i.e. gpio13/).<br />With something like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>while true; do echo &quot;1&quot; &gt; value; sleep 1; echo &quot;0&quot; &gt; value; sleep 1; done</code></pre></div><p>that GPIO will switch high/low at 0,5 Hz. Maybe you need to adjust the values behind sleep, but 1 second is probably a good start.</p>									</div>

					<p>I thought about it. To safely use a frequency where only one probe. The problem is that the router is powered pulsed voltage source. Or Power source or source GND or any other source of always give ~7KHz. This accuracy I do not have to tell the difference.<br />I used industrial multimeter.<br />Sorry for my English.</p>									</div>

					<p>I can not really follow you. If those GPIOs 13-17 are connected to those LEDs, then you should be able to export them to sysfs and access the appropriate gpioXX/value file (as long as no other driver is occupying them, like some ledtrig-netdev alike driver - do &quot;lsmod | grep led&quot; to find out). And as long as you haven&#039;t confirmed those GPIOs I don&#039;t see any reason for adding them to the mach-tl-mr3x20.c file.</p>									</div>

					<p>Once again, please help me with compiling the data described above.<br />Updated schematic chart that you have no doubts.<br />Pin AR7240 and AR7241 CPU is the same, illustrative example above.<br />The system uses the LED1-4, WAN, and does not use them to take control, so you need to patch the file <strong>mach-tl-mr3x20.c</strong><br />From you I am not asking to flash your router, I just need to compile, I&#039;m at your own risk and will flash my MR-3220 router.<br />Thank you for your patience.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Dioptimizer</strong> on 4 Feb 2012, 12:00)</p>

					<p>Since you have not yet found the assignments of all GPIOs, you should connect to a terminal (telnet or ssh) of your router and issue the following:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cd /sys/class/gpio/

cd gpio13/
echo out &gt; direction

					<p>Actually, I don&#039;t really know about your skills. So, if in doubt, I prefer to give even too much information, than too less. But I certainly don&#039;t compile firmware images for other people, I just try to guide the way as good as I can. And if you want me to stay off your thread, that&#039;s fair enough.<br />Anyway, back to your topic: You should provide more information on what you actually did and tried, and which results you encountered (at best console logs).</p>									</div>
