					<p>Is it a serial cable? Do you have any info? Also, presumably the chip is in the lightning plug, so you would have to really carefully dismantle it to gain access to the wires (or sacrifice a socket from your iDevice!)</p><p>EDIT: so I did a quick google. Sure enough, the business end is in the lightning plug. And it is tiny and complex. And there is no analysis of what exactly it does in terms of data. I wouldn&#039;t bother.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>robthebrew</strong> on 28 Feb 2013, 15:34)</p>

					<p>Honestly, I wouldn&#039;t know much about this cable. However, I thought a USB sync cable is suppose to sync two devices attached to each end. This means data from either ends can migrate from one device to the other. As such, it can be made into a serial-console cable, can&#039;t it? I suppose all the iPhone products use a +3.3VDC on its serial data pins.</p>									</div>

					<p>There is no guessing on the voltage: it could be anything. Easiest would be 5v, but Apple don&#039;t do easy. As to device-device comms: there are so many it isn&#039;t worth listing them. <br />Also, the Lightning connector has a device check chip in it, just to make sure Apple gets the royalties.<br />No, in balance, just get a Nokia cable.</p>									</div>
