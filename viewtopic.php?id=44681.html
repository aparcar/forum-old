					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to stream HD movies from openwrt router using miniDLNA to my laptop. My test environment has a 320GB Seagate external HDD, a BDRIP 1080p movie. The movie&#039;s length is around 2 hours, with size of around 2GB, (bitrare ~2,2Mbps, which is not too high).<br /></p><ul><li><p>1st test: Use a Buffalo WZR-HP-G450H which has 400MHz CPU, 64MB RAM (not quite low, I think). Result: router&#039;s CPU usage is always at 95-100%, with &quot;IO&quot; around 70%.</p></li><li><p>2nd test: Use a Buffalo WZR-HP-AG300H which has 680MHz CPU, 128MB RAM. Result: CPU usage is only less than 10%, &quot;IO&quot;: 0-3%</p></li><li><p>3rd test: WZR-HP-AG300H, with a 60MB file in /tmp, swapiness = 60 (default value, as some pages say, that will make files in /tmp less-likely swapped) --&gt; same result as 1st test: 95-100% CPU, with &quot;IO&quot; around 70%.</p></li></ul><p>The HDD usage is mounted &quot;rw,sync&quot;. There&#039;s a dedicated partition for swap (which I think there&#039;s not much relevant to this test).</p><p>Those 3 test cases above shown that miniDLNA needs a lot of RAM. But, <strong>is that too much?</strong> Is there any problem with my test? People in some old threads in this forum mentioned running miniDLNA on even lower configuration routers, and streamed HD movies with higher bit-rate.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

I don&#039;t know how optimized the USB drivers for the embedded systems are, but there is really no easy way to decrease the CPU usage for doing IO. Running at 100% CPU shouldn&#039;t cause any harm if the router is well designed, and you won&#039;t stream movies 24/7 anyway.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>Averell wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Also, I wonder why many people still suggest to have swap (there are many pages suggesting this in this site).</p></blockquote></div><p>I just can&#039;t figure out which service would benefit from swap.

Might be that EXT3 without journal is EXT2 with large file size (&gt; 4GB) support.<br />I (blindly) followed the wiki page: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/usb.storage">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/usb.storage</a></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>If you are planning on sharing your USB storage with Samba, and/or using it to share large multimedia content over UPnP, e.g. with ushare, you should use ext3 or ext4 rather than ext2. Default Ext2 partitions will be limited to files of no more than 4 Gb, but this restriction is eliminated with the newer filesystems. To retain good performance with the newer filesystems, particularly on flash USB storage, you should also consider disabling journaling with the &quot;-O ^has_journal&quot; when using mkfs.ext4 to format the filesystem. Also for ext4, the &quot;extent&quot; formatting option (e.g. &quot;-O ^has_journal,extent&quot;) will make filesystem access to large files more performant.</p></blockquote></div>									</div>
