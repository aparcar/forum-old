					<p>Used them to format my SD with EXT3, no troubles at all.<br />I&#039;m now using 0.9 but used RC6 packages for a while to make SD work, no trouble with that package (of course recompile it&#039;s better..)</p><p>Ben</p>									</div>

					<p>It seems that packporting e2fsprogs and util-linux packages from trunk is broken. You can try it by yourself.</p><p>I would recommend you to use them from the RC6 backports. They should work. The other option is switching to Kamikaze.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks a lot for you answers. I installed e2fsprogs from rc6 backports. Don&#039;t see any problems for the moment. I install it to use e2fsck to check filesystem on my flash drive. I had some concern about the consistency of the filesystem.<br />I find in wiki remark that e2fsck can be configured to run during loading of the router. But I don&#039;t found any examples how to do it. <br />Can someone , please, share configuration for allowing this? and may be someone can give an idea is it good practice to do it or it&#039;s not really necessary on OpenWRT?<br />Thanks in advance</p>									</div>
