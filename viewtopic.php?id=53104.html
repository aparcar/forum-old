					<p>I have a Netgear WNDR4300 that I want to use as a *wired only* router in a garage. I do not need wifi or want wifi ever to turn on. I&#039;m worried that the router might reset to defaults and come up with wifi on with no password hence allowing anyone access to my LAN.</p><p>Is it possible to neuter the wifi for good by removing the wireless drivers? If yes, how?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenWrt always defaults to disabled wireless, only way to enable by default is if you include your own /etc/config/wireless with enabled wireless in your image, or otherwise include scripts that enable it on boot.</p><p>You can&#039;t delete the drivers from a device with OpenWrt installed, because SquashFS is a read-only filesystem. If you delete a file there will only be a marker in the overlay indicating that this file is inaccessible. However, if the device is booted in failsafe or otherwise booted without mounting the overlay, the drivers will be there.</p><p>If you really want a device with no wireless drivers available, you will have to use the Imagebuilder or compile from source, and build an image without the kernel modules needed for your wireless chip. You will probably also need to modify your platform and/or target profile, because wireless drivers are included by default, as you can see in e.g. <a href="http://git.openwrt.org/?p=openwrt.git;a=blob;f=target/linux/ar71xx/Makefile;h=1b400745d1b5c4bc777e3342ebccb3a687154267;hb=HEAD">target/linux/ar71xx/Makefile</a> (kmod-ath9k is used by many ar71xx devices).</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for clarifying. Is OpenWRT a good choice for my use case? I want firmware that&#039;s very simple in terms of default services, just gateway mode, NAT and SPI firewall, no other services needed. This will be the main router sitting in the garage and there will be another AP on the LAN behind this router, in the middle of the house, for wifi. I don&#039;t really need any services running on the router, not even DNS or DHCP servers (these will be provided by a Linux machine on the LAN). The router currently runs DD-WRT, but it has too much stuff that needs to be disabled, I&#039;d feel better if there were less attack vectors.</p><p>Well, the router will need a DDNS client so that I can get to my home LAN when on the road. And a DHCP *client* to get the WAN IP from the ISP.</p><p>In terms of a web GUI for OpenWRT, what should I use? I&#039;m thinking something to help me configure the router initially but then turn it off via ssh and only enable it if I need to make changes. Or perhaps cmd line is good enough for a simple setup.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, all those could be done with OpenWrt. You can even configure the OpenWrt router as an dumb AP were only the main router is doing the routing part.</p><p>You can create custom OpenWrt images for your router using the Image Builder to remove packages and include others..just as you like.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>written_direcon</strong> on 4 Oct 2014, 19:49)</p>
