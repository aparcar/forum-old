					<p>I am not quite sure what you are asking for:<br />Somebody to port an already existing headless version with web interface to Openwrt?<br />Or somebody to create that headless version first? (I haven&#039;t even checked but I guess that some of the dependency packages have not even been ported to Openwrt.)</p><p>Would you like to connect your e-reader physically to your router&#039;s USB port?

					<p>I investigated this a bit further, after which I deleted my original answer with too hasty conclusions :-(</p><p>Calibre has a well-functioning built-in &quot;content server&quot; web interface, which seems to work ok when browsed from my Kindle. </p><p>So, the main challenge seems to be porting Calibre&#039;s Linux version for Openwrt. Otherwise it might be rather simple, but about half of the packages mentioned on that dependency list are not available in Openwrt. E.g. Calibre GUI is built on Qt, which is not available for Openwrt. However, most of the &quot;missing libraries&quot; are related to GUI, so the server functionality might work without it.</p><p>The best sources I found regarding Calibre&#039;s headless server functionality were:<br /><a href="http://linuxphilia.blogspot.fi/2012/06/my-wife-and-i-like-to-read-books-on-go.html">http://linuxphilia.blogspot.fi/2012/06/ … on-go.html</a><br /><a href="http://manual.calibre-ebook.com/faq.html#how-do-i-run-parts-of-app-like-news-download-and-the-content-server-on-my-own-linux-server">http://manual.calibre-ebook.com/faq.htm … nux-server</a><br /><a href="http://linuxserver2011.wordpress.com/2011/03/26/calibre-ebook-server-setup-ubuntu-10-10/">http://linuxserver2011.wordpress.com/20 … ntu-10-10/</a></p><p>Those make me think that it might be possible to at least test Calibre&#039;s content server parts with a smaller set of libraries.</p><p>EDIT: Additionally, as most routers are not x86 based, the only installation option is from sources and then cross-compiling, which significantly increases the difficulty of the task due to the missing libraries.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 13 Sep 2012, 17:43)</p>

					<p>but still would be nice to use the content server, managed by WebInterface from PC, </p><p>and connected with some free Smartphone Apps (Cool Reader, GPLv3) to use the books from the Calibre Content server. </p><p>striping out the qt libraries and cross compile only the content-server and web interface parts....</p>									</div>

					<p>This would be really a very interesting combination (OpenWrt + calibre). I thought however about other gain - to fetch the news, convert them and send them to the kindle. This could be managed by the command </p><p>ebook-convert /opt/calibre/resources/recipes/foo.recipe bar.mobi,</p><p>triggered by Cronjob.&nbsp; Within calibre you get lots of so called recipes - the ready code snippets written in python to download websites and extract relevant news (like rss, articles from newspapers, blogs postings, weather etc.) </p><p>Colinus</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Colinus</strong> on 9 Nov 2012, 14:39)</p>

					<p>Yeah, if this were possible, it would be great. Sadly Calibre is fairly monolithic :-(.</p>									</div>
