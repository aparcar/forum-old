					<p>This is more of a feature request check, hopefully in the right forum<br />Is there a way to install a package which notifies me via email if a device which should be always online, is offline after some defined time?<br />It would help me by not installing a distro on a pc and/or avoiding finding android apps</p>									</div>

					<p>if it is trivial, then I would complicate it a bit<br />I want to have a list of wi-fi devices, around 20, written in a file<br />the script should check every e.g. 20 seconds (via e.g. ping) if device is offline.<br />if a particular device is offline after given time (e.g. 8 hours, so after 3*60*8 failed attempts ) then send an email with device name<br />the condition with the email sending must be restarted only after 1st successful re-connection (e.g. via ping) </p><p>If anyone can implement/run/test such a script it would help me a lot<br />Any chance of requesting this feature somewhere?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>purdelcristian1983</strong> on 7 Apr 2018, 09:52)</p>
