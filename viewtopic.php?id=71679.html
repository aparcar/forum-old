					<p>hello, tried using the search function on here though was not able to pull up any results for some odd reason. keeps saying to check back in 5-10mins.. <br />any how id like to use a 2nd router behind my main router . Main router does not have wifi nor the option for DMZ and is not an open wrt router, the 2nd router (OpenWrt firmware) has wifi capabilities</p><p>- id like to use that 2nd router as my wifi point. now im not 100% sure on what this exactly this is called: is it &quot;access point ,Bridge AP&quot; maybe you guys can clarify by what i mentioned above.</p><p>- now the MAIN router which is right after the modem, has an ip of 192.168.55.1 (don&#039;t ask why lol)<br />what exactly do i need to do in LUCI to make the 2nd router a wifi point only (i believe some say dumb access point or something along those lines) </p><p>- this is what i just did and made it work, i plugged a cable from an open port on main router(e.g. lan port 1)&nbsp; into the WAN of the 2nd router. then set up a wifi ssid and password and left dhcp on which allows my wireless devices to gain access to the internet through Wifi via 2nd router. <em>NOTE: when i didn&#039;t leave dhcp on i ran into issues as mentioned below.</em></p><p>- now this is wrong because they have the ip&#039;s assigned by 2nd router (e.g. 192.168.1.7) when I want the 1st router&#039;s DHCP to handle and assign ip&#039;s (ex 192.168.55.7) though when i disable dhcp on 2nd router(the OpenWrt router)&nbsp; my wireless devices have a wifi signal though say &quot;no internet connection&quot;. Also i disabled firewall but when i did this i could not access the router at all so i factory reset the 2nd router and left firewall on (which would mean double nat for the wireless devices i suppose) <br />So i am indeed doing something wrong here. <br />hopefully you guys can lend some insight.</p><p>kind regards.</p><p>EDIT: failed to mention i want to avoid Command line to do this, so if any insight is offered pls be it through LuCI GUI. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>meneedlowping</strong> on 31 Jul 2017, 05:25)</p>

					<p>1 - openwrt router<br />2 - yes<br />3 - just follow the instructions.&nbsp; The WAN basically becomes irrelevant as there is nothing connected to it.</p>									</div>
