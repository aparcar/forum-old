					<p>If I&#039;m understanding what you want to do, then starting from a default config, just set the br_lan interface to be a dhcp client.

					<p>Thanks for the comments so far.</p><p>Since I tried various settings, at some point I was not sure anymore, which setting was still at default or not. At the same time I wanted to start using Chaos Calmer (instead of Attitude Adjustment) so I decided to start over again and provide a &quot;roadmap&quot; of steps and changes for others to follow / understand what I have been doing and for myself as a &quot;recipe&quot;. See below.</p><p>But first let&#039;s describe setup and goals<br />Physical setup:<br />A non-OpenWrt router is connected to the internet and some wired_devices over ethernet as well as the OpenWrt WR703n router.

					<p>The general answer to your problem is no.&nbsp; Now if you can code....</p><p>Lets try an experiment.&nbsp; Your primary router is 192.168.178.1 and the AP is 192.168.178.2.&nbsp; Now lets set the DHCP range of your primary router to 192.168.178.100-149 and the OpenWRT router&nbsp; 192.168.178.150-199 =&gt; basically 2 non-overlaping DHCP ranges (to avoid collisions).&nbsp; Of course you need to uncheck the &quot;Ignore Interface&quot; setting to get to those fields.&nbsp; Also note that OpenWRT is not a range but a start value and quantity, so 50 goes to 149 if starting from 100.</p>									</div>

You also want all your WIFi devices (served by your OpenWRT router) to be able to access all devices attached (wired and/or wireless) to your main router and/or vice versa.</p><p>Right now, I am testing a PogoPlug Pro (physically connected to my main cablemodem with a built-in 4-port switch + WiFi) with my own built firmware from git trunk. I also have a Seagate GoFLEX Home physically connected to the same cablemodem. Using the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds">link</a> I mentioned in my previous post, I just modified the /etc/config/wireless file to include <em>option wds 1</em> and it will be able to obtain both IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses from my cablemodem through a physical connection. My&nbsp; Android smartphones, configured to my PogoPlug Pro through WiFi, have no problem to obtain both their IPv4 (private) and IPv6 (public) Addresses from my router. From my Android smartphone, I can access my <a href="http://freeswitch.org">FreeSWITCH</a> on a Seagate GoFLEX Home attached to my main router to place/receive calls. Best of all, if I move out of the WiFi range provided by my PogoPlug Pro and become near to the WiFi range provided by my main router, my Android smartphone hops to connect to my main router. When this happens while I am on a call through my <a href="http://freeswitch.org">FreeSWITCH</a>, all I hear is a void in approximately 1/2 a second.</p>									</div>
