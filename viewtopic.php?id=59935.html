					<p>Hello,</p><p>Occasionally, after a reboot, my wired PC would get a public IP address from my provider instead of a DHCP address from the pool I configured on OpenWrt. </p><p>Usually rebooting after this issue has occurred fixes the issue and brings everything back to normal.</p><p>When this issue happens i can&#039;t access my openwrt router at all but i can perfectly browse the internet it feels like the openwrt router has just become a transparent bridge between my pc and the service provider. </p><p>Trying to release/renew my lease on the client has no effect as i am still getting an address from the provider.</p><p>It also looks to me like the issue doesn&#039;t happens when i reboot from the web gui, only when i use the reboot command from an ssh session, but that might be a red herring </p><p>Setup:<br />SW: BARRIER BREAKER (14.07, r42625)<br />HW: TP-LINK TL-WDR4300 Ver1.7</p>									</div>
