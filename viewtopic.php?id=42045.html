					<p>I&#039;m no longer selling Bifferboards, and there isn&#039;t much activity on the Bifferboard group so I thought I should post here as well.</p><p>There are a few developments that may be of interest to owners of other RDC-based devices, possibly Sitecom routers based on RDC3210 or NAS dongles.</p><p>1) I&#039;ve released a version of the Python JTAG software for the Bifferboard.&nbsp; This was reverse-engineered from the RDC Loader tool, and allows you to flash RDC devices, and to send x86 instructions to the CPU and execute them.&nbsp; It allows you to dump flash as well.&nbsp; You need a parallel port JTAG cable to use it.&nbsp; See: <a href="https://github.com/bifferos/bb/tree/master/tools/jtag">https://github.com/bifferos/bb/tree/master/tools/jtag</a></p><p>2) The Bootloader from the Bifferboard (Biffboot) is still closed source but now available under a fairly permissive license, which includes provision for commercial use.&nbsp; The latest version runs under Qemu as well as all versions of the Bifferboard - 1, 4 and 8MB.&nbsp; I can look at porting it to other RDC devices if there is sufficient interest.&nbsp; It should be fairly easy.&nbsp; The bootloader can be found here: <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/bifferboard/biffboot-community-editions">https://sites.google.com/site/bifferboa … y-editions</a></p><p>3) There is now a debrick utility for Bifferboards, which allows you to recover a bricked board without a parallel port JTAG cable.&nbsp; Unfortunately you will need a second Bifferboard to use it, instructions are here:&nbsp; <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/bifferboard/Home/bootloader/debrick">https://sites.google.com/site/bifferboa … er/debrick</a>&nbsp; There is also work on an Arduino-based version of the JTAG software, but it&#039;s only partially working: <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/bifferboard/browse_thread/thread/58603b2bf53a4a50.">http://groups.google.com/group/bifferbo … bf53a4a50.</a></p><p>regards,<br />Biff.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bifferos</strong> on 1 Feb 2013, 00:26)</p>
