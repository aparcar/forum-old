					<p>Hi,</p><p>I own a WAP54G v1 (MDG0047) with a AM29LV320DB flash chip, reset button is right to the antenna and wireless chip on a mini-pci daughter card.<br />After too much play with it and various firmwares, i bricked it completely (CFE is dead) but hopefully i made a wholeflash backup when it was fine. I used the latest HairyDairy ejtag tool whith the /nobreak option. I don&#039;t know if it is supposed to work well with WAP APs without any patch, backups never hanged but i wasn&#039;t able to start the erase of the kernel without the /nobreak option.</p><p>Now, i can&#039;t flash the backup back to the router, a flash:cfe stops at &quot;4% bytes = 12224&quot; and a flash:wholeflash stops at &quot;0%&nbsp; &nbsp;bytes = 10728&quot;.<br />There is another post related to this problem on a v2 or v3.</p><p>So my questions are :<br />- Why does it stops, is the flash chip dead or the jtag tool incompatible ? <br />- Are there special instructions for a WAP54g ? (can&#039;t find anything)<br />- Does anyone have a CFE backup from a WAP54g v1 or v1.1 ??</p><p>Thank you so much</p>									</div>
