					<p>Hi All, I&#039;ve done a bit of searching/reading on this but not found a lot of conclusive info. I would like to use one of my OpenWRT devices to log network traffic to the internet, log what internal IPs visit what web sites and track bandwidth used by internal IP.</p><p>Obviously, all the traffic needs to be going through the OpenWRT device so i was planning on putting it between my gigabit switch and my adsl router and then switching the wifi off on my router and using the wifi on the OpenWRT box.</p><p>Is it good enough for the OpenWRT box to bridge LAN/WAN/wifi so my adsl router can carry on doing the DHCP and i dont have to mess about with 2 lots of firewall rules for open ports? Ideally id like to be able to add/remove the monitoring device with the minimum of fuss and reconfiguration. If it will work bridged it would just be a case of turning the wifi off on my adsl router and adding the OpenWRT box in line with the switch.</p><p>How should i go about setting up the software side of things? I&#039;ve seen a&nbsp; few names mentioned but not tested anything out as yet and ive not quite decided what device to use for OpenWRT. I&#039;ve got a TP-Link MR3220 and a D-Link DIR-615 kicking about at the moment.</p><p>Any help and advice would be great!</p>									</div>
