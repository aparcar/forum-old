					<p>hi,<br />my apartment complex has installed wifi troughout the residence and is charging everyone for it, therefore I would like to use it and cancel my current ISP.<br />My current setup is as follows:</p><p>www (modem) --&gt;-- IPCOP --&gt;-- LAN</p><p>and I would like to change it to:</p><p>www (wifi) --&gt;-- wireless router (WRT54GL) --&gt;-- IPCOP --&gt;-- LAN</p><p>the problem is that the wifi provided is not secured in any way and you need to authenticate yourself with a username and pass using your browser to get internet access.<br />How could I set that up in the router so that I don&#039;t have to authenticate myself each time?</p>									</div>

					<p>Sounds like the complex uses some form of &quot;captive portal&quot; software.</p><p>Many of these will support automated login via RADIUS.&nbsp; Example chillispot can authenticate by MAC address for select users.&nbsp; Recommend you ask about that before engaging in development work.</p>									</div>

					<p>thanks for the reply.<br />after searching a bit, this seems like much more time than I currently have to put into it<br />so I think I&#039;ll just stick with my ISP for now and not use the wifi<br />thanks again</p>									</div>
