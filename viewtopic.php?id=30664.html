					<p>Hi,<br />I&#039;m starting to use your build chain for my router (wzr hp g300, ar71xx) with good results. </p><p>I am considering purchasing a Palm PRE 2 phone with an OMAP3630 chip, and notice that you support the omap35xx series.</p><p>So my question is, would software built using your build tools run on the Palm PRE 2? </p><p>After a lot of searching, I found <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=11080886&amp;postcount=6">this posting</a> that says, in part:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>The thing to understand is that all the OMAP 3 serires share the same software register interface. the part numbering is based on generation and intended market:<br />OMAP34xx: High Volume ODM 65nm<br />OMAP35xx: Embedded Low volume customers (same features as OMAP34xx)<br />OMAP36xx: High Volume ODM 45nm (Higher clock speed, SGX double clock speed)<br />AM37xx and DM 37xx: Embedded low volume customers (same features as OMAP36xx)</p><p>if you look at the release. this is intended for non ODM customers and enthousiasts access to the SDK they provide to their high volume customer. this is why the OMAP 34and 36 are not mentioned. TI provides them different SDK. the important part is that this provides a stable hardware accelerated kernel with drivers to the comunity.</p></blockquote></div><p>I see where he says &quot;TI provides a different SDK&quot; for the 36xx, but thought I&#039;d ask here to confirm. Also, [url=]this page[/url] says the phone&#039;s webOS 2.0.1 uses linuxkernel-2.6.24, and <a href="http://opensource.palm.com/2.1.2/index.html">this page</a> says webOS v2.1.2 uses linuxkernel-2.6.29. </p><p>If possible, it would be exceedingly cool to use a single build environment for both router and phone.<br />Thanks,</p>									</div>

					<p>mazlow: are you just kidding, or are you telling me to take a hike?</p><p>Of course not to run OpenWRT, but to have access to the many fine compiled apps, being able to install them using opkg, and to build other stuff that needs building. Thought that would be clear. </p><p>Question still is, will apps (other than OpenWRT) built for omap35xx (using the OpenWRT buidl chain) run on the omap3630 chip running Linux kernel 2.6?</p>									</div>

As I said before, I sure would like to see this happens. Once this works, I may want to get a unit of PALM PRE-2 unit to flash it with OpenWRT.</p>									</div>

					<p>mazilo: then let me apologize for misunderstanding. I&#039;ve been reading a lot of tech forums lately where newcomers are mocked or ignored--just kinda tired of it :-/ If it&#039;s different here, that would be a nice change. </p><p>Bought a Pre 2 on eBay tonight. Guess I&#039;ll just have to wait to see if it&#039;ll run bits for the omap35xx. Looking forward to running node.js on a phone :) In the mean time, I&#039;ll try building node for the g300. Anyone already have a package for this?<br />Thanks,</p>									</div>
