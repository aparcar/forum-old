					<p>Hello OpenWRT Community,</p><p>I&#039;ve got quite a weird problem. I have a TP Link WR841N v.9.2 Router which can connect to the Internet with its original Firmware without any problems. I just put in the MAC Adress I gave to my provider and it immeadiatlyy works perfectly.<br />So far so good: But I want to use a VPN Service and I dont want to always start the Software on my Desktop and I also want my Smarthphones and my other Devices to benefit from the VPN Connection, so I decided to Upgrade to OpenWRT.<br />Problem here is not with the VPN Integration but much weirder. <br />I installed the newest supported OpenWRT for my router and configured the MAC Override for the WAN interface but: No Internet.</p><p>Well actually thats not true: I have Internet for like 2 seconds after connecting the interface. <br />Enough time to load up google but then the connection dies. But the weirdest thing is this: My PC still says it has Internet Connection on the little symbol right next to the clock in Windows 8. But I can guarantee that I don&#039;t get any connection at my PC.</p><p>This is so confusing to me, why does the original Firmware work and deliver Internet with no problem, and OpenWRT has such an unusual bug?</p><p>I hope you can help me,<br />Sincerly <br />Nyard</p>									</div>

					<p>SSH in to the router and do &#039;ifconfig&#039; to see the MAC that is actually used.&nbsp; It may also be using the factory MAC at first then switching and the provider doesn&#039;t like that.</p><p>If this is the router that you will be using (either stock or OpenWRT firmware shouldn&#039;t matter) you should tell the provider to allow its factory MAC.</p>									</div>
