					<p>I would say : start with a default image, try the packages for the services you want [report bugs or suggestions] and choose those that fit your needs best. If you feel brave, you can even report your own experience in the Wiki with pros and cons for each package you tried and the guide you were looking for will automagically be written.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK- that&#039;s a fair response.&nbsp; And you&#039;ve helped me out enough times that I&#039;ll be glad to help out this way.&nbsp; But can you give me a couple hints?&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to decide if I should forward ports using the xinetd superserver, or if I should forward them using the QoS setup that actually forwards ports.</p><p>I could try it both ways, but I&#039;m going to have trouble generating enough traffic from outside to figure which way is more efficient.</p>									</div>

					<p>I wonder why this is a package question?</p><p>Ordinary port-forwarding is normally done using the included iptables commands, not xinetd or QoS functions. Unless by &quot;forward ports&quot; you mean something else than DNAT.</p>									</div>

					<p>Maybe I&#039;m misunderstanding.&nbsp; *shrug*</p><p>I thought that both of these packages provided user-friendly techniques for forwarding services through an OpenWrt firewall.&nbsp; I assume that the QoS setup will use iptables commands to implement port-forwarding.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t assume that xinetd will.</p><p>I would suppose that xinetd will process packets and therefore take more CPU time.&nbsp; But my understanding is that any QoS setup will neessarily cost a certain amount of bandwidth.&nbsp; I was hoping to get some idea of the tradeoffs for these two techniques for port-forwarding.</p><p>Sure- I could just use iptables commands myself.&nbsp; But I know I&#039;m not the only one on this board who believes that hand-editing those commands is tedius and somewhat error-prone.</p><p>But it certainly started out as a package question, about conflicts between multiple packages that provide similar services.&nbsp; If you want the history, based in CentOS, I&#039;ll be happy to supply it.&nbsp; Maybe offline?</p>									</div>

					<p>If you are deathly afraid of the command-line, then OpenWRT is probably not the best distribution to use.&nbsp; I&#039;m not trying to be snippy here, nor am I an expert, but the FAQ is one clear indicator. See item 2.2:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/Faq#head-62ba2f578dcd777e208fecabd0851e58c72245ef">http://wiki.openwrt.org/Faq#head-62ba2f â€¦ 58c72245ef</a></p><p>Is there an effort to add some web-interface stuff? Yes.&nbsp; Should it supplant the CLI? IMHO, no.</p><p>I am not an expert, but if you want a lot of point-and-clickiness, then many other firmware do that already.</p><br /><p>The nature of OpenWRT includes a lot of user-contributed packages. By the nature of this process there will be some overlap, duplication of effort, old packages versus new ones, etc.&nbsp; There is less of a single-person deciding &quot;this is the One True Way, we will not offer other packages that perform this function.&quot;&nbsp; I see this as a choice that allows much freedom. The whole thought-process behind making GUI your god, means you boil things down to as few choices as possible.&nbsp; For example OpenVPN.&nbsp; Another firmware project thinks it&#039;s too complicated to have &quot;server&quot; setup screens so they cripple the OpenVPN implementation to client mode only.&nbsp; With OpenWRT you can run OpenVPN with whatever configuration file you like and it is fully functional.&nbsp; You can use dnsmasq, or you can use some other package to perform DHCP functions.&nbsp; Other firmware often pick their &quot;right&quot; package and leave you out in the cold if you want other choices.&nbsp; If you have PPTP, why do you need OpenVPN, IPSec, or other choices?&nbsp; I suppose if I were a masochist I could run all 3 at one time with OpenWRT.&nbsp; Look at Nico&#039;s testing directory, quite a lot of stuff in there eh?&nbsp; Not everyone uses it though. The basic package set seen with RC4 is relatively better. It could use better documentation to be sure,&nbsp; some well-written contributions would be welcome.&nbsp; Jump in!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 14 Mar 2006, 19:46)</p>

					<p>Good gracious, no!</p><p>Look, you&#039;re jumping to a lot of conclusions without asking many questions.&nbsp; When did I say ANYTHING about wanting to use a web interface?</p><p>It so happens I do most of my work with CLI.&nbsp; But I know that mistakes are more likely to be made editing seldom-changed cryptic iptables commands than when editing seldom-changed human-readable forwarding lines.</p><p>I am NOT going to feel guilty about using either xinetd or QoS just for that purpose.&nbsp; ESPECIALLY if the only penalty is a small amount of space in squashfs.&nbsp; Why do things the hard way?</p><p>Eliminate complexity where you can- it leaves you more time to concentrate on the things that can&#039;t be simplified.</p>									</div>

OpenVPN, IPSec, and PPTP are different things doing similar jobs. They operate on different ports generally speaking. If you were smart enough to handle the networking, you could run all 3 at once. The hardware would probably melt&nbsp; if you put load on all 3 at once but that&#039;s a different problem. A few are valid I think, dropbear vs OpenSSH server for example. Although, dropbear is just a lightweight SSH server. So if your needs exceeded what it can do, I would probably just load OpenSSH server and disable dropbear not run both at once. Although you certainly could, just run them on different ports.</p><p>A table of &quot;common functions&quot; with links to &quot;best ways to do that&quot; would be useful.&nbsp; I&#039;d be willing to lend a few edits if you start one.&nbsp; See, we agree that the elephant is in the room, we just have to agree what to do about it. I agree that better documentation would be helpful.</p><p>&quot;We need to make things as simple as possible, and no simpler.&quot; -A.
