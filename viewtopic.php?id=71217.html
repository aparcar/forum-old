					<p>Dear OpenWrt Community,</p><p>We have a project that&#039;s using a Raspberry-Pi3 configured as a router, but we&#039;re interested to switch to dedicated routing hardware running OpenWrt ... if only there is an available router that has enough disk space after flashing.&nbsp; </p><p>We need to run a Django website and some Python3 daemons to control iptables.&nbsp; Could anyone suggest a product that would work?</p><p>The project has kids earn their internet access by completing activities.&nbsp; It&#039;s a great way to supplement their educations.&nbsp; OpenWrt forum won&#039;t let me post a link, but you are invited to join our google discussion group named &quot;NetDispenser&quot;.</p><p>Thank you,<br />Charles</p>									</div>

					<p>One&nbsp; goal is always to keep cost down, so &quot;low as possible&quot;.&nbsp; I&#039;d say $100 max, or more if good reason.&nbsp; I tried this several years ago with a Linksys 54GL (or S?).&nbsp; That&#039;s what I know doesn&#039;t have enough space to run the extra stuff I want to run.&nbsp; But such a device as that, but with more space, would be ideal.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to avoid daisy-chaining the Pi off the main router by moving the whole credit-meter implementation up onto a proper, front-facing router.&nbsp; Old re-purposed hardware would be an attractive option, consistent with the DIY context of the project.&nbsp; It also seems like there are router manufacturers in Taiwan, iirc, who sell base units upon which you can add from a menu of options ... does that sound familiar?<br />Thanks!<br />Charles</p>									</div>
