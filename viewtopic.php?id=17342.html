					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve ran into a problem. I would like to change some files in the linux kernel for my target. In this case, it is an Atmel AVR32 development board named atngw100.</p><p>What I did, is adding a file target/linux/avr32/files-2.6.25/arch/avr32/boards/atngw100/setup.c that is changed to my needs. I prefer this over a patch in this phase of development.</p><p>The problem is that during build, this file is copied to the build_dir before the patches target/linux/avr32/patches/* are applied. One of these patches also modifies that setup.c. Obviously, because of my changes, that patch fails, breaking the build.</p><p>Now I&#039;m wondering whether the patches shouldn&#039;t be applied _before_ the target/*/files* are copied. In my view, that would be more logical because the files there should overwrite what is already in OpenWRT. Actually, I made my modifications on top of the patched setup.c file and not the pristine 2.6.25.9 linux source file.</p><p>(side note: tested on OpenWRT trunk, r11629. I guess that this feature hasn&#039;t changed since then)</p><p>As a &quot;quick fix&quot;, I&#039;m considering to change&nbsp; the copy &amp; patch order of Kernel/Patch/Default (see include/quilt.mk). Is that the right way to go?</p><p>Any comments?</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Bas.</p>									</div>

					<p>Here is an example on how it works the way I would like it to work:</p><p>Index: include/quilt.mk<br />===================================================================<br />--- include/quilt.mk&nbsp; &nbsp; (revision 100)<br />+++ include/quilt.mk&nbsp; &nbsp; (working copy)<br />@@ -69,12 +69,12 @@<br /> define Kernel/Patch/Default<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; $(if $(QUILT),rm -rf $(PKG_BUILD_DIR)/patches; mkdir -p $(PKG_BUILD_DIR)/patches)<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; if [ -d $(GENERIC_FILES_DIR) ]; then $(CP) $(GENERIC_FILES_DIR)/* $(LINUX_DIR)/; fi<br />+&nbsp; &nbsp; $(call PatchDir,$(GENERIC_PATCH_DIR),generic/)<br />+&nbsp; &nbsp; $(call PatchDir,$(PATCH_DIR),platform/)<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; if [ -d $(FILES_DIR) ]; then \<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $(CP) $(FILES_DIR)/* $(LINUX_DIR)/; \<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; find $(LINUX_DIR)/ -name \*.rej | xargs rm -f; \<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; fi<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp; $(call PatchDir,$(GENERIC_PATCH_DIR),generic/)<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp; $(call PatchDir,$(PATCH_DIR),platform/)<br /> endef</p><p>So first general files copied, patches applied and then some files that are overwritten. I admit that it is somewhat asymmetric because the order of copying and patching is different in the general and architecture specific files. But if I change the order of the general files&amp;patches, patching fails. So some patches do modify copied files from the generic source that are copied.</p><p>I think one proper way would be to not allow any patch to modify a copied file. Because these files already are version managed. So they should be applied as-is and not be patched again. <br />But the following scheme might work better in the real world of OpenWRT:</p><p>1) Copy general files that should be added<br />2) Apply general patches<br />3) Copy general files that can override others<br />4) Copy arch specific files that should be added<br />5) Apply arch specific patches<br />6) Copy arch specific files thay can override others</p><p>1,2 and part of 5 are OpenWRT controlled. An OpenWRT user (sw developer) can use 4, 5 (by adding patches) and 6 to modify architecture specific kernel stuff. In an ideal world, one would even consider pre and post files and patches, making it 8 different items.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Bas.</p>									</div>
