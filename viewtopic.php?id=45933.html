					<p>Confirmed it works. </p><p>However, now I have a new and improved problem <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />. After flashing it, I opened the router to wire the serial line. After I was done, I verified that I didn&#039;t put solder on the components and measured the resistence between tx/rx and power/ground. TX/Rx are around .6 and power/ground around .9(1 being full resistance). When I powered the router, the blue led stays on and even after I wait and click on the reset button, the led doesn&#039;t blink. It also seems to be a fainter. The router isn&#039;t recognized anymore by Ethernet nor does it provide an access point. Any ideas on what I might have destroyed and if(unlikely but I&#039;m hoping) this is a repairable software problem.</p><p>In short, the router seems dead, it isn&#039;t recognized by lan/ethernet and doesn&#039;t not provide WiFi anymore. The blue led stays on whatever I do. </p><p>Any ideas?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vf2245</strong> on 24 Aug 2013, 23:21)</p>
