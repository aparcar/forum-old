					<p>The Sierra driver in the Linux kernel always seems to be a bit outdated. Sierra offers the latest version on their website.</p><p>Whether or not it works with the 320U is up in the air. I haven&#039;t seen the modem, but thus far all LTE modems (save the LG VL600) can either dial out using PPP, or provide access via an NDIS interface and (unfortunately) proprietary commands. So, you should be fine. Just make sure you don&#039;t overwrite any of the PDP contexts when you ifup. The default OpenWrt scripts cram the APN into CID 1, and for extra points it overwrites the PDP context type with &quot;IP&quot;. Most LTE modems I&#039;ve seen have PDP context types of &quot;IPV4&quot; or &quot;IPV6&quot;.</p>									</div>
