					<p>We&#039;ve seen two major events lately: 12.09rc2 and 12.09 itself have been released with no mentioning in either the news subforum or the project home page.<br />I already tried to shed some light on <strong><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39819">the bad shape of the web site</a></strong>. But this looks really too much to me.<br />Where are you, Mr. Webmaster?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>uqbar</strong> on 16 Apr 2013, 18:51)</p>
