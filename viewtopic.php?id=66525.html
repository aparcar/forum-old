					<p>Article on Arstechnica:<br /><a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/08/fcc-forces-tp-link-to-support-open-source-firmware-on-routers/">http://arstechnica.com/information-tech … n-routers/</a></p><p>As an associated note, TP Link&#039;s stance on this issue (against tinkerers and OpenWRT) will have an effect on sales. To what quantity, I can&#039;t say.</p><p>I recently bought a new router. Historically, I&#039;ve favored TP-Link, but not anymore. I bought a TRENDnet TEW-827DRU and I&#039;m actively working on porting LEDE/OpenWRT to it, which you can read about here: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=65956">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=65956</a></p><p>I should have a working build in the next few days.</p><p>I could have just bought a TP-Link Archer C2600 instead, which has already been ported, but I didn&#039;t want to buy TP-Link anymore.</p><p>That turned out to be a good move for me, because the TP-Link purposefully made tinkering more difficult by removing the serial port level shifter, requiring difficult soldiering and modding if you want to get a console on their router. Meanwhile, the TRENDnet not only has a super-easy-to-access console port, but a JTAG interface and 4x more flash space (granted it&#039;s SLC NAND instead of NOR).</p><p>I hope to make the TRENDnet a prefered option over the TP-Link to OpenWRT buyers.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jmomo</strong> on 2 Aug 2016, 02:42)</p>
