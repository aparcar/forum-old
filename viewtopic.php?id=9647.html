					<p>I&#039;m looking into getting a new router for a paid hotspot solution.&nbsp; (I&#039;m setting up a small hotspot solution for a RV Resort so no more than 100 users would connect to it.)</p><p>Here are some questions?</p><p>Does OpenWrt with chillispot support user billing? Or do I need to use MyPHPPrePaid or something like that? Also if I could find a wireless router that I could upgrade the antenna to a bi-direction antenna and also have a usb port so I can add a 2gb thumb drive for extra storage.</p><p>Any suggestions would be greatful.</p><p>D</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;d prefer a router with <br />- USB ports, without it, it may be you won&#039;t have enough storage in the internal flash to install all required software<br />- an atheros wireless chipset (currently broadcom wireless chipsets require you to use the proprietary broadcom drivers with a 2.4 series kernel)</p><p>The WL-500gP has a broadcom wireless chipset, but since it&#039;s a mini pci card, you could exchange it with an atheros one.</p>									</div>

					<p>What MMCM meant is that you can purchase and replace the mini-pci card inside the router with an Atheros card.<br />There are many available on ebay (and probably elsewhere) as they work in laptops as well.</p>									</div>
