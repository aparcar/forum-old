Easy to fix if you have serial console: Just press a key and type e.g. &quot;run nandboot&quot; to boot the other, working, installation.</p><p>But IMHO it would be much better if sysupgrade somehow could delay changing the bootloader variables until *after* a successful flash.</p></blockquote></div><p>I&#039;ve also modified that to detect the actual boot partition, not the boot partition set in the firmware.
