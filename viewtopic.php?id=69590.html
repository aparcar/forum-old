					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am very new to openwrt, so sorry for asking something trivial, but I could not find the information I need...</p><p>I need a script that stops my router to behave as an access point and connect to another wifi network instead, ideally in a way that would not change any configuration, so when the device reboots it works as an ap again.</p><p>The tool to use is probably &quot;iw&quot; but so far I have not figured out how to change the mode from &quot;master&quot; to &quot;managed&quot;.</p><p>Can someone show me how to do that?</p><p>Many thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p><strong>iw</strong> is utility to just manage wifi devices. You need configure /etc/config/network, and maybe /etc/config/wireless Don&#039;t afraid to modify configs.

					<p>The reason I do not want to change any config is</p><p>a) because I want to know how to do it (ifconfig/iwconfig/iw should be all you need)<br />b) because if I don&#039;t change any config I can simply pull the plug and it reverts to ap should anything go wrong</p><p>What probably is possible is turning off wifi, changing the config and turning it on again plus an init-script that ensures that after a reboot it goes into ap-mode, but that seems to be a very clumsy way to do it.</p><p>Is this really the way to do it?</p><p>What I forsee for my use-cases is that the essid of the network I want to connect to is not even known beforehand, but is found via scanning.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, but firmware is not intended to modify such options &quot;on the fly&quot;. Above there is suggestion of travelmate package, but it just automatically selects wifi network from specified list to connect. You want <strong>to change operation mode of wifi</strong>, it could be implemented only by configuration. You can use uci to perform it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, I admit I use my device in a way that is probably unusual.</p><p>If going down the config-way is the only way to do it, ok, I&#039;ll go down that route.</p><p>I grant you that the firmware is probably &quot;not intended&quot; to do such things on the fly, but that does not mean it is not possible, just that nobody so far seems to know how to do it.</p><p>But the wifi-stack is pretty much the same as on a linux-system, so why should it not be possible?</p><p>I&#039;ll invest a few more hours before I may be forced to throw the towel...</p>									</div>
