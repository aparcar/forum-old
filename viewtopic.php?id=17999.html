					<p>I have installed Kamikazi 7.09 with webif on an NSLU2, accessed from a Vista PC through Putty.&nbsp; I want a limited installation and have everything installed on the flash--PHP5, dropbear, httpd, gmediaserver, and a number of php scripts.&nbsp; The php scripts build web pages which I want to be semi-private.&nbsp; I have their output in the /www directory.&nbsp; </p><p>I want to access the files cross the local lan using another php program running on a Windows PC.&nbsp; I can access them using the PHP command file_get_contents($Geturl), where $Geturl is in the form &quot;http://id:pw@10.0.0.210/filename.xml&quot;--successfully when id=&quot;root&quot; and pw is my root password.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to have this combination in plain text on my PC, so I have tried to create a user and use that password.&nbsp; This is not working for me so far.</p><p>On the NSLU2 I created a user, say &quot;joe&quot;.&nbsp; The command, adduser, didn&#039;t work, so I edited /etc/passwd, put in &quot;joe::8000:8000:Joe:/home/joe:/bin/ash&quot;.&nbsp; I ran &quot;passwd joe&quot; and supplied a password.&nbsp; I modified /etc/httpd.conf and put in a line &quot;/filename.xml:joe:joe&#039;s_pw&quot;.&nbsp; Now when I run my PC php program with the id and password changed for joe, I get a &quot;401 Unauthorized&quot; message.&nbsp; With &quot;root&quot; and &quot;rootpw&quot; it works.</p><p>So I went back to the NSLU2 and tried &quot;login joe&quot;--this returns &quot;login failed&quot;.&nbsp; When I just try &quot;login&quot;, it immediately says &quot;login failed&quot; without prompting for the user name.&nbsp; My experience with linux is modest.&nbsp; I may be missing something simple, but how do I log into a non-root user?</p>									</div>
