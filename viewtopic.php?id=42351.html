					<p>in usb storage wiki there is this section:</p><p>Disable writing when not mounted<br />You may create an empty file to indicate that the disk is not plugged in so that you don&#039;t put files directly onto NAND by doing</p><p>touch /mnt/usbstorage/USB_DISK_NOT_PRESENT<br />chmod 444 /mnt/usbstorage -R</p><br /><p>but root can still write to this folder if device is not mounted,right?<br />and if the folder is shared over nfs while device not plugged in and I write to it my&nbsp; NAND will explode, right?<br />so how do you really prevent this from happening? I may plug off the device here and there and if I forget to plug it in before I write to the folder over nfs I may be in problems.<br />maybe use chattr? which does not exist in openwrt.</p><p>Thank you</p>									</div>

					<p>As a noob, I saw this forum post after looking at the wiki...<br />I think it is generally a correct idea.<br />The file USB_DISK_NOT_PRESENT doesn&#039;t do anything really except make the lock visible to people trying to use the directory.<br />The chmod line, on the other hand, does prevent files from being written if the filesystem isn&#039;t mounted.<br />I would likely change it though:<br />touch /mnt/usbstorage/USB_DISK_NOT_PRESENT<br />chmod 500 /mnt/usbstorage -R<br />chmod 400 /mnt/usbstorage/USB_DISK_NOT_PRESENT</p><p>This will not prevent root from doing things.. But why would you be putting files on your USB as root?<br />I think this is mostly for people using FTP, NFS or Samba fileshares.. It is to prevent accidental writing to the system, and will prevent it, provided you aren&#039;t working as root (which you shouldn&#039;t)</p>									</div>
