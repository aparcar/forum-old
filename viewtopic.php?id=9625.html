					<p>I have built a robotic head out of a broken DVD-ROM using the seeking track+motor to open and close my robot&#039;s mouth. <br />I have also ordered some LMD18200T chips to use for my H-bridges. Right now all I&#039;m focusing on is the one motor (eyes and other features to follow next semester). <br />The WGT634U has some GPIO lines labeled TP1-TP5 and accessible in byte form 1234xx5x. (I&#039;m guessing that means 11110010 or 0x152 puts them all high) Do I need a PCF8574 or similar GPIO expander or can I just turn the motor off and on really fast to simulate speech? Or should I just go ahead and get that chip to allow for future functionalities?</p><p>And finally the OpenWRT part: what driver is out there for a basic setup like this? is the stuff shown here: <a href="http://openwrt.pbwiki.com/I2C">http://openwrt.pbwiki.com/I2C</a> the latest and greatest development for accessing GPIO lines on a WGT?</p><p>I&#039;d like to hear of any crazy things y&#039;all have done with this sweet router. I did the wireless mp3 player and I kept on chugging <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Anyone know if chuck still visits the forums? He&#039;s the one who made the I2C driver so he should know this one. Or maybe flyashi can give me some pointers with what he did for his wifi car v2.</p>									</div>

					<p>I skipped the I2C stuff and mangled mbm&#039;s code to give me GPIO access. Not the quickest way to do it, but the robot is done and using flite, sox, my own wonderful C programs, and some &quot;spare parts&quot; ingenuity (with lots of hot glue) I built my robot talking head. Now just to write it up and get an A. Thank you everyone who helped me on this one.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bradkarhu</strong> on 12 Apr 2007, 21:00)</p>
