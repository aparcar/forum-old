					<p>The Client Mode Wireless wiki does not explain how to configure a network containing wireless clients.&nbsp; While it is true that this information may belong somewhere else, I could not find it, and I don&#039;t understand networks well enough to figure it out, so I am asking here.</p><p>In my case, I have a US Robotics wired router (a hub with NAT) connected on its WAN side to a DSL modem and on the LAN side to two PCs and one Belkin F5D8230-4 wireless router (LAN port).&nbsp; All these devices are on the 192.168.123.x subnet, and use a 255.255.255.0 subnet mask.</p><p>I acquired a Linksys WRT54GL and flashed it with the latest official release of Kamikaze.&nbsp; I turned the wireless card on and added a STA-mode interface to /etc/config/wireless.&nbsp; It was not clear if I should remove the existing AP interface or leave it in.&nbsp; In any case my wireless configuration now looks like this:</p><p>-----------<br />config wifi-device&nbsp; wl0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option type&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;broadcom<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option channel&nbsp; 5</p><p>config wifi-iface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option device&nbsp; &nbsp;wl0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option network&nbsp; lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option mode&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ap<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ssid&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;OpenWrt<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option encryption none<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option hidden&nbsp; &nbsp;1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />config wifi-iface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option device&nbsp; &nbsp;wl0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option mode&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sta<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ssid&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;luigi<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option encription wep<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option key&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; asdfasdfasdfasdfasdf # not my real WEP key<br />-----------</p><p>The wireless part seems to work: &quot;iwlist wl0 scan&quot; shows a couple of cells with mode:Master, mine and the neighbor&#039;s.&nbsp; ifconfig shows a wl0 interface (down) and a wl0.1 interface (up).</p><p>But what should I set the IP address of br-lan to? Some blogs/posts/wikis indicate that it should be on a subnet different from the rest of the system.&nbsp; Presumably the PC connected to the wireless client router should be on the same subnet as the router.&nbsp; But how would I then route packets across the two subnets?</p><p>In addition, what bridges the wireless device to the LAN ports?&nbsp; Should these lines</p><p>config interface lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option type&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bridge<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;eth0.0&quot;</p><p>be changed to</p><p>config interface lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option type&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bridge<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;eth0.0 wl0.1&quot;</p><p>But then again, these appear to be already bridged:</p><p>root@bridge:/# brctl show<br />bridge name&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bridge id&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;STP enabled&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;interfaces<br />br-lan&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8000.00212970ded6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;no&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; eth0.0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wl0.1</p><p>What made them so?</p><p>In addition, I just found this old comment (1 year ago) by mbm, one of the developers:</p><p>---------------<br />I&#039;ve said it several times before, but it looks like I need to repeat myself -&nbsp; &nbsp;[MAYBE PUT THIS IN A WIKI EH?]</p><p>Client mode was written on the assumption that a client is a single computer; when communicating with the access point it deals in terms of 3 mac addresses - client, ap, destination. When multiple devices are communicating through the client, the original mac address of the source is lost; everything appears as the client mac address, causing subtle problems with the networking. We already implement several workarounds, but client mode bridges are still problematic.</p><p>Instead, try one of the following -</p><p>1&gt; Don&#039;t attempt to bridge the networks; give the client and all machines connected to the client a new subnet and set up routing between both subnets to make it seamless. The added separation will also reduce your wireless bandwidth.</p><p>2&gt; Wireless Distribution System (WDS). WDS is a point to point link, typically between access points; these point to point connections use a 4 address scheme (adds a source mac address), meaning that WDS links can be used to bridge networks or create wireless repeaters.</p>									</div>
