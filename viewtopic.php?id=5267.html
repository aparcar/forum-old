					<p>I&#039;ve played a little with connecting a VGA monitor to the wrt54g using an FPGA for generating the VGA signal.<br />The basic idea is to transfer the image to be shown to the FPGA using some of the GPIO pins (in the same way the SD card mod works). The FPGA then outputs the image from what it currently has in its buffer.<br /><a href="http://www.duff.dk/wrt54gs/pics/Complete_VGA_Setup.jpg">http://www.duff.dk/wrt54gs/pics/Complete_VGA_Setup.jpg</a> shows that a 320x200 mode in 1 color was possible (we could have had more colors but were limited by the blockram available in the FPGA)</p><p>If you only want to update once every minute I&#039;m sure some solution can be made, but using it as a console that needs to be updated quite often is just too slow.</p>									</div>
