					<p>Hello,</p><p>My openwrt box is configured as a routed client that connects to a upnp access point.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking for a solution to open/close ports on the upnp access point from behind the openwrt router.</p><p>Here&#039;s a quick diagram:</p><p>windows xp -&gt; 192.168.6.0/24 openwrt routed client -&gt; 192.168.1.0/24 upnp access point -&gt; internet</p><p>I&#039;ve tried two solutions (unsuccessfully):<br />1) Setup multicast routing on the openwrt box.&nbsp; This would allow Windows Xp can see the upnp broadcasts from the access point.&nbsp; I have little experience with this, but based on some quick tests with igmpproxy, it appears that the default openwrt image is not compiled with multicast routing support.</p><p>2) Run a upnp client program on the openwrt box.&nbsp; The source code for miniupnp appears to contain both a server and client executable (miniupnpd and miniupnpc respectively).&nbsp; However, the openwrt ipkg only contains the server daemon, so I&#039;m looking for the client program.</p><p>If anyone has any guidance, that would be helpful.&nbsp; Assume that I am unable to connect the XP machine directly to the upnp access point.</p>									</div>

					<p>does your &quot;192.168.6.0/24 openwrt&quot; router do NAT or only route ip between the 2 subnetworks ?<br />In anycase, Windows XP upnp client has issues with this kind of setup : it refuses to take into account any IGD device which is not the default gateway <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>
