					<p>Hi everyone!</p><p>Yesterday, I installed OpenWrt for the first time. I&#039;m amazed about its simplicity. It seems to be the opposite of bloatware and I love it. Great work!</p><p>As I would really like to get into it, instead of just &quot;making it work&quot; I would like to understand what&#039;s going on. So let me ask a few questions which are not exactly OpenWrt specific.</p><p>My home network consists of a few Linux devices (samba server, HTPC...), mobile devices (Android, iOS) and workstations (Windows). Until now, I haven&#039;t really cared about local DNS or DHCP. I&#039;ve setup static IPs and that&#039;s it.</p><p>What I would now like to do is centralize the configuration. I would like to let my new router handle everything. I&#039;ve read through all the documentation I could find about dnsmasq, DHCP etc. and decided to do it like this:<br />* Enable DHCP using static leases<br />* Define every statically defined host a hostname in /etc/hosts</p><p>Now here come the questions:<br />1) From what I understood, another possibility to make local DNS work, would be to let the clients define their hostnames, which are then used by dnsmasq (as long as the clients use DHCP). How does this work under different OSes? Do they all send their hostnames in a compatible way?<br />2) Does the way I described above make sense? Or did I understand something completely wrong?<br />3) If it does and I go this way, what about the hostnames <strong>set on the clients</strong>? Do they exist parallely and can just be set to whatever? Do they have to be the same as on the router? Are the router&#039;s definitions sent to the client and does every OS understand this?</p><p>I&#039;d be glad to get basic input about this, as I can&#039;t really seem to get answers to these questions in existing documents.</p>									</div>

					<p>1) yes the announcement of hostnames via dhcp is compatible across OSes but some do not send it by default, e.g. older Debian and Ubuntu distros needed a config file change to send the hostname<br />2) yes it makes sense, but be aware that dnsmasq will not resolve such DHCP hostnames if the corresponding lease is not active<br />3) client hostnames do not matter, as long as they do not collide</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for the quick and helpful answer!</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>jow wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>2) yes it makes sense, but be aware that dnsmasq will not resolve such DHCP hostnames if the corresponding lease is not active</p></blockquote></div><p>Ok, that&#039;s clear. My question under 2) was aimed at defining all hostnames centrally in the router&#039;s /etc/hosts file, though. Not using the clients&#039; hostnames. I guess I should have been clearer.<br />Does defining them like that make sense? Are there any more downsides to this method, besides possible collisions with client-side hostnames?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>soopersonic</strong> on 15 Apr 2012, 18:55)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m not sure what you mean with &quot;transferred back&quot;. The local hostname (/proc/sys/kernel/hostname on Linux) will not change but the name and ip are resolvable when the clients use the router as dns server; means if you lookup the hostname you&#039;ll get the local ip and when you lookup the ip you&#039;ll get the hostname as defined in /etc/hosts on the router.</p>									</div>

					<p>That&#039;s what I meant! Because this way it might be more interesting for me to set the (local) hostname on the client. Two of them are embedded devices which use that name in other places, like the GUI or as the name for the device in certain protocols (smb for example).</p><p>But I guess I know enough to start trying around. Thanks again!</p>									</div>

					<p>One downside is that when you reboot the router it forget all hostnames until they request&nbsp; a new lease.</p><p>What I found is that often iDevices don’t have a hostname. Apparently there’s a setting somewhere that’s not set by default.</p>									</div>
