					<p>So, because no one answered your question within nine hours of you posting it, we are a bunch of dumb, lazy jerks?<br />Not everyone lives in your timezone; people on these forums live all over the globe.&nbsp; Many of us even have lives outside of the internet so we don&#039;t always get a chance to check the forums.&nbsp; Also, searching for the terms &quot;serial console&quot; on the wiki would have told you all you need about connection to the serial port...</p>									</div>

					<p>NO.. I definitely was NOT referring to my question ONLY.. before posting it I surveyed this forum for past similar questions<br />on the subject and on other issues I&#039;ve had with openwrt. MOST of the ones (some of them were MONTHS OLD) that<br />had something to do with the problems I ran into, were NEVER answered!!!!! THAT is what am referring to.</p><p>right.. so obviously you are not all blind and deaf here.. you seem to only reply when you<br />feel passionate about something... in this case, instead of directing your passion towards answering technical questions,<br />you prefer to direct them towards putting people down (just take a look at the common mistakes page using terms such as &quot;stupid&quot;), or trying to defend<br />yourself when criticized. If anything is stupid, it is this forum... you would think that when a stable version of a software is released, the people<br />behind it and/or those who have become acquainted with it, would be able to answer very basic questions, for example (what is the stupid<br />error message asking for a file named /etc/network/interfaces, and what the hell is the format of the file, etc. a file that doesn&#039;t even exist in<br />the precompiled version, and this is ONE of the questions that was never answered, and one that was posted months ago by someone else....</p>									</div>

					<p>take a look at the Replies column on this forum and see how many questions have ZERO<br />replies.. like I said.. either people don&#039;t know shit here, or they are too lazy to reply.</p>									</div>
