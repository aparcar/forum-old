					<p>It is SquashFS, so you should have failsafe mode.<br />You are not brick yours, faaaar from it !<br />You&#039;ve just blocked the access.</p><p>In openwrt, the reset button won&#039;t reset settings (by default).<br />And all buttons has null functions except you define your own.</p><p>To obtain failsafe mode, reboot your router (unplug and plug power)<br />when power LED flashing, press Reset button, power LED will flash very fast,<br />then TELNET to 192.168.1.1, use mount_root, then change your /etc/config/network<br />In failsafe mode, there is NO webui.</p><p>Openwrt doesn&#039;t come with webui by default, (except custom build)<br />don&#039;t you remember ?</p>									</div>
