					<p>Summary:&nbsp; WDS client disconnect is causing WDS master to drop transition power to 3.&nbsp; How to debug?</p><p>Details:&nbsp; I was running Arokh&#039;s trunk.&nbsp; I built my own using your recipe above (BTW, huge thanks!).&nbsp; Everything works excellent, except the transition power of the master on the WDS drops to 3 dbm when one of the WDS clients disconnects.&nbsp; The big power decrease happens every time a WDS client disconnects and no other time I have seen.&nbsp; I can reboot a client or hit save on the wifi page and the host will drop the power.&nbsp; I only need to click save-apply on the wifi page of the master to restore it to full power.&nbsp; I have not tried your build, but I am sure it is the same as I do your build exactly.&nbsp; I have 3 wndr3800s.&nbsp; One is the master connected to the main wired internet connection.&nbsp; The other two act as access points.&nbsp; I use the A channel for the WDS (the two access points connect to the master on this channel) and the B/G channels on all three for wifi access if that make sense.</p><p>/etc/config/wireless on master<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-device &#039;radio0&#039;

					<p>Juhosg enabled kernel 3.7 support for ar71xx today, so I made a test build. Seems to work ok.<br />The build is available for adventurous people here: <a href="http://koti.welho.com/hnyman1/Openwrt/">http://koti.welho.com/hnyman1/Openwrt/</a></p><p>(Officially the kernel version for ar71xx is still 3.6.11.)</p><p>------<br />@johnthomas00: I haven&#039;t tested WDS extensively, as there are no special modifications regarding that in my build. The radio driver should be just the standard one.</p><p>@Tacoos: I have been able to connect my USB sticks or HDDs just normally.

But based on that vagueness of the error message, you might try &quot;make dirclean&quot; to clean out all intermediate steps and the toolchain.

./scripts/feeds update -a

make defconfig
make</code></pre></div><p>If you want to fully mirror my &quot;production environment&quot;, follow the advice here to re-create my build environment:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=127011#p127011">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 11#p127011</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 2 Jan 2013, 11:06)</p>

My build does NOT have samba server support. Instead, it has support for the cifs/smb (samba) filesystem and the router can act as a cifs/samba client.
