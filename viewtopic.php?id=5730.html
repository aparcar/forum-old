					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I am trying to breach(modify) the existing synchronization system of Wireless<br />Access<br />Point (AP) to make AP synchronize (time synchronization) with TDP router&nbsp; for our research purpose&nbsp; <br />(http://ip-flow.dit.unitn.it/projectwireless.html&nbsp; &nbsp;).</p><p>I think, that, there should be some modification in beacon generation<br />process<br />and also timestamp, beacon interval field in beacon frame.</p><p>It seems to me, this work should be in lower MAC layer (possibly in driver) which is<br />closed (not open source) by chipset manufacturer.</p><p>Any body knows about madwifi ( <a href="http://madwifi.org">http://madwifi.org</a>/ )<br />main focus of madwifi is Wlan card ( for client)</p><p>But is it possible to use madwifi the driver for customization Atheros<br />based Access Point (embeded linux inside) ?</p><p>if any one knows about that, please provide some information.</p><p>Thanx !</p>									</div>
