					<p>Some time ago I ordered a GL.iNet 6416A on Aliexpress.&nbsp; Actually friend of me did the order.&nbsp; It took about 3 weeks to arrive.&nbsp; (though it can take up to 6 weeks or even longer)</p><p>Compared to other sellers this router comes nicely packed in a nice retail box, and even has a little &#039;getting started&#039; manual, and a USB cable.&nbsp; </p><p>OpenWRT Barrier Braker is the pre-installed firmware on this box when you go to the advanced section you get&nbsp; full acces to the OpenWRT firmware.&nbsp; The basic GUI that GL.iNet provides has a lot of options.</p><p>A Webcam server<br/>Download functionality for USB storage<br/>A cloud server? (I still have to take a closer look at this)<br/>A share (SAMBA server) that also supports NTFS ans ETX4<br/>A UPnP srver<br/>A SSH proxy<br/>NAT port forwarding</p><p>Firmware with auto update.. Hmmm is that safe?&nbsp; &nbsp;But&nbsp; ok this might be better then&nbsp; having firmware with 10 year old bugs that never get patched (as is the case in many mainstream routers) <br/>Please comment on this...</p><p>There is also a dyndns service provided by GL.iNet.&nbsp; </p><p>All in all the GL.iNet people have not been cutting corners.&nbsp; <br/>I wonder if some financial revenue trickles back to OpenWRT?&nbsp; or how does that work?</p><p>And I almost forget to mention it has 64MB RAM and 16MB ROM on board.<br/>See wiki for all the details: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/gl-inet/gl-inet">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/gl-inet/gl-inet</a></p><p>From my noob point of view the basic features of this little box beats a lot of the competition out there. <br/>Specially for people who are not familiar or uncomfortable with flashing firmware I think this is a great way to get started.</p>									</div>

					<p>Antenna range:&nbsp; With a clear line of sight the range is not any worse then other routers. Though walls seem to limit the more then routers that have external antenna&#039;s, There also is a version with antenna and you could hack a better antenna..&nbsp; The Atheros chip seems to do better transmission then the Mediatek (from my NEXX) <br/>I also have a DIR-505 that has a shield over the Atheros chip and that seems to have a little more range.</p><p>From a security point of view i&#039;d say less range is better... But it all depends on what you want to do.<br/>When you run a piratebox then you might want some extra range to be able to chat with more neighbours.</p><p>So the solution would de adding a antenna, there are also active antenna&#039;s that have an amplifier, or directional antenna&#039;s.&nbsp; Or you can make an omni antenna slightly directional by adding a reflector shield behind it? I&#039;ll give it a try to add a little grounded metal shield to the GL.iNet. This might make the PCB antenna directional. ..should work with every antenna...</p><p>The hack WertWert.. referred to seems to be the an easy way that also looks nice.<br/>I just spotted this antenna: <br/><a href="https://www.conrad.nl/nl/tp-link-tl-ant2408cl-wifi-staafantenne-24-ghz-8-db-995744.html?WT.mc_id=gshop&amp;gclid=CIj_tabrtccCFUXItAodRokCMQ&amp;WT.srch=1">https://www.conrad.nl/nl/tp-link-tl-ant … ;WT.srch=1</a> but i&#039;m sure it must be possible to find even cheaper ones.<br/>Or just pull one from an old router...</p><p>I haven&#039;t tried the app. maybe someone else who has this box can do this?&nbsp; I&#039;m not very app-happy. I&#039;m in the phase of my life where i try to get rid of all the spy stuff. (and that&#039;s NOT easy) I can see how an app will let you do nice things, is the app encrypted?&nbsp; I have not looked at it yet. Also no clue what bootstrap is... I&#039;m getting curios though. :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>I am not sure what APP you are refereeing to.&nbsp; I am talking about the web interface to OpenWRT.&nbsp; Bootstrap is the default interface that comes with LuCi, but in general I download and use the OpenWRT Theme for the GUI.&nbsp; Bootstrap has bigger buttons and is easier to run on a small screen, but still not easy.</p><p>As the GL.inet comes with it&#039;s own version of OpenWRT all I was asking is it easier to use on a smartphone, specifically for changing the SSID.&nbsp; </p><p>Theme is managed in System=&gt;System=&gt; Language and Style.</p><p>Bootstrap is not loading a tape to get the computer running, though that may be before your time.</p>									</div>

					<p>@ RangerZ:&nbsp; Yes there is an Extra interface in front of OpenWRT, it actually makes sense.. non tech users can use that interface to do basic stuff without having the risk to do something that locks them out or break a setting. And have a bunch of stuff pre-configured. </p><p>I hope that the guys from GL.iNet read along. i&#039;m sure they will find your comments interesting.&nbsp; To me it makes a lot of sense to have an interface on a mobile router that is smartphone friendly. Would be nice if OpenWRT would have a tiny interface style one day</p><p>@jmomo: Thanks for pointing me to that USB issue.&nbsp; Eventhough it is a sticky one I managed not to see it before...&nbsp; The topic is [SOLVED] des that mean it is fixed and no longer an issue, or merely &#039;we confirm the bug&#039;<br/>I did a rough read in the tread right now, but I didn&#039;t understand it yet...&nbsp; I&#039;ll have a closer look this weekend.</p><p>Has this anything to do with shielding? RF radiation? <br/>Or is it that the Power supply is underpowered? <br/>If a powered hub solves the issue then to me it sounds a bit like the USB drains to much power, that in turn destabilises the wifi....&nbsp; &nbsp;As i said... i will have a closer look this weekend</p><p>TP-link doesn&#039;t come with OpenWRT pre-installed. So for some people the pre-installed BarrierBreaker is a good &#039;feature&#039; on the GL-iNet.</p>									</div>

					<p>Alfie, I loaded the mobile app on my iPhone (post 10).&nbsp; The app is &quot;Media&quot; focused, meaning it&#039;s for some one who wants to use a USB stick and share media.&nbsp; As a business traveler (Road Warrior) I want an app that will make it fast and easy to connect to a Hot Spot\Wifi.&nbsp; While the iPhone app is easy to navigate, it is still I think 3 &quot;swipes&quot; to get to the scan and connect screen.&nbsp; I think that this should be a button on the top page.&nbsp; Scan.&nbsp; </p><p>I also was disappointed that the app does not appear to remember connections.&nbsp; I go to the same office, and coffee shop.&nbsp; I want to remember these, so when I scan it finds and connects (configurable or by prompt).</p><p>I would be happy with an app that ONLY does connection management.</p><p>Will the iPhone app still work if I upgrade the core version of OpenWRT?&nbsp; Similar, will the mobile web interface go way if I load a new version.</p><p>What is the repository for packages.&nbsp; I would like to add OpenVPN in particular.</p><p>For what it&#039;s worth, I would use a USB Wireless (EDIMAX7811) for having a separate WLAN and WWAN for improved performance (not sharing radio)</p><p>Please build a new version with the same features and a battery.&nbsp; A second USB would be nice.&nbsp; 2 Ethernet is important to Road Warrior.&nbsp; </p><p>I sent email about 2 days ago to website email with some similar requests.&nbsp; Please let me know if I can help with more details.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi All!&nbsp; I also have a newly received GL.iNet 6416A.&nbsp; I purchased it directly from Amazon and it arrived 2 days later via Prime shipping:</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/TBMax-Wireless-Router-Support-Mobile/dp/B00PNJRDT4/">http://www.amazon.com/TBMax-Wireless-Ro … 00PNJRDT4/</a></p><p>(I have no connection to this seller, just a happy customer)</p><p>I have upgraded to the latest trunk release candidate (15.05-rc3).&nbsp; Here&#039;s how:</p><p>1. Download the appropriate OpenWRT firmware.&nbsp; Make sure to know if your hardware is a 6416 or 6408 version. (The one I got from the Amazon seller above was the 6416, but that&#039;s no guarantee that this is what you will receive)</p><p><a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05-rc3/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-15.05-rc3-ar71xx-generic-gl-inet-6416A-v1-squashfs-factory.bin">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal … actory.bin</a></p><p>(In the future, as new updates come available, start at <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/">https://downloads.openwrt.org</a>, choose the package you want (e.g. stable, release candidate, etc.), browse through the ar71xx/generic/ directory, and download the appropriate &#039;gl-inet squashfs-factory&#039; package.</p><p>2. Plug in an ethernet cable between your computer and the GL.iNet&#039;s LAN port.&nbsp; Add the power cable to the GL.iNet.&nbsp; The GL.iNet should assign your computer an IP address in the 192.168.8.X space.</p><p>3. From your computer&#039;s browser, browse to 192.168.8.1.&nbsp; If this is your first time configuring the device, it will take you through a few short questions (Language, time zone, etc.).&nbsp; Don&#039;t spend too much time on this, as it will be erased once OpenWRT is installed.</p><p>4. Once into the original GL.iNet configuration screen, click the Advanced Settings (upper right), then System, Backup/Flash Firmware. (You may have to provide a default password along the way.&nbsp; This too will be overwritten shortly.)</p><p>5.

					<p>Also, according to an email from Alfie, the new GL.iNet GL-AR150 (both external and internal antenna versions) should be available from Amazon soon.&nbsp; He sent me a comparison between the AR150 and the 6416.&nbsp; Basically it is the same SoC and memory, but the AR150 will come with an additional LED as well as an on/off switch.&nbsp; PoE is apparently possible with a separate piece of hardware.&nbsp; We&#039;ll see if any other mods need to be made in the OpenWRT trunk.</p>									</div>

					<p>Nice writeup klaberte,</p><p>Is it a wise thing to upgrade from the stable barrier breaker to the CCrc3?<br/>I have CCrc2 on a Mediatek based box, and i ave the feeling that rc2 is causing some issues with nodogsplash. Just can&#039;t seem to find a solution to get it working So therefore i keep BB until CC has a final release.</p>									</div>

					<p>As far as I can tell, you should be able to upgrade and downgrade release candidates at will.&nbsp; Since the OEM firmware is basically OpenWRT with some added bits of code (and UI), you can download and use the squashfs-factory.bin versions in Luci and it will install all the customary packages.&nbsp; Perhaps just do a Luci configuration backup in case you want to roll back.&nbsp; Otherwise, I encourage you to avoid keeping settings from version to version (at least from BB to/from CC).</p><p>RangerZ is who encouraged me to make the leap, and things have gone smoothly so far.</p>									</div>

					<p>I do not know the answer to this question, but it seems to me that as the device already has bb14.07 that you could have used the sysupgrade.&nbsp; Not sure what the proper process is for changing from a &quot;Factory&quot; OpenWRT release?</p><p>How much space shows free in System=&gt;Software?<br/>Did you loose the Gl.inet web interface when you flashed?</p><p>If anyone is on the stock firmware, please document the configuration of the LEDs.&nbsp; I know other routers when upgraded from their Factory to OpenWRT have LED issues (general statement).&nbsp; This will be in the /etc/config/system.</p><p>When you try the smartphone app, I am most interested in how one can call up a saved SSID, and if it connects automatically or manually.</p><p>Thanks for the report and instructions.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>RangerZ</strong> on 24 Aug 2015, 06:39)</p>
