					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have 2 routers:</p><p>- one with whiterussian which is my principal router<br />-one with kamikaze to make some tests</p><p>Since some months, I try to do rules with ip6tables.</p><p>I remark that I can&#039;t use the module state in ip6tables (in whiterussian rc5 and kamikaze 7.09), which is very important for me</p><p>I&nbsp; think it&#039;s possible to make it work with an kamikaze version with a 2.6 kernel, but I&#039;d like to keep my wifi working with nas.</p><p>Somebody has already try to backport it? (for openwrt or kamikaze) </p><p>Thanks a lot :-)</p>									</div>
