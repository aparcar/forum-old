					<p>I&#039;ve used Openwrt successfully in a small campus deployment of about 50-70&nbsp; Openwrt boxes using Linksys 54GL.<br />The Openwrt boxes act as clients/bridges to a Cisco Lightweight wireless network, allowing us to extend wired connections via the built in switch ports.<br />I&#039;ve built my own openwrt from source so I can put in some of my own configs.</p><p>My problem is the deployment/management/scaling of this many devices, as well as security concerns about losing a device (currently I register tha MAC addresses, so if I lose a device I can de-authorize it, but I&#039;m sure this could be improved).</p><p>Has anyone else deployed an Openwrt network of this size or larger? I&#039;m looking for ways to ease the management and deployment etc.</p><p>I&#039;m looking for the best way to:</p><p>- bootup with DHCP, register a MAC/serial based name with DNS<br />- enroll a new device in a certificate authority<br />- install/update wireless keys so the box can become a wireless client/bridge<br />- at every boot, download (signed) updates/configs from a central server (tftp, http etc).<br />- manage QoS/DSCP and queueing/rate limiting<br />- WPA/WPA2 with dynamic key management in client (non-AP) mode?</p><p>- tunnel/bridge layer 2 traffic across an IP wireless LAN. I would like to assign 802.1q vlans on to the wired switch ports<br />and tunnel/bridge it over IP. I&#039;m not sure if Linux GRE supports Layer 2. Cisco uses EtherIP to do this with their wireless gear.<br />For performance I wouldn&#039;t want to tunnel using TCP. MPLS would be an interesting option.</p><p>The reason I&#039;m looking at tunneling layer 2 is that in routed mode there&#039;s a lot of administration, NAT is undesirable for applications, and the built in bridge (wet) mode is not a true bridge mode. There&#039;s also interoperability with the Cisco APs as well.</p><br /><p>Any thoughts?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi jmorrison,</p><p>I realy do not know how I could help you with your very large network, but maybe you can help me?<br />I would like to do the same as you but in small for my environment.</p><p>All howtos and dokumentations do not help me. I do have one access point as master with WPA2 encrytion and 4 access point configured in client mode. The problem is that non of my client get access over the wlan bridge.</p><p>Do you have any documentation for me how to configure my client access points?</p><p>Thanks for any help.</p><p>Regards<br />Christian</p>									</div>
