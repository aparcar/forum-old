					<p>My router has the LTE/UMTS MC7455 module (sim slot).&nbsp; Under Interfaces i selected the LAN interface and modified the protcol from Static IP to &quot;UMTS/GPRS&quot; thinking that when i select it, it will now trigger internet access via the MC7455 module.&nbsp; When i clicked Save &amp; Apply i no longer was able to access my router via Luci.&nbsp; I cant even get access via wifi nor can i access SSH.</p><p>What do i do to regain access?&nbsp; Meaning, how do i switch that interface back to &quot;Static IP&quot;?</p><p>My router is the ZBT-WG3526.&nbsp; Ideally i dont want to factory reset and lose the current OpenWRT firmware on it.</p><p>And btw, i am a total n00b so please walk me through step by step if there is a way to resolve this.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MrRuff</strong> on 8 Aug 2017, 06:05)</p>

					<p>If you&#039;re a complete noob at this why play around with fire in the first place...</p><br /><p>What you can do is..<br />1. Unplug the SIM and plug your laptop in the LAN port and try and access it that way<br />2. Access the serial console via the CONSOLE port on the back of the router (most have one..)<br />3. Reset the router (last option, especially if its been configured to your internet details)</p>									</div>
