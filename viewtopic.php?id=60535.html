					<p>Hello, everyone. I tried to flash my D-Link DIR-601 A1 but need IE6. I couldn&#039;t find IE6 these days.</p><p>Then I found this post&nbsp; <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=44107">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=44107</a></p><p>Flashing a D-Link DIR-601 A1 without IE6<br />Step 2: In your prefered text terminal app, use vim to edit the Backfire factory image, changing only the last character of the file from &quot;0&quot; to &quot;2.&quot; Note: I specify vim here because it&#039;s the only text editor I know that maintains the integrity of the binary file while allowing you to change the last character. Other text editors may also work, especially Unix/Linux editors, but vim is tested and known to work.</p><p>But I don&#039;t know how to use Vim.&nbsp; Would you be so kind changing the Backfire factory image and send it to me please? couponjbc@gmail.com&nbsp; Thank you very much.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>couponjbc</strong> on 26 Oct 2015, 22:51)</p>
