					<p>Dear all,</p><p>I have a Buffalo router WZR-HP-G301NH, with solid power and DIAG leds. After turning the router on, all leds (wifi, internet,...) flash on for half a second, then all off, after that DIAG led is solid on, for around 15-20 seconds. After that, the router restarts (I guess so), and the process above repeats.</p><p>I tried to TFTP original firmware (version 1.79, downloaded from buffalo.jp site), openwrt (openwrt-ar71xx-generic-wzr-hp-g300nh-squashfs-tftp), dd-wrt. In any cases, the TFTP finishes successfully, but after that, DIAG led is still solid, and the router comes back to the restart loop.</p><p>I read in the wiki that I can unbrick my router with the stock firmware with .enc extension &amp; TFTP, without any soldering needed. But I don&#039;t know where I can get such file <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>What should I do now? Please help!</p><p>Thank you very much!</p>									</div>
