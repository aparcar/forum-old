					<p>Hello - I am an experienced OpenWRT user / programmer / hacker and general all around wifi and Linux guy. My research contract at a major university has just expired (project had a funding cutback...damned war keeps scinece from being funded!). I am looking for another gig, either as a contractor or as a permanent employee. I am located in the Cambridge/Boston area but am willing to relocate for the right job. If you have a job, or know of one, please send me an email at my yahoo account, which is my first name appended to my last name, all in lower case (this explaining is just to prevent address harvesting by spammers).</p>									</div>
