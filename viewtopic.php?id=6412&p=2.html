					<p>If the updated USB2 drivers won&#039;t work (and if its a matter of getting it to work - not getting it to work with USB2 speed) - switching to a USB1.1 hub should do the trick. At least it did for me. See previous posts. The C-Media audio adapter seems to be a quite common choice, so you seem to have a very comparable setup.</p>									</div>

					<p>I observed the same behaviour. Now I am running my USB2 devices at USB1.1 speed _including_ audio. Different priorities...<br />Unfortunately, I dont have enough time these days to try nbd&#039;s new drivers - should be so great to be back at full speed!</p>									</div>
