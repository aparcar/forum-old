					<p>Hi Everyone,</p><p>&nbsp; I&#039;ve been working on this for the last 5 hours and I can&#039;t figure out what I am doing wrong.&nbsp; I have been trying to upgrade from whiterussian to backfire 10.03.1 and at the same time move from Comcast to FIOS.&nbsp; Fortunately I have two identical routers so I don&#039;t have to break my comcast connection while I am working.</p><p>&nbsp; The router is a Linksys WRTSL54GS.&nbsp; I am trying to get a very basic config going first -- WAN and wired LAN and nothing else.</p><p>&nbsp; Currently, both WAN and LAN are working, but I can&#039;t route between them.</p><p>&nbsp; Logging into the router with SSH lets me ping &quot;yahoo.com&quot;, no problem.</p><p>&nbsp; My computer can talk to the router&#039;s web interface.&nbsp; But it can&#039;t get out to the internet, even if I type in a raw IP address to my web browser.</p><p>&nbsp; I was able to get it to work briefly by doing something with &quot;bridging&quot;, but I don&#039;t think that is how you are supposed to do it.</p><p>&nbsp; Could somebody please help?&nbsp; I&#039;ll post whatever config info you ask for.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>By default openwrt requests dhcp on wan, distributes dhcp on lan, masquerades between the two.<br />There is nothing hard about it and you don&#039;t need to spend five hours fiddling with stuff.</p><p>In most cases you simply need to reset the cable modem after switching to OpenWrt because it might use a different wan mac.<br />Now you&#039;re talking about &quot;own rules&quot; what does this mean? The default firewall rules setup proper masquerading, no need to change that either - unless of course you want your own rules.</p>									</div>
