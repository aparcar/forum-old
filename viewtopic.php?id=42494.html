					<p>I am not positive because there are too many variants but this could simply be a case of you getting caught by clang! If you execute the following line in your terminal:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ls -lh `which clang` `which cc` `which gcc` `which g++` /opt/local/bin/gcc /opt/local/bin/gcc

lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  admin    27B 28 Feb 20:34 /opt/local/bin/clang -&gt; /opt/local/bin/clang-mp-3.3

This has been a major headache for me. I overcame it simply by setting an environment variable before running make.</p><p>Try this: (You might want to do a make clean first depending on how much messing around you&#039;ve been up to)</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cc=/opt/local/bin/gcc make</code></pre></div><p>What that does is force cc when called to use gcc instead of clang. gcc is defined by your port select command to&nbsp; apple-gcc42 from your report. I have tried many of them and that seems to be the most successful. By the way <br />I am on 10.8.2 (12C60) which behaves the same as 10.8.1 in this instance.<br />Try it and see.</p><p>KFS</p>									</div>
