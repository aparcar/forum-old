					<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>Im trying to get my tp-link TL-WR1043ND atheros router to connect to the network at my university as a client. The &quot;eduroam&quot; network implements WPA2 EAP-TTLS with PAP inner auth. I&#039;ve been using wpa_supplicant to try and connect but I&#039;m not very familiar with certificates and do not know if what i am doing is causing the problem or not.</p><p>On the IT site, they provide us with 3 .cer certificates:<br />AdTrust External CA Root&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp; Root CA I assumed <br />InCommon Server CA&nbsp; -&nbsp; &nbsp;Intermediate CA<br />radius.$myuniversity.edu&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp; I assumed this was the client certificate but am unsure</p><br /><p>I tried combining the certificates into a single file with every possible combination of 2 or all 3 and when I run wpa_supplicant I get a very quick failure of authentication</p><p>If anyone could assist me with this I would greatly appreciate it as I&#039;ve spent many hours and still have made no progress. <strong><span class="bbu">I&#039;d also be more then happy to supply a tip via paypal if someone could get this working for me. </span></strong></p><p>Thanks</p><br /><p>My log when I run wpa_supplicant, it just keeps repeating this over and over<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# wpa_supplicant -Dnl80211 -iwlan0 -c/etc/config/wpa.conf -dd

					<p>Post your config for wireless and wpa_supplicant. <br />When you connect to a backend RADIUS server, you need a RADIUS shared secret. Is it possible the last file is the shared secret? As for the certificates, do not combine them. In the wpa_supplicant file you should only need to point to the root CA cert.</p>									</div>
