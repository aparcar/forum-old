					<p>Hello. I have got a Huawei Hg556a(version a with ralink wifi) with OpenWrt Chaos calmer. The issue is that I need the openwrt firmware with patched phone ports. I can&#039;t compile it, cuz i dont have a Linux pc. If someone could do it for me and us, that would be great. If it is posted in the wrong zone, forgive me and put it the right way. I need some fast help. Thanks and My english sucks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>flafyrex</strong> on 24 Oct 2016, 19:27)</p>
