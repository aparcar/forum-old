So 4.9 and next should be perfectly usable again, minus the random packages not yet ready for 4.9.</p><p>Beside the usual kernel bumps there is also some cleanup work due to several bits having been upstreamed. The first 12 patches are still pending merge. They are the exact same commits so git am will have no issue to drop them should they no longer be needed.</p><p>Add some changes to the accompaning files in swrt.

					<p>Yep.</p><p>The same thing goes for the versions of all the other packages in the system.</p><p>What I tend to do is to run the distro version of most things, but if there are specific packages that are more significant to the system, I will frequently compile and run my own version of them so that I can run the latest upstream version.</p><p>This lets me take advantage of the latest performance improvements (and frequently catch regressions before they become too baked in), and easily get support from the package developers.</p><p>I will start off using the distro supplied version, but when things scale up to start hitting performance bottlenecks, or if I hit a bug, or need a feature that&#039;s in a newer version, I&#039;ll jump to the upstream version for that package. If they supply a pre-compiled binary for my distro, I will use the latest one of those, but if I run into a bug, I need to be able to compile my own binaries to test/apply the fixes, so I always figure out how to do that before jumping off the distro version.</p><p>Many people react to my approach in horror, but it&#039;s not that bad in practice, because there are usually very few packages that you care that much about. If I have a dozen packages across a few hundred machines, it&#039;s a lot. Usually it&#039;s only a handful.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi all, first post just got my WRT1900ACS and successfully flashed OpenWRT and setup a SAMBA drive. I have some questions and hope someone can help. I&#039;ve tried Googling and searching the forum before asking <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> sorry if this has answered already or I&#039;ve missed the answer in advance.</p><p>I have tried to setup a torrent box with a Raspberry Pi 2 and found out the speeds are not great because the USB controller and Ethernet controller share the same bus and the board. From what I&#039;ve read this causes a bottleneck and speeds go up and down as both are trying access the same bus.</p><p>So my question is how is the performance using WRT1900ACS as a torrent box with a hard drive connected to the USB 3.0? Is the dual core chip and 512MB RAM enough to keep up with downloading a torrent while surfing the web and maybe stream a video at the same time?</p><p>And the final question is the same Raspberry Pi 2 is being used with Pi-Hole a DNS sink-hole program to block Ads. I&#039;ve seen there is some similar application in OpenWRT how is the performance and is it comparable.</p><p>It would great to have everything working from WRT1900ACS but I&#039;m thinking it might be asking a bit too much from it and performance is not going to great. Would great to get some opinions before I start installing and configuring only to find out it not powerful enough.</p>									</div>

First a good understanding of shell and make are important. You can aquire that knowlage anywhere. Get into the habit of doing everything only once, ie write a script for the task. As for make, well, publicy maintaining packages will get you the help you need should you run into issues and the man page doesn&#039;t help. To the basics I&#039;d also count knowing a real text editor like vim or emacs and tools like sed grep cut awk and obviously git. I mean if it takes you forever to do any meaningful modifications playing around is just far to expensive. Package managment could be descriped as the discipline mapping package relations into a package managment framework. So obviously the more you know about such relations the easier life becomes.</p><p>So how about going about this. Difficult. Read the Makefiles and scripts that actually drive the package Makefiles. Unlike for example <a href="https://projects.gentoo.org/pms/6/pms.html">https://projects.gentoo.org/pms/6/pms.html</a> OpenWrt doesn&#039;t formalize package managment, certainly not to a point where you could ignore the implementation.</p><br /><div class="quotebox"><cite>InkblotAdmirer wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>With respect to netfilter, I was asking somewhat because I&#039;ve been playing in this area recently.&nbsp; I know most users probably don&#039;t necessarily want or expect a fully functional Linux appliance but if a feature is integrated I would like it to work as expected.&nbsp; Example:&nbsp; I had a case where I wanted to sniff NFLOG messages with tcpdump and this wouldn&#039;t work -- turns out it&#039;s disabled intentionally (no configuration) in libpcap makefile.&nbsp; Now this is easily patched (and I may submit one) but somebody intentionally disabled the functionality -- why, and with good reason?&nbsp; Or is it just to keep size down (which with routers these days should be a configurable option).</p></blockquote></div><p>include/netfilter.mk violates the expectation of the build failing for the issues I pointed out (except for the documentation one).
