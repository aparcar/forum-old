					<p>I know little about networking in general and less about Linux specific networking. I&#039;m not opposed to learning on my own, but I&#039;m not sure what to focus on and it&#039;s easy to quickly get lost in the weeds (iptables, firewalls, etc.) My project requires the OpenWrt device to assign an IP to a single wireless device and then be able to accept a connection on a specified port. That is it. No ethernet, no additional devices, that&#039;s all. I&#039;m using a TP-Link MR3020. It seems like there should be a quick solution/configuration, but I don&#039;t really want to become an expert on networking before I figure out what that solution is. Hopefully someone can at least point me in the right direction.</p><p>Thanks - Dave</p>									</div>

					<p>Disable DHCP and give the client a static IP address, easiest and savest way. Also, if you want more security, change the ip address of your router to something else than 192.168.1.1, make it 192.168.1.69 or something.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the responses. Unfortunately I don&#039;t think I can disable DHCP as I&#039;m connecting a mobile device that doesn&#039;t allow the setting of an IP address manually, it has to be assigned. I tried some experimentation earlier and was just breaking stuff...</p><p>Thanks for the tips on ports 3z1.</p>									</div>
