					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have a Windows AD domain with a couple of computers joined. For most of my clients OpenWrt serves as a DNS server. Dnsmasq is configured to forward DNS queries for my domain (and reverse lookups) to the domain controller.<br />All is working fine, except for dynamic DNS registrations for my Windows clients. Seems that the DNS client is not able to refresh the DNS record of the client through forwarded queries.<br />Is there any way to allow the forwarding of these updates?</p>									</div>
