					<p>I&#039;m *so* close to getting this up and running.<br />In what seems like my final problem, I&#039;ve connected my router to a wireless network, it&#039;s picking up a dhcp address and my computer is picking up a dhcp address from the wrt54g. When I ssh in to the wrt, I can ping both routers in front of me (192.168.5.1 and 192.168.0.1 respectively - many nested routers, don&#039;t ask) and resolve and ping google.com. However, my computer which is on a dhcp address from the wrt (192.168.64.1) cannot ping beyond the wrt.&nbsp; The computer *does* get a gateway address (the wrt&#039;s address) with dhcp. I imagine this has something to do with certain nvram variables that I haven&#039;t set but I&#039;m unsure of what I&#039;ve missed, exactly. I&#039;d appreciate any help. Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Did you following any of the tutorials that ask you to delete the S45firewall? If so, you need to restore it. ssh into the WRT and execute the two commands:</p><p>cd /etc/init.d<br />cp /rom//etc/init.d/S45firewall S45firewall</p>									</div>

					<p>Nope, that definitely didn&#039;t do it. Still can&#039;t ping the router in front of me or anything outside. Any other ideas?</p>									</div>
