					<p>Can anyone help to build an ipk of the latest version?</p><p>Currently, I use official package which version is 2.2.4. i followed the guild in <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/timemachine">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/timemachine</a> . it works. but the write spped seems limited at 3MB/s. if i use FTP protocol, the speed could be 8MB/s and even faster. Maybe the problem is version of netatalk is too old. i need to install a latest one.</p><p>Here&#039;s official site of netatalk.<br /><a href="http://netatalk.sourceforge.net/">http://netatalk.sourceforge.net/</a></p><p>if anyone can help me to build the ipk, that&#039;s really appreciate.

					<p>Much more fun if you do it yourself. And there is a number of dependencies (dependant packages) that you will have to build too, otherwise it won&#039;t install or won&#039;t work.</p><p>Everything is perfectly documented here:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/about/toolchain">http://wiki.openwrt.org/about/toolchain</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build</a></p><p>Good luck!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>maartenjd</strong> on 27 Sep 2015, 22:43)</p>

					<p>Did you ever manage? I just built netatalk 3.1.10, using this: <a href="https://github.com/tobiaswaldvogel/openwrt-addpack/tree/master/netatalk3.">https://github.com/tobiaswaldvogel/open … netatalk3.</a></p><p>Replace PKG_VERSION:=3.0.1 with 3.1.0 and PKG_MD5SUM: with correct checksum (335a23f0df707400caa9b68b08be5e56). See <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/netatalk/files/netatalk/3.1.10/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/netata … lk/3.1.10/</a></p><p>To prevent errors with building kerberos-dependencies, I added --without-kerberos below --without-shadow.</p><p>Also you have to add a + before libevent2, otherwise the package netatalk3 does not appear in make menuconfig.</p>									</div>
