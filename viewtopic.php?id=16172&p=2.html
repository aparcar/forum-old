					<p>Hi Sup and All,</p><p>Once upon a time there were a nice and well equipped device on a fairly good price from a well known vendor called ASUS WL500GP. Then ASUS decided, that this device is too good so they made a similar one and called it ASUS WL500GP V2 (mainly a bit slower processor and the wifi isn&#039;t miniPCI, but builtin, not a big issue), but this was not supported by the much loved 7.09 release. This modification was not advertised, and when I bougth mine I was going for the cheapest as I did not know there are two hardware revisions, and got one of these V2-s, which were cheaper. :-(</p><p>That&#039;s why I&#039;m waiting for almost 2 months now to be able to install an OPENWRT on it, cause I really want to make it into an SSH/SCP server to provide me with an unrestricted, secure and fast file and internet access from my workplace and to be able to use it as a torrent client as well. Currently my Ubuntu does this job. :-)</p><p>On the supported devices page it&#039;s highlithed as WIP (work in progress), and I found that it&#039;s supported since changeset 10693:<br/><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Asus/WL500GPV2">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har … /WL500GPV2</a></p><p>I&#039;m just wondering if this will be included in the new release or not. :-)</p><p>If not then I&#039;ll consider buyibng an other one with HW revision 1 (if I can) and sell this one on e-bay or something (ofc ).</p><p>Thanks for your help in advance and have a great weekend. :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi sup, thanks for the advice. Maybe I&#039;ll give it a try later but as I haven&#039;t done anything similar so far it would take some time for me, and I&#039;m kinda short on that, as we have an ongoing project at the moment (about to be finished). If I do so I&#039;ll share my results. :-) Also I still have the warranty for the box so in the worst case, I&#039;ll do some unrecoverable damage to the flash and return it to the vendor, but I would prefer not to do that.</p>									</div>
