					<p>I built openwrt trunk a couple of days ago.<br />Looks good so far and works well on my WNDR3700v2.<br />The max number of [potential] active IP connections dropped from 16K (backfire 10.03.1-RC5) to 3.8K(svn trunk as of 2 days ago, dont know the exact number). Don&#039;t know why.<br />Max power on 5Ghz band for the higher channels on backfire 10.03.1-RC5 was 30dBm. <br />Trunk only allows me to go as high as 23dBm. Not sure why either. However i havent noticed any &quot;measurable&quot; difference in signal strength detected by my macbookpro, so Im okay with that.</p><p>My question is this. I built my own asterisk package as well. I currently have an &#039;snapshots&#039; based asterisk from the openwrt repository which I want to replace with my locally built package because I added in the invisibility tweak.<br />What is the suggested way for me to install this package and replace the one that is provided by the openwrt packages repository in &quot;snapshots/trunk&quot;?</p><br /><p>Thanks,<br />chhatc</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>chhatc</strong> on 16 Aug 2011, 00:44)</p>

It should read your own index and show the new asterisk package on the list.<br />5) install the new package</p>									</div>

					<p>This certainly did not work for me...<br />Apparently wget (which is being performed in the background to update the available package lists) is insisting that I have a http://xxx location.</p><p>Amy i supposed to force something?<br />I left the opkg.conf the same except replaced the packages URL with the mount point which for my device was /mnt/usb</p><p>regards,<br />chhatc</p>									</div>
