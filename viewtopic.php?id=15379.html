					<p>Hi,<br />sorry for my bad english, i&#039;ll try to make it as short as possible <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />I configured my wrt54g to be a client in my wireless and bridge it to lan.<br />It works perfectly, connected pcs do have internet but the wrt54gl itselfe doesn&#039;t. I tryied to ping google from the openwrt ssh shell but no result (no host).<br />What can i do?</p><p>And another little question: <br />The wireless is in sta mode, does that mean he is just a client or does he alsow &quot;expand&quot; the wireless?</p><p>THX, Finster</p>									</div>

					<p>Could you be more clear ? I&#039;m little confused .....do you have two routers and one of them in sta mode .....?<br />And, from the one you bridged with lan you can access internet. ANd the one in STA mode you can not access internet....<br />that would help us to help you I think ....<br />nathan.</p>									</div>
