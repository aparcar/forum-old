					<p>Being honest I <strong>don&#039;t like</strong> CPE510 factory <strong>firwmare</strong> mainly because don&#039;t let you &quot;improve&quot; things and support forum for this product is very poor in terms of users and questions/answers. You only have the WebGUI to perform changes (Yes, you have <strong>PharOS Control</strong> but it&#039;s basically the same thing!). I want to be able to create scripts, using SSH commands but I don&#039;t want to them be deleted every time device is rebooted. Also the hierarchy of configuration files inside the device (using WinSCP) is very messy. I used Ubiquiti once and you got every configuration parameters in one file (Root SSID, MAC, IP, etc...), in this one only you have is files with iptables everywhere.</p><p><em>The savior:</em> Digging a little I found out that CPE510 can use another firmware (an open one) named OpenWrt. Never have used this product (once used DD-WRT in a router). I guess with OpenWrt things are more &quot;changeables&quot; lets say. I can&#039;t post links!! OMG</p><p>And when I uploaded the firmware in order to perform the change I got &quot;Hardware version is not supported&quot;. After getting this error message I started to &quot;googling&quot; and found several things related such as:<br />- &quot;Firmware is not supported in v1.1 hardware&quot;<br />- &quot;put in tplink-safeloader.c the line CPE510(TP-LINK|<strong>YOURZONE or FABRICATION COUNTRY (CN)</strong>|N300-5):1.1\r\n&quot;<br />- &quot;People still have this unsolved&quot;</p><p>I&#039;m not a developer but I guess this can be solve easily (if only is required to add a line and compile the .bin again). I really need to get rid of CPE510 factory firmware but I&#039;m stuck with this issue. Tried even changing zone after set the device to factory defaults. I could even change the tplink-safeloader.c and compile it again so instead of getting this job done from other person I could solve this with a &quot;recompiling-tutorial&quot;.<br />I&#039;ll google this after post but how can I get this <strong>trunk</strong> (not familiar with this term): svn.openwrt.org-openwrt-trunk@47212 3c298f89-4303-0410-b956-a3cf2f4a3e73. I think the answer is in here.</p>									</div>
