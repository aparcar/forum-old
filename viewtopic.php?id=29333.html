					<p>Hi all, I trying to determine the difference between selecting a particular item as &quot;*&quot; or &quot;M&quot; when using menuconfig. I&#039;ve read the URL here:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build?s">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build?s</a>[]=menuconfig</p><p>It says the following:<br />If you mark with a &#039;*&#039;, the package will be built into the firmware you create.<br />If you mark it with just an &#039;M&#039;, the package will be built but not installed.</p><p>This is consistent with the behavior I&#039;m seeing. Things that I mark as &quot;M&quot; don&#039;t show up in the firmware. For example, if I build the Alix-X86 profile but select &quot;kmod_pcnet32&quot; as &quot;M&quot;, then the pcnet32 package doesn&#039;t seem to be included when I boot the resulting firmware image.</p><p>Is it actually included and I need to do something special to load it? Or is it not included at all and my only option is to select &quot;*&quot;?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>Generally speaking you try to build everything that you want in the final image as * as it saves space.<br />you need to know more about types of images on flash, like whats JFFS, squashfs etc,<br />then again why you cant delete files from certain flash file systems (bcos they are read only), or some of them only mark your files as deleted&nbsp; but never really recover the space you gave them when you created the image.</p><p>If you really wish to know.. then read this<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=2486">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=2486</a></p><p>if you need more info then don&#039;t&nbsp; hesitate</p><p>Cheers!<br />mohnkhan</p>									</div>

					<p>mohnkhan, thanks for the input. As it turns out I&#039;m going to be using ext3 on a 2gig compact flash card in my Alix. I&#039;m not terribly concerned about space, and / or read-only issues as it shouldn&#039;t apply to me. I&#039;ve been building my images with all the things I want included with &lt;*&gt;. I suppose I can use &lt;M&gt; after I have the image deployed to add packages after the fact.</p>									</div>

					<p>I agree. Using a &lt;*&gt; in menuconfig adds them as modules.</p><p>Using a &lt;*&gt; in kernel_menuconfig builds it into the kernel itself.</p>									</div>
