					<p>I&#039;ve managed to install OpenWrt&nbsp; on my TP-LINK (TL-WDR3600) router and have now upgraded it to 17.01.4, It&#039;s IP address has been changed to 192.168.1.3 to avoid conflicts with my pfSense Internet gateway which has 192.168.1.1 assigned. What I can&#039;t do is get it configured so that it can be accessed from anywhere on my LAN.</p><p>The router has 192.168.1.1 assigned as the gateway address and is able to acces the Internet, but accesss to or from the router&nbsp; to the rest of the LAN is disabled apart from one system which is physically attached to th router.</p><p>Can anyone suggest what I&#039;ve overlooked?</p>									</div>

					<p>Post your configuration files from /etc/config on the OpenWrt router. At least &#039;network&#039;, &#039;firewall&#039;, &#039;wireless&#039; and &#039;dhcp&#039; are required.

Do&nbsp; you mean that other devices cannot reach the SSH server on the router? Or they cannot access LuCI on the router? Or they cannot see the pfSense device? Or that they cannot access the Internet through the OpenWrt and pfSense devices?</p><p>How are the pfSense and OpenWrt devices connected physically? How about the devices which cannot operate on the network? Are they on the wireless network?

					<p>pfSense is the DHCP authority for the LAN, dhcp has been disabled on OpenWrt. It has an IP address of 192.168.1.3 to avoid conflicts with pfSense which has an address of 192.168.1.1. This address is the gateway for OpenWrt.</p><p>The OpenWrt router is connected to the rest of the LAN via the Internet port. One LAN port on the router connects one system from which I can ssh into the router. That system has a static IP of 192.168.1.200 and it can only access OpenWrt, but nothing else, not on the LAN or the Internet. Wireless has not been enabled on OpenWrt .</p><p>I have only just started using OpenWRT, so don&#039;t really know my way round the system. The changes from the default configuration amount to setting the IP address to 192.168.1.3 with a gateway of 192.168.1.1 and disabling dhcp. I would post the configuration files but can&#039;t access them from the system which has Internet access. I would copy them to a USB stick, but don&#039;t yet know how to use one on OpenWrt.</p>									</div>

					<p>Plug one of the LAN ports to your existing LAN. When you set up a router as a LAN device, it should not contain a WAN network.&nbsp; You can delete the wan network entirely and move eth1 (the blue &quot;Internet&quot; port on the back) into the lan network to have five LAN ports instead of four.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 24 Feb 2018, 20:44)</p>

					<p>Is the pfSense connected to the OpenWrt router&#039;s yellow LAN ports, or the the blue WAN port? If it&#039;s connected to the blue port, try connecting it to one of the yellow ones instead.</p><p>If you can access LuCI on the OpenWrt router, then you can download a backup of the configuration files from a submenu under &quot;System&quot;. I think it&#039;s called &quot;Backup / Restore&quot;. Just click on the &quot;Download backup&quot;, and you&#039;ll receive an archive file which contains all the configuration files.

					<p>Just as a followup... when the cable from my LAN is moved from the blue to a yellow port, I can no longer access the Internet from OpenWrt, which means I can&#039;t install any packages. To do that I need to move the cable back to the blue port.</p><p>Is there any way to have OpenWrt accessing both the Internet and the LAN at the same time?</p>									</div>

					<p>The firewall does nothing in a device where the only active network is br-lan.&nbsp; If you have a IP, netmask, gateway, and DNS set in the lan section of /etc/config/network, it should set up a default route via your gateway.&nbsp; </p><p>I run my dumb AP&#039;s as DHCP clients, so they are automatically configured from the main router. Then your /etc/config/network lan settings can be as simple as:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;lan&#039;
