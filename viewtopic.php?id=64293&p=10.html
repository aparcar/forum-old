					<p>I think you meant the router webserver which has changed, since there is no way for you to open the modem webserver from an original firmware. Luci is the router webserver used with LEDE, while the modem webserver should look no different with all of the original firmwares. They are for developers eyes only and not meant for end users. You should be able to plug the mini pcie modem into a PC and still have the same old tplink modem webserver. But, it is possible to change the modem webserver since now we have the files required to do so, but unfortunately my modem has a broken hardware problem so not possible for me.</p><p>So basically we have&nbsp; 2 devices in MR200, 1 is the Router itself, and the other one is the LTE modem each with its own operating system. The router runs on linux while the modem on android. </p><p>What you meant is not the &quot;modem software&quot; but it is the router webserver. the modem webserver is the one when you browse <a href="http://192.168.225.1">http://192.168.225.1</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks Heinz for all your work. Used your bin files and updated using the official sysupgrade file. Just wanted to see if anyone managed to get the signal LEDs working accurately?</p>									</div>

					<p>I can post a script if you need for turning on signal leds and 4g led. Not sure if will work with default mr200 modem since I have replaced the modem to other brand. You can change accuracy by changing the threshold numbers and so far I am happy with my settings.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>I recently bought the TPLINK MR200 V1 router from Orange Spain ISP, with his own fw version.</p><p>I would like to convert it to LEDE firmware, but i want to do it in a secure way, step by step to avoid any mistake.</p><p>I printed fulll thread and read it several times to learn all i can, and stay ready for any inconveniency.</p><p>Summarizing, i want to follow this steps:</p><p>1.- Flash stock firmware 160310 via TFTP, editing stock .bin file, cutting 0x200 header, copying 0x20000 bootloader bytes and copying 0x7B0000 router FW bytes, getting a 8.000Kb file.</p><p>2.- Update to stock latest release through webpage, first with 160412 ver. and then to 160905 ver.</p><p>3.- At this point, i will have updated MR200 with latest sotck router FW and LTE modem FW too.</p><p>4.- Flash LEDE via TFTP using @Heinz ArcherC2V1_tp_recovery.bin</p><p>5.- Finally, update from LUCI to LEDE-17.01.4</p><p>I hope all i said is ok and didnâ€™t made any mistake, although any help will be very appreciated, <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />.</p><p>I found post 141 by @Lordcapy, who was in same situation like me, but i canâ€™t contact with him, there is no private message option available.</p><p>One more question, perhaps i will telling something stupid, but since Archer C2 and MR200 basically have same HW (MT7610EN 5GHz chip), Â¿why MR200 5Ghz is not working?, in most recent topics of C2 openwrt thread, i read 5Ghz itâ€™s working ok,</p><p>Thx in advance.</p><p>Best regards.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jmpcarceles</strong> on 6 Mar 2018, 18:40)</p>
