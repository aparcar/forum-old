					<p>I was running LuCi because it was included in latest snapshot.</p><p>However I didn&#039;t realy like the webif so I installed Whiterussian and X-WRT instead. It works fine but I have some problems with language for the interface and I wished the packages was newer. For example there is a package for Asterisk 1.0 instead of Asterisk 1.4 or newer.</p><p>Is Whiterussian discontinued?</p><p>I would like a stable firmware like Whiterussian seams to be. Is Kamikaze 7.09 stable or is there lot of bugs?</p>									</div>
