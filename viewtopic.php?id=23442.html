					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m testing Ubiquiti Nanostation 5M for using them in our OLSR-under-openwrt-based mesh network. I&#039;ve compiled and uploaded the latest trunk 19374 and everything worked fine, even OLSR. Congratulations to all developers for such a universal and updated firmware which is openwrt.<br />However, it would very interesting (and help saving a lot of CAT5 cable) to enable the PoE passthrough feature included in this piece of hardware. Any success on this issue?</p><p>Looking at AirOS software, I think that gpio pin 8 must be set to enable the poe passthrough. I compiled gpioctrl with the openwrt but when I try: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>gpioctrl dirout 8</code></pre></div><p>I get the following error:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Error whilst opening /dev/gpio</code></pre></div><p>It seems that is not recognising the gpio devices... Any ideas on this? </p><p>Thanks</p><p>xavier_martinez</p>									</div>

					<p>I observed a problem on a recent generation 00:27:... Nanostation M5 (mfg date ~August 2011) bricking itself upon enabling the POE passthrough feature (via firmware) shortly after boot.</p><p>The unit did not become bricked simply from flashing it, but rather failed upon the passthrough enable.&nbsp; Also, nothing was connected to its secondary LAN port at the time; it was sitting on the bench.</p><p>I have not experienced this failure upon enabling the POE passthru feature, with stock firmware and otherwise, on older NSM5 units. Maybe there was a BOM change.</p><p>I found recent reports of other UBNT users experiencing the same failure enabling the POE passthrough feature on Nanostation M2 and M5s, when using stock firmware too:<br /><a href="https://forum.ubnt.com/showthread.php?p=270549">https://forum.ubnt.com/showthread.php?p=270549</a></p><p>The suggested work-around, which I have so far tested successfully, is to NOT enable POE passthrough, presumably with any firmware.&nbsp; Rather, swap the Main and Secondary LAN ports, i.e. so that whatever secondary POE device is connected to Main.&nbsp; This will have the effect of the 2nd POE device being always on.</p><p>This work-around comes with caveat of possibly reduced power noise filtering, since the unit will not be receiving its power from the Main port.</p><p>Also, do please note UBNT&#039;s warranty policy of not supporting 3rd party firmware, even despite their wiki providing instructions for flashing OpenWRT onto their products:<br /><a href="http://www.ubnt.com/support/warranty">http://www.ubnt.com/support/warranty</a></p><p>(So, recommendation is to prove out all units with UBNT stock firmware first, especially POE passthru, to screen for any problems.)</p>									</div>

					<p>The observed self-bricking problem occured *despite* using the appropriate 24V / 1Amp POE injector.&nbsp; Please read the forum post I linked to at ubnt.com.&nbsp; There was a BOM error on some Nanostation M5&#039;s manufactured around August 2011, causing the POE passthru function to brick the device if enabled.</p><p>The particular radio of mine that suffered this problem was returned to UBNT for an exchange at no cost.</p><p>I&#039;ve not observed any problems on POE passthru on Nanostations manufactured since then.</p>									</div>
