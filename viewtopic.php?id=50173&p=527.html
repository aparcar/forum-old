					<p>@gufus, Have found both of the latest two mwlwifi releases to be very good. Most of the time I am running with the latest (10.3.0.18-20160823-1) on a lede build. The post you quoted was related to some of us playing with getting a owrt build running with kernels 4.7.x and 4.8-rcx, based on @sera patch-set. Currently experiencing a kernel panic reboot, at least on a mamba device.</p><p>@gsustek, Have not found any guaranteed method of forcing log output. Ya, as @sera posted, doing a git-bisect would be the way to narrow this down, I have not got around to doing anymore owrt builds yet. But there are not that many changes between working, and not working.</p>									</div>

					<p>@sera,Feedback on your last patch-set. I did a 4.8-rc6 build on a new tree and flashed UBI image to mamba device; no change to build, I simply copied across my .config. My intent was to let that run on the off chance I might catch some useful output on the console when it failed. In the meantime I planned on creating a modified build to start looking for the mwlwifi commit causing the grief on previous builds. More than 24 hours later the build is still running and I have not experienced a reboot. Did a quick browse @ kernel.org for any commits as likely candidate for change, but nothing leaps out.</p>									</div>

					<p>Just a note that I personally have no more major issues with the WRT1900AC(S) family -- the last issue I had (bi-directional speed on 5G) seems to have been mostly addressed with recent commits in LEDE source.</p><p>iperf3 -c &lt;target ip&gt; -P6 -t20 yields (ACS to AC, both on LEDE):</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[SUM]   0.00-20.00  sec   934 MBytes   392 Mbits/sec  826             sender
