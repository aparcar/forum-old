					<p>I&#039;m using the last chaos calmer 15.05.1 x86_64 version of openwrt from the download page (I was building my own but I kept running into problems where the packages all required kenerl (= 4.14 but the kernel that came with the version I built using make menuconfig was higher than that).&nbsp; I&#039;ve loaded it in vmware with no problems and am having fun messing around with its abilities.</p><p>One of the things I&#039;d like to do (because why not?) is install vmware tools.&nbsp; I managed to get most of the dependencies it&#039;s mentioned so far worked out but I&#039;ve run into two I can&#039;t figure out.</p><p>The first is it wants the package depmod.&nbsp; Where can I find this package or instructions on how to build it from source on my installation of openwrt?</p><p>The second is it wants the package &quot;more&quot;.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been able to more or less work around this one by creating a smylink to busybox, but I&#039;d like to build the full version.</p><p>Out of curiosity, is there a way to select multiple packages to install on the web interface so I don&#039;t have to keep going back time and again to install all the various packages I want (especially on something like installing various coreutil packages)?</p>									</div>
