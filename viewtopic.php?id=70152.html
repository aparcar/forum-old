					<p>Making a routed client, which is what the ddwrt tutorial was about, is the simplest way to do this.&nbsp; The down side is that it doesn&#039;t truly bridge to any LAN devices that may be connected to the other router.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is not important for many users, in fact it may not even be desired-- for example if the other router belongs to a neighbor (connecting with their permission of course).&nbsp; Basically you are going to replace the typical ethernet connection to a modem with a wifi connection to an existing access point.&nbsp; Your LAN works internally the same as if you had your own connection.&nbsp; It only use the wifi link to access the Internet.</p><p>Start at default configuration.<br />Set your router&#039;s LAN address to 192.168.2.1.&nbsp; You have said the other router is 192.168.1.1 and you need to be in a completely separate range for this to work.&nbsp; If you know the other router is not using 192.168.1.X you can skip this step.<br />Disconnect and reconnect the ethernet cable so your PC picks up the 192.168.2.X address, put 192.168.2.1 in your browser and log into your OpenWrt router again.<br />Go to Network -- Wireless and click Add.&nbsp; Set the new interface as a Client.&nbsp; Enter the SSID and security settings to match the other router.&nbsp; Select wan as the network.<br />Go to Network -- Interfaces -- edit wan -- Physical Settings and <em>uncheck</em> Bridge.&nbsp; The wifi client must be the only device in wan.<br />Go to the main status page and confirm you have an IPv4 wan connection.&nbsp; You should now be connected to the Internet.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 9 Mar 2017, 17:37)</p>
