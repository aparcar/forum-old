					<p>hi!</p><p>I am running Attitude Adjustment and have setup USB storage with block-mount.<br />I was trying to setup my USB drive as new overlay (pivot overlay method) and when executing the command `tar -C /overlay -cvf - . | tar -C /overlay -xf -`, notice how I wrote /overlay instead of /openwrt mount point (this is where my USB drive for overlay was mount)? So i think i filled up the flash memory instead.</p><p>I managed to copy the overlay to my USB drive and set it as main overlay now.<br />So my router is running fine with lots of memory from the USB drive.<br />But How do I clear out my flash overlay?<br />why does /rom say 100%? is this normal?</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>root@OpenWrt:~# df -h<br />Filesystem&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Size&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Used Available Use% Mounted on<br />rootfs&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.6G&nbsp; &nbsp; 120.6M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.3G&nbsp; &nbsp;3% /<br />/dev/root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.0M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.0M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0 100% /rom<br />tmpfs&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 14.3M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;92.0K&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;14.2M&nbsp; &nbsp;1% /tmp<br />tmpfs&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;512.0K&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; 512.0K&nbsp; &nbsp;0% /dev<br />/dev/sda1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3.6G&nbsp; &nbsp; 120.6M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.3G&nbsp; &nbsp;3% /overlay<br />overlayfs:/overlay&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.6G&nbsp; &nbsp; 120.6M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.3G&nbsp; &nbsp;3% /</p>									</div>

					<p>You question is a mess. You need to learn how to ask clear, coherent, questions.</p><p>It looks like you are confused about the OpenWRT mount points and how overlay works.</p><p>I do this myself on one of my routers. I have a 16GB USB flash in one of it&#039;s two USB ports and pivot the overlay to that during boot time.</p><p>/rom is the read-only filesystem. Yes, it being at 100% usage is normal for OpenWRT devices. This filesystem is usually squashfs compressed formatted flash, which is why you can&#039;t write to it, and also why you need an overlay in the first place.</p><p>If you read and followed the instructions for doing this, you should be mounting your internal/flash overlay somewhere already. You can access it there.</p><p>For example, in my /etc/config/fstab file, I have something like this:</p><p># Mount extroot from USB flash<br />config mount<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option target /overlay<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; # option device /dev/sda1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option uuid xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option fstype ext4<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option options rw,noatime,sync<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option enabled 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option enabled_fsck 0</p><p># Mount the internal &quot;rootfs_data&quot; overlay<br />config mount<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option target /overlay-boot<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option device /dev/mtdblock3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option fstype jffs2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option options rw,noatime,sync<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option enabled 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option enabled_fsck 0</p><br /><p>As a result, I can read/write to my internal/original overlay at /overlay-boot.</p><p>Also stop running AA unless you have a good reason to do so. It&#039;s ancient.</p>									</div>
