					<p>I have a NanoStation M5 loco running as a client bridge and a router TP LINK TL-WR1043ND OpenWRT with doing the PPPoE authentication and sending the signal wireless. I need access to the NanoStation via wireless devices connected to the TP-LINK, already tried some ways but not sure (I tried leaving the NanoStation access to the same range of IPs tp link does not work, I changed the range of IPs of nanostation, but it did not work), I can only access the NanoStation connecting the cable directly into your computer or laptop and configuring the IP on the network card. Does anyone know how I can access the NanoStation this way? What would need to make two connections on the same port WAN (PPPoE and static IP).</p>									</div>

					<p>Alvaro. It is not clear to me how things are connected together and in what order. All I understand is that a wireless client of the TP-Link that is running OpenWRT needs to talk to something connection unspecified.</p>									</div>

					<p>Exactly. The world goes through the Nano in bridge mode to the TP which does PPPoE. You want to get from the LAN side of the TP to the Nano. That is what I outlined above. It works I do it. You need an address on the TP&#039;s WAN eth* in the same subnet as the Nano. You can&#039;t do that in the GUI, hence the ifconfig in firewall.user.</p><p>Hang on, just Googled the Nano why do you need that on the WAN side anyway?</p>									</div>

					<p>OK. Really it ought to be different to anything else. Because you don&#039;t want anything else messing with the packets. Normally what goes out the WAN port is encapsulated by PPPoE&nbsp; and the Nano won&#039;t see it, just pass it. The trick is to catch it one interface early and send it as a normal TCP packet. That&#039;s what the ifconfig does.</p>									</div>

					<p>Before I had access normally using nano to make the PPPoE connection, but the firewall NanoStation does not work as I need (eg the drop did not work) and I ended up switching to bridge to use openwrt firewall. So there&#039;s no way to do? The WAN does not allow two connections (PPPoE and Static IP)?</p>									</div>

					<p>The modem is 10.0.0.1 the router is 10.0.0.2 on the eth0.1 interface. That is the WAN not PPPoE-WAN. iptables makes anything coming from the LAN directed to 10.0.0.1 look as though it has come from the router so it goes out the WAN port as an ethernet packet, rather than a encapsulated PPPoE packet,&nbsp; which 10.0.0.1 can see and reply to. Nat takes care of the return.</p><p>So something on the LAN sends to 10.0.0.1 and gets a reply.</p>									</div>
