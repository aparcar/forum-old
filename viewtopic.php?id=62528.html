					<p>I have a GL-AR150 mini router that I have installed OpenWRT on, as well as OpenVPN to use as a client to connect to my provider. I was hoping to use this device to: </p><p>* Connect to wifi in a public location, especially in places like hotels that only allow one connection<br />* Re-share that connection with my devices<br />* Be able to connect the router as an OpenVPN client. </p><p>I&#039;ve done all of this and it wasn&#039;t terribly hard. I am using the Luci web interface. (FWIW I could not make any sense of the luci openvpn app, I couldn&#039;t get anything to start or find any logs so I bailed on that and just use the CLI) </p><p>OpenVPN is running and connects to my provider on startup. </p><p>Everything is working as intended thus far I am just trying to understand how some of it works! </p><br /><p>When OpenVPN is connected all of my traffic is directed through that connection. When I am not connected, traffic routes through whatever the router WAN is connected to. </p><p>What is happening to make the traffic re-direct through the OpenVPN tunnel? I&#039;m trying to understand because ideally I&#039;d like to modify this so that if the OpenVPN connection drops, I cannot access the internet. </p><p>Some screenshots. Please let me know if more information is needed or if I can post up some of the internals of the device.</p><p>So you can see that I set up openvpn, created an an interface called AIRVPN and added the tun0 openvpn device to it. Then assigned that to the firewall zone. </p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/VNO0qx2.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/VNO0qx2.jpg" /></span></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/vjwN1rl.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/vjwN1rl.jpg" /></span></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/SqYUeIM.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/SqYUeIM.jpg" /></span></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/o9r1DKp.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/o9r1DKp.jpg" /></span></p>									</div>

					<p>Your VPN client changes the routing table after establishing a new connection. You can have a look to the routes on the web interface, and compare before / after.</p><p>If you want to block all internet when the VPN is down, I guess you should delete your default route on the WAN / WWAN interface, and create one specific to your VPN provider.</p>									</div>
