					<p>Hi, <br />I&#039;m running opwenwrt whiterussian rc4 in client mode (with some minor iussues) on a WRT54GL . <br />I have understood how to edit files, but cannot figure out how to create a new one that doesn&#039;t disappear after reboot. </p><p>I&#039;d like to try to do some web UI improvements (I need to create some dummy scripts doing iwconfig iwlist and maybe changing LAN IP without needing to provide root password to end user) but every time I try to save something it disappears after rebooting <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> . </p><p>Of course if my GUI improvements will work I&#039;ll release them. </p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
