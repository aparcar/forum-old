					<p>Just wanted to warn the community about a version of great router that has locked firmware update, and that is not listed on the wiki.</p><p>I&#039;ve recently bought LNIB TP-LINK TL-WR710N and planned to update it with OpenWRT. It turned out that even though according to all signs it should be possible, it returns error 18005 no matter what I try.</p><p>Some characteristic signs of this version:<br />- has USB port<br />- version 1.3 according to label on the router<br />- blue LED<br />- foldable North American plug<br />- most writings on the box, on the device and the user manual are Chinese</p><p>The whole web UI is Chinese and there is no way to change it.</p><p>There is a firmware update option, but...<br />- Chinese TP-LINK site has no firmware upgrades for it<br />- official US firmware doesn&#039;t work (error 18005 - wrong version)<br />- all versions of OpenWRT and DD-WRT don&#039;t work as well (error 18005 - wrong version)</p><p>Firmware upgrade is not done in an easy way like in TL-WR703N, it requires setting up an TFTP server locally and then initiating firmware upgrade using web UI</p><p>Probably it could be updated using serial cable, but I don&#039;t have required equipment and I&#039;m not even sure how much ROM and RAM it has available (don&#039;t want to open the case because it would make impossible further sale).</p>									</div>
