					<p>My router setup is like this:</p><p>DSL Modem @ 192.168.10.1 -- Main gateway<br />Openwrt Router @ 192.168.10.254 -- internet access<br />Wirelessly connected to each other through Relay configuration.</p><p>Everything is working fine as my system is rather simple one and just need internet access. Sometimes the main router loses connectivity and i have to either reboot it manually or issue a telnet command to do it. I want to know if it is possible to issue Telnet commands as a scheduled task in Openwrt from the Crontab. Or is there anything else that can be done to either reboot the main router. Main router doesn&#039;t have Openwrt because it comes from the ISP and it works on ADSL and i cant really use USB stick with my second router but i am willing to uninstall Luci and create my own firmware for the router. I already have installed a custom firmware created from image builder. So please tell me any pointers if this is possible. Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>redd_llining</strong> on 7 Nov 2017, 10:34)</p>

					<p>Yes, you can there are many ways but a very simple stupid hack can work too</p><p>inside a script...</p><p>telnet 192.168.10.1 &lt;&lt;EOF<br />userid<br />passwd<br />reboot #or whatever it takes to reboot it<br />EOF</p><br /><p>Most ISP modems have a bridge mode so you can handle all the clients and routing on your own router and that may eliminate the issue the main router is having as well.</p><p>There are other commands that linux has such as expect which would make this more robust</p><p>If your main router can support ssh/rsh that would be the easiest way to go aside from bridging</p><p>FYI telnet is no longer included by default in openwrt so you&#039;d have to add it to your config.</p>									</div>
