					<p>SNAT and MASQUERADE do the same source NAT thing in the nat table within the POSTROUTING chain.</p><p>Explanation</p><p>MASQUERADE does not require --to-source as it was made to work with dynamically assigned IPs<br />SNAT works with static IPs, that&#039;s why it has --to-source<br />MASQUERADE has extra overhead and is slower than SNAT because each time MASQUERADE target gets hit by a packet, it has to check for the IP address to use.<br />IMPORTANT: It is still possible to use MASQUERADE target with static IP, just be aware of the extra overhead.</p><p>UPD: To use SNAT instead of MASQUERADE simply remove &quot;option masq 1&quot; and add new NAT rule:</p><p>config nat<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option src wan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto all<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option target SNAT<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option snat_ip 1.2.3.4 ### Put your IP here</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>carter.himura</strong> on 14 Dec 2016, 18:51)</p>
