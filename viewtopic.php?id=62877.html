					<p>My router is running Designated Driver r48135 and today I was going to install openvpn but &#039;opkg update&#039; threw a lot of errors. It seems that <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/</a> is completely empty at the moment, does anyone have any information regarding this problem?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hardware problems at main Openwrt site. Hard drives to be replaced.<br />There is a news item and tons of bugs about it in the past two weeks.<br />But snapshots were still there a few hours ago.<br />Empty dir might mean that the new hardware is finally being installed. Might be optimistic, but let&#039;s hope the best.</p>									</div>
