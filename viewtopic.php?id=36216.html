					<p>Hi All,</p><p>This is my first post here, so please go easy on me <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> I&#039;ve been running DD-WRT for the longest time on my Asus WL520GU, but I wanted to give openwrt a try. However, I am unable to get DHCP on my WAN connection. Here are the steps I ran through.</p><p>1. Unplugged cable modem (Comcast)<br />2. Flashed kamikaze brcm47xx 8.09.2<br />3. Plugged cable modem back in<br />3. Router Reboots, and I&#039;m able to get into openwrt GUI, but no DHCP on WAN connection</p><p>Now I flashed back to DD-WRT, and all worked fine. I then tried to flash to openwrt backfire 10.03.1-rc6. Ran into the same problem, no outside connection.</p><p>I have a second router that also has DD-WRT on it that isn&#039;t really used (a Buffalo WHR-G54S). I flashed backfire 10.03.1-rc6 on that, power cycled everything, and bam I&#039;m able to surf and get out. I&#039;m stumped at this point with the Asus WL520GU. Can anyone think of what could cause this issue with a brand new factory flash of Openwrt?</p>									</div>

					<p>You were right. I ended up power cycling the router twice before it gained DHCP. This is a more relieving solution <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
