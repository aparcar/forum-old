					<p>I&#039;m currently working on a replacement for the luci2 daemon which is for a company I work for. </p><p>We have looked at our alternatives with luci2 and came to the conclusion that we must make better use of modern javascript frameworks such as angularjs in the gui. We wanted to have a user interface that was easy to program, quick to setup and easy to test. </p><p>So I have started a project called luci-express which is built on top of ubus to communicate with the router. It is also an angularjs application making it very easy for you to extend the gui and still have full freedom regarding the layout. And full multilanguage support is supported too. For that I use grunt and po files.&nbsp; </p><p>The project is located at: <a href="https://github.com/mkschreder/luci-express">https://github.com/mkschreder/luci-express</a></p><p>Please note that at the moment there is not much there but you can test the gui locally using nodejs and running &quot;node server.js&quot;. This friday I have added the code as a package to our in house version of openwrt. </p><p>It would be nice if more people can take a look at the code and see what possibilities we have to develop a fully angular based replacement for luci. </p><p>// Martin</p>									</div>

					<p>@danielchisholm, it works on any device that can serve static files. The angular framework runs in your browser. The gui communicates with device through jsonrpc. Jsonrpc is already implemented in openwrt in the form of ubus daemon. </p><p>So all you need to do to add new functions on the device is write appropriate rpc calls in C (on the device) and then access them easily through the supplied $rpc service in the browser (in angular). <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>@mirko47, try latest commit. If you ever get a &quot;cannot find module&quot; error then just do &quot;npm install &lt;module_name&gt;&quot; in the project directory. It will install the module into local node_modules directory of the project (I wouldn&#039;t use -g option unless you want to install it globally) </p><p>Some notes on latest commit: <br />- plugin and themes system is in place. <br />- rpc forwarding is in place (currently configurable in server.js): no more cross origin request hassle<br />- on demand dynamic loading of all scripts based on config (lots of room for improvement!): no more long list of includes in index.html<br />- many page templates are in place (although not much is implemented yet - much work needs to be done. Most of it involves creating gui pages and connecting them with ubus functions.) </p><p>Page examples: <br />- router/pages/settings.uci - check this out for how to easily set up a complete control panel for all uci funcitons (you will need to modify access control to access the actual uci calls). This example sets up tables from uci configs and let&#039;s the user modify any uci setting. It is available in the gui when expert mode is chosen at the top. <br />- wifi/pages/wifi.general - work in progress right now to implement wifi support<br />- router/pages/status.dsl - dsl info page (although you are unlikely to have that ubus call since I have added it to our local branch) <br />- core/pages/overview - a work in progress front page<br />- app/init - init script that loads all resources first time application is loaded. </p><p>Note that if you run local server, you may not be able to access some pages unless you also have dummy json rpc calls implemented locally. Also there will be numerous rpc calls missing unless you use the same hardware that I&#039;m using. Local server currently works best by simply forwarding ubus calls to an actual hardware (so you avoid having to copy packages to the router - but it does not actually do much apart from handing autologin and providing the application with a full menu). I will look into a possibility of making the gui automatically detect available rpc calls and gracefully regress to a more limited gui if some calls are missing.. </p><p>You can easily add new pages by doing the following: <br />- add your page either to existing plugin or create a new plugin. Create an html file and a js file. Same name, different extension. <br />- add a reference to the page to plugin.json in the plugin directory.<br />- add your plugin to main config (js/config.js) if it is not already there<br />- add a menu entry for your new page into the access control enabled menu config in share/menu.d </p><p>if you have questions, feel free to post them on github project page.</p>									</div>

If the client decides they want to ship it with their routers, it will definitely go higher up on the priority list. </p><p>There are several steps to implement support for new configuration: </p><p>First you need to decide on how you are going to organise your settings. All config style settings will then go into UCI configs which the gui can easily access and modify using ubus calls. When user changes stuff in the gui, the easiest way to apply the settings is to store it back to uci and then to have a script that runs in the background on the router apply them to running services like openvpn. So that&#039;s how you would implement it if you decide to do it yourself. </p><p>The gui is at the moment like 3 weeks old. So as you may imagine it is not very complete yet. But the good news is that it is very easy to work with and you can easily add new pages that modify settings in the uci model. Also in the latest develop branch I have been working on a new way to access uci settings that eliminate all need to write glue code almost to the level of requiring only two calls to load and apply settings. So in the future it will be even simpler to work with settings pages and add new ones to the interface.</p>									</div>

					<p>The angular library that is executed in the web browser is about 125kb - a file that must be stored on and served from the router. For devices with 4MB Flash this might be a real challenge... and with 8MB of flash it might not be the right priority. It is of course possible to use a public link to Angular instead of serving from the router, but then the OpenWrt GUI won&#039;t work without an internet connection.</p><p>Perhaps<br /> - it would be possible to generate a subset of Angular to get a smaller library<br /> - it could replace other components (in Luci) that also take up storage space</p>									</div>

					<p>@zo0ok, jquery library used in luci2 is 264kb. Your point being? </p><p>But if space is an issue I have some good news for you: you don&#039;t even have to store the app on the device. Just write ubus plugins in C and store them on the device. Then run your app locally on PC or have a small index.html file on the device that loads everything from elsewhere on the internet. And you eliminate the space problem completely. </p><p>In the repo there is a server.js file. You can run it using &quot;node server.js&quot; and it will run a local server that supports logging in remotely to a device over rpc. So you can use it to test things. Be sure though to run &quot;cd luci-express; npm install&quot; first so that you get all the nodejs plugins installed before you run the local server...</p>									</div>

This is because juci (luciexpress or lua-uci in javascript instead of lua) does not run on the gateway but instead runs in the client browser. This allows us to have really compact and small backend that just parses and responds to json messages and all the heavy gui creation can be moved to the client. But this also means that we would need to rethink current code that is available in luci because that code is written in lua and runs directly on the device instead. </p><p>The upside is that it is about 70% less code with angular than it is with luci. :-)</p>									</div>
