					<p>Hey guys,</p><p>I&#039;ve been trying to get a usb interface working for this router. my strengths are with hardware far more than software however....</p><p>I need a version of the firmware compiled with usb in the kernel (if I understand correctly) to be able to access the usb port.

In luci the dlink router says its a TRENDnet TEW-712BR. I decided to add the lines #include &quot;dev-usb.h&quot;&nbsp; and ath79_register_usb(); to /target/linux/ar71xx/files/arch/mips/ath79/mach-tew-712br.c&nbsp; but this doesn&#039;t do anything, so my guess is this is not the right file and or I am not in the right place.</p><p>I&#039;ve also socketed the eeprom so any changes I make to the firmware can very easily be reverted back to stock firmware. I noticed that the luci interface doesn&#039;t seem to want to flash new firmwares as I compile them so this has helped me a lot. </p><p>I really appriciate any help I might recieve. I will be in the meantime tinkering on my own and see how far I can get.</p>									</div>

					<p>The luci build that fwah posted works well, but after a few days, the wifi signal disappeared. When I changed the transmitter power level and saved, wifi came back to life. Don&#039;t know if it is a problem with the luci firmware, or with the router itself. Changing the power level did not cause the router to reboot btw., so it leads me to believe the failure was in the firmware programming.<br />Anyone else had this problem?<br />It&#039;s a shame that the gargoyle firmware doesn&#039;t save the settings as it seems to work very well.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>limboz</strong> on 18 Aug 2013, 07:06)</p>
