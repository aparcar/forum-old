					<p>Hey guys,</p><p>I&#039;m looking to get another router to add to my list of openwrt devices. So far I already own 2 wrt54g (version 2) and a NSLU2. For my next addition, I want to get a router with a usb port and possibly mini-pci. For now, I just plan to use it as a wirless&lt;-&gt;ethernet bridge, but I&#039;m sure I&#039;d like to do many other interesting things with it in the future. My budget is about $100.</p><p>With this said, what does everyone suggest? So far, I&#039;ve been considering these, but I have a few concerns with each:</p><p>WRTSL54GS - Can&#039;t seem to find it anywhere, also no mini-pci.<br />WGT634U - readily available and cheap. Has an Atheros card! I&#039;ve seen comments about it not being a reliable device?<br />WL-500gp - I need version 1 and all I can find is version 2<br />WL-500w - Can&#039;t seem to find a whole lot on this one. Hardware supports 802.11N. Comments indicate that it&#039;s nearly identicle to the WL-500GP. Is this my best bet? Will we ever see 802.11N support on this chipset? How hard is this thing to get working?</p><p>Given my budget and requirements (USB and mini-pci expansion slot), are the above decent choices? What&#039;s my best bet?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>I ended up getting the WL-500w ($75 after MIR, $99 before on newegg + free shipping).</p><p>Yanira - My budget was $100, I price Alix systems and after I tallied up all the costs it was going to be over $200 for everything. For that much, I&#039;d have a lot more options (for example: <a href="http://www.via.com.tw/en/products/mainboards/">http://www.via.com.tw/en/products/mainboards/</a> I&#039;m sure there are others.) I like what Alix is doing, but once you get over $200 or so, there are a ton of options. Also, 1/2 the fun is in the hacking.</p>									</div>
