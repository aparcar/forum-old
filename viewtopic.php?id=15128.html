					<p>I read about this router in the wiki, but I think the article isn&#039;t totally clear: On the one hand there is written, that there are intentions to get OpenWRT running on this box, on the other hand under installation there is written just to use the tftp installation (i did such stuff with my two SE505 and ddwrt).</p><p>Can anyone say, if openwrt runs on this box? <br />I don&#039;t need a big amount of features on this box, just need support for client mode on this box.</p><p>Thx for help!</p>									</div>
