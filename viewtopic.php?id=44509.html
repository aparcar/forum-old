					<p>I have a Mikrotik Router with a configured Hotspot on Vlan1 and a internal Vlan on Vlan2.</p><p>I would like to use Tp-link AP with Openwrt as AP with multiple SSID&#039;s for each Vlan.<br />When I configure the Vlan with Luci in the &#039;Switch&#039; tab, I am able to set the vlanto the ethernet Interfaces.<br />Dhcp and vlan from Mikrotik are working correctly on the configured Ports,<br />but how do I pass the Vlan to the Wlan SSID&#039;s?</p><p>I set up a seperate Inerface which bridges the appropriate Wlan ssid with the vlan switch port,<br />but the vlan is not working with the ssid&#039;s</p><p>Any Ideas?</p>									</div>
