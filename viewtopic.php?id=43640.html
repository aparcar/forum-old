					<p>Greetings gents. I&#039;m looking to port OpenWRT to iiNet&#039;s &quot;Budii&quot; (the 2nd largest ISP in Australia&#039;s latest modem)</p><p>I&#039;ve written up a ticket here <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/13345">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/13345</a></p><p>I&#039;ve also copied copied the GPL code &amp; binary files here <a href="http://intelminer.com/Budii">http://intelminer.com/Budii</a> (as well as cell phone pictures of the chips and pin headers on the device)</p><p>I&#039;m slowly trying to piece together what does what, as this device has a LOT of pin headers on it</p><p>I think it would make an excellent addition to the OpenWRT ecosystem, especially as it comes with things like a built in (8GB) USB drive (expandable, is a standard USB drive behind the back panel)</p><br /><p>I&#039;d love to get feedback on what people think of this device, as well as helping clean up the patches (they date from kernel 2.6.30) to the latest bcm63xx kernel sources (3.6.11 I believe?)</p>									</div>
