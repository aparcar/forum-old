					<p>I was wondering whether Openwrt is overclocking at all? Before you post a response of me being a little loopy just read the nex sentence. I recall that to sync with one of the chips (i think it&#039;s either wifi or switch) it&#039;s better to overclock the Broadcom WRT54g chip to 216 MHZ? This was apparently done for the Linksys stock firmware eventually even. I know that several other distros (Thibor and ddwrt) did this too. Are they overclocked to that speed for OpenWRT? I understand that it&#039;s not exactly a &quot;faster&quot; speed, but one more in sync with some components.</p><br /><p>This post is somewhat vague:<br /><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=9102">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=9102</a></p><p>Is it good or not? Considering I was using Thibor for some time I guess my routers even ran at 216, so will it brick my router?</p><p>This post actually refers to specific problems that are fixed by this minor overclocking:<br /><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=2937">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=2937</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>napierzaza</strong> on 5 Aug 2007, 03:28)</p>

					<p>Overclocking to 216 was to correct a specific issue on the WRT54G v2.2 only (which I happen to have).&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve run the v2.2 router at 216 with WhiteRussian without problems.&nbsp; It&#039;s my understanding that you don&#039;t &quot;have to&quot; overclock any other WRT54G or GL versions - and (with the exception of the v2.2) it&#039;s generally not recommended.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>regloss</strong> on 5 Aug 2007, 05:47)</p>

					<p>I don&#039;t think the issue affected only the 2.2 model - I used to have a WRT54G 3.1 that came overclocked to 216MHz as well.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have overclocked both my WRT54GS&#039; (I think version 2) to 216 last night and as far as I can tell it is not any less stable. Speeds over my STA to AP link appear slightly faster but that might be because I updated one of the APs to Kamikaze 707.</p>									</div>

					<p>It works, believe. I&#039;ve had trouble with my parallel port in the past, and how annoying it can be. But the jtag cable just came together really simply. Not to mention how it was able to delete the nvram on the first try, and the router just come right back up.</p>									</div>

					<p>I realise this thread&#039;s a bit old. But it&#039;s fairly newer than the other one I&#039;ve been reading. So.</p><p>Try Flickr or Wikimedia,<br />or just imageshack.us it and post right here</p><p>This is my first post. I&#039;ve been reading for a while before I registered. I just bricked my WRT54GS a few hours ago by overclocking it. I read up on this page linked below which helped alot (and is relevant to the topic in this thread too). It&#039;s linked on google directly. I&#039;m connected directly to the net right now.</p><p><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=12371">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=12371</a></p><p>And I found this thread after registering. And decided it was time to post. The only thing left for me to do is the JTAG cable but I needed to ask something before I went on. The power keeps flashing when I turn the router on. That&#039;s supposed to mean it&#039;s being reset, aka bricked. </p><p>I got connected to the net when I was still trying to connect to the router. It just went right through to the WAN port. The ports 1-4 lights are blinking too and data is going through the router. It really doesn&#039;t look like something that&#039;s bricked, aside from the not booting or pinging or resetting to defaults if I hold the reset button for 40 seconds. Is this normal behaviour? </p><p>I also tried putting it in the freezer, that didn&#039;t work <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p>									</div>
