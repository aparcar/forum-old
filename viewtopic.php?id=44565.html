					<p>Hi,</p><p>I wanted to use WDS across the 5GHz range with two WDR3600 routers, but the Wifi tx power is limited to 17dBm in this range. The limit in the UK is as follows (non-DFS), from <a href="http://wireless.kernel.org/en/developers/Regulatory/Database?alpha2=GB">http://wireless.kernel.org/en/developer … ?alpha2=GB</a>:</p><p>Band [MHz] &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Max BW [MHz] &nbsp; &nbsp; Flags &nbsp; &nbsp; Max antenna gain [dBi] &nbsp; &nbsp; Max EIRP [dBm (mW)]<br />2402.000 - 2482.000 &nbsp; &nbsp; 40.000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; N/A &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;20.00 (100.00)<br />5170.000 - 5250.000 &nbsp; &nbsp; 40.000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; N/A &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;20.00 (100.00)</p><p>This has been explained elsewhere by the EEPROM having a hard coded limit, due to the cumulative effect of transmitting at 17dBM and having a 3dBi tx antenna.</p><p>After looking a bit further into it, this doesn&#039;t seem correct, as the 2.4GHz range can have its power set to 20dBm (100mW), which is the correct limit in Europe.</p><p>I tried setting the power manually in /etc/config/wireless for the 5GHz band, but it appears to get overwritten on restart.</p><p>The difference between the power of transmitting at 17dBm and 20dBm is 100% (x2), so this makes a big difference to the range of the 5GHz band.</p><p>Any ideas?</p>									</div>

					<p>This article seems to cover the issue:</p><p><a href="http://penturalabs.wordpress.com/2013/05/16/is-your-wifi-ap-missing-channels-12-13/">http://penturalabs.wordpress.com/2013/0 … els-12-13/</a></p><p>This suggest that there is a bug in the EEPROM that is defaulting the country code of the 5GHz device to &quot;0x0&quot;, which is the US. This confuses the available configurations for this band when a crda lookup is used to retrieve viable frequency bands.</p><p>What is strange is that the same lookup appears to be being used for the 2.4GHz device, but this is not overriding the correct bands and powers for that range:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>[&nbsp; &nbsp; 9.310000] ath: EEPROM regdomain: 0x0<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 9.310000] ath: EEPROM indicates default country code should be used<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 9.310000] ath: doing EEPROM country-&gt;regdmn map search<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 9.310000] ath: country maps to regdmn code: 0x3a<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 9.310000] ath: Country alpha2 being used: US<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 9.310000] ath: Regpair used: 0x3a</p></blockquote></div><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>[&nbsp; &nbsp; 9.330000] ath: EEPROM regdomain: 0x0<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 9.330000] ath: EEPROM indicates default country code should be used<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 9.330000] ath: doing EEPROM country-&gt;regdmn map search<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 9.330000] ath: country maps to regdmn code: 0x3a<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 9.330000] ath: Country alpha2 being used: US<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 9.330000] ath: Regpair used: 0x3a</p></blockquote></div><p>The blog post goes into some interesting, but complex, hacking to alter the &quot;regulatory.bin&quot; file used in crda lookups. I&#039;d rather avoid having to do this if possible.</p><p>If the 2.4GHz band is not limited by this bogus lookup, then why is the 5GHz band?</p>									</div>
