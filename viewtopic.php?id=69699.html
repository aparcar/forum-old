					<p>Although many&nbsp; supported routers have 1-2 USB ports for files/media storage, it is a major pain to make an USB work.<br />Followed instructions on WIKI, in a putty terminal, installed k-mod packages, learned about different file systems, formatting, and mounting USB device.....and an hour later I was finally able to see files on the USB drive.<br />Still I have not overcome a problem, that when USB removed and reinserted it then shows as a different device, sdb1, sdb2, sdc1, etc...</p><p>Is there any option available in LuCI to do this in a nice GUI environment, and USB device can be automounted with a simple mouse click and it will show where it is ?</p><p>(I have seen such already in Tomato USB)</p>									</div>

					<p>There are instructions on the extroot page (<a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/extroot">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/extroot</a>) on how to mount a drive using the UUID instead of the name at /dev, so you do not have to guess each time where did it end.</p>									</div>
