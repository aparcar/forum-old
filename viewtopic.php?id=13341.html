					<p>I have make a mistake to install kamikaze 7.09 in my Buffalo WHR-HP-G54 router, it seems lucky, it was not bricked and work correct, but there is a problem, I need to install quagga to the router, but quagga is not in the package list of kamikaze, and I found it in the package list of white Russian, I have tried to install white Russian,&nbsp; but it fail, I follow the procedure of install kamikaze, I ping the router continuously, in general, when the router boot up, there will be 3 seconds to tranfer openwrt with TFTP, after install kamikaze, the &quot;3 seconds&quot; missing and timeout I ever tried to tranfer openwrt, the procedure I follow as following:</p><br /><p>Windows 2000/XP TFTP Client short Instructions</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; * Open two command windows (Start-Run-Enter &quot;cmd&quot;)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * In one window, type &quot;ping -t -w 10 192.168.1.1&quot; and press enter. 192.168.1.1 is the router IP.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Ping will continuously try to contact the wrt with 10 ms timeout instead of default 4000 ms. Keep this running<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the other window, prepare the tftp command &quot;tftp -i 192.168.1.1 PUT OpenWrt-gs-code.bin&quot;. Do not press enter yet!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Now you may plug in the router (unplug it first if it was plugged).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * In the ping window it will start saying &quot;Hardware Error&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Return to the tftp window. As soon as the ping window starts to answer again, press enter in the tftp window.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * The image should now be flashed without multiple tries.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * If ping starts with &quot;Hardware Error&quot;, then starts to answer, and then returns to &quot;Hardware Error&quot; again for a short moment, you waited too long.</p><p>any idea or suggestion? thank you</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>denniwong</strong> on 10 Nov 2007, 18:30)</p>
