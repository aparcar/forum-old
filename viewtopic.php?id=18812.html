					<p>I was wondering if anyone has installed Openwrt on a WRT54G-TM.&nbsp; I see that this router will run DD-WRT, but I am interested in trying Openwrt.&nbsp; It seems like it just isn&#039;t mentioned int the documentation or any Google searches.&nbsp; </p><p>Thank you for your time,</p><p>Samuel</p>									</div>

					<p>I just installed X-WRT (openwrt-wrt54gs-squashfs.bin) on my Linksys WRT54G-TM without any problems.</p><p>I followed the method detailed for installing dd-wrt:<br /><a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/WRT54G-TM">http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/WRT54G-TM</a></p><p>and I also looked at these sites (in case I bricked the router):<br /><a href="http://www.nosloop.com/index.php?section=8">http://www.nosloop.com/index.php?section=8</a><br /><a href="http://www.thenorth.com/apblog4.nsf/0/668D65A56B02BB4B852570A400535F16">http://www.thenorth.com/apblog4.nsf/0/6 … A400535F16</a></p><p>The basic outline is update CFE, tftp flash DD-WRT, update firmware to openwrt</p><p>So I downloaded three files using &quot;wget -c $filename&quot;:<br /><a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/dd-wrtv2/downloads/others/tornado/CFE_Updater/CFE_Updater-WRT54G-TM.bin">http://www.dd-wrt.com/dd-wrtv2/download … 54G-TM.bin</a><br /><a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/dd-wrtv2/downloads/others/eko/V24_TNG/svn12548/dd-wrt.v24-12548_NEWD_mega.bin">http://www.dd-wrt.com/dd-wrtv2/download … D_mega.bin</a><br /><a href="http://downloads.x-wrt.org/xwrt/kamikaze/8.09/brcm47xx/default/openwrt-wrt54gs-squashfs.bin">http://downloads.x-wrt.org/xwrt/kamikaz … uashfs.bin</a></p><p>I shutdown my laptop&#039;s eth0 and wlan0 interfaces:<br />/etc/init.d/net.eth0 stop<br />/etc/init.d/net.wlan0 stop<br />ifconfig wlan0 down</p><p>and connected my laptop to one of my WRT54G-TM lan ports.</p><p>I chose not to configure two virtual addresses for my NIC (eth0 and eth0:1)<br />but to just setup a single NIC address:</p><p>ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0; route add default gateway 192.168.0.1<br />and browsed with firefox to <a href="http://192.168.0.1">http://192.168.0.1</a></p><p>Under Administration-&gt;UpgradeFirmware <br />I selected &quot;CFE_Updater-WRT54G-TM.bin&quot; and clicked OK.</p><p>My browser said the task was done, and my router&#039;s power light began blinking.<br />Eventually my browser timed out (no connection to 192.168.0.1) <br />which was expected since router should no be 192.168.1.1</p><p>So I reconfigured my NIC to 192.168.1.2<br />/etc/init.d/net.eth0 stop<br />ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.2 netmask 255.255.255.0; route add default gateway 192.168.1.1</p><p>Now I could ping my router at 192.168.1.1<br />So I tried browsing to <a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a> without success (This was unexpected!)<br />So I waited some more, but still couldn&#039;t connect via http to router.<br />So I decided to try and flash the dd-wrt firmware &quot;dd-wrt.v24-12548_NEWD_mega.bin&quot; <br />but that too was unsucessful.</p><p>Next, I decided to press the reset button for 30 seconds, then power cycle the router.<br />When &quot;ping 192.168.1.1&quot; got a response I then succeeded in flashing the dd-wrt firmware:<br />using the tftp client from <a href="http://redsand.net">http://redsand.net</a></p><p>/usr/bin/linksys-tftp 192.168.1.1<br />&gt; binary<br />&gt; trace<br />&gt; rexmt 1<br />&gt; timeout 90<br />&gt; put dd-wrt.v24-12548_NEWD_mega.bin admin<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;transferred so many bytes<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;transferred so many bytes<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;...<br />&gt; quit</p><p>The router&#039;s power light began blinking but eventually stayed lit and I was able to <br />browse to <a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a> <br />and was now into DD-WRT<br />Then I used Adminstration-&gt;FirmwareUpgrade to upload X-WRT &quot;openwrt-wrt54gs-squashfs.bin&quot;</p><p>The router began blinking again, and when it stayed lit, <br />I hit the refresh button and was now looking at X-WRT</p><p>turnkit said he could not directly upgrade from one version of operwrt to another version (.bin)<br />without first changing back to dd-wrt.<br />The openwrt site says that if you&#039;re upgrading from Linksys firmware to openwrt, that you need to use<br />the .bin firmware files which contain header needed by Linksys, but otherwise to use the .trx files which<br />lack the header.</p><p>[UPDATE]<br />I successfully upgraded from X-WRT 8.09 to <br />10/03/09 snapshot (bleeding edge r17821 with kernel-2.6.30.8 )<br />using X-WRT&#039;s webif2 Firmware-&gt;Upgrade utility<br />with the trx image <br />(<a href="http://downloads.x-wrt.org/xwrt/kamikaze/snapshots/brcm47xx/default/openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx">http://downloads.x-wrt.org/xwrt/kamikaz … uashfs.trx</a>)</p><p>So once you&#039;re running openwrt you need to upgrade using .trx firmwares.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>redwood</strong> on 7 Oct 2009, 00:28)</p>

					<p>Please note that this guide is ONLY for the WRT54G-TM router and nothing else. Do NOT attempt to use this method on any other device, as it is written ONLY for the WRT54G-TM router.</p><br /><br /><p>In order to flash this router you need to do the following steps:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; * Download the DD-WRT firmware (v24-SP2 build 12548 OR NEWER is suggested) </p><p>NOTE: Check the Peacock thread for recommended build numbers if unsure.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; * Download the TFTP utility<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Download Tornado&#039;s CFE_Updater-WRT54G-TM.bin<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Turn OFF/Disable any AV/Firewall on your pc.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Make sure your pc is wired to a LAN port on the router when flashing. </p><br /><p>Note to new users: Do your research and find out what the latest build is and use it from the start, unless there are issues with the latest build preventing the WRT54G-TM from operating properly, then go to a previous build.</p><br /><p>1. The default LAN IP Address of the Linksys WRT54G-TM is 192.168.0.1. You will need to set a Static IP Address on your computer for this procedure. If you are on Windows I suggest that you reset the router to it&#039;s defaults and set 2 LAN IP Address on your network controller to speed up the process, otherwise once you upload the CFE_Updater-WRT54G-TM.bin you will need to change your LAN IP Address from 192.168.0.2 to 192.168.1.2 to be able to TFTP DD-WRT onto the router.</p><p>On Windows XP, Control Panel/Network Connections/right-click on Local Area Connection icon and select Properties. On Windows Vista, Control Panel/Network and Sharing Center.</p><p>Go into the properties of the Local Area Connection/Internet Protocol TCP/IP and set the static IP address.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;IP Address: 192.168.0.2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Default Gateway: 192.168.0.1</p><p>Click the Advanced button in the TCP/IP setup window and in the IP Address section click the ADD button to add the following 2nd IP Address to the adapter:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;IP Address: 192.168.1.2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0</p><p>Then click OK on each screen. Your network interface card (NIC) now has 2 LAN IP Address statically set on it, 192.168.0.2 and 192.168.1.2. This will allow your PC to communicate with the router before and after replacing the CFE on it. It will also allow you to be able to tell when the router is ready for a TFTP upload.</p><br /><p>2. Open a command prompt window and type ping -t 192.168.1.1 and hit enter. Leave this window open.</p><br /><p>3. Log into the WRT54G-TM&#039;s web interface @ <a href="http://192.168.0.1">http://192.168.0.1</a> (assuming that the router has been reset to defaults) and go to the Administration Tab - Firmware Upgrade. Upload the CFE_Updater-WRT54G-TM.bin to the router.</p><br /><p>!!!ATTENTION!!! You MUST wait at least 5 minutes after clicking the Upgrade button to allow the CFE_Updater to replace the stock CFE on the router and for it to erase the rest of the flash, otherwise you will brick your router.</p><br /><p>A few seconds after clicking the Upgrade button the Linksys web interface will report that the upload has been successful and the power light will begin flashing on the router. Do NOT assume that the CFE replacement/flash erasing/reboot process has finished as the power light will continue to flash after it has rebooted. So there is no way to tell when it is ready for you to TFTP the DD-WRT firmware to it except when you begin to see the ping respond.</p><p>So once it is finished replacing the stock CFE and erasing the rest of the flash, the router will reboot. When the router is ready for the TFTP upload of the DD-WRT firmware, you will see the ping -t 192.168.1.1 begin to respond in the command prompt window that you opened before.</p><br /><p>4. Start up the TFTP utility and set the following:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Server: 192.168.1.1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Password: &lt;leave blank&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;File: &lt;path to dd-wrt.v24-12548_NEWD_mega.bin&gt; (or whichever build you wish to use)</p><p>Now click the Upgrade button. Once the firmware is sent to the router, it will reboot. The power light will change from flashing to solid when it is ready to be configured @ <a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a></p><p>If you do not see a progress bar as the tftp utility transmits the file, you may need to power cycle your router. Wait until the tftp utility has finished its attempts, then power cycle (possibly waiting a few seconds) and wait until you can ping 192.168.1.1 before clicking Upgrade again.</p><p>A few notes:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; * Tornado has made it so that the router will retain it&#039;s MAC Address that is on the label on the bottom of the router with the new CFE replacement.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Tornado is in the process of making a revert bin for those who may choose to revert back to the stock Linksys firmware (god only know why) </p><p>Many thanks goes out to Tornado, Eko, and Brainslayer for their work on this!!! Cool</p><p>No more will you need to void your warranty by opening the WRT54G-TM to JTAG DD-WRT onto it, or spending $70+ USD for a WRT54G-TM pre-loaded with DD-WRT from eBay </p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><p><a href="http://kerjakeras.com/mengembalikan-jati-diri-bangsa/">Mengembalikan Jati Diri Bangsa</a>|<br /><a href="http://kerjakeras.com/kenali-dan-kunjungi-objek-wisata-di-pandeglang/">Kenali Dan Kunjungi Objek Wisata Di Pandeglang</a></p>									</div>
