					<p>I have been looking for more information about how to mod this router as i intent to use a few for some solar powered projects but so far i get a mixed feeling about how well these mods work.<br />A friend tried one of these &quot;popular&quot; mods and did not find, it was worthy. <br />Whats the update with your experiences and what is the current recommendation ? Has there been any progress, changes or improvements ?</p>									</div>
