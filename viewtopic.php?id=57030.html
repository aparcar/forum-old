					<p>I have a setup where WAN is a DCHP client through eth0 and LAN serves WiFi through wlan0.<br />Any wireless client of the LAN is a DHCP client of the wireless network.<br />Unfortunately the client uses the LAN default gateway as its DNS server, even though 8.8.8.8 has been defined in OpenWRT.</p><p>If I override the DHCP listing on the client, using &#039;Network Connection&#039; options, the Windows box is now able to resolve.<br />Can anyone explain where I can set 8.8.8.8 to be the preferred DNS option?</p><p>I would like both WAN and LAN to use 8.8.8.8 to resolve DNS if possible.</p><p>I appreciate any assistance.</p>									</div>

					<p>So I&#039;ve been able to fix the DNS resolution on the LAN side by adding dhcp-option=lan,6,8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4&nbsp; to dnsmasq.conf</p><p>Since the WAN or eth0 is a dhcp client of another network, is there anyway to assign it a default dns address?</p><p>Can anyone advise if this is possible?</p>									</div>

					<p>Why are you fighting OpenWrt options?</p><p>Just leave so that wifi clients use DNS from router, that will make your network FASTER!<br />Why? Because router will cache dns queries and answer queries much faster that was. And it it is missing some record it will go to your defined DNS (8.8.8.8) and grab it.</p><p>Don&#039;t fight OpenWrt it has good configuration and if you edit it most likely is that you will make it work less optimal (slower).</p>									</div>

					<p>well if I didn&#039;t fight the default settings, my wifi clients wouldn&#039;t have any internet.</p><p>This is weird and I don&#039;t know why it is acting this way.<br />At home my TL-MR3040 works fine.&nbsp; At work it is not able to resolve DNS.</p><p>My work computer resolves DNS without issue.&nbsp; When I connect the TL-MR3040 to the same network port it can&#039;t resolve.<br />If I try to add packages to this OpenWRT router it can not resolve addresses, neither can wifi clients connected to the LAN side.</p><p>I was able to edit the DNS options of the LAN or &quot;client&quot; side and now they are able to access the internet.<br />The WAN side of this router still can&#039;t update packages.&nbsp; I can only assume the eth0 dhcp client is being assigned bad DNS.</p><p>Since I can&#039;t see what DNS the WAN is being assigned, it is hard for me to diagnosis.<br />Don&#039;t know why ifconfig eth0 doesn&#039;t list DNS.&nbsp; linux makes it much harder sometimes.</p>									</div>

					<p>One option is that maybe network on your WAN side is not providing DNS record, so that could be reason why openwrt doesn&#039;t have dns resolving.</p><p>When troubleshooting you have to begin from the START.</p><p>1. step: check if openwrt resolves DNS queries by logging into it and doing &quot;ping google.com&quot;<br />2. step: check are you clients configures to ask for DNS or do they have static DNS set. Which DNS do they get when in automatics mode?<br />3. step: Can clients resolve DNS? Try pinging &quot;ping google.com&quot;</p><p>Share your /etc/config/network and /etc/config/dhcp config files</p><p>And also read: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/dhcp">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/dhcp</a></p><p>IRC is much suited for these kind of questions, jump in to OpenWrt IRC and you will get replies much faster.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>valentt</strong> on 27 Apr 2015, 10:51)</p>
