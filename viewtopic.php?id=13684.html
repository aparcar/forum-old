					<p>Hello all,</p><p>I am looking to customise the firmware on my DG384Gv2 router - Only 1 small customisation required in that I want to replace the block.htm file with my own file.</p><p>I as it stands have no experience with Linux nor do I curently have access to a Linux box to be able to attempt the build of the custom firmware myself? Would anyone on this forum be willing to create the custom firmware for me if I were to provide them with my custom block.htm file, as it is a minor thing to change in the build?</p><p>I would be extremely grateful.<br />Thanks in Advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think the best place to start would be to get yourself a linux box and compile the image your need. Almost any odd/old beast of a PC would do the job for you, just add Debian and shake together with a few extra packages - then run the build. You could alternatively install a dual-boot setup.</p><p>You seem to now a bit already ;-)</p>									</div>

					<p>the openwrt build system is a LOT easier then the stuff you usually get as a gpl release from the vendor. making one change would be harder then making openwrt do what you want. the dg834v2 is arm and seems like it would be supported according to the list, but i&#039;d ask someone on irc, since there&#039;s no specific page for it.</p>									</div>
