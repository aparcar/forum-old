					<p>Hello,</p><p>as the topic describes, I am new to OpenWRT.<br />I&#039;ve read &quot;About OpenWrt&quot;, &quot;Installing OpenWrt&quot; and &quot;Using OpenWrt the first time&quot; of the OpenWRT wiki page, but I am still not sure, what version i should choose. I use Linksys WRT54GL (v 1.1).</p><p>If I am right, there are 2 different &quot;version&quot; of OpenWET - White Russian (stable?) and Kamikaze (unstable?).</p><p>- But what is the best choice?<br />- What happens if the upgraid fails?<br />- Should i reset the stored data (load defaults) before upgrading to OpenWRT?<br />- And what image do i have to download</p><p>If this is the wrong place for this topic, sorry for that.</p><br /><p>regards,<br />Felix</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>felix</strong> on 10 Sep 2007, 19:23)</p>

					<p>Hi</p><p>I think you have to state what kind of experience you have with linux systems, what are your needs (what is the router going to &quot;do&quot; for you at the present) and what would you like to do in the future?</p><p>In respect to what firmware to select - always look for an image which contains &#039;wrt54g&#039; in the &quot;name&quot;. The &#039;wrt54gl is identical to the older (prior to version 5) models. The &#039;L&#039; does stand for &#039;Linux&#039; (at least that what I suppose it means). </p><p>If you&#039;r mainly used to a &#039;gui&#039; then I would suggest that you take a look at the various guides related to the X-Wrt webif: </p><p><a href="http://wiki.x-wrt.org/index.php/Main_Page">http://wiki.x-wrt.org/index.php/Main_Page</a></p><p>+ there is a basic installation and configuration howto for Kamikaze here:</p><p><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=11451">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=11451</a></p><p>Have fun</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi glp,</p><p>thank you for your reply. I only have experimence on debian systems.</p><p>Requirements:</p><p>- I would like to have access to the internal crontab to manage jobs, which the router should do e.g. once a day.<br />- The Router should be able to run a webserver (maybe lighttpd?) with php5. MySQL is not necessary.<br />- a well arranged router webinterface would be nice too.</p><p>Thats it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Then best use whiterussian.</p><p>The main difference is that whiterussian is the latest stable version which uses the nvram configuration.<br />Kamikaze is the new version but still work in progress but already pretty stable but in all test envirronment a error can occur</p>									</div>
