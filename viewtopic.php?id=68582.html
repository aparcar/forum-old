					<p>I made an Openwrt 12.09 image in Sep 22, 2016, It was fine.</p><p>In Nov 3 2016, I introduced &quot;easycwmp&quot; and some related packages into menuconfig, then a booting info<br />&quot;Nov&nbsp; 4 04:11:09 crond[547]: crond: crond (busybox 1.19.4) started, log level 5&quot; <br />occurred and later booting are stuck. </p><p>So I tried to remove&nbsp; all of newly-added &quot;easycwmp&quot; and some related packages in menuconfig, but the unusual booting info still occurred and later booting are stuck. </p><p>Then I checked \openwrt\.config, \openwrt\build_dir\linux-ar71xx_generic\linux-3.3.8\.config,\openwrt-all\target\linux\ar71xx\config-3.3, and deselected all newly-added packages/libs/modules after Sep 22, 2016, but the unusual booting info still occurred and later booting are stuck. </p><p>Finally I replaced the 3 files of \openwrt\.config, \openwrt\build_dir\linux-ar71xx_generic\linux-3.3.8\.config,\openwrt-all\target\linux\ar71xx\config-3.3 with previous version (before Sep 22, 2016), but the unusual booting info still occurred and later booting are stuck. </p><p>Now my Openwrt 12.09 image in Sep 22, 2016 is unrecoverable! what is going wrong?</p>									</div>
