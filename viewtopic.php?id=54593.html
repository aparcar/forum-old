					<p>I have implemented a multi-user setup for Openwrt/Luci. Not only does it provide multi user access, it also allows the root user to ..</p><p>- add/remove users <br />- select what group the user/s shall belong to<br />- choose whether or not the user/s should have ssh access<br />- choose what parts of the luci ui are available to the user on an individual basis</p><p>This can all be done from the luci ui by the root user <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p> I would like to release it as a luci module but there are a few issues that make adding it or more so removing it as a package difficult to obtain with out inconvenience. The main problem is that there is mods to the dispatcher.lua file, one to allow ALL system users to sign in and another to remove parts of the index from the ctx.tree . I have also moved some menus around in the ui layout (controllers) to accommodate the multi-user setup. So the problems are.. the menus would remain in the order i&#039;ve set for the multi-user setup ...which is not really a big deal. however the major problem is the luci-core and/or the luci-admin-full pkg&#039;s ( which ever one contains the dispatcher.lua file) would need to be removed and then reinstalled because the dispatcher.lua file would be removed with multi-user package.</p><br /><p>I would like to work with the developers on this to improve it a little and incorporate it into openwrt as a maintainable and convenient multi-user pkg for the openwrt/luci systems. The src code is available for those who wish to help</p>									</div>

					<p>bump ..bump&nbsp; I have a multi-user implimentation completed. I can add/remove users from the&nbsp; luci ui as well as set which menus the user can access, ssh permissions ..etc. The users can set their own password without effecting the root password from the ui and never has root access to the device. I would like to make a few improvments to it and possibly ad it as a ipk option for luci. The package no longer has any dependencies and with a few conditional statements added in the dispatcher, index and serviceclt can be added and removed with no negitive effects to the standard luci functionality.</p><p>I also have a pure lua ftp server i would like to possibly add as well, I could really use some constructive critism if Jow or any of the other devs would like to help out.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have added the project to Github, here <a href="https://github.com/Hostle/openwrt-luci-multi-user">https://github.com/Hostle/openwrt-luci-multi-user</a> I only included the files pertaining to the project to make it easier to see what i have done so far. I commented the dispatcher.lua in regards to what i have added, comments are at the top of the file. The changes to servicectl.lua and index lua a pretty evident. It works fine for me, although the code is still a little rudimentary. I think it could be improved allot by utilizing cbi/uci to do allot more, however i am not so familiar with the functions available nor how to use them properly. If nothing else it serves as a great proof of concept, with a little polishing I think it should work pretty good.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hostle19</strong> on 5 Mar 2015, 16:01)</p>

					<p>That error is telling you that the config file for the users module is missing. Just add an empty file &quot;/etc/config/users&quot; and it should work. Its strange that file is missing, you must have got the src before i was finished working on it. You should update the src and rebuild, i fix a few small bugs before i uploaded the complete package and you&#039;ll want the new src. I have added the src to the LuCI src so you can build it just as you would any luci pkg.

					<p>I have added the ability to hide sub menus and fixed the direct url access so that when a menu is hidden it CAN NOT be accessed by using the url directly as suggested in the previous post.

					<p>I have finished and tested the code. As far as I am concerned I have completed a full blown multi-user setup for luci/openwrt.

I think this could easily be pushed to the luci src and become a valuable tool in which the openwrt community could really benefit from. I have my own respo set up were the code can be fetched and built but ultimately I would like to see it become part of the luci repository or at least have the necessary changes made to the luci src to accommodate the multi-user package.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hostle19</strong> on 3 Oct 2015, 04:49)</p>

Necessary in order to avoid some duplication in module paths?</p><p>I also think that the multiuser module might be a luci-application instead of a luci-module. As base files would be edited, the required generic changes (renames , changes to base) would be included already in the default luci, so to me it makes no sense to define this as an alternative to the normal luci. Instead the additional multiuser stuff looks like an add-on application (like statistics, DDNS etc.).</p><p>If you would like to get this included in Luci proper, I suggest that you<br />1) fork a new repo from Luci trunk<br />2) apply the changes in probably three logical commits (renames &amp; related fallout, changes to base, new module) and clearly explain the reasoning in commit messages.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; (and skip the changes of documentation to include links to screenshots etc.)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; (skip also the extensive copyright/comments block in uci-defaults file that quadruples the size of that file)<br />3) create a Pull Request at Luci github</p><p>Using &quot;git diff 4ab6dce . &gt; multi.patch&quot; it should be rather straightforward to create a patch for Luci in order to create the new commits.</p>									</div>

I basically just threw this together for proof of concept, I think if could be improved a lot before actually being implemented into Luci. Also, just this past weekend I decided to make some changes to try and simplify things. The new method has far fewer moving parts and is much less invasive to the luci src. Basically I got rid of most of the modifications to the dispatcher.lua and the need for renaming.I did this by adding simple checks to determine if the user has privileges to use each index entry in the index() function of each controller. </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>\-- Copyright 2008 Steven Barth &lt;steven@midlink.org&gt;

					<p>Ok i have finished the new version, in my opinion its a much better approach. I have added measures to prevent empty main tabs as you mentioned in your post above. I also moved the package to applications and added more accurate and precise comments. I created a new fork of luci from today and added the commits to it. The new fork can be found here --&gt; <a href="https://github.com/Hostle/luci.git">https://github.com/Hostle/luci.git</a></p><p>I think you&#039;ll find it is much cleaner and it should merge much better. There is still a few more things I would like to see before it is fully committed into luci&nbsp; ...</p><p>1. a nicer interface for the &quot;Edit Users&quot; I was thinking of laying it out like the &quot;Interfaces&quot; pages where the current users are listed with buttons to edit or remove them.</p><p>2. the &quot;luci.users&quot; module needs to be optimized and better error checking implemented.</p><p>3. Perhaps deeper permission options for ssh privileges.</p><p>I am sure Jow and the others can whip this into shape pretty quick, I am back in schoool now but I will do my best to contribute what and when I can.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks.
