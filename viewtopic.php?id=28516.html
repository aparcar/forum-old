					<p>Hi, all. I made usb mods for my DIR-615C2/TL-941ND and found that this impacts AR9132 PHY1 stability and perfomance. (PHY1 interface real speed became 16-25Mbit, sometimes even 10-20Kbit). PHY0 interfaces real speed = 100Mbit&nbsp; (vlan1 as wan &lt;--&gt; vlan2 as lan, torrent as traffic generator, iptables/nat, cpu ~80%).</p><p>I examined board of DIR-615 and found that all 5 ports (1 wan + 4 lan) connected to AR8216 6 port switch. I tried to make two vlans: vlan2=&quot;0t 5&quot;, vlan1=&quot;0t 1 2 3 4&quot; but vlan2 doesn&#039;t work <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> </p><p>I just can&#039;t understand how this board works... AR8216 is 6 port switch: 0 - PHY0, 1-4 - lan, 5 - wan. <br />What about PHY1 ??</p><p>This is a photo of the board:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/_detail/toh/d-link/d-link.dir-615c2.pcb.top.side.big.jpg?id=toh%3Ad-link%3Adir-615%3Ac1-photos%3Astart">http://wiki.openwrt.org/_detail/toh/d-l â€¦ os%3Astart</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>regressor</strong> on 7 Feb 2011, 16:03)</p>

					<p>Well, nice photo. Do you happen to have something about the circuitry of the AR9132? Haven&#039;t I read somewhere, I don&#039;t know where, that the USB and PHY are intertwined somehow. I haven&#039;t even known, the AR9132 has a second PHY! And why did you test FastEthernet, is has GBitEthernet! Oh, the Switch is FE only.</p><p>I think you need the layout of the circuitry.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well. I solved these problems. For dir-615 i moved ar71xx_add_device_usb() call before _add_device_eth() calls and problem gone (I don&#039;t know why <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />). For TPlink WR941ND I posted a ticket #8911 (RTL8306S phy driver fixup code writes to switch register).</p><p>Looks like AR8216 can work as switch on first phy and export port0 on second phy (DIR-615C2), but I don&#039;t know if this is a program option. TPLink wr941nd&nbsp; use only&nbsp; phy0 to connect to Marvell 88e6060 switch.</p>									</div>
