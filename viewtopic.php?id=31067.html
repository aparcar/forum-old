					<p>Thank you, flux! <br />Now, a nice enhancement would be to be able to control these options (circular / file / external) through web... I realize, it&#039;s a matter of priorities, and since I don&#039;t know how to code - I shouldn&#039;t opine what&#039;s more or less important <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Actually, it&#039;s probably better to modify /etc/config/system then to mess with /etc/init.d/boot <br />The changes that *are* available end up in /etc/config/system, and I was successful also putting <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;log_type&#039; &#039;file&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;log_file&#039; &#039;/mnt/var/log/messages&#039;<br />that doesn&#039;t have UI way of updating</p>									</div>
