					<p>Hi All, </p><p>I am sure, someone must have explained in past, but I could not figure out from search. Need help on following:</p><p>I want to use uci c interface. I could not figure out where to start. Basically, I have two questions on this:</p><p>1. On NOR-FLASH addr 0xabcd0000, variable cfg_rom_1 is stored as INT &lt;4 bytes&gt;. Through C-interface I would like to read it. </p><p>2. I like to read and write configuration from /etc/config/voltile_config. But using C-interface. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Shell script should be easy one. </p><p>Fundamentally I question may boil down to one : how do we use C-interface. A simple example will do a great favor for me. </p><p>&lt;&lt;Being novice, I must have asked question wrong way: sorry if so&gt;&gt;</p><p>Regards, <br />bharat</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Yanira, </p><p>Thanks a lot for the link.<br />I have done couple of things using this. Still I am not clear about hierarchy of pkg, section, element. *(&amp;More is LIST). <br />Can you please give an idea of this:<br />1+++++++++++++++++++++<br />config ap testconfig<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option number 123<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option string&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;string<br />While reading it reads 123 as string and not number. Simple way is to strtoul. But, is there any elegant way of doing this using uci(map). I think.<br />2++++++++++++++++++++++<br />Can I have array. Like I have an array of IP address. How can I manipulate that using UCI.<br />currently I have done like this....<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option ip1 192.168.1.1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option ip2 192.168.1.1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option ip3 192.168.1.1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option ip4 192.168.1.1<br />I am sure, this is very wrong approach. Can you please suggest something on this. <br />Regards, <br />Bxxt</p>									</div>
