					<p>I have an older Logitech 4000 that uses the pwc driver.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried both the binary blob v.9 driver, and the branched v.10 open source driver.&nbsp; I have a kernel patch for pwc10 if you need it.&nbsp; I also have a brand new Logitech QC IM/Connect that uses the spca5xx driver.&nbsp; I had some issues with the driver compiling; I did some very dirty hacks to get it to work but I still get the same failure.&nbsp; No kernel patch for that one; it&#039;s an ugly mess and I don&#039;t wnat to foist that on anyone yet...</p><p>I had email this AM from the spca maintainer, which may explain what we&#039;re seeing:</p><p>&gt;&gt; your hardware cannot<br />&gt; &gt;support decoding pictures in real times&nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> <br />&gt; &gt;Did you compute what is the bandwith need to decode a 640x480 jpeg picture<br />&gt; &gt; at 15 fp/s ?<br />[snip]<br />it is a zc0301 chips it should be easy to patch the code and get supported. <br />There are an application name spcacat to get picture from the webcam without <br />decompressing the jpeg stream in the spcaview package, so that should work <br />fine with spca5xx-LE and spcacat for your need and a little patch to get your <br />webcam know by the driver&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> </p><br /><br /><p>The problem is also that usb2 support appears to be broken in kamikaze with the 2.4.32 kernel, so I&nbsp; am running at usb 1 speeds....</p><p>So it looks like a) I need to see if usb2 works with the 2.6 kernel, and b) get a decent patch for the spca driver, and c) get spca5xx/LE working for my webcam.</p><p>Fortunately the maintainer seems very responsive....&nbsp; :-)</p><p>--Yan</p>									</div>
