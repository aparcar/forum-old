					<p>I&#039;m in the market for an 802.11ac router to use as an access point, and I notice a few high-end consumer routers on the market that are advertised as &quot;Tri band&quot; AC3200 devices, with 3 radios built in, 1 on the 2.4Ghz band and 2 at 5Ghz. Specific devices I have noted are:</p><p>Netgear R8000 (close to working with OpenWRT)<br />Linksys EA9200<br />ASUS RT-AC3200</p><p>So what I&#039;m really trying to understand is the purpose of having two 5Ghz radios. I&#039;m no wifi expert, but this goes against my previous understanding of the technology. I suspect there is a lot marketing bullshit involved, and a lot of reviews being written by people with little understanding of the technology themselves. I see talk of these routers &quot;Running two networks in the 5Ghz band&quot; and other things that don&#039;t ring true to me.</p><p>So I wonder if any of the knowledgeable people here can tell me - how do these routers use the two 5GHz radios? Is it that they somehow team two 3x3 radios together to create a 6x6 MIMO spacial streams configuration? (I understand the ac standard allows for up to 8) Do they really run two separate networks? Or is there something else beyond my understanding here?</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, I found the second article very informative.</p><p>For my needs, I think I&#039;ll buy an ac1750 router for half the price and wait for the dust to settle on MU-MIMO and XStream.</p>									</div>
