					<p>Running OpenWrt Firmware Attitude Adjustment (r30133) / LuCI Trunk (trunk+svn8218) on a BT Home Hub&nbsp; 2.0B which is a lantiq based system.</p><p>Most things are working fine but am having issues with the wireless.</p><p>Connecting a Windows 7 Dell laptop which has a Dell branded 1501 wireless card to OpenWRT I get a constant stream of errors (see below) and the connection goes slow both compared to other laptops and to the same router with the standard BT firmware. It gets so bad that an internet speedtest is 2M less when done via the Dell laptop and wireless.</p><p>The errors are all the same:-</p><p>kern.err kernel: [xxxx.xxxx] ath: Failed to stop TX DMA, queues=0x004!</p><p>I have seen other references to this type of error but no really suggestions as to how to work out what is wrong and fix it.</p><p>Anyone got any ideas?</p>									</div>
