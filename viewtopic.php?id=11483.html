					<p>I have a big proublem with my Internet Service Provider (ISP).<br />1.First of all my ISP set the ttl of the packages to 1 (TTL=1) so i can not use the same connection on 2 computers.<br />2.Seccond i need to run a&nbsp; aplication under windows to connect to there server so i can have net at home. They also have a linux version of the application: <a href="http://acces.czone.ro/install_linux.html">http://acces.czone.ro/install_linux.html</a> this is the adres where it can be downloaded.</p><p>Now: I want to buy a wrt54gl wifi router and need to modify the TTL (Time to leave) of the packages and also to install there application on the router. Can i do that? How can i do it?<br /> Also to install there aplication under linux the user must&nbsp; install a lot of other packages like &quot;zend&quot; etc. For details about the aplicationclick here <a href="http://acces.czone.ro/install_linux.html">http://acces.czone.ro/install_linux.html</a><br />This aplication sends a ping every 5 minutes to the server to keep alive the connection. If the application is closed, the internet connection is not working anymore</p><p>Can anybody help me pls how to do this?</p><br /><p>I have a proxy server and works fine but i&#039;m tired to keep a desktop computer turned on 24 hour a day just to have net in all the home,</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi badboy1985ro,</p><p>TTL issue is not a big deal, under Linux u can use iptables to modify it, like this for example:<br />iptables -t mangle -I PREROUTING -i ppp0 -j TTL --ttl-set 10</p><p>(Search in I’net modify linux ttl, there is a lot info)</p><p>This C-zone pinging is bad.<br />They use this ZendOptimizer – close source software.<br />So u can try to use PPC or x86 router supported by OpenWRT (supported architectures by ZendOptimizer) </p><p>Or to have some 25-50 USD Linux PC plugged in your LAN to do the pinging it for you.</p><p>U can search in I’net for some reverse engineering or hacking of this C-zone staff.</p><p>Salute</p>									</div>

					<p>PPC in this case stands for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC">PowerPC</a>, it is a processor architecture.&nbsp; There are a few OpenWrt capable boards that run on PPC chips, I can think of the <a href="http://www.magicbox.pl/">MagicBox</a> product line off the top of my head, along with the AMCC dev board (which is probably way to expensive and overpowered for your uses.)</p><p>These won&#039;t help the situation though as OpenWrt is built using uClibc instead of glibc to save space.&nbsp; All the versions of Zend Optimizer linked to from that czone page are built against glibc and are not compatible with OpenWrt.&nbsp; Your best course of action is probably to switch to a different ISP that doesn&#039;t have such a rediculous configuration.&nbsp; If that isn&#039;t an option, then you are going to have to have a PC running, (there are tons of small/old PCs that don&#039;t consume much power compared to modern machines.)</p>									</div>

					<p>OK. Let see if i understand. I can&#039;t install the application zend and all the other packges because i don&#039;t have enought space on the router&#039;s flash? But what if i can install a sd card of 2 GB of ram? i found a tutorial that tells how to do this. What i want to know is: WILL I BE APLE TO INSTALL THE APPLICATION ON A ROUTER USING OPENWRT IF I HAVE ENOUGHT SPACE? I INTEND TO INSTALL A SD CARD OF 2 GB IF THE ROUTER AND THE OPENWRT LINUX WILL ALOW ME TO INTALL THE CZONE APPLICATION.</p><p>wILL THE APPLICATION WORK?</p>									</div>
