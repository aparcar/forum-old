					<p>I want to assign different IP range according to vendor class identifier (option 60) provide by dhcp client. E.g. 192.168.1.10 to 192.168.1.100 for Android phone, 192.168.1.100 to 192.168.1.200 for ios.</p><p>Searched in the forum, seem it is not possible in dnsmasq. </p><p>I installed isc-dhcp-server, but don&#039;t know how to configure it.</p><p>Another question is that when using dnsmasq, the clients use the router&#039;s IP as dns server, e.g. 192.168.1.1. How to implement this in isc-dhcp-server?</p><p>Thanks for help!</p>									</div>
