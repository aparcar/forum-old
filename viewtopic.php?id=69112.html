					<p>I am struggling to pull off a fairly complicated VLAN/switch configuration which depends on configuring a VLAN that is simply used to shuttle traffic to a trunked VLAN port (to support an external layer 2 filtering device)</p><p>I have been stepwise removing/simplifying parts to figure out what wasn&#039;t working and have come down to this basic openwrt configuration that I need to make my project function, but just can&#039;t get it to work.</p><p>Here is what I need to work:</p><p>Port 1 - LAN - vid 1<br />Port 2 - WAN - vid 2<br />Port 3 - Internal - vid 25<br />Port 4 - dumb - vid 50<br />Port 5 - dumb - vid 50</p><p>If vid 50 was functioning as a dumb switch, I would expect to be able to connect a network cable from port 3 to port 4 and then connect a device to port 5 and have the switch transfer packets to vid 25.&nbsp; However, despite trying every possible configuration I could think of, it never passes traffic (DHCP, ping, etc)&nbsp; (Port 3 works just fine if you connect it straight to a NIC)&nbsp; Using swconfig, I have watched the port counters for ports 3 &amp; 4 while connected together and as expected the packet counts are exactly mirroring each other, meaning packets are getting passed from the network device plugged into port 5 to port 3...&nbsp; I just don&#039;t understand why I can&#039;t establish a connection.&nbsp; </p><p>LAN/GUEST are configured as static nets with DHCP.&nbsp; I have tried the &quot;dumb&quot; network with (using proto &#039;none&#039;) and without a &#039;config interface&#039; entry.</p><p>I am running OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05.1, Kernel 3.18.23 on a Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH2 (ar71xx-generic-wzr-hp-g300nh2)<br />The switch uses ag71xx-mdio.0 and has worked for all the other VLAN work I have done, including trunking multiple VLANS to my AP.&nbsp; I just need to insert a layer 2 device and place that as a VLAN on the trunk to the AP.</p><p>Is this something that openwrt just doesn&#039;t support?</p><p>Here is the switch config<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config switch
