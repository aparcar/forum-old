					<p>I&#039;m in Mexico, I have TelMex DSL service, they provide a 2-Wire router, in which I have disabled the<br />router and wireless functions, such that the 2-Wire acts only as a DSL modem. Connected to the 2-Wire<br />is a Ubiquity RouterStation Pro, on which I&#039;ve installed OpenWRT Backfire 10.03, r24064, cross-compiled <br />from source on a Linux PC. In back of the Ubiquiti is my LAN, with several PC&#039;s. The Ubiquiity connects to <br />TelMex using PPPoE. </p><p>Believe it or not, this setup works fine, except for a problem I will describe, which is associated with <br />my occasional need to use an (Open)VPN connection to a VPN service in the USA, which service<br />then provides a proxy so that when accessing the internet I look like I&#039;m in the USA. The (Open)VPN <br />connection also works fine, except as described following.</p><p>The DSL shares my Telmex telephone line. I use a TelMex-provided DSL filter between the TelMex<br />line and the TelMex 2-Wire modem. IF, and ONLY IF, I&#039;m using the (Open)VPN connection and proxy,<br />every time I make or receive a telephone call, I lose my internet connection. If (Open)VPN is NOT<br />in use, telephone calls in or out do not break the internet connection.</p><p>It&#039;s a strange problem, but I&#039;m hoping someone on this list might have an idea what&#039;s wrong and/or<br />how to fix???&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks, Gus</p>									</div>
