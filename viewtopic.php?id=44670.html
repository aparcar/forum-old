					<p>I ask this because today I&#039;ve decided to flash trunk image to WR841ND v.7 that I used for a week in WDS setup with WR741ND and another WR1043ND v.1<br />I flashed this <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr841nd-v7-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ â€¦ pgrade.bin</a> via LUCI web interface. MD5 hash match the one from the repository. <br />I chose to preserve the configuration. After flashing I cannot access the web interface any longer and Wi-Fi is disabled. Only SSH. The network address and the password remained the same as configured previously. Can anyone explain what should I do. Can I reflash a new firmware or reset to default settings via SSH or TFTP. Does the trunk image have LUCI built-in or it has to be installed separately. I cold rebooted via power adapter but it&#039; just the same. Did I brick the router or I just didn&#039;t know how to configure it properly.<br />Please help.</p>									</div>

					<p>I reset the router to default settings. Obviously the trunk doesn&#039;t have Luci built-in. I&#039;ve installed it later. The issue was that with this trunk version the wireless didn&#039;t work. I reverted back to AA 12.09. Can anyone explain how to configure opkg to fetch the packages locally. <br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/opkg">Here</a> I can see this.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Local Repositories
You can configure opkg to fetch the packages locally:
src/gz local file:////path/to/packagesDirectory</code></pre></div><p>So if I am under windows and the files lie on C:\path\to\packagesDirectory how does this line have to look in opkg.conf file.<br />Does it only apply to the router file system.</p><p>I&#039;ve created a ticket <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/13696">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/13696</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sppmaster</strong> on 13 Jun 2013, 16:00)</p>
