					<p>I successfully compiled a firmware for my WDR4300 using the following CFLAGs:<br />-Ofast -march=74kc -mdspr2<br />But I couldn&#039;t prove if this caused a notable improvement in Samba file transfer speeds (which was my goal). I measured higher speeds after the update but these measurements have very bad repeatability.</p><p>So, I just wished to share that using this &quot;ultimate speed&quot; setup is possible in case you use uclibc and you don&#039;t need any software which requires strictly standard floating point math (like SQLitev3 -&gt; which I don&#039;t need but some may do), but you normally get a message about that.<br />And I wanted to add that -fno-caller-saves should be removed and that mtune is redundant if you set march for your CPU - which is theoretically the best ; but you should add the extra instruction sets manually (like dsp).</p><p>I am not sure if mips16 could improve anything but I couldn&#039;t test this with the current toolchain. I guess it requires GCC 4.7.1_final or later (so the current pre-release 4.7.x Linaro compiler won&#039;t do it).</p><p>EDIT: No, updating the compiler didn&#039;t help with -mips16.

					<p>IMO, the different categories of compiler options must be clearly kept, discussed and tested separately, as they control very different aspects of the generated binaries (not just &quot;faster&quot;).</p><br /><p>1. Optimisation levels: -Ox</p><p>For storage space and main memory constrained devices as routers, IMO only -Os makes sense as a general optimisation. </p><p>For individual builds, other optimisation levels may be useful, but the binaries will become larger (some much larger; in FLASH memory, but also in main memory, when executed) and high optimisation levels may result in binaries, which exhibit different run time behavior.</p><br /><p>2. Compiler options, which control specific features: e.g. --fomit-frame-pointer, etc.</p><p>These are frequently discussed and debated controversially in various places.<br />IMHO following the best practices of experienced people (e.g. Linux kernel hackers) and fully understanding, what you are doing (RTFM: gcc&#039;s documentation is good!), is an appropriate approach.</p><br /><p>3. Architectural compiler options: -march and -mtune</p><p>-march tells the compiler, which CPU instruction set it has to use. <br />Binaries generated with instructions the actual CPU does not support, will not run (at least not correctly). <br />OTOH, specific CPU features cannot be used, if the compiler is not told to generate CPU instructions for them.&nbsp; These CPU features are designed to enhance performance vastly in specific corner cases, e.g. a FPU (floating point unit) for operations on floating point numbers, cryptographic accelerators for specific crypto operations and DSP extensions (originally intended for audio and video processing) may be used to accelerate various operations.<br />Note that if binaries compiled with too different -march settings are used together (think of e.g. base image versus downloaded packages), the &quot;calling conventions&quot; may differ, hence the binaries may not work together, even though they are all executable on a specific CPU.</p><p>-mtune controls the scheduling of the CPU instructions, i.e. in which order they are put into a binary. <br />The gains in performance are rather small and when optimising for a specific CPU type, the binaries will run slower on other, compatible CPU types.&nbsp; Thus this comes for free (i.e. no disadvantages) for board specific builds, but is not useful for generic builds.</p><p>The specific options, which may be used for 24K*, 34K*, 74K* and 1074K* MIPS CPUs are discussed in my next posting.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>olf</strong> on 4 Oct 2015, 14:19)</p>

					<p>All variants of the 4K, 24K, 34K, 74K, 1004K and 1074K MIPS CPU cores (and maybe 14K, too, although its brother MicroAptiv uses mips32r3) use mips32r2 as their base instruction set (ISA).&nbsp; Hence all these MIPS CPU cores run fine with binaries compiled with -march=mips32r2.<br />NB: The next generation of MIPS cores, the ProAptiv, InterAptiv and MicroAptiv series uses mips32r3, and the recent generation, the MIPS Series 5 &quot;Warrior(s)&quot; uses mips32r5 (P- and M-series) rsp. mips64r5 (I-series) as their base ISA.&nbsp; IIRC r4 was omitted due to the 4 being seen as an unlucky number in Asia.</p><p>The suffix &quot;f&quot; in the name of a x4K* MIPS core denotes the presence of an optional floating point unit (e.g. 74Kf), which is not particularly useful for routers, i.e. the floating point instructions do not accelerate typical use cases of routers.</p><p>The &quot;MIPS DSP Module&quot; aka &quot;DSP16 ASE&quot; (Application Specific Extension) is an optional instruction set extension (compiler option -mdsp) for 24K and 34K.&nbsp; It is sometimes indicated by an &quot;E&quot; in the name, e.g. 24KEc.<br />The 74K and 1074K seem to always include a &quot;MIPS DSP Module Rev2&quot; (-mdspr2 compiler option) instruction set extension.&nbsp; It seems that binaries compiled for the original MIPS DSP ASE are executable by MIPS cores with the DSPr2 ASE.</p><p>The 4K has the MIPS 16e ASE built in (compiler option -mips16, additionally to e.g. -march=mips32r2 or -march=74kc), it is an option for other mips32r2 cores (e.g. often / always present in 74K, sometimes in 24K).&nbsp; This instruction set extension is aimed at code density (i.e. small size of binaries), not at speed.<br />MicroMIPS is a different, incompatible extension with the same goal built into 14K, MicroAptiv and the M-series. </p><p>34K, 1004K and InterAptiv optionally support the MIPS multi-threading (&quot;MT&quot;; compiler option -mmt) extension, the equivalent to Intel&#039;s &quot;hyperthreading&quot;, exhibiting multiple virtual cores per physical core.<br />IIRC, to use the MIPS multi-threading extension, the Linux kernel has to be configured and compiled with explicit support for it. </p><p>The 1004K and the 1074K are variants of the 34K (!) and the 74K for multi-core designs, which do not differ otherwise from their respective base model. <br />Newer MIPS cores are either multi-core capable (ProAptiv, P-series, I-series) or not, without specifically denoting that in their name.<br />IIRC, to use MIPS multi-cores, the Linux kernel also has to be configured and compiled with explicit support for it. </p><p>NB: The 4K and the 14K seem to lack a proper MMU. </p><br /><p>Consequently, e.g. the compiler may automatically use the &quot;MIPS DSP Extensions Rev 2&quot; instructions in binaries compiled with -march=74kc (or explicitly with -mdspr2), and those will not run on any 24K and 34K CPUs (among many more).</p><p>But as OpenWRT images are created for specific routers models, a mechanism to specify a particular CPU core in the board description to be used for -march and -mtune (plus the ability to set other board specific compiler and kernel options) when compiling the binaries for an image would be very useful for making the OpenWRT binaries faster and often also smaller on the same hardware.<br />Software compiled for a broad range of CPU cores (e.g. post-install downloadable binary packages) have to use the smallest common denominator, which is the bare mips32r2 instruction set for x4K* MIPS cores.<br />WRT the calling conventions, I believe all binaries compiled for any specific mips32r2 core and / or extension(s) are compatible, but have not checked that explicitly for the various extensions (DSP16 ASE, DSPr2 ASE, MT ASE, MIPS 16e ASE etc.).</p><br /><p>WRT -mtune, the implementations of the various MIPS CPU cores differ greatly, hence an optimised instruction scheduling may make some difference:<br />- 4K, 14K, 24K, MicroAptiv and the M-series are little pipelined (typically 5 stages), in-order designs.<br />- 34K, 1004K and InterAptiv are medium pipelined (9 stages), in-order designs, optionally capable of multi-threading.<br />- 74K, 1074K, ProAptiv and the P-Series are deeply pipelined (e.g. 15 stages in 74K / 1074K), out-of-order designs. </p><br /><p>HTH<br />olf</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>olf</strong> on 4 Oct 2015, 14:23)</p>
