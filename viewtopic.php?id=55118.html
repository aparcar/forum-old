					<p>I own a TP-Link TL-WDR4300, specifically bought for OpenWRT (I just used the original firmware during the five minutes it took to install OpenWRT), and could not be happier. Everything works, everything is rock solid; the interface is incomparable to any vendor-made interface I have seen before (and believe me, I have suffered lots of them); it is very intuitive and extremely flexible, yet it works like a clockwork.</p>									</div>

					<p>The two bad problems I encountered with Openwrt are:</p><p>1) when you install a new package there is no preliminary verification if the remaining space on the internal flash memory is enough, neither there is any indication of how many packages will be installed (dependencies), nobody knows how much space it will take ...<br />it is a russian roulette, you will discover if the space is enough only at the end of the process, in case it&#039;s not enough you&#039;ll get the internal flash memory completely filled and the package not installed. This is not acceptable for a serious system. </p><p>2) The bluetooth support is a fake, I tested many routers with different openwrt releases and many bluetooth adapters and I&#039;ve NEVER been able to pair anything, simply bluetooth does not work on Openwrt so please remove that wiki page, someone might be deluded <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>Also there is no ADSL support, we are talking about routers, a router without adsl support is like a man without a leg&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>My point is: <br />if you have an old router you don&#039;t use, it&#039;s ok to play with Openwrt, but if you plan to buy a new hardware to play with it, buy Raspberry (same cost but most powerful) and install a serious linux distribution <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pilovis</strong> on 16 Jan 2015, 15:16)</p>

					<p>Hi, TL-MR3020 worked fine with BB last time I had my hands on it. I buy mostly wr841n v8/v9 and wr1043nd V2 if gigabit/usb is needed. Both models are working perfectly. wr841n V9 has slow wifi with BB, but on CC the wifi throughput is ~100mbit.</p>									</div>

					<p>For those of you in the US (or any other country we can export to) who are interested in buying openwrt compatible routers pre loaded with genuine openwrt, at bargain rates we can supply them. We have been searching Chinese market for such routers and have found a good supplier. It was not an easy task. There are many routers in China which claim to be openwrt routers but instead are using Chinese offshoot of the openwrt with wifi drivers&nbsp; being used in copyright violation. They will not tell you this, nor does the copyright violation matters in China. But if you are deploying solutions based on such routers, dont be surprised if at some time in point the copyright violation comes in your way and your deployed solution. </p><p>Any how, the way it works is we have a company in the US and one in China. You can pay us in the US or in China and we will ship your tested, preloaded openwrt router from China with legal open source drivers. We would like to sell in bulk, but its possible for us to send single units. Pricing will depend upon the quantity you will buy, but overall the pricing is very reasonable for all legal stuff. If anyone is interested, please feel free to contact us for details. </p><p>houstontoca@hotmail.com</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ron</strong> on 16 Jan 2015, 13:22)</p>

Its not that hard&quot;.</p></blockquote></div><p>- Don&#039;t be afraid of learning<br />- &quot;Programming&quot; can be done by kids using LEGO - so sometimes &quot;programming&quot; has nothing to do sth you can only do with a high iq/university etc.</p><p>With that in mind I will try to list some things that can be done with increasing difficulty:</p><p><strong>1) Simple Text writing</strong>: Document stuff. Where ? OpenWrt Wiki<br />After That: Document stuff in package Makefiles (they have description sections) <br />This is important for new developers and that want to search and might not find &quot;obvious&quot; packages. With Linux several solutions are possible (which ftp server to use etc...)</p><p><strong>2) Send in patches correcting trivial issues.</strong><br />see <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/40039">https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/40039</a> ... 40290 - deleting whitespaces (according to coding guidelines) PS: there are other fixes like that<br /><strong>3) Send in patches for updating</strong><br />Many packages can be updated by changing just 2 lines (version number, md5sum) and then &quot;just&quot; testing.<br /><strong>4) Fix some minor build issue. </strong><br />Sometimes a dependency is missing or was forgotten. Disable the feature or add the dependency to the DEPENDS list.<br />Some software requires other software. This is more &quot;project management&quot; - keeping track what your software does / does not do (what you have deactivated when you compile it from source). Maybe some knowledge about &quot;Makefiles&quot; and the generic openwrt building process might be helpful (What is done with which files/programs at each step).<br />Using a compiler (&quot;just type in some text and press enter&quot;) is completely different from knowing how a compiler works <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br /><strong>5) Introduce new packages/Track versions</strong><br />Well those Makefiles almost write themselves. If a package does not build ? If the package is popular maybe somebody already stumbled across the error you are having. Maybe the fix is already integrated in Debian but not in the source package. Most Open Source projects have licenses that should be compatible to use with OpenWrt (debian, buildroot.net,gentoo).<br /><strong>6) fix more elaborate issues</strong><br />You have to look more carefully in build logs. You might have to know a little bit more about the tools (autoconf) and the language (C) in which many programs are written. Beginning here you are carefully might be doing some programming. You disable/enable features already in the source code and you might be able to fix some source code errors because of basic knowledge how C Language and its compiling/&quot;cross compiling&quot; works</p><p>Creating packages from software already available is more like writing &quot;management&quot; files - managing the compiler, copying the files ...</p><p>I dont think that writing text files, where you have to follow some sort of fixed rules (what sections are required, what are optional - how do sections affect outcome) can be called &quot;programming&quot;</p><p>Many times &quot;programming&quot; also follows guidelines (&quot;ISO standards&quot; , Documentation, man pages etc) that are available for anyone who can read them. (always beginning with simple things first - for many cases you dont need to understand the difficult use cases ) - the &quot;hello world&quot; program is quite simple but each language standard requires certain &quot;text&quot; to make it work<br />- see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Hello_world_program_examples">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_He … m_examples</a><br />You can probably see the similarities - Open the &lt;Insert language&gt; standard and search for required things , how to output/print text etc.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zloop</strong> on 16 Jan 2015, 19:41)</p>

					<p>The problem seems to be that people think of OpenWrt as some kind of Debian or Ubuntu, just for routers. That&#039;s certainly not the case. Especially things like LCD or Bluetooth support or completely out of the scope of the core development group, all thats done with those packages in preparation for a release is a compile-only test - the actual packaging and runtime quality is dependent on whoever contributed those packages and how many people use and actually maintain them.</p><p>Also OpenWrt&#039;s emphasis has never been on binary repositories and opkg installable packages, they&#039;re more like a side effect of the build process. It is unrealistic to fit things like graphics or bluetooth stacks on 4 or 8MB of flash memory which are already shared with the OS, the bootloader, eeprom data and a kernel image.</p><p>The best way to fit big things into the router is to make them part of the image, either by compiling or by repacking them.<br />If one claims that this is too hard then we can only say that this is the way it is, there is a reason that &quot;serious&quot; distros do not run on the platforms OpenWrt usually targets. </p><p>As for the RaspberryPi suggestion above: that hardware is totally unsuitable for network routing, the same way an vanilla OpenWrt network distribution is unsuitable for multimedia related appliances.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have used, built and abused routers and openwrt for many years. I have found the support from the volunteers like Jow great. The one thing about openwrt is it can be customized to perform on a router for what is was intended for. Being able to do other things is great and that is the &quot;gravy&quot;. I thank all who contribute to this &quot; embedded system&quot;.</p>									</div>

					<p>For what it&#039;s worth, I have had excellent OpenWrt hardware support using the cheap D-Link DIR-615 C1 router with BB. Absolutely no issues whatsoever. From previous testing, wireless was working great as well. Although in my current setup I have the wireless radios disabled and using simply as a DNS server for filtering in a chain of several OpenWrt routers.</p>									</div>
