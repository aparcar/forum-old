					<p>I definitely need to do a better readme and I&#039;ll get to it soon, but subnet != IP.</p><p>For a single IP you can use IP/32 (192.168.1.101/32). For the range, use online netmask calculators (or this: <a href="https://kthx.at/subnetmask/)">https://kthx.at/subnetmask/)</a> but with /30 you get 4 IPs in the range, with /29 you&#039;ll get 8 and so on.</p><p>So, please try list localsubnet &#039;192.168.1.32/32&#039;</p><p>No, nothing should come up in the logs, if you wish to check vpnbypass rules took, you can run iptables-save | grep &quot;vpnbypass&quot; and you should see the iptables rules corresponding to the vpnbypass settings.</p><p>However you run openvpn (from uci, from a conf linked from uci or from an ovpn file) should not affect vpnbypass. The code you quoted has to do with the vpnbypass settings (which you set thru the Services/VPN Bypass), not the openvpn settings.</p><p>Good luck!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stangri</strong> on 2 Feb 2017, 14:58)</p>

Indeed I installed policy-routing with just dnsmasq &amp; then ran into a problem when I tried a domain rule (dnsmasq started crashing). However, I could fix this by removing the rule from the dnsmasq config.</p><p>Now I&#039;m wondering: should I expect any troubles when upgrading from dnsmasq to dnsmasq-full? I would really like to use policy-routing in all its beauty.</p><p>I am also wondering how the dns server is managed. Right now I&#039;ve got a script which is run after succesful OpenVPN connect to put the VPN dns server into the resolv.conf.auto. (Because it is not done automatically by the OpenVPN client.)<br />If I were now to try multiple vpn tunnels (or just a rule for lan-&gt;wan, bypassing the vpn altogether) using policy routing I don&#039;t understand how these different dns servers would be managed using the resolv.conf.auto. Would you be able to shed some light into this?</p><p>Please excuse me if I&#039;m hijacking your thread, I am still pretty new to OpenWRT/LEDE and I am trying to get my head wrapped a few things. Thank you for your helpful answers!</p><p>EDIT: Just saw you&#039;ve a different thread on here for policy-routing, will post there from now on.

					<p>If you have questions relevant to OPR, then please post in the OPR thread. You might get help from other users there as well. With a few very notable exceptions a lot of devs/gurus have migrated to LEDE forum as well.</p><p>PS. If you only have a handful of domain names and/or are not using dnsmasq for name resolution, OPR has built-in support for domain name-based policies.</p>									</div>
