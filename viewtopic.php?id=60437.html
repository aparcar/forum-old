					<p>Hello all,</p><p>From LuCI &gt; Network &gt; Diagnostics, I am not able to ping any external addresses, both urls and actual IP addresses. Local LAN pings are working.

Weird thing is that devices behind Router B can get internet access, LAN access and are able to resolve DNS requests just fine, but Router B itself doesn&#039;t seem to be able too.</p><p>Any input is appreciated!</p><p>~~~~~</p><h5><span style="color: #FF0000"><strong>[SOLVED] Edit:</strong></span></h5><p>For the benefit of others, you need to check two things.</p><p><strong>1) IPv4 Gateway</strong><br />LuCI &gt; Network &gt; Interface &gt; Edit &gt; IPv4 gateway</p><p><strong>2) DNS forwardings</strong><br />LuCI &gt; Network &gt; DHCP and DNS &gt; DNS forwardings</p><p>Set both to point to the IP address of your main router and you&#039;re set!

					<p>I wouldn&#039;t be the person who can help you with that, but I believe that if you posted your relevant configs (network, dhcp and probably firewall), it would greatly help those who can.</p>									</div>
