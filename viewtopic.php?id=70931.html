					<p>Hi there, I have WRT1900AC router with firmware OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05.1</p><p>I started using this router yesterday (due to suspecting my previous router of dropping connection) and everything worked, even connecting via VNC viewer to another PC on LAN (the PC has broken display but otherwise works).</p><p>Today when booted up the router and the PCs, I found the VNC viewer will not connect to the VNC server on the LAN PC (with that broken display), after a while it pops up a message &quot;Timed out waiting for a response from the host computer&quot;. <br />I can connect in via TeamViewer just fine and check on the VNC server on the PC but it is all fine there.</p><p>I suppose it must be the router, that is OpenWRT firewall which is blocking VNC server from responding to VNC viewer request for connection?</p><p>I tried making a firewall rule:</p><p>VNC Server <br />Any traffic<br />From any host in lan<br />To any host in lan&nbsp; </p><p>But that didn&#039;t help. What bugs me is why would it work on the first day and then stop.</p><p>Maybe related thing, when I booted the router the first day and made it to pickup IP from my ISP, I found not long after that DHCP Leases were showed as &#039;expired&#039; (Status-Overview), I checked and the lease time was set some short time, I think maybe 12minutes, I changed that to 24h and after some reboots it caught on and everything was OK, till today when I can&#039;t connect via VNC to that PC on LAN</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vanDivX</strong> on 16 May 2017, 20:00)</p>

					<p>LAN to LAN traffic goes through the internal switch in the device, it does not even reach the CPU, and it is very unlikely that OpenWRT could be interfering with it.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK thank you, even pointer like that is useful. I am somewhere between experts and laymen. I will retest today with the previous router and take it from there.<br />BTW this shows the importance of having second escape path, I always install both TViewer and VNC in case one fails.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vanDivX</strong> on 17 May 2017, 12:25)</p>
