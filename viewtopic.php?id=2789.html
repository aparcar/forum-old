But since iptables rules are read in a top down manner, the chance that the second rule there is ever invoked is slim&#039;n&#039;none.<br />So your load balancing would consist of masquerading different services to different connections, instead of just round robin.</p>									</div>

					<p>This would probably fail because the &quot;ip route equalize&quot; is done on the network layer and not on the session layer. Because of masquerade your source ip adres will be translated into two different ip&#039;s. Two source adresses per session don&#039;t work. </p><p>Because of the connection oriented properties of TCP you will get a lot of resends. Your session will probably stay active/alive, but with lots of resends resulting in even a slower connection experience.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>chankster wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Well, adding another route shouldn&#039;t be a problem.

So routing takes decision where to send packets, not the iptables rules. Above mentioned rules only apply masquerade. But you are still right stating that routing to multiple ISP&#039;s with masquerade should be done based on sessions.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Adze</strong> on 2 Oct 2005, 14:44)</p>

You need iproute2 (where the above mentioned &#039;ip&#039; comes from) to manage this.<br />Using just the ip tool you can make sure one machine always uses one connection. That&#039;s called source-routing. But that&#039;s kind of crude in this kind of situation. You want to route based on sessions.<br />The way it works is that you can use netfilter (iptables) to mark packets, and then route depending on marks. See chapter 11 in the &quot;Advanced Routing &amp; Traffic Control&quot; Howto (use teh google, luke).</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the feedback guys. I really would like to get this to work as I have 3 connections I would like to balance, and a 4-WAN router is very pricy.

					<p>Well if you can remember to set Boot_Wait on before you flash to openWRT. If you&#039;ve already got the hardware then in the end you might as well try since the worst outcome prolly means flashing back to the linksys firmware. No harm in trying I guess. Boot_wait is handy to reflash if something goes wrong though.</p>									</div>

Deciding which services and computers will use is another thing. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />And in case it wasn&#039;t obvious, true transparent load balancing can only be done if the provider supports it, which requires the same provider and rarely then for home users.</p>									</div>

					<p>I finally ditched the effort and got a hotbrick LB-2 off ebay cheap. It works like a charm. Oh well... maybe with a little more time, tinkering, and writing some custom load balancing code I might try to get my WRT to load balance more connections. I&#039;ve kind of been peeling through some of the linksys GPL code for their multi-wan routers, but there&#039;s a lot to look through.</p>									</div>

					<p>I wonder how the load balancing is done using hotbrick LB-2? <br />It would be nice to crack this using WRT54G. Cheapest LB-2 goes for ~$200 and wrt54g goes for $49. That sure sounds good. I&#039;d love to hear comments from folks who have implemented the load balancing + QoS using WRT54g.</p>									</div>
