					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a TP-LINK TL-WR1043ND V2.</p><p>I tried after flashing to restore settings from OpenWRT and now i can&#039;t reach my router anymore. </p><p>I&#039;ve tried everything, failsafe, 30/30/30, even serial flashing with a USB to TTL device but all with no luck. Router seems to be totally broken. With serial flashing it seems that router is not booting up completely.</p><p>When i open a command prompt and do ipconfig there is no gateway present. Computer interface says &quot;unknown network&quot;. Even when i try a static ip adress on my interface there is no gateway assigned. Also i noticed the computer interface is taking a while to detect a network when i directly connect the router. Strange thing is that the system led is flashing regulary, like when the original TPLink software is installed. Regulary flashing means ok.<br />Is this router ready for the garbage bin or is there something else i can do ??</p><p>Thank you</p>									</div>
