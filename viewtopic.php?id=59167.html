					<p>I just flashed to chaos calmer and everything is running great except for my 5ghz radio and sqm scripts. My connection is rated at 180/12 and speeds with streamboost are 170/11.50 and with sqm down was 100-130. Streamboost bufferbloat is ~20ms and sqm/qos is ~5-15, while the lower latency is great I lose a ton of bandwidth. Can someone help me out with getting everything working correctly?</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# tc -d qdisc

					<p>Well, it looks like you are running against your router&#039;s compute wall. Software traffic shaping as performed by sqm and qos is quite demanding cpu eise and most router&#039;s do not pack enough punch to shape at the rates yours requires. Some people report some success with specifying larger bandwidth in sqm, but I never understood why/how that should help. It seems that the Linksys wrt1900ac v2 and wrt1200ac might be powerful enough to shape your line. Also in case you build your own openwrt firmwares you might want to try the new shaper called cake which promises to be more efficient than HTB, and if your firmware supplies the cake qdisc, sqm will allow you to select it...</p><p>Best Regards<br/>M.</p>									</div>

Looking at your speedtest, this is what I assume happened (or in other words no effective sqm). Could you post the result of &quot;tc -d qdisc&quot; after selecting layer_cake.qos and pressing &quot;save&amp;apply&quot;. For layer_cake to work your kernel requires the currently out-of-mainline cake kernel module, which is not part of standard openwrt builds, so unless you build you own and included cake the module will be missing. See <a href="http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/codel/wiki/Cake">http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/codel/wiki/Cake</a> for how to build include cake in your firmware. I do doubt that cake will allow the roughly 170 Mbps cumulative traffic shaping your link probably requires, but then the proof is in the pudding. (In case you actually test cake on your link I would be interested to learn how it performs. I can heartily recommend <a href="http://www.flent.org/">www.flent.org</a> and especially the RRUL test to check whether a shaper works as intended.)<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One thing you could do, given that your downlink is relatively bufferbloat free is too only set up sqm for the uplink (you do this by specifying 0 as the downlink bandwidth, a bandwidth of zero denotes no traffic shaping in that direction to sqm as a shaper set to zero would otherwise disable all TCP traffic).</p><br/><p>Best Regards<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;M.</p><p>(Note moeller0 = moeller01)</p>									</div>

What is missing are the lines for the ingress and egress interfaces showing cake instead of fq_codel. Newer versions of sqm-scripts will try to hide unavailable qdiscs so if cake can not be selected it will not work. Sqm still does not hide *.qos scripts though, so we need to think about what to do there... If only we had a modal dialog in the GUI to inform users with, but alas all we have is pretty subtle...</p><p>Best Regards<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;M.</p>									</div>
