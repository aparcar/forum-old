					<p>I give up Open vSwitch!</p><p>Today I just finished build a new firmware but this time with CPqD OpenFlow switch from here <a href="https://github.com/CPqD/ofsoftswitch13">https://github.com/CPqD/ofsoftswitch13</a>. It&#039;s smaller than Open vSwitch with support for only OpenFlow 13. Since its smaller i could keep the wifi packges.</p>									</div>

					<p>It looks like both of these (Open vSwitch and CPqD openflow-openwrt) have their on set of problems. Both each i do not have any solutions yet.</p><p>Now i will move away from the most recent build of openwrt and try the 14 an 12 versions.</p><p>byw you have to use the OpenWRT 15.05 to be able to install (by opk) or compile Open vSwitch. You will also have to edit the START priority of /etc/init.d/openvswitch to 99 to make it start right. Just be sure to disable the service with </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/etc/init.d/openvswitch disable</code></pre></div><p> before you edit it and enable it back with </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/etc/init.d/openvswitch enable</code></pre></div><p> then a simpel reboot will do the trick.</p><p>But if you feel fancy (or have a router with only 4MB of flash) you can simple use CPqD openflow-openwrt. I made a fork (<a href="https://github.com/lassade/openflow-openwrt">https://github.com/lassade/openflow-openwrt</a>) with my patches so you will be able to run it out of the box following the common install instructions but you will find a hard time putting it to work with RYU, OpenDayLigth or FloodLigth.</p><p>I will post more here my own blog inside the openwrt forum.</p>									</div>

					<p>Today I put my hands on a WR1043 and by following this tutrial <a href="http://ljdelight.com/turning-tp-link-wr1043ndv2-1-router-into-openflow-enabled-switch/">http://ljdelight.com/turning-tp-link-wr â€¦ ed-switch/</a> I was able to setup openvswtich, but with some changes:</p><p>1. To keep ssh working you need to set some interface with a ip address, in this case eth0 (WAN port):<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># if u use this name u get a free dhcp for your controller!
# check dhcp settings at /etc/config/dhcp and see why.
# change the ovs bridge name if u keep this name here!
config interface &#039;lan&#039;
 option ifname &#039;eth0&#039;
 option force_link &#039;1&#039;
 option type &#039;bridge&#039;
 option proto &#039;static&#039;
 # random ip set as you like but be sure to keep this in the same subnetwork of your controller
 option ipaddr &#039;10.10.10.1&#039;
 option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;</code></pre></div><p>2. Set the switch to secure mode, by default ovs will handle packets by himself after 3 failed attempts to connect with some controller.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ovs-vsctl set-fail-mode [BRIDGE_NAME] secure</code></pre></div><p>3. You don&#039;t need a DHCP server for your hosts, just set all ips by youself if you don&#039;t have o bunch of computers lying around.</p><p>This is all that i remember.<br />Let me know if you have any trouble following these instructions.</p><p>Since i know OVS is the way to go i will give another shot in my WR741ND.</p>									</div>
