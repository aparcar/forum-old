					<p>I&#039;ve experimented further. I have to say that, for me, even BB&#039;s USB support is *not* rock solid, although if I hadn&#039;t had my suspicions aroused it&#039;s possible I would never have noticed.</p><p>I wondered if my &#039;dd&#039;-based tests were in some way unfair - although it seemed and still seems a reasonable test to me. So I took a USB stick with a VFAT filesystem on and left BB doing a repeated cp of a big-ish directory overnight. It worked about 40 times and then the usual problem hit:</p><p>[ 3319.460000] usb 1-1: reset high-speed USB device number 2 using ifxusb_hcd<br />[ 3334.636000] usb 1-1: device descriptor read/64, error -150<br />[ 3349.916000] usb 1-1: device descriptor read/64, error -150</p><p>So I don&#039;t think the fact I&#039;m testing with dd is why I see failures. Maybe my hardware (the router or both of the USB sticks) are in some way marginal.</p><p>I&#039;d be interested if anyone running BB (or any other release, for that matter) who has a spare USB stick - this test will destroy any data on it, and will also incur some &quot;wear&quot; on the stick, but probably not much - could try this:</p><p>for x in `seq 100`; do echo $x; time dd bs=1024 count=65535 if=/dev/zero of=/dev/XXX; done</p><p>(Replace XXX with the device name shown in dmesg when you insert the stick; probably sda1.)</p><p>I had never had this complete the full 100 times without hitting the reset problem, on&nbsp; BB or CC, until...</p><p>I found this patch series: <a href="https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/2015-August/035295.html">https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/ope … 35295.html</a> This enables the dwc2 USB driver on the AR9 hardware used in the DGN3500, so we don&#039;t have to use the ifxusb_hcd driver. I&#039;ve applied this to a local copy of the CC branch and built it:</p><p>root@OpenWrt:~# uname -a<br />Linux OpenWrt 3.18.23 #3 Sat Nov 7 23:09:29 GMT 2015 mips GNU/Linux<br />root@OpenWrt:~# dmesg|grep -i usb<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 0.212000] usbcore: registered new interface driver usbfs<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 0.216000] usbcore: registered new interface driver hub<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 0.220000] usbcore: registered new device driver usb<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;40.652000] dwc2 1e101000.ifxhcd: new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 1<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;40.668000] hub 1-0:1.0: USB hub found</p><p>I&#039;m sure I will experience a failure this instant I post this message :-), but this has - for the first time ever on my hardware with either BB or CC - survived the full 100 loops of the test above. My sincere thanks to Antti Seppälä for this patch, which may very well have saved my sanity!</p><p>It looks to me as though this change has been applied to trunk (changesets 46913-46916), so presumably the next release will have it by default. It would be nice if it could be included in a subsequent release of CC, but I don&#039;t know if that is likely to happen.</p><p>Cheers.</p><p>Steve</p>									</div>

You probably want to select the DWC2 driver, this may appear under the kernel usb and/or modules config in make menuconfig, perhaps as &quot;designware 2 host controller&quot; or something like that (this is from memory, so sorry I can&#039;t be precise). You may want to disable the ifx USB support from the build or at least not install those packages so they&#039;re not used by mistake. You can see which driver you are using using lsmod/dmesg - see my posts above for examples of the output.</p><p>I&#039;d be very interested to know if it works for you, I have had no luck even with the DWC2 driver but perhaps my hardware is faulty.</p>									</div>
