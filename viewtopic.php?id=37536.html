					<p>Hi,</p><p>I would like to set up my most unusual network configuration yet.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t yet purchased hardware for OpenWRT and I&#039;d like your advice before I do to know if this is even possible.</p><p>I have two houses, each one with a LAN and a WAN connection:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>House 1<br />LAN<br />ADSL WAN</p><p>House 2<br />LAN<br />cable WAN</p></blockquote></div><p>The two house LANs are connected by a wireless bridge via TP-LINK CPEs (TL-WA5210G).</p><p>I would like to set up my network so that if one WAN connection goes down, BOTH house LANs will automatically fail-over to the other one.&nbsp; I&#039;d also like it so that when both WAN connections are up, BOTH house LANs will load balance between the two WANs.</p><p>I&#039;m guessing that I&#039;ll need one OpenWRT box in each house with a WAN port connected to an ISP, a LAN port connected to the LAN, and then a third port (called what?) connected to the CPE which will act as both a LAN and a WAN port simultaneously somehow.</p><p>Am I insane?&nbsp; :-)</p><p>Thanks,<br />Zaphod</p>									</div>

					<p>I have the same setup, mwan2 can do this for you. I can help you with setup if you like.</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=33129">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=33129</a></p><p>One way to tackle it is to use one OpenWrt router with two wan&#039;s and two lan&#039;s. This is the easy way.</p><p>Another option would be two OpenWrt routers on each location with one wan on each router. Create a trunk between both routers, with 3 vlan&#039;s (one for synchronization and routing of wan traffic and one for each lan). In this last setup you can even connect on your &quot;own&quot; lan on the other router.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Adze</strong> on 16 Jun 2012, 14:04)</p>
