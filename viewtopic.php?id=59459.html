					<p>I found this thread while trying to do something similar. Here&#039;s how I got the lease time.</p><p>You&#039;re correct that udhcpc has the keys to the castle. udhcpc keeps the lease time to himself mostly, except for when he calls the connect script. The location of this script is CONFIG_UDHCPC_DEFAULT_SCRIPT, unless it is provided as a command line argument. </p><p>netifd provides a command line argument: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>$ ps -w
13981 root      1532 S    udhcpc -p /var/run/udhcpc-eth2.pid -s /lib/netifd/dhcp.script -f -t 0 -i eth2 -C</code></pre></div><p>A quick peek at&nbsp; /lib/netifd/dhcp.script shows that he tries to run /etc/udhcpc.user if it exists.(Other dhcp.script files seem to also try to run the user dhcp script.)</p><p>So, you can make your own /etc/udhcpc.user script, and use &#039;set&#039; to see what udhcp provides to you. One variable is &quot;lease&quot; which includes the lease time. Because this script runs when the lease is first delivered, you can simply record the lease time (divided by 2 if you want effective lease time) and the current timestamp to get remaining lease time.</p><p>I&#039;m on AA, so ymmv. Hope this helps though!</p>									</div>
