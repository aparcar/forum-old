					<p>Hi,</p><p>I use a GLI router as a repeater (wireless bridge) and I wanted to make it really simple to use for my wife.</p><p>I was wondering if it would be possible to use nodogsplash to display an &#039;internet is offline&#039; page when no internet connection is detected or the repeated STA is out of range. This page would have a link to the GUI provided by GLI to enable redirection (rather than manually going to 192.168... to check status)?</p><p>Does anyone know if / how this can be achieved <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pm92</strong> on 13 Apr 2016, 16:42)</p>
