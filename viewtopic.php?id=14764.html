					<p>I&#039;d like content filtering to block category web sites like porn, hacking, gambling etc. Keywords would be nice as well. Like dansguardian? I&#039;d also like av for web security and ftp, email etc. like clamav i think? I&#039;d also like to know how much bandwidth has been used for like day, week, month and year/total. Wireless would be necessary and Xbox 360 Live compatible and PS3 network compatible. Also upnp would be nice as well. I also would like the router to either have a hard drive built in or usb capable because I want to run torrentfluxb4rt or similar in the router.</p><p>Is any of this possible with openwrt and what would be a good router for this?<br />thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>ciscostu, no help at all dude.<br />Also I don&#039;t know why in the world you mentioned anything in the last post. I never said I want to run openwrt on my pc as an os, so you should not have assumed that. I know it&#039;s router type software which is exactly why I said I wish I could run it on my pc, but it&#039;s not made for the pc. </p><p>The hardware list helps me not either. It&#039;s useless really for people wanting to know good info etc on certain stuff.</p>									</div>

					<p>If it&#039;s too low end for you, you need to get a PC instead of a router, for example one of intels GLY mini itx boards, then you&#039;ll have like 1Ghz 1GB RAM and can put Debian or something on it. The Asus WL-500-GP (not -V2) is high end for OpenWRT standards, most devices have only half flash / ram of the ASUS. It&#039;s okay for routing, QoS, firewall, simple downloads, etc, but the kind of filtering you want to do may indeed require something with more horsepower.</p>									</div>
