I know that people here tend to be a bit opposed to giving specific router recommendations, after all once you get familiar with OpenWRT you can often wisely choose a router which meets your exact needs, BUT not having at least a list of a few of the most popular, currently available, routers is perhaps the single biggest obstacle to new users. It doesn&#039;t need to be just one router but we really should have a couple router recommendations for &quot;getting started with OpenWRT&quot; ideally at a few different pricepoints.</p><p>What this would really allow is for those of us who want to write &quot;getting started&quot; documentation a platform to work from. I would love to create some getting started videos that started from installing OpenWRT over the factory image and moved on to exploring LuCI, setting up common rules/settings and even into guest networks with VLANs. The problem is that different router models with different features (different types of wireless, different switch lan/wan/cpu port mapping) make this a nightmare without a suggested model and it becomes too complex for a beginner to follow.</p><p>On a related note, for more advanced OpenWRT users who have some idea of what features they want in their router, it would be nice to know what routers are currently widely available and which ones are popular among other users. Ideally some of this information could be collected through a router &quot;popularity-contest&quot; (for those familiar with the Debian popularity-contest package) which could automatically collect some of this data for us. The way it would work is that users, upon first login to LuCI or CLI, would be asked if it is OK for the router to send back to OpenWRT information about the router model and features configured. If the user agreed, and I think many would, we could collect a lot of useful information about what router models are most popular, how many people are using VLANs, etc. which could aid substantially in development and documentation work. Just a thought.</p></blockquote></div><p>Agree with everything here!</p>									</div>

It&#039;s important because:</p><p>- It keeps new developers coming to OpenWrt. Nobody wants to learn how to develop for a backwater project. (This is certainly true for me, if I&#039;m gonna make the effort to contribute, I want people to know and benefit from my work, now and for a long time to come.)</p><p>- It exploits the &quot;bazaar&quot; (of the Cathedral and the Bazaar) by enticing lots of people to pay attention to OpenWrt. Most will install and go happily on their way. A few will do a little development work. But some will become sufficiently intrigued to develop a new, wacky and immensely powerful/wonderful feature that never existed.</p><p>- It&#039;s critical to keep that funnel (user -&gt; developer -&gt; genius/wacky feature) wide open at the front end, so that we have enough people to make the transitions to each of those stages.</p><p>- It is rewarding to see OpenWrt mentioned in the wider world. (And it hurts to see other, less capable, projects touted as the best &quot;Alternate Firmware&quot; to the vendor&#039;s stock.) This is especially so when you see comments like, &quot;XXX firmware kinda sucks, but it&#039;s better than stock, and was an easy install...&quot;</p><p>- There&#039;s a pride in sharing our work: &quot;Hey, try out this firmware on your shiny new XXX router! I just bought one, and OpenWrt works great on it. And I&#039;ll show you how to get it going!&quot;</p><p>- And a ton more reasons...</p><p>&quot;More Users&quot; isn&#039;t, in itself, a critical measure. Whether we had 100 or 105 people check it out in a week/month isn&#039;t inherently important. </p><p>But that number is a proxy for participation. Like that proverbial shark, if OpenWrt isn&#039;t moving forward, it&#039;s dying.</p>									</div>

Here&#039;s why:</p><p>- It means that we could never post a long duration link to the &quot;latest&quot; firmware - any link would go to a single version, which could be different from day to day for an active project.</p><p>- We might solve this with a symlink to &quot;latest&quot;. But then people would wind up with several (or a few dozen) images in their Downloads folder. Then they wonder, &quot;Which of these is actually installed?&quot;</p><p>- It&#039;s easy enough (and definitive) to go to the Web GUI or SSH in to get the version that&#039;s actually running.</p><p>- As @drawz says, No one reports their version number, anyway.
