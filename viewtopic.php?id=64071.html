					<p>Yes, this is the 32MB version and with what I have installed on it, I still have 14M left on the device for other stuff.<br />I read that (as seems to be the case too often) it&#039;s kind of a hit and miss with these, you don&#039;t know for sure what you&#039;ll be getting.</p><p>Yes, I do remove kmod-ath9k and uboot-envtools when building.

I was thinking I could simply put a file on the device when building it that contains the SSID/password since I&#039;ll know those in advance.</p><p>Maybe the wireless client can just use that file to connect to the local wifi.</p>									</div>

					<p>Wait, do you mean yours got messed up when you tried converting it to openwrt?<br />Yes, I&#039;ve tried all kinds of reset things but none have worked.

					<p>That&#039;s interesting. All I&#039;ve done so far is use a factory build then my own.

					<p>So, something interesting.</p><p>I thought I would try another one of these from another seller so bought this one.</p><p><a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/281997162911?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&amp;var=580954562236&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT">http://www.ebay.com/itm/281997162911?_t … EBIDX%3AIT</a></p><p>This one came with a Qualcomm web interface. Wiki notes say you can brick it if you try to upgrade it directly. </p><p><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/unbranded/a5-v11">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/unbranded/a5-v11</a></p><p>I can telnet into it and it is running busybox but not openwrt. No commands to convert firmware from the CLI either.<br />Glad I didn&#039;t order more than one. Still reading the wiki.</p><p>Now I understand why you were messing with the boot loader RoutyMcRouter. Pretty frustrating that these things cannot be consistent.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>projects</strong> on 7 May 2016, 17:48)</p>
