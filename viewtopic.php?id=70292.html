					<p>On a Linksys WRT-3200ACM router, I went with davidc502&#039;s firmware known as LEDE.&nbsp; The file is lede_mvebu_linksys-wrt3200acm-squashfs-factory.img.&nbsp; I am also running openVPN on this router as well.&nbsp; For the past few weeks, the wireless networks stop accepting clients (AC and N).&nbsp; The SSIDs can be seen by all wireless clients, but cannot be connected to as it results in an error on the wireless client attempting to make a connection.&nbsp; All wired clients have no issues at all and are able to maintain connectivity to the router, local (wired) network resources, and the&nbsp; Internet.&nbsp; Is anyone else having this issue?&nbsp; My only work-aroud is to reboot the router, but I shouldn&#039;t have to to do this on a routine basis.</p>									</div>

					<p>This is a known problem, right now it is NOT Recommended to install LEDE, OpenWrt or DD-Wrt on the Linksys Wrt3200ACM, because the Wifi driver is broken, it is being developed right now.</p><p>You can check the development status here: <a href="https://github.com/kaloz/mwlwifi/issues/118#issuecomment-287641259">https://github.com/kaloz/mwlwifi/issues â€¦ -287641259</a><br />Hopefully here have a more stable Wifi driver for the WRT3200ACM by the end of the month... I&#039;m also waiting for this.</p>									</div>

For now is the most stable for Wifi, or if you have another wifi AP (for example the one provided with the ISP), run the Linksys with LEDE for routing the Internet traffic with advanced features and wired connections, and the other Wifi AP for Wireless devices.</p>									</div>
