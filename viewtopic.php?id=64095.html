					<p>My friend as i can read your demand is hard limiting the speed or every device connected to router if yes BIG NO you cant hard limit the device just priority because even im looking for same thing since 3 months never find this option so im looking to install GARGOYLE Firmware with my another new router which got everything we need OpenWrt need to work more for easy implementation use.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>mwaluce wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>thx dude, there is i was trying to say, Interface <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />sry my bad english!</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>hnyman wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>You should try &quot;sqm-scripts&quot; package.

It might well be that what you require is outside of the scope of sqm-scripts, but maybe we can get an approximate solution. So first please describe what you really want to achieve with traffic control. What is the traffic pattern that causes you sufficient &quot;pain&quot; that you want it fixed?</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>

(But man tc can be your friend). If you actually have slightly less stringent requirements and are more interested in a reasonably fair shared network, both qos-scripts and sqm-scripts get pretty close to &quot;good enough&quot; for a lot of users.<br />For example &quot;hard limiting the speed of every device connected to a router&quot; both qos and sqm scripts perform flawlessly (AFAICT) as long as you are happy with limiting the aggregate bandwidth of all devices; both do NOT allow to limit each deice individually. It turns out that for many users flow separation and aggregate bandwidth control work well enough, but unfortunately it just does not work well enough for everybody. </p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>
