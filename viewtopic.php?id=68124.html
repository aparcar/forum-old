					<p>While compiling openWRT for RPi 3 with default settings and no packages there are no errors.<br />Everything works and can be installed on the SD-Card. Boots and works.</p><p>But when adding packages, most work.<br />Some however won&#039;t compile but error instead.</p><p>And a package named hamlib, even if deselected, is automatically always selected but errors.. because of dependencies.</p><p>unless you disable everything. </p><p>so clearly there are a few bugs. Most works, but some packages will error.</p><p>where is the wiki, if not how, to post proper bug reports about this? Or packages that error on compilation aren&#039;t considered bugs? I rather ask first before posting anything.</p><p>In dd-wrt forums you&#039;ll be shot when asking something they don&#039;t like, or post somewhere wrong a bug report. So I hate to avoid that here because I don&#039;t want the Gestapo in my neck <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
