					<p>I had a WGT634U with a USB 2.0 HUB with HD, two printers and bluetooth running for about two years, until 2008/08 when I switched to an ALIX2C3.<br />Is the hub actively powered? Maybe one of your USB cable is faulty?</p>									</div>

The hub needs to be powered, especially for HDD or older USB Sticks. You need a hub with it&#039;s own power cord. The 5 volts over USB isn&#039;t enough for alot of devices.</p>									</div>

					<p>actually I only have one device (HDD) connect to the HUB, I think power shoud from the WGT634U should be enough because I have hacked the router&#039;s hardware by combine the two way USB power to router&#039;s USB port, and I could use the HDD pretty well when it&#039;s directly plug into the router&#039;s USB port. I could also use the HUB plus HDD in WIN XP.</p><p>BTW The HUB did not have its own power cord.</p>									</div>

If you had done the <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=14082">mod</a> to your WGT634U, I believe you will probably need to replace its original AC/DC adapter with a higher Amps throughput. Otherwise, the original AC/DC adapter will only be able to deliver up to 1A current even though the mod works.</p>									</div>

					<p>So, I currently have a USB-audio dongle (C-Media) on my WGT634U, and it works with no problems.<br />If I want to add an external disk (which has its own power), I&#039;ll need a hub, which means that the WGT will be powering the hub and the audio, but not the disk.<br />My hope is that I can use a non-powered hub - any guesses?</p><p>(Sorry for reviving a slightly-old question)</p>									</div>
