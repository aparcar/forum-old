					<p>Hi, I have questions about the built-in PA (power amplifer) and most importantly the LNA (low noise amplifer), tl-wa7210n has dedicated PA &amp; LNA that may improve the performance in noisy wireless enviroment.I believe UBNT or other products must have this component. </p><p>While outdoor device is relatively expensive, I found that indoor like wr2041n has similar PA&amp;LNA IC.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www.tp-link.com.cn/pages/promos/wireless/2012-08-24/images/4.jpg" alt="PunBB bbcode test" /></span><br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www.tp-link.com.cn/pages/promos/wireless/2012-08-24/images/1.jpg" alt="PunBB bbcode test" /></span></p><p>My QUESTION is , is it just hard drived, OR need to have code to support the PA &amp; LNA IC? </p><p>Found no other indoor products that has dedicated LNA chip, any idea?<br />Still no official support for wr2041n in OpenWrt....</p>									</div>

Is it to always keep PA_EN at 1,so the LNA can be activated during RX operation?How to activate the PA? by GPIO?</p><p>There also must be a way to configure antenna, maybe the water is not so deep as imagined,but no clue right now.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://hi.csdn.net/attachment/201103/27/0_13012097841kTd.gif" alt="PunBB bbcode test" /></span></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eeff11</strong> on 8 May 2014, 18:48)</p>
