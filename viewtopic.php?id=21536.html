					<p>I was trying to get SSH working yesterday and had to call it quits because it was getting late. I come back today, and now i can&#039;t even access the router. It&#039;s broadcasting wifi (which I can&#039;t successfully connect to) and when I plug in an ethernet cable it doesn&#039;t work properly either. The only way i&#039;ve been able to ping it is to plug a lan cable from my main router into the 652&#039;s WAN port. I am then able to ping 192.168.10.1.</p><p>I tried to open telnet, but no combination of my actual user name / root / admin with my pass or the default pass worked.</p><p>I don&#039;t know the proper way to reset this thing, I saw a forum post saying to hold down reset for 40 with it unplugged, plug it in, and let go of reset but this didn&#039;t work. Any other ideas? With 10 hours invested and a non-working router i&#039;m about to call this OpenWRT venture a bust and crawl back to an easier 3rd party firmware.</p>									</div>
