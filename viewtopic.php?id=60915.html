					<p>Hello, I have spent many hours researching (google started asking me if I am human), tried everything in the wiki and suggestions in the forum, I have still not been able to accomplish the following:</p><p>I would like my br-lan network interface to have 2 IP&#039;s in two different subnets&nbsp; belonging to two different firewall zones.<br />(My br-lan consists of eth0, eth1 and a wifi interface)</p><p>Is this possible? I want my lan firewall zone (br-lan) to be 192.168.1.0/24 and another (br-lan virtual adapter) to be used as wan 10.0.0.0/24 in order to access a dumb modem/router.</p><p>All suggestions I tried just add an ip to the existing ifconfig interface &quot;br-lan&quot; (and for this reason the firewall zones do not work as expected)</p><p>Ideally I would like an additional interface in ifconfig (like br-lan:1) with its own ip, bridged to br-lan but any other solution is welcome.<br />Thanks in advance</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>and.short</strong> on 14 Nov 2015, 11:31)</p>

					<p>After installing the kmod-dummy package/kernel module, you can create a &quot;dummy&quot; physical interface to which you can attach logical interfaces. For all intents and purposes, the dummy interface behaves like an ethernet port that will never have anything plugged into it.</p><p>(Sidebar: With one-port routers, after reassigning the single ethernet port to WAN the br-lan is somewhat dangling in the wind at startup and that creates problems with services wanting to attach to it at startup -- OpenVPN in my case.)</p><p>It&#039;s not all straightforward, though. IIRC it took me writing a custom init.d script to create the interface even before networking starts up. I don&#039;t have access to that particular machine right now, but I can look up my implementation later and amend this answer if you like.</p>									</div>

					<p>You need to create an interface before you can use it. I am not sure if it&#039;s the completely right way, but this works for me:</p><p>Install packages <em>kmod-dummy</em> and <em>ip</em>. Create a file, &quot;dummy_eth10&quot; (or similar) in /etc/init.d/ with this content:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common
START=19
STOP=10
start() {
        /usr/sbin/ip link set name eth10 dev dummy0
        /sbin/ifconfig eth10 hw ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
}</code></pre></div><p>&quot;xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx&quot; stands for a MAC address, I&#039;d suggest setting a similar (but not identical) one to your other ethernet ports&#039; MAC address, I myself varied the last digit.</p><p>Then you can chmod +x that file, and issue &quot;dummy_eth10 start&quot; and &quot;... enable&quot; just like any other service. Sequenced in at 19 in the start sequence it will be started right before &quot;network&quot;, so you can then reference eth10 as interface in the network configuration just as you would reference any other ethx interface.</p><br /><p>All that being said, I re-read your initial question and I&#039;m still not entirely sure what you are trying to achieve. If all you are trying is to reach the modem interface of your modem connected to WAN, it really isn&#039;t more difficult than setting up a second logical interface on the respective ethernet port and inserting it into the WAN firewall zone.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks again. The problem with creating a logical interface is that when i assign static ip or dhcp, this is then configured at the physical interface (br-lan) and not at my new logical interface (wan2 in my case)</p><p>My new interface appears with no ip address in luci.<br />Maybe there is a simpler way but i can not figure it out</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>and.short</strong> on 14 Nov 2015, 17:17)</p>

					<p>metai,</p><p>Thank you for your assistance. What you are suggesting is to use vlans which I do not want to, because both my lan and wan essentially are on the same vlan and interface. I have come to the conclusion that is a limitation of openwrt. I have found many unanswered relevant threads.</p><p>I would just like to rephrase my request just in case someone eventually comes to a solution:</p><p>Is it possible to have two networks (e.g. 192.168.1.0/24 and 10.0.0.0/24) on same interface? One would be on firewall zone LAN and the other on firewall WAN?</p><p>So e.g. in luci and ifconfig one would see:</p><p>Interface &quot;Lan Network&quot;, phys. interface &quot;br-lan&quot;, ip 192.168.1.1/24, firewall zone LAN<br />Interface &quot;P2P Link for modem&quot;, phys. interface &quot;br-lan&quot;, ip 10.0.0.1/24, firewall zone WAN</p><p>Although it might not be &quot;best practice&quot; network configuration, it solves other problems, especially in a home/small network. I also know that technically it is possible.</p><p>This is the only limitation I have come across with openwrt. I am otherwise very impressed!</p><p>Thanks again</p>									</div>

					<div class="quotebox"><cite>and.short wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>What you are suggesting is to use vlans</p></blockquote></div><p>I am not. That being said, many OpenWrt routers now come with VLANs out of the box, splitting the single ethernet port (&quot;eth0&quot;) using its internal switch into multiple &quot;virtual&quot; interfaces (&quot;eth0.1&quot; and &quot;eth0.2&quot;). But they may as well be two physical interfaces (&quot;eth0&quot; and &quot;eth1&quot;). Depends.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Is it possible to have two networks (e.g. 192.168.1.0/24 and 10.0.0.0/24) on same interface?</p></blockquote></div><p>Yes. Exactly how I described it: Attach two logical interfaces (&quot;wan&quot; and &quot;lan&quot;, but they can be named &quot;jeff&quot; and &quot;betsy&quot; for all the system cares) to the physical/virtual interface (&quot;eth0&quot;).</p><p>&quot;br-lan&quot;, by the way, is a different kind of virtual interface. It collects multiple physical or virtual interfaces and bridges them, so they act as one network. Most prominently, it does that across the Wifi and LAN interface.</p><p>I fail to see what good that your plan does, since usually the WAN machines (i.e., a modem or the inbound network) are attached to a different port than the LAN machines. Unless you give a little more insight into what you are actually trying to do, what the structure of your network is, or on what model and maker you are trying to achieve it I feel you are confusing yourself and everyone trying to answer.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 15 Nov 2015, 22:43)</p>
