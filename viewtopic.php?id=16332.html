					<p>Last night I started plugging servers into one of my VLANs (DMZ1) and can&#039;t seem to create a rule that allows them to access the Internet.&nbsp; Here are the lines I&#039;ve added to firewall.user:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>## allow DMZ1 to access internet
iptables -A FORWARD -i $DMZ1 -o $DMZ1 -j ACCEPT
[ -z &quot;$WAN&quot; ] || iptables -A FORWARD -i $DMZ1 -o $WAN -j ACCEPT
#[ -z &quot;$WAN2&quot; ] || iptables -A FORWARD -i $DMZ1 -o $WAN2 -j ACCEPT</code></pre></div><p>Seems pretty straightforward, but no worky.&nbsp; What did I miss?</p><p>BTW - Port forwarding TO servers on DMZ1 from the Internet works fine.&nbsp; I just can&#039;t browse from those same servers.&nbsp; Suggestions?</p>									</div>

					<p>Did you also add a MASQUERADE rule for DMZ1?&nbsp; By default, only the LAN gets NAT&#039;ed-</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>if [ $NAT_LAN -ne 0 ]

					<p>Thanks for the reply, Charlie.</p><p>I tried adding the MASQUERADE line to firewall.user and it still won&#039;t pass packets.</p><p>My configuration is posted in <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=15107">this</a> thread.&nbsp; Do you see anything about the way I&#039;ve set things up in /etc/init.d/firewall that is making this hard?</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok.&nbsp; Got it working:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>    # inside firewall.user
    # DMZ1 allow
    iptables -A FORWARD -i $DMZ1 -o $DMZ1 -j ACCEPT
    [ -z &quot;$WAN&quot; ] || iptables -A FORWARD -i $DMZ1 -o $WAN -j ACCEPT</code></pre></div><p>The problem was in how I was testing, not in what my configuration was...</p><p>I had a window open that was pinging yahoo continuously with the expectation that when the router started passing packets, yahoo would start responding to my pings.&nbsp; To my surprise, even though the continuous pinging method didn&#039;t work, if I stopped it and restarted (provided I had my config right), it worked!</p><p>If someone has had a similar problem and can explain what went on here, it would be great.</p>									</div>
