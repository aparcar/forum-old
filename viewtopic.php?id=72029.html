					<p>I want to be able to assign various amounts of incoming bandwidth for various clients and services on the network. At first, I thought QoS was meant for this, but I&#039;ve looked into it and it seems for outgoing traffic.</p><p>What I want to do is, a kind of inverse QoS. Let&#039;s say I have a 30Mbit connection and want to prioritize incoming traffic as follows:<br /></p><ul><li><p>1. Web browsing, small HTTP traffic</p></li><li><p>2. Video streaming, like Netflix</p></li><li><p>3. Large HTTP traffic, downloads, torrent traffic</p></li></ul><p>If it is too complicated to configure rules like this, it could be client bases as well; streaming devices like a Chromecast could be prioritized then.</p><p>Now, how should this be done? Which package is suitable?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>reynard80</strong> on 11 Sep 2017, 18:37)</p>
