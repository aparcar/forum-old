					<p>Dear all,</p><p>We have an FTTH connection from Deutsche Telekom, and they officially only support their own router brand (Speedport) and Fritz Box routers. I would like to use an openwrt box instead. A fibre modem is installed, so a simple router should suffice. Looking for a device that is well supported by OpenWRT I bought a D-Link DIR-860L, but at least with the stock firmware I don&#039;t get it to connect. I have connected the WAN port to the fibre modem and entered the credentials. The syslog says &quot;sending PADI to WLAN-1&quot; again and again, as if it is going nowhere. I don&#039;t know what this means, whether it is because the credentials are wrong or for some other reason. I thought the fact that it is an FTTH connection and not DSL should not make a huge difference, as the modem stil speaks PPPoE.&nbsp; <br />I still haven&#039;t flashed OpenWRT on this device, as I am considering to return it if it doesn&#039;t work. </p><p>Can someone enlighten me? Do I need a special router to handle my FTTH connection? As I said, the fibre modem is already installed, I don&#039;t need that part. Or should it work once I flash openwrt on the device?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>joro</strong> on 23 Nov 2016, 09:13)</p>

					<p>How can I tell the difference? The box says &quot;Glasfaser Modem&quot; <br />How would this make a difference for the router?</p>									</div>

					<p>Is this how the original setup looks like? <a href="https://www.computerbase.de/forum/showthread.php?t=1445889">https://www.computerbase.de/forum/showt â€¦ ?t=1445889</a></p><p>In that case, you had an ONT, a modem, and a router; in theory, you just need to replace the router. However, you must know how exactly to configure de router, as not all ISPs are the same. Most providers use PPPoE on a VLAN, so you need to know the ID for the VLAN, and the username and password for the PPPoE.</p><p>If your logs say &quot;sending PADI to <strong>WLAN-1</strong>&quot;, then there must be something wrong with your configuration, as PPPoE should not be trying to initiate any communication over the wireless network. If you post your /etc/config/network file here, someone will have a look at it.</p>									</div>
