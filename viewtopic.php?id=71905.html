					<p>So I&#039;m working on &quot;build 2&quot; of a WRT3200ACM.&nbsp; The first time around I went with LEDE stable from June to experiment a bit.&nbsp; This time I&#039;m going to dial it in a bit more.&nbsp; I have a laundry list of questions ranging from ACM specifics that davidc helped with in the earlier thread, to general choice questions, to one specific implementation question that&#039;s more of a Linux networking question.&nbsp; Hopefully some people will be able to help with a few pieces.</p><p>1) WRT3200: Would you guys recommend stable + the latest mwlwifi driver, or going with the latest snapshot on the 3200?&nbsp; I normally avoid snapshots in distros after spending waaaay too many years on Debian Sid and getting burned over and over. But since this is a work in progress it&#039;s a viable question.</p><p>2) WRT3200: I know davidc told me the other day that MU-MIMO is unsupported with no map for it....ugg!&nbsp; But I&#039;m curious if band shaping is currently supported?&nbsp; I know LEDE defaults to the same SSID for all radios, but I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s because it picked up on the band shaping, or if it just defaults for murky &quot;get one of the other randomly&quot; setups.&nbsp; For now I&#039;m separating the frequencies, but that&#039;s so messy.</p><p>3) OpenWRT: Bandwith/traffic monitoring.&nbsp; vnstats, and collectd/rrd seem to get wiped upon reboot.&nbsp; Yet those are the bandwith (and other stats) logging tools that have a nice Luci snap-in for viewing the stats.&nbsp; Is there any way to configure either or both of these to persistently store the metrics so they don&#039;t get wiped on reboot? </p><p>4) OpenVPN:&nbsp; Might be a question for the OpenVPN forums, but I figure the routing part is OpenWRT: How would I be able to route specific clients and/or ports direct to the wan, bypassing a VPN?&nbsp; I&#039;d like to get a little more sophisticated in how I route around my VPN, which is one of the big things I wanted to play with OpenWRT more with.&nbsp; I&#039;ve used OpenWRT for years but only surface level and would like to use it for some heavy lifting with this capable router! </p><p>I&#039;m going to post a separate thread for the more general Linux networking questions. I was going to put it here but I fear it would take this off topic.</p>									</div>

					<p>1) I am running trunk quite stable on my 3200acm. If it is better or worse than the stable release I don&#039;t know.

While in Debian, stable is the result of a long process (soft freeze, hard freeze, RC bugs, ...), in LEDE is appears to me a quite shorter process and more or less just a snapshot of trunk.</p><p>3) For vnstat, there is an option in /etc/vnstat.conf to set the location of the database file: DatabaseDir.

					<p>One reboot put the wifi behind the vpn.&nbsp; The next did not.&nbsp; There&#039;s definitely a timing issue of some sort where wireless is grabbing the gateway before the tun0 is setup.</p><p>Edit: What&#039;s weird is that both the wireless and wired are just part of eth0/br-lan.&nbsp; What&#039;s applying to one should be applying to the other, but that&#039;s not the case.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tux-o-matic</strong> on 29 Aug 2017, 00:02)</p>
