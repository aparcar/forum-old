					<p>I log in like every day from my work on my router, so I can IRC and play around a bit (and show off to colleagues <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" />). The box is now up for almost four days (I only recently finished configuration) and free showed an increasing memory usage, every time I logged in. First it was below 20 MB (out of 32 MB RAM), with like 2 MB cached. Now it is up to 25 MB already. </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@Zeus:~# free 
              total       used         free       shared      buffers
Mem:      30512     25404       5108     0              2052
Swap:     0            0              0
Total:     30512      25404       5108</code></pre></div><p>I was worried as to what could be eating my precious RAM, so I installed htop to get a second opinion. Htop shows me I am using a meagre 12 MB (If i interpret free&#039;s numbers correctly I have 25 MB used minus 2 MB buffers, makes 23 MB still). Check the screenie <a href="http://www.zero9.org/bling/openwrt-memusage.png">here</a>.</p><p>Interpreting free&#039;s output is usually no problem for me on a normal (non-embedded) linux box, are my eyes deceiving me, or is there something wrong with free? I know it&#039;s no independent binary, it links to busybox.</p><p>Any pointers?</p>									</div>
