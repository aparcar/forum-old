					<p>Hi,</p><p>I wanted to reset all the default values for the NVRAM and didn&#039;t read the warning about the WL500G bootloader not resetting defaults, before erasing the NVRAM on my WR850G.&nbsp; It seems that it is also in the category that you do not want to erase NVRAM, because I can&#039;t ping it anymore.&nbsp; </p><p>Is there a way to reload the NVRAM values?&nbsp; I do have access to another WR850G, and JTAG cable if that helps.</p><p>Thanks for the help!</p><p>Rob</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey Rob,</p><p>I&#039;m in a similar situation, or at least in a subset of your situation.&nbsp; My WR850 was running RC2 fantastically and so I set about configuring the network stuff the way I wanted.&nbsp; I must have set one of the nvram settings wrong because I did a &quot;nvram commit&quot;, power cycled and I haven&#039;t been able to connect to it ever since.&nbsp; </p><p>I&#039;m guessing that for your situation, you can use the JTAG and hairdairymaid util to backup the nvram from your working WR850G and then reflash it back onto your broken one.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never done this before, though.&nbsp; If you do it, I&#039;d be interested in hearing how it works out.&nbsp; </p><p>For my situation, I think I might be able to rig up a serial cable and just connect on the serial console and un-bork the nvram setting I made.&nbsp; Can anyone confirm this?&nbsp; I&#039;m going to order my USB cable today...</p><p>If that doesn&#039;t work, I may beg you for a working nvram image file.&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Frighteningly enough, there&#039;s still some documentation on the Wicki that tells you to do an &quot;nvram erase&quot; on a WR850G if you&#039;re having trouble getting an IP from dnsmasq.&nbsp; If I can figure out how, I&#039;ll put a warning note on that page.&nbsp; Which version of the WR850G did you break?&nbsp; V2 probably?&nbsp; It&#039;d be good to know which versions are safe and unsafe to &quot;mtd erase nvram&quot; on.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Starling,</p><p>I&#039;m working along the path you suggest.&nbsp; I&#039;m having trouble which others have had with the 2.6 kernel in Linux is telling me that the parallel port is locked.&nbsp; I&#039;m new to linux, only having used it for about a month, and so I&#039;m trying to figure out why I&#039;m getting that message which comes from an ioctl() call that is returning something less than 0 in the HairyDairyMaid debrick utility.</p><p>If I can get it going, I&#039;ll be glad to share the nvram settings with you.</p><p>Rob</p>									</div>

					<p>Having not done this myself, this is pure conjecture, but from what I&#039;ve read, you need to unload the &quot;lp&quot; kernel module (&quot;rmmod lp&quot;) and load the &quot;ppdev&quot; kernel module (&quot;insmod ppdev&quot;).&nbsp; But maybe you&#039;ve already discovered this...</p><p>All else fails, you could probably find a Windows JTAG program to use, if you&#039;re more comfortable in that environment.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I had compiled the parallel port stuff directly into the kernel.&nbsp; Your note made me think maybe I should try it as modules, and I did.&nbsp; I got a bit further in the process.&nbsp; Now ./wrt54 doesn&#039;t recognize the chip.&nbsp; I think it may be because I&#039;m using a wiggler type JTAG interface.&nbsp; The docs say that it may work, but I haven&#039;t read of anyone actually using one.&nbsp; It is interesting to note that the pins on these JTAG connectors were done with some forethought.&nbsp; You can plug a wiggler into the first 12 pins of the JTAG connector even if it is a 20 pin version, since the pin-out is the same.</p><p>It is also interesting to note that the LEDS do a different pattern when the JTAG connector is connected.</p><p>I&#039;ll keep you posted.</p><p>Rob</p>									</div>

					<p>I finally had some more time to play with my WR850G tonight and I built the serial cable from a Siemens cellphone data cable and was able to connect to the console.&nbsp; After a bit of poking, I finally realized that I&#039;d set vlan0hwname=eth0 instead of &quot;et0&quot;.&nbsp; I did that for vlan1 and vlan2 also.&nbsp; Ouch.&nbsp; So I fixed that and everything is great now.</p><p>Have you had any luck with your Moto?</p>									</div>

					<p>I did get the JTAG cable cobbled together, and backed up the CFE and NVRAM of both of my routers, then I tried flashing the NVRAM from the working router to the bricked one.&nbsp; It seemed to flash ok (after a couple of tries where it stopped halfway through).&nbsp; &nbsp;Unfortunately I still couldn&#039;t ping 192.168.10.1 on the bricked one.&nbsp; I then tried flashing the CFE from the good one to the bricked one, and then the trouble really started.&nbsp; Now it won&#039;t recognize the FLASH.&nbsp; It won&#039;t flash anything, even when I specify the type of flash and when I specify nobreak and/or noreset.&nbsp; It is kind of funny in that sometimes it will after a long wait claim it is flashing, but so far it always stops again part way through that process.&nbsp; It makes me wonder if my cable is too long (about 2 feet).&nbsp; At this point, I&#039;m not sure what to do.&nbsp; :-(</p><p>An interesting note is that the backup of the flash was not blank, so my earlier supposition that the NVRAM doesn&#039;t get re-written must not be right.</p><p>Rob</p>									</div>
