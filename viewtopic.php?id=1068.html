					<p>Hello,</p><p>we are working on a network consisting of APs (in Master mode). Each wrt needs to be run in Master mode to serve ordinary clients. Our problem is, that the APs needs to communicate with each other (many-to-many). Normally this is done via wired network. This is not possible in our case. Our question is, how can two APs communicate wireless? Is this only possible with WDS (wl wds)? We run the wireless cards in monitor and promiscuous mode and use packet sockets to build our own virtual router.</p><p>Greetings from Germany,<br />Jens</p>									</div>
