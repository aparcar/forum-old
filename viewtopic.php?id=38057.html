					<p>You can follow the wiki generic failsafe instructions to regain access to the router.<br />Microsoft internet connection sharing will probably work, just set the lan gateway to your windows pc ip and the lan dns to 8.8.8.8 or something.</p>									</div>

I expected it was gonna take an ip but unsucces.</p></blockquote></div><p>Your router is statically set to 192.168.1.1, so this doesnt work. You have quite some options:</p><p>1) set your &quot;lan&quot; interface in /etc/config/network to use DHCP<br />2) set a static address out of 192.168.0.x in the same file<br />3) temporarily configure it, will be gone after a reboot, something like:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ifconfig eth0:1 192.168.0.111 netmask 255.255.255.0
route del default
route add default gw 192.168.0.1
echo &quot;nameserver 192.168.0.1&quot; &gt; /etc/resolv.conf</code></pre></div><p>The latter is completely reversible and does not do any harm, its gone when you reboot. Just to be sure, i dont own an 703n: your interface could be named differently (take the name from your config and add the &quot;:1&quot; which configures an alias interface so your current telnet session does not vanish).</p><p>Nevertheless: downloading an image is important for a trunk release as they change daily. If you dont want to set up your own http server, at least store a complete set locally (take the imagebuilder, everything on board). Online update will work only untel the next trunk release using a slightly modified kernel config was built and uploaded, then you have to deal with warnings at least when installing kernel packages.</p>									</div>
