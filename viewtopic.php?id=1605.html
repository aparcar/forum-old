					<p>Here&#039;s my setup...</p><p>Router<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;System1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Server1</p><br /><br /><p>On Server1, there&#039;s a DNS server. What I had setup before, which was kind of an ugly way of doing it, was just forwarded port 53 (tcp &amp; udp) to Server1. It worked with a lot of fighting. Had to figure out how to make it stop forwarding its self.</p><p>Anyways. The new way I want to do it is simply add Server1&#039;s IP to /etc/resolv.conf and let the router&#039;s dnsmasq do all the work. This is working perfectly fine. Only on the intranet however. It wont respond to any internet requests.</p><p>Here&#039;s the config file:</p><p># filter what we send upstream<br />domain-needed&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />bogus-priv&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />filterwin2k</p><p># allow /etc/hosts and dhcp lookups via *.lan<br />local=/lan/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />domain=lan </p><p># no dhcp / dns queries from the wan<br />#except-interface=vlan1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p># enable dhcp (start,end,netmask,leasetime)<br />#dhcp-authoritative&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />dhcp-range=192.168.1.100,192.168.1.250,255.255.255.0,12h<br />dhcp-leasefile=/tmp/dhcp.leases&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p># use /etc/ethers for static hosts; same format as --dhcp-host<br /># &lt;hwaddr&gt; [&lt;hostname&gt;] &lt;ipaddr&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />read-ethers&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p># other useful options:<br /># default route(s): dhcp-option=3,192.168.1.1,192.168.1.2<br />#&nbsp; &nbsp; dns server(s): dhcp-option=6,192.168.1.1,192.168.1.2</p><br /><p>I can&#039;t find any documentation for using dnsmasq so it&#039;s kind of difficult to figure it out. I&#039;ve done a lot of iptables stuff to try and get it to work but still nothing. I had it to ACCEPT everything... But still.. gah...</p><br /><p>Any suggestions?</p>									</div>
