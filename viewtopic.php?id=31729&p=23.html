					<p>Hi, I have been use my 703n with openwrt at home connecting to my ethernet lan and it works fine.&nbsp; Now, I want to set it to be used in hotels so it need to connect to a wan.&nbsp; My question is if can set it this way in luci or I will need to manually edit the config/network file.&nbsp; Since it has only one ethernet port, it can only used for one purpose, right?&nbsp; I noticed catchmahesh have shown the content of his network file.&nbsp; I guess I can simply modify that.&nbsp; However, as maurer said, there is only one eth0 port so it should be used in the wan section.&nbsp; If I did so, do I need to delete eth0 in the &#039;ifname&#039; line and use &#039;wlan0&#039; instead?&nbsp; Finally, how should I set up the firewall file in this case?&nbsp; It will be great if somebody can give some examples of network and firewall files for this case. <br />Thanks in advance for your help.</p>									</div>
