					<p>Hi</p><p>I have a 505 Dlink with superwrt (light openewr CC distro with Luci),</p><p>I brought it with me on holiday to try and share the hotel Ethernet connection with all my devices. The hotel offer free wifi but all the devices must have a sim Facebook or Number and my sons tablets Can not use it.</p><p>I wanted to connect the Ethernet cable and the DLINK to share on the network wifi gia Luci.</p><p>Problem is I do not understand how to proceed. I am confused on what Using Between the wifi bridge and the Ethernet, my idea is That the wifi is acting as dhcp ip and Providing for all devices Whilst the hotel sees only the DLINK as MAC address. The first device connectin to the wifi and browsing Will it be my phone I use my Facebook account but CAN GIVE access to everybody.</p><p>Can you help me on That? Do I need additional Any package to superwrt?</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Sergio</p>									</div>

					<p>First of all: I am not familiar with &quot;SuperWrt&quot;. It seems to be a custom build with multiple preinstalled/preconfigured packages, much like some Community Builds in this forum.

					<p>eth1 is correct. You do not have two ethernet ports, but on the DIR-505, the single ethernet port is named eth1, not eth0.</p><p>As for your other problem, I really don&#039;t know, it certainly doesn&#039;t happen with my DIR-505 that is configured to do exactly what you want. It might have to do with some minor or major (mis-)configuration that comes with SuperWrt. As I said, one only needs standard OpenWrt for this particular use case, maybe you should start from scratch with a standard OpenWrt build?</p>									</div>
