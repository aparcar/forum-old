					<p>Hi,<br />AFAIK openvpn can create the needed tun device. However I am planning to have openvpn running this night on my wrt54g so I am going to drop you an eMail as soon as I have a setup running.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thomas</p>									</div>

					<p>that was it Nico, I had to insmod /lib/modules/2.4.20/tun.o</p><p>I installed Nico&#039;s tun-module, base-system, and openvpn from his site. I created /etc/openvpn to store all my stuff in.</p><p>I didn&#039;t see a modules.conf anywhere. So to get around that and load up my tunnel, I put the following at the bottom of /etc/init.d/rcS</p><p>insmod /lib/modules/2.4.20/tun.o<br />/usr/bin/dropbear<br />cd /etc/openvpn<br />/etc/openvpn/seymour.sh &amp;<br />sleep 10<br />/etc/openvpn/seymour-route.sh</p><br /><p>Here&#039;s my scripts contents...<br />/etc/openvpn/seymour.sh</p><p>openvpn --port 5009 --ping 15 --comp-lzo --float --remote &quot;ip of remote server&quot; --dev tun1 --ifconfig 10.4.0.9 10.4.0.1 --verb 5 --secret /etc/openvpn/key</p><p>/etc/openvpn/seymour-route.sh</p><p>route add -net 10.10.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 gw 10.4.0.1<br />route add -net 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 10.4.0.1</p><br /><p>My next step would be to pipe all traffic through the tunnel. I want to use these at some of our remote sites to tunnel all the traffic through using wrt54g&#039;s. </p><p>works like a champ aside from some errors. I am tunneling to a 1.6 version of openvpn. I need to figure out the whole cert ssl stuff as version 2 of openvpn won&#039;t let you use static keys anymore <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> </p><p>So 2 questions on this post..<br />Is there a better way to load the tun module at startup?<br />How can I route ALL the traffic through tun1? </p><br /><p>Thank you very much Nico for putting this stuff together.</p>									</div>

No, there is no such thing like /etc/modules.conf. You have to load modules by script or commandline, but you can leave out the path, if the modules are stored in /lib/modules/`uname -r`<br />2. Maybe if you set up a default route through tun1? To force connections to go through tun1, you can reject traffic at the &quot;physical&quot; interface with iptables and start syslogd with logfile i.e. /tmp/messages *and* &quot;klogd -c1&quot; to see the traffic trying to pass around tun1.<br />But beware, don&#039;t lock yourself out of the box ;-)</p><p>Only suggestions, maybe they are helpful.</p>									</div>
