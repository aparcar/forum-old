					<p>Hi baerle,</p><p>firstly thanks for the actual woking links!</p><p>I didn&#039;t work on this stuff for longer time, but I think I can help you anyway.</p><p>First be sure you have Edimax 3G-6200nL V2 (it is marked on the case), because the 3G-6200nL has a different chipset and you would brick this device! Only the V2 has the realtek chipset.</p><p>Flashing via tftp is very simple and if you have configured and compiled correctly all would flash fine.</p><p>When you start menuconfig you have to check in the submenu &quot;Target Images&quot; if the addresses are correct for your system.<br />For me it&#039;s this address config:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>(0x80500000) Load address of kernel in ram
(10000) Offset of kernel in flash rom (HEX)
(130000) Offset of filesystem in flash rom (HEX)
(0x800000) size of the flash rom
(530000) FLATFS image offset in flash</code></pre></div><p>This addresses are contained in the images and tftp burns automatically to the right location.</p><p>On the tftp console I did these commands:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>connect 192.168.1.6
put bin/realtek/openwrt-realtek-rtl8196c-nprove-squashfs.bin
put bin/realtek/openwrt-realtek-rtl8196c-nprove-kernel.bin</code></pre></div><p>It&#039;s important to flash the squashfs image first, because after burning the kernel image the device reboots automatically. If you do it the other way round the firmware doesn&#039;t work because of the missing filesystem.</p><p>The only thing you must take care of is that your image doesn&#039;t exceed the flash size. I had this one time and after that the bootloader was overwritten. Luckily the device has a serial flash chip and I made a backup of the original flash, so I could solder out the chip and restore to factory defaults.</p><p>Hope this helps you!</p><br /><p>P.S.: I still have the problem, that I can&#039;t access via LAN with my firmware (the problem I mentioned at the beginning of the thread). I was fed of it and that&#039;s the reason why I didn&#039;t work on that stuff any longer.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, I started from the beginning again. And now it works! I can access via LAN, works fine.</p><p>The problem with the USB is, that it the power can be switched off by GPIO.

					<p>Hi Tomate,</p><p>I got this information by educated guessing:</p><p>1st: I have found a PDF Datasheet for the 8196C: There the PIN_MUX register was explained. I searched the sources and found a few accesses, but nothing 100% clear for me what might be wrong.</p><p>2nd: Then I noticed that USB power was on(!) during booting, and then &quot;suddenly&quot; stopped:<br />So I knew there was a trigger in &quot;userspace&quot;, obviously something from the init part. I didn&#039;t notice the led-file earlier.</p><p>3rd: in the PDF the LED part for the Ethernet-switch LEDs was explained, so I tried to change them to GPIO and it worked:<br />For that you have to use that other 0x343FC0 value. I decided to post this information here, as it is at least nice to know.<br />Edit: To make it clear: the additional bits configure the MUX to connect the &quot;internal GPIO&quot; with the external pin. So writing to the GPIO without changing that Mux will not change the Pin. It depends what you want: Ethernet Information or GPIO controlled LEDs. Both is possible.</p><p>4th: I searched in the Edimax GPL Sources and noticed there was GPIO6 used for the usb power, so that matched: <br />GPIO6 is the usb power. I don&#039;t have a &quot;power LED&quot; on my board.<br />Edit: but it is inverted, so the write in that init-file disabled the power.</p><p>Then there was still one LED missing: The one between USB and the button:<br />So I took photos from both sides of the board, loaded them to inkscape, rotated a bit and mirrored. I also placed the pin-out graphic from the PDF on top of the chip: I never did something like that before, but it worked really well: I got both sides on top of each other and then could easily follow the lines: USB was as already noticed on GPIO6, and the last LED was controlled by PortC[0], so GPIO16. I also did this to check the other GPIO pins: Pin 102 is at the edge of the chip and seems not to be used: If I want to control a hardware, that would be a nice pin I expect.<br />(I edited my posting for that, so all LEDs are &quot;documented&quot; now)</p><p>Currently I&#039;m comparing the kernel of that GPL-things, and the one I&#039;m using:<br />There is one strange thing that might be the reason for my problem:<br />In the Edimax &quot;GPL&quot; Kernel there is an &quot;ehci-rtl8652.c&quot; driver used (not the rtl-819x.c).<br />And I found a &quot;realtek patch&quot; in &quot;check_reset_complete&quot; that will do 3 retries in that code.<br />I know that this 8652 driver is used (you can find messages from it in this thread, and there is also a<br />#if defined(CONFIG_RTL_8196C)<br />inside, so I&#039;m sure it is for &quot;our&quot; chip.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>baerle</strong> on 29 Jan 2015, 12:24)</p>

					<p>Really don&#039;t know what still might be wrong (I started to expect the worst...)</p><p>But I have the image of my dslr camera on my smartphone now!<br />Via ddserver and WLAN from that &quot;Edimax 6200nL v2&quot; device.</p><p>(And I made a tar copy from my whole build dir, so I cannot lose it:<br />currently to many edits in to many files...)</p><p>Edit:<br />I will try to make it reproducable: Currently I have edited directly in the kernel sources.

					<p>Guys, I&#039;ve got a question regarding sources you use to build a firmware. It seems like you follow git repo made available by former nprove employee and looking into sources it looks like realtek target there is based on 2.6.30 kernel. At the same time I was able to find and download tarball named 00002778-rtk_openwrtSDK_v2.1_20140314_full.tar.gz (there was a link posted earlier in this thread) which claims to contain the SDK for realtek-based routers based on OpenWRT. Checking its contents reveals that it is based on a more fresh snapshot of openwrt and realtek target is based on kernel 3.10.</p><p>Thus I&#039;m curious about two things:<br />1) Had you tried using &quot;rtk_openwrtSDK_v2.1_20140314&quot; to check if USB works with it out of the box?<br />2) Does anyone here have any idea what is the source of &quot;rtk_openwrtSDK_v2.1_20140314&quot;? Is it an official release from realtek or is it some internal project that had leaked to public somehow?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Lexa2,</p><p>Thanks for your hint.<br />My primary interest was to get that router hardware work for me, not a specific kernel or openwrt version, not even &quot;current&quot; was important: I don&#039;t plan to use it as a &quot;router&quot;, so I don&#039;t see security issues: I will typically not connect it to the internet at all. Tomate has mentioned he had tried it on the same hardware, so I thought, give it a try, and if it works with my software, I&#039;m done with it.<br />If I would have got the GPL packet from Edimax compiled, I would have used that for my &quot;problem&quot;.<br />(Edit: I was able now to compile that and load the generated image to the device, it runs and USB works with that)</p><p>As I have found a few things like those GPIO things, I wanted to publish that, maybe someone else has the same questions? <br />And while compiling the original git I had to solve a few little problems: it didn&#039;t work out of the box as a few URLs where out of date or whatever, so I published these changes: At least I had these question, nothing difficult, but it might help someone. Another copy of that repository doesn&#039;t hurt I think?</p><p>I know nothing about 2), but for 1):<br />I didn&#039;t take a look to that package you mentioned when I started, but now I have downloaded the file:<br />I&#039;m not sure it will help after having a first look: My router has a rtl8196c. No default config for that chip: That tar-ball mentions these chips:<br />rtl8198C<br />rtl8954E<br />rtl8197D<br />rtl8196E<br />rtl8881A<br />I can&#039;t even select the right one (for me) in menuconfig. So: Nothing I plan to dig into.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>baerle</strong> on 4 Feb 2015, 16:50)</p>

					<p>I had no troubles (except for slow download speed for &quot;free download&quot;) fetching tar.gz and it was what I expected it to be. No adware or any other binaries from Windows world. I suspect that you might press on the wrong link and get some adware or so-called &quot;download-manager downloader&quot; instead of fetching a direct link. It is typical for file hosting sites to place nice and big &quot;DOWNLOAD IT NOW&quot; buttons that lead to anything except for the real file you want to download. Try again and keep as much attention as you can on what you click and you should end up with a real download link.</p><p>P.S. Just tried pressing that big fancy green download button on solidfiles site using Google Chrome running under Linux Mate DE. Got normal tar.gz as expected and not *.tar.gz.exe.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lexa2</strong> on 6 Feb 2015, 18:13)</p>
