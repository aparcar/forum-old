					<p>No, it&#039;s to use to be primary and secondary dns server for several domains.</p><p>I see that fetchzone is not included in thz maradns package :-(.</p><p>And in the doc, they say that it&#039;s used for secondary domains.</p><p>There is a way to install it? :-)</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Regarding maradns, is there also a &quot;fetchzone&quot; port available?<br />I just installed maradns and it looks good - but it relies on &quot;fetchzone&quot; for zone-transfers.&nbsp; Unfortunately my ipkg doesn&#039;t know about &quot;fetchzone&quot; and the package tracker seems to be unavailable at the moment...</p><p>Or is there another solution to run DNS with multiple domains and primary/secondary support on openwrt? There is no need for fancy stuff like dnssec or dhcp-updates, just redundant multi-domain support?</p><p>And this leads to another question: Is there a method of disabling only the dns-component of dnsmasq while still using it as a dhcp server? Or, if I run maradns, what do I use as dhcp-server? ipkg only knows about a forwarder, not a dhcp-server.</p><p>Thanks in advance, Marcus</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve looked into the fetchzone issue a bit: It seems that the maradns-port for openwrt is a little bit older, my binary reports version 1.0.26. The version on the maradns homepage is 1.2.03.3. On maradns.org there is talk about a potential security bug in fetchzone version 1.1.37 along with the comment that it&#039;s new to version 1.1. BUT there is a &quot;getzone&quot; binary, maybe worth a look...</p><p>Regards, Marcus</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, &quot;getzone&quot; does the zonetransfer, so you can regularily transfer your zones from the primary and write them to a local file. I&#039;m not sure, but I don&#039;t think that you&#039;ll have the possibility to &quot;notify&quot; your maradns about a change on the primary. So far I have successfully retrieved my zones from my BIND server and configured the mararc to use those zones. I had to add the following lines to the mararc, it won&#039;t start as root:<br />maradns_uid=65534<br />maradns_gid=65534</p><p>Now, maradns starts without errors and listens to UDP port 53, but fails to answer any requests :-( Does anybody have experiences with this?</p><p>Thanks, Marcus</p>									</div>
