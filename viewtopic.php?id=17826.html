					<p>Hello community,</p><p>I really like the Version of kamikaze and therefore I did a clean install yesterday. Right now I am struggling with the qos script due to not well written documentation &quot;QoSHowto&quot;. Do someone of you know a good tutorial which explain the different variables and how the affect the bandwitdh?</p><p>&quot;This first part of the config file sets up our 4 buckets. (Fix this to correspond to pktsize/pktdelay/avgrate/share) &quot;Class&quot; names the policy, &quot;maxdelay&quot; is the maximum delay we would like to craft (in ms). &quot;Rate&quot; and &quot;limit&quot; are pretty self-explainatory, in kbits/sec.&quot;</p><p>This sentence help me in no way, despite of the fact that the avgrate doesn&#039;t work as explained. I know the basic concept of QoS and its different technics handling traffic, but this script drives me crazy.</p><p>For example I played with the settings avgrate and whether I set 10 or 20, nothing happened. I can&#039;t really believe that the value is kbit. With &quot;10&quot; I got a rate of 60 kB/s. There a lot more variables which are not understandable for me without testing and testing for weeks.</p><p>So I hope somebody of you knows a good tutorial, because I would like to understand how the script works.</p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Capricious</strong> on 25 Nov 2008, 22:24)</p>

					<p>pktsize is the expected packet size (in bytes) for the kind of traffic you want to push into this class (very important)<br />pktdelay is the maximum delay which is guaranteed when there is no overallocation of bandwidth<br />avgrate is the guaranteed average rate (in % of the link rate)<br />share (also in %) affects the distribution of the remaining bandwidth after the bandwidth guarantees have been satisfied.<br />all class parameters are independent of the line speed, and you should probably leave them at default unless you know what you&#039;re doing.<br />the default parameters are tuned for most common setups.<br />the main thing that needs changing is the upload and download rate.</p>									</div>
