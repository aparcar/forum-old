					<p>Hi!</p><p>I&#039;m a proud owner of an asus rt-n16. Recently flashed OpenWrt on it, and i&#039;m trying to set up a lamp configuration. Everything is working, except the link between php and mysql becouse there is no package php5-mod-mysqli. So, how do i get mysqli.so?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jumika</strong> on 25 Feb 2013, 13:43)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m guessing you flashed the snapshot?<br />AArc1 has what you need. If you insist on the snapshot you will have to compile it yourself or wait for the buildbots to get round to it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, i&#039;m using a snapshot. Using Attitude Adjustment is not an option for me, as far as i know rt-n16 is only supported in latest builds.<br />Than i&#039;m gonna build it for myself. Thanks for your help.<br />By the way how does buildbot works? It is just building the packages from time to time without user interaction?</p>									</div>

					<p>biuldbots are autonomous 21C robots: they will destroy our world if they ever manage to build all the packages in the root before we do.<br />We try to keep up,&nbsp; but the ever increasing draw of just having one of the cocktails in the recipe of the current build debilitates us all!<br />Save yourselves. Now! Please, I am begging you: get a router that is supported in AArc1!!!! Attitude Adjustment is the best! Don&#039;t make us make a new cocktail!<br />For the love of linux!</p>									</div>
