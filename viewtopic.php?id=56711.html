					<p>I belileve the rootfs is contained in openwrt-oxnas-pogoplug-pro-ubifs-sysupgrade.tar, the file is simply named &quot;root&quot;, it should be squashfs.</p><p>According to an e-mail conversation I had with Daniel Golle (the maintainer of the original openwrt-oxnas fork) a few months ago, the oxnas target in trunk is a bit of a mess right now, mainly because the buildbot (or rather the makefile) is not able to build multiple targets per run. For the time being, if you need a different oxnas image than the Pogoplug Pro you&#039;ll have to build it yourself.</p>									</div>

It&#039;s a problem of the makefile code. There are some targets that are not built at the moment, and some others are using &quot;hacked&quot; makefiles to build different targets (ramips is one of them I believe). Last time we talked, Daniel said that he and some other people would be working on modifying the makefile code, but I don&#039;t know how that progressed in the last months.</p>									</div>
