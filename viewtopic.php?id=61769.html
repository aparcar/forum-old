					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a dual-stack Windows DNS server that is resolving queries for my local DNS domain. I have my dual-stack openwrt box (bb14.07) configured to forward queries:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config dnsmasq
        option domainneeded &#039;1&#039;
        option boguspriv &#039;1&#039;
        option localise_queries &#039;1&#039;
        option rebind_protection &#039;1&#039;
        option rebind_localhost &#039;1&#039;
        option authoritative &#039;1&#039;
        option local &#039;/lan/&#039;
        option expandhosts &#039;1&#039;
        option readethers &#039;1&#039;
        option leasefile &#039;/tmp/dhcp.leases&#039;
        option resolvfile &#039;/tmp/resolv.conf.auto&#039;
        option domain &#039;mydomain.eu&#039;
        list server &#039;/mydomain.eu/192.168.1.2&#039;
        list server &#039;/mydomain.eu/&lt;myv6prefix&gt;::2&#039;</code></pre></div><p>My clients obtain DHCP settings from the openwrt box. When the client is dual-stack all is fine, name resolution works fine for mydomain.eu. On a v4 only client (or a dual-stack client with v6 disabled) name resolution fails for *.mydomain.eu names.</p><p>A packet capture showed that whenever a v4-only client issues a DNS query, it reaches the openwrt box which creates the following queries:<br />- DNS query over v4 for an A record<br />- DNS query over v6 for an A record</p><p>The DNS server answers both queries correctly, with an A record. The response from the openwrt box however does not contain any records (no answer section in the response).</p><p>Why is dnsmasq not forwarding the response properly?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mcfly9</strong> on 27 Dec 2015, 13:43)</p>

					<p>Silly me. Seems to be the rebind protection that is stripping the response. Added </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>list rebind_domain &#039;mydomain.eu&#039;</code></pre></div><p> to the config and works perfect!</p>									</div>
