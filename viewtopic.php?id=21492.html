					<p>hi,</p><p>is it possible that I somehow got on a blacklist of openwrt.org? I can ping openwrt.org but not access it via browser. Eventually I managed to get here by using a vpn-client that gives me a different ip. Because my provider always assigns the same ip-address to me, I don&#039;t see a different way to reach openwrt.org. What else could be the problem, if there is no such blacklist, or what can I do to get off that list? </p><br /><p>A few days ago I installed a dd-wrt on my router and had problems with updating my package list for my package manager &quot;ipkg&quot;.<br />I just tried: &quot;ipkg update&quot; but the download failed with timeout. Now I figured out, that ipkg update is trying to wget the package list from &quot;downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/packages/Packages&quot; without success. For some reason I just cannot wget anything from openwrt.org, nor can I browse it. Only &quot;ping openwrt.org&quot; does work.</p><p>Thanks for your help or any hint!</p><p>thassilo</p>									</div>

					<p>hey,</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>The server has been moved recently so I would guess it is a problem with your DNS cache not being updated, or even your upstream DNS server not having been updated yet.</p></blockquote></div><p>wow and thanks! This was really helpful!</p><br /><p>With vpn-connection enabled, I got the following:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ping openwrt.org
Ping openwrt.org [78.24.191.177] mit 32 Bytes Daten:
...</code></pre></div><p>and without vpn-connection:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ping openwrt.org
Ping openwrt.org [195.56.146.238] mit 32 Bytes Daten:
...</code></pre></div><p>So now I see that 78.24.191.177 is the correct ip-address which I can also reach without the vpn-connection.</p><p>BUT - I still don&#039;t know how to access &quot;downloads.openwrt.org/...&quot;, because &quot;downloads.78.24.191.177/...&quot; obviously doesn&#039;t work.</p><p>I am a n00b at this, so maybe my next ideas are nonsense...</p><p>I changed the order of the two nameserver addresses in /tmp/resolv.dnsmasq and in order to clear the DNS cache and re-read the config files I run the command:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>killall -1 dnsmasq</code></pre></div><p>Nothing happened. Is it possible that my provider is using an old dns cache? And if yes - what can I do??</p><p>thx!!</p><p>thassilo</p>									</div>

					<p>You can try adding 78.24.191.177 to your hosts file - /etc/hosts</p><p>Alternatively wait a while and your upstream DNS servers will update themselves. Some cache old addresses for up to a week so it could take a while. It is always a pain to access sub domains after DNS updates so to be honest I would just keep trying to access it periodically and eventually it will work...</p>									</div>
