					<p>fyi,</p><p>Can you please elaborate - how this link relates to my question? I don&#039;t have excessive traffic; I have specific computers on specific subnet somewhere in China poking my services. I see unsuccessful attempts in HTTP log, in FTP log, and attempts to connect through SSH.<br />So, I am trying to block specific address range. I don&#039;t understand how this link applies.</p><p>Or - you meant to post it in some other thread?</p>									</div>

					<p>1)<br />Make sure that your rule is the first rules in the iptables rulechain, so that an &quot;accept rule&quot; does not have time to accept the packet first, before the drop rule sees it.</p><p>2)<br />Elaborating jow&#039;s question a bit: the &quot;INPUT&quot; chain and its subchains handle traffic to the router itself, while &quot;FORWARD&quot; chain (and subchains) handle the traffic through the router to the LAN. You might set the drop rule to the both chains.</p>									</div>

					<p>@jow. Input rule (I want to drop the packets; how would I specify it in the forward?) But the logs I am looking are on the other server; so *forwarding* is not prevented. I don&#039;t have logs on the router itself for space reasons. Are you suggesting that putting input rule doesn&#039;t prevent from forwarding?</p><p>hnuman: 1. it is the first rule<br />2. How do I specify DROP in FORWARD rule (either in UI, or if impossible - in iptables command)? Also, for testing, I set a similar blocking rule for a single IP address. It stopped me cold for both &quot;INPUT&quot; and &quot;FORWARD&quot; ports</p>									</div>

					<p>ymhee_bcex, correct - input does not prevent forward and forward does not prevent input.

					<p>jow, thank you very much - I didn&#039;t realize that! Indeed, with two rules it works exactly as I would like it.</p><p>The bad part - I can&#039;t set &quot;prevent forward&quot; from UI. The good part - if I set this rule in /etc/config/firewall, it doesn&#039;t get wiped out when I make unrelated changes through UI (X-Wrt had such problem). This custom rule even shows in some funny way in input rules table.</p><p>I can also specify iptables rule in the &quot;custom rules&quot; tab which will put it in /etc/firewall.user</p><p>Love OpenWrt</p>									</div>
