					<p>[[SOLVED]] - via reset button<br />Thanks a lot for the quick and thorough response. I guess I did not use the reset button correctly because this morning I asked a coworker (who also has the HooToo with OpenWRT) and he had a similar issue. What I did yesterday was press and hold the reset button during boot, which apparently brings us to that TFTP interface. What my coworker suggested was to press and hold (~30s worked but I don&#039;t know the minimum time to hold it) while the device was turned on. When I released the reset button it booted and seemed to bring the config back to a fresh-install state. I logged into the router via ethernet port at 192.168.1.1 and it gave me the LuCI interface and the &quot;no password set&quot; warning. </p><p>Thanks again for the quick response and now I know what I need to do if I lock myself out a little worse than I did this time <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>HooTooJunkie wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Hi, I managed to be locked-out in a similar manner, but was able to &quot;reset&quot; it by getting into the serial console and enter the <strong>firstboot</strong> command, then <strong>reboot</strong></p><p>That&#039;s really the easiest way, other than reprogramming the flash chip, manually.</p><p>If you already tried TFTP you most likely already know how to access it&#039;s serial console.<br />If not...<br />You&#039;ll need to attach a USB to TTL Serial cable to the built-in serial console connector pins on the board to do it.</p><p><strong>wingspinner</strong> explains where to get, and how to connect this cable to it, earlier in this thread.</p><p>I used the new Prolific chip cable, and driver, <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/954">http://www.adafruit.com/products/954</a><br />but there&#039;s another cable, that&#039;s a bit more expensive.

I need some help with my TM02. I am pretty sure I accidentally disabled all interfaces to enable on boot and now naturally I cannot access the device at all.

					<p>You have configured the switch to not use VLANS.&nbsp; So you should put lan on eth0 and forget eth0.1, it doesn&#039;t really exist.</p><p>Also your router&#039;s address needs to be 192.168.( something other than 1) because your main router has address 1.</p>									</div>

					<p>First, thanks again to Wingspinner and others. I am using my TM02 to serve up my <strong>ext4</strong> formatted portable hard drive which contains my videos, music, etc to my Android devices through <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/nfs.server">nfs</a>. <a href="http://kodi.tv/">Kodi</a> has native <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/nfs.server">nfs</a> support on Android. No root is required. The TM02 is connected to a Rav Power battery pack.</p><p>I wanted to add a UPnP service to my TM02. There are hardware devices such as the Sangean WFR-28 that support UPnP. In addition, there are Android UPnP clients that will play music in the background like UPnPlay (<a href="http://kodi.tv/">Kodi</a> doesn&#039;t work in the background on Android).</p><p>I installed <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/minidlna">minidlna</a>. In order to get to to work, I had to do the following<br /></p><ul><li><p>Create a 64Mb swap file on the <strong>ext4</strong> formatted portable hard drive connected to the TM02 and enable it. <br /></p><ol class="decimal"><li><p>mkdir /PathToHardDrive/HooToo<br /></p></li><li><p>dd if=/dev/zero of=/PathToHardDrive/HooToo/swapfile bs=1024 count=65536<br /></p></li><li><p>mkswap /PathToHardDrive/HooToo/swapfile<br /></p></li><li><p>Add the following lines to <em>/etc/config/fstab</em><br /></p><ul><li><p>config swap</p></li><li><p>option enabled &#039;1&#039;</p></li><li><p>option device &#039;/PathToHardDrive/HooToo/swapfile&#039;</p></li></ul></li></ol></li><li><p>modify the following <em>/etc/config/minidlna</em> lines to put the&nbsp; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/minidlna">minidlna</a> database and log file on the hard drive<br /></p><ul><li><p>option db_dir &#039;/PathToHardDrive/HooToo&#039;</p></li><li><p>option log_dir &#039;/PathToHardDrive/HooToo&#039;</p></li><li><p>option inotify &#039;0&#039;</p></li><li><p>list media_dir &#039;A,/PathToHardDrive/PathToMp3s&#039;</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Build the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/minidlna">minidlna</a> database <em>/PathToHardDrive/HooToo/files.db</em> on a Linux PC with <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/minidlna/files/minidlna/1.1.4/">minidlna 1.1.4</a>.<br /></p><ul><li><p>Ensure the PC portable hard drive mount point is&nbsp; the <strong>exactly</strong> the same as the TM02 hard drive mount point. Otherwise, the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/minidlna">minidlna</a> on the TM02 will delete and rescan the database you generated on the PC since the paths don&#039;t match</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>The key to this is to build the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/minidlna">minidlna</a> database, <em>files.db</em> on a Linux PC. The TM02 does not have the memory to build the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/minidlna">minidlna</a> database - especially if you have over 5,000 mp3s. However, once the&nbsp; database is built, the TM02 can easily support <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/minidlna">minidlna</a> UPnP listing and streaming.</p>									</div>
