					<p>I am new to OpenWRT coming from DD-WRT and so far I am loving the firmware. I am trying to follow the &quot;L2TP over IPsec with PSK using racoon/xl2tpd&quot; guide on setting up the IPSec tunnel, however, I am having some issue figuring out how to allocate enough space to install all the packages needed. I tried removing them in the GUI, but it doesn&#039;t appear to be freeing up any space in the process. If anyone can provide pointers it will be much appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>Might I suggest arokh&#039;s WNDR3700 builds? The alternate build contains a working installation of racoon, which should be right up your alley. I use the standard build on my WNDR3700v1 and it&#039;s been working flawlessly for quite some time now.</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27722">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27722</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>got_milk</strong> on 15 Apr 2012, 03:39)</p>

					<p>Thank you for the reply! I flashed it with the alternate build. However after adding the psk and user and pass to chap-secrets I am still unable to connect. Both l2tpd and racoon were restarted and verified running. Are there any extra configurations I need to do besides though 2 things?</p>									</div>

					<p>Fixed! Looks like it was the permission on psk.txt. It didn&#039;t like the default 0644.</p>									</div>
