					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have been thinking of reasons why one would need to load OpenVpn on an Openwrt router.</p><p>I did find the following on a site describing what you can do with OpenWrt:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Use the SSH Server for SSH Tunneling: OpenWrt includes an SSH server so you can access its terminal. If you expose the SSH server to the Internet (be sure to secure it with key-based authentication instead of a weak password), you can access it remotely and use SSH tunneling to forward your traffic over the encrypted connection. This allows you to securely access websites from public Wi-Fi and access websites that can only be accessed in your home country while travelling abroad.<br />Set Up a VPN: SSH tunneling works similarly to a VPN in many ways, but you could also set up a proper VPN on your OpenWrt router.]</p></blockquote></div><p>Does the above represent a configuration where one can access the router (connected to a modem from your isp) securely from the internet in another country (where there may be restrictions on which sites one can enter). In other words you may be in a place where you can&#039;t access certain sites directly. Then one can access internet sites local to your country by using that same modem (and your isp) through OpenWrt. That sounds like what I am reading but I would like some clarification if I am wrong.</p><p>Thank You<br />Tom</p><br /><p>Thank You<br />Tom</p>									</div>

					<p>Max Hopper,</p><p>Thank you for the&nbsp; reply. Doing some research I see that in order to initiate contact with a server/computer that is behind a firewall, a port must be opened up in the router firewall to allow such a connection.</p><p>My question is, how does Skype not have to do this. I read the following: </p><p> &quot;When you install Skype, a port above 1024 is chosen at random as the port for incoming connections.&quot;</p><p>My understanding is that a port must be opened in the modem firewall. Is this correct? I have used Skype from my tablet computer without having to explicitly open up a port inside it. </p><p>Clearly, I am confused as to when port forwarding is required.</p><p>Thank You<br />Tom</p>									</div>

					<p>Port forwarding will help you to look for &quot;outsiders&quot; as if you were surfing &quot;from home&quot;. (Actually, your ISP will see two connections: one encrypted - the SSH one - coming from somewhere out there, the other one - a usual HTTP connection from your home to some website elsewhere. A website will see just one connection - the HTTP coming from your home IP-address)<br />For this scenario SSH port forwarding is enough.</p><p>If you also need to access resources on your own home network - like shared printers, disk storages, etc - you will need the VPN for that. Preferably - the OpenVPN.<br />Your ISP - just like in the explanation above - will see an encrypted connection coming from somewhere out there - the OpenVPN connection to your home IP-address. If you will check your e-mails, surf or torrent - all will be visible to ISP as well. Your transfers to/from your disks or printers will be secured properly.<br />If you travel with a small laptop - you could use OpenVPN to secure the Remote Desktop connection so that if you have your desktop on at home - you could use it as if you were there yourself. If you loose your laptop - all your files and documents remain safe - provided you have a strong password for your OpenVPN login and if you keep the private key of your SSL certificate (used for OpenVPN authentication) on a removable storage (only attaching it to your laptop when OpenVPN is required).</p><p>I&#039;ll be glad to answer your further questions.<br /><img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>booBot</strong> on 17 Aug 2016, 17:48)</p>

					<p>Thank You booBot,</p><p>I realize that this last question is OT and I apologize. </p><p>How does Skype get through on a modem that does not have port forwarding enabled?
