					<p>Hello everybody, <br />I hate to do this but I need help urgently. After reading many posts, to see many examples that come with kamikaze I am still unable to compile a complex software, and I need to do now. <br />If someone were kind enough to help me&nbsp; in compiling this software, would be eternally grateful. <br />This is the link: <a href="http://hipl.hiit.fi/hipl/release/1.0.3/noarch/hipl--release--1.0.3.tar.gz">http://hipl.hiit.fi/hipl/release/1.0.3/ â€¦ 0.3.tar.gz</a><br />And it has to be compiled for an Asus W500gp and kamikaze.<br />Any help is welcome.</p><p>Thank you!</p>									</div>
