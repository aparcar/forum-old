					<p>Hi</p><p>I&#039;ve got a couple of chinese ZBT-WR8305RT, they are based on the MT7620 and they have been discussed previously in this thread<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=50466">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=50466</a></p><p>This devices came preloaded wit 12.09 with pandora box. (Chinese clone)</p><p>I&#039;ve found out this devices are quite difficult to brick, I&#039;ve been playing with the configurations and a couple times I end up with an unreachable device, I&#039;ve just downloaded the firmware from the chinese repository (<a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org.cn/PandoraBox/ZBT-WR8305RT/">http://downloads.openwrt.org.cn/Pandora â€¦ -WR8305RT/</a>) and I was able to recover the device to its original status.</p><p>I&#039;m starting to like it because it has 32mb ram and 16mb flash and it&#039;s quite cheap $18dll and if you buy larger quantities you get $11 price.</p><br /><p>Right now I have the problem I can&#039;t set the wireless interface in monitor mode, I would like to run airodump but everytime I tried to add the mon0 I get this:</p><br /><div class="codebox"><pre><code> airmon-ng start ra0

					<p>Hi. I&#039;ve pushed 3 seconds the reset button at booting, then i got the restore firmware screen and I uploaded the bin image of the firmware, I&#039;ve downloaded the image from the chinese openwrt site, it&#039;s easy to find, just look for the image belonging to that model.</p>									</div>
