					<p>I&#039;m unsuccessfully trying to set up a WDS connection between 2 similar devices running openWRT. Both devices have a static IP, DHCP disabled and should bridge a network on layer 2.</p><p>The first one (A) is an TP-WR1043ND [1] running Backfire 10.03.1.<br />The second one (B) is an WR841ND [2] ver 8.1 running Attitude Adjustment 12.09-rc1.</p><p>Their Network-&gt;Wifi-&gt;device configuration is identical. A is the WDS access point, creating A_ESSID, no encryption. B is a WDS client with A_ESSID. <br />1) First question here, the BSSID here should be an arbitrary one or should it match As MAC? Both didn&#039;t work.</p><p>All I can see is that B shows &quot;Wireless is disabled or not associated&quot; and that it&#039;s not working <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" />. I do not find any logs regarding wireless handshaking on either of the devices. Furthermore, my to A wireless connected laptop isn&#039;t shown it As &quot;Associated Stations&quot;. <br />2) Where can I find any further information why the devices don&#039;t connect to ask proper follow up questions?</p><p>I read the Clientmode guide [3], but it is very compact regarding the actual WDS configuration. Should I try setting up the configs manually, like in [4]? I do feel a bit like being in the without any error messages.</p><p>[1] <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd</a><br />[2] <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd</a><br />[3] <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode</a><br />[4] <a href="http://kamikaze.openwrt.org/docs/openwrt.html#x1-120001.2.2">http://kamikaze.openwrt.org/docs/openwr … 120001.2.2</a></p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s now somehow working. I wasn&#039;t able to setup WDS directly, but I had to network-&gt;wifi-&gt;search-&gt;connect on the WDS client and then switch the config from client to WDS client in order to get WDS up. </p><p>To answer the BSSID MAC question &quot;In wds mode specifies the BSSID of another AP to create WDS with. &quot; [1]</p><p>I did get 40 Mhz channels working, [2] says &quot;Edit the file /etc/config/wireless, and restart&quot; but doesn&#039;t say how to edit the config and [3] says &quot;Below config &#039;wifi-device&#039; &#039;radio0&#039; add (...)&quot;, but I just have config interfaces loopback, lan, wan and a switch in the config of my wr841nd, the WR1043ND has it.</p><p>I&#039;ve just added the line from [3] in my WR1043ND config file and executed &quot;uci set wireless.radio0.noscan=1&quot; on the WR841ND and now it&#039;s working.

					<p>Did you try the advice on the WDS wiki page? I guess your both devices are Atheros-based, so this is probably the correct method.<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds</a></p><p>I have WNDR3800 and 3700 in WDS config, and you only need a few modifications, otherwise the routers&#039; configs are identical. My discussion on config can be found at: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=186066#p186066">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 66#p186066</a></p>									</div>
