					<p>This has to be a question that has been asked before however a search of the forum doesn&#039;t throw up a solution.....</p><p>It also has to be something that a number of people would benefit from if there is a straighforward solution.</p><p>In a nutshell I have a valid and legitimate account with a Service Provider who has UK hotspots.</p><p>Their methodology for login takes two forms....</p><p>1.&nbsp; If logging in via a phone/tablet device they have an App that seems to respond to https requests and passes a username/password string.</p><p>2.&nbsp; If logging in via laptop/phone/tablet browser you are presented with a standard https login challenge page.</p><p>Now what I want to do is use my openwrt router when I&#039;m on the road to extend the range of my devices, so if I&#039;m staying let&#039;s say in a hotel on the edge of acceptable coverage for my laptop it&#039;s likely that my tablet and phone won&#039;t be able to login as they have lower power output.</p><p>So, get my router to login to the hotspot and then my devices login to the router and the router acts as a bridge/range extender.</p><p>Here&#039;s the thing......</p><p>When I try to access the hotspot from my router in client mode it never even gets an IP address, so is something happening before the https stream?</p><p>I would have thought this could be script driven without too much difficulty, but surely it&#039;s been worked on before?</p><p>Help!! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>You can write a login script using curl (probably specific for each hotspot), it is a fine tool, quite easy to use and with a whole lot of documentation and example, it can simulate browser behaviour such as login, bidding to ebay, etc. BUT you should have ip adrdress asigned to be able to connect to https login page, if this does not work, the scrpt won&#039;t too.</p>									</div>

					<p>Did you ever get a response? I have a similar issue in that some hotspots require acceptance of their terms. ANy smartphone will just redirect to a browser but openwrt does not have that. In some cases I can connect and I can use any device connected to openwrt to accept but some hotspots just won&#039;t let openwrt connect at all.</p><p>If only I could configure openwrt to act as a regular laptop: get a connection (and IP) and then authenticate...</p><p>H</p>									</div>

					<p>The wan interface needs to be<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;set to dhcp client<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;NOT a bridge<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;connected ONLY to your wifi client interface that will connect to the AP.&nbsp; Move any ethernets to the lan side.<br />The lan needs to be a different IP subent than the one the AP will give you.</p><p>You need to see a wan IP on the main status page before you can access any web pages on their login server.</p><p>If all that is OK, you should be able to wget or curl the login page.&nbsp; Since they are using https you need to install the full version of wget or curl.&nbsp; The little built in Busybox wget does not handle secure connections.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 21 Apr 2015, 04:10)</p>
