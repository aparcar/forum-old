					<p>I&#039;ve bricked my WDR3600 by powercycling it, so I&#039;m trying to recover it now.</p><p>I&#039;ve soldered a header onto the serial ports, but the pinouts are not as shown on the WDR4300 wiki page, i.e. instead of (from pin 1 to 4) TX, RX, GND, VCC, it&#039;s GND, VCC, RX, TX.&nbsp; Using the new pinout, I&#039;m able to get something resembling normal serial output, with fragments of words like &quot;ERRJ?&quot;, &quot;???ress&quot;, &quot;WASP&quot;, &quot;Au?K??tinJ??1 se??&quot;, &quot;eth&quot; and so on. I&#039;m also able to view the text I&#039;ve entered into the serial console without any corruption.</p><p>Is it possible that the flash or something is fried, resulting in this? If so, is it possible to somehow recover then?</p>									</div>
