					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve been working with OpenWRT on the TP-Link TL-WR-1043ND (v1 and v2) for a few months now.<br />At first I only used it because the wi-fi is way more stable when using multiple ap&#039;s(when compared to original firmware).</p><p>Now I&#039;m playing around a bit with VLAN&#039;s.<br />My goal is to separate my guest wi-fi network from my own network, to prevent my guests from using my Chromcast, NAS, smart tv etc, and ofcourse also to prevent them from accessing my other devices.</p><p>This is my set up:<br />I have a cable router in bridged mode connect to the WAN port of my main router(a TP-Link TL-WR1043ND V2).<br />The LAN-ports of this router are connected to the following devices:<br />1: Synology NAS<br />2: second router(TP-Link TL-WR-1043ND V2 connected lan&lt;-&gt;lan)<br />3: third router(TP-Link TL-WR-1043ND V1 connected lan&lt;-&gt;lan)*<br />4: solarpanel system(for monitoring)</p><p>On the routers, which are configured as AP, I have ofcourse disabled the DHCP server. This has been working/stable since I set this up.</p><p>I started following the guide on the wiki to set up a 2nd SSID on my main router. I also went through the steps to separate my guest network from my private network and I succeeded doing so(wasn&#039;t hard at all). When connected to my own network everything works like it worked before. When connected to the guest SSID I can only connect to the internet.</p><p>Next up I tried to add the guest SSID to my v1 router(which is closest to my desktop), including setting up the VLAN&#039;s. For the time being I shut down my other router to make sure it&#039;s not interfering.</p><p>The problem is as follows:<br />I am unable to get an IP address from my main router, unable to connect to any of my routers to be precise. This happens right after my final step(disabling the DHCP server on my AP). I am able to reach the GUI of my AP again after I&#039;ve set up a static IP address in windows. Still not able to reach the other AP though.</p><p>I tried a couple of things:<br />- Adding rules to the firewall<br />- Adding a gateway IP-address in the interface of my AP<br />- Adding a DNS IP-Address in the interface of my AP<br />- disabling/enabling the firewall on the AP</p><p>None of these things worked.</p><p>I have my VLAN&#039;s configured as follows:</p><p>Main router:<br />VID&nbsp; -&nbsp; CPU&nbsp; -&nbsp; Port 1&nbsp; -&nbsp; Port 2&nbsp; -&nbsp; Port 3&nbsp; -&nbsp; Port 4&nbsp; -&nbsp; Port 5&nbsp; -&nbsp; Port 6<br />1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;tag&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;unt&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;tag&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; unt&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;unt&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; off&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;off<br />2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;off&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; off&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; off&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; off&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; off&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; unt&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;unt<br />3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;tag&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;off&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;tag&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; off&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; off&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;off&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;off</p><p>AP:<br />VID&nbsp; -&nbsp; Port 0&nbsp; -&nbsp; Port 1&nbsp; -&nbsp; Port 2&nbsp; -&nbsp; Port 3&nbsp; -&nbsp; Port 4&nbsp; -&nbsp; CPU<br />1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;off&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;unt&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; unt&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;unt&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tag&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;tag<br />3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;off&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;off&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; off&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; off&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;tag&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;tag</p><p>I use Luci btw, since I&#039;m not an expert. I used Putty to do a few simple tasks but it&#039;s way more work for me and less easy to keep overview of my settings. Thing is I can&#039;t find a guide for Luci, regarding VLAN&#039;s and guest SSID&#039;s. Well actually i found one, only to find out I did everything they described.</p><p>Hope anyone can help, if you need more information just let me know!</p><p>Regards, Kevin</p>									</div>

					<p>Once you have the main router set up to provide a main and guest network to its two local AP interfaces, your firewall etc setup is complete.&nbsp; You need to bridge the two networks out to the interconnecting cable using VLANs, and have the AP router bridge wifi users back to those in a completely dumb way.</p><p>You appear to have the switches set up correctly.&nbsp; Note that the v1 and v2 have a different switching arrangement.&nbsp; Be sure that the cable is plugged into the proper port.&nbsp; You should see the connection status icon on the switch page change as you plug and unplug it.&nbsp; On the main router you need to add eth1.3 into the guest network.&nbsp; eth1.1 should already be in the regular lan network.</p><p>The &#039;lan&#039; network on the AP is part of the lan on the main router.&nbsp; It is connected to eth1.1 so it goes back to VLAN 1 on the main router.&nbsp; Give it a static address so you can access luci or ssh.&nbsp; The gateway and dns are the main router, this lets the OS on the AP access the internet to set the clock and download any package you may want to install later.&nbsp; Turn off the DHCP server.&nbsp; All routing and DHCP will be done by the main router.&nbsp; This means, as you found, that if the main router is down or disconnected, you will need to configure your PC to a static IP to be able to log into the AP box.</p><p>The &#039;guest&#039; network on the AP is going to be simply a layer 2 bridge between eth1.3 and its guest AP wireless interface.&nbsp; Make a new network &#039;guest&#039; and under physical settings, check bridge and select those two interfaces.&nbsp; You do not need to configure it with any IP addresses.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks mk24! It worked!<br />The issue was caused by the main router(v2).<br />By default it adds the VLAN&#039;s as eth0.x to the list where you can bridge interfaces.</p><p>The problem is that I use the VLAN&#039;s only for internal traffic. The LAN-ports on a v2 are on eth1 instead of eth0. I manually added eth1.1 to the LAN interface and eth1.3 to the guest interface and that fixed the problem.</p><p>Thanks for your quick reply!</p>									</div>
