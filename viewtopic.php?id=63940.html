					<p>Hello, I have two TP-Link TL-WR842ND routers running OpenWrt Chaos Calmer and they are separated by about 100m.&nbsp; One is repeating the other.&nbsp; I would like to configure them so that they are optimized for low latency applications. (In particular, online gaming)&nbsp; I know wireless connections aren&#039;t great for this application but this is currently the only option I have.</p><p>What I would like to know is: (1) what metrics should I be optimizing for this? and (2) What OpenWrt utilities should I use to monitor the values for these metrics?&nbsp; For example, right now with a default /etc/config/wireless configuration the ping time between thw two routers is about 2.5ms.</p>									</div>

It&#039;s the induced delay/lag that crops up when there&#039;s high traffic - even momentary - on your bottleneck link (generally, your connection to your service provider).</p><p>Fortunately, the SQM-QoS package of OpenWrt holds latency to very low levels even under very heavy traffic loads. (If you&#039;re not controlling latency via SQM-QoS, lag can get very high - 2 or more seconds(!))</p><p>To install and configure SQM-QoS, read the Howto at: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/sqm">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/sqm</a></p>									</div>
