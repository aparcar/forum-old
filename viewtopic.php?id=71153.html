					<p>It&#039;s not quite clear if you mean 6-7 MByte/s or 6-7 MBit/s, which -with a factor of 8- would be quite a different, but you have to keep in mind that the tl-wr841nd (and there are multiple quite different hardware versions involved there as well) is a pretty low end device, while VPN is CPU intensive. You can&#039;t expect that much from such a low end device.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have the same issue with openvpn server, same device.<br />Even when being connected with RJ45 via WAN the bandwidth drops from several MB/s to 2-8 Mbit/s with lots of packet loss as soon as I start some form of transfer.<br />Tested via iperf to a server and the router itself, after aborting all other transfers.</p><p>Is OpenVPN simply too demanding for this machine?</p>									</div>
