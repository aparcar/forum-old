					<p>Hi all ,<br />anybody out there who are familiar with makefiles ?<br />sorry for asking ,&nbsp; if i for example write in the makefile for a package the following lines&nbsp; :<br />$(eval $(call BuildPackage,bridge))<br />the binaries will be automatically stripped before they are packed in to the *.ipk package , <br />so my question is&nbsp; how can i disable the stripping of the binaries before they go into the *.ipk package ?<br />i know , itÂ´s a little bit crazy question , the reason for this question is , i am working on a package source of a library , everything is compiled right , and before the libraries go in to the *.ipk package , they are automatically stripped , i don&#039;t want that , because after stripping my libraries are destroyed , strip removes too much code , anybody know how to disable stripping ?</p><p>thank you for reading this <br />Have a nice day</p>									</div>
