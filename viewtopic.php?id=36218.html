					<p>3zl I did do LOTS of searching and already looked in the trunks builds and couldn&#039;t find anything which is why I started the post. I&#039;m not trying to create &quot;noise&quot; I just want to know why that router&#039;s firmware was not on the openwrt site. I didn&#039;t understand why if you can build the file then why can&#039;t they upload it to the site for everyone to use. I guess it&#039;s not fully supported yet.

You need to calm down and stop overreacting. I&#039;m not expecting anything or demanding anything from anyone. I never said they should build for all targets or build anything at all. I asked a simple question of why the firmware isn&#039;t available on the site for download. If it&#039;s because it&#039;s not fully supported yet then that&#039;s all you had to say. And why do I have to be familiar with linux to use openwrt? Why is that a requirement? Do I have to be familiar with linux to use dd-wrt since it&#039;s based on linux also? You&#039;re making some nonsense comments that aren&#039;t helping anyone.</p>									</div>
