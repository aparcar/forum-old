					<p>Hi</p><p>My issue is essentially this:</p><p>I have a WRT54GS v1.1 and a DSL modem.&nbsp; If I assign a static address to eth0.1, I can easily reach my DSL modem&#039;s web server from the LAN side of the router.&nbsp; But if that same port is configured as PPPoE, I&#039;m no longer able to reach it at that IP address.&nbsp; I understand why this is.</p><p>I was reading an old thread about this.&nbsp; If I just &quot;ifconfig eth0.1 192.168.2.1&quot; (the modem&#039;s IP is 192.168.2.254) while the PPP connection is up, I&#039;m able to telnet to the modem while logged into the router.&nbsp; I&#039;m *not* able to reach this address from the LAN side.</p><p>So the question:</p><p>Can I configure eth0.1 in such a way that PPPoE will still work as expected *and* I&#039;m able to reach the modem&#039;s web server from the LAN side of the router?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>I was able to allow access to my modem by logging into my router via ssh and modifying /lib/firewall/uci_firewall.sh</p><p>adding these lines before load_policy() {</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#IP Address of the modem, must be a different network from your local LAN.
#If you use 192.168.x.x for LAN then use 10.0.0.x for modem, etc (basically, pick a free IANA reserved range)
#Obviously you need to configure the actual DSL modem to use the address you select in MODEM_IP.
MODEM_IP=&quot;192.168.1.1&quot;
 
#IP address that will be bound to vlan1, usually safe to just increment MODEM_IP by 1.
VLAN_IP=&quot;192.168.1.2&quot;
 
#Setup network interface and firewall rules.
ifconfig eth0.1 $VLAN_IP netmask 255.255.255.0

iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -d $MODEM_IP -j MASQUERADE</code></pre></div><p>I took that from the old whiterussian method though i had to modiy the aforementioned file instead of putting that as /etc/rc.d/S52modemroute as when the router restarted or i changed some settings then access was lost, i&#039;ve yet to test this more thoroughly but it should load every time the router starts</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>CyberAxe</strong> on 11 Oct 2009, 03:33)</p>
