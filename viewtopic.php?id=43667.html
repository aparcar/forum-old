					<p>short version:<br />When copying many MP3s to router USB using Samba device locks up. <br />When playing MP3 from the samba share it will also lock up.<br />SSH, HTTP interfaces inaccessible in both cases, but router will continue to route internet traffic. </p><p>long version:<br />tl-wr703n (32mb ram)<br />samba 3.6 <br />OPENWRT BB r36xxx<br />EXTROOT on 32gb microSD&nbsp; (500mb root ext4/ 30gb storage ext4/ 1gb swap)</p><p>from what i gather before it crashes on WRITE, cpu use is about 75%, but the memory use shows 128%? <br />file copy is about 6mbs peak, 3.5mb/s avg. I am using it as a WIFI &quot;media&quot; server, that is, MP3 dump for my android phone. (video is probaby out of the question) . It may also be used as a&nbsp; ethn (lan) passthrough (wireless bridge, so I can access the internet through the same connection)</p><p>WOULD I GET BETTER RESULTS WITH, FTP OR NFS, or am I simply asking too much of this device??</p><br /><p>*note I did search this but the only info was from 2007-2009 using white russian*</p>									</div>
