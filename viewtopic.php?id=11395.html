					<p>Hi,</p><p>I cannot change any of NVRAM variables using SSH which confuses me. If I have all ports in same vlan and want to separate them in two, let&#039;s say to make dmz or to have one port in vlan with wifi, and all others in separate vlan I do trivial nvram commands which can be found all around Internet and after that make: nvram commit. Or I want to disable DHCP on LAN or WAN or anything like that....</p><p>After that (making change) nothing is happening. Even after reboot everyting is like before. Just to mention all commands I enter went ok, with no errors.</p><p>Now, I feel very stupid and think it is somethiing trivial, but no chance to find solution.</p><p>Is there any step I forget to do before changing nvram parameters, or something like that?</p><p>Anything else is fine, using linux commands always successfull, with no errors or problems, just NVRAM variables......</p><p>Can someone help me with this?</p><p>Next is there any chance to list just one nvram parameter, not listing all the configuration? If I do:<br />nvram show&nbsp; - I have all configuration listed<br />Now, I would like to see something like lan_ipaddr or lan_dhcp_enabled or .... I don&#039;t want to go through all configuration I want listed just this parameter.... it would be nice to have it like<br />nvram show lan_dhcp_enabled<br />but, when I print something like this it has no errors and list hole configuration again.... which is stupid, or it&#039;s me..... HELP ?</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>L.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you try something simple like &quot;nvram set test=123&quot; and then &quot;nvram get test&quot;, does it work ok? If you commit and reboot, does it work?</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, now I don&#039;t know what to say. I successeded using your commands. <br />nvram set test=123<br />nvram get test<br />123<br />but, allow me to say that is not ok enough when I do<br />nvram unset test<br />I have no answer, which is ok, but is not OK, when I do<br />nvram get test<br />to have no answer that there is no such variable, too.... system is have taken that command like nothing happened.... it should say that there is no test variable set....</p><p>Now, I am convinced that I made some mistakes when saying that my NVRAM commands doesn&#039;t effect the system...they oviously does..... after making &quot;your test&quot;</p><p>I need, to double check it again and maybe reply again... if I don&#039;t successed...</p><p>Thank you once more time.</p><p>L.</p>									</div>
