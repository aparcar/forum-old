					<p>I am hoping someone can help me with what is hopefully a very silly error on my part. I&#039;ve had to swap from Gargoyle as my wireless performance was terrible and I was only getting 50% of my max connection speed on a wired connection. In gargoyle I was able to simply set up a rule to block outoging dns requests for a range of ip addresses (i.e. force them to use the routers dns server). I cant seem to get the syntax correct in the firewall rules in openwrt. I have the following section in the firewall config file</p><p>config rule<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; option src &#039;lan&#039;<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; option dest &#039;wan&#039;<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; option name &#039;BlockDNS&#039;<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; option extra &#039;-m iprange --src-range 192.168.xx.3-192.168.xx.16&#039;<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; option src_port &#039;53&#039;<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; option dest_port &#039;53&#039;<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; option target &#039;DROP&#039;</p><p>But when I restart the firewall from a terminal prompt I get the following error message - </p><p>(null) v6: iprange: Bad value for &quot;--src-range&quot; option: &quot;192.168.xx.3&quot;</p><p>(Just to confirm - the xx is replaced with the subnet of my router in the config file)</p><p>Can anyone point out my mistake?<br/>Thanks<br/>Roger.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rwbarrett</strong> on 8 Jun 2014, 15:31)</p>
