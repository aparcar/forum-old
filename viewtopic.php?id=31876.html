					<p>I&#039;m trying to install OpenWRT in a TP-Link TL-WR743ND.</p><p>I&#039;ve downloaded OpenWrt Buildroot and applied the patch available at <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/10057">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/10057</a></p><p>The patch applied cleanly.</p><p>I expected to see a &quot;TP-LINK TL-WR743ND&quot; target profile to choose inside &quot;make menuconfig&quot; but there was none so I choose &quot;TP-LINK TL-WR741ND v1&quot;.</p><p>The compiling process produced a &quot;openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr741nd-v1-squashfs-factory.bin&quot; file. When I tried to upgrade the router firmware via web I got the following error message:</p><p>&quot;Error code: 18005<br />[18:03:38]&nbsp; &nbsp; Upgrade unsuccessfully because the version of the upgraded file was incorrect. Please check the file name.&quot;</p><p>Any ideas on how to proceed and/or further debug this issue?</p>									</div>

					<p>There should be a profile called TP-LINK TL-WR743ND v1 if the patch was applied properly. Check your target/linux/ar71xx/generic/profiles/tp-link.mk for the following entry:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>define Profile/TLWR743NDV1

					<p>My &quot;target/linux/ar71xx/generic/profiles/tp-link.mk&quot; was already ok but I had no TL-WR743ND available inside &quot;make menuconfig&quot;.</p><p>I&#039;ve just tried running &quot;make distclean; make menuconfig&quot; and I finally got the TL-WR743ND target option inside &quot;make menuconfig&quot;. I believe the problem was that I runned &quot;make menuconfig&quot; once before applying the 743 patch.</p><p>I will recompile everything again and will report back.</p><p>Thanks for your help MBS.</p>									</div>
