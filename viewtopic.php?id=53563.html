					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have been trying to fit a VPN solution (openVPN or Stormswan), batman-adv and tc onto a WDR841.&nbsp; I am very close to meeting the flash size requirements (I think).&nbsp; To further shrink the image I would like to deselect some default packages such as opkg.&nbsp; From within menuconfig I can deselect the package (for example base system -&gt; opkg) but the package still seems to be build and included.&nbsp; This seems to be because there is an entry in .config CONFIG_DEFAULT_opkg=y which overrides # CONFIG_PACKAGE_opkg is not set. </p><p>It looks like these default packages are select by the target but I cannot find where in the build tree.&nbsp; I could edit the .config file by hand however the file clearly says Do not edit <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I recognize that these packages may be set as default for a purpose, and that these packages may be too small to matter,&nbsp; but I would still like to experiment.&nbsp; Can someone point me to how I can unselect default packages?</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sailor_ca</strong> on 23 Oct 2014, 18:12)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the quick reply.&nbsp; I have searched the dependences under ./bin/ar71xx/packages but I cannot find anything that depends on opkg (Depends: lines in ./bin/ar71xx/packages/*/Packages). Also, my assumption was that if I could deselect the package in menuconfig then it was not required by another package.</p><p>Also,<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>donald@sailorca:~/Development/bb-14.07$ grep -i opkg .config
CONFIG_DEFAULT_opkg=y
CONFIG_OPKGSMIME_PASSPHRASE=y
# CONFIG_PACKAGE_opkg is not set
# CONFIG_PACKAGE_opkg-smime is not set</code></pre></div><p>Is there somewhere else I can search to find dependencies of&nbsp; all packages without going through each package directory individually?</p><p>Thanks again.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sailor_ca</strong> on 23 Oct 2014, 18:44)</p>

					<p>I quite possibly am an idiot.&nbsp; I just reran my tests and opkg is NOT in the packages directory after rebuilding after a make clean <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>
