					<p>Hi.</p><p>I have a few switches and several APs around a big building. I have set up OpenWRT as dumb ap, but also with two plans and two SSID. A few of them works fine, but some are breaking my whole network.</p><p>Almost as if they were taking over the role of DHCP servers or something like that. The moment I unplug them network gets back to normal.</p><p>Any ideas?</p>									</div>

					<p>Looks like you did not configure it as a real &quot;dumb AP&quot;, and it is still acting as a DHCP server.</p>									</div>

					<p>Make VLANs in the switch set every one to &quot;tagged&quot; on both the trunk ethernet cable and the CPU port.<br />Make a separate bridge interface for each VLAN.<br />The VLAN that you want to be able to log into the router for administration can be the original &quot;lan&quot;.&nbsp; It should have a static IP that does not conflict with anything and DHCP server turned off both v4 and v6.<br />The ones that are going to be completely dumb bridges from wired to wifi can be set with protocol &quot;Unmanaged&quot; or None. <br />In each bridge, have the corresponding wifi AP and one of the eth0.x ethernets.<br />Do <em>not</em> connect anything to eth0 by itself.&nbsp; Always specify the VLAN.</p><p>Suggest making a temporary AP that is in the LAN bridge for doing this setup.&nbsp; This way if you lose connection by Ethernet you can still log in on wifi.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 18 Jul 2017, 21:51)</p>
