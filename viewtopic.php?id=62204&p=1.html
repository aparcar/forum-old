					<p>I really liked bole5&#039;s dnsmasq-based adblocking script for its elegance and simplicity, but I wanted more features, so I&#039;ve used his as a base to create my own.<br/>Features:<br/>- Supports Attitude Adjustment, Chaos Calmer, Designated Driver<br/>- Doesn&#039;t stay in memory -- creates the list of blocked domains and then uses DNSMASQ and firewall to redirect requests to a 1x1 transparent gif served with uhttpd<br/>- Supports both hosts files and list of domains for blocking<br/>- Supports remote whitelist URLs, just put whitelisted domains one per line<br/>- Supports whitelisted domains in config file<br/>- Uses ufetch-client on DD instead of wget<br/>- As some of the standard lists URLs are using https, requires either wget/libopenssl (AA, CC) or ustream-ssl (DD)<br/>- Has setup function which installs dependencies and configures everything (/etc/init.d/adblock setup)<br/>- Has update function which downloads updated script version from github.com (/etc/init.d/adblock update)<br/>- Has verbosity settings (adblock.config.verbosity, default value 2) controlling output verbosity<br/>- Very lightweight, the whole script is just one /etc/init.d/adblock file<br/>- Logs single entry in the system log with the number of blocked domains if verbosity is set to 0<br/>- Shows ad blocking status in the banner (can be disabled)</p><p>The setup script also installs the proper sort binary instead of using busybox which should speed things up.</p><p>Everything is available at <a href="https://github.com/stangri/openwrt-simple-adblock">https://github.com/stangri/openwrt-simple-adblock</a> and feel free to fork/submit pull requests or use in your own build.</p><p>I&#039;m only using this in my custom builds, but it should work on a stock OpenWrt image (let me know if you try and it doesn&#039;t). It *requires* uhttpd and installs coreutils-sort and either wget/libopenssl (AA, CC) or libustream-polarssl (DD).</p><p>For more details check out the github page and script sources.</p><p>Again, all the credit goes to bole5, I&#039;ve just slightly improved on his work and made a one-line installer. Now that it&#039;s on github people can contribute to the script easier. Would be great if someone volunteers to make this into a package. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink"/></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stangri</strong> on 4 Apr 2016, 01:46)</p>

					<p>Thanks for prompt reply.</p><p>Reflecting on your earlier message -- did you delete /etc/config/adblock manually before running adblock-update.sh?</p><p>If so, best way to proceed would be to do:<br/></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/etc/init.d/adblock update
/etc/init.d/adblock setup

					<p>Ok, thanks Stangri.&nbsp; Sorry for the late reply.&nbsp; That did fix the config file, but my poor old WNDR3700v1 is still running out of memory on at least some of the sorting steps and towards the end causes the router to lock up and reboot.&nbsp; It then gets in a loop until I can SSH in fast enough to disable adblock and stop the process.</p><p>I assume this is a case of needing to provide the router with some swap, due to lack of ram?</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for continuous feedback!</p><p>I think the default config is pretty modest with the lists it includes. The adblock-install.sh script at github has the list sizes in the comments, check them out and only enable the ones your router can handle.</p><p>It is unexpected to me that your router would lock up when running the script and running out of memory. I&#039;ve experimented with some rather large lists on mine and they were just causing the script to end prematurely. Also, when the router restarts, the actual downloading/sorting doesn&#039;t begin until about a minute after start-up. So there&#039;s still time to issue uci commands.</p><p>I should consider NOT enabling adblock service by default tho. I&#039;ll make updates next time I&#039;m editing.</p>									</div>
