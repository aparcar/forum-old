					<p>Good day,</p><p>I&#039;m battling with my WRT54G v2 since 6 weeks to get it work again. History:</p><p>. WhiteRussian 0.9 working well since february, previous versions also<br />. july 2007: I saw Kamikaze 7.06 and gave it a try. No more wireless. Didn&#039;t do anything more, going for holidays<br />. august 2007, 2 days ago (end of holidays :-(): I saw 7.07 and install it. Wireless came back but unstable:<br />&nbsp; - only working few minutes and then very slow, even POP clients can&#039;t take mails (Timeout).<br />&nbsp; - ping is ok<br />&nbsp; - mtr is ok<br />&nbsp; - ssh to the WRT54G and then launching top: sometimes immediately, sometimes after 4~5 refresh -&gt; blocked, CTRL/C does nothing<br />&nbsp; - http: same, blocked.<br />&nbsp; - running down/up iface or renewing IP address make everything working as it should, but the problem will appear again within the same delay<br />. came back to WR 0.9 and ... still have the same wireless problem</p><p>I tested with 3 laptops, I tested those laptops against others WIFI Router: they are ok. Distrib are Debian/SID (ipw3945), Xubuntu 7.04 (ndiswrapper and bcm43xx), Ubuntu 7.04 (ndiswrapper and bcm43xx). Wired connection works perfectly. I removed iptables, WAN port is used as a 5 LAN port.</p><p>To summarize: had WR0.9 working smoothly, tested K7.06 (no WIFI) &amp; K7.07 (WIFI unstable), came back to WR0.9 (still unstable WIFI). What can be wrong? Any help or hint greatly appreciated.</p><p>-- <br />Daniel</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the trick. At this moment *without having doing something else* than rebooting few times the WRT54G, 2 of 3 notebooks have the WIFI connection back! I think your manipulation will have good effects as soon as I will launch the script.</p><p>Again, many thanks for your help.</p>									</div>
