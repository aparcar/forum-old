					<p>Hello,</p><p>I would like to disable ACKs on MAC Layer for a Wireless Network in order to check the new performance. I am using OpernWRT backfire 10.03 and my wireless drivers are ath5k. </p><p>Is there any terminal command to do the job. For example you can disable rts by typing iwconfig wlan0 rts off. Is there anything equivalent for disabling MAC ACKs? If not, is there any other way to do this.</p><p>I would also like to disable the re-transmission mechanism. On ubuntu this can be done be typing iwconfig wlan0 retry 0, but iwconfig for OpenWRT does not support the retry option. Is there any other way to do that? </p><p>Any help appreciated. Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>I did a quick research but bear in mind</p><p>- 10.03.x is unsupported<br />- you probably want to check the driver / sourcecode if retries are used in that driver or are even exposed as configurable option<br />- OpenWrt uses patches and drivers &quot;from the future&quot; (no in Kernel; but mac80211 package from 2011-12-01 which uses some development repos)</p><p>- is the removal happening in wireless-tools (does 003 patch remove that functionality; see <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/branches/backfire/package/wireless-tools/patches">here</a>)<br />- can retries be manipulated by driver?</p><p>see <a href="http://wireless.kernel.org/en/developers/Documentation/mac80211/RateControl/minstrel#Retry_Chain">http://wireless.kernel.org/en/developer … etry_Chain</a><br />Rate Control Algorithms may have intrinsic properties/values that are used<br />see old stuff @<a href="http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-wireless/msg63947.html">http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-wire … 63947.html</a> - an ath5k entry on a subsystem mailing list</p><br /><p>for current info:<br />iwconfig is considered deprecated</p><p>use iw instead<br />example:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iw phy phy0 info

					<p>zloop,</p><p>Thank you very much for your reply. I was actually trying to avoid tuning the drivers source code.</p><p>I tried iw but it doesn&#039;t seem to support the retry option. <br />Do you think that it is a good idea to remove ath5k and install ath9k?

					<p>zloop, </p><p>One more thing.. I have done some research and I haven&#039;t found anything about iw supporting the retry option. It is not even on the man page of iw. I even tried it on my laptop (Ubuntu 12.04) but it is not supported. I guess it should be &quot;activated&quot; as I am able to tune the retries with iwconfig, ie my laptop wifi driver supports retry tuning. Am I doing something wrong? </p><p>Thank in advance</p>									</div>

					<p>ath9k only works with 9k chips.&nbsp; You may get more (or at least different) options on 5k hardware by using the old madwifi driver instead.</p>									</div>

					<p>did have a look at iw:<br />- iw supports the retry setting since 03/2014 </p><p>&gt; However, it doesn&#039;t seem to work. Any ideas why?</p><p>- ath5k is not ath9k<br />- retries might not be exposed / depends on driver /madwifi or ath5k<br />- As stated before: the algorithm involved in rate control might be responsible (minstrel)</p>									</div>
