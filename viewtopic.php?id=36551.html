					<p>Thanks for the idea! <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The site explains blacklisting specific countries. Which could be a solution to my problem.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Originally I would like to do the inverse, and if possible keep the web IF configuration as well... Do you think it is possible to do a &quot;complex pre-filtering&quot; before the web UI filters get evaluated?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Do you think worth keeping WEBUI configuration and adding additional &quot;complex pre-filtering&quot; rules, or just use iptables -F <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> in firewall.user?</p><p>Tanks, </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Attila</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for all of your ideas! I have succeeded in restricting access to a range of IP addresses. In case someone wants to do the country based filtering, the code below for firewall.user solved my issue <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> ...</p><p>Unfortunately there is a small glitch left in the filter <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> , as I did not really understood the FORWARD concept.</p><p>Here&#039;s the problem:<br />I am running transmission on a laptop machine connected to my router. <br />Opening a&nbsp; <em>zone_wan_forward</em> port to <em>--dport 51413</em> enables transmission up/dowload on the laptop (and transmission diagnostics reports port open)<br />As soon as I enable <em>zone_wan</em> filters by IPrange, all packet that does not match&nbsp; <em>zone_wan</em> filters are dropped (however I thought they would pass because of the forwarding rule) Transmission diagnostics reports port closed.</p><p> Syslog says the dropped packet&#039;s destination is the router, not the laptop behind it. The forwarding rule did not change.</p><p>What cause this behavior? How could I do a work-around?</p><br /><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
