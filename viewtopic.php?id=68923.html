					<p>this issue persist on me on Atheros based wifi chipset but not on realtek, ralink and broadcom.</p><p>the only fix that I can think is to flash back to OEM firmware or any firmware that doesnt use hostapd.</p><p>I had the same issue on certain device deauth it self for no reason even if that device is always active like a wireless internet radio that I had, it always cuts the stream every 1 hour or so.</p>									</div>

					<p>this is what i was afraid to hear. It does look like there is no fix to it as i have read countless threads and there was no definitive solution to the issue.</p><p>I guess I will go back to DD-WRT</p>									</div>
