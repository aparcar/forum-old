					<p>Is there any reason why coova-chilli is dropped from packages in the latest trunk? <br />It is still there in the final Altitude, but gone from Barrier.</p><p>Chillispot is still there, but to be honest, if a package should be dropped it should be chillispot, not coova. Chilli has not been maintained since 2006, whereas its replacement coova is still maintained at this moment, and has been updated with IPv6, WISPr and more, so is very much alive.</p>									</div>

					<p>If that&#039;s true, I think it warrants further investigation. Maybe contact the package maintainer? It might be undergoing some work before it&#039;s put back in. It&#039;s trunk after all, so maybe someone has plans for Coova.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well yes, but there is no specific maintainer listed. </p><p>Your take on it is positive, that someone may be doing work and dropped it tempoirary. I worry that it simply stopped compiling, and without a maintainer to check it out, it was simply dropped.</p><p>Lets hope you are correct and it appears again later. For now I&#039;ll stick to Backfire I guess. (Altitude has some other issues for me)</p>									</div>
