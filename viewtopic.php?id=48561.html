					<p>I use Linux on several systems.<br />I have a Pelican PL-3669 XBox wireless access thingy.<br />Supposedly the 3669 is the same as ZCom XG-1020.<br />Neither company lists firmware.</p><p>I can connect to the 3669 via my laptop (Kubuntu 13.10) using the laptop wired ethernet port.<br />When I login, I click the wireless settings in the original firmware.<br />I see the screen first load one way (call this version 1), then pop, it changes to a second screen that only allows configuring the device as an access point (screen version 2). If I am quick enough, and only when I use Firefox, I can stop that page load at a certain point (at version 1), and there, I see there is an ability to change the device to any of 4 modes, Bridge, Access Point, and whatnot. Problem is, this version 1 screen isn&#039;t going to reconfigure the 3669 in that mode, as when I click the apply button, the screen returns to version 2.</p><p>According to one Youtube video (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hDdvh3htoY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hDdvh3htoY</a>), this device is the same as a ZCom XG-1020, which device offers those options which the Pelican screen version 2 is not allowing.</p><p>I see this issue as a firmware option. ZCom no longer lists the XG1020, so I don&#039;t think I can get that firmware.<br />Pelican doesn&#039;t offer a firmware update, and probably wouldn&#039;t offer a firmware that gives the user features that aren&#039;t documented.</p><p>The wiki seems to say OpenWRT offers support for the ZCom XG-1020&#039;s chipset.<br />I have updated networking firmware correctly a few times before.<br />I have compiled once before. And that compiling was successful.<br />I have telnetted about a thousand times to remote servers, I can probably get into the PL-3669.</p><p>I do not mind that the hardware is limited to Gplus, my intended use is to allow cellphones to get a wireless data connection in a home that only has wired ethernet - plug the 3669 into a wired port on their non-wifi router, and use the 3669 to provide data to the cellphones via wireless. You know, those pesky cellphones have no hardwire ethernet ports. The device isn&#039;t doing anything right now, and if I&#039;m not mistaken, the XBox 360 could still use the device after a firmware adds missing features.</p><p>Anyone think this is sensible device to put OpenWRT onto?</p>									</div>

					<p>Worst thing that can happen is that you learn that it doesn&#039;t work, and if you know how to revert back to original firmware you have nothing to loose. Go for it.</p>									</div>
