					<p>Hi All,</p><p>Many thanks everyone for sharing solutions. That is a great help!<br />I currently have 2 x HT-TM2&#039;s. One with original firmware and one with openWRT. I wanted to use the original one when travelling. I notice that quite often wifi is weak and available only by&nbsp; hotel room door or window. This is where I would place HT - TM2 with battery and create my own SSID. I noted that for some reason sensitivity on Hootoo firmware is lower than on OpenWRT - 9 SSIDs vs 15 SSIDs respectively. Is there any mod that could improve reception? I quite like simplicity and reliability of Hootoo firmware and the only thing I would like to improve is router ability to receive weaker signals.</p><p>OpenWRT is fantastic piece of firmware but i have a few problems with it. I have been trying to auto mount various usb stics and hdds (ntfs, ext4, exfat) but with no success.
