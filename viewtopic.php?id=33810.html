					<p>I have a WNDR3700v2 running DD-WRT, <strong>with the Open-WRT Backfire optware packages via opkg.</strong><br />Currently I have the usb port connected to a 4 port USB hub and attached to that is a 4gb flash drive, and two 1tb Seagate drives in a individual-detect JBOD enclosure. Rather than just switching on spanning on the JBOD I would like to mirror the two drives for backup purposes.</p><p>I have about 100gb of music, and 3 separate pc&#039;s which operating system and user files total around 400gb (leaving pleaty of room in a 1tb raid 1 for incremental backup solutions for each computer as well as a solid backup of the music.) The two 1tb drives are currently not formatted since the original plan was to use mdadm to create a software raid 1 volume. As it appears both OpenWRT and DD-WRT&#039;s kernels come without the md.ko and the individual raid driver modules built. Is there a simpler software solution, or is my best bet to download the development toolchain for the ar71xx and compile the mdadm kernel modules from source and insmod them manually? I know with older router hardware, mdadm may have been just a bit of a stretch, and nearly unusable due to processor limitations, but seeing as my router&#039;s 700mhz chip sits at a .5-.1 load average across the board, and memory usage is under 5% - I think I can go ahead and run mdadm without causing too much stress. </p><br /><p>Could I possibly setup a crontab to run a script like this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>umount /mnt/volume1
umount /mnt/volume2
dd if=/dev/sdb1 of=/dev/sdc1</code></pre></div><p>After the backups complete? (Presumably I could check this just by having the backup script create a volume.lock file and removing it after the backups have completed.)</p><p>Unfortunately although I believe the above is probably possible it would greatly reduce the lifetime of the storage drives since the dd command would read and write both free and non free space, as well as force the spindle to be operational for an extended period of time (instead of spinning down when not in use, which would be the majority of the time in this environment ideally)</p><p>I know, open-wrt isn&#039;t dd-wrt, however this forum is generally more knowledgeable and I may be switching to open-wrt depending on the answer to my question</p><p>Anyways, thanks in advance!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>xaero252</strong> on 1 Jan 2012, 10:18)</p>

You can look detail in datasheet for your HDD, but usually MTBF for spinning but idle drive is about 300000 hours yet MTBF for spin-up/spin-down cycles is about 50000. This means that for typical HDD single spin-down/spin-up cycle is more-or-less identical to six hours of work (YMMV - you&#039;ll need to look in your HDD datasheet).</p>									</div>
