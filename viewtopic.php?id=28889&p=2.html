However, I came from a TP-Link TL-WR1043ND less than a year ago where I had to do with 8MB of storage. Got a Buffalo WZR-HP-AG300H last year with a whopping 32MB of storage. Now this Mikrotik beauty has 128MB of storage. Even after installing Python on it I still have only 30% usage, so I am hard pressed putting additional storage to good use. I already have a USB-disk I will use for file-sharing and back-up.</p><p>BTW, I noticed the wget2nand script does not clean up the rootfs.tgz file. I will try to find time to submit a patch for it, but in the mean time you can free up (in my case where I compiled in a lot the file is just over 10MB) some storage on the nand by deleting it. You will find it in the root folder I believe ( that is / and not /root, sorry for the ambiguity).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Del</strong> on 9 Jan 2013, 14:01)</p>

Compile your own image. If you like I can guide you through a manual install (i.e., doing the wget2nand operations manually with local files). It is basically just to copy two files over.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>renne wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>But at 30 MByte/s speed with Samba (limit of my USB-stick)</p></blockquote></div><p>Indeed. You can try to share the /dev /shm folder. It is a ramdisk linux creates upon boot that can hold up to half of your ram in storage. It should remove any bottleneck and enable maxing out the samba speed available.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>renne wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I&#039;m interested in using the SD-card as NAS storage.

					<p>Did some digging on the missing luci-app-openvpn package. There already is a ticket on it:<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/12331">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/12331</a><br />so I built the package by exposing broken packages in make menuconfig and installed it. I did a search on all tickets reported on the package to look for hints as to why it is marked broken. Found one fixed issue:<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/10473#comment:2">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/10473#comment:2</a><br />found one issue that made no sense to me:<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/8843#comment:2">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/8843#comment:2</a><br />that leaves only three issues I haven&#039;t looked closer at:<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/11190">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/11190</a><br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/11222">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/11222</a><br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/11975">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/11975</a></p><p>Seems this is easier than I feared, unless there is something escaping me. Guess this is getting off topic, so I will follow up this one in ticket 12331.</p><p>On topic, I found documentation on the sysupgrade: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.sysupgrade">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.sysupgrade</a> seems there is quite a bit of documentation available for making an installable image. Submitted a patch for the wget2nand issue, it was quicker than creating a ticket.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Del</strong> on 9 Jan 2013, 21:13)</p>

Just ssh into the router, then you can collect installed packages with:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>opkg list-installed | awk &#039;{print $1}&#039; &gt; /tmp/installed-packages</code></pre></div><p>you can roll them back in with<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cat /tmp/installed-packages|xargs opkg install</code></pre></div>									</div>
