					<p>First of all, I realize most of the developers probably stay clear of the forum, but in case anybody should see this: Thanks for yet another great release with BB today!</p><p>Having just updated to BB and enabled my ISP&#039;s IPv6 trial offering, I have some questions:<br /></p><ul><li><p>I haven&#039;t configured anything with regards to IPv6, and my ISP isn&#039;t giving out any details of what they provide, except they say &quot;the addresses are not static&quot;. My LAN side clients (both ethernet and WiFi) get IPv6 addresses out of the box from OpenWRT, and these work fine. They also seem to be on the same /64 subnet. The WAN address of the OpenWRT box, however, seems to be on a completely different subnet (a /128 at that). Is this normal? What&#039;s the technical term here? </p></li><li><p>Under &quot;DHCP and DNS&quot; in LuCI only one specific client shows up under &quot;Active DHCPv6&quot; leases. It is an ethernet client. Other ethernet *and* WiFi clients, some with the same OS, do not show up here, but do show up under &quot;Active DHCP leases&quot;. Everybody gets an address (both v4 and v6) and things work just fine, but I&#039;m confused. What am I missing here? What can be so special about this one client that shows up (with a sub-half-hour lease, by the way)? </p></li><li><p>How can I forward everything from wan6 to lan, without forwarding the IPv4 WAN traffic? </p></li></ul><p>Thanks for any pointers.</p>									</div>

Your wan and lan interfaces are connected to different links and thus have different prefixes, it&#039;s basically the same as with IPv4 just that with v6 your lan-side also gets public addresses. Your ISP routes a so-called &quot;delegated prefix&quot; to you so you can hand out public addresses to your clients. If it wouldn&#039;t we would be back in NAT-land.</p><br /><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Under &quot;DHCP and DNS&quot; in LuCI only one specific client shows up under &quot;Active DHCPv6&quot; leases.

I wouldn&#039;t expect that to happen with devices of the same OS. Which one is it btw.?<br />The lease-time for IPv6 is capped at a portion of the address lifetime your ISP announces. So if your ISP announces your delegated prefix with low lifetimes this propagates down to your clients, not much you can do about it.</p><br /><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>How can I forward everything from wan6 to lan, without forwarding the IPv4 WAN traffic?</p></blockquote></div><p>See some examples at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/firewall#port.forwarding.for.ipv6">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/firewal … g.for.ipv6</a></p>									</div>
