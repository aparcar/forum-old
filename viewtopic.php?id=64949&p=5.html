					<p><strong>@anomeome</strong> may be right, as I&#039;m trying several crypto modules to see what sticks. I want to achieve something similar to the post #5 here --&gt; <a href="https://airvpn.org/topic/11827-routers-with-aes-256-cbc-acceleration/.">https://airvpn.org/topic/11827-routers- … leration/.</a> I&#039;m not really sure which kmod crypto modules are need to take advantage of Cryptographic Hardware Accelerators on the WRT1900ACS. Eventually, I would like to max out the performance of openssl. According to the wiki here --&gt; <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/cryptographic.hardware.accelerators,">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/c … elerators,</a> there should be a device <strong>/dev/crypto</strong> which is being used by crypto apps like openssl to achieve higher performance. For that to happen, we need the cryptodev-linux module which includes kmod-crypto-core and kmod-cryptodev. Additionally, from what I understood, we need to add libopenssl to /dev/crypto for openssl to take advantage of the hardware. Finally, on the wiki there is a section about Marvell CESA, which I believe is what&#039;s need for the WRT1900ACx series.</p><p><strong>@davidc502</strong>, anything I attempt to install from here --&gt; <a href="http://davidc502sis.dynamic-dns.net/snapshots/targets/mvebu/generic/packages/">http://davidc502sis.dynamic-dns.net/sna … /packages/</a> seems to be giving me the <em>satisfy_dependencies_for</em> error.</p><p>An openssl bechmark yields the following:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@lede:~# openssl speed -evp aes-256-cbc

					<p>Since it has the latest wireless driver, I&#039;m trying this build on the WRT1900ACS v2. So far, so good for the most part. The GUI definitely seems a lot faster and more responsive. Wireless and wireline communications are fine. So far, the things that I&#039;ve configured (dynamic DNS and static DHCP leases) are fine. I have not encountered the delay with the radios. I did notice my wireless throughput is difference. On kaloz&#039;s latest build, I was around 280Mbps on an 802.11n link. On this build, I&#039;m around 260Mbps. Not enough to care about (for me) but interesting.</p>									</div>
