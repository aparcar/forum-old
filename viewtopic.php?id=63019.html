					<p>Hey there kind people of the OpenWRT Forum, i&#039;m quite new here so I would just need some help from someone to check this firmware for me for any malware or adware to steal and use my internet traffic data. Here is the story.</p><p>I bought a new router after my old one (DIR-615) died after 5 years of service. After that i went and got myself&nbsp; TL-WR1043ND Wifi router and set it up to my countries ISP custom firmware and its great and all, working fine but the only downside was that its range was quite bad in the next few rooms ,So i got myself a TL-WA850RE Range extender that was ridiculously unstable even when using the LAN port connected my PC. After that i figured that I should give OpenWRT a try before going with my ISP&#039;s advice to get a second access point (TL-WA901ND). So I tried and failed to many times to get the whole system up and running with the aid of general online guides that were not product specific. Then i found this awesome guy on YouTube ( <a href="https://goo.gl/sM2dRP">https://goo.gl/sM2dRP</a> ) and he made a custom firmware for my device and then gave it to me along with 2 videos just for me on how to get the whole thing working. So it works and all is well my range extender is (hopefully) more stable running his firmware than TP-Links stock firmware. </p><p>So then my parents asked me, why would a random stranger on the net help you with a problem that he has nothing to do with and asked me to post his firmware on a forum and check if it is bugged to steal data. I would absolutely love it if someone could tell me if it is safe to use this firmware. Thanks in advance.</p><p>Firmware Download : <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2SiPtGSfzDFSjVqQjRpRllPRVU/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2SiPt â€¦ sp=sharing</a> <br />Virus Check : <a href="https://goo.gl/bzgyHo">https://goo.gl/bzgyHo</a></p><p>EDIT 1 : I will post a full documentation and tutorial (Thanks to Tammy and Keith McKenzie) on what I did and how I set up the Range Extender by next week, after my exams are over.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Open Letter To Tammy and Keith McKenzie, The kind person(s) who help me sort out this whole conundrum.
