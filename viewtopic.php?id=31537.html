					<p>Hello</p><p>I have the following problem.<br />I have done download tests (with backfire 10.3 rc4 on NS2) i.e. downloaded a big file in /tmp<br />It seems that if /tmp is about 50% full the system locks up.<br />After a time of 2min after locking there is a write failed: Broken pipe error message and ssh<br />connection is closed. Login again works<br />But if fs is 60% full login fails the system will reboot and of course the files is away.</p><p>More bad if you are not in /tmp i.e. in /root which is the overlay fs<br />If this is full the system locks up and even reboot will not help because the fille of course resist there in.<br />So you are f... up and need to reinstall the whole system...<br />ping doe still work but login with ssh is not possible (because of no diskspace?)</p><p>So my question is why ssh (dropbear) or kernel&nbsp; needs space in the overlay fs for a new connection<br />if there is no swap space?<br />BTW: I have compiled own version of openwrt but don&#039;t think this make any difference</p><p>Noticed also that writting to overlay fs is very very slow (140kbps) Is this normal?</p><p>Any hints solutions to prevent this lockup for dummy users???</p>									</div>
