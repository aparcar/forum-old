					<p>Hi, I&#039;m using rsync in combination with ssh to make backups to my 1tb usb drive connected to openwrt box (wr1043nd). I&#039;d like to give rsync possibility to a friend too, but I don&#039;t know, how to set permission for foreign user, so he won&#039;t be able to read/write to /tmp or another router&#039;s folders which don&#039;t belong to him. Ideally they should be completly hidden from the user.</p><p>For me it works fine, but third party could accidently write to /tmp (and fill ram of the router) or to my samba shares, if he knew the path (because I needed to chmod them 777 to be able to write via samba). I can tell him just to stay away from other folders, but he can catch a virus and someone else could then hijack my router, so I&#039;d like to make this secure.</p><p>How can I achieve this? Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 20 Mar 2015, 17:09)</p>
