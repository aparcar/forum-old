					<p>I had to use the ping_times hack to set the boot_wait variable. You can follow the instructions here: <a href="http://www.seattlewireless.net/index.cgi/LinksysWrt54g#head-63778907ad8cc001c80abec29165f6c31ff70bce">http://www.seattlewireless.net/index.cg â€¦ c31ff70bce</a></p><p>Also, to go back to Linksys firmware you need to download it from the Linksys website. I haven&#039;t tried this yet but I *assume* it is the same procedure using tftp. Someone else here may want to step in who has tried it. Personally, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever go back.</p>									</div>

					<p>I too just purchased a WRT54G v4.&nbsp; After trying a few of the ping hacks and ended up using the Linksys interface to get OpenWrt on.&nbsp; The first thing I did after a reboot (and as per the OpenWrt&#039;s Wiki) was to set boot_wait.&nbsp; From there I&#039;ve only fiddle-dinked around and did a test reflash (tftp) to see if boot_wait was set correctly.&nbsp; It was.&nbsp; I did reflash the Linksys firmware (tftp) and noticed that Linksys changed boot_wait back as I couln&#039;t re-reflash OpenWrt.&nbsp; So, yes, with my WRT54G V4 I had to (twice) use the Linksys interface to get another firware on.</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>									</div>

My guess is that it may be validating that before getting to the ping_times variable. If it does not validate, the rest of the script does not execute.</p>									</div>
