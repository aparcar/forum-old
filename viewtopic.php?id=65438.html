					<p>So OpenWRT seems to be dead. Is there a guide how we migrate to LEDE? Is a sysupgrade working from any trunk build of OpenWRT? Are all configs compatible with LEDE? Are there all oldPackages from OpenWRT be included?</p>									</div>

					<p>Funny you should say that, because just yesterday a new OpenWrt trunk build was uploaded (r49379).</p><p>Migration instructions might depend on your specific router model, but you should be able to flash factory/sysupgrade image (I&#039;ve only tried it without preserving settings).</p><p>You&#039;re unlikely to discover any difference between the two for now.</p>									</div>

Using highly offensive terms like reboot is the way to go to make friends. The future is whining about how they were mistreated and how evil everyone sticking with openwrt is.</p><p>I feel sorry for rmilecki who was intent to make a proper getaway, ie maintain stable till someone else steps up or a reasonable amount of time has passed, but then gets caught in the political mess some exponents caused for petty reasons. I&#039;m also perfectly fine with nbd basically stating he will fix what he messed up but otherwise will only contribute to lede (that&#039;s how I read his last commit).</p><p>Also fun to watch are some exponents not being able to fathom that no one is begging on it&#039;s knees for reunion.</p><p>About the domain, sure some are bitter that they weren&#039;t able to take the domain with them. However no worry, it&#039;s pretty much guaranteed the domain won&#039;t be abandoned and openwrt will continue to exist.</p><p>As for the codebase, there are plenty regressions for my particular device, as such openwrt trunk is in better shape than lede for now.</p><p>As long as you create a separate topic I personally don&#039;t mind you discussing lede here, I also don&#039;t see why asking for help migrating would be rude, offtopic likely yes and it goes to show ledes infrastructure is not yet on par. What I find asine is hijacking threads left and right or recommending lede to people which obviously should use a stable build, be it openwrt, dd-wrt or even debian.</p><br /><p>@knuddel<br />Migrating is basically the same as updating your openwrt trunk build. So the same level of caution applies. The packages feed on github is shared for now as are the other openwrt hosted projects like procd and so forth.</p><p>As to whether openwrt is dead, the current silence was to be expected. However, it doesn&#039;t look like lede is able to get out of the identity crisis any time soon and as such I don&#039;t see a point in waiting any longer to resume operation. As such I also feel a clear statement is due.</p>									</div>

					<p>wtf. you can make your own firmware build but you cant even manage to get yourself migrated on another build, LEDE is just basically a OpenWRT using Trunk image with only just fairly updated packages, thats all.</p>									</div>
