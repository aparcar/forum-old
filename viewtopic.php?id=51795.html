					<p>I am having a confusing problem that I hope will be easy to resolve. I&#039;m running AA on my TL-WR703N and I would like to use it as an mpd/mpc player. </p><p>To that end, I&#039;ve gotten a <a href="http://www.dx.com/p/3-in-1-sd-tf-card-reader-usb-fm-transmitter-white-200805#.U9BeWv6347w">USB FM Transmitter/card reader</a> and it works great. I put in an SD card for storage and the transmitter shows up as a USB sound card.</p><p>The problem I&#039;m encountering is that I can only get to the wifi interface if the wired interface is plugged in first. I&#039;ve read a bunch of different articles about making the wifi part a client but none of them seem to work. I must need to do something with the firewall since if I start pinging the wifi IP, I end up with a lot of &quot;Destination Host Unreachable&quot; until the wired interface is plugged in. After that, everything is copacetic, sort of. If I unplug the wired interface it goes back to &quot;Destination Host Unreachable&quot; unless I &quot;Stop&quot; the wired interface in the web interface. </p><p>I have a BB version that allows me to do this (but it&#039;s for usbip playing around), and I&#039;ve compared the two of them but I&#039;m just not seeing a significant difference. Is there some documentation on the best way to do this somewhere? Or am I missing something really simple?</p><p>Thank you<br />James</p>									</div>

					<p>Not enough information, It seems that you have to set up an static IP on your wifi interface so it will stay up, but without knowing what you are connecting to (does it has a DHCP server?), how you set up you wifi interface, and so on everything will be a guess.</p>									</div>

					<p>It actually doesn&#039;t matter if the wifi interface has a DHCP address or static address. The result is the same. I can watch my DHCP server for the wifi interface to ask for an IP address without the wired interface connected, but I still can&#039;t connect to the wifi interface.</p><p>I thought that it might make things easier if I gave the wifi interface a static address instead. </p><p>I&#039;m connecting to a WPA2 shared secret wifi.</p><p>Both interfaces are connected to the same network (is that what you&#039;re asking?). My device does not have the DHCP server running. </p><p>What other information can I provide?</p><p>James</p>									</div>

					<p>I hope someone can show me to be wrong, but in my experience, wifi and wired have to be on separate nets with openWrt.&nbsp; For instance, with a WR703N as a client, I set a wifi ap of 192.168.1.20, and for managing with a cable direct to my laptop, a wired ip of 192.168.0.20.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lizby</strong> on 24 Jul 2014, 16:10)</p>
