					<p>The 8.09 release is not currently useable on the DIR-300 and similar routers because it is missing the switch configuration fix ticket #4050.</p><p>There is a patch at <a href="http://dev.luci.freifunk-halle.net/freifunk-snapshots/_patches/atheros-buildroot.patch">http://dev.luci.freifunk-halle.net/frei â€¦ root.patch</a><br />(link found in another thread).</p><p>I have tried to apply the above patch to the 8.09 release, but the compile of the kernel hangs (not completed in 8 hours): <br />make[3] -C target/linux compile</p><p>What is really needed is a version of 8.09 with the relevant fixes from the trunk incorporated into it.<br />r15305 is the original merge of the ticket response.<br />r15307 may be relevant<br />r15308 is a tidy up.<br />r15315 may or may not be relevant.<br />r15329 adds default uci configuration<br />r15331 enables swconfig by default</p><p>One possibility is to take r15331 from trunk and build it, hoping that other work on trunk has not made it unstable at that point.</p><p>Is there any chance that someone would be able to merge the switch fix into 8.09?</p>									</div>
