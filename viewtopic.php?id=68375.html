					<p>Hey everyone,</p><p>I have been working on communicating with a modem with both RS232 to USB &amp; RS485 to USB converters. The package kmod-usb-serial-ftdi was enough to communicate with the Rs232 converter, but the Rs485 still does not work. </p><p>When I use &quot;lsusb&quot; I notice the Product ID and Vendor ID are the same for both converters, the full output is &quot;Bus 001 Device 019: ID 0403:6001 Future Technology Devices Internal, Ltd FT232 USB-Serial (UART) IC. </p><p>So, are there separate driver&#039;s needed for RS485 vs. RS232 converters? They are both authentic FTDI converters from USBconverters.com. Any suggestions?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
