					<p>Hello there.</p><p>Iv had experience with virtual servers and website design and coding but this appears to be a WHOLE new level/setup.</p><p>Iv read the Openwrt guides and it just makes thing even more confusing, as the guide jumps right in with the assumption the individual knows the basics already... Also the way things are explained are less difficult than they are written....<br />An example: &quot;device right width selected&quot; . simplified - &quot;highlight text&quot;... and when you have references to previous systems and setups it confuses me even more... which is not difficult to do at the best of times <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> <br />..............................................................................................................<br />Basically on each instruction page and setup guide it writes things similar to...<br />suppose you want to change the device&#039;s IP address from the default 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.2.1. To do this, using any text editor, such as vi, change the line </p><p> option ipaddr&nbsp; &nbsp; 192.168.1.1</p><p>in the file /etc/config/network to:</p><p>option ipaddr&nbsp; &nbsp; 192.168.2.1</p><p>Next, commit the settings by running /etc/init.d/network restart </p><p>...................................................................................................................</p><p>Ok now please advise me, where is this file directory that is being branched off ? ...../etc/itit.d/network ? </p><p>I keep seeing references to access and modify &quot;files&quot; with an extension but no information as to how you can get there.<br />I tried using <a href="http://192.168.1.1/root/etc/config">http://192.168.1.1/root/etc/config</a> .... but i get sent to the login page. How is everyone accessing these individual file locations. I assumed it would be mentioned in the &quot;getting started, or configuration&quot; pages.<br />I have Putty and WinSCP, but then i read dropbear can be used instead? its all so very confusing and before i go running off editing and saving config files i need to find them first. </p><p>So for someone who knows nothing about Linux systems, and is a complete newby - where do i start in order to access individual config files?</p><br /><p>I basically just want to set up router Logging - Using a 120GB external memory stick to run a proxy program from</p><p>Iv installed tinyproxy then it crashed and i reset openwrt to a new clean install, then installed polipo and Tinyproxy - i will remove one once i figure out which is best.</p><p>Iv already read a few tutorials, and managed to name all the hosts on the network and give them static IP leases so i can identify the computer. </p><p>Iv downloaded/installed the required USB modules, but now i need to access the drive. Any assistance for this simple mind would be greatly appreciated...</p><br /><p>Cheers <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>exposeclothing</strong> on 1 Oct 2015, 15:26)</p>

					<p>OpenWRT is a mini linux system... so you really need to deal with basic linux remote access to get to those files you&#039;re talking about. If you&#039;re on Windows then Putty and telnet are your friends. I&#039;m sure in the getting started documentation there is a note about after you first flash you&#039;ll need to Telnet to the router, set yourself a root password, and reboot. After you do that, SSH should be enabled.</p><p>Putty is an SSH client, so you use it to connect from Windows to the SSH server (called Dropbear on OpenWRT). Once you connect, you login there and can then access files, make changes, etc from the linux command line.</p>									</div>

					<p>I agree.&nbsp; In general this product EXPECTS that you have a GOOD working knowledge of Linux, and the documentation is not very helpful to most Windows users.&nbsp; The package system is a great concept, but there is no information other than a cryptic sentence on what a package does.&nbsp; There is no list of prerequisites, which is mostly needed to calculate size for device storage.&nbsp; There are a lot of functions that the device can do, but it&#039;s not documented.&nbsp; Search with Google for outside threads.</p><p>All the config files you need are in one folder \etc\config\&nbsp; Yes, there are other places that you will find and eventually maintain (hack), but this is the brunt of it.</p><p>Regarding USB, make sure you have these installed:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>USB Packages

					<p>Thanks so much for the responses. </p><p>I have downloaded and installed all the usb required software for mounting etc but i figured before i go ahead, the most important avenue is obtaining access to the file directory.</p><p>I have Putty, and winSCP <br />use all the log in details <br />IP: 192.196.1.1&nbsp; port 22 username &quot;root&quot; password &quot;entered password&quot;</p><p>And the connection times out, so i figured i need to download some kind of server to receive these connection requests but the guides all assume i have access to the files.</p><p>I like the concept behind WinSCP, especially the split screen file directory, it seems perfect for all uses but iv tried to login to the router with the same details above<br />but again it times out. I checked to make sure that (in the backoffice using luci interface, in the &quot;administration&quot; option that says SHH / DROPBEAR, i checked the port number was the same) and it was and that all incoming, outgoing options were selected and that all interfaces where being listened to. </p><p>i checked out the logs and noted it said that port 22 was in use, so i changed it to port 23, aswell as in the connection using winSCP and it just times out looking for a host. I tried it with SCP SFTP, FTP, WEBDAV, all connections fail. I found even using the FTP configuration while connecting the error says &quot;you are trying to connect using Sftp where as the server accepts FTP, would you like to try using FTP? ... i click ok, nothing happens</p><p>I assumed perhaps its a firewall error, so i checked out windows firewall, i added putty, winSCP applications to the firewall exceptions, and nothing changed.<br />I managed to connect using Putty once, i didnt change any settings, just wanted to connect again using the saved settings and it timed out. </p><p>from reading, it seems i need to create a proxy server to connect to, or through? (according to the winSCP site as to why i receive the errors)</p><p>is it possible that its a windows 8.1 issue, as iv noticed iv had issues with doing EVERYTHING i used to do on my old windows 7 laptop.</p>									</div>
