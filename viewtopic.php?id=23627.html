					<p>I&#039;m working on a device that uses the broadcom 5354 chip, and have just recieved a new driver package from broadcom. This includes the binary driver, and source for wl. I&#039;d like to speak to the individual(s) responsible for porting the original 4.150.10.15 driver and the work they did to help me integrate the new driver into my build. If anyone has any information or words of wisdom, I&#039;m open to listening.</p><p>Thanks..</p>									</div>
