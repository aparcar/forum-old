					<p>So I&#039;ve set boot_wait and tftp&#039;ed over the b3 bin to my WRT54G.&nbsp; Everything ran as planned, but how do I return the original bin? I&#039;ve tftp&#039;ed the file over successfully but it doesn&#039;t work. I didn&#039;t see anything posted on it in for forums. I&#039;ve tried to access the web controls and it gives me an operation timed out error. I&#039;ve tried to &quot;reset&quot; it but it still does the same thing. I&#039;ve tried the tftp a few times just in case, but I&#039;ve gotten the same results. Any suggestions. Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>I noticed this question was never answer but in hopes that someone will provide some insight I would like to ask the same question.&nbsp; I have the current openwrt binary flashed to my wrt54gs but would like to return to the original factory rom.&nbsp; I thought that was possible but thus far I&#039;ve have no luck doing so.&nbsp; Can anyone please steer me in the right direction</p><p>TIA<br />Bill</p>									</div>
