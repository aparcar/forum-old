					<p>Can&#039;t exactly remember what I did.<br />I installed freifunk-*.ipk then modified /etc/init.d/S... scripts Freifunk (webadmin, olsrd and dnsmasq packages) installs.<br />But were some stupid things (like adding in S45firewall &quot;sleep 2&quot; between the FAILSAFE and /proc/net/wireless check, to give time to the wl driver to load...I suppose...it work for me; I also deleted some links in /etc/ to point them to /var/etc instead of /rom/etc).</p><p>Anyway, if you ( and anyone) need it, send to me a PM with your email and I&#039;ll send to you the ipkg I made to install our mesh nodes. The ipkg is made to work on RC4 and has all the freifunk-*.ipk contents inside, with my mods and some of our crap (nodes text db).<br />When you install it, you get a working Freifunk node.</p><p>Then you can create diffs. Can&#039;t do the diffs now beacouse I don&#039;t have neither a wrt running Freifunk nor a spare wrt to get it.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Wallace</p>									</div>
