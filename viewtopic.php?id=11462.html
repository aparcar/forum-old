					<p>I got so anoyed with DD-WRT and was so restrictive, now DD-WRT is fine for normal use but if you like things a bit spicier then OpenWRT is the way to go! It works perfect and is solid and easily customisable, the filesystem is just great. I LOVE THIS OS. :3D</p><p>I plan to to create some script modifications on this box, however i need to roll out these scripts to many boxes (yes ive picked OpenWRT for the project :3D) and i dont want to add these to each one it would be nice if i could flash a custom image.</p><p>How hard would it be to create such a custom image? I will look on the wiki for instructions, but im interested to know if it is a nightmare and would be easier to simply flash the standard image and put the scripts on manually (after all i will need to telnet into each unit to set specific usernames , passwords and ip addresses etc).</p><p>Thanks for the help.</p><p>Chris</p>									</div>
