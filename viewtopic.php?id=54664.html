					<p>I have Attitude Adjustment running on a TL-WDR3600. Once in a while I have problems connecting my macbook or my android phone to the network. The device takes a long time and then gets a self assigned ip address 169.254.xx.xx and has no connection to the internet.</p><p>This is not a continuous problem, right now the connection seems perfect. The problem occurs at unpredictable intervalls, restarting the router often helps, but minutes later the connection can drop again.</p><p>I upgraded to Barrier Breaker, but now I have the same problem when connecting the macbook by lan to the router.</p><p>I have no idea where to look for a solution. Is this a configuration problem, a hardware problem, anything else?</p><p>I&#039;m thankful for every helping hint.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ah, the logs. (I&#039;m quite new to all this, so please excuse my noob questions.)</p><p>I thought of that as well, but I didn&#039;t find any logs. Now I did some more reading and as a result I added these last two lines to my /etc/config/system:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config system
    option hostname &#039;OpenWrt&#039;
    option timezone &#039;UTC&#039;
&gt;    option log_type &#039;circular&#039;
&gt;    option log_size 16</code></pre></div><p>Then I restarted the router and wanted to read the new logs. But when I issued &quot;logreader&quot;, the answer was </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>-ash: logreader: not found</code></pre></div><p>Where do I have to go next?</p>									</div>
