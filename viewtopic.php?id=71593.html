					<p>Hello,</p><p>I want to create a mini-distribution for MIPS or ARM based low-RAM low-ROM devices based on FreeBSD. It will be like pfsense. I will provide a way people to use FreeBSD&#039;s features without knowing much about FreeBSD. Still they will be able to reach the command line if they want to.</p><p>Plans:<br />-Use geom_uzip file-system. And a minimal file-system for ports that can be installed later.<br />-Fork existing BSDBox in progress and code the rest after I finish reading, if the release is not come by then.<br />-Use LibreSSL and OpenSSH and not to use Dropbear and OpenSSL.<br />-No IPTables, no ipfw, just PF.<br />-Precompiled packages. Download and install. May be compiled and added to geom_uzip if know-how.<br />-Will build with this flags: <a href="https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/15969/#post-92975">https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/15969/#post-92975</a> or maybe some extra without flags.<br />-lua language for web interface. i will learn it.<br />-In the future replace FreeBSD C library with minimalist subset. BSD Licenced.</p><p>My fundraiser: <a href="https://igg.me/at/vYz9moYDUT8">https://igg.me/at/vYz9moYDUT8</a> Would you please share it?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bagciozgur</strong> on 22 Jul 2017, 16:19)</p>
