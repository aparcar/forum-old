					<p>For this setup to work __without double NAT__, you need to be able to set a simple static route on the Fritz!Box. AFAIK on Fritz!OS this is possible without having to jump through hoops. Search in the forum for something like &quot;double NAT&quot;.</p><p>DHCP over more broadcast domains should work, since it sends 255.255.255.255 on all interfaces it serves as dhcp server. So then via DHCP the FritzBox should tell the hosts what nameserver to use etc.</p><p>If this does not work, simply do it all static and turn the services (daemons) on the OpenWrt-device off.</p><p>Traffic shaping is by nature &quot;transparent&quot;. All traffic passes the txqueue and you &quot;simply&quot; apply some fancy algorithms as managers of the txqueue.</p>									</div>

You should be able to connect from the OpenWrt-device but not from devices behind it! For this to be possible, the NAT-solution on the Fritz!OS needs static routes, so it correctly NATs the packets from the hosts behind the OpenWrt-device to their IP addresses (which belong to a different subnet then the net between Fritz and OpenWrt).</p>									</div>

					<p>With &quot;transparent shaping&quot; I meant it would not add extra DHCP, NAT, etc. to my network.</p><p>My current setup is like a line. All 1Gbit ethernet, the 2.4GHz wifi&#039;s share one SSID:</p><p>Fritz!Box 7360 (2.4GHz g/n) -- switch -- Airport Extreme (switch mode, 2.4GHz g/n, 5GHz n) --5 GHz WiFi-- Airport Express</p><p>Fritz!Box 7360 has native IPv4 &amp; IPv6. It NATs the IPv4, and blocks incoming IPv6 connections. IPv4 on the LAN is via DHCP, and IPv6 is &#039;auto configured&#039; according the standard (no DHCPv6).</p><p>A MythTV backend with a static IP is plugged into the modem (the other 1Gbit port). Remote frontends throughout the house can send Wake-on-LAN packets to the server if they want to watch TV. There is a printer which is auto discovered through Zeroconf/Bonjour and whatnot. I have Linux, Mac, Windows, iOS and Android machines on ethernet and WiFi. </p><p>I want to put a WDR4300 between the Fritz!Box and the switch, just to shape traffic to the internet. Maybe for wifi too in the future. Everything plugged in directly into the modem would move to the WDR4300 or further up the line.</p><p>Is there an explanation what &#039;static routes&#039; are supposed to do? It appears to me that in this case it would statically route IP packets between two LAN ports on the modem, that is not what I need. I don&#039;t think WOL (layer 2) goes through anything routed, even with static routes (layer 3), since it&#039;s sent to a MAC address. And neither would Zeroconf (also layer 2, or layer 3 multicast?). I do not want to change the IP address of the MythTV backend, as all clients are setup to connect to it and wake it up just fine, also on the machine multiple servers expect the static IP address.</p><p>---</p><p>I am just describing the behavior of the setup as described in post #1. Everything works on connected clients, they will get an IP from DHCP within Fritz!Box&#039;s ip range. I can telnet/ssh to the WDR4300, but cannot ping to google.com from there. A WDR4300 LAN-port connected Airport Extreme (to its WAN port, of course) will complain about it&#039;s network connection, and will use a self chosen IP.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried inserting extra DNS and gateway info for the static wan port, but it doesn&#039;t solve anything.</p><p>---</p><p>I did not try qos with the default OpenWRT NAT turned on. With the setup as described in post #1 I just use the standard &#039;qos-scripts&#039; from opkg which shapes the interface named &#039;wan&#039;. I suppose that&#039;s the same as &quot;OpenWRT-qos&quot;. Under load I saw packets being dropped from different queues via `tc -s -d qdisc` on the WDR4300 in the setup described in post #1. Also on my Fritz!Box the bandwidth graph drops lower if I set the &#039;upload&#039; value low enough in /etc/config/qos on the WDR4300.</p><p>---</p><p>With the Airports I can just flip on &quot;switch mode&quot; and everything works in my setup. They do not have fq_codel though. I understand setting up a Linux switch or router takes some extra knowledge, and I&#039;m willing to learn. I&#039;m educated in networking by Andy Tanenbaum.</p>									</div>
