If its been done well, my guess would be that the internal strip aerial has been cut.

I&#039;m no expert at these frequencies (2.4Ghz) though so cant comment on exactly what the effect will be.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey, </p><p>i have a Problem using the Pulseaudio Firmware (<a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=150597#p150597">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 97#p150597</a>)<br />it installes very well, but when i try to opkg update i get an error, that its not reacheble.<br />What i want is: <br />Pulseaudio, using extroot on an usb drive, and transmission running. so i have to install some other things - so i need opkg. Whats wrong there?</p><p>Is it possible to change the packages source in the opkg.conf to use the packages from the openwrt snapshot?

					<p>@Pcace:<br />Sorry for my misunderstanding.&nbsp; I am not sure why you don&#039;t have ip address when at bridge mode.&nbsp; Is your client network and the host network on the same subnet or different subnet?&nbsp; I am not that experienced on bridge mode either.&nbsp; However, as far as I know, Openwrt is not very friendly if both are on the same subnet.&nbsp; If they are on different subnet, I don&#039;t see why you don&#039;t have a real ip address of the router in client mode.&nbsp; Mine certainly did.<br />Maybe you should google more to to find out what others did.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>twinclouds</strong> on 3 May 2012, 13:06)</p>
