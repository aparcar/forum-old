					<p>I have successfully installed quagga + isisd on OpenWrt AA. The lack of documentation is a little problematic, but we can work on that. What I am puzzled about is whether support for IPV6 is compiled in, and how I enable that functionality. This is in an existing network, and routing of IPV4 and IPV6 should follow each other. I can set up interfaces, with the correct prefixes, but isisd &amp; zebra will not indicate any dynamic routes, only those set on the interfaces. Tcpdumping the isis traffic there are no TLVs for IPV6, only for IPV4 in the LSPs.</p><p>Anyone knowledgeable on the subject?</p><p>Gulweb</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gulweb</strong> on 22 Jan 2014, 14:49)</p>

					<p>Quagga on OpenWrt feels hard to get friends with. I have given up using isisd (*for now*), and have had to resort to ospf. However, this has up til now been unsuccesful. My config: zebra + ospfd. Running ospfd over ethernet is straightforward, and an adjacency is formed immediatel. However, the other link is a GRE tunnel. I can see hellos from both routers on both routers interfaces, so hellos reach the oposite system. The hellos look &quot;normal&quot; as compared with hellos over (working) ethernet, with the difference THAT THE MASK is 0.0.0.0 over the gre, but reflects the subnet mask on ethernet. Since GRE is pointopoint, that might be correct, but I have read up that ospf adjacensies will NOT form if the participating routers have different configurations, &quot;for&nbsp; example masks&quot;. So, the 0 mask might indicate something wrong, I have tried to set the GRE if addresses in a /30 subnet, and in a /32 subnet, but can see no difference in the HELLOs. </p><p>So, did you have any sucess running ospf over GRE tunnels? Does it indeed work/not work in Openwrt A.A? Comments and a discussion appreciated.</p><p>Gulweb</p>									</div>

					<p>Update:</p><p>Inspecting the hello messages I found that we had set the hello timer differently at the two ends. Adjusting that the OTHER end formed an adjacency, however my end ignores the messages. Right now the messages are identical, except that the other end claims my router ID as neighbor, but my system does nothing. Puzzled. And it seems everything must *match exactly*, even hello timers. However there seems no difference as seen with tcpdump.</p><p>Gulweb</p>									</div>
