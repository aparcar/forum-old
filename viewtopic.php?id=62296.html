					<p>Hello,<br />I tried to compile <a href="http://zbar.sourceforge.net/">ZBar</a> by my own and i think i almost got it but im just missing the experience about compiling OpenWrt packages and their makefile so i cannot get it to work. The problem is my company searches for a method to locate the position of it driveable system and it has to be cheap. Currently we are running an Raspberry Pi as an WLAN Client with the stable release of OpenWrt ChaosCalmer 15.05. The Raspberry Pi should be able to use a webcam so we want to use the ZBar package to scan QR-Codes on different positions of our system to locate our maschines. So i tried to compile ZBar for the newest OpenWrt trunk version but i was not able to scan any QR-Codes or imagefiles. I also got errors by trying to use the video function.All my experience about ZBar you can find here <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=61038">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=61038</a><br />We don´t find any other solution to fit our needings so we have to use that ZBar programm. ZBar currently running on other operating systems for the Raspberry Pi so it is possible to run this on the Pi.&nbsp; </p><p>So my question is, if there is anybody who can compile this package for OpenWrt for my company. It should work on the OpenWrt ChaosCalmer 15.05 release from 2015-09-11 for the Raspberry Pi B+ which you can find here:<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/raspberry_pi_foundation/raspberry_pi">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/raspberry_ … spberry_pi</a> <br />It should run on ChaosCalmer, because we have currently a running ChaosCalmer system which works as WLAN Client and we have implemented some other functions on it. Only if there is no way to get it to work on CC we can switch to a trunk version.&nbsp; &nbsp;My company is also able to pay for this work because we don´t have anybody who is that close to OpenWrt to do it for ourselves.<br />So when you know your able to get ZBar running on our system please contact me on this Forum for more conditions.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Nah i managed to compile this Software but it´s not working because im missing the last part of the Makefile. I got it to install but the functions of it are not working. I guess i used the wrong binarys and installation paths so ZBar was not able to use any of it´s functions. I asked if anybody knows which i have to use but got no answer and i didn´t found any soultuion by myself. the compile process was successful but ZBar can´t use any of it´s functions. It was able to call that functions but they all stopped with different Errors like not included Decoder(wich is a part of ZBar) or something like that. I posted everything on my old Topic but this is too deep for me actually. I don´t know which binarys i have to put in which folders and even where to find all those binarys.</p><p>greetings</p>									</div>
