					<p>Gabor is rocking on the AP81&#039;s lately!&nbsp; Despite this router having a difficult u-boot, OpenWRT trunk 14674 is now flashable and all devices should be in working order.&nbsp; TP-Link also released the source code for their u-boot in response to requests. </p><p>I&#039;d also like to point out that I suspect the earlier TP-Link TL-WR841ND model should be pretty easily adapted to OpenWRT now this work is done.&nbsp; Those models also use u-boot and are Atheros based.</p><p>There is a thread on the hardware forum where I wanted to discuss trying to solder in USB port on the unpopulated pads.&nbsp; it also has details on how to solder in serial port on this router, which is more difficult than most.&nbsp; See here: <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=82724">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=82724</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Anyone have good reports to share on flashing the new .uni format on a TP-Link?&nbsp; We had one failure report.</p><p>At this point, I encourage you to be prepared to have a serial port hookup until at least a couple users say it is working OK...</p>									</div>
