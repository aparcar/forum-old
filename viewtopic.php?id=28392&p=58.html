Ideally you also make it possible to set the FID via the Luci interface for the switch when changing the switch configuration but I&#039;m not capable of doing that :-)</p><p>Without this change to the way the switch is setup it is not possible to setup a bridged interface that is bridging two or more vlans. The reason why I wanted that is so that I can very easily capture all traffic going to a specific host connected to a port using tcpdump for debugging purposes. So now I can hookup a host to port 3 (as listed on the wndr3700 it self) and than it is considered as part of the LAN (so br-lan) and then run tcpdump -i eth0.2 to capture all trafic to that device only.</p><p>You could possibly also do that with filters on MAC or IP .. but this is a generic solution and can work with any host now.</p><p>I understood that using this setup makes the network throughput a bit slower .. but that does not matter to me now.</p><p>Kees D.</p>									</div>
