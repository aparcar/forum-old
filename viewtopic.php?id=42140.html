					<p>Well, Im not 100% sure if it has been bricked, but the power led blinks in a steady green. I have telnetted, SSH&#039;d and TFTP&#039;d the router and each time it &quot;SAID&quot; I was successful, but router still will not function. I cant even use it as a switch in its current state. I dont know much about router hardware, but would be willing to learn how to reflash using an USB-TTL cable if no-one can come up with a software resolution.</p><p>EDIT: The recovery utility also states that my router is working properly</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>downsouthrambo</strong> on 5 Feb 2013, 22:28)</p>
