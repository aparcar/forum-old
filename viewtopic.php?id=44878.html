					<p>I think that we could solder even a 64 MiB FLASH and if kernel supports the chip it will recognize it correctly. But probably we won&#039;t be able to use all available size, because the SPI has limited address space.</p><p>For now, in my opinion 16 MiB is the maximum size in single SPI chip for this platform, but I will be very glad if I&#039;m wrong.
