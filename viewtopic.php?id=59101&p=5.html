					<p>Thanks for the update.

By that I mean is it fairly robust, or is it down on the list in terms of processing power? </p><p>2. When I ssh to the box, I don&#039;t get a &#039;normal&#039; command line. I get something called ash and busybox... wtfo? </p><p>3. And finally, when I try to install wget from the webgui, I get this: </p><br /><p>Package wget (1.15-1) installed in root is up to date.<br />Configuring wget.</p><p>Collected errors:<br /> * pkg_run_script: package &quot;wget&quot; postinst script returned status 255.<br /> * opkg_configure: wget.postinst returned 255.</p><p>That doesn&#039;t smell like success... any thoughts on where I screwed up?</p></blockquote></div><p>For many use cases, the amount of computational power comes up when trying to run OpenVPN (encrypting/decrypting every packet).&nbsp; As such, I tend to use the openssl benchmarks created for OpenWRT</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/benchmark.openssl">http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/benchmark.openssl</a></p><p>The reports from the 6416 and hootoo (two similarly sized/priced travel routers) were done by yours truly.&nbsp; In rough numbers, the 6414 is about 2x the ancient (but still widely used) WRT54G, but only 10-20% as powerful as the top-of-the-line, multi-hundred dollar current offerings.</p><p>You should, however ask how much router do you want.&nbsp; Higher computational power requires more electrical energy, and sacrifices portability (not to mention more money).&nbsp; The next GL-iNET portable router will have higher specs for not much more cost, but isn&#039;t available yet.&nbsp; You can read through this thread (and the hootoo thread) to see what people are able to do with these small, cheap devices.&nbsp; Or you can post what you plan to do with it, and we can try to help.</p><p>As for your 3rd question, is your OpenWRT device connected to the internet?</p>									</div>
