					<p>Hi folks.&nbsp; I have built the latest OpenWrt from source using the instructions from <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27840">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27840</a>.&nbsp; I did this on my Debian PogoPlug and an Ubuntu 11.10 laptop.&nbsp; I was very surprised to see there is a 2k difference in file size in the resulting .bin files produced, and WinDiff suggests there is little common code between them.&nbsp; Now, I don&#039;t want to brick my router and in an attempt at avoiding that, I&#039;d like to know if there&#039;s any way to tell which of the files will likely do that.&nbsp; I usually use the laptop for all my development, but I thought I&#039;d have a go on the Pogoplug, and despite it taking considerably longer than my laptop, the build finished without error.&nbsp; The laptop is x86 and the PogoPlug is Arm, as I suspect that might be the reason, i.e. recreating the Arm toolchain on an Arm system...&nbsp; Hope there&#039;s someone out there who can give me some advice.&nbsp; Cheers.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mumblebore</strong> on 7 Jan 2012, 14:58)</p>
