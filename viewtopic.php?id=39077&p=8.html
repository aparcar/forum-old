					<p>This does that, and adds wifi support.<br />If you delete the wifi AP, it will be only a bridged wifi client, so you will connection in the LAN ports.<br />Then, you can connect a PLC on the LAN port, and the other PLC where you need.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dabyd64</strong> on 10 Dec 2014, 02:09)</p>

					<p>I have a strange problem with my router (Netgear WNR2000) which is running Mode 1 of this thread, repeating a WPA enterprise connection. Initially it worked for quite a few months, then it stopped working. Nothing had changed with the configs. I reinstalled, and it worked again for a few months. This time, after reinstalling, it works perfectly for only a few minutes and then limits the bandwidth to 128kbps. It is working in all other ways, except that bandwidth throttle. It picks up a decent signal (-70), has a tx of 19Mbps and rx of 39 Mbps (from station dump).</p><p>I just tried &quot;wifi down&quot; then &quot;wifi&quot; and even that removed the throttle - again, just for a few minutes. (Can be seen clearly in speedof.me)</p><p>Are there any ways I can try to diagnose the problem? Are there things I can post e.g &quot;df&quot; or the configs for anyone to have a look at?</p><p>UPDATE: This behaviour is not present when I used the router to repeat my mobile wifi. So it is specific to the enterprise network - it could be on the admin side.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nicklear9</strong> on 15 Dec 2014, 19:37)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the post, dabyd64.<br />I used mode #1 and it worked for my situation, and was much more concise than the howto found in the OpenWrt wiki.&nbsp; OpenWrt is so flexible, it&#039;s difficult for someone new to it to figure out which setup will work for a give use-case.</p><p>I have a couple of questions, but first let me describe my setup.<br />I have a Cisco router (with a wireless network) that is connected to my cable modem in one room of my house.<br />In another room, where my office is, I needed to connect an IP phone (that doesn&#039;t have wifi).&nbsp; Running a cable is not an option.<br />I bought a cheap TPLink router in the hopes I could use it to provide wireless connectivity for wired devices at my desk.<br />As I said, mode #1 is working beautifully.</p><p>And onto my questions...<br />What&#039;s the purpose of the RepeaterWirelessNetwork?<br />Is it simply to illustrate that you can have a separate wireless network on the secondary/client router?<br />Does the client router still act as a repeater (for MainWirelessNetwork) in the sense that wireless devices get handed-off to the router that has the strongest signal?</p><p>Again, my main goal has been achieved, but it&#039;d be nice if I could make sure that the secondary/client router is being used when devices are connected to MainWirelessNetwork and the secondary/client router has a stronger signal than the main router.</p>									</div>

					<p>Just a question here, I got this working on my tp-link mr-tl3040 but it seems that if the primary WiFi network is out of range the repeated network didn&#039;t get broadcasted.

					<p>Hi,<br />Thanks for your article it helped many of us to configure a repeater. <br />I am using Mode - 1&nbsp; to communicate between 2 routers (DIR505). Both running on openwrt BB and repeater has relayd. Only difference i have in my configuration is that firewall is ON where wwan is masquerading all the traffic.</p><p>This is because i am running coovachilli hotspot on my main router and this is where the problem is. Coova needs mac id of connecting device to differentiate between devices. Because traffic is nat&#039;ed at repeater, coova chilli running at main router treats all traffic from same station and perform it&#039;s login process only for the first device. Device 2nd onwards will not be treated as a separate device causing me issues.</p><p>Now my question is - Considering i can not shutdown firewall (i tried and repeater wwan stops sending traffic to main router) is there any way i can have my repeaters traffic non-nat&#039;ed? Main router should see all devices separately.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have an TP-LINK 3220 v2.1 router and flashed&nbsp; OpenWrt Barrier Breaker 14.07 / LuCI Trunk (0.12+svn-r10530) to it. The openwrt is up and running and I can access the router via the built in Luci. I followed the second part of your guide and the tp-link 3220 router is connected to the main router(Cisco EPC3925) via wifi, but I don&#039;t have internet connection when I connect to the openwrt&#039;s wifi. The connection is etablished to the openwrt wifi but no internet access <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>If I ssh into the openwrt router and ping google.com i get responses (ping is 42ms) but if i run ping it from a client connected to the openwrts wifi the ping is timeouted.</p><p>This is how the luci wifi page looks like:</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://imagizer.imageshack.us/a/img913/5448/2RTDIa.jpg" alt="PunBB bbcode test" /></span></p><p>And these are my config files:<br />wireless:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-device &#039;radio0&#039;

					<p>The main cisco routers ip is: 192.168.0.1<br />and the openwrt ip is: 192.168.19.1<br />I&#039;m don&#039;t know much about networking but I think these are different subnets.

The openwrt router can reach the internet( ping and tracert from the router is working fine) but a client connected to it&#039;s wifi are not able to ping google.com</p><p>edit: I only disabled the Firewall to eliminate a possible problem, I will turn it back as soon as the problem solved.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fhegedus</strong> on 31 Jan 2015, 22:19)</p>
