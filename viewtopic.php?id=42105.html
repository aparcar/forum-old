					<p>No, warranty is void most of the time.<br />First do the 30-30-30 reset<br />after that power cycle it ( yes again ) and as soon as the &quot;sys&quot; led is flashing press and hold the qss button ( on front of your router ).

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I need your help. I can&#039;t acess the webgui but I managed to access via telnet but it still keeps blinking the sys led after qss is pressed and when i tried the opkg command it said:</p><p>Collected errors:<br /> * opkg_conf_load: Could not create lock file /var/lock/opkg.lock: No such file<br />or directory</p><p>What do I do now?<br />What is the 30-30-30 reset?<br />My pc here has only one ethernet plug. :s</p><p>Thank you very much.

					<p>No problem, I will try to explain as clear as possible.</p><p>what you also need to do form the telnet before you start the entire procedure is: mtd -r erase rootfs_data ( this will clean up the old messy configuration ( all the data will be erased on your openwrt device!!!! )</p><p>30-30-30 reset is the following<br />1: ensure the router has power<br />2: press the reset button and hold it for 30 seconds<br />3: remove the power but KEEP the reset button pressed for another 30 seconds<br />4: after 30 seconds plug the power back in and still press the reset button for another 30 seconds<br />5: release the reset button ( finally haha ) and unplug and replug the power cord.</p><br /><br /><p>if you already have the telnet connectivity, set a pwd on it.<br />Ssh will be enabled automatically<br />no use putty ( small tiny program ) and go with ssh to it.<br />Try again with opkg update </p><p>Now the most important step for you, I think, some versions have no opkg but they have ipkg ( it isn&#039;t a type it is an i instead of an o ).</p><p>Try the above and please inform me if you need assistance or if it worked for you so other people can also provide from this topic.</p><p>PS: your username will ALWAYS be root for SSH once a password is set and your password will be the one you set with passwd</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dre2007</strong> on 7 Feb 2013, 09:33)</p>

					<p>I am sorry but your last comment is barely readable.<br />I think you meant that you did the 30-30-30 reset and after that, you clicked the qss without any result?<br />What you should do:<br />plug a cable in your network port and set your ip address to static on 192.168.1.2 with a subnet of 255.255.255.0<br />After that, go to you cmd prompt and type: ping 192.168.1.1 -t<br />Then boot up the device and watch if you receive a echo reply.</p><p>If that didn&#039;t work:<br />Do the same as I described above but as soon as the sys led is going to flash, you press the qss button.<br />Once again look at your cmd prompt and check if you get an echo reply.</p><p>Come back with the results please.</p>									</div>
