					<p>Hi,</p><p>be warned: i&#039;m pretty new to openwrt, so this might be just an stupid config error :-)</p><p>I just installed a new Archer C7 Wifi-Router (192.168.1.xxx Subnet; openwrt 15.05; configured via web interface) which is connected to our house-network (192.168.2.xxx) which connects me to to the internet. Unfortunatly I&#039;ve no administrative access on the house network. </p><p>When setting up the new router to the best of my knowledge (meaning: I didn&#039;t change much, besides passwords and some basic settings) i&#039;ve run into a strange problem. All devices that are connected via cable recieve an IP-Adresse in my private subnet (192.168.1.xxx), but my smartphone and tablet, which connect wireless, recieve an address from the house-network (192.168.2.xxx). How can this happen? And what can I do to ensure that all the wireless clients recieve there IP from my router and not from the house-network?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>the house-network is only wired - i&#039;m definitly connected to the C7-Wireless (already gave it a new SSID, so it is no longer named &quot;Openwrt&quot;). But for some reason the adress assigning seems to be done by the house-networks for my wireless devices. Is it possible that OpenWRT forwards the DHCP-Requests?</p>									</div>

It does what it says on the tin: It bridges network interfaces. Which is something you most definitely don&#039;t want between WAN and LAN.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 2 Jan 2016, 18:09)</p>

					<p>Hey there.</p><p>Metai, could you elaborate why exactly briging was the issue here?</p><p>To me, briding shouldn&#039;t do any harm. Except of some, maybe, some overhead that provides no real benefit, which could be consiered an error itself. But that&#039;s not a technica issue but morely a &quot;not by the book&quot; thing.</p><p>And here&#039;s why:<br />The &quot;lan&quot; interface used ifname eth1, the &quot;wan&quot; interface used ifname eth0. They di used different hardware interface.<br />So setting both, lan and wan to &quot;bridge&quot; separately should *not* create one bridge spanning over both but create two different bridges covering a single individual interface each.</p><p>I&#039;m really looking forward to getting some enlightment. Especially because dropping the bridge statement on wan obviously did the trick.</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>									</div>
