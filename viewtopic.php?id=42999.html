					<p>Hello. I want to send data to my router, that didn&#039;t have public IP but connect to the Internet. His connection to Internet will vary depending on it&#039;s location. Yes his location will change very often. <br />DynDns not suitable.<br />I know that I must build the tunnel with autossh, coz my router will connect to different Access point and I must always have access to it(to my router). How I can do that?<br />P.S. Sorry for my bad english <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Somehow, one end of the &quot;tunnel&quot; will need to communicate its IP address to the other. Generally, you will need the router to report its current IP address to a server that it can identify by a fixed IP address, or through DNS. The other option is if the &quot;far end&quot; of the tunnel is at a known address, then&nbsp; you can watch the tunnel and if it goes down, reconnect from the router.</p><p>DynDNS is one way to do that. Having the router &quot;phone home&quot; to a server at a known or DNS address is another. For example, I have one router I maintain running a cron job that HTTP GETs a URL on a server that I control and I can get its IP address from the request (either from the logs, or from a script on the server at the target URL).</p><p>If <em>both </em>ends of the tunnel can change IP addresses, you could also hope that they never change at the same time and write some kind of fancy script that knows the last IP address of the far end and connects to that any time the near end changes IP addresses. This isn&#039;t an easy thing to make reliable.</p><p>IPv6 might be helpful, but there are a lot of dependencies to get right, as well as needing an ISP or IPv4&lt;-&gt;IPv6 gateway that support it in a reasonable way.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jeffster</strong> on 19 Mar 2013, 22:35)</p>
