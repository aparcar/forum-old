					<p>Hello,<br />today i tried installing open wrt on my router, after i had some trouble with the wifi on stock firmware. (TP-Link TL-WR1043ND v1)<br /> Flashing went fine and i tried starting installing the gui. Since i live in a dormitory i had to change my router ip to 172.16.1.1, so i tried editing the the ip via vi /etc/config/network. It was my first time using vi so failed at it and ended up changing it to 12.18.1.1. From this point on i could never connect to the router again, i always get the error: &quot;connection timed out&quot;, so i startet thinking &quot;reset it and give it an other go&quot;. So i changed my PC ip to 192.186.1.2, put my ethernet cable in slot 1 of the router, unpluged the router and put it back in and pressed the qss button, when the sys light starts blinking, now it is blinking faster, but i still get the error &quot;connection timed out&quot;.<br />Thank you for your help and have a nice day</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hurdlitschka</strong> on 27 Jan 2017, 00:53)</p>
