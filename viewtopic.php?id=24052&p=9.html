					<p>Hi everyone. </p><p>I recently updated my router to RC5. Everything worked fine so I wanted to set up USB slot, which after some struggling, I successfully did. Even NTFS writing and automount is working great! There&#039;s only one thing that, at the end, almost made me to break everything.</p><p>When I tried to copy file (500MB) over ethernet from NAS to USB on router, I got max 1.7MB/s!!! SCP got 1.2MB/s, SMB and FTP got 1.5-1.7MB/s. I tried at least 4 different flash drives (computer speed was 20MB/s on average). And network (WIFI!) transfer from NAS to my computer was ~5MB/s. Copying file from NAS to router /tmp/ gets around 3.5MB/s..</p><p>where&#039;s the catch then? i expected at least 10MB/s to be honest. Is the hardware that doesnt allow faster speed no matter USB slot is standard 2.0?</p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>@jcmalloy, thanks for all the effort, have installed 28139 and it is lots better than any previous release on WL stabiltu, although speed not great. Have now had Asterisk running stable for 1 week, using nprobe to do NetFlow exports to NMS.</p><p>the big hole in this setup is the Asterisk Management GUI, which is not yet available as a package for Asterisk 1.8.8.4-1. from what I can figure out it is available but somebody must just compile it.</p><p>Considering you have the development environment setup and working smoothly, any chance on taking the Asterisk GUI on as a project? I am happy to act as beta tester and provide feedback.Maybe have a look on the Asterisk threads for some discussions with Zandbelt, the maintainer.</p>									</div>
