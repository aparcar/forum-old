					<p>Hi!</p><p>I need to provide Free Wifi in public transport buses, but we need to use a captive portal (users should introduce their mail and accept terms and conditions)<br />We were thinking about using wifidog or coovachilli.</p><p>Do you know about a 3G/4G router openwrt capable? any recommendation?<br />I&#039;d like to have a router where I just need to introduce the sim and make the proper configs, also having a backup battery would be a huge plus.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have been looking for one of these for a while (with battery).&nbsp; I am not aware of any product that has a battery, can hold an internal SIM card, and run OpenWrt .&nbsp; The closest thing is the Hame19, also sold as an Aukey.&nbsp; Some others have been hacking at it, though I do not believe it has any official software.&nbsp; Unfortunately it&#039;s on 4mb of flash makes it challenging space wise in the CC world.&nbsp; </p><p>GLI is working on one, but I would not expect it in the near term.&nbsp; You can find it here. <a href="http://www.gl-inet.com/product/mifi-engineering-board/">http://www.gl-inet.com/product/mifi-engineering-board/</a> You also need a 3g or 4g board and a battery, but it will run from 5V pretty easy.&nbsp; There is no case for it.&nbsp; You would need to inquire about the exact support it has today.</p><p>More info here: <a href="http://www.gl-inet.com/m9331-mifi/">http://www.gl-inet.com/m9331-mifi/</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>RangerZ</strong> on 14 Jan 2016, 01:38)</p>

					<p>I think the battery is the deal breaker here, but what about devices capable of hold internally the sim?<br />I also need to do something similar to this <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2012/03/13/148506762/turning-homeless-men-into-wifi-hotspots-at-sxsw-ignites-debate">http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/ … tes-debate</a>&nbsp; (but hiring people with backpacks instead of homeless) I was able to do a prototype using a tplink router (running openwrt) and attaching a sla battery, but i want something more, let&#039;s say, proffesional. (having the wires coming from the battery and a usb cable from the router to a 4G Wireless looks improvised)</p>									</div>

					<p>@anarchy99 Can you please explain why one would need this module?</p><p>It looks like this device is a newer version of the TL-MR13U and there is this thread, which is vague, about both. <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=44755&amp;p=4">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 55&amp;p=4</a> Looks like there is a version of OpenWrt for the 13.&nbsp; Not clear if it will run on the other version, or what the specs are.&nbsp; I am guessing it&#039;s the SIM.&nbsp; Also from 2013.</p><p>Neither are on <a href="https://wikidevi.com">https://wikidevi.com</a><br />TL-MR13U <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/hwdata/tp-link/tp-link_tl-mr13u_10">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/hwdata/tp- … l-mr13u_10</a><br /><a href="http://www.tp-link.com.cn/product_306.html">http://www.tp-link.com.cn/product_306.html</a><br /><a href="http://www.tp-link.com.cn/product_326.html">http://www.tp-link.com.cn/product_326.html</a> Only claims to support 3G<br />and related<br /><a href="http://www.tp-link.com.cn/product_303.html">http://www.tp-link.com.cn/product_303.html</a><br /><a href="http://www.tp-link.com.cn/product_353.html">http://www.tp-link.com.cn/product_353.html</a></p><p>I think there are some devices out there that carry a battery and sim, but have no Ethernet port, and I consider this an issue under openWrt as there are known issues with changing stations and getting locked out on the LAN.&nbsp; I do not know what they are.</p>									</div>

					<p>there was no opensource driver for 3G modem, unless they released it in the meantime. so you have to add some driver for it to function. </p><p>not sure but i think it has same chipset as mr13u, and more flash/ram.</p>									</div>
