					<p>Hi, I&#039;ve wr841n as a wds client to my AP wr1043nd, both running BB rc3. AP is configured by option htmode HT40- and the client is configured by option htmode HT20.</p><p>I&#039;d like to use 20MHz on the client because it is distant from AP and the interference causes speeds and stability lower on 40MHz than it would be on 20MHz. I can confirm this when I switch AP to HT20. But when I&#039;m in the same room, I&#039;d like to benefit from HT40, so I don&#039;t want force AP to HT20, because I&#039;m on 120mbit line and it is only achieveable on 40Mhz.</p><p>How can I tell client to use HT20? Client somehow ignores the option <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> Could this be a bug?</p>									</div>
