					<p>First, I&#039;d like to thank the openwrt developers for a great package. Second, I&#039;ve built a couple of packages for myself as I&#039;m setting up my router - specifically - the ISC DHCP server (and relay and client) and the Posadis DNS server (almost all the features of bind but appears to be smaller and easier to work with). I don&#039;t know if anyone is interested in these packages (they&#039;re each about 1 MB), but I&#039;d be willing to distribute them if anyone wants them. Are there any guidelines on package format/init file creation?<br />Thanks,<br />David</p>									</div>
