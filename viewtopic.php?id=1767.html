					<p>if you are using a default install, you&#039;re going to have a hard time connecting things to tts0 becasue thats what the kernel uses to spit out messages to all the time, as well as give you a serial console. you have to disable serial console in the menuconfig of the buildroot. if you dont know what that means, get the experiements source code (buildroot), go into its&#039;s dir, and type &#039;make menuconfig&#039; without the &#039;s. SOmewhere in there is an option for using a serial console, and probably &#039;output kernel messages to serial port (or serial console)&#039; etc. disable those, and rebuild the kernel. then you should be able to use tts0</p>									</div>

					<p>I have the experimental build and I have looked for those options in &quot;make menuconfig&quot;.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I can&#039;t find the options or they don&#039;t exist.&nbsp; I was thinking along the same lines that tts/0 is already used.&nbsp; Now its to find out how to disable it.</p>									</div>

					<p>I found linux.config in openwrt/package/linux.&nbsp; I removed &quot;console=ttyS0,115200&quot; from the CONFIG_CMDLINE variable and I also commented out &quot;CONFIG_SERIAL_CONSOLE=y&quot;.&nbsp; I recompiled&nbsp; openwrt and it asked me if I wanted the serial console option and I specified no. After flashing the router and logging in to it, the console variable wasn&#039;t present in dmsg confirming that the changes where made.&nbsp; However, I still can&#039;t use /dev/tts/0.&nbsp; If I connect the router to a PC using a NULL cable, the PC can see the characters typed in microcom (on the router) but the router doesn&#039;t see the characters from the PC.&nbsp; Again on port /dev/tts/1 everything is fine and characters can be seen both ways.&nbsp; Any ideas why port /dev/tts/0 is behaving like this?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello ,<br />to use /dev/tts/0 you must tell the kernel not to open a console at this device and you must have installed the setserial<br />package .<br />Then login in your wrt -box and go to /etc<br />edit the file named inittab with vi , the interesting line in this file should look like this:<br />tts/0::askfirst:/bin/ash --login</p><p>you have to change this line ( comment it out ) , after your change ist should look like this :<br />#tts/0::askfirst:/bin/ash --login</p><p>save the changed inittab </p><p>reboot your wrt <br />Well now you have disabled the console on /dev/tts/0 and you can use this device for other things <br />And be sure that you have installed the setserial package <br />There MUST be a startscript /etc/init/d/S15serial <br />in the file you should find this :<br />#!/bin/sh<br />/usr/sbin/setserial /dev/tts/1 irq 3</p><p>This is very important , normally after boot the device /dev/tts/0 have the IRQ 0 <br />if you have the setserial -package installed , the above script was aumatically installed and set the IRQ for <br />/dev/tts/0 to IRQ 3</p><p>Its not complicated to use&nbsp; this device you must only comment out 1 line as described above in the inittab -file&nbsp; and you must have installed the setserial package <br />And ... YES YOU HAVE NO SERIAL CONSOLE AFTER THIS MODIFICATION ...<br />This is , that only 1 process can use /dev/tts/0 .<br />AND AGAIN YES , YOU CAN SEE THE BOOT -MESSAGES DURING THE BOOT at 115200 baud ,8N1 .</p><p>This works for me here at a WRT54GS wit the lastest Experimental Version .</p>									</div>
