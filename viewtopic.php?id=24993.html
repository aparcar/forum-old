					<p>OK, I have my WNDR3700 up and running OpenWrt, Backfire (10.03).</p><p>Blundering about the OpenWrt web site and forums is like drinking from a firehose, and I&#039;m missing most of the water - and I&#039;m not a networking newbie! OpenWRT, and Linux (iptables seems important here), yes.</p><p>I see <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/netgear/wndr3700">http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/netgear/wndr3700</a> - which took a fair bit of time to wrap my head around (to distinguish between building and just downloading.)</p><p>I also see the WNDR3700 exploration thread, <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=22311">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=22311</a>, which is very nice, albeit it also suffers from the same firehose problem.</p><p>Since I went to that thread like a moth to a flame, perhaps starting this thread, &#039;Netgear WNDR3700 - OpenWRT New User(s)&#039; will be similarly useful.</p><p>I downloaded <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-wndr3700-jffs2-factory.img">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … actory.img</a> and flashed from the stock Netgear web page on the router, successfully. My heart only almost stopped - there&#039;s a fair bit of fear for the new OpenWRT user, just due to the mere foreignness of the environment compared to most retail interfaces. But all was just fine. Note to new readers - luci, an openwrt web interface, comes with the openwrt firmware, and includes a backup / restore facility. [Wanted to verify that was present before proceeding, to be comfortable.] You don&#039;t have to drink all the water in one gulp - you can use the web interface to get you going, and the command line interface when you get that far.</p><p>I then downloaded <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-wndr3700-jffs2-sysupgrade.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … pgrade.bin</a>, to update to current levels. Note for readers - jffs2 is desireable as it lets files be written in place. Luci has a firmware update page that&#039;s easy to find.</p><p>Note: If you go to luci before telneting, the root password will be blank. If you set the password in Luci, telnet will be disabled (as explained in the wiki) - but ssh will work.</p><p>I&#039;ve now blundered all about the luci interface, most makes intuitive sense (the parts that don&#039;t I&#039;ll get to another time). I have a lan, could have a wan if I wanted (another time), it&#039;s acting as a switch behind my isp gateway, and accesses, and is accessible by, the (home) network.</p><p>Thank you OpenWRT and all who participate here.</p><br /><p>First problem: No wi-fi.</p><p>/etc/config/wireless has 0 length. (Of course, the interface isn&#039;t listed in luci, either.)</p><p>To the community: What should be in here? [I&#039;m assuming it (wi-fi) doesn&#039;t come populated, or populate itself?]</p><p>I see references in the wiki and the exploration thread to country codes, which I can deal with, and various sample wireless files - what should be in this file / what do I start with, and where do I go to read more on the contents of this file? [e.g. Can&#039;t change only certain lines, that don&#039;t exist, in a 0 length file.]</p>									</div>

					<p>First you need to install packages such as kmod-ath9k and wpad-mini and reboot.<br />Then, you can run &quot;wifi detect &gt; /etc/config/wireless&quot;.<br />You will now have a working wireless config file, which will be easy to modify to your needs.<br />Please note however that the 5 GHz radio won&#039;t work with the current official build.<br />jffs2 might let you have files written in place, squashfs saves a lot of space so that you can install more packages.</p>									</div>

					<p>@zorxd - Thank you!</p><p>Your note let me zero in on the specific area(s), within the references mentioned in the post starting this thread.</p><br /><p>The 5GHz not working turns out to be OK. My new Asus eee 1201n turns out to not have 5GHz on it&#039;s 802.11n - I was most disappointed to find that out upon receipt. I expected all 802.11n to be 5GHz (even kept my cordless phones at 2.4GHz in anticipation of not conflicting with 802.11n) - sadly, I have thus found that 802.11n is not 5GHz only. &amp;^$%^%&amp;^%. So, cordless phones just now got replaced to DECT, also as a result of this laptop purchase. &lt;sigh&gt; And, of course, being the purpose of this thread, the Netgear WNDR3700 has also been purchased, for the laptop. For the moment, this router will merely be a 802.11n wi-fi access point within my home - the extra 4-port GB switch helps too. Sadly, it&#039;s stock firmware will only set the time via the WAN link (and will not bridge LAN/WAN) - I HATE reading logs across multiple devices with different time stamps. So here I am on the OpenWRT forums! (This router was purchased with an eye towards OpenWRT anyways, I just didn&#039;t expect to be doing it this soon.)</p><p>By the time I get to needing 5GHz 802.11n, I suspect OpenWRT will be ready for me!</p><br /><p>Thank you for the note on jffs2 vs. squashfs. I suspect I&#039;ll be OK for a good while - over time, as I explore and become familiar with OpenWRT, when memory becomes an issue, I expect I&#039;ll be able to reflash to squashfs, restore my configuration via luci, and get on with my day. I just noticed the FAQ link at the top of each forum page, and the note on squashfs vs. jffs2 within it was most helpful and enlightening - to date the difference I had detected was this ability to write in place, which seemed advantageous. The FAQ answer documents that I needn&#039;t have worried. Thus far in my blundering about openwrt.org I have yet to come across a discussion upon the differences and dis/advantages of each. Do you have a good link towards such? And / or a link discussing such a jffs2 backup to squashfs restore process?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One of the daunting things about OpenWRT, as hinted at in the post that starts this thread, is that most &#039;retail&#039; routers have a configuration backup and restore facility - consisting of a single file. Which doesn&#039;t appear to be the case with OpenWRT. Thus, for the moment, the reference to a web / luci based backup / restore facility. In time, since I&#039;m a command-line guy, I&#039;ll get there, but since I&#039;m not there yet it is / was important to establish a backup / restore process - for when I inevitably do something deeply stupid.</p><br /><p>It seems a little strange to download the ar71xx firmware, and then have to load the kmod-ath9k package, etc.</p><p>Poking about the reference docs (msg #1), is #100 (in <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=22311)">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=22311)</a>, #177, and others - searching on mod-ath9k ... </p><p>Also poking about the reference docs, when looking for the complete answer to &#039;install packages such as&quot; in msg #2 above, I see package references to swconfig, ntpclient, crda (debugging only, I&#039;ll pass for the moment), kmod-leds-&lt;various&gt;, wpa-supplicant-mini (I ssume taken care of with wpad-mini), luci-admin-core, luci-theme-openwrt, kmod-mac80211 (brought in by mod-ath9k), and kmod-cfg80211 (brought in by kmod-mac80211). I see in luci that swconfig is already installed, as is kmod-leds-gpio, luci-admin-core and luci-theme-openwrt. Also, obviously, by now, so is luci.</p><p>ntpclient is not installed - but I note that (luci) system / system has time servers defined. The time is correct, so I&#039;ll leave it be and move on for the moment.</p><p>Are the kmod-leds-&lt;various&gt; packages mutually exclusive? I&#039;ll eventually be doing usb, should I add kmod-leds-wndr3700-usb when I get that far?</p><br /><p>So, summarizing this &#039;add wi-fi&#039; step, having ssh&#039;ed in:</p><p># opkg update<br />Downloading <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03/ar71xx/packages/Packages.gz">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … ackages.gz</a>.<br />Inflating <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03/ar71xx/packages/Packages.gz">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … ackages.gz</a>.<br />Updated list of available packages in /var/opkg-lists/packages.</p><p># opkg install mod-ath9k wpad-mini<br />Installing wpad-mini (20100309-1) to root...<br />Downloading <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03/ar71xx/packages/wpad-mini_20100309-1_ar71xx.ipk">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … ar71xx.ipk</a>.<br />Installing crda (1.1.0-2) to root...<br />Downloading <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03/ar71xx/packages/crda_1.1.0-2_ar71xx.ipk">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … ar71xx.ipk</a>.<br />Installing kmod-mac80211 (2.6.32.10+2010-03-24-5) to root...<br />Downloading <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03/ar71xx/packages/kmod-mac80211_2.6.32.10+2010-03-24-ar71xx.ipk">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … ar71xx.ipk</a>.<br />Installing kmod-crypto-core (2.6.32.10-1) to root...<br />Downloading <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03/ar71xx/packages/kmod-crypto-core_2.6.32.10-1_ar71xx.ipk">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … ar71xx.ipk</a>.<br />Installing kmod-crypto-arc4 (2.6.32.10-1) to root...<br />Downloading <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03/ar71xx/packages/kmod-crypto-arc4_2.6.32.10-1_ar71xx.ipk">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … ar71xx.ipk</a>.<br />Installing kmod-crypto-aes (2.6.32.10-1) to root...<br />Downloading <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03/ar71xx/packages/kmod-crypto-aes_2.6.32.10-1_ar71xx.ipk">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … ar71xx.ipk</a>.<br />Installing kmod-cfg80211 (2.6.32.10+2010-03-24-5) to root...<br />Downloading <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03/ar71xx/packages/kmod-cfg80211_2.6.32.10+2010-03-24-5_ar71xx.ipk">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … ar71xx.ipk</a>.<br />Installing wireless-tools (29-4) to root...<br />Downloading <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03/ar71xx/packages/wireless-tools_29-4_ar71xx.ipk">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … ar71xx.ipk</a>.<br />Installing iw (0.9.19-1) to root...<br />Downloading <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03/ar71xx/packages/iw_0.9.19-1_ar71xx.ipk">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … ar71xx.ipk</a>.<br />Configuring iw.<br />Configuring kmod-crypto-core.<br />Configuring kmod-crypto-arc4.<br />Configuring kmod-crypto-aes.<br />Configuring wireless-tools.<br />Configuring kmod-cfg80211.<br />Configuring kmod-mac80211.<br />Configuring crda.<br />Configuring wpad-mini.<br />Collected errors:<br /> * opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package mod-ath9k.</p><p># opkg install kmod-ath9k&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;----- fixing the stupid typo ...<br />Installing kmod-ath9k (2.6.32.10+2010-03-24-5) to root...<br />Downloading <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03/ar71xx/packages/kmod-ath9k_2.6.32.10+2010-03-24-5_ar71xx.ipk">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … ar71xx.ipk</a>.<br />Installing kmod-ath (2.6.32.10+2010-03-24-5) to root...<br />Downloading <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03/ar71xx/packages/kmod-ath_2.6.32.10+2010-03-24-5_ar71xx.ipk">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … ar71xx.ipk</a>.<br />Configuring kmod-ath.<br />Configuring kmod-ath9k.</p><p># exit (I&#039;ll let Luci do a graceful restart.)</p><p>Luci: System / Reboot / Perform reboot</p><p>And lo, and behold, Luci: Network / Wifi, shows two radios!

Correction, not working for me completely. I suspect it is connecting, but my Win 7 laptop isn&#039;t entirely happy - probably for lack of a network setting or gateway or something. I expect this will prove to be a user or config file issue, not an openwrt / package issue - so thank you very much zorxd. Certainly my SSID pops up in the network list, and disappears when I tick off &#039;Hide ESSID&#039;. So I doubt this is a hardware or openwrt / package problem.</p><p>I do notice that I have to keep &#039;route add default gw 1.2.3.4&#039;, so I have an adapter configuration issue here. (Confusion / conflict between wan/lan settings.) And, since the switch is on my local lan, and it&#039;s handing out local lan addresses on radio0 (passing dhcp through, as it&#039;s turned off in openwrt), I have a confused network. Hopefully I&#039;ll sort out the adapter settings issue, and get lan/wlan bridged - but tomorrow.</p><br /><p>To summarize the questions posed above:<br />- is there a link regarding the pros/cons dis/advantages of jffs2 vs squashfs?<br />- is there a link discussing a jffs2 backup to squashfs restore process?<br />- the time is correct. Is it appropriate to install rtpclient?<br />- are the kmod-leds-&lt;various&gt; packages mutually exclusive? kmod-leds-wndr3700-usb and kmod-ledgs-gpio will coexist?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bs27975</strong> on 29 May 2010, 07:36)</p>

I noticed successful password-less ssh&#039;ing right after I created my windows userid in /etc/passwd, so I assumed that was what did it. Now, with either userid, it goes right in. Can&#039;t make it ask for a password even. In any case, any thought that dropbear wouldn&#039;t do both simultaneously, has been proven wrong.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bs27975</strong> on 30 May 2010, 12:19)</p>

					<p>Yes you got it, this is because some other routers have a different switch. Some platforms don&#039;t even use swconfig command I think.</p>									</div>

					<p>Seems to me I&#039;ve seen references to the SSIDs on both radio0 (2.4GHz) and radio1 (5GHz) being the same. It also seems to me that this 802.11n &#039;thing&#039; permits both channel bonding and radio frequency bonding, i.e. both radios, and multiple channels per radio, &#039;bonding&#039; together to make a faster whole. Am I absorbing this &#039;stuff&#039; correctly? e.g. Currently the SSIDs are different, &#039;mywifi-2&#039; and &#039;mywifi-5&#039;. Should they both just be &#039;mywifi&#039;?</p><p>Thanks for any clarity. Or web link references.</p>									</div>

					<p>Oh my,</p><p>Don&#039;t tell me the WNDR3700 is going to die on the vine too. I installed the first few precompile firmwares and they work pretty well. Now it looks like this device&#039;s support is going to be obscure and risky for some time into the future. Isn&#039;t this pretty much the only dual-radio gigabit router out there? For me that makes it the best available device. But after I bricked my WRT600n I don&#039;t want to have to deal with skeevy image files.</p>									</div>
