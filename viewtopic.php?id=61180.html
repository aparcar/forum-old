					<p>Hi, I have a interesting problem I am unable to figure out the solution to. I have a Linksys WRT1900AC (ver1 variant) that was running the stock 1.1.10.167514 version of the Linksys firmware when I flashed it to Chaos Calmer 15.05-rc3 (openwrt-15.05-rc3-mvebu-armada-xp-linksys-mamba-squashfs-factory). Everything is working OK on the OpenWRT firmware, however I wanted to try and revert back to the stock Linksys firmware (FW_WRT1900AC_1.1.10.167514_prod).</p><p>The issue I am running into is the ethernet ports once flashed back to the stock firmware no longer work. Wiifi (the ONLY way I can re-access the portal and WAN work, but even with a machine&#039;s IP statically assigned a IP 192.168.1.101,255.255.255.0,192.168.1 it will show me physical connection, but nothing beyond that. The only solution I have is to revert back to OpenWRT and everything works again..</p><p>I attempted to search for this problem, but I didn&#039;t find any reports of this before. Any advise?</p>									</div>
