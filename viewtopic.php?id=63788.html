					<p>Need help!<br />I am trying to configure openwrt so that the radio interfaces in the same box can talk to each other. I am trying to measure the latency when transferring data from one radio to another. The box isnt connected to the internet. <br />I configured one as AP and the other as client. Both of them have static IP addresses. And tried to connect the client to the AP (through the LUCI interface) and it doesnt work.</p><p>Are there any restrictions on having both AP and client in the same box? Any suggestions on how to get this to work?</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>									</div>

					<p>Do you have two wireless cards, or are you doing this on one wireless card?</p><p>You can set up an AP and an STA on the same wireless card, however (at least for the mac80211 driver) the AP will not become active until the STA has connected.&nbsp; This might be your problem if you are doing this on one wireless card.</p><p>If you have the AP and STA on different wireless cards, I haven&#039;t tried this before (cool idea though), but it ought to work as you are expecting it to..... an actual hardware over-the-air loopback path.</p>									</div>
