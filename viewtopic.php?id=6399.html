					<p>My system is configured to use dnsmasq to provide local network name resolution; the OpenWRT router is pointed at it too, but DNSmasq comes up too late in the boot process for NTP client. This change just checks that both a default route is available and the name is resolvable, and keeps sleeping until that is the case. </p><p>I suppose it might want minor alteration to check for IP returns from the nvram to short circuit the test.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

Everyone seems to fling huge sets fo nvram show | sort about to diagnose problems and it&#039;d be handy for comparing configs to see what you have thats not the same <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Just wondering; hope the scripts helpful</p><p>Matt</p>									</div>
