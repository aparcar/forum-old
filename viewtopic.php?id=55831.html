					<p>Dumb question alert!<br />I have two routers at home on different networks. While i can easily put them on the same network and solve my issue i would like to know how to solve it anyways.</p><p>Router 1 ( Openwrt): 192.168.200.1<br />Router 2 (DD-wrt): 192.168.1.1</p><p>Lets say Router 1 is the main router and my internet access router connected to my cable modem.<br />Router 2 is connected to one of the LAN ports of Router 1.</p><p>What would i need to do so that traffic and route between the two routers and the devices on them?<br />Would this be done by adding routes or i would have to venture into Vlans?</p>									</div>

					<p>Configure R2 as a bridge with R1 as a main router, R2 should be with a static IP. That may help.</p>									</div>

					<p>@dan5146<br />Thanks i will try that. However i cant see that working. I could be wrong though.<br />Both routers do have static IPs.</p><p>Another person also mentioned that perhaps i should connect R2&#039;s WAN port to the lan port of R1?</p>									</div>

					<p>ok so i tried something simpler and it works.<br />On my main router i set it up with a netmask of 255.255.0.0 (16) instead of the usual 255.255.255.0 (24)<br />Now both routers can talk to each other.</p>									</div>

					<p>You don&#039;t have two networks after you do that.&nbsp; You now have one big non-standard network.&nbsp; This will not isolate users from each other.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t want to isolate users, do what dan said with everything in 192.168.1.x.</p>									</div>
