					<p>I&#039;ve got the openwrt experimental build running on my wrt54gs v1.1.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tweaked the firewall and QoS settings and it&#039;s now supporting all of my &quot;must have&quot; requirements.&nbsp; Now I&#039;m wondering how to do port triggering.&nbsp; A lot of the home-market routers support this via their web interfaces.&nbsp; Basically, when an application makes an outbound connection using a certain port, that triggers the router to enable an inbound port forward to the internal IP that made the outbound connection.&nbsp; This is useful for online gaming, bittorrent, you name it.&nbsp; Obviously, only 1 internal host can be grabbing the triggered inbound ports at a time.&nbsp; But that&#039;s the nice thing about it, no firewall config is needed when the game is started on a different box the next day.</p><p>Any help is appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have been thinking it&#039;s possible a port knocker may have that function included, but I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; My understanding of port knocking is that it is not the same as port triggering.</p><p>The closest thing I&#039;ve found with &quot;raw&quot; iptables is using the &quot;recent&quot; module to store an IP address and somehow fire a rule.&nbsp; However, I&#039;m not sure that the functionality I want is easily done with straight IP tables rules.&nbsp; Maybe there is a way to have iptables send the outbound &quot;trigger&quot; packet to userspace, and a daemon there inspects it and adds the appropriate rules for the inbound port forward.&nbsp; With enough goofing around I could probably write that code myself.&nbsp; </p><p>I&#039;m just surprised I haven&#039;t found a simple way to do it with iptables, when all the routers do it out of the box.</p>									</div>
