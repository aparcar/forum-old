					<p>Dear zloop,</p><p>sorry but the only recommended version for my router (ASUS WL-500g Premium V1) is Backfire :<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/asus/wl500gp">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/asus/wl500gp</a></p><p>And Aria2 is not available for it :<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/brcm47xx/packages/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … /packages/</a></p><p>Then the answer is : yes I already checked if already exist. And as you can see it is not available to run on Backfire 10.03.1</p><p>This is why I asked if some developer could please create this really interesting package.</p><p>Could you help or see it with the developer team if you are one of them.</p><p>Sincerely thanks and have a nice day,</p><p>Miguipda ;-)</p>									</div>

					<p>Im sorry for the noob question, but is aria2 supported on x86?</p><p>Today I&#039;ve seen that is available in BB &amp; trunk package repository, so tried to install it (i&#039;ve tried to install it both via terminal and including it into a self-build image) but I wasn&#039;t able run it, since it seems that I didn&#039;t get any aria2 script file into /etc/config.</p><p>Initially, when I&#039;ve tried to install it via terminal, I thought that was a problem of missing dependency, so I&#039;ve tried to include it from the buildroot building a new image, (that if I dont mistake, when a package were selected it automatically set the correct dependency, right?), but I haven&#039;t solved the problem. </p><p>Any idea??</p><p>Thanks you very much in advance.</p><p><strong>EDIT: Solved following this guide: <a href="http://eko.one.pl/?p=openwrt-aria2">http://eko.one.pl/?p=openwrt-aria2</a> </strong></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mirko_47</strong> on 10 Feb 2015, 00:01)</p>
