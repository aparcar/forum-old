					<p>Attempting to setup openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr1043nd-v1-squashfs-factory.bin on the stipulated router (WR1043ND)<br />I started right out diddling around since I am never able to really understand the documentation without doing so.</p><p>I managed to get the flash done ok but attempting to setup things so the wr1043nd could be plugged in Wan side to my existing router and fiddled with rather than attempting to make it the gateway router until I understand better what is what.</p><p>Cutting to the chase; I setup a collision instead and could not access the 1043 on any address.&nbsp; I managed to gain access again thru reboot and push a button repeatedly.</p><p>Commenced to screwing things up some more with uci.&nbsp; What I want is the wan to be in 192.168.1.0/24 network and lan to be in 192.168.2.0/24</p><p>The current gateway router is setup to hand out dhcp addresses.&nbsp; I had foolishly set the wan side protocal variable to static and <br />changing it back now to dhcp (the default)<br />But in the meantime I had assigned a static address.</p><p>So anyway again skipping all my foibles the setup currently looks like:</p><p>wan side:<br />root@OpenWrt:~# uci show network.wan</p><p>network.wan=interface<br />network.wan.ifname=eth0.2<br />network.wan.netmask=255.255.255.0<br />network.wan.proto=dhcp<br />========================</p><p>I removed ipaddr with uci set network.wan.ipaddr= thinking it would allow a dhcp address to be taken<br />What should it be set too if anything? Is there anything else missing there?</p><p>==============================</p><p>lan side:root@OpenWrt:~# uci show network.lan</p><p>network.lan=interface<br />network.lan.ifname=eth0.1<br />network.lan.type=bridge<br />network.lan.netmask=255.255.255.0<br />network.lan.ipaddr=192.168.2.1<br />network.lan.proto=static<br />==============================</p><p>lan side appears ok and is actually working since I can connect to it via ssh.</p><p>But again what to do so as to reistablish sensible settings on the wan side?&nbsp; Settings that would allow the current network 192.168.1.0/24 router to pass it a dhcp address?&nbsp; Can it all be done with uci?</p>									</div>
