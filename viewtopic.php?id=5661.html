					<p>Hi,</p><p>For the past couple of days, I&#039;ve been trying to make alsa work fully with a usb audio card on a WGT634U. Since full-duplex didn&#039;t appear to work with OSS emulation (although I&#039;m not sure how to test it correctly, other than try to open /dev/dsp for r/w), and asterisk&#039;s chan_oss seems to only slow down the box, I&#039;ve tried compiling alsa-lib, -utils and esound, using the packages here:</p><p><a href="http://sokrates.mimuw.edu.pl/~sebek/openwrt/">http://sokrates.mimuw.edu.pl/~sebek/openwrt/</a></p><p>They compile fine (tried up to 1.0.11, including alsa-driver), but nothing using libasound seems to work (except esd, which works, but _very_ slowly).</p><p>alsamixer:<br />Crashes when pressing F1-F4, but not F5 (??), otherwise seems fine</p><p>arecord (all formats/options, it seems):<br />Recording WAVE &#039;(null)&#039; : Unsigned 8 bit, Rate 8000 Hz, Mono<br />Floating point exception</p><p>aplay:<br />Playing WAVE &#039;play.wav&#039; : Signed 16 bit Little Endian, Rate 44100 Hz, Stereo<br />aplay: set_params:1005: unable to install sw params:<br />start_mode: EXPLICIT<br />xrun_mode: NONE<br />tstamp_mode: NONE<br />period_step: 1<br />sleep_min: 0<br />avail_min: 0<br />xfer_align: 268443944<br />silence_threshold: 0<br />silence_size: 0<br />boundary: 1073741824</p><p>madplay (compiled with alsa support):<br />MPEG Audio Decoder 0.15.2 (beta) - Copyright (C) 2000-2004 Robert Leslie et al.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Year: 2002<br />Segmentation fault<br />(using oss works fine)</p><p>(the card itself doesn&#039;t seem to be the problem, I&#039;ve been using it for a while even with older 2.6 kernels)</p><p>Any ideas?
