					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m new to OpenWrt and have installed &quot;OpenWrt Kamikaze - With X-Wrt Extensions 7.09&quot; to my Asus WL-500gp. What I found is that my clients cannot resolve DNS-names when I turn of the dhcp-server (via the GUI) on my router although the clients have static IP-addresses. <br />Pinging via IP from the clients and via IP and name from the router works. When I enable the dhcp-service&nbsp; evreything works fine. But why?</p><p>TIA</p><p>sandokan</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sandokan</strong> on 7 Jan 2008, 09:47)</p>

					<p>Compare what the router config is like when you turn on dhcp services verses when the services are off and you will have your answer.</p><p>Try doing a diff of the systems /etc directory.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pshempel</strong> on 7 Jan 2008, 20:11)</p>

					<p>OpenWRT uses a package called dnsmasq to do both dhcp and dns.&nbsp; It can be used for either, or both.&nbsp; There&#039;s a good chance that &quot;disabling dhcp service&quot; shut off dnsmasq entirely.&nbsp; This is probably something to take up with X-WRT as it&#039;s their GUI.</p>									</div>
