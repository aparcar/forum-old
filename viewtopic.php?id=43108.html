					<p>I managed to flash the DLink DSL-504T GenII I wrote about here: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=43036">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=43036</a></p><p>When I rebooted the modem after the flash, the status light gave a rapid heartbeat, which eventually slowed to a more normal (for a router) pace. The light for the LAN port to which I was connected was lit. All looked good. Unfortunately, after the reboot the router did not serve DHCP addresses. Configuring my machine with a static IP on 192.168.1.2 and pinging 192.168.1.1 failed to reach the router as well. </p><p>Why might the heartbeat look good, but no network be available? All ideas are welcome, because I&#039;m out. Thanks guys!</p>									</div>

					<p>Three reflashes later (with various partitioning structures), and I still invariably find myself in the same spot: a healthy heartbeat, but no connectivity. Surely someone has a guess?</p>									</div>

					<p>The default network configuration in the latest builds won&#039;t work on this router. To get it to work, you have to build yourself an image. Change the target/linux/ar7/base-files/etc/config/network file. Change the line:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;eth0 eth1 eth0.1 eth0.2&quot;</p><p>to</p><p>&nbsp; option ifname &quot;eth0&quot;</p>									</div>
