					<p>I&#039;ve compiled with &quot;Target Profile (Broadcom BCM43xx WiFi (wl, proprietary))&quot; and deployed to my WRT300n v1, however I cannot get the wl driver to work. </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/# lsmod | grep wl
wl                   1466816  0 
wl_glue                 2208  1 wl</code></pre></div><p><a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Linksys_WRT300N_v1,_v1.1">Others</a> seem to have this working, and <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/10045">10045</a> indicates that installing the proprietary broadcom driver should work. </p><p>I&#039;ve read through how the ssb and pci drivers initialize, and added some dmesg tracing to try to help. It looks to me like the problem is in linux/drivers/ssb/driver_pcicore.c, at the end of &quot;static int __devinit pcicore_is_in_hostmode(struct ssb_pcicore *pc)&quot; where it calls mips_busprobe32 to test for non-error. It returns 0xfffffff2, but I have no idea what bus exception this actually means.</p><p>From linux/drivers/ssb/driver_pcicore.c:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/* Probe a 32bit value on the bus and catch bus exceptions.
 * Returns nonzero on a bus exception.
 * This is MIPS specific */
#define mips_busprobe32(val, addr)      get_dbe((val), ((u32 *)(addr)))</code></pre></div><p>Can somebody explain to me what get_dbe does (it&#039;d code seems to be written in assembler)? I am not even clear on if the exception is a MIPS thing, SSB thing, or PCI thing! </p><p>Am I way off looking at the PCI stuff? Does the wl_glue module hide the PCI layer, or something like that?</p>									</div>
