					<p>Hi everyone!<br />I have a brand new wr841n and I want to show a splash screen to users on the wifi network. After a lot of reserch I found OpenWRT and NoDogSplash and WifiDog, but I had no luck setting them up.</p><p>First, I tried trunk image. After installing it, I tried to install Luci and NoDogSplash but I had no space left on the device. </p><p>So I kept looking in the forum and I found mani different images, specially one by Borromini. But I have the same issue with all of them. After insalling and having plenty of space to do my stuff, when I try to install NoDogSplash I get an error saying &quot;Cannot satisfy the following dependencies for nodogsplash: * kernel&quot;</p><p>I&#039;m downloading VirtualBox right now so I can try to make my own image (I have no idea how to do it yet). In the meantime, do you have any advice? Is there anything else I can try to do? Do you recommend me any particular image I can test?</p><p>I don&#039;t want to buy a new router, but... should I? In case none of this work, which is the smallest cheapest router I can buy to set up this splash screen?</p><br /><p>Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>
