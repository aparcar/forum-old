					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;m just trying to set up a Fonera 2200 with B.A.T.M.A.N. advanced. Configuring a wireless interface in ad-hoc mode for B.A.T.M.A.N. works just fine, the mesh seems to be running stable with about 10 nodes. But whenever I try to add a second wireless interface that acts as an public access point, configuration fails. /etc/config/wireless looks as follows:</p><p>----------------<br />config wifi-device&nbsp; wifi0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option type&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;atheros<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option channel&nbsp; auto</p><p>config wifi-iface&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;public<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option device&nbsp; &nbsp;wifi0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option network&nbsp; lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option mode&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ap<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ssid&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Public<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option encryption psk<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option key 53cr37</p><p>config wifi-iface&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;mesh<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option device&nbsp; &nbsp;wifi0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option mode&nbsp; &nbsp; adhoc<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ssid&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; batnet<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option encryption none<br />----------------</p><p>Whenever i bring the mesh interface up, the public WLAN (&quot;Public&quot;) stops working and vice versa. I can connect to it for about a second but I always get disconnected soon after. I tried &quot;ahdemo&quot; mode for the mesh device but that didn&#039;t help. Also, doing all steps to manually bring up the two devices had the same result.</p><p>I think this is a pretty common problem but I didn&#039;t find a clear answer in this forum so maybe anyone of you can give me a hint?</p><p>Thanks a lot!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>brainslug</strong> on 14 Jul 2008, 01:02)</p>
