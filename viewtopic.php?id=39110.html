					<p>I dug up an Actiontec GT704 that I wanted to get running on OpenWRT.&nbsp; The wiki lists it as supported since Kamikaze (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/actiontec/gt704wg">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/actiontec/gt704wg</a>), though states the wireless is a WIP.</p><p>I got the Backfire AR7 image flashed and booting, but networking isn&#039;t working.&nbsp; My config is unchanged from the default - eth0 and eth1 are bridged into lan, with dnsmasq providing DHCP to clients.</p><p>When connecting a PC, however, I see that eth1 (I think - currently away from box) is receiving traffic (I assume the DHCP requests), but not responding at all (no bytes transmitted, client never gets an IP address).</p><p>Any ideas where I should start diagnosing and debugging the problem?</p>									</div>

					<p>Bonus points - anyone have an idea what needs to happen still to get wireless to work?&nbsp; I tempted fate by enabling it, and got a lot of error messages spewed out.&nbsp; I&#039;m not afraid to poke at it, but haven&#039;t seen any docs about what needs to be figured out still.</p>									</div>
