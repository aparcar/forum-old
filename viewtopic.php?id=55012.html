					<p>Hi all and happy new year,</p><p>got a bit confused: I just wanted to change my DNS config a bit and was looking for the configured DNS servers. Configuration before was done through Luci.</p><p>Now the reference for the servers is stored in /tmp/resolv.conf.auto not /etc/dnsmasq.conf nor /etc/config/dhcp</p><p>Any specific reason for this? Because I am a bit scared that next reboot DNS information could get lost.</p><p>...Explanations welcme...</p>									</div>
