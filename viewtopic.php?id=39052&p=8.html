					<p>Dear good people who have helped me over the last 2 pages, I&#039;ve finally gotten things working, however... there are a couple of hiccups.</p><p>1. Everything is nominal. I test failover: Assuming I have a tcp connection to an online host via WAN1 already. I now unplug WAN2. tcp connection in WAN1 breaks. I need to reconnect. (In pfssense, this wouldn&#039;t happen). I assume it&#039;s because the mwan3 script restarts itself and drops all connections. I would guess the main code itself must be altered quite a bit to not drop the connections... is it complex work? I&#039;m willing to give it a shot heh.</p><p>2. I&#039;ve had several auto-restarts while testing. Not sure if it&#039;s because i ran 3x tcpdump + iftop and choked something. Or if it&#039;s due to mwan3. I&#039;ve seen this router act funny when there&#039;s load. Care to comment?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>biatche</strong> on 22 Apr 2013, 15:55)</p>

Check the /etc/config/uhttpd file you may be able to specify other pages you can make. You can also call uhttpd by itself from another script and have it serve a different page. There&#039;s even tools to create pages using shell script which are pretty handy. You may wish to make another post about this as I&#039;m a little too lazy to figure this out at the moment and will be spending my time getting the device name information working over the next few days.</p>									</div>
