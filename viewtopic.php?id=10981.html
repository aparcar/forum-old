					<p>You just figured out that Kamikaze does not use nvram, therefore it does not need to set any defaults. Going back to WR would reproduce your past experiences. But...Why would you want to go back to WR?</p>									</div>

					<p>My entire perspective has changed.&nbsp; Kamikaze has now jumped the hurdle into a more mainstream release.&nbsp; This raises the bar a little. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>And congrats to the OpwnWrt team for making it happen.</p>									</div>
