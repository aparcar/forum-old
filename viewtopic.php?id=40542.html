					<p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; &nbsp;To start with, I tried commenting out the two calls to usb_control_msg() in the .c file (and replacing them with if(1==1).&nbsp; &nbsp;Those lines looked suspiciously like causes of the __stack_chk_fail error.</p><p>After this, then it nicely informed me that I was missing the libusb0.1.so.4 library.&nbsp; &nbsp;So I followed the instructions here:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=19006">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=19006</a></p><p>I get the following warnings - does this mean that I&#039;m missing a pile of other libraries?</p><p>tmp/.config-package.in:11:warning: &#039;select&#039; used by config symbol &#039;PACKAGE_hub-ctrl&#039; refer to undefined symbol &#039;PACKAGE_libc&#039;<br />tmp/.config-package.in:12:warning: &#039;select&#039; used by config symbol &#039;PACKAGE_hub-ctrl&#039; refer to undefined symbol &#039;PACKAGE_librt&#039;<br />tmp/.config-package.in:13:warning: &#039;select&#039; used by config symbol &#039;PACKAGE_hub-ctrl&#039; refer to undefined symbol &#039;PACKAGE_libpthread&#039;<br />tmp/.config-package.in:26:warning: &#039;select&#039; used by config symbol &#039;PACKAGE_libusb&#039; refer to undefined symbol &#039;PACKAGE_libc&#039;<br />tmp/.config-package.in:27:warning: &#039;select&#039; used by config symbol &#039;PACKAGE_libusb&#039; refer to undefined symbol &#039;PACKAGE_librt&#039;<br />tmp/.config-package.in:28:warning: &#039;select&#039; used by config symbol &#039;PACKAGE_libusb&#039; refer to undefined symbol &#039;PACKAGE_libpthread&#039;<br />tmp/.config-package.in:38:warning: &#039;select&#039; used by config symbol &#039;PACKAGE_libusbpp&#039; refer to undefined symbol &#039;PACKAGE_libc&#039;<br />tmp/.config-package.in:39:warning: &#039;select&#039; used by config symbol &#039;PACKAGE_libusbpp&#039; refer to undefined symbol &#039;PACKAGE_uclibcxx&#039;<br />tmp/.config-package.in:40:warning: &#039;select&#039; used by config symbol &#039;PACKAGE_libusbpp&#039; refer to undefined symbol &#039;PACKAGE_libstdcpp&#039;<br />tmp/.config-package.in:41:warning: &#039;select&#039; used by config symbol &#039;PACKAGE_libusbpp&#039; refer to undefined symbol &#039;PACKAGE_librt&#039;<br />tmp/.config-package.in:43:warning: &#039;select&#039; used by config symbol &#039;PACKAGE_libusbpp&#039; refer to undefined symbol &#039;PACKAGE_libpthread&#039;</p><br /><p>Then I run make and it fails with the following error:</p><p>checking build system type... i686-pc-linux-gnu<br />checking host system type... configure: error: /bin/bash ./config.sub -openwrt-linux failed<br />configure: WARNING: cache variable ac_cv_host contains a newline<br />make[3]: *** [/home/user/openwrt/build_dir/target-_-/libusb-0.1.12/.configured_] Error 1<br />make[3]: Leaving directory `/home/user/openwrt/feeds/packages/libs/libusb&#039;<br />make[2]: *** [package/feeds/packages/libusb/compile] Error 2<br />make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/user/openwrt&#039;<br />make[1]: *** [/home/user/openwrt/staging_dir/target-_-/stamp/.package_compile] Error 2<br />make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/user/openwrt&#039;<br />make: *** [world] Error 2</p><br /><p>I&#039;m really hoping this is something simple - hopefully just me not knowing what I&#039;m doing.</p><p>Would appreciate any assistance.</p>									</div>

					<p>Nah, I narrowed down the lines of code having the issue.&nbsp; &nbsp;As that guy says, the program was compiled with some sort of command line switch &quot;stack protector&quot; feature.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately the OpenWRT compiler doesn&#039;t support that feature - so you&#039;d have to change the code so it didn&#039;t need that switch, but it&#039;s not the hub-ctrl.c file that needs changing, it&#039;s one of the usb libraries that it references.&nbsp; &nbsp;So now you&#039;d have have to go through to code for that usb library and find where it performs unsafe stack calls, and remove them, replace them with something else. </p><p>My school boy c skills just don&#039;t run to that level I&#039;m afraid, but if you do get anywhere with it, I&#039;d love to know. </p><p>I was going to put a relay into the USB power, then use it to turn on and off stuff.&nbsp; &nbsp;In the end, I just bought a Serial relay off ebay and switched the relay though that.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is the one I used if you&#039;re interested: <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/USB-to-TTL-strobe-PL2303-RTS-UART-high-active-RS-232-relay-controller-SPDT-/181214672144?pt=US_Parallel_Serial_PS_2_Cables_Adapters&amp;hash=item2a313c7510">http://www.ebay.com/itm/USB-to-TTL-stro … 2a313c7510</a></p><p>Cheers,<br />Henry</p>									</div>
