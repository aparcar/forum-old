					<p>Hello,<br />I&#039;ve bought myself 2 TP-Link tl-wr1043nd routers and flashed Attitude Adjustment (12.09 final) on it.<br />I want that my incoming internet signal from my modem get directly passed trough to my pfSense router VM (Virtual Machine) on my ESXi server, this VM does all the routing, firewall, NAT, DHCP and DNS jobs.<br />Because my server is on the first floor and I also want LAN access on the main floor in our house, I thought VLANs is a great solution for me, this because I can seperate different networks over network 1 cable (if I understand it correctly <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />).<br />The reason for VLANs is because 2 network cables between the main floor and the second floor is no option here! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />On my pfSense virtual router I also have configured an guest network what I want to broadcast wirelessly on both routers.</p><p>My server has 3 NIC&#039;s, 1 for the WAN connection, 1 for the LAN network and 1 for the guest network.<br />the intention is that these 3 cables are plugged into the TP-Link, and the TP-Link broadcast the Wireless and Guest network over WiFi.<br />From my TP-Link (which is connected to the server), there goes ONE cable to the TP-Link that is in our fuse box, this TP-Link broadcasts the same LAN and guest network as the TP-link connected to the server, also the WAN connection has to go over this SINGLE network connection (WAN is an static IP from my modem that must go directly to the pfSense router VM).</p><p>For clarity I have added a sketch:<br /><a href="http://postimg.org/image/w63gc2wrv/"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://s17.postimg.org/w63gc2wrv/schema.jpg" alt="http://s17.postimg.org/w63gc2wrv/schema.jpg" /></span></a></p><br /><br /><p>My question:<br />How can / should I configure this?<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=43882">I&#039;ve already found an article, but I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s a good example for my</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Chrisiesmit93</strong> on 2 May 2013, 22:57)</p>
