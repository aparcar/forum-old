					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am currently using a HP Microserver as my home server but feel like it is being overkill for what I use it for.<br />I was previously using a Seagate Dockstar that was almost fine but just a bit underpowered.</p><p>This is what I do on my server that is running Debian:<br /></p><ul><li><p>Storage (4TB+2TB for redundancy with rsync)</p></li><li><p>Router (2xGb Eth), Firewall (iptables), DNS cache and DHCP (dnsmasq), Host filtering (Nintendo servers, ads)</p></li><li><p>SSH server (control and remote file access)</p></li><li><p>Samba server (max 2 users concurently)</p></li><li><p>Apache web server &amp; mysql &amp; PHP: ampache, wordpress, piwigo, static pages/objects. HTTPS with Letsencrypt. The web server is very low traffic: max amount of concurrent user must be 3 or 4.</p></li><li><p>Munin</p></li><li><p>Transmission</p></li><li><p>MPD (USB sound card)</p></li><li><p>Dropbox backups</p></li><li><p>Dynamic DNS (inadyn)</p></li><li><p>Beets (Python progam for music management)</p></li><li><p>fail2ban</p></li><li><p>external wifi AP (used to be hostapd with internal PCIe)</p></li></ul><p>I saw that they now have routers with Cortex A9 CPU, USB3 and 256MB RAM so was considering a Netgear R7000 for example.</p><p>Could it replace my server with a USB3 HDD ? I would then resell my microserver and have a lower power, lower noise device with better wifi (currently using a 2.4GHz basic 150Mbps AP).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>snk4ever</strong> on 11 Oct 2016, 15:37)</p>

					<p>No guarantees all goes flawlessly.<br />Someone in parallel topic blamed his 200$ dual core arm router cant output more than 30 mbytes/sec thru samba while PC can do 100 mb/s.<br />You say you have gbit connection. If you really connected to inet with that speed or even 300 mbps then arm can be too slow to handle natting. If you also use qos or advanced filtering the margin is even lower.<br />So better keep your pc if possible.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the feedback. Exactly the kind of info I was hoping to find.</p><p>For NATing performance, my internet connection is 50Mbit/s so no performance issue to expect here. I was mentioning GB Ethernet just as the interfaces on my server. My ISP only serves me 50Mbit/s.</p><p>For Samba, I can currently go around 80MByte/s. So indeed it would be a quite important downgrade to go to 30MBytes/s. But I have only one PC connected by Ethernet to my server so I could think about it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>snk4ever</strong> on 11 Oct 2016, 18:04)</p>

					<p>Also look into the Turris Omnia. It&#039;s designed as a high-performance box to serve files, host sites, and even run multiple LXC containers. Target power consumption was 8W with wifi cards enabled.</p><p>It was crowd-funded through indiegogo <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/turris-omnia-hi-performance-open-source-router-security-network#/">https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/turr … -network#/</a></p><p>They met their goal by a factor of 10x, and are just beginning to deliver units.

There are so many types of such a gadget, i.e. <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1pcs-Energy-Power-Meter-Watt-Volt-Amp-Frequency-Monitor-Analyzer-230V-50Hz-Hot-Worldwide/32638047559.html">230V Digital Amp / Frequency / Volt / Watt / Energy Power Monitor Analyzer</a>, <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/2016-TS-1500-Electronic-Energy-Meter-LCD-Energy-Monitor-Plug-in-Electricity-Meter-for-AU-Plug/32648739992.html">TS-1500 Electronic Energy Meter / Monitor</a>, <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/domotica-interruptor-interrupteur-EU-Plug-Monitor-Analyzer-Power-Energy-Meter-Wattage-Voltage-Current-Frequency-Power-LCD/32635825090.html">EU Digital Volt / Amp / Watt meter with Power Analyzer</a>, etc. There is an option with a US plug, too. I got the later one free from a friend as a defective item, i.e. built-in battery does not hold the charge and the display will fade out after unplugged a day or so from the outlet. On top of Amp, Volt, Watt, and price/KWh, this inexpensive gadget also shows the AC line frequency and is capable of measuring the total power factor of (an) equipment(s) plugged into its outlet.</p>									</div>
