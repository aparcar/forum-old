					<p>Thanks for the tip. I have written a simple script to run upnpc and place two port forwards in the gateway router.

					<p>To answer my own (and anyone who stumbles on this thread) question. It would seem that Hans Dedecker submitted netifd patches back on November 19th 2013 that provides this capability. The link to the thread with all 8 patches provided can be found here:<br /><a href="https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/2013-November/022538.html">https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/ope … 22538.html</a></p><p>It doesn&#039;t appear that these patches were incorporated into AA from what I can tell.</p>									</div>

					<p>It would appear that the Hans Dedecker patches _did_ make it into the upstream netifd sources, but the default commit used by the tip of AA for the netifd package is old. You should be able to pick up these changes by changing which netifd commit hash you use (edit the package/netifd/Makefile in your copy of AA). I can&#039;t promise this won&#039;t break something, nor can I suggest which commit hash would be a stable hash to go with.&nbsp; The netifd commit hash that includes the Han patches is:<br />7335c3e19ea09674245dda3653d3f40705e68d6b</p><p>Hopefully someone with more experience can comment on more stable commit hash that includes these patches that should be used for AA. Thanks.</p>									</div>
