					<p>Are there any ADSL routers that I can use in the UK that are still in production? I need to buy a few openwrt compatible ADSL routers and cannot see any that are still available.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metalmickey123</strong> on 8 Jun 2010, 19:30)</p>

					<p>You can still find used AR7 routers around. Here is a (partial) <a href="http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/CategoryAR7Device.html">list of models</a>.<br />Unfortunately the AR7 platform is out of production, and the now-ubiquitous Broadcom ADSL routers that replaced them don&#039;t have open source drivers for their ADSL modem (though the rest of the hardware is supported by the brcm63xx OpenWrt port).</p><p>There seems to be another interesting ADSL platform still in production, and seems to have open drivers for ADSL and VoIP: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/target/linux/ifxmips">ifxmips</a>. I haven&#039;t been able to find informations about it or even a list of possibly working routers, so I don&#039;t know the current status of this port.</p>									</div>
