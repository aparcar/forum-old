					<p>I have the listed device. I would like to update the antenna&#039;s or access the rf output on this device. It is working and running DD-WRT v24-sp2 (04/15/13) std - build 21286.<br />Running fairly well except for the range due to the toy antenna&#039;s . I have done such things before but asking if anyone has done something like this. As it&#039;s working I don&#039;t want to kill it. Any info greatly appreciated. <br />Thanks all.</p>									</div>
