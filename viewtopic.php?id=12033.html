					<p>I was trying to create such a driver for FSG-3 (platform is the same).

					<p>This is a text form linux/Documentation/leds-class.txt and as far I&#039;ve examined /linux-2.6.21.6/arch/arm/mach-ixp4xx/nslu2-setup.c <br />this should work.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>LED handling under Linux<br />========================</p><p>If you&#039;re reading this and thinking about keyboard leds, these are<br />handled by the input subsystem and the led class is *not* needed.</p><p>In its simplest form, the LED class just allows control of LEDs from<br />userspace. LEDs appear in /sys/class/leds/. The brightness file will<br />set the brightness of the LED (taking a value 0-255). Most LEDs don&#039;t<br />have hardware brightness support so will just be turned on for non-zero<br />brightness settings.</p><p>The class also introduces the optional concept of an LED trigger. A trigger<br />is a kernel based source of led events. Triggers can either be simple or<br />complex. A simple trigger isn&#039;t configurable and is designed to slot into<br />existing subsystems with minimal additional code. Examples are the ide-disk,<br />nand-disk and sharpsl-charge triggers. With led triggers disabled, the code<br />optimises away.</p><p>Complex triggers whilst available to all LEDs have LED specific<br />parameters and work on a per LED basis. The timer trigger is an example.</p><p>You can change triggers in a similar manner to the way an IO scheduler<br />is chosen (via /sys/class/leds/&lt;device&gt;/trigger). Trigger specific<br />parameters can appear in /sys/class/leds/&lt;device&gt; once a given trigger is<br />selected.</p><br /><p>Design Philosophy<br />=================</p><p>The underlying design philosophy is simplicity. LEDs are simple devices<br />and the aim is to keep a small amount of code giving as much functionality<br />as possible.&nbsp; Please keep this in mind when suggesting enhancements.</p><br /><p>LED Device Naming<br />=================</p><p>Is currently of the form:</p><p>&quot;devicename:colour&quot;</p><p>There have been calls for LED properties such as colour to be exported as<br />individual led class attributes. As a solution which doesn&#039;t incur as much<br />overhead, I suggest these become part of the device name. The naming scheme<br />above leaves scope for further attributes should they be needed.</p><br /><p>Known Issues<br />============</p><p>The LED Trigger core cannot be a module as the simple trigger functions<br />would cause nightmare dependency issues. I see this as a minor issue<br />compared to the benefits the simple trigger functionality brings. The<br />rest of the LED subsystem can be modular.</p><p>Some leds can be programmed to flash in hardware. As this isn&#039;t a generic<br />LED device property, this should be exported as a device specific sysfs<br />attribute rather than part of the class if this functionality is required.</p><br /><p>Future Development<br />==================</p><p>At the moment, a trigger can&#039;t be created specifically for a single LED.<br />There are a number of cases where a trigger might only be mappable to a<br />particular LED (ACPI?). The addition of triggers provided by the LED driver<br />should cover this option and be possible to add without breaking the<br />current interface.</p></blockquote></div>									</div>
