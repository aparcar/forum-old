					<p>I&#039;m running mt-daapd to serve music on my home network. First i tried the mt-daapd 0.2.4.2 but it didn&#039;t read flac tags. So i compiled svn-1586 myself. It runs well, it also reads flac tags now.<br />When I play an MP3 file on an ubuntu client (rhythmbox) I can &quot;jump&quot; through one song (clicking the bar to make it play at 1:30 for example). When I play flac files (or ogg files) this is not possible. Does it have anything to do with the older libflac included in openwrt? Is it possible to make this work?</p>									</div>
