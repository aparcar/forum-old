					<p>Dan:</p><p>I can boot the board just fine with images built from the trunk using the serial port. The board type is BCM96348GW-10. All the peripherals work, including a second onboard flash, BCM4318 WLAN, and the BCM5325E (although since the MDI port not connected, we cannot control the QoS or setup VLANs with it). Florian is even working on the SPI and GPIO drivers because there are some other peripherals attached on that bus.</p><p>What I can&#039;t do, right now, is load the firmware image from the web user interface. For remote support of our users, we need to do be able to do that.</p><p>I hope you can help.</p><p>By the way, I bricked a board last week and using your tools, was able to restore it successfully.

					<p>I just added preliminary support for BCM6345 with changeset 14953 which should hopefully let you get a shell on the device. The Ethernet MAC on the BCM6345 is different from the one in the BCM6338/6348/6358 so we will have to wait a bit before fully supporting it. Enjoy !</p>									</div>

					<p>Hej!</p><p>I tried to run the new 6345 code on my SE515 with with patches from the mcbachmann site for the image building. So far no luck.

					<p>Ramponis:</p><p>If you want an ext2 or ext3, then you need to include it in the kernel under file systems. The advantage is that it&#039;s case sensitive and if you try to install or run Linux programs or modules from the flash, it will work. If you do include ext2 or ext3, you won&#039;t need the nls stuff, but I would recommend e2fsprog to format and maintain the drive, at least as a module.</p><p>marc.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think there was an issue loading the EHCI modules with CONFIG_USB_EHCI_ROOT_HUB_TT set. This should be fixed with [15020] and should now make ehci work as well on brcm6358.</p>									</div>
