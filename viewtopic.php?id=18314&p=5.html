I tried to turn it into a repeater so I changed the following files. But after the changes my laptop couldn&#039;t get DHCP IP from the router anymore, thus I couldn&#039;t login to the router using 192.168.1.1. Is it anyway I could reverse the changes? Or reset OpenWRT to its default settings? I tried pressing reset button and no luck. Please advise, thanks.

					<p>Success with client mode!</p><p>Compared to default settings and wiki, I had to add wan interface and play with firewall.<br />The firewall is in rough shape(wide open) and needs more tuning, please, anybody with experience, comment.<br />Wan interface works pretty good, associates with AP by dhcp and assigned ip address is shown in ifconfig.<br />The rate in iwconfig is 0 Mb/s or 1Mb/s which is wrong, pinging AP return in 2-3ms, ping google from terminal ~40-45ms and the same from PC 45-50ms.
