					<p>Right now my WRT54GL is very reliable and fits all my needs, but since my parents need a new router I&#039;m planning to give them my Linksys and buy something more up-to-date for me. I&#039;ve narrowed my search to these two models. They come at the same price (55€ circa) and AFAIK should be supported by OpenWrt.</p><p>Anyway, these are my requirements:<br />* well supported by OpenWrt community<br />* no issues / working out-of-the-box with OpenWrt<br />* home scenario with 4 to 5 clients, both LAN and WLAN (G only right now)<br />* not much traffic (just web and few SD streams, almost no p2p, no VoIP)<br />* wireless LAN must be reliable (no disconnections, decent range for an apartment)<br />* USB capabilities (printer/NAS) are welcome as a bonus, not a primary feature</p><p>[edit]Which one would you buy? TP-Link TL-WR1043ND or Buffalo [s]WHR-HP-G300N[/s] WZR-HP-G300N?</p><p>Price and reliability wise, should I just consider buying a new WRT54GL for my parents? It&#039;s less than 40€ now.</p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>arod0405</strong> on 2 Sep 2011, 20:37)</p>

					<p>I don&#039;t think WHR-HP-G300N is supported WZR-HP-G300NH is (Buffalo has some similar product names) which is somewhat more expensive, but has more RAM (64) than TP-Link.</p>									</div>

					<p>Oops! It&#039;s a typo! I meant Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH and it sells at 58€ with no shipping costs.</p><p>Please close this topic. I couldn&#039;t find a way to change the misleading title so I opened another.<br />Sorry!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>arod0405</strong> on 2 Sep 2011, 20:56)</p>
