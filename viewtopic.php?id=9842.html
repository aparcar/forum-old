					<p>I am a WRTSL54GS owner (and lover) and was about to purchase a second to use for testing upgrades, different releases, etc, when I stopped to consider the WRT350N.&nbsp; I see that there is recent support for the WRT350N by dd-wrt and soon by openwrt.&nbsp; </p><p>The two models are close: both 8Mb flash, 32Mb ram and usb 2, all features important to me.&nbsp; I&#039;ll admit that the wireless isn&#039;t as important to me as the ability to run Linux on the router, but the appeal of new technology, 802.11n, which should work with my Macbook Pro in the near future, is inviting.&nbsp; </p><p>The reviews of the WRT350N aren&#039;t very good, but I assume most of those problems are firmware based.&nbsp; I am a bit worried about the lack of a 802.11n standard, but not overly.</p><p>Thoughts?&nbsp; Opinions?&nbsp; Rants?&nbsp; Flames?&nbsp; Influence me, I&#039;m asking for it.</p>									</div>

					<p>The wrt350n has a faster, more optimized processor capable of routing at higher speeds, which is why I&#039;ve been eyeing it lately...&nbsp; I tested one recently, it was able to forward packets fast enough to saturate my 100mbit test network...</p>									</div>

					<p>What do people think about using a draft-n router?&nbsp; The official IEEE release for 802.11n is supposedly in May.&nbsp; Should there be much change for draft-n routers between then and now?&nbsp; And are those changes likely to be firmware or hardware based?&nbsp; Could they make the purchase of a draft-n router now obsolete in just two months?</p>									</div>

					<p>IMHO (as draft-N 2.0 is out) every draft-N device will support the final version with a firmware upgrade, like happened with the WRT54G (it was draft-802.11g only when released).</p>									</div>
