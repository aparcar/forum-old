					<p>Well, let&#039;s consider you are talking about OpenWRT on small routers (with some MB of disk). When using squashfs, there is a base filesystem (rom) and the changes (/overlay). The overlay is generally only modified when some config is changed or when a package is installed. As it is very small and does not change frequently, just hash it all, copy all its contents to remote storage every hour, anything.</p><p>As you are concern about security, you would need a external syslog server, as OpenWRT uses volatile storage for it.</p>									</div>
