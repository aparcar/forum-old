					<p>Hi, <br />I have a wdr4300 and the ethernet ports stoped work. With serial and wi-fi I can communicate with it.<br />I think its maybe some kind of interference. Because swconfig still works and I can change VLANs. I can use the four LAN ports to communicate between them too. And all the ports on swconfig statics receive and send bytes.</p><p>I use wireshark on my notebook and it can see the arp request of the router, the notebook send the anwser. But the router doesn&#039;t receive. Because the route send an arp request again.</p><p>But... If I use a ping request with only one byte, rarely I receive a confirmation.<br />Anyone know Whats happening? I think if I change the speed of the router to switch to 100mbps I can solve the problem. But I don&#039;t know how I can do this.</p><p>Another thing: The Wan port seems broken, when I power on the router the leds light up a few seconds, after the switch get hot, and it get very hot, the led goes off. And I can&#039;t use the wan port.</p><p>Can anyone help me?</p><p>Thanks, and sorry about my english. I tried to write without copy and paste on google translator.</p>									</div>
