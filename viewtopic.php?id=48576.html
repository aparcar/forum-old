					<p>Thanks. <br />Following the instructions in Part 2 does not result in internet access, not able to ping openwrt.org in Network, Diagnostics.<br />That is the problem.&nbsp; That is what I meant by &quot; I tried the usual way&quot;.&nbsp; The main router wifi get associated and I can access router via wifi.&nbsp; It looks OK, but no internet.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your help.&nbsp; I found problem!&nbsp; It was main router.&nbsp; I had to enable parental controls, managed devices, remove tp-link mac.&nbsp; Then I disabled parental controls, managed devices and it still pings.<br />I started with firewall log and then found the following post with one google search for &quot;DPC3939&quot; &quot;device blocked&quot; &quot;firewall&quot; that yielded one result. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=DPC3939+%22device+blocked%22+firewall">www.google.com/search?q=DPC3939+%22device+blocked%22+firewall</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kg27r1</strong> on 23 Jan 2014, 08:11)</p>
