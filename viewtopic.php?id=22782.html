					<p>I have a Belkin F5D8230-4.&nbsp; I replaced the Airgo Card with a Broadcom BCM94321MC.&nbsp; This is a dual band mini-PCI card (can only use 1 band at a time).&nbsp; So my hardware looks like this:</p><p>CPU - BCM4704@260mhz<br />Switch - Broadcom 5325<br />Radio - BCM4321</p><p>I can successfully flash and run DD-WRT every time.&nbsp; No problems except that I can&#039;t use the 5 ghz band of the card.&nbsp; This is because the Broadcom driver is not open source, although the binary is available.</p><p>So I decided to build a version of OpenWRT and install the kmod-brcm-wl-mimo.ipk which has the correct driver (for the 2.4 kernel).&nbsp; I am not sure but it sounds like Kamikaze might already have support.</p><p>Anyway, I have tried flashing all of these versions of OpenWRT:</p><p>Kamikaze 8.09.2-RC2 openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx&nbsp; <br />Kamikaze 7.09 openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx&nbsp; <br />WhiteRussian&nbsp; openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>In all cases, the flash is successful but I cannot get any response to a ping on 192.168.1.1.</p><p>I then flash back to DD-WRT and it works like a champ.</p><p>Before I go to the trouble of building OpenWRT, I wanted to get a version that *should* work going.</p><p>Just wondering if anyone has any ideas.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>rabinnh</p>									</div>

					<p>Hate to reply to myself, but . . . </p><p>I have tried for 2 days to flash with OpenWRT and failed, while successfully flashing DD-WRT repeatedly.&nbsp; Well, I finally got WhiteRussian flashed.&nbsp; And yes, I was stupid, once again taking something for granted.</p><p>I thought that I was being really careful, but just because I could flash various versions of the Belkin firmware and DD-WRT after clearing nvram with the reset button didn&#039;t mean that I could flash OpenWRT.&nbsp; For every&nbsp; OpenWRT flash, I have to flash to Belkin and then reload default settings from the Web interface.</p><p>Let that be a lesson to me.</p><p>Now I need to build my custom version.</p><p>rabinnh</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey, I know this thread hasn&#039;t seen any posts in a long time but I have a question for rabinnh, or anybody for that matter.&nbsp; I have the EXACT same setup, right down to the 3rd party BCM 4321 card.&nbsp; Does the latest version (Backfire 10.03) work with this setup and how do you configure it?&nbsp; Is there a web-interface to configure it or are we talking all command line stuff (total OpenWrt new person here, though I&#039;ve used DD WRT in the past).</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>									</div>
