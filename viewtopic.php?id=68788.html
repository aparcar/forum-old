					<p>Well, I had a breakthrough! The connection to the OpenWRT VPN server instance is successful (even with the client instance enabled) when adding this ugly ip rule:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ip rule add from all to y.y.y.y/y table no_vpn_cli priority 2</code></pre></div><p>the ugly part being that y.y.y.y/y is Lemmiwink&#039;s <em>public</em> network, which is not always the same!

For example, is it possible to do policy routing based on destination ports rather than on destination networks (preferably without iptables <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" />)? An ip rule like this one<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ip rule add from all to port 1194 table no_vpn_cli priority 2</code></pre></div><p>would probably solve my problem, but there&#039;s no &quot;port&quot; option in ip (also I&#039;m not sure the <em>entire</em> VPN session uses port 1194).</p>									</div>

					<p>Okay then. Sounds like your connectivity is due to asymmetric routing.</p><p>Basically what&#039;s happening is that when you try to connect to your server, it&#039;s receiving the connection attempt but is trying to send the reply out through the VPN provider rather than through eth0.</p><p>Fixing this isn&#039;t too hard. I haven&#039;t done this in the OpenWrt environment, but I encountered the same issue when I was trying to run a headless torrent box (a raspberry pi) that used a VPN (my previous ISP throttled my connection if BT traffic was detected). When the VPN was up, I couldn&#039;t connect to the control interface. I solved the issue using this code, which you should be able to modify for your purposes (I&#039;ve added comments to explain what&#039;s going on):<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#Incoming new connections created on the eth0 are given the arbitrary identification mark 0x1
iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -i eth0 -j CONNMARK --set-mark 0x1
#An arbitrarily, pre-created routing table (32) uses the eth0 (this was behind the router) as the default gateway
ip route add default via 192.168.1.1 table 32
#Connections we&#039;ve marked are routed through our table, meaning the responses to those new connections are leaving through the same door they came in.
ip rule add fwmark 0x1 table 32
#Clean up our mark after we&#039;re done
iptables -t mangle -A OUTPUT -m connmark --mark 0x1 -j CONNMARK --restore-mark</code></pre></div><p>Using this, any new connection being established on the eth0 interface will have its traffic properly routed through the eth0 interface. We don&#039;t have to worry about established or related connections, since networking will make sure those use the same routing table that the new connection was established on.</p><p>This should at least let clients connect to the sever. I haven&#039;t been in your exact situation, so I&#039;m not certain, but I believe you&#039;ll have to do this for both the eth0 interface as well as the VPN server interface that clients are connecting to.</p><p>Note that none of this is persistent, and will disappear after reboot, so you&#039;ll need to us route-up scripts or rc.local to get things to stay. On the upside, this makes it really easy to fix things if you screw up while testing and can&#039;t connect to your router anymore (which may happen because that code was for a very simple device that doesn&#039;t have like 18 different firewall chains going on - does OpenWrt have any packet marking going on by default that could cause overlap?).</p><p>Also remember that the functions I&#039;ve listed have nothing to do with whether the connection is actually accepted or not, just where to send it if it is. Firewalls gonna firewall.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ExaltedVanguard</strong> on 4 Dec 2016, 06:12)</p>

What you suggest seems exactly what I need but for some reason it&#039;s not working (iptables-mod-ipopt is installed). To be safe, I also tried using as table 32 an entire copy of the main routing table (without the VPN client modifications). I did the same thing for the VPN server interface, tun1, with a 0x2 mark. Nothing. I&#039;ll try with a port-based approach. The fact that this works when targeting connections from the client&#039;s public IP gives me some hope.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>endvour</strong> on 4 Dec 2016, 07:27)</p>

					<p>Solved.<br />No need for marking connections/packets, this simple ip rule is enough:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ip rule add from 192.168.1.2 table no_vpn_provider priority 100</code></pre></div><p>The problem is that an OpenVPN server doesn&#039;t bind to any specific IP address by default, so the above rule won&#039;t work unless one adds this line to the server configuration file<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>local 192.168.1.2</code></pre></div>									</div>
