					<p>Hi,ALL:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have used openwrt for some days.Till now i have knew that openwrt uses uci to manage all of other apps&#039;s configures through modifing configure files in /etc/config/*.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For example,ushare app.I can firstly use uci to modify configures in /etc/config/ushare.Then i use /etc/init.d/ushare script to restart ushare.When ushare is restarted,it will read newest configures from /etc/config/ushare.Now the whole process have been done.(Am i right?)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But there is a question.When i check the source code of ushare, I found that in ushare&#039;s MAIN function,it will read configures from /etc/ushare.conf but not /etc/config/ushare.Does anyone be familiar with the relationship between uci and other apps?Or my understand is wrong?Very appreciate for your reply!</p>									</div>

					<p>The init scripts take care of translating universal uci config into application specific native config formats, usually something like /var/etc/foo.conf or command line args.</p>									</div>
