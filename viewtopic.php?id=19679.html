					<p>Hey everyone,</p><p>It seems as though the wiki and bug tracker are going through some changes at the moment, so I thought I&#039;d ask the forum.</p><p>With 8.09, what is considered the &#039;correct&#039; way of setting up a usb-storage root filesystem on a Netgear WGT634U?&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried two different methods, one using /linuxrc &amp; pivot_root and the other replacing my /sbin/init with a shell script which loads /etc/config/bootfromexternalmedia.</p><p>They both actually work, but the problem is routes seem to be broken if the USB drive is used as the root FS.&nbsp; I can ping the gateway (and have dnsmasq .lan names &amp; routes) from the lan.&nbsp; From the router I can get to outside addresses, but from any box on the lan, I cannot get to wan addresses.&nbsp; If I boot w/o the USB drive, routes are fine.</p><p>Justin</p>									</div>
