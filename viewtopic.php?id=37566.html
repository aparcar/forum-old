					<p>I think I need help with setting up some rules with iptables. While setting up dansguardian and squid, I ran into an issue with Xbox Live.</p><p>I have squid listening on it&#039;s default port of 3128. Dansguardian is listening on 8080 and forwarding to squid.<br />I have the following rule in iptables so browsers on the lan will automatically hit the proxy:</p><p><strong>iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -m tcp -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080</strong></p><p>The problem with this is it breaks Xbox Live. I need a rule that allows my xbox to bypass the proxy.<br />Also, will the above rule only allow lan devices to hit the proxy? I don&#039;t want wan connections coming in, obviously. I&#039;m afraid I don&#039;t really know much about iptables.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Why mac? Just fix the ip of your xbox machine with a static IP address (in dhcp configuration).</p><p>You can either:<br />1) accept &quot;to port 80&quot; and &quot;from xbox&quot; before the line you posted.<br />2) limit the rule to ignore &quot;from xbox&quot;</p><p>Considering your xbox ip is 192.168.1.2</p><p>1) iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -m tcp -p tcp --dport 80 -s 192.168.1.2 -j ACCEPT<br />2) iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -m tcp -p tcp --dport 80 \! -s 192.168.1.2 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080</p><p>Regards</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks.<br />I guess I would choose option #1 because there&#039;s actually more than one xbox that needs to be allowed, and so I would need multiple rules before the redirect rule.</p><p>I tried filtering on the mac address, but I couldn&#039;t get it to work. Perhaps I wrote the rule incorrectly. Do you think it is possible to get it to work by mac address? I&#039;m curious even though I realize it isn&#039;t difficult to set up a dhcp reservation.</p>									</div>

					<p>The default policy for your PREROUTING chain might be ACCEPT. So, if it does not match any rules, it will be accepted anyway.<br />The filtering step will happen in another chain like FORWARD or INPUT, both in filter table.</p><p>The first rule is just to avoid the second one. So, If someone spoofs your mac, it will act like any other package that does not match the dport 80.</p><p>For the second rule, I would consider filtering from local LAN only. If a attacker sends from wan a request like <a href="http://192.168.1.2:80">http://192.168.1.2:80</a> to your router wan IP adress, it will redirect it to the proxy and it will act like a open proxy, even accessing internal address. The filter step happens after the package was redirected and probably will not be filtered.</p><p>I use very frequently this image as reference:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www.linuxhomenetworking.com/wiki/images/f/f0/Iptables.gif" alt="http://www.linuxhomenetworking.com/wiki/images/f/f0/Iptables.gif" /></span></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>luizluca</strong> on 20 Jun 2012, 17:32)</p>
