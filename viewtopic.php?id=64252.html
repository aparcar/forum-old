					<p>Hello all, this is a guide to installing openwrt on a WR841N(D) v9 (other versions and TP-Link router models should be similar)</p><p><strong>Initial TP-Link Setup </strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first thing you need to do is install the router in between your computer and your internet access.&nbsp; Then you can access the router by either using the mini CD provided with the router or by using the web GUI.&nbsp; The web GUI can be found at <a href="http://tplinklogin.net/">http://tplinklogin.net/</a> .&nbsp; <strong>*</strong>When accessing through the GUI I was prompted for a name and password.&nbsp; For mine they were both “admin” but yours might be different.&nbsp; A quick google search for default password with your model and version number should solve that problem.</p><p><strong>Download Openwrt Image</strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For WR841N(D) (all versions) you can find your image here: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd</a> <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For other router models you have to search the table of hardware: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start?dataflt%5BModel*%7E%5D=">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start?data … el*%7E%5D=</a> for your router version.&nbsp; From there click on the “Device Page” link.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Scroll down to INSTALLATION and choose the image beside the version number that matches the version number on your router.&nbsp; This is important!! If you chose the wrong version the router will not accept the image.</p><p><strong>Installing Openwrt Image on Router</strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; After the image has downloaded you must access the web GUI.&nbsp; It can be found here: <a href="http://tplinklogin.net/">http://tplinklogin.net/</a> (If you are having trouble accessing the web GUI refer to *).&nbsp; Now we need to navigate through the menu to Firmware Upgrade, or something along those lines.&nbsp; Here is where we install the Openwrt image we downloaded in the previous step. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On WR841N(D) v9 it brought me to a page with a box that I could link a file on my computer to, an upgrade button and all the information about the router model version and patch.&nbsp; put the image file in the box and hit upgrade to begin the flashing of the router.</p><p><strong>**PITFALL**</strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Please note that some TP-Link routers have a rudimentary safety against software modification.&nbsp; &nbsp;They will only accept a new file if the name of the file matches what a proper upgrade file would look like.&nbsp; On WR841N(D) users it will look something like this: “wr841nv9_en_19_12_4_up(150910).bin” without the quotations.&nbsp; Change the number beside the v (here it’s v9) to whatever version your router is.</p><p><strong>Installation Successful</strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If your installation was successful, congratulations you now have a router with openwrt firmware and all the networking possibilities that the openwrt unlocks.&nbsp; Navigate to 192.168.1.1 to access the new web GUI.&nbsp; It will prompt you for a root password and once you have created a password you are ready to begin customizing your router.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you are like me, it took a couple tries to install the firmware successfully, I’d be happy to help with any questions or problems you may be having.</p><p><strong>Where to go From Here</strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ok great, so I now have a router with openwrt but what does this mean?&nbsp; Well why don’t you check out these links to see all what openwrt can do for you:</p><p>Follow my experiences with Openwrt and trying to install a mesh network within my community:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=64240">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=64240</a></p><p>Check out Features:<br /> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenWrt">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenWrt</a></p><p>Great Resource!:<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/faq/after.installation">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/faq/after.installation</a></p>									</div>
