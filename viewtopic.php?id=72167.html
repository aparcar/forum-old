					<p>Hi,<br />I used the TP-LInk TL-WR740N router as client mode with the DD-WRT firmware, because it supports 802.1x PEAP security.</p><p>then I bought a TL-WA801ND to improve my signal, but it is not compatible with DD-WRT.</p><p>Searching the internet, I&#039;ve seen that OPEN-WRT is also compatible with 802.1x PEAP and&nbsp; I understand that I need a file called &quot;wpa_supplicant&quot; or &quot;hostapd&quot;. </p><p>But in the firmware I installed there are no such files. I tried installing it using a tutorial I found, but there is an error:<br />&quot;Collected errors:<br />  * wfopen: LINK/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/generic/packages/base/hostapd_2016-06-15-1_ar71xx.ipk:] No such file or directory.<br />  * pkg_init_from_file: Failed to extract control file from LINK/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/generic/packages/base/hostapd_2016-06-15-1_ar71xx.ipk.&quot;</p><p>I did not understand why the developers of OPEN-WRT complicated something so simple. In DD-WRT simply connect and choose the desired security.</p><p>Even if I can solve my problem with your help, I would like to leave a question to simplify this.</p><p>Thank you very much!</p>									</div>

					<p>Compromises needed to be made to have a standard build that still fits in devices with a 4 MB flash chip.</p><p>You didn&#039;t say if you need an 802.1X compatible AP, station, or both.&nbsp; The general purpose solution is package wpad.&nbsp; &nbsp;The wpad binary can be run in two modes, as hostapd for AP functions, and as wpa-supplicant for client functions.&nbsp; Remove the package wpad-mini and replace it with wpad which is the full version.&nbsp; Since the WA-801 has a 4 MB flash chip, that will require using the Image Builder to make a custom image.&nbsp; Possibly other things will need to be removed to make space.&nbsp; ppp and ipv6 are commonly removed if your network does not use them.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 27 Sep 2017, 16:04)</p>

					<p>Hi, I said at the beginning that I use the router as a client. Then I&#039;ll need the wpa.supplicant. Can you send me a tutorial about a Image Builder ?</p>									</div>
