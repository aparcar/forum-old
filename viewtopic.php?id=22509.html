					<p>Did you flash a image with luci included? </p><p>In this case: Have you tried accessing the router with telnet? <br />&#039;telnet 192.168.1.1&#039; should give you a console.

					<p>Unfortunately I think you missed the warning about OpenWRT for WRT160NL being a work-in-progress (see <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt160nl">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt160nl</a> ) - if you&#039;re new to OpenWRT I reckon rolling back to the original Linksys firmware is definitely your best plan of action.</p><p>I haven&#039;t tried rolling back to the Linksys firmware myself, but I have used the following method to flash a newer version of OpenWRT in the past and don&#039;t see why it should be any different:</p><p>-Download the Linksys original firmware from <a href="http://downloads.linksysbycisco.com/downloads/firmware/WRT160NL_v1.00.01.17_code.bin">http://downloads.linksysbycisco.com/dow … 7_code.bin</a> and save it to your desktop</p><p>-Install WinSCP from <a href="http://winscp.net/eng/download.php">http://winscp.net/eng/download.php</a></p><p>-Run WinSCP and enter 192.168.1.1 as the host, root as the username, administrator as the password and choose &#039;SCP&#039; as the file protocol from the drop-down box</p><p>-Choose Yes to add the key to the cache and click &#039;OK&#039; to any error messages about groups. The right hand pane should now show /root.</p><p>-Clicking on &#039;..&#039; in the right pane should bring up a list of folders &#039;bin&#039; &#039;dev&#039; &#039;etc&#039; ...</p><p>-Double click on the &#039;tmp&#039; folder in the right pane and find your desktop in the left pane, double click on WRT160NL_v1.00.01.17_code.bin to transfer it over.</p><p>-Run PuTTy from WinSCP by pressing CTRL + P, it should prompt you for a password and then login to the same prompt you had when you used telnet (telnet will be disabled now that you&#039;ve set a password)</p><p>-A tip just before you read the next line - if you start typing a filename in Linux and press TAB, it will auto-complete the filename in that directory. </p><p>-Type &#039;sysupgrade -n /tmp/WRT160NL_v1.00.01.17_code.bin&#039; and press ENTER</p><p>Hopefully that will reflash the original Linksys firmware.</p><p>I recommend experimenting with OpenWRT on a fully supported router, or waiting a few weeks until the ready-build images are in a more complete state.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry about that, I thought PuTTy must be packaged with WinSCP</p><p>You can get it from <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgta … nload.html</a> and presumably put it in that directory, otherwise just run it seperately and use 192.168.1.1 and the username root and password administrator.</p>									</div>

					<p>staylo - Thank a lot, it helped me also, I had same problem as djpettsey. I need to use WRT160NL as WiFi repeater. I have now WRT54GL with DD-WRT in this configuration, but I didn&#039;t find it for WRT160NL. Do you know about some functional firmware for WRT160NL with repeater WiFi mode please?</p>									</div>

					<p>if by repeater you meant &quot;Client Bridge&quot; then I don&#039;t think it is possible yet. That is what I have been waiting for.</p><p>The IC that performs as the gigabit switch needs to have a driver so the vlan tagging can be setup for this to work. I am sort of able to get 1 single device to use this as a bridge by simply configuring the wireless and the ethernet ports to all be on the same subnet. So I can bridge one single computer.</p>									</div>
