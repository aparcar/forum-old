					<p>hi all,<br />I have a Linksys WRT54G/GS/GL , with openwrt Backfire 10.03.1-RC6 / LuCI 0.10 Branch (0.10+svn7859) .<br />I noticed that from all wifi clients I can not resolv intranet dns requests from a separate dns server that I have . see here :&nbsp; <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=54374">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=54374</a></p><p>The connection of a wifi client to the intranet dns&nbsp; server is as follows:<br />wifi client ----&gt; antenna of wrt54 to switch port #1 -&gt;-&gt;-&gt; dns server<br />where <br />---&gt; is wireless connection and<br />-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; is wired connection.</p><p>now, I plugged in a pc at switch port #2 and &quot;nslookup pc1&quot; works fine. so only from wifi i can not resolv dns.</p><p>is it possible that some packet redirection is not setup correctly? maybe something is wrong with the wl0 &amp; eth0.0 bridge?<br />apart from dns , i seem to connect to the internet without any problem from the wifi clients.</p><p>thank you in advance for your help..</p>									</div>

					<p>To use your router as a simple bridge from wireless to wired, delete the wan interface and connect everything to lan.&nbsp; And turn OFF the router&#039;s dhcp server.&nbsp; (set option ignore &#039;1&#039; under lan in dhcp configuration).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 6 Dec 2014, 05:45)</p>

					<p>hey there, <br />and thank you for the reply,<br />dhcp is certainly offline ( dhcp.lan.ignore=1 ) and the problem persists.<br />But I think you may also have assumed a different yopology for my network than the one I currently have setup.</p><p>The device gets its internet connectivity from an ethernet port and allows wireless clients to have access to the intranet and internet.<br />I am just clarifying that because I think you assume my topology here to be that openwrt device gets its internet and intranet connectivity from another wifi access point which is not the case.</p><p>No matter, the problem persists. <br />any other ideas?</p>									</div>
