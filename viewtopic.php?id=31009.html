					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m quite frustrated with the firmware of my STEREN COM-840 WLAN router (<a href="http://www.steren.com/redes/interior3.asp?pdto=COM-840">http://www.steren.com/redes/interior3.asp?pdto=COM-840</a>) and would like to try OpenWrt.</p><p>Firmware Version: 3.9.17 Build 091118 Rel.36350n<br />Hardware Version: COM-840 v1 00000000</p><p>I have tried the OpenWrt image which was recommended for the TP-Link WR1043ND, a router with the same firmware: openwrt-ar71xx-tl-wr1043nd-v1-squashfs-factory.bin.</p><p>Unfortunately I get the error message:<br />Error code: 18005<br />Upgrade unsuccessfully because the version of the upgraded file was incorrect. Please check the file name.</p><p>Any ideas?</p><p>Thanks, Robert</p>									</div>
