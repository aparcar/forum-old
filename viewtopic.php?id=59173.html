					<p>IPv6 here sort of works: test sites report near perfect score and Google (which prefers v6) works fine on all services.</p><p>However, I noticed that &quot;dig&quot; will fail if I ask &quot;-6&quot; without an explicit server, be that my local router/DNS or Google&#039;s own servers.</p><p>It seems the internal hosts are not told about the v6 DNS server on the router. Is it because I don&#039;t have radvd installed?<br />( <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/ipv6.dns">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/ipv6.dns</a> )</p><p>Incidentally, there is a luci-app-radvd which is not installable because radvd itself is missing.</p><p>Is my understanding correct or am I looking in the wrong direction?</p><p>Thanks,<br />A.</p>									</div>

					<p>i think radvd was replaced by dhcp6, so its not used anymore,<br />is it just dig that doesn&#039;t work or any actual sites?</p><p>When i setup my ipv6, using Tunnelbroker, i had to manually set googles dns into my resolve file, as the one that was set couldn&#039;t resolve any ipv6 domains.</p>									</div>
