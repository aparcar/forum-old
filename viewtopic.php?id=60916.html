					<p>Hi everybody! I need some explanations and advises.<br />I have got chinese router zbt-wg2626, it is based on MT7621AT. Out of the box it runs modified Pandora, chinese fork of OpenWrt 14.07 . Original opkg.config file has links to <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/barier_bracker/14.07/ramips/mt7621/packages/*">https://downloads.openwrt.org/barier_br … packages/*</a>&nbsp; But there are no such paths!<br />I have changed them to <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05/ramips/mt7621/packages/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal … /packages/</a> * and performed opkg update.<br />Now I need to install x2ltp or openl2tp packages with all dependencies. But opkg tells that there are no available packages for my architecture ! </p><p>Then I add arch ramips_1004kc option to opkg.conf file.</p><p>Now I have got errors like that:<br />Collected errors: <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> * satisfy_dependencies_for: Cannot satisfy the following dependencies for xl2tpd: 
 *      libc *  libc *  kernel (= 3.18.23-1-90c11388edf87a49b8c3ec0bdd7de843) *         kernel (= 3.18.23-1-90c11388edf87a49b8c3ec0bdd7de843) *         kernel (= 3.18.23-1-90c11388edf87a49b8c3ec0bdd7de843) *      kernel (= 3.18.23-1-90c11388edf87a49b8c3ec0bdd7de843) *         kernel (= 3.18.23-1-90c11388edf87a49b8c3ec0bdd7de843) *      kernel (= 3.18.23-1-90c11388edf87a49b8c3ec0bdd7de843) *         kernel (= 3.18.23-1-90c11388edf87a49b8c3ec0bdd7de843) *         kernel (= 3.18.23-1-90c11388edf87a49b8c3ec0bdd7de843) *      libc * 
 * opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package xl2tpd.  </code></pre></div><p>What should I do? Do I need to make binaries from source codes or there is another way? Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>You cannot install packages built for a different version of OpenWrt. And trying to install packages for a different subsystem generally does not work either. The errors are perfectly normal and may even have prevented you from damaging your system.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 15 Nov 2015, 15:29)</p>

					<p>risk, I do not have sources right now, but maybe I will get it later (I wrote a letter to vendor), but I don&#039;t think that it&#039;s something special :-) You can check that site for sources <a href="https://openwrt.org.cn/wiki">https://openwrt.org.cn/wiki</a> and that for packages <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org.cn/">http://downloads.openwrt.org.cn/</a> </p><p>metai, thanks for reply. </p><p>Fortunately now there is sysupgrade bin file for my router in trunk, so I think that now everything will be fine!</p>									</div>
