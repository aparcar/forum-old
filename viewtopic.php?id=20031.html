					<p>Hi There!</p><p>I have a wl500gx running for a long time, with one serial port. I used an old nokia 5110 datacable. This works great. The cable has three wires, tx,rx and gnd.</p><p>I needed a second serial port, so I ordered another cable, only 6210 cables were available. I was a bit suprised, there was a fourth wire inside. (red)<br />I wired everything the same, and connected the red wire to 3,3volt as stated on several forums. </p><p>Unfortunately, it&#039;s not working. If I use the other cable, everything is fine. I used the correct pins to the correct wires. </p><p>What could be wrong? I assume the new cable is DLR-3, and the one I had already is DAU-9P.</p><p>I already tried to use another 6210 cable, but this is not going to work either. I don&#039;t have a 6210 or equivalent to test the cable in the original status. </p><p>I&#039;ve also tried to supply 5volt to the red wire, but it&#039;s still not working.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have VCC wire, I think it is the red one. I think there must be some sort of signal from pc, before the cable will be ready to communicate. I&#039;m trying to order some DAU-9P (nokia 5110) cables now, because I&#039;m sure these cables work.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mistraller</strong> on 25 Apr 2009, 21:39)</p>
