					<p>OK, I figured out my problem... it was stuck on firstboot (not automatically rebooting) when I telnet&#039;d into it.&nbsp; The problem on the next boot was that I had built in a revised lan config in /etc/config/network (with files/etc/config/network during build) and during the reboot to second boot, OpenWRT returned /etc/config/network lan config to 192.168.1.1 so it was now on a different subnet IP range than my workstation!&nbsp; Once I used DHCP and noticed that it had changed to another subnet, I was able to get back in and restore my intended config.</p><p>Is this expected that firstboot overwrites customized configuration that has been built into the image?</p>									</div>
