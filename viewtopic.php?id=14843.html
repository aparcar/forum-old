					<p>This idea was spawned when my uncle became unable to physically accomplish a portion of his job.&nbsp; Why not build a robot from the ground up?&nbsp; So, with a little brainstorming (that lasted well over a year), the idea to use a wireless router as the &quot;brains&quot; of this project came about.&nbsp; I had read about running optimized Linux distributions on these devices and started researching various devices and came across one that met all the requirements that I had in mind (ASUS WL-500g Premium):<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1) Affordable: not more than $90 on Newegg.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2) Dual external USB2 ports: one for webcam, the other for external storage.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3) Memory: can&#039;t have enough! With 32MB RAM and 8MB of flash, it is highly upgradeable.</p><p>Doing a little research, I came across a website (<a href="http://yasha.okshtein.net/wrt54g/">LINK</a>) that interfaced a Linksys WRT54GS to a cheap RC car using an H-Bridge attached to an I2C port expander through the GPIO pins on the router.&nbsp; Currently, I am looking at using solid state relays to drive the motors.&nbsp; Running the whole show is a stripped down compile of OpenWRT from the SVN.&nbsp; So far everything has gone smoothly, the only real issues I&#039;m having are finding documentation on the GPIO pins on this router (along with how to interface with them through a kernel-mode driver, though I&#039;m sure I should check out the source for MMC mods), and a reliable method of providing a stable 5v at 2.5A.</p><p>Also, if anyone has any constructive criticism on any of my ideas, please, feel free to send them my way.</p><p><a href="http://silverfox.furrynet.com/wifibot/">Development blog</a><br /><a href="http://i21.photobucket.com/albums/b252/silverfox-furry/wifibot/">Photo blog</a></p><p>Edit: Added WRT54GS rc car mod link<br />Edit: Changed amperage to reflect AC adapter</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bikedude880</strong> on 11 Mar 2008, 18:41)</p>

					<p>Take a look at Phidgets; they&#039;ll let you do pretty much anything your heart desires with a bit of your own custom coding. The basic Phidgets interface code should compile under openWRT without too much hassle, though I haven&#039;t gotten around to trying it myself yet so I don&#039;t know for certain. (I compiled it on my ARM-based Nokia N800 tablet without any problems at all so I don&#039;t think openWRT will be any more difficult than that!). There&#039;s a vast number of sensors, actuators, relays/etc all available to standard kits that connect to the USB port; full documenation and lots of examples are also available on how to use &#039;em under Linux (and everything else for that matter).<br /><a href="http://www.phidgets.com">www.phidgets.com</a></p><p>Good luck on the project!</p><p>-Rob</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the link jolouis, I&#039;ll look into it.&nbsp; Right now I&#039;m held up with the whole &quot;do I want wireless or a webcam&quot; phase which can easily be remidied by an Atheros card.&nbsp; Other than that, I&#039;ve received the &quot;prototype&quot; base for the whole thing (of which I will be posting pictures of shortly) a few days ago and am thoroughly impressed with the quality of workmanship it shows.</p><p>Personally I&#039;ve been thinking about controlling the whole thing with an h-bridge hooked up to a bit-bashing I2C bus on the GPIO pins, as I&#039;m not too concerned about overall performance right now so much as total cost.&nbsp; With regards to the power supply, the router (and possible USB hub) will have a dedicated 12v supply (regulated down to the 5v needed) and a seperate battery pack for the motors. </p><p>After that, all that is needed is a server-client program to run the show.&nbsp; The client program will connect to the server via a UDP socket (gotta love streaming interfaces), poll a joystick device for direction, send the commands in hex form to the server program, where they will be sent to the correct I2C device.&nbsp; A second server program (seperate from the control interface) will poll a USB webcam (360 degree &quot;doughnut&quot;) and send it along to the client (where it will be flattened out) via a second UDP socket.&nbsp; This video stream will be displayed in the client&#039;s window for navigation use.&nbsp; If I really feel inspired I could have a second webcam to take small snapshots of the surrounding environment and store it on a USB flash drive (hello powered USB hub).</p><p>Other than all that, I&#039;m looking forward to getting this project moving a bit faster now. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bikedude880</strong> on 25 Mar 2008, 22:51)</p>

					<p>Good luck on it! Certainly sounds much more challenging from a software point of view than anything else. If you&#039;ve got an Atheros card on the way just install 2.6 with atheros support and get the webcam working/software going; worst case scenario after all is to add a USB wifi adapter if nothing else. You&#039;ll have to be careful with the power to; the Asus is pretty smart in that it monitors the input voltage and shuts down/refuses to power itself if the voltage is over 5.25 or under 4.75V, but if you&#039;re running of battery power (depending on the size of the thing you&#039;re building here) you&#039;ll want to make sure you get an efficient switching power regulator that will be able to drop the 12V to 5V AND handle the amperage required (the WL-500GP with wifi and no USB devices looks for about 1.6-1.7A @ 5V; connecting USB devices obviously adds more to that).</p><p>-Rob</p>									</div>
