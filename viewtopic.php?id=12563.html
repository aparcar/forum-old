					<p>how can I create a span port on openwrt? its also called a &quot;monitoring port&quot; or &quot;tap port&quot;. Its used to plug in a computer running a network sniffer on it. This port is neccessary to be configured in a switch in order to listen all the traffic generated by other computers connected to other ports in the same switch. I have been looking for information about this on the forum but the only thing I found was this <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=4256">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=4256</a>. The other solution would be to add an iptable or ebtable rule to duplicate each packet going through the router and got it directed to the ip of the computer running the network sniffer, but How can I accomplish this???. Thanks in advance.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>homero</strong> on 19 Sep 2007, 06:13)</p>
