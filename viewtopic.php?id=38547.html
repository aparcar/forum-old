					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m having an issue with cross-compilation (and I am also brand new at this) for a router running OpenWrt Backfire 10.03.1 / LuCI 0.10.0 Release (0.10.0) using this SDK (OpenWrt-SDK-ar71xx-for-Linux-i686-gcc-4.3.3+cs_uClibc-0.9.30.1). I&#039;m simply trying to compile a &quot;helloworld&quot; program (for testing purposes because once this works, I will actually cross-compile the code I&#039;ve been working on aka this is just so I know how the whole cross-compilation process works with a simple program). The reason I&#039;m asking this to you guys is because I&#039;m actually following a tutorial (<a href="http://manoftoday.wordpress.com/2007/10/11/writing-and-compiling-a-simple-program-for-openwrt/">http://manoftoday.wordpress.com/2007/10 â€¦ r-openwrt/</a>) which supposedly works and has been tested... even seems to have positive feedback and I&#039;m still getting an error when I attempt the &quot;make V=99&quot; command after copy/pasting my &quot;helloworld&quot; folder inside the &quot;package&quot; directory within the SDK directory. I then make the actual Makefile needed to compile and I get a message saying to fix this recent Makefile.&nbsp; Anyways, this is the Makefile...</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>include $(TOPDIR)/rules.mk

PKG_NAME:=helloworld
PKG_RELEASE:=1

PKG_BUILD_DIR:=$(BUILD_DIR)/$(PKG_NAME)

include $(INCLUDE_DIR)/package.mk

define Package/helloworld
    SECTION:=net
    CATEGORY:=Base system
    TITLE:=helloworld
    DESCRIPTION:=Prints helloworld message
endef

define Build/Prepare
    mkdir -p $(PKG_BUILD_DIR)
    $(CP) ./src/* $(PKG_BUILD_DIR)/
endef

define Package/helloworld/install
    $(INSTALL_DIR) $(1)/bin
    $(INSTALL_BIN) $(PKG_BUILD_DIR)/helloworld $(1)/bin/
endef

$(eval $(call BuildPackage,helloworld))</code></pre></div><p>This is the output I receive after I input &quot;make V=99&quot;...</p><p><strong><br />test@bt:/root/OpenWrt-SDK-ar71xx-for-Linux-i686-gcc-4.3.3+cs_uClibc-0.9.30.1$ make V=99<br />ERROR: please fix package/helloworld/Makefile<br />[output omitted]<br /></strong></p><p>Could someone please tell me what&#039;s wrong with the above Makefile? Am I missing a statement... anything? I would of thought it would of worked since it looked like it contains the minimum required variable declarations/assignments but seems like something is wrong.&nbsp; I would greatly appreciate any help since this cross-compilation problem is halting any progress for my actual program that I am developing for my work.</p><p>Thanks in adavance and cheers,</p><p>J33ZER</p>									</div>
