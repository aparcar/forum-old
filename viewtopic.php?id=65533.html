					<p>The default configuration for OpenWrt has wifi disabled; you need to connect using a cable and enable it.<br />And all &quot;trunk&quot; versions of OpenWrt lack the admin interface LuCi, you need to install it afterwards.</p>									</div>

					<p>What do you exactly mean by &quot;admin panel&quot;? The text terminal, or the web interface?<br />Which exact version did you install? Is it a stable release or is it a trunk release?</p><p>You need to use an ehternet cable, then connect using TELNET.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Eduperez,,</p><p>Admin panel is the web interface of TP-Link wa901nd. (192.168.1.1 via google chrome with cable, standart methode)</p><p>In that admin panel of the TP link wa901nd I installed firmware to use openwrt. (succesfull completed installation)</p><p>its a trunk I think: <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/generic/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots … x/generic/</a></p><p>/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/generic/</p><p>download file: openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wa901nd-v4-squashfs-factory.bin</p><p>After installation this file, I could not use the wifi accespoint. Only wan cable does work. </p><p>Today I installed ubuntu server(lucid the gui) in virtualbox with OpenSSH and Lamp Server and then I stopped <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" />. </p><p>I just want to use hotspot in my new router (TPLINK). If a customer would like to use internet, he/she has first log in to social media(like/share/reviews) or email adres to use free hotspot internet. After that I would like to monitoring/analyzing..etc.</p><p>But now im testing with a tplink routers.. if its works i will do for all routers.</p><p>Im not an expert in developing, im a sales/marketeer expert <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /><br />But i know little bit about routers ^^</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, so the &quot;admin panel&quot; in OpenWrt is called LuCi, and it is not installed on &quot;trunk&quot; versions. Do you have any reason not to use the latest stable release? On the other hand, wifi is disabled by default on all versions of OpenWrt, so your first connection must be done using a cable.</p><p>I just hope you did not confuse OpenWrt&#039;s LuCi with Ubuntu&#039;s Lucid, because they are completely unrelated.</p><p>Have a look at the following guides to understand what tasks are you expected to perform now:<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/firstlogin">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/firstlogin</a><br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/basic.config">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/basic.config</a></p>									</div>

					<p>LuCi wont fit in a&nbsp; 4MB router, you have to sysugrade and flash a bin from Chaos Calmer or Barrier Braker I advise BB, and have to be done via WinSCP and Putty if you are Linux read here <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=65543">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=65543</a></p>									</div>

I have to install sysugrade and flash a bin from Barrier Braker...</p><p>im going to research sysugrade and flash a bin from barrier braker. Im not a linux expert... Its very difficult to use openwrt with LuCi for now.. </p><p>A question, I see some codes: </p><p>sysupgrade -v /tmp/filename-of-downloaded-sysupgrade.bin</p><p>opkg update<br />opkg install luci</p><p>opkg install luci-ssl # enable https for luci</p><p>Where I have put this codes and at the same time put my TPlink router utp cable in my laptop? </p><p>I have to use terminal (ios mac)? or msdos (windows)? or ubuntu server?</p><p>I have installed ftfp server, ubuntu server, webmim but its not use full..</p><p>Im trying everything and i will not give up and reading 3 times to understand. Iv no problem with that. So give me please advice and I will do it!</p>									</div>
