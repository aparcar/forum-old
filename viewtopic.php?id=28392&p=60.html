					<p>Yeah, I will probably file a bug at LEDE.<br />Yes, the network disappear from all clients, only 5GHz is visible and connectable (obviously only on those devices that support 5GHz networks)<br />For some reason the web interface showed that the interface was not only active, but had some clients connected (smartphones). Sadly I did not check all smartphones if they still had connectivity, but mine didn&#039;t.</p>									</div>

It basically wipes the one partition openwrt/lede use for persistent variable storage. If this partition is empty you will only see the default files from the read-only /rom part of the firmware, any changes you make (for non tmpfs backed directories) will typically create overlay files to appear in that partition.</p><p>About sysupgrade -n<br />If you use the command line to upgrade your router the procedure you would follow is something like:<br />1) copy the new firmware image to the /tmp folder on your router:<br />scp WNDR3700v2-lede-r1512-20160905-1601-sqfs-sysupgrade.bin root@192.168.1.1:/tmp</p><p>2) log into the router:<br />ssh root@192.168.1.1</p><p>3) change into the folder containing the new firmware image:<br />cd /tmp</p><p>4) actually initiate the firmware upgrade (the router will reboot after it is done):<br />sysupgrade ./WNDR3700v2-lede-r1512-20160905-1601-sqfs-sysupgrade.bin</p><p>If called in that fashion the firmware upgrade will try to keep all your configuration files intact over the re-flash and reboot, so that your router&#039;s name, BSIDs passwords and what not will just stay as you configured it (what unfortunately is not conserved over the re-flash are additional packages you might have installed manually, you need to re-install these manually after each re-flash). <br />If you use &quot;sysupgrade -n ./WNDR3700v2-lede-r1512-20160905-1601-sqfs-sysupgrade.bin&quot; instead the router will not keep your existing configuration files (but wipe the persistent variable data partition) and hence will need to be reconfigured from scratch. But see <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.sysupgrade">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.sysupgrade</a> and <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/sysupgrade">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/sysupgrade</a> for further reference...</p><p>Best Regards</p>									</div>

					<p>Dear moeller,</p><p>Thank you for the useful and detailed post. I really appreciate you writing all that out for me. I had searched the wiki before asking but it was not clear to me, but now I got it 100%.</p><p>One last question, does firstboot and sysupgrade -n basically do the same thing? Like since I want to update my firmware I would just flash via sysupgrade -n... or do I need to run the firstboot command after it is finished flashing via sysupgrade -n command?</p><p>Thank You!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ZzBloopzZ</strong> on 8 Sep 2016, 19:09)</p>

					<p>Yes, firstboot wipes the r/w partition with all changes, settings etc., so it reverts the router to the situation like the previous firmware upgrade would have been done without preserving settings. So, doing sysupgrade without preserving settings leads to the same situation as firstboot.</p><p>The background is that firmware gets written into a read-only partition /rom and all your settings &amp; later changes are written to a read/write partition ( /overlay ) , which is shown as an overlay on top of the rom-part in a live router. Just wiping the overlay part (e.g. with firstboot) reverts the router into pristine condition as it would have been just flashed.</p><p>In practice, Luci runs &quot;firstboot&quot; for Reset menu selection, and for sysupgrade Luci runs &quot;sysupgrade&quot; with/without &quot;-n&quot; depending on your selection of keeping settings when upgrading.</p><p>If you use Luci for sysupgrade , just deselect the &quot;Keep settings&quot; tickbox to start from a clean slate.</p>									</div>
