					<p>Hi all, I&#039;m new here. Hoping someone can help. I&#039;ve got a basic Arris modem with a TP link router. I&#039;ve got a 100 MBit ISP plan, but periodically my wifi connection speed slows down to a craw and I have to reset my router by unplugging it. In an effort to fix this, I installed OpenWrt on the router, but it has not helped. I tried to do some troubleshooting next time that it happened, but the OpenWrt GUI showed that the bitrate on the network and Rx/Tx rates for my specific device are still high: imgur.com/BZ93O9T</p><p>How do I explain that my internet speed is abysmal? What can I do to troubleshoot further? <br />imgur.com/6qhfz06</p><br /><p>Modem: &nbsp; &nbsp; ARRIS SURFboard SB6141<br />Router: &nbsp; &nbsp; TP-Link TL-WR841N/ND v9</p>									</div>
