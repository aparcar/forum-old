					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to set up WDS on 2 Atheros based routers<br />WDS Master is running 12.09<br />WDS Client is running 14.07<br />I&#039;ve read both <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode</a> and <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds</a></p><p>My issue is I&#039;m not getting a full signar bar on my computer even though the WDS Client is sitting next to the computer</p><p>What I did<br />On WDS Master<br />1. Perform reset<br />2. On Wifi General Setup tab, ESSID is set (let&#039;s call it mywdswifi), Mode: Access Point (WDS), Network: lan is checked, WMM Mode checked, on Wireless Security tab, encryption mode and passphrase is set, on MAC-Filter tab, MAC-Address Filter is disable<br />3. My computer can connect to WDS Master via wifi just fine, getting 2-3 signal bars</p><p>On WDS Client<br />1. Perform reset<br />2. Set LAN IP to 192.168.1.2 (WDS Master is 192.168.1.1), disable LAN DHCP server<br />3. On Wifi General Setup tab, ESSID is set to WDS Master&#039;s ESSID (mywdswifi), Mode: Client (WDS), Network: lan is checked, on Wireless Security tab, encryption mode and passphrase is set to the same as WDS Master&#039;s</p><p>I ssh to both routers, checked /etc/config/wireless that option wds is 1 on both</p><p>On WDS Client, I can see that it can connect to mywdswifi, on Wireless Overview SSID: mywdswifi | Mode: Client<br />If I connect to mywdswifi via wifi, I can access both 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.2<br />On WDS Master, I can see WDS Client&#039;s LAN MAC address under Associated Stations</p><p>I&#039;m using WDS to extend coverage (instead of buying an extender), but it doesn&#039;t matter if I disable or enable the wifi interface on the WDS Client I&#039;m still getting 2-3 signal bars for mywdswifi, even though the WDS Client router is placed next to the computer. <br />I would expect to get a full signal ?<br />Can I or how do I determine whether my computer is connected to WDS Client and WDS Client is relaying my packets to WDS Master or the other way around ?</p>									</div>

					<p>I went through this a couple of days ago, from what you explained I can understand how you can connect to the wds client. When the WDS connection is made the client device just acts as a bridge and it&#039;s not possible to connect to it from the network any longer without disconnecting it... How exactly is your setup? In my case it was:</p><p>[ISPModem]--cable--[WDS AP]- - -wireless - - -[WDS Client]---cable---[PC]</p>									</div>

					<p>I might be missunderstanding WDS, I&#039;m under the impression that with WDS, my computer can still connect to the WDS Client via wireless</p><p>On <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode,">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode,</a> specifically this image <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/_media/doc/recipes/wds.png,">http://wiki.openwrt.org/_media/doc/recipes/wds.png,</a> if OpenWrt Router 1 is the WDS Master and OpenWrt Router 2 is the WDS Client, I assume WLAN Host 1 can connect to OpenWrt Router 2 via wireless, when that host physically moves somewhere near OpenWrt Router 1 it would connect to OpenWrt Router 1 seamlessy (without changing its IP address), I thought that&#039;s how WDS work.</p><p>Your configuration <br />[ISPModem]--cable--[WDS AP]- - -wireless - - -[WDS Client]---cable---[PC]<br />I think this can be achieved just by setting the WDS Client router to just Mode: Client, instead of Mode: Client (WDS) ? <br />In your configuration, your PC is in the same subnet as WDS AP</p><p>If configuration is like this<br />[ISPModem]--cable--[WDS AP]- - -wireless - - -[Client]---cable---[PC] (that&#039;s Mode: Client not Mode: Client (WDS))<br />Depending on which network you are attaching the wireless interface to:<br />If it is on wwan then PC will be on a different subnet and traffic will be NATed from wwan to lan<br />If it is attached to lan then PC will be on the same subnet, which will be the same as your configuration above</p><p>This is what I&#039;m trying to do<br />[ISPModem]--cable--[WDS AP] - - - wireless - - - [WDS Client] - - - wireless - - - [PC]<br />If [PC] physically moves near [WDS AP] then it would connect to [WDS AP]</p><p>Am I missunderstanding WDS ? I&#039;ve also tried using routers of the same brand and type, still getting the same result. <br />If this isn&#039;t how WDS work, is it possible to use OpenWrt as a repeater ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, I think I understand what you want to achieve.. You just need to add a new virtual AP on your [WDS Client] which is bridged to the same network as the [WDS Client]. This will give you the new access point which behaves as a &#039;repeater&#039;, it&#039;s documented here:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds</a><br />in the part &#039;Old Stuff&#039; right at the bottom where it says to add a new VAP.</p>									</div>
