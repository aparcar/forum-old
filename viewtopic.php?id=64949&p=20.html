I use the same domain name for my local network hosts as my DDNS address. Dnsmasq is likely blocking attempts to resolve the external host because it has the same domain. To fix it, I added a cron script that grabs my public IP and pipes it in to a file /etc/vpnhost . Then, I added this extra host file to the list of other host files in the DHCP/DNS config. I also needed to use a non-default DNS server, and since I have Google Domains, I set it to 8.8.8.8 . </p><p>The script I used in case this helps anyone else:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/bash

myIP=$(ifconfig eth0 | grep &quot;inet addr&quot; | cut -d &#039;:&#039; -f 2 | cut -d &#039; &#039; -f 1)

myDomain=&quot; my.ddns.address&quot;

echo $myIP $myDomain &gt; //etc/vpnhost</code></pre></div>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>anymouse617</strong> on 11 Nov 2016, 20:46)</p>

That wifi driver that came with chaos Calmer never changes, unless you have someone compile the latest driver for kernel 3.18.23, and tells you how to install it.</p><p>Another option would be to download a daily snapshot, which will contain the latest wifi driver. However, it will not come with LuCi (Gui) as you have to install that through command line. Once LuCi is up, then you can install packages as you normally do. Keeping in mind, after a few days, new snapshots are uploaded (Always evolving), and you likely will not be able to install any more packages unless you use the force option which can be risky.&nbsp; &gt; Snapshot link <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/mvebu/generic/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots … u/generic/</a></p><p>The 3rd option would be to use someone&#039;s (3rd party) image. Usually, these are based on snapshots, but will likely come with Luci and other packages pre-compiled, so you don&#039;t have to install them yourself. 3rd party snapshots are also likely to contain the latest patches (if needed) as well as updated drivers.</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davidc502</strong> on 19 Nov 2016, 23:10)</p>
