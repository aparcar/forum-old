					<p>Newby.<br />I upgraded to openwrt hoping it had a web / gui like any normal firmware to my surpirse it had none weard and then finally figured out how to get into the ?? using telnet. (Though I destroyed the thing)<br />I created the password root and then browsed around a bit + exit.</p><p>Problem = telnet 192.168.1.1 and all it says = error , does not ask for passwd or anything just fails to connect I presume because of passwd being there. internet gets passed via the router but no wifi ??</p><p>I tried the brick reset method from hyperwrt and does nothing to bypass the password + did not install any of the ??? packages ???.</p><p>tftp does not connect = passwd in there / blocking and can not bypass.</p><p>Does anyone have a chainsaw or a fix for this piece of junk with no login ?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>If wireless doesn&#039;t connect anymore/yet, just connect it by cable to your box, and try to telnet/ssh in. From the minute you change the root password OpenWRT will disable telnet.</p><p>I hope you did not fiddle with the SSH password authentication settings (dropbear config)?</p>									</div>

					<p>Just openwrt telnet shows up first time then the how-to say&#039;s change paswwd to something and so I did. then messed around without edxiting any files as there is no nano and I have no clue as to or how vi / less works and could not download a rtx/bin image directly from inside it to reflash to a working firmware. downloaded to 90% then locks up / full ??</p><p>I finally managed after 15 tries to get into safe mode and use firstboot command to clear it.<br />Restarted it and could do normal telnet 192.168.1.1 and worked fine.</p><p>tftp / atftp could under no curcimstances flash this thing except for at the end the linksys tftp windows copy that temporarily brought it back to life.</p><p>Then tried to get rid of openwrt as I have no cooking clue as to how and what to install and did not find a general type info page for pakages to install so I am too stupid for this. gentoo sure no problem but not this.</p><p>Current problem = using the linksys tftp and factory default / current linksys4.47.1 I think is the one for mine to flash it = worked but after success + reboot the power button flashes once a second about and lan port 1to4 is on where cable is in.</p><p>I presume this thing is dying and will try the jtag if there is a proper guide for this if all else fails = paper weight / brick or something for the dog to chew on LOL</p><p>Usb to serial cable hope it works yeay.</p><p>Thanks for the help / info.</p>									</div>
