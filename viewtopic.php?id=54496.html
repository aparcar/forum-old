					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m totally new here.</p><p>I have the mentioned routers/modems and I would like to use one of them as a WiFi bridge (to extend the WiFi range of the base unit to another house).</p><p>I really like Netgear stuff and these have USB ports as well, so I can share an HDD&#039;s content as a NAS.</p><p>I tried the basic things.<br />Set repeating as base station on one unit, and repeating function on another, disable DHCP on the second one and so on (mac adresses, channel and SSID match, different IP for both etc,)</p><p>I can not make it work.<br />Asked Netgear&#039;s support, and they told me these models can NOT be used as WiFi bridge, since they have the modem inside, and that one can not be disabled.</p><p>Is there any possibility to use only these units (wih OpenWRT or without)</p><p>Please help me someway, I have no money to buy new things</p><p>THX in advance.</p><p>Regards</p>									</div>
