					<p>Hello, I&#039;m new to OpenWrt and am having some issues with my installation. I can&#039;t seem to ping from the router. More specifically, it seems as though I can ping <em>some</em> sites, but not others.</p><p>Router: Asus RT-N16 (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/asus/rt-n16">Wiki</a>)<br />Firmware: Barrier Breaker 14.07 (r42625)</p><p>My network looks like this: <a href="http://imgur.com/SChLr0z"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/SChLr0z.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/SChLr0z.jpg" /></span></a><br />Router 1 provides DHCP and wireless. Router 2 gives me more ports in my room and will run a small torrent/server on an external hard drive. </p><p>On Router 2, I installed the firmware, did first login, and then followed the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap">Dumb AP recipe</a>. Left the wifi off (the default) since I don&#039;t need it and disabled DHCP. I wanted to convert the WAN port into a LAN port, and so I followed the procedure. My /etc/config/network file now looks like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config switch &#039;eth0&#039;
        option name &#039;eth0&#039;
        option reset &#039;1&#039;
        option enable_vlan &#039;1&#039;

config switch_vlan
        option device &#039;eth0&#039;
        option vlan &#039;1&#039;
        option ports &#039;0 1 2 3 4 8t&#039;

config interface &#039;loopback&#039;
        option ifname &#039;lo&#039;
        option proto &#039;static&#039;
        option ipaddr &#039;127.0.0.1&#039;
        option netmask &#039;255.0.0.0&#039;

config globals &#039;globals&#039;
        option ula_prefix &#039;fd6d:56b5:886a::/48&#039;

config interface &#039;lan&#039;
        option ifname &#039;eth0.1 eth1&#039;
        option force_link &#039;1&#039;
        option type &#039;bridge&#039;
        option proto &#039;static&#039;
        option ipaddr &#039;192.168.1.2&#039;
        option gateway &#039;192.168.1.1&#039;
        option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;
        option dns &#039;192.168.1.1&#039;
        option ip6assign &#039;60&#039;</code></pre></div><p>This is great, the WAN port is now a LAN port, all the computers can get internet and are all on the same network.</p><p>The problem is pinging <em>from the router</em>. I&#039;m thinking this might be a problem if I install software that requires the internet.

I can access them just fine on any computer connected to Router 2.</p><p>Would anybody be able to shed some light on this? Are there settings that I should be changing? Aside from changing the name and setting up the Dumb AP, nothing else has been touched. I&#039;m still learning all about OpenWrt, so any help would be appreciated.</p><p>Thank you</p>									</div>
