					<p>I am new in OpenWrt, and need some help to figure out what I did wrong.<br/>I have flashed the OpenWrt Sw once, went back to original FW from netgear and worked as well. then decided to reflash Openwrt Fw:openwrt-DGND3700v1-squashfs-factory.chk<br/>even this worked fine.

Is there a way I can reconfigure the GUI or the interface to make it work?<br/>reset button does not work either.<br/>I tried to flash the Fw using the serial port. <br/>CFE&gt; f 192.168.1.10:filename.bin&nbsp; &nbsp;(tried even including the path with / or \ not working)<br/>all I get is an error -21 (file not found?)<br/>tried from windows command prompt to copy the image to flash using tftp<br/>time out error...connect request failed<br/>I was thinking to erase the flash memory using the CFE&gt; switch e...but not sure if this will definitely kill my router.<br/>I run out of option...any help is much appreciated.</p><p>Thanks<br/>Mastro1959</p><p>I must have messed up the configuration playing with the configuration...should not happen, but can be considering it is a</p>									</div>

					<p>The wiki about flashing/recovering this router is quite clear and and almost fully documented (except JTAG usage).</p><p>- The reset button should work.<br/></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Openwrt failsafe: Turn on the router, press/release the button Restore Factory Settings, at the bottom of the router, several times until the green power led starts blinking very fast, then you can access via telnet to OpenWrt.</p></blockquote></div><p>This should be enough to enter failsafe mode. then just erase the configuration partiton<br/></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mtd erase -r rootfs_data</code></pre></div><p>If the button doesnt work you can use the serial console to stop OpenWrt before loading the entire system with faulty settings.</p><p>- Flashing a new firmware should&#039;t be problem. Maybe easier to flash a .chk firmware since you won&#039;t need a TFTP server.</p><p>- Never erase the flash using CFE, it can destroy data specific for your board, even the CFE bootloader and end with a total brick.</p><p>Regards.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks danitool for the quick answer. I will&nbsp; try your suggestion as soon as I back form a business trip</p><p>what do you mean with flashing a new FW? using LUCI web server? I tried flashing the fw from CFE but all I get is this error -21 <br/>you are right the wiki page is well done and clear, still hard to figure out what I doing wrong.<br/>I am using putty as terminal console for the serial interface, and I do not know where the file I want to flash is supposed to be located, in the same directory I have lunched&nbsp; putty&nbsp; iguess, still not working I may have to try a different terminal console.</p><p>Best regards</p>									</div>
