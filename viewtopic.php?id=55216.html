					<p>Hi i am trying to use dnscrypt proxy. I have it installed and set up but cant get it to work with dnsmasq. In the wikie for dnscrypt it says you have to change the file at /etc/config/dhcp.

DNSCrypt requires precise time, otherwise it will not resolve any domain, including pool.ntp.org. So if your device&#039;s time was incorrect, it could never update its time, and therefore DNSCrypt would never work. So we set this exception so that pool.ntp.org queries will always bypass DNSCrypt and resolve with the standard unencrypted OpenDNS method.<br />Reboot router or restart dnsmasq for the changes to take effect. &quot;<br />End snip!</p><p>Now i have tryed copying and pasting that dhcp text in to /etc/config/dhcp but it stops my router from resolving dns.</p><p>Here is my what i have at /etc/config/dhcp to start with:<br />snip!</p><p>config dnsmasq<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option domainneeded &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option boguspriv &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option filterwin2k &#039;0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option localise_queries &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option rebind_protection &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option rebind_localhost &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option local &#039;/lan/&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option domain &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option expandhosts &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option nonegcache &#039;0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option authoritative &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option readethers &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option leasefile &#039;/tmp/dhcp.leases&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option resolvfile &#039;/tmp/resolv.conf.auto&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; list addnhosts &#039;/etc/block.hosts&#039;</p><p>config dhcp &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option interface &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option start &#039;100&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option limit &#039;150&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option leasetime &#039;6h&#039;</p><p>config dhcp &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option interface &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ignore &#039;1&#039;</p><p> End snip!<br /> I think it mite have some thing too do with NTP server the one i am using is 0.europe.pool.ntp.org wich is at 46.4.24.238 I think.</p><p>Can some one help me to get my /etc/config/dhcp correct please?</p>									</div>

					<p>I just finished getting this working on my setup and noticed that I had to manually start the dnscrypt service every time and it did not survive a router reboot even with it being enabled in /etc/rc.d directory(supposedly after config file changes /etc/init.d/dnscrypt-proxy enable should make it work on reboot...which it doesn&#039;t appear too on mine)&nbsp; It seems like dnscrypt daemon does not stick when executed before the network interfaces(?) or perhaps dnsmasq comes online.&nbsp; Either way it doesn&#039;t stick when done through the standard process.&nbsp; I tried it in rc.local and was still too soon.&nbsp; I eventually installed the at package and what I put in my /etc/rc.local file.</p><p># Put your custom commands here that should be executed once<br /># the system init finished. By default this file does nothing.<br />echo &quot;/etc/init.d/dnscrypt-proxy start&quot; | at now + 1 minutes<br />exit 0</p><p>this seemed to do the trick...although I actually just logged onto the forum to ask if there was a more elegant and reliable way to get it up and running...such as chaining onto the end of interfaces coming up...not sure exactly why it won&#039;t start earlier than certain network interface daemons coming up but seems to be the case...something where you don&#039;t have to wait a minute <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> or have it fail if network takes longer to come up</p><p>so if you want to get it going how I did you should <br />opkg update<br />opkg install at</p><p>then change your dhcp to the recommended</p><p>then modify rc.local as above</p><p>then reboot</p><p>also will see dnscrypt-proxy running in ps output if it&#039;s going</p><p>hope this helps and hopefully someone has a better solution but for now this works for me...I&#039;m guessing that&#039;s what&#039;s happening in your situation as well.</p>									</div>
