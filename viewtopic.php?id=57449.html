					<p>Your router will not have an IP address unless it is connected (via a lan port) to a DHCP server.&nbsp; The easiest way would be to temporarily set up another router and use it as a DHCP server.&nbsp; Log into that router to see what address your 1200 obtained.</p><p>Or look up failsafe mode for your model.&nbsp; If you can boot into failsafe mode you can telnet to 192.168.1.1 and then either edit the config files or run firstboot to reset everything to defaults.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 20 May 2015, 16:35)</p>

					<p>Connect the LAN of the other router to one of the LAN ports on the OpenWRT router, not the WAN port.&nbsp; This is if you really have set its LAN by mistake as a DHCP client.&nbsp; The WAN defaults to being a DHCP client, but access to the admin page from the WAN side is by default blocked.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 21 May 2015, 05:06)</p>

					<p>You may just have set the LAN interface to a different IP, or otherwise disabled it. Your best bet is to get OpenWRT into failsafe mode so that it resets its configuration back to 192.168.1.1. Use this procedure:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe</a></p><p>If there&#039;s no way to do that, you&#039;ll have to resort to getting to the console with a USB to TTL cable (involves opening the box and voiding the warranty) as described here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1200ac">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1200ac</a> and then re-flashing OpenWRT or the original firmware to reset the beast.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Steltek</strong> on 22 May 2015, 11:10)</p>

					<p>That is related to Linksys wrt1900ac, right?</p><p>You might also try the same procedure to switch to the secondary firmware.<br />I am not sure if there is such one in 1200, but there might be.<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1900ac#in_case_something_goes_wrong_with_your_firmware_flash">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt â€¦ ware_flash</a></p><p>You might need to google for router-specific recovery processes.</p><p>If there is still Openwrt running, the failsafe mode is a good option, but it has just a 2 second window, during which you need to push a button (at the right stage of the boot process, varies from router to router.)</p>									</div>

					<p>No its related to the Linksys wrt1200ac</p><p>I haven&#039;t come across anything regarding router specifics on entering fail safe mode or an alternative firmware.&nbsp; this has been one of the most frustrating challenged ive come across haha.</p><p>I have ordered a USB to TTL cable which should be a new adventure in its own,&nbsp; I guess this router is just to new for troubleshooting information for noobs like myself.</p>									</div>
