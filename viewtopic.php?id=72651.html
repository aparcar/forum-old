					<p>In attempting to install OpenWrt on a Belkin F5D8235-4_v1, I found that it failed to flash through the web interface. <br />I also failed to install via TFTP from U-Boot. It never requests the file and times out.<br />I recompiled busybox to include tftp command and can successfully retrieve the file from the router when it is booted up normally. Next, I thought I&#039;d try using Kermit to flash OpenWrt from U-Boot but that functionality was not included in the installed U-Boot version so I recompiled U-Boot and am unable to flash from linux on router presumably because the U-Boot partition is read only.</p><p>So, I seem to be pretty well stuck with this and could use some help.</p>									</div>
