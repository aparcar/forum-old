					<p>Hi,</p><p>I bought a Linksys WRT54GL v1.1 (sn: CL7B) last saturday. </p><p>I flashed it with OpenWrt Backfire 10.03. In first case, i defined boot_wait and boot_time in nvram to prevent a brick with a bad upgrade.</p><p>Since i flashed my router with several of my own compilations of OpenWrt to install openvpn and screen packages. Sometimes, router didn&#039;t boot. In this case, i flashed the router by failsafe mode by uploading a proper image with tftp command.</p><p>The problem is that when i flashed last time, the router didn&#039;t boot again and the tftp command fails each time (the router never comes up with ip address 192.168.1.1). The power led blinks constantly.</p><p>In your opinion, is my router bricked ? Is there a solution to re-flash my router with a proper image ?</p><p>Thanks in advance...</p>									</div>

					<p>If it&#039;s bricked anyway and you don&#039;t want to/can&#039;t jtag it, you could always try the pin shorting approach. It&#039;s&nbsp; dangerous, but if you&#039;re going to toss it what do you have to loose <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
