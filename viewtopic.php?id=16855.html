					<p>Hi guys, i really need some advice on what to do with my dead wrt54gl, so here goes.<br />I installed an SD card reader into my router then decided to follow this guide... <a href="http://www.hendlsofen.de/WRT54GL/eng/WRT54GL_SDMod.html">http://www.hendlsofen.de/WRT54GL/eng/WRT54GL_SDMod.html</a> ... to get it up and running. When i came to the page that shows how to automatically mount the SD card to / on boot and followed the instructions to the letter, upon reboot i had somehow managed to brick the router.<br />Now, i followed a tutorial telling me to short pins 16 and 17 to get it into failsafe mode, which i did and recovered it with the stock Linksys firmware, THEN (stupidly) decided to give the same tutorial a second chance, that maybe i had done something wrong? So at the same point in the guide, i rebooted and guess what? it bricked again! Wonderful i thought, so i proceeded with the same unbricking proceedure but this time instead of going into failsafe mode it would connect for a second then the network would become unavailable. I am using Ubuntu and had 2 terminals open. 1 for pinging to check when it was ready for tftp, and the 2nd for the tftp side.<br />Then after a little checking around i found this... <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Installing/TFTP?action=show&amp;redirect=OpenWrtViaTftp">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Ins â€¦ WrtViaTftp</a> ... With specific focus on this command &quot; atftp --trace --option &quot;timeout 1&quot; --option &quot;mode octet&quot; --put --local-file openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin 192.168.1.1 &quot; which i tried. Everything seemed to go smoothly, it connected and uploaded the file successfully, and after a long time of waiting, the router didn&#039;t seem to do anything. I eventually pulled the power cord out and rebooted it. <br />Now instead of getting the flashing power light and the DMZ light going on and off every few seconds and my port 1 light being on, now i have a flashing power light and all 4 ports and the internet light are lit up solid and the router won&#039;t respond to anything that i have tried. I manually set my lan card&#039;s ip address to 192.168.1.2 and tried to ping it, no luck. I tried shorting 16 and 17, no luck.</p><p>At this point guys, i am out of ideas. Can anybody please help me fix this router for once and for all.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Predtech</p>									</div>

					<p>That sounds like your router is hosed.&nbsp; If you look at the PCB do you see any obvious char marks?&nbsp; You might be able to try JTAG, but honestly I am not optimistic.&nbsp; It is better to use boot wait wherever possible, and tftp rather than pin shorting, or serial.</p>									</div>
