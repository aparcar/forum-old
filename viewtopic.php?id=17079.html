					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;m wondering if anyone has tried this setup using openwrt.&nbsp; Using 1 antenna as monitoring mode for aircrack usage and 2nd antenna to keep open wireless communication to the device if needed.</p><p>Here is the combination i&#039;m thinking of using.&nbsp; <br />WRT54G with aircrack running.<br />Dumping the .cap file to my Nokia N95 for storage using cifs.<br />Using my Nokia N810 to ssh into WRT54G while aircrack is running.</p><p>Is it possible?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>syuusuke</strong> on 23 Sep 2008, 20:18)</p>

					<p>unrestricted and continuous receiving for monitoring purpose while at the same time transmitting and receiving to allow communication with the router requires two radio circuits; a wrt54g only has one. The dual antennas have nothing to do with this and just allow the choice of which one works best; the short wavelength of the radio signals at 2.4 GHz and reflections cause in space a pattern of null signal strength and max signal strength and the distance between the antennas is chosen such that if one antenna would happen to be in a null spot it is likely the other sees some signal.</p><p>Even with two radios there is the issue that the transmissions of one are likely to overload the other (simple) receiver, turning it insensitive.</p>									</div>

					<p>It is very common to think 2 antenna means 2 radios that could be split somehow.</p><p>This is not the case.&nbsp; There is a single half-duplex radio and a diversity switch.&nbsp; Whichever antenna gets best reception in auto mode is also used for transmit.&nbsp; This helps in interior usage where a metal pipe between your client and antenna B might be blocking signal.</p>									</div>
