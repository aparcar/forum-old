					<p>Hotplugging the printer HP Laserjet 1018 does not work properly for me.&nbsp; The details are described below and my rant above.</p><p>[RANT]<br />I followed the instructions for this in Point 2.0.3 on this page:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/KamikazeConfiguration">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Kam â€¦ figuration</a><br />And I even figured out that 7.0.9 creates the device as /dev/lp0 and not /dev/usb/lp0 as the docs refer to.<br />Better still I found the missing &quot;fi&quot; in the Docs and managed to get the sihp1018.dl file by compiling some sources.[/RANT]</p><br /><p>When I boot the router(Netgear WGT634U), the script(below) creates the /dev/lp0 as a FILE:<br />root@OpenWrt:/dev# ls -la lp0<br /><strong>-rw-r--r--</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1 root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;129143 Jan&nbsp; 1 00:03 lp0</p><p>However, if I delete this file and then replug the printer then everything works just fine:<br />root@OpenWrt:/dev# ls -la lp0<br /><strong>crw-r--r--</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1 root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;180,&nbsp; &nbsp;0 Jan&nbsp; 1 00:05 lp0</p><p>My question: How can I fix the script to make it wait for the device /dev/lp0 to appear(exist) before it tries to send the firmware to it?&nbsp; When I find/someone give me the solution, then I will of course fix the errors in the wiki.&nbsp; I have made substantial efforts and of course searched the forum.&nbsp; I am 95% of the way to my goal.&nbsp; A little hand holding for the next 5% would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks, deChrLam</p><p>This is the script: /etc/hotplug.d/usb/hplj1018<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

					<p>Bump again.&nbsp; Some kind of reply, even a fsck you! would be nice.</p><p>This bloody thing sends the firmware to the printer with this: cat $FIRMWARE &gt; /dev/lp0, but if it is always too quick and it sends before the printer appears as a device then it just ends up creating a file, blocking the printer from appearing.</p>									</div>

					<p>I can&#039;t give you an exact answer right now but maybe the following will help anyway. You can test for whether or not the file exists with something like &quot;while ! [ -f /dev/lp0 ]; do sleep 1; done&quot;. Might need something other than -f. Try running &quot;help test&quot; at a bash command prompt or maybe &quot;man test&quot;. &quot;[&quot; is basically an alias for test, so you could say &quot;while ! test -f ...&quot; (which is why you can look at the docs for the test command, but people usually use [ in scripts. The while loop will never terminate if the device file does not appear.</p>									</div>

					<p>Waiting for the file may not help, as it seems it initially does exist, but is not a device descriptor file. Namely in :</p><p>root@OpenWrt:/dev# ls -la lp0<br />-rw-r--r--&nbsp; &nbsp; 1 root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;129143 Jan&nbsp; 1 00:03 lp0</p><p>/dev/lp0 does exist, but the permissions do not begin with a &quot;c&quot; that would be symptomatic of a &quot;character&quot; device ; at this point, it does not have either major/minor device number, but a file size instead...</p><p>Well, it does exist, but it is a common file, and not a device node yet...</p><p>I do not know why a common file is created instead of a device node, but testing the first letter issued by this command would seem more appropriate to me : deChrLam says that if he deletes this file, this behaves better - if you did not need to replug the printer after deleting this one, you could test for the &quot;character device&quot; nature of this emplacement, and delete it if it was a simple file, in your hotplug script.</p><p>&quot;/dev/lp0&quot; is anyway supposed to exist even before any firmware is loaded into it... but this should be a device node, and not a file.</p><p>By the way, &quot;3f0/4117/100&quot; seems good, to identify this printer (I have one at home, but do not have USB ports on my WRT54GS, and plug it into a Debian Lenny, instead, which loads the firmware through a &quot;RUN+&quot; stanza in the udev rule of concern).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Aefron</strong> on 25 Oct 2008, 13:20)</p>

					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>Thanks for your suggestions.&nbsp; Sorry I did not reply sooner, but I was busy installing the finished X-WRT on my 2 Netgear WGT634U boxes. </p><p>My final solution is not pretty but it works OK.&nbsp; The only thing is: I have to power cycle or replug the printer for it to work.&nbsp; That is still better than logging in and deleting a file and replugging or power cycling the printer.&nbsp; I test for the presence of lp0 as a file(through filesize in first post) and then delete it.</p><p><strong>/etc/hotplug.d/usb/hplj1018:</strong><br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
