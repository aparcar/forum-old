					<p>If you don&#039;t want to use a VM and are tired of Cygwin error messages &amp; problems, Andlinux (http://www.andlinux.org/) is another option which works as a very nice WinXP-friendly OpenWRT build environment with near-native-linux performance (at lest when I tried it over a year ago with the Andlinux pre-beta).&nbsp; When you install it, just be sure to make a big enough &#039;base.drv&#039; virtual drive (found in the Andlinux &#039;Drive&#039; directory) to accommodate the entire OS and OpenWRT build-environment, create a non-root user, and to &#039;sudo apt-get install&#039; all the standard &#039;build-essentialâ€™ and related build-environment utilities that you&#039;d need if you were running in a native Linux environment.&nbsp; If you run out of room in your base.drv virtual drive, you&#039;ll know because you start seeing a bunch of strange error messages (which weren&#039;t there a minute ago) when you run &#039;make.&#039;&nbsp; Andlinux has a utility to resize the virtual drive to create more space.</p>									</div>

As distro I used a current debian, without any gui (booted from the netboot image and installed only a minimal system, adding only the packages needed for compiling openwrt).

					<p>i agree that Virtualization should not be that hard.&nbsp; the cost of hardware is so cheap these days.&nbsp; I actually can run VirtualBox on an Intel Atom CPU fine (eee 1000H machine).</p><p>Alternatively, keep working on figuring out why the makefiles fail on cygwin and submit a patch.&nbsp; Might take a lot of learning... but honestly I don&#039;t see it as something with high demand - and you can&#039;t expect all developers here to have Windows around.&nbsp; If nobody else is working on that bug - take ownership of it!</p><p>I use Cygwin for like 8 years now, it is OK - but I think doing cross compile and building a linux kernel from it is going to have unique issues from time to time.&nbsp; Even on native Linux there can be problems with specific gcc releases.</p><p>How up to date is your cygwin?&nbsp; Uninstall it completely and re-install it.</p><p>Searching internet reveals a couple other projects that have this message and cygwin:&nbsp; scilab.org, soothsayer, Mixmaster.&nbsp; Maybe try compiling them just to see if they give a better hint on what is missing?</p><p>If the build says it can&#039;t find ncurses, look around for solutions.&nbsp; See: <a href="http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/linux-programming-scripting/83435-curses-dev-kit-cygwin.html">http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/linux- … ygwin.html</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>RoundSparrow</strong> on 24 Jan 2009, 16:21)</p>
