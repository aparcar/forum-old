					<p>fred3398, to be clear... it is not safe.</p><p>I don&#039;t think anyone has successfully ever flashed (OpenWRT to) the router from the web interface. If they had, I think they would have posted so in the topic I linked to. Or they would comment here.</p><p>The router was added months ago to the &quot;unknown&quot; list of hardware:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/unknown">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/unknown</a><br />No one has moved it from unknown to &quot;possible&quot;, &quot;work in progress&quot; or &quot;supported&quot;.</p><p>That said... there is an image for it... I don&#039;t know for sure that it will fail. I just say I don&#039;t think it is safe.</p><p>Worst scenarios if you try to flash it:<br />1) You brick the router beyond repair.<br />2) You brick the router and needs a serial console to recover factory firmware<br />3) OpenWRT does not start, but the router can be restored using some recovery mode</p>									</div>

					<p>Archer C20i: I successfully flashed the CC RC1 sysupgrade image using stock firmware:<br /><a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05-rc1/ramips/mt7620/openwrt-15.05-rc1-ramips-mt7620-ArcherC20i-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal â€¦ pgrade.bin</a><br />I dont know if this was by design, or pure luck. Or if it was stupid for some reason. And I dont know how to go back to OEM (and I dont intend to).</p><p>I put some basic information on the device page:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/archer-c20i">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/archer-c20i</a></p><p>I moved it from &quot;Unknown&quot; to &quot;Supported&quot; in ToH.</p><p>It seems, at first glance, that 2.4GHz works and 5GHz does not work. As expected. Although, I have not tested, just seen that OpenWrt discovers it.</p><p>I have CC RC1 on this device now. It has been stable for 51 minutes now (doing no real work).<br />If you have any questions about it, I will try to provide answers.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey,</p><p>so I bricked mine today too. Can anyone of you provide me the correct PINs for the UART connection?</p><p>What I tried: Actually, I bricked 2 C20i (which is even worse). The first one I tried to upload the image via TFTP (Recovery mode) which worked pretty fine. Only afterward, the router is not doing anything.

I am also under the impression that I successfully uploaded an image via TFTP, but now it is dead (I think I have exactly the same light/cable-situation as you have).</p><p>I broke in to mine yesterday, to access the serial connections. It was not a pretty job. If anyone wants to get in I can provide pictures. There are two screws under the sticker at the bottom of the router - I guess it is best to remove those first <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>There are four connections inside that are supposed to be serial:<br />Square-round-round-round.<br />They are supposed to be<br />VCC-Ground-TX/RX (dont know the order of TX/RX).</p><p>I tried to connect it to a raspberry pi (which also uses 3.3V serial). I was not successful. I tried both 9600 and 115200. I am not very good at serial connections, but the few times I have tried I usually get what I want in the end. Not with my C20i. I might try with a USB-Serial-adapter some day.</p><p>If I learn anything I will definitely post it here. I appreciate any help to recover my C20i.</p>									</div>
