					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I am building a project that will result in (hopefully) hundreds of prebuild raspberry pi&#039;s (running openwrt) in local schools in an effort to protect children from various dangers on the web.</p><p>However, since there are often power cuts in my country, I am loosing hair thinking about having tons of SD cards failing and having to drive out to replace them. As a result, I have researched ways to prevent corruption on the SD card (major problem with the default OS on RPi&#039;s) and I came across the concept of building a full read-only file system and then symlinking things like logs, etc. to /tmp (or something to that effect, maybe even to an attached USB disk).</p><p>Here is an example (even though I would rather use Openwrt) - <a href="http://archive.nutcom.hu/ipe/">http://archive.nutcom.hu/ipe/</a></p><p>My two questions</p><p>1) Is Openwrt as suseptable to SD card corruption on the Raspberry pi 2 as the default OS? From what I have learnt, it is not as it keeps the kernel, etc. (on the first partition) and that is readonly.</p><p>2) Is it possible to convert additional areas (for use of a better word) to read only to minimize the risk mentioned above?</p><p>Thanks everyone <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>want your device to be used as a black box in absolutely ANY environment; with parents having the ability to easily take the PI off a wall socket without ever worrying about corrupting the sdcard; you should definitely go with an industrial perennial image like IPER1/R2.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mulletman87</strong> on 15 Feb 2016, 08:55)</p>

					<p>If anyone has any info on this, I would really appreciate it. From what I can tell, because the RPi only has an SD card, it is not really benefiting from the read only root (which would usually be on the NAND on a router) and still have issues with corrupting the SD when powered off a number of times without a clean shutdown.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

So with squashfs and the overlay, the rest of the space (with the exception of the OS itself) can be used normally (i.e. it is writable, can install packages to it, etc.) ?</p><p>Additionally, since it is read only, there will be zero writes that is what prevents the sdcard corruption?</p>									</div>
