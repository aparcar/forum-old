					<p>Hi All,</p><p>With a WRT54GS, V1.1 and BackFire (10.03-beta, r19944) loaded, how do you configure the unit so that a PC can be plugged into the LAN port ?</p><p>Several hours have been spent trying to get this working. It has been configured as an AP OK, so there is a pretty good chance that the wireless sub-system is OK.</p><p>A WEP 64 key is also required - is this ASCII (apparently 5 characters), hex, or other format ?</p><p>Having stared that the openWRT config screens for some time, it is very clear that I haven&#039;t a clue about bridging. Are there any newbie descriptions specific to openWRT available ?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Mark</p><p>NB The associated AP is a DI-614+ that has a DHCP server running, wireless laptops can already attach OK.</p>									</div>

					<p>I do this routinely, and since I just upgraded to BackFire 10.03-rc1, I can describe the procedure.</p><p>1.&nbsp; Configure your network IP and gateway (static) in <strong>/etc/config/network</strong>.&nbsp; I am using an example where your home network range is <strong>192.168.1.0/24</strong>, and you&#039;ve chosen an IP ending in .254 for your OpenWRT bridge, and your router is at .1:</p><p><strong>/etc/config/network</strong><br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface lan
        option type     bridge
        option ifname   &quot;eth0.0&quot;
        option proto    static
        option ipaddr   192.168.1.254
        option netmask  255.255.255.0
        option gateway  192.168.1.1</code></pre></div><p>2.&nbsp; Presumably your OpenWRT bridge does <em>not</em> need to provide DHCP or DNS services, because your AP or other gateway already provides those services.&nbsp; You should therefore disable OpenWRT&#039;s <strong>dnsmasq</strong> service in order to not conflict with those services:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># rm /etc/rc.d/S60dnsmasq</code></pre></div><p>This will prevent <strong>dnsmasq</strong> from starting at next boot.</p><p>3.&nbsp; If you want DNS to work on your OpenWRT bridge, you should configure DNS to point statically to your nameservers.&nbsp; I assume your gateway provides this function:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># rm /etc/resolv.conf
# echo &#039;nameserver 192.168.1.1&#039; &gt; /etc/resolv.conf</code></pre></div><p>4.&nbsp; OpenWRT wireless configuration is fairly well documented.&nbsp; The settings I use here are for my WRT54GL, but your settings may always differ slightly from these, so don&#039;t blindly paste these settings in without understanding them:</p><p><strong>/etc/config/wireless</strong><br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-device  wl0
        option type     broadcom
        option channel  5

config wifi-iface
        option device   wl0
        option network  lan
        option mode     sta
        option ssid     YOUR_SSID
        option encryption wep
        option key      XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</code></pre></div><p>The important items are &quot;option mode&quot; set to &quot;sta&quot; (for STAtion mode), &quot;options ssid&quot; set to the SSID you&#039;re associating with, &quot;option encryption&quot; set to &quot;wep&quot;, and &quot;option key&quot; set to the 26-digit hex key that you&#039;re using (for 128-bit encryption) or the 10-digit hex key you&#039;re using (for 64-bit encryption).</p><p>After a reboot you should find that your device associates with your AP.&nbsp; Note that, if it doesn&#039;t, you no longer have a source of DHCP for your computer, so you will not get an IP when you plug in.&nbsp; In that case, you must statically assign your computer an IP in order to be able to connect to 192.168.1.254 in order to debug and troubleshoot the problem.</p><p>If the bridge is able to establish the connection to the AP, then your AP will be able to extend DHCP service to you, and everything will work like magic.</p><p>Hope this helps you.&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><br /><p>P.S.&nbsp; I have had NO LUCK getting WPA2 to work in this configuration.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping to solve that issue soon.</p>									</div>
