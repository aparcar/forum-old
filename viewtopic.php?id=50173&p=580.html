					<p>@sera,</p><p>Before raising my question I&#039;d like to thank you again for your great patches <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />I built my Linux 4.9 based image in January from openwrt trunk with your 2017-01-07 patches, and my Caimen has been running very stable since then. No wifi problem, no reboots. 60 days uptime before I had a power loss at home.</p><p>However I attached a 250GB SSD (mx200, if that matters) to the USB3.0 port last night and immediately observed several random reboots when Aria2 downloading torrents to the SSD. I know this could be any party&#039;s fault, be it the hard drive enclosure, Caimen HW or the Linux kernel / driver. Are you by any chance aware of any similar issues? The only related reboot report I can find is @doITright mentioning torrents caused reboots right in this thread, and he seemed to have the same issue with 4.11 and your latest patch set.</p><p>Thanks a again for you time <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

This indeed never occur to me. I checked in &quot;top&quot; and 400MB RAM immediately got allocated for cache after aria2c started downloading, leaving only a few MBs RAM free.

					<p>rlei,</p><p>The reboot issue is exclusive to Mamba. All others are almost the same hardware. Mamba is based on a different and older SoC.</p><p>There might be an issue with extfat but more likely as JW0914 stated it&#039;s an issue with running out of memory. Usually this isn&#039;t an issue as the oom-killer will kick in at some point. Swap will only help to make that happen later. The issue is likely an atomic memory allocation which must succeed immediately and so doesn&#039;t allow for swap or oom-killer to free up any memory at all which then would result in a crash.</p><p>The default for free memory to keep around for such is a little on the low side in OpenWrt so I suggest to set<br />&quot;sysctl -w vm.min_free_kbytes=16384&quot; to avoid such issues. Also add it to /etc/sysctl.d/local.conf to preserve the setting over reboots.</p>									</div>

					<p>BTW I just realized that by default the aria2 daemon&#039;s log level is &quot;debug&quot;. It would fill up the whole tmpfs (250MB of RAM) in just seconds. However, fixing the log level alone won&#039;t stop OS cache from consuming most available RAM eventually. So the vm.min_free_kbytes setting is still needed.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rlei</strong> on 25 May 2017, 17:52)</p>

Did you ever connect the usb2tll cable before and had proper console output? Ie. you actually know how to do it and confirmed it was working?</p>									</div>

					<p>swrt-2017-05-29<br />---------------</p><p>4.10 became EOL as anticipated, change default kernel to 4.11. Also drop unused<br />kmod-ledtrig-usbdev and kmod-gpio-button-hotplug from default packages for<br />mvebu. Degarde 4.10 support to a minimum as done with other old kernels.</p><p>About the Rango series, an upstream developer commented on the CPU frequency<br />patch to also check the ddr and l2 clocks for sane values. Indeed those need<br />adjusting as well. Update the clocking patch accordingly. Then all but the<br />clocking patch got applied already and will be in 4.13. The clocking patch will<br />need to enter through a different tree.</p><p>Then backport the Rango series to 4.11, so both 4.11 and 4.12 in swrt use the<br />new dts for all models. This bloats 4.11 a bit but well.</p><p>There was also a bump of firmware and a bugfix for mwlwifi. One issue less for<br />Rango users.</p><p>Todays next needs two new patches, one for a missing config dependency the<br />other is a revert of a stricter type check which breaks building mwlwifi.</p><br /><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>* linux-4.4: bump to 4.4.70<br />* linux-4.9: bump to 4.9.30<br />* linux-4.11: bump to 4.11.3, make default<br />* linux-4.12: bump to 4.12-rc3<br />* linux-next: bump to next-20170515</p><p>* mwlwifi-firmware: bump (Rango)<br />* kmod-mwlwifi-nocompat: bump</p><p>* linux 4.10: degrade to minimal support / vanillify as far as possible<br />* linux 4.11: backport Rango series<br />* linux 4.12: update clocking patch<br />* linux next: drop 15 patches already upstream, revert stricter typecheck,<br />&nbsp; patch missing config dep.</p><p>swrt-2017-05-29.tar.xz: <a href="https://gpldr.in/v/6Wp7an5kWu/VU9D313KWc4iN6uh">https://gpldr.in/v/6Wp7an5kWu/VU9D313KWc4iN6uh</a><br />sha256sum: fab3853cd3db5a67faef7fdd8208b78601b065dafd783b02fde3d538600e013c</p></blockquote></div>									</div>
