					<p>Hello, </p><p>Someone gave me this Access point, that they connected to the wrong power supply. Now, the little regulator near the power connection is toasted, to the point I cannot read its markings. </p><p>Could anyone that has some AP of these, or some good definition image of its board, tell me what is the markings in it ?( or send the picture ) . It is a little chip with 4 legs in each side, between the coils in the power supply part of the router. ItÂ´s markings start with AP.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve got an 7207Apg... might be a similar design.</p><p>The only 8-Pin device near the power section is a PJ34063 made by PanJit</p><p>Searching this on google gives: <a href="http://www.digchip.com/datasheets/download_datasheet.php?id=769855&amp;part-number=PJ34063">http://www.digchip.com/datasheets/downl … er=PJ34063</a></p><p>But searching AP34063 gives: <a href="http://www.digchip.com/datasheets/download_datasheet.php?id=151252&amp;part-number=AP34063A">http://www.digchip.com/datasheets/downl … r=AP34063A</a></p><p>Which seems to be the almost same device, but made by Anachip Corp. instead.</p><p>Seems to me that highly likely your toasted part is an AP34063.</p><p>Hope this will help you somewhat...</p>									</div>
