					<p>Hi There,</p><p>My name is Simon Willis and I&#039;m currently attempting to port OpenWrt to the Moxa W321. This device comes with uClinux on a 2.6.38 kernel. I already have the original Moxa kernel tarball and have managed to build patches to get Attitude Adjustment on a 3.3.8 kernel to compile and to build an image. The Moxa is currently booting the image file, but stops at the &quot;Calibrating loop delay&quot; step. I&#039;m currently in the process of debugging this, but from what I can tell, the timer interrupts are not working (the jiffies are not changing). I&#039;ve taken the Moxa time.c file straight form the 2.6.38 kernel. Does anyone know if there are any differences to the 3.3.8 kernel that I need to be aware of? I&#039;m still digging further, but if anyone has any suggestions, they&#039;d be much appreciated. </p><p>Secondly, on booting, the memory reported is shown 16MB, whereas there is actually 32MB. Also, there doeasn&#039;t appear to be any DMA allocated (on the 2.6.38 kernel there was 2MB). If anyone can point in a direction to investigate, it would be much appreciated.</p><p>Please forgive me, I&#039;m relatively new to kernel hacking, so this is a steep learning curve.</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Simon</p>									</div>
