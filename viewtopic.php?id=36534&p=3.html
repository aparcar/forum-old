					<p>Some people have advised me not to go for the WR1043ND , but to wait for the WDR4300, if i wanna make a file server and torrent downloader. But ANother user said that his DLINK 815, which is faster, freezes while downloading torrents on OpenWRT, so does this mean the WDR4300 won&#039;t be enough either? .. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/neutral.png" width="15" height="15" alt="neutral" /> Am iI waiting in vain?</p>									</div>

					<p>Well the wr1043nd isn&#039;t really good for that. It can handle some torrent and samba, but don&#039;t expect too much. (just don&#039;t forget to give it swap-space or it will really freeze from running out of memory)<br />The wdr4300 can take much more punishment, but it&#039;s still a router. That said, if you don&#039;t have 50Mbps+ bandwith and don&#039;t want to run 20+ torrents, then it&#039;s quite capable. (again don&#039;t forget swap or you might get instant freeze)</p>									</div>

					<p>I currently own a 1043 with openwrt and a d-link 855 with its default firmware.

					<p>I also noticed that I have slower 2.4Ghz speeds with the WRD4300 + OpenWRT.<br />I can&#039;t make 5Ghz comparisons as my old router didn&#039;t have 5Ghz radio. But the current 5Ghz speed looks fine to me.</p><p>What is troubling that one of my laptops with an Atheros Lite-N 150Mbps WiFi card achieved ~11Mb/s data with old router (DIR-615 Rev B) but this speed decreased to ~8Mb/s with this new one (WRD4300 + OpenWRT).<br />I guess nobody would except this. The funny thing is that this router also uses Atheros chipset (just like my laptop WiFi card) unlike my old router.
