I will introduce it to my friends! As the Linux kernel in your build is 3.10.53, very update, May I ask if the ipk packages under download.openwrt.org/...../barrier_breaker/14.07-rc3/ar71xx/nand/packages/ works well with your build? </p><p>Thank you!</p>									</div>

I tried the patch you mentioned but it actually broke my working 3700v4 VLAN setup with both tagged/untagged ports...</p><p>To be more specific, I have 3 vlans like this:</p><p>vlan 1: &quot;0t 1 2 3t 4&quot;<br />vlan 2: &quot;0t 5t&quot;<br />vlan 3: &quot;3t 5t&quot;</p><p>so vlan 3 is for my IPTV which is connected to another router connected to 3700v4&#039;s port 3...</p><p>This setup works fine with AdamK/Diffie&#039;s builds as well as the official builds, with only one exception: all LAN ports will randomly stop receiving DHCP/ARP broadcasts every several days. That&#039;s why I tried the patch mentioned. And with the patch my 3700v4 just seems to be booting into the exact issue directly <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p>									</div>

That means:<br />1. get your computer ready by setting a static IP address to 192.168.1.2<br />2. start the TFTP client and point it to 192.168.1.1<br />3. in terminal window start the continues ping of 192.168.1.1<br />4. unplug the power cable, press and hold the reset button.<br />5. watch the LED for the switch (port 1 -4) once the all blink green and turn off, immediately after that you should see router responding to the pings in the terminal window and that&#039;s your trigger to start TFTP session sending the original firmware from netgear in to the router. Release the reset button. <br />6. Let it complete the transfer, this process takes between 5 - 20 minutes. <br />7. once transfer is done, DO NOT unplug the router and let it sit for another 10 min, after that it sould reboot on it&#039;s own and respond on 192.168.1.1</p><p>Good luck.&nbsp; </p><p>Please see my post here: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=249687#p249687">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 87#p249687</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>SoCal_sky</strong> on 9 Oct 2014, 09:22)</p>

					<p>you should only need the factory file for initial flash. Sysupgrade is used when upgrading. Not sure if there&#039;s something unique about this in relation to the NAND flash.</p>									</div>
