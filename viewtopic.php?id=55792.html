					<p>Bumped!! Mate I have the same issue. Actually i want to remove the IPv6 packages completely so that I can have more space on my small 4MB flash of WR841ND router. Some help would be highly appreciated in this regard as to how to disable and remove the IPv6 support and packages as its seems to be unnecessary at the moment</p>									</div>
