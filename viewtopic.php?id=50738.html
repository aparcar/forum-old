					<p>Hello,</p><p>Following my previous <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=233833">post</a>, I think it might be useful to have a gcc compiler in my router, so I could compile small programs right on it.</p><p>However, it seems gcc is only included in X86 OpenWRT images, so it has to be somehow cross compiled before for all other architectures (most routers).</p><p>I have tried to do so, but since my compilation knowledge is very limited, I&#039;m facing problems.<br />By default, gcc is not included, so I have edited the gcc makefile in order to depend on @MIPS, and have also changed the PKG_SOURCE_URL field. No luck.</p><p>Anyone kindly enough to point me in the right direction?</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br />Jabss</p>									</div>

					<p>What router do you have that you want to install GCC to compile your program? How big is your program?</p><p>Add the following line to your feeds.conf file and then do a <em>make package/symlinks</em>. After that, launch <em>make menuconfig</em> and go to <strong>Development</strong> sub-menu and you will see an entry called <em>gcc-mips</em>. With just the GCC compilers, there is nothing you can do to compile your software package which also depends on the uClibc or libc development packages.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>src-git qi_git git://projects.qi-hardware.com/openwrt-packages.git</code></pre></div>									</div>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>Thank you for your answer.<br />My router is a TP-Link TL-WR1043N/ND v1 running OpenWrt 12.09 &quot;attitude_adjustment&quot;, but I thought I&#039;d put the question open enough so a wider audience could benefit of it. </p><p>I was thinking like &quot;after all, why should&#039;t a compiler package be available for the people who might want to compile a program on their routers?&quot;, and I guess you kind of answered me: Without the uClibc or libc development packages (which I believe it should be too big to fit in a normal router), gcc can&#039;t work.

If you had a Seagate Dockstar, you can install a debian ARM with GCC compilers and libc on its boot drive attached to a USB2 port. If you had a Seagate GoFLEX NET / Home, you can use a SATA drive as the boot drive.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Anyway, as I said, I put the question opened so it could be used for any (relatively) small program, but the program I wish to compile in the shorter term is an <a href="https://github.com/darrylb123/usbrelay">USB Relay controler</a>, as stated in the previous <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=233833/">post</a> I mentioned.</p></blockquote></div><p>Perhaps, porting this package to OpenWRT will make more sense?</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>I have added that line to feeds.conf file and I&#039;m currently compiling everything.

Honestly, I can tell you right off that the GCC will probably complain with some missing header files or no printf function. Then, when you try to link to produce an executable file, the linker will fail. There is a quick manual hack (not perfect) to remedy this issue. I used to perform this quick hack on my Seagate Dockstar. If my memory serves me right, the following steps are all you need:<br /></p><ol class="decimal"><li><p>Under your &lt;openwrt source root dir&gt;/build_dir/&lt;toolchain platform&gt; directory, you will need to copy linux-dev/include directory to the /usr/include directory on your router. Once you have done that, it will allow GCC to find the header files to compile the hello world program.</p></li><li><p>Under your &lt;openwrt source root dir&gt;/staging_dir/&lt;toolchain platform&gt; directory, you will need to copy both include and lib directories to your router to /usr/include and /usr/lib, respectively.</p></li></ol><p>When you perform the above two steps, there is a chance your router will not boot properly. So, do it at your own peril. As you progress, you will notice there will be a lot missing header files. The reason is simply most OpenWRT packages don&#039;t include header files. If you want to fix this, I believe you will need to modify OpenWRT packages Makefile to include the header files.</p>									</div>
