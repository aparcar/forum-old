					<p>Just installed OpenWRT 12.09 in my router, but became a little confusing about interfaces/bridges/vlans, please help me to understand!</p><p>After my first boot, I logged in and setted my root password, so I used Luci to activate my wifi, and took me a little to figure out that I could bridge wifi with lan to get access to the internet. But I ended up with two problems:</p><p> 1. The DHCP adresses are been provided by my ISP (which is bad since I have to pay an extra tax for each IP)<br /> 2. I cant block ssh tries from the internet, so my router is a bit vulnerable.</p><p>How should I configure (preferably by Luci, since I do not have the time to learn a lot now) to get:</p><p> - DHCP provided by this router to my internal devices, with resolving of device names (DNS)<br /> - My external address (lan/eth0) provided by the ISP modem (so I can&#039;t simple block port 68 in this interface)<br /> - Properly configure my interfaces so I can allow ssh only on internal (wan/radio0) interface</p><p>Which and why I should choose to use bridge or VLAN? This article[1], do not explain it, nor provide any glue.</p><p>----------<br />Some notes:<br /> - I&#039;m a gentoo user, so I consider myself a good learner, but haven&#039;t yet found any good references to OpenWRT<br /> - My device is TP-Link TL-MR3020[2] by the way it have only one lan/eth0 iface and one wireles/radio0 one.</p><br /><p>&nbsp; [1]: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network/switch">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network/switch</a><br />&nbsp; [2]: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-mr3020">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-mr3020</a></p>									</div>
