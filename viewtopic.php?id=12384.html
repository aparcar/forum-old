					<p>You have not written this information. I took what i knew:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>2007.02.22 20:35:55 SiLeK&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;asus WL-500gP + OpenWRT 0.9 + X-wrt<br />2007.02.22 20:36:19 SiLeK&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;x-wrt stable<br />2007.02.22 20:38:07 SiLeK&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;printserver p910nd, printer HP 840c</p></blockquote></div><p>It is not possible to change the cups backend behavior (without a recompilation).</p><p>You can try to add the proto_bias=1 (the unidirectional protocol) parameter in the /etc/modules.d/60-usb-printer (after the word printer in White Russian or usblp in Kamikaze) for the usb printer class driver. This way you can disable the bidirectional capability of the driver/printer. Notice that you will also disable using a better protocol for other devices.</p><p>There were several printers that advertised the bidirectional capability but required the unidirectional handling for the proper work. These printers are included in the driver&#039;s exception table and should be handled properly (including your 840C).<br />Just for the curiosity, can you tell me the vendor/device information? The included exception is for the device vendor=0x03f0, device=0x0604 (HP DeskJet 840C).</p>									</div>

I&#039;m using 3 printers and it was messy if they were turned on in different order than it was in setup. Additionally p910nd has problems with handling errors. On Win XP often the docs stayed in queue for hours.<br />So in my particular situation I needed something more complex and CUPS seems to be just fine.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>kebul wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Notice that you will also disable using a better protocol for other devices.</p></blockquote></div><p>So if I&#039;m using 3 printers then after this setup all of them will use unidirectional handling?
