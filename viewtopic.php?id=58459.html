					<p>Hi there,</p><p>I&#039;ve got a small openwrt router here, which seems to have hardware SPI.<br />The pins a called:<br />SPI_MISO<br />SPI_MISI<br />SPI_CLK<br />SPI_CS1</p><p>When i connect a cable to MISI (not called MOSI, perhaps a mistake?), the device still boots without a problem ( can see it via USB -&gt; serial interface).<br />If i connect the cable to a MCP3008 or touch the stripped end of the cable, the device does not start anymore.<br />It takes 1-3s for it to be able to reboot after releasing the cable again.</p><p>As I am quite new to this, i have don&#039;t have an idea what mistakes I am doing here <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Hopefully someone can help&nbsp; &nbsp;me here!</p><p>Z oc om</p>									</div>

					<p>What are you trying to achieve here by connecting to the SPI pins? They&#039;re most likely for programming the flash chip, I wouldn&#039;t expect to use them while the device is running.</p><p>What&#039;s the make &amp; model of the router?</p>									</div>
