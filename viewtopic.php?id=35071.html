					<p>Hi all.<br />I&#039;m desperately trying to make multiwan working but am lacking some important&nbsp; imformation.<br />The main &quot;documentation at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/multiwan">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/multiwan</a> is quite incomplete as there is little or no details about the various parameters.<br />Moreover, the main status page of the web UI is showing only 1 WAN while the &quot;Multiwan&quot; section disappears and requires me to manually restart the multiwan rc script.<br />Is there any other information source, possibly with more details and descriptions?<br />Many thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>well, I don&#039;t really see how multiwan is related to hardware hacking - you would probably find better experienced people in general discussion or 10.03 area.<br />anyway, if you want to get some help, you should give a few more information on your setup and what you did (logs). also, I would recommend to stick to configure in cli until it works.</p>									</div>
