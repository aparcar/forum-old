					<p>Hey Guys -</p><p>I&#039;ve been using OpenWRT for a while and love it - even over DDWRT and others.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to set up Remote Management of Luci and want it to be secure so wish to use SSL/HTTPS.&nbsp; I see that there&#039;s no simple option to do this in Luci, so assume it must be done manually.</p><p>After searching for a few things, I&#039;ve already installed luci-ssl and am able to access Luci via HTTPS now.&nbsp; I would think the only other thing to do would be to forward a port to my router&#039;s IP and local port of 443.&nbsp; </p><p>My question is that I am getting a warning when connecting via HTTPS so also wish to add my own (purchased) 3rd party ssl cert which is for my home domain name.&nbsp; I can&#039;t figure out how to do it.&nbsp; I would guess it would have to be added via SSH commands, but when searching can&#039;t seem to find anything that seems to be the steps I&#039;m looking for.&nbsp; Also, I don&#039;t know what type of cert is needed so don&#039;t know if I need to convert mine or even where to put it.</p><p>Does anyone know what I need to do or know a link to the steps / commands I need to perform?&nbsp; Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>With a real https server, you don&#039;t need to port forward you can just open port 443 and access the https server directly from the Internet.</p><p>Your authentically signed certificate would just replace the self-signed certificate that a usual setup uses.&nbsp; Wherever that file is, replace it.</p>									</div>
