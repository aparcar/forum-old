					<p>I have ddwrt installed on a dir-825 and would like to switch this to an openwrt build. There is no sysupgrade on the ddwrt install and the mtd devices on the ddwrt install are not the same as openwrt so I&#039;m not sure how to write the flash with the openwrt build.</p><p>The ddwrt build mtd devices are :<br />mtd0: 00050000 &quot;RedBoot&quot;<br />mtd1: 007b0000 &quot;linux&quot;<br />mtd2: 0051c000 &quot;rootfs&quot;<br />mtd3: 00170000 &quot;ddwrt&quot;<br />mtd4: 00010000 &quot;nvram&quot;<br />mtd5: 00010000 &quot;FIS directory&quot;<br />mtd6: 00010000 &quot;board_config&quot;<br />mtd7: 00800000 &quot;fullflash&quot;</p><p>I&#039;ve made a backup copy of the mtd device files in case I mess this up.</p><p>Can anyone give some ideas on how I can do this conversion?</p>									</div>

					<p>New to OpenWRT coming from dd-wrt as well on a DIR-825 B1 that I have been having some issues with.</p><p>Anyway, as technically oriented as I am (thought I was) I can&#039;t quite figure out:</p><p>1. Which firmware download to choose from this page for my DIR-825 B1<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09.2/ar71xx/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09.2/ar71xx/</a></p><p>After I know that, I believe I can use the Firmware recovery mode option to install OpenWRT on my router EVEN THOUGH I have dd-wrt already installed? If not, do I need to revert to the stock D-Link firmware first like it was mentioned above and then flash Open-WRT? I would prefer to use a browser to do this. I am running Windows 7 64-bit and I do have IE 9 (Also have access to Windows Vista and other browsers if that would be better).</p><p>Any other major concerns I should be aware of that might be dramatically different from installing DD-WRT?</p><p>Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>b00ky</strong> on 28 Feb 2012, 15:30)</p>

					<p>@arduus and anyone else interested...</p><p>I know my questions was a little less involved that be50&#039;s but I am curious what Backfire is. Is it a beta version of an upcoming release?

					<p>@Orca</p><p>Yes, you could have just suggested the link and realized I did search the forums to some extent to find this post.
