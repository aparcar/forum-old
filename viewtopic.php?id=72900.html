					<p>I changed the thread, not to blur a content.<br />Reading forums on the topic, seems that people tend to install<br />successfuly, with some percent of failure, mostly on version 4.<br />Would someone clarify exact steps to do that, regarding both<br />versions? Wiki tends to be obsolete?<br />I will know what is current version in the shop only tomorrow,<br />when I read it on the box with my own eyes, as always.<br />Best regards.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zoranfooboo</strong> on 2 Jan 2018, 18:12)</p>

					<p>No mention of version 4.<br />There was a thread regarding this, but I cannot find it right now.<br />That thread made me nervous and ready to ask a question here.<br />I&#039;m eager to hear what was done from someone successful in<br />installing on 1043.<br />Best regards.</p>									</div>

					<p>Still waiting to learn what version of router it is, 3 or 4.<br />I found that on 3 I should install 15.5 first, than write<br />15.5.1 in temp dir and update from it.<br />For version 4 I would probably install trunk. I assume<br />there is no luci. opkg update and install luci probably.<br />Any experience with that in forum?</p>									</div>

					<p>Using LEDE for 1043NDv4. Built my own image. Works.<br />menuconfig allows various versions of 1043.<br />Look for ready-to-run image, which should be there in trunk, t least.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks.<br />Trunk would probably be the only solution. Cannot build an image,<br />since I use freebsd regurarly. An image seams to be small, so no<br />luci? I have to install it latter, I assume.<br />You helped me&nbsp; a lot. I was desperate to find version 3. Whatever I<br />find, would make me no headache.<br />Best regrads.</p>									</div>
