					<p>Well i got my 703 awhile ago and its a great little box, even better once OpenWRT is loaded! I decided to pop mine open and see what was inside and i found there is quite a lot of space. This got me thinking about fitting a flashdrive inside, but I didn&#039;t want to loose the external usb. I decided a hub was needed!</p><p>After a bit of a search on ebay i decided to get one of these as the flying leads would be ideal to remove: <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/190540919713">http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/190540919713</a><br />Turns out i was right, its perfect for hacking apart. You can also see my tiny 8gig flash drive which is only a fraction larger than a USB connector once the case is removed.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9511833/IMAG0352.jpg" alt="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9511833/IMAG0352.jpg" /></span></p><p>I stripped the board and cut the boots off the USB sockets. These turned out to be ideal to reuse as well.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9511833/IMAG0354.jpg" alt="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9511833/IMAG0354.jpg" /></span></p><p>The back of the hub PCB was bare apart from 1 crystal, so i decided to mount 2 sockets on it with double sided tape.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9511833/IMAG0355.jpg" alt="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9511833/IMAG0355.jpg" /></span><br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9511833/IMAG0357.jpg" alt="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9511833/IMAG0357.jpg" /></span></p><p>Keeping the wires as short as possible, i soldered them back to the connector on the other side.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9511833/IMAG0356.jpg" alt="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9511833/IMAG0356.jpg" /></span></p><p>At this point i tacked the USB plug back on and tested it. Still worked!</p><p>Next i removed the USB socket from the 703 board and soldered flying leads into place.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9511833/IMAG0358.jpg" alt="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9511833/IMAG0358.jpg" /></span></p><p>Testing everything for size. I decided to use a 3rd USB socket from the hub, rather than the PCB mount one, for the external socket. This is fitted from the outside.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9511833/IMAG0359.jpg" alt="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9511833/IMAG0359.jpg" /></span></p><p>Flying leads from the 703 USB trimmed and soldered back to the hub. External socket wired in.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9511833/IMAG0360.jpg" alt="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9511833/IMAG0360.jpg" /></span></p><p>I covered the back of the hub PCB with insulating tape and used a hot glue gun to fix the USB socket to the case. Popped the hub in and got the wires nice and tidy with a pair of tweezers.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9511833/IMAG0361.jpg" alt="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9511833/IMAG0361.jpg" /></span></p><p>All tested and worked first time! To get the lid back on i had to cut the 2 plastic pillars off it. The 8Gb flash drive is set up with a 512Mb swap partition and the rest of it EXT3.</p><p>Im really pleased how this has gone together, let me know what you think!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>JamesA</strong> on 19 Jan 2012, 16:44)</p>

Desoldering the USB socket was probably the most risky part as one of the holes just wouldnt clear with my solder sucker.

					<p>Hi James, nice writeup and idea- </p><p>1 - you&#039;ve tested the new setup with more than 1 USB drive?<br />2 - how much current consumption (from 5V microUSB) does your hub add to base, in idle ? compared to normal USB?<br />3 - any temperature considerations adding inside the box?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Jim, thanks and glad you like it.</p><p>Yes I&#039;ve had it running with a 2nd 8Gb USB drive plugged in as well. Worked fine. I also tested a USB hard drive which also worked fine as it had its own power supply.</p><p>Not tested the power draw, bit I cant imagine its going to be a lot. I do want to put together a small battery pack to run it as well so that should give a good idea of consumption.</p><p>Had it on test on my desk at work all day yesterday and its was warm but stable. I popped the lid off towards the end of the day and the hub was quite warm. I need to get the glue gun out and stick the sockets on better as the double sided tape doesn&#039;t cut it. I&#039;m also going to replace the tape on the bottom with a small piece of that fibreglass insulation sheet stuff, like you find in mains transformers. Just need to track some down, I opened up 2 old UPS&#039;s today and didn&#039;t find any <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Great!</p><p>On the mainboard just to the right of the vertical 4 contacts for the original USB port - there are 2 holes. Were these originally used to anchor the original USB port (via solder?)?&nbsp; If so, maybe minimally cut the 4 connectors under the original USB port and leave that one in place, solder the HUB to this, then resolder one of the HUBs output to the USB port&#039;s pins? (I think you were building along the way with your example and seeing if itd work well)</p><p>Just an idea if others are using your guide as a template. Looks like plenty of space to bring an extra connector or two of those HUB&#039;s 4 thru the case, just melting through the plastic. </p><p>&#039;Waiting on mine to arrive from CN,</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jimbeans</strong> on 21 Jan 2012, 02:35)</p>

					<p>Yes thats exactly what those holes are. You could probably do something like that with the USB, its what i was thinking originally. You would need to remove the socket still as there is no access to the connectors from the back of the socket. Perhaps replace it with a different PCB mount socket or cut the case open once its removed. Mine went in the bin as i pulled one of the wires out while i was removing it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>JamesA</strong> on 21 Jan 2012, 03:40)</p>

					<p>Very nice hack!</p><p>Isn&#039;t the flash still too hot ? I&#039;ve seen these going quite toasty..</p><p>BTW guys, speaking of USB, I managed to improve the compatibility with &quot;bigger&quot; devices by adding a 100uF on the USB rail itself.

					<p>Thanks Buze, that&#039;s a nice addition you have done there too! I&#039;ll have a look through my junk box for a suitable cap and add it myself. What webcam to you use? I&#039;m looking for a cheap one to hook up myself. It does get a warm, but I&#039;ve had it running for 4 days solid and it was stable so quite happy with that.</p><p>Glad you like it Cave, I&#039;m sure you will be fine if you are careful with your soldering iron. You will have to see how it goes with that hub, hard to tell the size until you have it to hand. The hub i used was the 2nd one I ordered, the 1st was too big to fit inside. Let us know how you get on <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I&#039;ve now used my hot glue gun to fix the sockets onto the PCB and I&#039;ve replaced the tape with a piece of 0.5mm PTFE sheet cut to size. Much better all round.</p><p>The USB stick is the 8gb one of these: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/89tlnd5">http://tinyurl.com/89tlnd5</a><br />Id had it awhile and the plastic was cracked so I removed it. Turned out its actually a microSD card in reader so I replaced the card with a faster class 8 card I had spare. I&#039;m planning to get a Sandisk Cruzer Fit sometime to see what they perform like as they are tiny too.</p><p>Currently im using firmware build by Twinclouds that includes USB, tools and LUCI which works really well. Try dropping him a PM and see if he will share if you are interested. I used his instructions, which were taken from the wiki to get EXTROOT working. Should work fine on vanilla firmware as long as you have USB etc installed already.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>Twinclouds wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>1.

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m looking at doing a similar mod but with the powered 7-port version of these &quot;octopus&quot; hubs so I can use more peripherals. I&#039;ve noticed that if the 307N is powered via micro usb and then a powered hub is installed via the normal usb port, the micro usb cable can be removed and power will still be provided (i.e. the 307N stays up by switching to drawing its power from the hub). However, if only the powered hub is connected when the 307N is switched then it won&#039;t boot. So it seems the router can draw power from the normal usb port but it won&#039;t boot in this configuration.</p><p>A solution is to simply connect one of the hub&#039;s 7 ports to the 307N&#039;s micro usb, but it would be cleaner if I could hack the board to allow the hub to power it via the normal usb port from scratch. Does anyone know whether this might be possible and have any suggestions I could look into?</p>									</div>

					<p>most likely you have sorted your problem, mcarthb, but you can take power and gnd from the hub (most likely a couple of big pads with lots of connections already attached). <br />As the data lines on the microUSB are n/c, you just need to wire the power to the relevant pins (might as well get rid of the socket, replace it with a bayonet socket (or something else of your choice) and attach the serial pads to it for easy access.</p>									</div>
