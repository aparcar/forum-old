					<p>Hallo fellow forum users,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to make my network accessible from outside and have to work around some ISP restrictions. The ISP uses DS-lite, so my cable modem uses the AFTR for IPv4 connections and receives its very own IPv6 address. The modem itself has built-in routing functionality and when connected directly to the modem, my devices receive their own public IPv6 addresses. However, this is not a solution as the cable modem is a Technicolor TC-7200, running a heavily modified (read: crippled) firmware. That is, if I want my network to be the least bit secure, I shouldn&#039;t go that way. The biggest problem here is that the web management console still shows the option to run the modem in bridge mode, but the firmware does not allow that. Setting it to bridge mode and saving the settings just reverts it back to router mode. It is possible to set it to bridge mode via SNMP while it&#039;s offline, but as soon as it connects to the cable network it is set back&nbsp; to router mode as well.</p><p>Now, there&#039;s a TP-Link TL-WDR3600 (hardware version 1.4) sitting right next to the modem, running the stock firmware for now. It does have IPv6 support but cannot assign public IPv6 addresses to my devices with the current configuration. I was hoping that I could do something about that if I ran OpenWRT on the TP-Link. However, Barrier Breaker does not perform well on the device as it leads to severe packet losses and that ultimately makes it unusable. There are some posts saying that Attitude Adjustment works well and I&#039;m still trying to compile the latest version.</p><p>My question is: should I even bother to install any version that performs well on the TP-Link? Unfortunately there&#039;s absolutely no way to make the modem run in bridge mode and the whole point of using OpenWRT is to make my network accessible from outside.</p>									</div>
