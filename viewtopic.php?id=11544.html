					<p>Hi there,</p><p>I am really stuck with my NP18A (8MB), eventhough it is listed under supported devices, the kernel does not run.<br />So I am looking for any box that runs openwrt or can really run OpenWRT and has Atheros Wifi. <br />So if anybody has a box with Atheros Wifi that runs or can run OpenWRT, I will be glad to buy it.</p><p>Rgds,<br />h0rus</p>									</div>

					<p>What about LaFonera 2100/2200? I have some units of this router run DD-WRT v24 RC5 with no problems, yet.

					<p>I got success in running Openwrt on AR430W yesterday.<br />I am in process of preparing my summary for others. But a quick note is that you need to recompile from openwrt source to include AR430W board support. Not a huge process but minor changes to get it UP.

					<p>I&#039;m using an AR430w and I got the wireless to start using the kamikaze trunk and a small modification to the kernel config to remove GPIO (so it doesn&#039;t hang on boot):<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Airlink/ARxxxW#head-ace8f94cb866dbd9ba09ef5ffc7f46daf6b66e36">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har … daf6b66e36</a></p><p>The 430w is a AR2317 and ap61-based device so kamikaze trunk should work on the d-link routers as well</p><p>I haven&#039;t extensively tested it yet.
