					<p>Hello everyone !</p><p>I&#039;m new in the network administration and I&#039;m trying to hide my local Network.</p><p>I&#039;m a student and in my room there is only a RJ45 plug in the wall. I bought a TPLINK MR3020 to share internet to all my devices in wifi. The thing is that my internet provider is tracking my PC MAC address through a captive portal. So I need to give the router my PC&#039;s MAC address and hide all my devices behind this TPLINK.</p><p>I&#039;ve found the override MAC address checkbox , but I don&#039;t understand the all NAT/DNAT/SNAT thing on the wiki.</p><p>Can you help me step by step please ?</p><p>PS: internet works great by wifi, but only one device at the time since I&#039;m not hidden behind the router.</p>									</div>

					<p>Your PC is already &quot;hidden&quot; by the router in the default configuration. That&#039;s what NAT is. Your PC&#039;s MAC address is never shown outside the LAN.</p><p>I&#039;d be surprised if the captive portal actually picks up your MAC address I think to do that it would need some kind of plugin? I wouldn&#039;t recommend changing the MAC address of your router to the same as your PC, then your router wouldn&#039;t be able to communicate with it.</p><p>Did the router get an IP address from the RJ45 connection? If not, that&#039;s where you should start troubleshooting.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok so:<br />I configured the LAN interface to be a DHCP client. Now I can access to the pages that the captive portal allow me to (science and maths and news sites since i&#039;m in a student room). So, it means that if I can use my login and password that I normally use with my computer on the portal, I can have internet access.</p><p>But no, it always redirect me to <a href="https://wireless.wifirst.net:8090/goform/HtmlLoginRequest">https://wireless.wifirst.net:8090/gofor â€¦ ginRequest</a> (only when i&#039;m logging in through the router). <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>renaiku</strong> on 30 Aug 2014, 08:59)</p>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have a similar problem, could you please tell how you managed to configure the LAN interface to be DHCP and the wifi &quot;normal&quot; (handled by the router)? Could I have a look at your config files?</p><p>Also, the way my captive portal checks if it should log me off or not is via pings to my router. How could I make sure that these pings get a response? Or would this work by default?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
