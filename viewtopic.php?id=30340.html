					<p>I want to use a TP-Link WR1043-ND connected to three external sector antennas mounted on a vertical pole each covering approx 90-120 degrees. The router would be mounted up the pole between the antennas to minimize rf cable loss.</p><p>This is much like the configuration of present cell towers. </p><p>My question is: Can the wifi hardware/software in this router be configured to do this? </p><p>As I read, mimo is multiple input and output channels to one device. </p><p>That is not what I want to do here. Each radio channel may not see the devices connected to the other channels.</p><p>Anybody have experience doing such a thing?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Perazim</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, </p><p>I don&#039;t think this setup will work well, and I don&#039;t think you will get the expected bandwith-gain of 3 sector-antennas if they are connected to one (mimo)wificard.</p><p>If you really want to use 3 sectorantennas you should get 3 wificards and a board which could hold them (routerstation (pro), mikrotik routerboards,...) with this setup you could run every sector antenna on a different channel which would minimize the interference. </p><p>If you need high bandwith in each sector, you could use a mimo-sector-antenna. this antennas can send a vertial-polarized stream and the horizontal-polarized stream in the same direction (2t2r). </p><p>the question is what do want to achieve, and whats your budget. </p><p>big budget and many clients which connects from different destinations 3 sectorantennas + 3 wificards. If you need high bandwith maybe mimo-sector-antennas and mimo-wificards. <br />little budget only one wifi and invest your money in a good omidirectional antenna.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for input - I have been away for a while.</p><p>I read the Atheros and others documentation regarding mimo technology and understand your comments.</p><p>I have a followup question: I am told that the 2.4Ghz band has overlapping channels. If I used 4 sectored antennas each covering a separate 90 degree area and 4 different radios on different channels on the same mast or tower, would the radios interfere with each other because of proximity? </p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Perazim</p>									</div>
