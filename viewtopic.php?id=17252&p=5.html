					<p>Well, playing along with a hardware that you don&#039;t know anything about, flashing with 3rd party, other producers firmware might be riski. You can brick your device to unrecoverable point if specyfication, bootloader, memory configuration do not match from source to copy.</p>									</div>

					<p>There is no easy answer to your question. Maybe for a unknown hardware first of all I would use some kind of sniffer, packet capturer. (like wireshark). Monitor the interface which is connected to your device to see if is there any traffic (ARP) in between device and connected computer. Besides you still have to know your hardware specyfication.

					<p>Hello, sorry to reactivate a very old thread... Well, im curious about the WA500G firmware running on a WR340G... I&#039;ve tryied to get a backup of the SPI flash, but SPIPGM fails (I have to add some buffers). However, I would like to flash directly the WA500G firmware, because I&#039;ve readed that xssa mentioned &quot;WA500G firmware runs natively on WR340G&quot;. Of course, that needs some header tweaks of the new firmware. Anyone knows how to do that? I&#039;ve compared 2 o 3 firmwares (.bin from TP-LINK website) and I can&#039;t get a header structure.<br />Also, I want to add, that I have the following data:<br />Firmware running by default:<br />4.7.7 Build 100825 Rel.65237n<br />And what the firmware says about the board:<br />WR340G v5 0815311C</p><p>Oh, I forgot to say, the WEBUI says that the .bin (previously posted here, the vxkiller stuff) is wrong. A little of help there would be awesome.</p><p>Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>coco_arg</strong> on 11 Jun 2011, 06:50)</p>

					<p>Update - new Tplink firmwars have changed firmware tags and they support newer hardware versions (v3.1 on back stiker, with Atheros ar8236 switch chip instead on Marvel one on older versions, v2.24 in sticker) So you can not downgrade this newer firmwares with older ones, and they even remove them from their official support page. Vxkiller image also does not support this ar8236 chip found in this new hw versions - LAN/WAN ports will not work. For the same reason modified Tl-WA500 firmware will not work on this newer hardware. <br />But there is solution for those who have older hardware with newer firmware -&nbsp; you can downgrade fw with special image and then go as usual.
