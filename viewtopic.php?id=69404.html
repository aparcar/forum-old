					<p>Hi</p><p>I have an openWRT router with couple of VLANs setup right now . See the image link below.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bw6hYCwjFtvoMHRRMGdhRl9rbHM" alt="network diagram" /></span><br />or<br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bw6hYCwjFtvoMHRRMGdhRl9rbHM">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bw6hY â€¦ GdhRl9rbHM</a></p><p>config files are as below so that devices in 192.168.3.0/24 are able to access resources in 192.168.1.0/24. We only want one way access, ie, 192.168.3.0 ---&gt; 192.168.1.0. That is why there is only one &quot;config forwarding from work -&gt; lan&quot;.</p><p>Devices in 192.168.3.0/24 can access the Unix file server just fine, but cannot even ping the Windows file server.</p><p>I dont think it&#039;s the windows file server that is at fault, devices within 192.168.1.0/24 can access it fine. It&#039;s only when trying to reach it from 192.186.3.0/24, we are having trouble.

					<p>With your current configuration, the machines at VLAN1 are receiving packets from machines at VLAN2; I would check that the firewall at the windows file server is configured to accept packets from 192.168.3.0. You could also enable NAT from VLAN3 to VLAN1, so all traffic will seem to come from the router.</p>									</div>
