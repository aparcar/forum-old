					<p>Background: I have a netgear with openwrt installed. I have a server connected to it. But.. I don&#039;t have a public IP as far as I can tell <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> whatever I connect to the modem, gets a 10 address, and can&#039;t change it&#039;s configuration.</p><p>I&#039;d like to access my server from the internet, ssh, web page, maybe ftp... any suggestion?</p><p>I guess I can&#039;t use things like dyndns. I have seen yosti.net, but has anyone tried it? from the faq, looks like they have a linux client, does anyone know if I can run it from my netgear with openwrt?</p><p>would opening a contract with a random other vpn provider help me? other solutions? ideas?</p><p>^--^<br />Steph</p>									</div>

					<p>Then your server should create port mapping or vpn passthough point to your private IP.<br />As you will connect to a dynamic IP from internet, you should find a way to know what is your current IP.</p><p>Dynamic DNS service would be the only solution for dynamic IP.<br />Then your server or the workstation behind your server should install a client program to up your IP,<br />OR, Openwrt ddns also able to update your public IP to ddns.<br />openwrt ddns support noip dyndns changeip dnsdynamic etc.</p><p>I don&#039;t understand why you said you can&#039;t use those things,<br />it is impossible.</p>									</div>

					<p>that you are in a 10.x.x.x subnet says nothing about if you have a dedicated public IP or not.

Suggestions for good and cheap openvpn-gateway? extra points if I can run the client on an openwrt netgear. I looked a little bit for tunnel or vpn providers, but couldn&#039;t find any that would give me a public ip for myself?</p><p>If I went for a virtual server somewhere, I would probably need an extra IP to forward all the traffic to my home pc? Or maybe just live with running stuff out of non standard ports? the chepest I could find is still around 4 EUR per month without the extra IP.</p><p>From the faq on yosti.net, seems like they do what I need. Has anyone here tried it? I tried to register, but seems like I need an invitation to use it :-( The faq also says that the client runs on linux, but couldn&#039;t download it until I register.</p><p>kThx,<br />Steph</p>									</div>
