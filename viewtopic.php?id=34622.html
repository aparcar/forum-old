					<p>If you find what driver your device uses, you can just look at the source available in the kernel sources. For example, an Atheros 802.11N device uses the ath9k driver. </p><p>In theory it&#039;s possible to modify the driver as you wish, since it&#039;s open source. However, depending on what you want to do, this could be complicated. Also, modifying very low-level behavior may require information about the device firmware, and the specs for this are often not publicly available.</p>									</div>
