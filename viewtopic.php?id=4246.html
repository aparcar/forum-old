					<p>What do you mean by external IP address ? If you are looking for the &quot;WAN&quot; port MAC addressm it is usualy the same, unless you specify one in wan_hwaddr</p>									</div>

					<p>Consider I have 3 switch ports in use by computers. Since the Linksys is a switch it must store MAC addresses in a lookup table to forward packets to the approriate computers (layer 2, not looking to get IP address) once received in its buffers. </p><p>I&#039;m not sure how the tables are implemented but would be the equivalent of an ARP cache on a computer though I do not think they are the same.</p><p>I want to be able to learn the MAC addresses of the computers the switch learns about and which Linksys port the&nbsp; &nbsp;MAC addresses are connected to. We&#039;ve ported an agent to the Linksys platform and this information would be useful.</p>									</div>
