					<p>Hi,</p><p>I can confirm very similar symptoms with my WNDR3800 on 2.4 and 5 GHz, tested with MacBook Pro.<br />Tried with different TX power, distance and channel settings, but results only got worse, dropping to ~10 Mbps.<br />Unfortunately, I ended up with the stock firmware, though its printing support for Mac doesn&#039;t work for me for some reason.</p><p>Is there any additional wi-fi settings I can try? Or any diagnostics I can run and post information so you can help me refine the problem?</p><p>Thank you!</p>									</div>

					<p>I installed dd-wrt, and out of the box my speeds were just half of those I had with stock firmware, though better than with openwrt. Here&#039;s what i done to get stable 108 Mbps speeds on 5GHz with MacBook Pro Mid 2009:<br /> - Locked mode to 802.11n-only, locked one channel;<br /> - Channel width set to Dynamic 20/40 (my laptop doesn&#039;t connect if it&#039;s set to 40, or has half of the speed if it&#039;s set to 20);<br /> - Set security to WPA2/AES only (dd-wrt explicitly states that it&#039;s a requirement for 802.11n according to its specs);<br /> - TX power was at 20 dBm, i didn&#039;t touch that.</p><p>Please tell if this settings help you on openwrt, I may then switch back to it later)</p>									</div>

					<p>This is normal on devices with ar92xx/ar93xx and more than 1 chain, something in the ath9k module make it fuck up the tx queue, and blam no wifi or if youre lucky, just high ping times, depending on the kernel version patches and so on...</p><p>Login to telnet/ssh and type dmesg, i will bet my right assbun that its filled up with errors like this : <br />[50297.500000] ath: phy0: Failed to stop TX DMA, queues=0x001!<br />[50297.520000] ath: phy0: DMA failed to stop in 10 ms AR_CR=0x00000024 AR_DIAG_SW=0x42000020 DMADBG_7=0x000084c0<br />[50297.530000] ath: phy0: Could not stop RX, we could be confusing the DMA engine when we start RX up</p><p>There is no solution yet, since almost everyone reject to realize that this actualy is a bug, and its a reintroduced bug......</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m actually suspecting it might be either hostapd or an interaction between it and ath9k... I am running a modified (removed most of the extra OpenWrt patches) hostapd on my WR1043ND and it completely solved the stability and ping issues. Bandwidth is still sucky at 2,5MB/s but at least it does not drop down to 500kB/s anymore. So far this build has run trouble free since the 9th. I will try to find the offending patch when I have more time.</p>									</div>

					<p>No. Many of the outstanding issues tend to require access to datasheets and chip specifications so debugging work is limited to bisecting which obviously only makes sense if there ever was a good working version to begin with. Another bunch of interop issues is caused by lacking UAPSD support in ath9k, the &quot;fix&quot; for these class of issues would be implementing it - which, again, requires driver level knowledge.</p>									</div>

					<p>But it works ok with dd-wrt, so at least in that firmware there&#039;s working code for ath9k. Can it be ported somehow from dd-wrt?<br />(Please forgive me if I don&#039;t know the key differences between the two that would make it impossible).</p>									</div>

					<p>DD-Wrt uses proprietary drivers which we cannot use - and judging from the reports in their forums it does not seem to &quot;work okay&quot; either.</p>									</div>
