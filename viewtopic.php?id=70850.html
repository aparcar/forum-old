					<p>I was given a new-in-the-box Buffalo WHR-300HP2 yesterday. The device seems to be working fine on factory firmware. I&#039;d like to run OpenWRT on it. The ToH has&nbsp; link to an upgrade image but not a factory install image.</p><p>It seems that the initial install must be done via tftp. That doesn&#039;t bother me, as I do that every day at my day job (I&#039;m an embedded firmware developer). It seems, though, that that needs to be done with the factory install image, and I can&#039;t seem to find one anywhere.</p><p>Once I get over that hump, the rest is simple, but that one bit has me stopped. Am I going to have to build the factory image myself, or...?</p>									</div>
