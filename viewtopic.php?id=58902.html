					<p>Is it possible to take the OpenWRT code, modify it, add some proprietary stuff (drivers, backdoors, restricted web GUI - you name it) and build a proprietary modem/router firmware?<br />Then publish an incomplete source code (to formally comply with the GPL) - without the proprietary stuff. Of course the source code wouldn&#039;t compile because of the missing proprietary files. So it&#039;s useless to try to create the firmware using that published source code. To make sure that no proprietary binary drivers can be extracted the firmware binary could also be encrypted.</p><p>- Would that be legal? (lots of source code in OpenWRT is GPL v2)<br />- Which legal system would apply - only the legal system of the country where I am selling devices with that firmware? or also legal systems of other countries where I operate in?<br />- If it&#039;s not legal - what steps could be done against that?</p><p>ps: I am asking because I am still trying (without success) to compile a modem/router firmware published by a big german phone company. This firmware is based on OpenWRT. The published source code seems to be incomplete - missing some open source and proprietary components. The binary doesn&#039;t contain any readable strings, so I suspect it is compressed or encrypted. But I&#039;m a noob - so I don&#039;t want to make any accusations (yet).</p>									</div>

To separate the more general legal questions and the specific technical questions I had posted this info in another thread:<a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=58825">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=58825</a></p><p>There you will find the router name, a download link to the original firmware, and the results of my own efforts so far.
