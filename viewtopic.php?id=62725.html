					<p>Hello,</p><p>I would be very grateful if you can help me with configuring OpenWRT on TP-Link TL-WDR4300 router.</p><p>I have just installed Chaos Calmer - 15.05 by using Quick Start Guide (<a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300</a>). I can connect to it via openspc (to copy files) and ssh (putty). Unfortunately, I have no access to the internet (before installing OpenWRT I had) and documentation (https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/basic.config and <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/internet.connection)">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/internet.connection)</a> is not enough for me.</p><p>ISP is Vectra, IP is static (I&#039;m not 100% sure but I think it is). With original software I could connect to Internet without configuring anything (it worked out of the box even after restoring default settings by pressing reset button for more than six seconds). But with OpenWRT it cannot connect to Internet at all. I&#039;ve tried setting various things in &quot;Interfaces - WAN&quot; (for example provide the same IP and DNS as I had in the details of network connection in Windows with modem directly connected to the computer). It didn&#039;t work either.</p><p>So I wanted to restore oryginal firmware. I&#039;ve downloaded file from here (<a href="http://www.tplink.com/en/download/TL-WDR4300.html#Firmware">http://www.tplink.com/en/download/TL-WD â€¦ l#Firmware</a>), renamed it to file1.bin (but also tried without renaming), copied to temp with winscp, entered ssh with putty and tried:<br />sysupgrade -n /tmp/file1.bin<br />but I had:<br />Invalid image, it contains a bootloader.<br />Image check &#039;platform_check_image&#039; failed.<br />The same for the newest and one older version from the website.</p><p>In other words, I cannot use router with OpenWRT and I cannot restore to oryginal software. What are your advices?</p><p>Thank you!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wdr4300</strong> on 14 Feb 2016, 04:20)</p>

					<p>You should only be so lucky that OpenWrt didn&#039;t let you flash the image with the bootloader, because it would have made things significantly worse than they are now.</p><p>You need to find the original firmware with the boot sector cut out (check the OpenWrt wiki on your model for &quot;going back&quot; section). I believe there was a web-site which hosted TP-Link firmwares with the boot sector cut out or just find the original TP-Link firmware which DOES NOT have the word boot in the filename.</p>									</div>

					<p>First of all, did you try configuring your WAN interface other than static IP? Static IP configuration is rare for consumer oriented Internet service, as it requires more knowledge than necessary among customers. Even if an ISP issues static IP addresses to consumers, they are usually handed out via DHCP. I&#039;d try DHCP, if you didn&#039;t have to set your IP address in Windows connected directly, it doesn&#039;t make sense to set it in OpenWrt.</p><p>Assuming you have already decided to revert, on to this:</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>wdr4300 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>In other words, I cannot use router with OpenWRT and I cannot restore to oryginal software. What are your advices?</p></blockquote></div><p>You found documentation, now read it (specifically: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300#back_to_original_firmware">toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300#back_to_original_firmware</a>). Cutting the bootloader and flashing the image (which is not done with sysupgrade when reverting) is explained there. If you have downloaded a firmware image from TP-Link and saved it at /tmp/tplink.bin in OpenWrt, this should flash the firmware (with sanity checks, although no guarantees are given, obviously):</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dd if=/tmp/tplink.bin of=/tmp/noboot.bin skip=257 bs=512 &amp;&amp; if [[ &quot;$(wc -c /tmp/noboot.bin | awk &#039;{print $1}&#039;)&quot; -eq 8126464 ]]; then mtd -r write /tmp/noboot.bin firmware; else echo &quot;Something is wrong with noboot.bin&quot;; fi</code></pre></div>									</div>
