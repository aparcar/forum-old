					<p>Hi,</p><p>In a nutshell: I&#039;m running an OpenVPN client to give OpenVPN users access to a private IP subnet that is accessible through the WAN interface.&nbsp; I want to give the OpenVPN users access only to the private network, and I don&#039;t want them to reach the Internet through the VPN.</p><p>In more detail: on the WAN interface I have an alias for a private network (192.168.230.0/24) accessible on the WAN interface.&nbsp; I also have an interface tun0 named vpn, for the OpenVPN tunnel.&nbsp; I define them with the following in the /etc/config/network file:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface vpn
        option ifname    tun0
        option proto    none

config alias
        option interface wan
        option proto static
        option ipaddr 192.168.230.231
        option netmask 255.255.255.0</code></pre></div><p>To give the OpenVPN users access to the private network 192.168.230.0/24, I added the following in the /etc/config/firewall file:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config rule
    option src        wan
    option proto        udp
    option dest_port    1194
    option target        ACCEPT

config zone                     
        option name             vpn
        option input            REJECT
        option output           REJECT
        option forward          REJECT

config forwarding 
    option src      vpn
    option dest     wan</code></pre></div><p>Please note that for the vpn zone the default policy in the chains are REJECT, and yet the OpenVPN users can reach the private network! Initially I had them set to ACCEPT, but in the course of playing I discovered that I can put REJECT, and it doesn&#039;t matter.</p><p>My problem is that the OpenVPN can access the Internet through this configuration, i.e. they can set the default gateway to the OpenVPN gateway and have all their traffic routed to the Internet.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want this, as I want to allow access only to the private network.</p><p>How can I restrict the OpenVPN users only to access the private network?</p><br /><p>Thanks,<br />Irek</p>									</div>

					<p>I resolved the problem by adding to /etc/firewall.user the following:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -I FORWARD -s 192.168.200.0/24 ! -d 192.168.230.0/24 -j DROP</code></pre></div><p>The OpenVPN clients are in the 192.168.200.0/24 subnet, and I filter any traffic they send outsite 192.168.230.0/24.</p><p>However, I wonder it there is a more elegant solution to my problem.</p><br /><p>Best,<br />Irek</p>									</div>
