					<p>Reference: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=68947">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=68947</a></p><p>I am now trying to set up this same &quot;access point only&quot; configured Buffalo device as an OpenVPN server.&nbsp; &nbsp;The main router on my network is a telco fiber optic modem router which of course cannot run OpenWrt or OpenVpn.&nbsp; &nbsp;on this new &quot;access point only router&quot;, I have copied all the configuration files and firewall rules from working &quot;routing&quot; router and all the OpenWrt/OpenVpn set up from another Buffalo router that is working in a conventional configuration of WAN routing to LAN.&nbsp; &nbsp;OpenVPN on that conventional &quot;routing&quot; router works well.&nbsp; &nbsp;This &quot;routing&quot; router directly faces the ISP connection via its WAN port, and it routes as normal..</p><p>II am now working at a second location, remote from the example I just explained but with a copy of all the configuration data from the setup that works.&nbsp; At this new location as I have explained in prior posts, this OpenWrt setup has a LAN only entry in the Interface list and a static IP of 192.168.1.250 with the DHCP server disabled.&nbsp; &nbsp;(It also gained a VPN entry after I added all the needed Optware for OpenVPN).&nbsp; &nbsp;On my telco modem I have port forwarded 1194 to IP Address 192.168.1.250, the IP of the &quot;access point only&quot; functioning router.&nbsp; &nbsp;At this moment I copied all the VPN configuration files over to this router (LAN interface only) and I would like it to receive the traffic on port 1194 off the local LAN (in the same manner it receives it off the WAN at the other location I coped the configuration from) and offer a connection to that same LAN to remote clients.</p><p>It&#039;s not working.&nbsp; &nbsp;Can this even be done ?&nbsp; &nbsp;(before I spend any more time on it?)&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>I guess the first step would be to get the VPN server to listen for port 1194 on the local LAN like it typically does while listening on the WAN.&nbsp; &nbsp;Since there is no WAN interface configured after I deleted (this is just serving as an access point), how can it listen to the LAN instead?</p>									</div>

					<p>I discovered this write up which takes a much more complicated approach to making a router a dumb access point: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap</a></p><p>Will it perhaps be a better setup to try to get OpenVPN working?&nbsp; Again my telco fiber modem router is forwarding packets on 1194 to my OpenWrt router IP address.&nbsp; &nbsp;I want the OpenVPN to interface that to the local LAN, just like if the OpenWRT router was the main one facing the Internet.</p><p>On my setup, I didn&#039;t follow this procedure but cheated by just disabling everything in the Interfaces table but LAN, disabling DHCP server and just plugging in the LAN cable from the main router in the LAN switch which coincidentally gave me a quick setup up access point only which so far has proven taxing for attempting to use also as a OpenVPN server.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>DonJuane</strong> on 10 Feb 2018, 18:24)</p>

					<p>OK, I tried something else.&nbsp; &nbsp;I read in a non OpenWRT area on OpenVPN for Linux that the firewall must be available to route, so I re-enabled the firewall and I added the following which is used in my referenced regular router (home gateway) set that is working:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>****** Other firewall data removed for clarity
