					<p>I upgraded my Archer C5 from BarrierBreaker 14.07 to Chaos Calmer 15.05 and i still sense some problems or differences.</p><p>1. the WAN Connection got often problems (some disconnects)<br />2. the 2.4Ghz WLAN has lower speed. On 14.07 i got full 16Mbit, and now i only get 8/9mbits. (using N Mode on 40MHz)</p><p>Any ideas?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pro-zocker</strong> on 5 Oct 2015, 13:41)</p>

					<p>Ok, regarding your first problem, I don&#039;t have a clue. My WAN connection (configured as DHCP client) is stable on my Archer C7 v2 (which should behave the same as your C5 v1.2).</p><p>Regarding 2:<br />Try using 20MHz channel width. 40MHz doesn&#039;t work well in many cases, unless you live very isolated with no other wifis around.</p>									</div>
