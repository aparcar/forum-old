					<p>ive set up samba, and network sharing completely, anyway, i have my external harddrive mounted to /mnt, and can browse the folders just fine through putty, however, used smbpasswd Justin password to set up my password for my account, but when i try to access these shares, windows 7 tells me i need a network password, however, no password or login will work, my router login wont work, my samba information doesnt work, i just cant access these shares, and im wondering if this is an issue with samba because i can access other shares with these computers</p>									</div>

					<p>It worked perfectly for me on Windows 7 Professional, 64-bit!</p><p>It probably would be a good idea to add it to the wiki so that maybe it will be easier to find.</p>									</div>
