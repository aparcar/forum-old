					<p>Hi,<br />I got routerstation working (non-pro version) with operwrt, using some crappy radio. <br />It took a lot of effort, but I get only 11mbps. I think I need more (ftp gives only 100kb/s on some netbook) so I can stream video properly. <br />Can someone please recommend a well compatible radio that I could buy? <br />I already have OpenWRT configured, <br />*so it would be nice that openwrt would support it, <br />*it would have abgn support,<br />*good stable signal,<br />*would fit right on routerstation board (not oversized),<br />*would have U.FL connector (because I have already installed this cable).<br />Please? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/roll.png" width="15" height="15" alt="roll" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Breakable</strong> on 11 Dec 2010, 00:49)</p>
