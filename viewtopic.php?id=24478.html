					<p>I tried following the instructions in the wiki for installing Backfire on the DLink DIR-825 rev B1, to no avail.&nbsp; After a lot of messing around with it, I was finally able to install it by modifying the image and using the factory firmware&#039;s update (not the recovery mode).</p><p>What I found is that there seem to be two problems with the supplied image (openwrt-ar71xx-dir-825-b1-squashfs-backup-loader.bin)</p><p>1.&nbsp; The image suffix is wrong for the DIR-825 rev B1.&nbsp; In the supplied image, it is &quot;01AP94-AR7161-RT-080619-00&quot;.&nbsp; However, in the DLink firmware, it is &quot;00AP94-AR7161-RT-080619-00&quot;</p><p>2.&nbsp; The image suffix is apparently not at an offset that the DLink firmware upgrade process expects to find it.&nbsp; In the DLink firmware, the suffix begins at a file offset of exactly 0x400000.&nbsp; In the supplied OpenWRT image, it begins immediately after the last used byte of the image, at offset 0x250004.</p><p>I took the non-backup-loader image (without the suffix), padded it out with zeros to exactly four megabytes, then appended the suffix from the DLink firmware.&nbsp; Now the firmware upgrade page accepts and programs it just fine.&nbsp; I suspect that it will now work correctly in the recovery mode also, but I have not tried that.</p><p>It is possible that padding the image to a shorter length (e.g., 0x280000) might work, but I haven&#039;t tried it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>brouhaha</strong> on 25 Apr 2010, 09:34)</p>

					<p>Yes, I tried using those instructions, and they didn&#039;t work for me.&nbsp; That&#039;s why I spend hours screwing around with the image until I was able to make it work.&nbsp; If otther people are able to flash the released Backfire image into the DIR-825 from the stock firmware using the instructions on that page or on the wiki, I&#039;m baffled as to why it works for them but didn&#039;t for me.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, even if the regular instructions work perfectly for everyone but me, I&#039;ve found what it take to install OpenWRT through the stock firmware&#039;s normal upgrade process, without requiring the use of recovery mode.</p><p>It appears that recovery mode interacts poorly with all of the web browsers I&#039;ve tried (Firefox/Linux, Firefox/Mac, Safari/Mac).&nbsp; I get the web page, but the upload button never seems to actually do anything.&nbsp; May be something odd about my network, but I can access the stock firmware&#039;s web interface with no trouble, so it was worthwhile for me to spend the time figuring out how to make the normal firmware upgrade work.</p>									</div>

					<p>I just picked up a DIR-825 B1 yesterday too and am running into the same problems as you brouhaha trying to follow the directions at that fetzig.org site<br />Tried FF/linux, Chromium/Linux, FF/Win7, IE8/Win7 and all just time out.</p><p>So with that firmware you were fixing, by chance did you save the .bin file that&#039;s all repadded and has the fixed offset that you could post?&nbsp; Would at least save me the trouble figuring out how to pad it and fix that suffix with a hex editor myself.&nbsp; I&#039;m assuming it&#039;s from the backfire 10.03 branch right?</p>									</div>

					<p>Actually I think this should do the trick, right?

					<p>I just noticed that this issue was fixed by changeset 21171 (trunk) and 21226 (backfire) by juhosg on April 26 and 28, respectively.&nbsp; That was fast!&nbsp; Now the build creates images ending in &quot;-factory.bin&quot; which have the correct padding and suffix to work with the factory firmware&#039;s upgrade page.&nbsp; Thanks juhosg!&nbsp; W00t!</p>									</div>

					<p>brouhaha, thanks for the useful information. I&#039;m trying to install openwrt on the same router but the version is B2 instead of B1 and the stock firmware doesn&#039;t accept neither the provided image nor my own compiled image. Both of these images are really for for version B1 so I&#039;m not sure if that is the problem? any hints is appreciated. </p><p>Arash</p>									</div>

					<p>Brouhaha, hi! I&#039;ve been fighting to make dir-825 to be any useful. My configuration has L2TP for uplink and most recent Dlink firmware sporadically reboots after some 10-15 minutes and DD-Wrt ends up the same way. I already have two boxes and would like to give OpenWrt (backfire, kamikadze) a try. I cannot follow your changerset 21226 (backfire) advise - no clue how to make image builds myself. </p><p>Could you please publish somewhere a .BIN file that worked for you? Thank you in advance!</p>									</div>
