					<p>Hi!</p><p>I&#039;ve got a Linksys WRT54G3G router running WhiteRussian 0.9 Firmware.

					<p>Hi Dude,</p><p>The IP &#039;obtained&#039; on my laptop matches the one dnsmasq has offered. I tried giving the laptop a static IP based on its MAC address. This also works.... at least, it works in the fact that the IP address show up in &quot;ipconfig /all&quot; on the laptop:</p><p>Ethernet adapter Wireless Network Connection:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Connection-specific DNS Suffix&nbsp; . : mycompany.com<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Description . . . . . . . . . . . : Intel(R) PRO/Wireless 2200BG Network Connection<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Physical Address. . . . . . . . . : 00-11-22-33-44-55<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dhcp Enabled. . . . . . . . . . . : Yes<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Autoconfiguration Enabled . . . . : Yes<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IP Address. . . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.149<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DHCP Server . . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DNS Servers . . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lease Obtained. . . . . . . . . . : tuesday 17 april 2007 8:00:00<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lease Expires . . . . . . . . . . : wednesday 17 april 2007 8:00:00<br />(The above is not a copy-paste of the screen, but the IP values and settings are valid).</p><p>So it&#039;s (at least to me ;-) very weird that the IP address shows up, but Windows XP complains about not being able to acquire a network address. The WiFi-connection is not setup correctly and therefore not usable.</p><p>About the dnsmasq message: &quot;Ignoring DHCP host name mymachine.mycompany.com because it has an illegal domain part&quot;. Is dnsmasq really just ignoring the domain part or is it ignoring any packets received from my laptop? This last option might make the connection unusable.</p><p>Cheers,<br />Erik</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t get it either. The IPs shows up but XP is complaining having problems to obtain one... weird. You say it&#039;s talking about the wireless connection not setup corerctly. Are you using WPA or WPA2? If the later try WPA... i had that one time that XP was not connecting due to that. Maybe that helps.<br />Otherwise i have no clue.</p><p>bye<br />dude</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Dude,</p><p>With &quot;The wireless connection is not setup correctly&quot; I mean: Windows XP does not have a working wireless connection (although the WiFi adapter has received the IP address supplied by the router) after requesting it from/negotiating it with the router.</p><p>I&#039;ve used both non-secure, WPA and WPA2 as &#039;security&#039; setting. The result does not differ. Still &quot;limited or no connectivity&quot; as the Windows XP response.</p><p>My laptop is secured by PointSec (<a href="http://www.pointsec.com">http://www.pointsec.com</a>) not sure whether that may influence the laptops behaviour. My laptop will connect to my ADSL modem/router through WiFi, so it can do it...</p><p>Cheers,<br />Erik</p>									</div>

					<p>I was having a similar problem today while trying to get encryption working. I was able to connect to the router just fine using wired and wireless connections but with no encryption. Whenever I tried to use encryption the wireless connection didn&#039;t work.

					<p>Hi all,</p><p>This weekend I got mine working too. Not sure what the problem was though. The nas package was not my problem since I wasn&#039;t using any encypted connections (yet). I tried to keep things simple....uhu...</p><p>Finally did a &#039;mtd erase nvram&#039; and reconfigured the whole thing from scratch. That did the trick. Forgot to save the settings before the erasure, so not sure which settings where &#039;bad&#039;.</p><p>After firing it up again (after erase and reconfig) it worked like a charm. Have configured the encrypted connections now. And yes, don&#039;t forget to install &#039;nas&#039; package ;-).</p><p>I&#039;m probably going to add a cron job which changes the password for WPA/TKIP every month. A script with prerecorded passwords for the coming months will be on the router. Are there any off-the-shelf solutions for this? It will require some handling (getting the current date on the router, restarting the nas service) but nothing to difficult I suppose. But any OTS is appreciated.</p><p>Bye,<br />Erik</p>									</div>
