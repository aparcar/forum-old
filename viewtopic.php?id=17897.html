					<p>So here I am, I tried to tftp the new rc1 openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx image to my Asus wl700ge.&nbsp; Needless to say it is now bricked pretty well and I need help getting it back if possible.&nbsp; I have tried to get it back into service mode so I can tftp another(original image) by holding the ezsetup while connecting power, and then letting go when it goes solid after about 5 blinks of the blue ready light.&nbsp; I can not even get a response when I ping 192.168.1.1</p><p>I have a static IP setup on my Ubuntu machine.&nbsp; 192.168.1.22 snmask 255.255.255.0 gateway 192.168.1.1</p><p>How do I proceed from here?</p><p>Best Regards,<br />Will</p>									</div>

					<p>Once you connected it you should observe the boot process with - for example - minicom. For my WL-500GP I can use standard serial settings, not sure if they apply to a WL700* too, maybe try different combinatiosn if you don&#039;t get any output.&nbsp; You&#039;ll see what&#039;s wrong when the bootloader tries to boot the image.</p><p>~ JoW</p>									</div>

					<p>Just went looking for my old cell phone serial adapter but could not find it.&nbsp; So I guess I&#039;m on hold until I either find it, or replace it.&nbsp; Almost have the router out of the case, got the drive, drive housing, and power supply out of it.&nbsp; Seems to be difficult to get the board out though.</p><br /><p>PS: Hope to be up in Leipzig for some scuba diving next year :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>After many, many, many tries with erasing nvram, and letting it sit, and rebooting everything multiple times, it finally gave me:</p><br /><p>Initializing Arena<br />Initializing Devices.<br />et0: Broadcom BCM47xx 10/100 Mbps Ethernet Controller 3.90.23.0<br />rndis0: Broadcom USB RNDIS Network Adapter (P-t-P)<br />CPU type 0x29006: 264MHz<br />Total memory: 67108864 KBytes</p><p>So I quickly flashed the WL700gE_1.0.4.2_flash.trx file using tftp while the network was up and I have a working router again following <br /><a href="http://wl700g.homelinux.net/drupal/?q=node/54">http://wl700g.homelinux.net/drupal/?q=node/54</a></p><p>My assumption would be that it had to do with something in nvram being corrupt, and taking multiple erases for it to be gone.&nbsp; I honestly don&#039;t know, but it is working now.</p>									</div>
