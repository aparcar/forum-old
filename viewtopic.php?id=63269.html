					<p>Hi <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/profile.php?id=16333">jow</a>.<br />I saw you updated the homepage with the &quot;Wireless Battle of the Mesh v9&quot;.<br />It&#039;s very interesting, indeed.<br />Someone (You?) also did some refreshing to headlines, I see. It used to be 5 years outdated until last week!<br />Now it&#039;s only 3 years outdated by mentioning 12.09 final.<br />But you seem to be the one and only person (with a username) capable of modifying this wonderful project&#039;s homepage.<br />But it&#039;s impossible to contact you! Not even a message from the profile page!<br />There&#039;s been a number of tickets and forum posts about the status of the homepage since years now.<br />There&#039;s people willing to volunteer for keeping that page up to date.<br />There&#039;s been even someone who created a demo new homepage for reviewing.<br />But it&#039;s all in vain if none among those who can touch the homepage interacts with all this people.<br />Please, step in, open a discussion thread and let&#039;s see whether and how we all can contribute.<br />It&#039;s a real shame, otherwise, we keep a homepage: jut redirect it to the wiki!</p><p>Sorry for bothering you, anyway.</p>									</div>
