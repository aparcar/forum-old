					<p>The biggest reason why I chose to use the openwrt firmware was because I was looking for a way to be able to selectively block websites, mostly to be able to block tracking and advertising servers for privacy reasons.</p><p>Frankly, I am tired that I was not able to see who was collecting what, without my knowledge or approval.</p><p>I do use applications like the adblock plus, but it does not work on all internet browsers, also that devices like ipads, tables and phones on the wifi are not able able to easily block this traffic.</p><p>So, after a lot of research, I loaded the openwrt and been working on it getting my openwrt router to do the work of blocking thousands of tracking, advertising and spyware servers.</p><p>I am so happy with the results, that I wanted to share what it was that has worked so far.</p><p>I have done comparisons of speed, and by making this changes most websites load faster, but I think the websites are loading faster because background connections to 3rd party tracking servers are being rejected.</p><p>You can&#039;t block everything, but by following this steps you can block most of this unwanted traffic.</p>									</div>

					<p>First of all, the easiest way I found to edit the files I wanted to work on was copying the files from the router to my computer, editing it and copying it back. You can always do it directly on the router and edit by using the vi editor. </p><p>If you are on a Windows machine, you are might want to use apps like WinSCP for copying and gedit to edit files, windows notepad is not a good editor for Linux files. Both are free.</p><p>First File: /etc/firewall.user (Make a copy of the file before editing)<br />Add this 2 lines:</p><p>iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 53<br />iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 53</p><br /><p>Second File: /etc/dnsmasq.conf (Make a copy of the file before editing)</p><p>This file blocks entire domains, many of this providers like double-click and 2o7 have thousands of prefixed and its just easier to block the entire domain instead of individual domains.</p><p>Here is a sample:</p><p>address=/2o7.net/127.0.0.1<br />address=/207.net/127.0.0.1<br />address=/doubleclick.net/127.0.0.1<br />address=/doubleclick.com/127.0.0.1</p><p>Then restart dnsmasq service</p><p>killall dnsmasq<br />/etc/init.d/S60dnsmasq</p><p>Third File: /etc/hosts (Make a copy of the file before editing)</p><p>This is better for individual servers, remember to keep the 192.168.1.1 OpenWRT and 127.0.0.1 localhost.</p><p>The file I am using as a base is the one located here <a href="http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.zip">http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.zip</a>, even though the file looks good, you need to edit the ignored text that starts with #, the file did not work right right until I removed all the # notes on the file. I have a copy of the clean file but have nowhere to upload it to for you guys to get.</p><br /><p>Here is a sample</p><p>192.168.1.1 OpenWRT<br />127.0.0.1&nbsp; localhost</p><p>127.0.0.1&nbsp; ssl.google-analytics.com<br />127.0.0.1&nbsp; sb.google.com</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>frankhou77</strong> on 26 Feb 2012, 18:16)</p>

					<p>Here is a copy of my dnsmasq.conf file. Because it blocks entire domains the file is not that big, my host file on the other hand is really big, small enough to fit into my router but too big to copy/paste here, once I find a place to upload I will do that.</p><p>/etc/dnsmasq.conf</p><p>address=/2o7.net/127.0.0.1&nbsp;

					<p>Another way to do this would be to use Privoxy, it&#039;s built to do specifically what you&#039;re doing and can even be used to squash tracking cookies. There&#039;s a package for it for OpenWRT, it works extremely well on the trunk builds.</p><p><a href="http://www.privoxy.org">http://www.privoxy.org</a>/</p><p>Its much easier to manage that a huge hosts file / dnsmasq configuration.

					<p>While Apple devices may not be able to block the traffic, AdAway and more recently AdBlock are available for Android (neither in the market anymore as Google banned them on the grounds that they interfered with the proper operation of websites). You may also want to look at the source code for these as AdAway uses several sources for domain lists and integrates them automatically with the device&#039;s <em>hosts </em>file.</p>									</div>
