					<p>I&#039;ve spent a week playing with this, trying different firmware versions, reading the forum threads and the Wiki documentation, and I&#039;m still stumped.</p><p>I&#039;ve got a Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH with a powered USB2 hard disk hanging out of the USB port and configured with a couple of ext3 partitions. Right now the G300NH is running Backfire 10.03.1-RC5 (r27608).</p><p>Freshly-flashed, <strong>/dev/1-1</strong> appears when the hard disk is connected but no other evidence of external storage is seen.</p><p>If I install <strong>kmod-usb-storage</strong> and issue <strong>/etc/init.d/usb restart</strong> (or reboot the router) then <strong>/dev/sda</strong>, <strong>/dev/sda1</strong>, etc. appear.</p><p>If I install <strong>kmod-fs-ext3</strong> and <strong>kmod-fs-ext4</strong> then I can mount the partitions manually from the command line.</p><p>If I install <strong>block-mount</strong> then a new option - &quot;Mount Points&quot; - appears in the GUI, and I can configure and enable mount points for the USB hard disk. The options on this page appear to correspond to the <strong>uci show fstab</strong> entries and the contents of <strong>/overlay/etc/config/fstab</strong>.</p><p>If I execute <strong>/etc/init.d/fstab start</strong> manually then the mount points are configured as desired, and if I execute <strong>/etc/init.d/fstab stop</strong> manually then the mount points are reverted back to their defaults.</p><p>But if I reboot the router, the mount points do not automatically mount, even though fstab is enabled.</p><p>This might be a red herring, but it appears that fstab is set to priority 20 in rc.d, where usb is set to priority 39. Is the router attempting to mount the partitions before the USB subsystem has come online?</p><p>If I rename <strong>/overlay/etc/rc.d/S20fstab</strong> to <strong>S45fstab</strong> and reboot the router, the only noticeable effect is that fstab reverts to Disabled in the GUI. The partitions still fail to mount automatically. If I execute <strong>/overlay/etc/rc.d/S45fstab start</strong> then the partitions mount successfully.</p><p>And now I&#039;m lost. What am I missing? If the fstab service can be executed successfully by manual intervention, then why doesn&#039;t it work automatically?</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I&#039;ve made some progress. I&#039;ve worked out how to change the priority of the fstab script. It&#039;s not enough to rename S20fstab; the &quot;START=xx&quot; line in <strong>/overlay/etc/init.d/fstab</strong> also needs to be changed.</p><p>I&#039;ve changed START=20 to START=99, and renamed S45fstab to S99fstab. fstab appears at the bottom of the list in Startup.</p><p>But the mount points still don&#039;t mount automatically when rebooting the router.</p>									</div>

This will remove the existing <em>/etc/rc.d/S20fstab</em> file. Then, edit your <em>/etc/init.d/fstab</em> file as you wish and do a <em>/etc/init.d/fstab enable</em>. This will create a new <em>/etc/rc.d/S<strong>XX</strong>fstab</em> file where <strong>XX</strong> is the value of <strong>START</strong> in the <em>/etc/init.d/fstab</em> file.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>But the mount points still don&#039;t mount automatically when rebooting the router.</p></blockquote></div><p>I gathered you have <em>block-mount</em> package installed. If so, the external USB partition should be automatically mounted on /home directory of your router when it is plugged in. I just compiled and installed OpenWRT on my Netgear <a href="http://support.netgear.com/app/products/model/a_id/2598">WGT634U</a> device. When I plugged in a USB memory stick to its USB port, the partition on the USB memory stick automatically gets mounted on /home directory of my Netgear <a href="http://support.netgear.com/app/products/model/a_id/2598">WGT634U</a> device.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think I&#039;ve cracked it... maybe.</p><p>I removed <strong>block-mount</strong> and all the fstab config files, and reinstalled it so that it would have the original configuration file, and then set <strong>START</strong> to 99. The mount point <strong>/home</strong> was automatically configured in the GUI, which corresponds to your experience, but the partition <strong>still</strong> wasn&#039;t auto-mounting on reboot, even after making sure that <strong>option enabled</strong> was set to <strong>1</strong>.</p><p>So I went back and re-read the System Log for what felt like the hundredth time. And this time I saw something which had escaped me before:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Sep  5 17:24:54 junk user.debug kernel: usb-storage: waiting for device to settle before scanning

But in the log it appeared <em>after </em>the comment about letting the device settle and <em>before </em>the entry which enumerates exactly what hard disk is there.</p><p>So it got me thinking... maybe fstab was working all along, but the hard disk just took too long to come online.</p><p>I put the line <strong>sleep 20</strong> into the <strong>start()</strong> section of <strong>/overlay/etc/init.d/fstab</strong> and rebooted the router a few times. Each time the mount points were automatically mounted.</p><p>I&#039;ll give it a few more goes before I&#039;m satisfied but it looks like it was just a timing issue, and delaying the execution of the <strong>start()</strong> function in <strong>/etc/init.d/fstab</strong> seems to work.</p>									</div>
