					<p>I have an internet enabled device, with proxy capabilities built in, but it cannot include authentication.</p><p>To get around this, I want it to point it to a router which will then add the required authenticaion and forward anything onto the proxy sever.</p><p>The authentication required is just simple http, and I think that the username and password go into the Authentication request header.</p><p>Is this possible with iptables? Can the details be included in the prerouting or postrouting?</p><p>Or else is there some module which will do this?</p><p>Any suggestions are very welcome, thanks!</p>									</div>
