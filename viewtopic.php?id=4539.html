					<p>I have implemented a new routing protocol SSR (Scalable Source Routing) for the OpenWrt linux and standard linux. <br />The purpose to develop SSR protocol is to enable routing in large random networks with memory and message efficiency. The routers can find the right path to the destination in arbitrary network topologies, even with many churn, i.e. the start or crash of some routers inside the network.</p><p><a href="http://www.linyphi.net">www.linyphi.net</a> is the website for this project. You are welcome to have a test. (Of course, you have to have at least 2 machines.)<br />So build your network as you like. Once they are connected, the route can be found.</p><p>After installing Linyphi, the machine gets one or more IPv6 address, which should be used for the communication with other machine. In other words, the destination address should be IPv6, for example, type the IPv6 address of the &#039;web server&#039; in firefox, which should also have IPv6 addresses generated by linyphi program.&nbsp; If you have internet connection, you can also create a gateway to translate the Ipv4 packet from the internet to your linyphi net.</p><p>Any test and suggestion are appreciated. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
