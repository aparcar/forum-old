					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have an openwrt enabled router running coova chilli as captive portal. In my eth1(LAN) interface i have to provide my modem&#039;s IP address (192.168.1.1) as IPV4 gateway. Sometimes this address is different when i carry router from location 1 to location 2. At location 2 modem may be from different IP and may have an IP as 192.168.3.1.</p><p>I want my openwrt router to be self configured against these default gateway changes. So ideally what should happen is -</p><p>1. When router reboots, it should look for default internet gateway(dn&#039;t know how this can be done, right now i set manually)<br />2. Once gateway/modem IP is detected then router should automatically change it&#039;s LAN interface IPV4 gateway address (using shell script i can do this)</p><p>Right now, wifi router is configured as&nbsp; &nbsp;ISP ======&gt; Modem (192.168.1.1) =======&gt; Openwrt WiFi router (192.168.1.99)</p><p>thanks.<br />Sachin.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sachin0235</strong> on 2 Dec 2014, 20:08)</p>
