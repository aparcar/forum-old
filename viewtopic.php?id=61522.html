					<p>Hello,<br />I installed openWRT on my Linksys EA4500 (v. 1) using the stock Web-UI. I managed to get the openWRT Web-UI and then when starting to configure it the Web-UI accidently closed. Ever since then the only communication I&#039;m able to get with the router through a LAN port is 3 or 4 pings (and front lights flash rapidly) with TTL=64 and then “destination host unreachable&quot; again.</p><p>I tried to tftp (and atftp) the original stock FW but it keeps retrying and finally aborts.</p><p>I read the literature and followed it – I have a manually set ip; tried 100/10/Full/Half Duplex; PC connected directly to LAN port 1 or through a switch; tried Windows and Ubuntu.</p><p>Although it sounds as if the router is bricked, I do get some brief communication when pinging, and&nbsp; the port lights on the back are not lit unless I have a cable in one of them, which is not typical for a bricked router.</p><p>Am I missing something? Do you have any ideas?<br />Thank you.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mandewho</strong> on 15 Dec 2015, 00:02)</p>
