					<p>How do I connect a CH6640E cable modem from Kabel Deutschland in bridge mode with a TP-Link WR842N V2.3 openwrt router running Chaos Calmer? I connected the wan port of the openwrt-router with the lan1-port of the cable modem, but I don&#039;t get access to Internet. What do I have to do?</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Kabel Deutschland (a larger ISP in Germany) provides Internet connectivity through cable modems on standard cable television infrastructure. Thus a cable modem is provided by the provider. Without configuration change the DOCSIS-3 modem use DHCPv4 to provide IPv4 addresses (RFC 1918 addresses, NATed) and IPv6 SLAAC to hand out a /64 prefix. The later is the minimum which is required to fulfills the requirements. It do no allow me to group the network into routing areas (subnetting) - which is bad.</p><p>Kabel Deutschland provides a mode to switch the modem - and the infrastructure behind - into a so called bridge mode. The result is that a public IPv4 is replied for an DHCPv4 request but if you try DHCPv6 prefix delegation (DHCP-PD) I get an error that no IPv6 addresses are available</p></blockquote></div><p>- <a href="http://www.jauu.net/2015/03/03/complete-openwrt-guide/">http://www.jauu.net/2015/03/03/complete-openwrt-guide/</a></p>									</div>

					<p>by default your provider modem(Router) is in normal router mode.

					<p>@tristank: Some cable ISPs (charter for example) require you to power cycle the modem and the router (simultaneously) before delivering DHCP addresses to the router. Ex-Kabel Deutschland, now vodafone, might behave similarly. My best guess is that in the luci GUI the default protocol DHCP should be the correct one.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; @ckm &amp; @ Max: Vodafone uses PPPoE on its remaining DSL-lines, but I would be really amazed if they would use this on their DOCSIS plants (as that would be a sort of belt and suspender approach to user authentication); heck even Max&#039;s link seems to confirm that... (The link is to a question which PPPoE (username &amp; password) settings to use with vodafone with the response &quot;No settings required&quot;)</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>moeller0</strong> on 16 Jun 2016, 11:44)</p>

					<p>Thanks for all answers. It seems that powering the modem off and back on after a longer period of time has solved the issue. I also had to make sure that the only device connected to the modem was the router, because for some reason that MAC-Address is than whitelisted for use by Kabel Deutschland (Vodafone). There are no PPPoE credentials necessary.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tristank</strong> on 21 Jun 2016, 21:48)</p>
