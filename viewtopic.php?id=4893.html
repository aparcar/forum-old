					<p>Hi there,</p><p>I would like to know if its possible (and if so, could you point me in the right direction) to host multiple simultaneus PPPOE sessions on OpenWRT. I would like to play around with routing - ie. route certain ranges through a different account - but I first need to sort out the PPPOE Sessions.&nbsp; I have searched the forum, but have not found what I am looking for just yet.</p><br /><p>Your help is greatly appreciated.</p><p>SlayerBeast</p>									</div>

					<p>You should be able to do it if you setup separate vlans, one for each eth connection which goes to a pppoe device. I have two internet connections, one through cable and one through ADSL with pppoe. What I did is setup cable as wan, on the usual vlan1, and setup an additional port, vlan2, and configure wan2 as pppoe on vlan2. I think you should be able to do something similar if you setup more vlans and point each wan setup to a different vlan.</p>									</div>
