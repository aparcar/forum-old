					<p>With actual kamikaze trunk releases (~r12900) and both stable and trunk 0.9.4 madwifi branches I can&#039;t set fixed TX rate of Atheros wlan card in AP mode nighter using eg &#039;option rate 11M&#039; in /etc/conifg/wireless nor typing &#039;iwconfig ath0 rate 11M&#039;. It was possible with old kamikaze release (tested with r9644 madwifi r2978-20071127).<br />Using automatic sample rate estimators like eg. minstrel do not give good performance in my network (outdoor AP, ~20 wlan clients), so until I can&#039;t set fixed rate, new releases of kamikaze with many buxfixes are useless to me and I have to stick with old one...</p><p>Is this issue is related to madwifi or wireless tools version? or maybe some other things?</p><p>PLEASE HELP!<br />thanks</p>									</div>
