					<p>fq_codel is the basis of SQM scripts - it is DESIGNED to drop packets to help control latency and bufferbloat.

Dropping packets is natural for TCP, in fact the core of much of the bufferbloat issue is that network engineers considered packet drops so bad that they accepted insane levels of buffering (up to multiple seconds) to reduce packet loss to as little as possible. Now for your own network segment (basically up to and including your router/modem) you could try to make sure that there is always less traffic in the priority class than bandwidth allocated AND all your UDP senders are throttled to mot send their traffic in too bursty a fashion (in other words this will in all likelihood not be possible). Putting all UDP traffic in the relatively small priority class might easily overload this class, I believe that modern bit-torrent clients use UDP for their traffic, so maybe this is interfering. You might have a better chance if you can better define the properties of the packets you want to prioritize, like port number (ranges) and/or destination IP addresses. Or alternatively if &quot;if I saturate the WAN with lots of connections&quot; refers to bit torrent, maybe you could mark the bit torrent packets to live in the background class (and/or configure your bit torrent clients to be friendlier; please note that fq_codel will interfere with bit torrent&#039;s µTP which uses latency increase under load to detect competing traffic, with fq_codel the latency does not increase and µTP does not realize it should throttle itself...)</p><br /><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hmmm... I&#039;ll assume your iptables command is correct, and want to look further into your question:</p><p>- How do you know that your gaming packets are being dropped? What evidence do you see?<br />- What packet loss do you see when the line is unloaded/low traffic?<br />- What packet loss do you see when the line is heavily loaded (say, during a speed test - I like <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/speedtest)">www.dslreports.com/speedtest)</a><br />- Basics of your Internet connection: Cable/DSL/other? what up/download speeds? Router model &amp; OpenWrt firmware version? What are the SQM settings?</p>									</div>
