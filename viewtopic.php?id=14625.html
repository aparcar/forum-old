					<p>Well.. based on looking at tcpdump on both the wireless AP and the PS2 (as a client), it appears that the PS2 is attempting to do an ARP request on the router&#039;s address.&nbsp; The router appears to be attempting to send back the ARP response, but it doesn&#039;t appear in the tcpdump output running on the PS2.</p><p>Does anybody have any ideas on either what this actual problem is, or how I could potentially continue to attempt to debug this?</p>									</div>
