					<p>I would like to return my DSL3-2750B.T1 back to stock. I have tried following the guide as well as suggested methods via google. And I&#039;m coming up blank here....I have a linux machine. I have taken the original .bin format of my firmware and used this command</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dd if=DSL-2750B_original.bin bs=32 skip=1 of=DSL-2750B_noheader.trx</code></pre></div><p>This creates the trx file, I confirm the start of the header is missing. Now I go back into the Luci UI I go to system and flash operations. I go down the bottom where it says flash new firmware image and select the file DSL-2750B_noheader.trx. </p><p>I get this message <br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>The uploaded image does not contain a supported format. Make sure that you choose the generic image format for your platform.</p></blockquote></div><p>So I back and repeat the command but this time leaving as a bin. </p><p>Then I get this message again<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>The uploaded image file does not contain a supported format. Make sure that you choose the generic image format for your platform</code></pre></div><p>So then I tried just uploading the original unmodified .bin file. That uploads and I click verify and then it reboots and I&quot;m straight back into the Luci UI with Openwrt still installed!!</p><p>EDIT: What finally worked for me was to use TFTP it didn&#039;t work at first but resetting the router with a pin presented me with the firware upgrade screen on the second attempt it accepted my original firware and I am now back to stock. I&#039;m sure openwrt is useful I just could not for the life of me get wireless AP bridge mode to work. Each time I would go through the steps once the router rebooted it was back to openwrt default settings. I&#039;m not sure I can be bothered going through the effort now of trying again.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sch_bk</strong> on 12 Jan 2018, 13:08)</p>
