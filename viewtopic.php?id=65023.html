					<p>Hi Xotic750,</p><p>Thanks for your suggestion. I have no time to do this at the moment. This router has been around for a while and I am surprised its not supported. I was only looking at it as a low cost alternative to the WRT1200AC which I have running as a Social WiFi hotspot product supporting facebook and google+ logins for Free WiFi.</p><p>Thank you for your efforts.</p><p>kind regards</p><p>Peter</p>									</div>

					<p>n56u b1 support can be added as it&#039;s a MT7621S device and several similar boards are already supported, but it needs some knowledge about how to create profile and write a proper DTS file</p><p>also building openwrt for it will unlock 802.11AC support for this device.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stas2z</strong> on 23 May 2016, 11:52)</p>
