Open systems authentication permits any client to use the WAP as long as they know the SSID. Shared-key authentication uses the WEP key as a shared-key to be exchanged between the client and the WAP as a simple form of authentication. WEP must be enabled to use shared-key authentication. The both setting permits either or these methods to work. The default method in the Linksys WAP is â€œBothâ€. The authentication type is changed by going to the Advanced tab and then the wireless tab and selecting â€œShared Keyâ€ from the â€œAuthentication Typeâ€ drop down menu.</p></blockquote></div><p>Although the out-of-the-box WRT54G(S) have the configuration option for this, it seems there is no configuration option to set the authentication method with OpenWRT.</p>									</div>

					<p>shouldn&#039;t it be just a iwconfig command or may be wl if that is supported ? These thing seems to be either handled by the hardware or the closed source modules.</p>									</div>
