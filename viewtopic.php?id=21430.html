Due to some problems with b43 by the time 8.09.1 was released, the 8.09.1 distribution does _not_ include this driver. If you need wi-fi support with kernel 2.6 you should compile Kamikaze yourself from the latest svn.</p>									</div>

It means that you&#039;ll have to compile from source if you want to use 2.6 with wireless.</p><p>As for IPv6, it should work with 2.4, but if you need the latest features and mainline developments you will probably have to go with 2.6.</p>									</div>
