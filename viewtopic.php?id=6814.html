					<p>Hey All...</p><br /><p>I&#039;m compiling some code natively using the mipsel toolchain on my wrtsl54gs and whenever the object files are build and I get to the linking stage, I get errors about hci_inquiry etc not being present within the libbluetooth.so (cp libbluetooth.so.1.0.24 libbluetooth.so) library.</p><p>Also, the libbluetooth.so.1.0.24 file seems to have corrupted headers...?</p><br /><p>Any ideas?</p><br /><p>Cheers.</p><p>Paul</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>The &quot;Corrupted header size&quot; is a file result on a file that has been stripped with the utility sstrip available in the toolchain, it just strips the symbols differently from the classical strip program.</p><p>Regarding the undefined reference, try to recompile bluez-libs to see if we did not forget to activate your missing feature.</p>									</div>

					<p>Cheers bud, bluez compiles with suprisingly few hacks...</p><p>Compiled bluez-libs, bluez-utils and ussp-push freshly in a usb-stick native mipsel enviroment.&nbsp; the openobex i am using was cross compiled on a linux laptop and transferred across.</p><p>Ussp-push starts normally now but when set to the task of sending a file come back with;</p><p>Can&#039;t open tty: No such file or directory<br />Eoory while doing OBEX_HandleInput()<br />__obex_connect: error=-1<br />Unable to connect to the server<br />Error</p><br /><br /><br /><p>Hmm... also, rfcomm wont make connections either, saying hosts are down. Weird.&nbsp; &nbsp;Is it anything to do with the BT_RFCOMM_TTY setting mentioned in <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=1650">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=1650</a> ?</p><p>If so... how do i sort it? --&gt; RFCOMM worked to make a connection initially using a stock kernel and the prebuild bluez packages, so I&#039;m assuming this isnt a kernel rebuild flag... What is BT_RFCOMM_TTY ....?</p>									</div>

					<p>pabb: Seems like you haven&#039;t insmod some module. Check <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=5614">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=5614</a><br />and use hcitool for basic functionality testing.</p><p>Also combining native and cross compiled libraries seems me somewhat tricky.<br />I succeeded with openobex 1.2 and ussp-push 0.9 compiled in kamikaze brcm 2.4 buildroot (an outdated r3595, not buildroot-ng).<br />Before that I used openobex 1.0 and obex-push (originally from openobex-apps but not included in recent versions).<br />Bluez both stack and libs were from kamikaze buildroot.</p><p>If you&#039;re willing finish those packages, convert them to buildroot-ng and submit to openwrt I&#039;ll send you what I&#039;ve done.</p>									</div>
