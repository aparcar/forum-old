					<p>Hi<br />I have recently bought a Lan Turtle - a small device for pen testers that resembles a usb ethernet adapter. The device has two ends, USB that acts like ethernet adapter and network socket on the other end. I tried to bridge both ends so both the device and the client it is connected to will be served an address by DHCP. It works, my turtle gets 172.16.33.61 and my client 172.16.33.8. The next thing I was going to do is to configure the device to act like a VPN Gateway so my laptop at home has access to network it is connected to. This is where I struggle. This is my current setup: </p><p>network config:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-3r2HZpg7lYw/VxiYbXzr_5I/AAAAAAAAAQ4/GD1IvyJi60kkiXLn02dPnT7IxQm5fElpwCCo/s630-Ic42/network.png" alt="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-3r2HZpg7lYw/VxiYbXzr_5I/AAAAAAAAAQ4/GD1IvyJi60kkiXLn02dPnT7IxQm5fElpwCCo/s630-Ic42/network.png" /></span></p><p>ifconfig:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GZ09gMf1QWc/VxiYbRoIxkI/AAAAAAAAAQ0/ONgJfpyMayoPkQJWfapOGwr1jFExv1GhACCo/s683-Ic42/ifconfig.png" alt="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GZ09gMf1QWc/VxiYbRoIxkI/AAAAAAAAAQ0/ONgJfpyMayoPkQJWfapOGwr1jFExv1GhACCo/s683-Ic42/ifconfig.png" /></span></p><p>dhcp config:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-K3nMW7206Hg/VxiYbJ4izaI/AAAAAAAAAQs/FxpolqdoRNoBAPYvyIJ2dnNdkgtT0LAgQCCo/s631-Ic42/dhcp.png" alt="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-K3nMW7206Hg/VxiYbJ4izaI/AAAAAAAAAQs/FxpolqdoRNoBAPYvyIJ2dnNdkgtT0LAgQCCo/s631-Ic42/dhcp.png" /></span></p><p>VPN Server:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0Xq2dGqBPAc/VxiYbTg6ogI/AAAAAAAAAQ8/m6u1_6QjWTcBfWXs1i09wX0iAxEDnbO3QCCo/s720-Ic42/VPN%2BServer%2BSetup.png" alt="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0Xq2dGqBPAc/VxiYbTg6ogI/AAAAAAAAAQ8/m6u1_6QjWTcBfWXs1i09wX0iAxEDnbO3QCCo/s720-Ic42/VPN%2BServer%2BSetup.png" /></span></p><p>both my Turtle and Laptop at home connect to VPN server but from my laptop I can only ping the IP assigned to my turtle: 172.16.33.61, when I SSH to Turtle I can ping any computer on 172.16.33.0/20 network. I think the problem lies in firewall config. How should i configure it so the packets flow between networks? Is my network config ok? Any help would be much appreciated.</p><p>Best regards<br />kanalia</p>									</div>
