					<p>So,&nbsp; I know this will probably be an easy fix from someone here, but I am new to openwrt.</p><p>I have a tp-link TL-WR710N that I have setup with openvpn on it to use as my mobile &quot;client&quot;.&nbsp; My configuration connects with my server at home and I am able to tunnel to my local network.&nbsp; I am able to ping anything on the server side (workstations, servers, etc) and able to pull webpages of local servers if I manually type in IP&#039;s.&nbsp; I am trying to figure out why I cannot resolve any local dns entries.&nbsp; Google and external sites (like this one) show up correctly.&nbsp; I am even showing my IP of the external connection of my network at home.&nbsp; It&#039;s just like DNS is not forwarding for internal requests.&nbsp; I have lost my way and am looking for help.</p>									</div>

					<p>Doesn&#039;t that kind of defeat pushing the DNS servers list from the ovpn server?&nbsp; I have also changed the .lan to my internal FQDN and it makes all resolution impossible.&nbsp; Even google doesn&#039;t resolve.<br />I will have to try again tonight.&nbsp; Otherwise are there any other suggestions you can think of?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lostinignorance</strong> on 20 Nov 2014, 21:17)</p>
