					<p>Hi, for spotify users, &quot;spotify connect&quot; is really great because it works like a remote : your smartphone don&#039;t read the stream and send it to the audio device, it ask to the device directly to read a stream from spotify so you can switch off your smartphone it continue to play the playlist.</p><p>Recently I&#039;ve buyed a linux audio device with spotify connect available on it. In sources I find some traces of github repo.</p><p>So now it is possible to have spotify connect on raspberry (with volumio for example) and some Linux boards have successfully implement it with the help of code sources below.</p><p>So I think this is possible to implement it in openWRT, just missing a competent developer to do it&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>There are 3 repos about spotify connect on github :<br /><a href="https://github.com/sashahilton00/spotify-connect-resources">https://github.com/sashahilton00/spotif … -resources</a><br /><a href="https://github.com/Fornoth/spotify-connect-web">https://github.com/Fornoth/spotify-connect-web</a><br /><a href="https://github.com/badfortrains/spotcontrol">https://github.com/badfortrains/spotcontrol</a></p><p>How to install on raspberry here :<br /><a href="https://discourse.osmc.tv/t/howto-setup-a-spotify-connect-web-server-on-a-raspberry-pi-with-osmc/15818">https://discourse.osmc.tv/t/howto-setup … osmc/15818</a>...</p><p>It&#039;s not very complex.</p><p>May be with the same principle you can make it work on openwrt ?</p><p>Thanks to this great community !</p>									</div>
