					<p>Hi</p><p>I have recently built a trunk image. I ran into a problem with name resolution, it seems the system is setup to make AAAA requests before A requests.</p><br /><p>to test run this</p><p>tcpdump -pni &lt;your interface that dns queries go out of&gt; port 53 &amp;</p><p>ping -c 1 google.com</p><p>when I do this I see that a AAAA request is made first and then a A request &gt;</p><p>I know how to do this on a debian box inet6 in resolv.conf. but I am not sure how to set up ipv4 over ipv6.</p><p>Can somebody please try this on their machine, 2.6 7.09</p><p>Thanks</p><p>====</p><p>Posted this to the wrong group, reposting in kamikaze....</p><p>==== </p><p>I have done some checking out and uClibc&nbsp; has this statement from getaddrinfo.c, the records are tried in order</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>static struct gaih gaih[] =
{
#if __UCLIBC_HAS_IPV6__
    { PF_INET6, gaih_inet },

    { PF_INET, gaih_inet },
#if 0
    { PF_LOCAL, gaih_local },
#endif
    { PF_UNSPEC, NULL }
};</code></pre></div><p>Note thay uclibc is built with __UCLIBC_HAS_IPV6__, this is the order that dns enquiries are made when no protocol is requested.&nbsp; make a ipv6 request first and then a ipv4 request. This is not the way a x86/linux(glibc) system would do it, the default is to do the ipv4 first and then the ipv6 - set by a flag usually in resolv.conf</p>									</div>

					<p>from my experience, mostly with firefox, if my ipv6 tunnel is down, a web page will take a few seconds to timeout the ipv6 connection, and then fall back to ipv4. It was like this when my tunnel terminated at a linux router (computer), and an openwrt router. but yes, the ability to change this would be good.</p>									</div>
