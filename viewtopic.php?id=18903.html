					<p>I&#039;ve done some testing and 8.09 and trunk both support the Asus WL-330gE out of the box. It&#039;s YABD (Yet Another Broadcom Device), but a small one at that and so far as I can tell it&#039;s based on the WL-520gU sources. I&#039;ll have patches submitted for kmod-diag/netconfig and a wiki write-up soonish, so it can be &quot;officially&quot; supported. For now, look to this thread for any more info. I give you permission, flash away!</p><p>Quick facts:<br />&nbsp; * One ethernet port<br />&nbsp; * 240mhz, 4mb flash, 16mb RAM -- the same integrated chip as the Asus WL-520gU<br />&nbsp; * I have device detection, the reset button and the power LED working (releasing soon)<br />&nbsp; * The CFE failsafe boot mode works -- hold the reset button, the power LED flashes, tftp an image<br />&nbsp; * It&#039;s pretty cheap, I paid retail $40 CAD for it (after a mail-in rebate)</p><p>Here&#039;s how it looks next my keys for size comparison. It comes with the nifty little case, a USB power cord, a tiny Ethernet cable, and a regular power adapter (not shown).</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://priv.kupesoft.com/wl-330ge-with-keys.jpg" alt="http://priv.kupesoft.com/wl-330ge-with-keys.jpg" /></span></p><p>Any questions?

					<p>Hmm, I was very eager to put openwrt my WL-330gE that I have *attempted* it remotely. On my network, its IP address was 192.168.1.15 so I started a TFTP transfer to it. Then, to cause the device to reset (since I could not find a reset command to click on the web interface), I attempted to upload any firmware to it, and it said failed, but it restarted. Then I saw my TFTP transfer the over (I used openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx). However, after about an hour, I can&#039;t ping or telnet 192.168.1.15 or 192.168.1.1 (thought it might assume this ip address). I did an entire sweep of 192.168.1.0/24 but I did not see the device. Do you think its bricked, hung, needs-a-reset, working on another IP address, still upgrading? I wont be at this location to access the device for 2 weeks. From the people who have tried this do you have any advice? Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>harrisonmetz -- If you power it on holding the reset button and the thing flashes, I think you&#039;ll be okay.</p><p>There&#039;s a decal on the bottom of the router saying what IP address it uses, mine being 192.168.1.220. The stock firmware defaults to that and responds to a ping and tftpinf an image when in the bootloader failsafe mode.</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>									</div>

					<p>kupesoft -- When you flashed your WL-330gE, did you TFTP the image to 192.168.1.1 or to 192.168.1.x where x was the IP address that the device had in its NVRAM?
