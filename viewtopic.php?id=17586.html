Can I use the WRT350n or does it really matter which I use, so long as it&#039;s the correct folder?

					<p>can you tell me which wireless channels are available for 802.11n 5GHz mode? Are channels 100-140 included for Europe Outdoor use? I wonder if those 802.11n cards offer channels for selection which are only allowed for outdoor use. I want to add outdoor antennas and use the device for outdoor use.</p><p>You can look at it by typing &quot;iwlist [ETH-DEVICE] chan&quot;</p>									</div>

					<p>What I&#039;d like to do is just install a version that had the radio on automatically so I could SCP any modules or files like that in afterwards. But with a default radio off I guess there&#039;s not really much of an option for that.</p>									</div>
