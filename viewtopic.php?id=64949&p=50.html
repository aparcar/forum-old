					<p>Hello, </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve done a lot of reading of WRT threads and instructions...only to find out that many were long deprecated, or no longer required (ex: ipkg-opt &amp; optware package requirements to enable file sharing).

After flashing LEDE, it may not be possible to flash another image, factory or anything else, without a USB to TTL cable using the serial method. </p><p>-2 I do not see a link or file for the Release Notes for the latest version released; where did I not look that I should have looked, or can that be linked to on the davidc502sis.dynamic-dns info page, and/or included in the download files, like the RANGO_WARNING.txt? </p><p>-3 Coming from DD-WRT on the WRT3200ACM, is there a more direct process to flash LEDE, or is it just revert to stock first, throwing in as many 30-30-30&#039;s as I have the patience for?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ryanexec</strong> on 15 Mar 2017, 00:44)</p>
