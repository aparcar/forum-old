					<p>Hi Guys,</p><p>I know this is most likely a dnsmasq question, but since I am using kamikaze 7.06 on wrt54gl, I thought I ask here.&nbsp; I have configured my local network to be say &#039;mydomain.com&#039;.&nbsp; The public dns for mydomain.com points to my wan ip address.&nbsp; I have also configured the domain name mydomain.com to use a third party mail server.&nbsp; If I send an email to user@mydomain.com from any outside server, it all works correctly.&nbsp; However, if I try to send it from inside my local lan, I get a &quot;User Unknown&quot; bounce back.&nbsp; It looks like its using my gateway (wrt54gl)&nbsp; as my mail server.&nbsp; The question is, is there a way in dnsmasq or anywhere for that matter, where I can specify that my mail server is somemailserver.com so all emails from root go to my external mail server rather than my gateway?</p><p>If I was not clear on my issue/question, please let me know.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>William</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I found the answer.&nbsp; On dnsmasq.conf I just need to use the &#039;mx-host=&#039; option. </p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
