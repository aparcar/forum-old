					<p>Hey all,</p><p>I&#039;ve got bit of a long question that I&#039;ve been struggling with today. Hopefully some samba/openvpn expert here can spot the problem.</p><p>I&#039;ve split the wireless and wired bridge on my router to give out 192.168.10.x IP&#039;s to wired hosts and 192.168.20.x IP&#039;s to wireless hosts. After setting up the firewall to work with this setup, I realized that windows file sharing wouldn&#039;t work without the router as a WINS server. So I set that up and it worked fine. Wired and wireless hosts can see each other on the workgroup browser.</p><p>Now...I&#039;ve set up openvpn on the router as well. It&#039;s running in routing mode with certificates and handing out 192.168.30.x/30 IP&#039;s to hosts. The VPN works perfectly fine. The problems are with cross-vpn file sharing:</p><p>-&gt; Hosts in the wired/wireless subnets only see each other in the workgroup browser, not the hosts in the VPN.<br />-&gt; Hosts in the VPN subnet only see each other in the workgroup browser, not the wired/wireless hosts.<br />-&gt; Hosts in the VPN can access all directly hosts by name (i.e. \\computername) but hosts in the wired/wireless subnet can only access hosts in the VPN subnet by IP (i.e. \\192.168.30.6)</p><p>Firewalls are disabled on all hosts for testing purposes. All hosts have the same workgroup set. </p><p>/etc/openvpn/server.conf:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># network
