					<p>I have an <em>ASUS WL500G Premium v.2</em> which is running Kamikaze? (v. 10.). I do see some troublesome wiFi to Ethernet packet loss and high latency when running the 2.4 kernel. I&#039;m getting the impression that Attitude Adjustment (a 3.3 kernel) might run on this hw platform and that I might enjoy smoother software of this newer release.</p><p>I also have a <em>Linksys WRT-54G v. 6</em> which I think I can run at least Kamikaze (10.) which will probably be better than DD-WRT that&#039;s on there now -- <em>which is a minor disaster IMHO.</em></p><p>Do you think I&#039;d brick either of these devices testing Attitude Adjustment &amp; Kamikaze respectively?</p><br /><p>Thirdly, do you have any thoughts of loading B.A.T.M.A.N. on these? I&#039;m trying to have smooth client hand-offs in a high&nbsp; density WiFi client in a fairly small indoor area. I&#039;m getting the feeling that this MESH implementation would be along the lines of what I want. </p><p>Requirements:<br /><strong>a)</strong> 1-3 WiFi networks -- some with Crypto<br /><strong>b)</strong> multiple VLANs<br /><strong>c)</strong> WiFi to Ethernet Bridge</p><br /><p>(a lot of this is working now)</p><p>Thank you<br />Jim</p>									</div>

					<p>I loaded Attitude Adjustment yesterday... Color me impressed. </p><p>I can get the original radio/WiFi to work &amp; bridge but the other two WiFi networks don&#039;t manifest. Might be the compatibility issue with the 3.x kernel and the Broadcom WiFi hardware in the v.2 of the ASUS WL500G P v.2.</p>									</div>
