					<p>Hi,</p><p>I tried to download miniconda from continuum.io/content/conda-support-raspberry-pi-2-and-power8-le This is an ARM v7 version miniconda, but when I installed it on my Link-sys wrt 1200 ac which has an ARM v7 processor, I got an error &quot;not native linux libraries found&quot;. I searched through internet about installing conda on openwrt, but found nothing. Does anyone have an idea about what I should do and it is possible to install conda on wrt 1200 ac?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Tony</p>									</div>
