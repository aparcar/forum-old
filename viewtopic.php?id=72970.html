					<p>So I have a TP-Link WR1043ND v2 and I use it to share my android phones (Samsung Galaxy A3 2015) internet connection with usb tethering. My problem is that after a few hours of it working properly it has weird connectivity issues. I can access some websites while can&#039;t access others (for example: I can usually access Google, but can&#039;t access Quora). I have to reboot both the phone and the router for it to work again, so I don&#039;t know which&#039;s problem it is. It doesn&#039;t always take the same time for the problem to occur and I couldn&#039;t tie it to too many clients being connected. What could be the problem?</p>									</div>
