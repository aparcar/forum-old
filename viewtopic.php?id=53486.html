					<p>The busybox find replacement doesn&#039;t implement printf which turns out to dramatically reduce it&#039;s usefulness for scripting purposes. Many scripts seem to use that feature as it&#039;s a convenient way to get file size, modification date, etc about the file &quot;find&quot; finds. Unfortunately, &quot;find&quot; is not part of the gnu utilities either. I looked at what it would take lift that functionality from the gnu version and add the feature to the existing busy box version and it&#039;s just not practical given the code architecture is very different. </p><p>The gnu version seems to be a rather complex and convoluted huge hunk of code that doesn&#039;t appear easy to pare down. Perhaps that&#039;s why it hasn&#039;t been included. Has anyone got an alternative solution?</p><p>Cheers,<br />Ron</p>									</div>
