					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>just now I moved in a new apartment. The internet is connected via PPPoE. I got a TP-Link WR846N with original Chinese firmware <br />当前软件版本： &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />4.17.12 Build 110705 Rel.36821n<br />当前硬件版本： &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />WR846N 1.0 00000000</p><p>With this router I can get a download speed from about 3mb/s.<br />When I connect my WDR4310 with AA I only get a speed up to 500kb/s. I already checked the CPU load. There&#039;s almost no load.</p><p>I tried wifi and cable connection to both router. It doesn&#039;t make a difference so I think it shouldn&#039;t be related to my laptop.</p><p>In the WR846N I cannot set up a lot of items. <br />In the WDR4310 I already tried to decrease the MTU value (from 1500 to 1492 to 1460). It doesn&#039;t help.</p><p>Any ideas?</p><p>Thanks alot!</p><p>Georg</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>FuLgOrE</strong> on 28 Aug 2015, 09:58)</p>

					<p>Dear all,</p><p>today I tried it again.

The output of &quot;tc -d qdisc&quot; and &quot;tc -d class show dev wan&quot; (the interface name of the uplink interface) should reveal any leftover traffic shaping settings.</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>

					<p>Dear moeller0, </p><p>you were absolutely right. Some QoS-scripts were limiting my speed. Thank you very much for you idea!!</p><p>Georg</p>									</div>
