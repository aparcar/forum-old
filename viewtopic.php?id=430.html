					<p>Hi,</p><p>I tried to read the wiki but can&#039;t find it. I can change PACKAGES to control which package would be built but can&#039;t find where to specify what to include in the squashfs rootfs. For some of the packages(like dnsmasq, iptables) they do appear in it but I want to include dropbear without success.</p><p>I understand this may not be the design philosophy of openwrt(minimalist rootfs with writable jffs2 for additional stuff) but&nbsp; sometimes it is easier this way.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yup, I can hand copy those under *-ipk to root then make on the parent to have them packed into .bin.</p><p>However, I am wondering if there is a &#039;standard&#039; mechanism in the master Makefile such that I can specify which ipkg should also be &#039;installed&#039; in the process in addition to just building the ipkg file that is good for later &#039;install&#039;.</p><p>What puzzle me is, some package does go to root automatically, some don&#039;t even though the .ipkg was built in the same process.</p>									</div>

					<p>thanks for the hint. However, not all of the packages in the buildroot can be customized this way.</p><p>The reason is that many of them only has a *-ipk target in the .mk file which needs to be invoked with &quot;make packages&quot;.

					<p>Why don&#039;t you simply copy the binaries made by the*-ipk targets to the root-target directory using the customize target before building the images?</p><p>This way you can leave the makefiles untouched. Editing makefiles can cause conflicts someday I think. Not that I would not edit them myself. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> </p><p>Another hint: I recommend to add a preconfigure.mk file in buildroot/make/ to add preconfiguration targets as modifying makefiles, etc. for different targets. A good example would be to copy makefiles for a patched iproute2 sofware or to replace files as done in Blackvel&#039;s iptables-p2p howto: <a href="http://openwrt.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=56">http://openwrt.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=56</a></p><p>What u think?</p>									</div>
