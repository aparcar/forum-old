					<p>Hi,</p><p>Through my experimenting with OpenWRT ive done just about everything I can to break my DIR-825, but the one way to bring it back from the dead (assuming electronics are not stuffed) is to hold down the rest button while powering the unit on, and hold the reset button for about 30-45secs until the yellow power light stops flashing.</p><p>Then set your PC to 192.168.0.2 and point your browser to 192.168.1.1.</p><p>Fingers crossed <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" />)</p>									</div>

					<p>i agree with fyi - check your power output first - even the most bricked device should have some led&#039;s blinking.<br />you can also try attaching a serial console - but as long as not one led blinks, i doubt, it works</p><p>CAUTION: DONT DO THIS IF YOU ARE NOT DESPERATE<br />i rescued my totally bricked routers by resetting the flash chip. dont do this, if there is any other option left. i had bricked my devices more than once while overclocking the cpu - resulting in &quot;nothing works anymore&quot; - not even tftp or any reset-switch-tricks.<br />openwrt removed all documentation about this from the site, since an error can really -and finally- destroy your device.<br />this is how its done: <br />-open device<br />-identify flash chip (the chip that holds all data - firmware, nvram stuff, boot loader, etc)<br />-use google to find out how to reset it (usually a pin number is named)<br />-connect this pin to ground - caution, if you connect the wrong pin, you may destroy the device. thats why this should be used on a already hopeless bricked device only<br />-power on the device for 2 seconds while the pin is connected to ground<br />-power off the device, remove the shortcut<br />-now your device forgot EVERYTHING - including cpu overclocking, any firmware or settings - my devices just started a tftp on 192.168.1.1 and waited for a firmware. of course this behaviour can vary. maybe some devices dont wait for a tftp firmware, but are just bricked.</p><p>i repeat: this may revive some really bricked routers, but it also can destroy them</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mrii</strong> on 11 Sep 2010, 11:55)</p>

Unpluging and Repluging equals no status change, The led lights on the router are suppose to light up when a cable is pluged in, A little light on the back of a Switch, Laptop, PC is suppose to light, ip config shows nothing is pluged in, no ip address, it&#039;s dead as a door nail.</p><p>The unit is sealed and under warranty but only if I can prove it was purchased form a dlink authorized dealer, (which it wasn&#039;t, it was purchased used on ebay) The warenty is non transferable and is only valid the original purchaser.</p><p>Id like to fix it but I don&#039;t know it&#039;s history.
