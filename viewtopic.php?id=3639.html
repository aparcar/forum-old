					<p>hi <br />maybe my post is already answered but i can&#039;t find in this forum any solution for what i want to do.<br />I used an older version of openwrt and i could manage my vlan&#039;s verry easy with admcfg but when i try to install whiterussian rc4 the admcf is not working any more as i read to another post<br />so i figure that the only way is the nvram.<br />here is my problem i want my wrt54gs V2 work as a client to wireless network and also i want to create 4 vlan&#039;s and each vlan subnet must have 8 ip&#039;s (that means the useful ip&#039;s is 6). <br />here is an example from my old admcfg config</p><p>ifconfig vlan1 10.176.4.201 netmask 255.255.255.248 broadcast 10.176.4.207 up #port labeled port inet<br />ifconfig vlan0 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.1.255 up #port labeled port1<br />ifconfig vlan2 10.176.4.225 netmask 255.255.255.248 broadcast 10.176.4.231 up #port labeled port2<br />ifconfig vlan3 10.176.4.217 netmask 255.255.255.248 broadcast 10.176.4.223 up #port labeled port3<br />ifconfig vlan4 10.176.4.209 netmask 255.255.255.248 broadcast 10.176.4.215 up #port labeled port 4</p><p>ifconfig eth1 10.176.4.6 netmask 255.255.255.128 broadcast 10.176.4.127 up this is fro the wireless interface(eth1)</p><p>Also i want all vlan&#039;s communicate each other and with the wireless network.</p><p>Thanks for your time.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />ps:I try the nvram but i don&#039;t know exactly what do all the nvram commands also i&#039;am little confused with the br0 and how it wroks with the eth0 interface.<br />ps2: This image <a href="http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net/i/WRT54_sw1_internal_architecture.png">http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net/i/WRT54_s â€¦ ecture.png</a> is verry useful however there are some other things i don&#039;t understand.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Mastoras</strong> on 11 Dec 2005, 17:57)</p>
