					<p>OpenWrt its really confusing for newbies, there is no place in download area where it says this build do not include or include web interface (LuCi) <br />I did not have that problem cause I read a lot before installing OpenWrt, but thats not the case of a regular who bought a router and stock firmware sucks, now that you have Gargoyle you can go back and forth with sysupgrade file as long as you download from Barrier Breaker 14.07 /ar71xx/ <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ar71xx/generic/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_br â€¦ x/generic/</a> that inlcudes LuCi interface<br />there are 2 files for the same router, you must know which one<br />openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wdr4300-v1-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin<br />openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wdr4300-v1-il-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin<br />I dont know what <strong>il</strong> stands for, someone who know can clarify the difference.<br />And you can always go back to stock from the interface of the 2 Platforms. at the end OpenWrt its a better Binary</p>									</div>

					<p>The &#039;il&#039; version is only for routers originally sold in Israel.&nbsp; Everyone else should use the regular version.</p><p>Named release compiles include LuCI, the daily &#039;trunk&#039; version does not.&nbsp; There is generally no reason to use the trunk version on mature hardware like the 3500/3600/4300</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 6 Jun 2015, 03:16)</p>
