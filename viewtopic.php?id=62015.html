					<p>I ordered a WRT1900ACS which should arrive the next couple days and am looking for the procedure to backup and restore the factory image bit for bit.</p><p>There doesn&#039;t appear to be the possibility to simply read from and write to the flash memory via jtag and the wiki[1] only describes how to flash firmware with a working boot loader which is clearly insufficient to put my mind at ease.</p><p>For kwboot I found this page[2] by Chad McCue describing the steps he took to recover from a broken bootloader. I downloaded the mentioned tarball and the contained kwboot is from u-boot mainline. However, there is no mention where the contained kwb images come from. Built from u-boot mainline? Guess not as he gets back to a Marvel&gt;&gt; prompt. So must be some extract, but how to get it? The shipped bootloader apparently doesn&#039;t support tftp put.&nbsp; So some mainline build to extract the marvel build and then hex-edit the header to boot it over uart?</p><p>At this point there is so much guesswork that I&#039;m stuck. I&#039;d be grateful if someone could outline the proper procedure to achieve what I want. I ask upfront as it would be frustrating to have a new shiny toy and not being able to play with it.</p><p>Regards</p><p>[1] <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1900acs">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1900acs</a><br />[2] <a href="https://github.com/Chadster766/McWRT/wiki/WRT1900AC-corrupt-bootloader-recovery">https://github.com/Chadster766/McWRT/wi â€¦ r-recovery</a></p>									</div>
