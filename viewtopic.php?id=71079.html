					<p>It&#039;s fairly easy to compile openssl-1.1.0. However, 1.1.0 contains significant changes to the openssl API which breaks many, many packages that are dependent on openssl. I compiled it last year when it was first released but the API changes made it impossible to use without patching many packages. </p><p>If you want, I can post the Makefile I used to compile 1.1.0 for 15.05, but I recommend you don&#039;t even try.</p>									</div>
