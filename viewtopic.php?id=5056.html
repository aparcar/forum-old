					<p>Hello all. I am fairly new to OpenWRT and IPTables. I would like to say that I am very impressed with this firmware and am enjoying using it.</p><p>I have successfully setup my router and have edited /etc/firewall.user to forward the ports I want. The question I have is, is it possible to &quot;Stealth&quot; the ports that I have opened for forwarding? When I port scan my LAN from the WAN side, my forwarded ports show as open.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hmm, sorry if I sound stupid. I just ran an online port scan, and it led me to believe that I should be able to hide my open ports from a scan. Now, this seams resonable to me. If we can identify an ICMP packet and drop it, well a port scan must use a protocol as well. I don&#039;t see why we couldn&#039;t use an L7 filter to drop all packets matching the signature. Am I crazy here?</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, thank you for the replies. I was at <a href="https://www.grc.com/x/ne.dll?bh0bkyd2">https://www.grc.com/x/ne.dll?bh0bkyd2</a> and their web site was telling me that there is a way to stealth the port I have open for torrents, but they don&#039;t say how. I read up on port knocking, and I don&#039;t think it is what I am looking for. I am not too worried about it. My torrent server is in its own screened subnet, and I only have one port forwarded to it. I have ISA server protecting my internal LAN. grc.com was leading me to believe that I could hide my open ports from a port scan. I just thought that would be cool. Just one more step to annonaminity.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t want to venture too far off-topic so I&#039;ll just say this and be done with it.&nbsp; He has acquired a less-than-savory reputation over the years among security professionals.&nbsp; He is looked upon by noobs as someone who knows what he&#039;s talking about (not saying present company are noobs <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> ) but he makes a lot of mistakes and then backpedals and tries to worm his way out of them.&nbsp; He doesn&#039;t participate in any of the larger forums and communities dedicated to network security.&nbsp; To be succinct... Gibson is to Security as Sveasoft is to Ethics.</p>									</div>

					<p>I like the line that Boobot is going on. If it can&#039;t be done now, maybe in interesting add on at some point. And I like the Sveasoft analogy, that explains it all.</p>									</div>
