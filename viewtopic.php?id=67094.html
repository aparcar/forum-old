					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am experimenting a strange behaviour from sysupgrade. I have flashed a <br />ubiquiti nanostation m5 using the factory firmware downloaded from the <br />openwrt website (CC 15.05.01 kernel 3.18.23).</p><p>Then I have decide to build my own firmware from the latest 15.05.01 (kernel<br />3.18.36).</p><p>However when I try to flash the router with the sysupgrade image (using either<br />luci or the command line) it seems that some partition is not updated. In fact <br />after rebooting I still find the old image with kernel 3.18.23. No error is reported<br />during the sysupgrade flashing procedure.</p><p>Moreover even if I do not specify &quot;-n&quot; the configuration is NOT preserved. Could <br />this be a bug?</p><p>R.</p>									</div>

					<p>No, the problem is different. Flashing the nanostation with CC 15.05.01 downloaded from the openwrt web site worked without problems. The router boots and everything works fine. However if now I try to reflash it with another image the firmware is not updated.</p>									</div>

					<p>I had a similiar experience with my latest build, although I don&#039;t know if this is related to your problem. Sysupgrade must have gone somehow wrong, since I ended up with some files from my usb drive on root and root having permission problems. I solved it with flashing the orginal firmware back (from Linksys) and then flashing my custom openwrt build. Worked like a charm!</p><p>I know that doesn&#039;t explain any problem, but maybe it is a possible solution for you.</p>									</div>
