					<p>Hey all,</p><p>I&#039;m moving from White Russian to Kamikaze. Until now I&#039;ve been migrating scripts and the like but thought I&#039;d attempt to assimilate somewhat and begin using the web interface, which appears to have matured quite nicely.</p><p>I managed to do everything I needed through the web interface except for:</p><p> - OpenVPN <br /> - tap+/vpn access<br /> - Transparent Proxy<br /> - And surprisingly, MSS Clamping</p><p>It seems that when wanting to apply MSS clamping, you have to enable forwarding between two zones. Although this may seem logical (possibly), it contradicts the rules specified below it (lan forwarding -reject). Without MSS clamping my internet connection pretty much doesn&#039;t work. Needing to restrict what is forwarded from the LAN to the WAN means I can&#039;t enable MSS clamping. You wouldn&#039;t believe how confused this had me at first, I possibly screamed once or twice at the router <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I thought there may be an option per interface, much like the MASQ option but I couldn&#039;t find one.</p><p>Below is the remainder of my firewall.user. If anyone knows how to translate it to the webinterface or the uci config files, let me know <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Have to admit, pretty happy so far. Nice work on Kamikaze!</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#Defaults - LAN
