How hard is it to svn the source down, run a menuconfig, run a make, and come back in 45 minutes? There&#039;s a lot more flexibility making your own images anyway, and you&#039;re sure to be current.</p>									</div>

					<p>Alrighty then. After posting the 1st question about location of binaries, I googled around for subversion and apt-getted to my webserver, a slow K6-II machine with little free HD space. I&#039;d rather not be compiling on it, but other choices are worse, cygwin on Toshiba Libretto 233mhz. I&#039;m on vacation and normal debian PC is shutdown 1200miles away. I brought wgt634u and Libretto with me to monkey with. So, with ssh and a K6 500 I see if I can churn thru all the build dependencies and come up with a bin. So where did the openwrt-wgt634u-2.6 bins go? I&#039;ve searched, but no luck.</p>									</div>
