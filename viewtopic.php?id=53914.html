					<p>Hi, i am looking for a new router, to take the place of a now deceased WRT-54gs.</p><p>Since i&#039;ll have to buy a router anyway, i figured i want something i can play with.</p><p>C7 has AC connectivity, which is not gonna be the determinant factor here, i have nothing AC ready, anyway.</p><p>So we get to horsepower and driver support. It seems like the 4900 has better driver support, and the PPC processor is a beast, but this is a somewhat hard to find item in this parts of the world.</p><p>On the other hand, market is flooded with Archer C7, but driver support seems to be of concern. </p><p>What are your toughts about that?&nbsp; Is the 4900 that much more powerfull (Cpu-wise) to make sense over TP-link&#039;s flagship Archer C7?</p><p>Are the drivers expected to get better in the near future?</p>									</div>

					<p>I have both (c5 actually which is same hardware)</p><p>For WiFi speed and range advantage (even if you only have N clients) then Archer C7/C5.</p><p>For processing power for VPN or faster WAN to LAN (NAT) transferw then WDR4900 hands down.</p><p>P.S. the ath10k driver is stable at least on the CC trunk for me.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>farrukh</strong> on 10 Nov 2014, 21:00)</p>

					<p>I think the PPC routers are their own undoing, they are just too powerful and OpenWRT compatible. Too bad the latest dual core routers are not really OpenWRT usable.</p>									</div>
