					<p>I think i understand what&#039;s going on... when I tried to update the firmware with the original web interface (to the latest firmware on actiontec&#039;s site) something may have failed and now i&#039;m missing most of my filesystem...</p><p>actiontec sent me the recovery stuff, with 2 squashfs files. one 640kb another 2.5Mb</p><p>I think if i just &#039;flash&#039; the 2.5mb one in my data partition it may work...</p><p>anyway to do that only with a serial console?</p><p>i can also wget from the router.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>PSPBoot3.3 rev: 3.3.7.15

					<p>think this is going to the garbage bin... even if i can send data over a serial pipe somehow, there&#039;s no dd binary there.</p><p>the PSP seems to be in full there. and I noticed it enables network (although no clue how to get a IP address as everything online is for a newer version) is there any hope?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gcbwrt</strong> on 11 May 2012, 12:10)</p>

					<p>Hum, it was under my nose all the time.</p><p>pspboot provides adam ftp.</p><p>the issue was the IPA var. it was set to 192.168.0.1, and i didn&#039;t give it much tought because it was the very same value on the modem wiki page <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/actiontec/gt701d?rev=1300285479">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/actiontec/g … 1300285479</a></p><p>simply by &quot;setenv IPA 192.168.1.1&quot; and &quot;reboot&quot;, now i can access adam2 via ftp. And no, it wasn&#039;t routing issue or something. it simply didn&#039;t attached any IP otherwise... weird. right after reboot with that value, arp -l instantly showed the IP and the correct mac.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gcbwrt</strong> on 11 May 2012, 12:46)</p>
