					<p>Hello everyone, this is my first topic and message.</p><p>I&#039;ll introduce myself a bit, I&#039;m currently studying hardware hacking and more specifically I&#039;m working on a Netgear Arlo. I have desoldered the NAND and dumped it content with some hardware tool (HardSploit). After doing this properly I have putted back the chip but I&#039;ve done a terrible mistake : I&#039;ve used hot air blower without putting protective tape around and obviously I have lost one of the resistors around the chip... More precisely the R150.<br />I have plenty of resistors but I don&#039;t know its value !! If anyone out there holds&nbsp; a Netgear Arlo, could you please check its value and share it with me ?</p><p>Thanks a lot, really.</p>									</div>
