					<div class="quotebox"><cite>alirz wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Is there a way to backup the router including the opkg stuff I&#039;ve installed on it?</p></blockquote></div><p>I backup everything except the sp0.0 partition into&nbsp; a single file and then copy the file over to my workstation. It probably takes almost three minutes to run the backup script and only a few seconds to copy the data over to my&nbsp; computer.</p><p>I use a method that is on an inspirational (not religious) you-tube video about how to backup a WNDR3700 to the cloud. It took me awhile to get everything to work but it is not that hard to do. All the work is done by BB&#039;s dd which is capable of appending data from each mount point listed in the script. To restore the backup&nbsp; the command mtd is needed so one approach would to use a snapshot image restore to get things started and then use winscp to copy your backup to the /tmp directory of the router and finally run a script from there to install your backup image. I use putty and winscp to make life a bit easier. Also installing nano&nbsp; editor will be helpful unless you are a vi freak.</p><p>First, connect to the WRT1900ac with putty. The command cat /proc/mtd will give you all the information you need to create/edit your dd batch file. My latest working batch file is below.

					<p>@leitec</p><p>I stopped compiling when it complained about not finding &quot;armada-xp-mamba.dtb&quot; file. That&#039;s on my work PC at the office. I&#039;ll fire up another build tomorrow with kernel 3.19 to get the .dtb file, copy it across to the corresponding location in 4.0 compiler and carry on. I thought you might have it compiled already with wifi on. No worries, I&#039;ll continue tomorrow and come back should I need any more help or if everything works out ok, I&#039;ll post back with any modifications needed to finish image build.</p><p>nitroshift</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nitroshift</strong> on 24 Feb 2015, 22:17)</p>

					<p>Just copy mvebu/patches-3.19 to mvebu/patches-4.0 and get rid of the ones that don&#039;t apply. I think that&#039;s all I had to do.
