					<p>Hi All,</p><p>Just to let you know that I started today a Kickstarter campaign featuring a set of boards based on an OpenWRT and AR9331 SoC WiFi module, the <strong>Domino.IO</strong>:</p><p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/706167548/dominoio-an-open-hardware-wifi-platform-for-things">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/70 … for-things</a></p><p>More information also available at: <a href="http://domino.io/">http://domino.io/</a></p><p>I am posting here, as everything started with posts in this OpenWRT forum 3 years ago:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=36471">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=36471</a><br /><a href="http://squonk42.github.io/TL-WR703N/">http://squonk42.github.io/TL-WR703N/</a></p><p>The small size and capabilities of the TP-Link TL-WR703N router pushed me (and a lot of other persons too) to use this pocket router for enabling WiFi IoT projects.</p><p>1 year ago, I partnered with the nice people from GL Technology (manufacturer of the GL.iNet pocket router <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=47715">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=47715</a>) in order to deliver a set of boards that are both cheap, capable and expandable:</p><ul><li><p>The <strong>Domino Core</strong> is the core AR9331-based WiFi module at the heart of all the other boards. We want it cheap, so it is @ $10 for early birds, target price will depend on volumes, but will be kept as low as possible</p></li><li><p>The <strong>Domino Pi</strong> is a development board featuring a Domino Core module, a DC/DC power supply, an integrated USB &lt;=&gt; UART bridge and a printed PCB antenna</p></li><li><p>The <strong>Domino Qi Mini</strong> is also based on the Domino Core, but also features an ATMega32U4 MCU and is fully Arduino Yun compatible, although 1/2 price of the original one and crammed into a much smaller form factor</p></li><li><p>The <strong>Domino Qi</strong> is a base board adapter for the Domino Qi Mini, that transforms it into a full-sized Arduino board shield, so that you can re-use all your existing shields</p></li></ul><p>But besides these hardware boards, we also want to promote services for makers to help them transform their ideas into marketable products: it is not easy to approach Chinese manufacturers to industrialize a prototype board into a mass production one, not counting for part provisioning, assembly, quality control and shipping...</p><p>With this campaign, we would like to create such full life-cycle services for makers covering all these aspects at an affordable price.</p><p>Don&#039;t hesitate to comment on this and please spread the word around you!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Squonk</strong> on 14 Apr 2015, 12:17)</p>

					<p>Thanks for making this very interesting set of products available, Squonk. I somehow missed your first posting. I&#039;ve added my pledge, and hope to see you reach the &quot;stretch&quot; goal. This appears to address many issues which prior off-the-shelf openwrt-capable products have not (though GL-iNet has been a good step in this direction).&nbsp; </p><p>If I recall correctly from the long thread you linked to, the chip does not directly support I2C.

But this comes at the expense of other functionalities: there are only a few hardware peripherals beside it. This can be explained as any digital stuff added close to some sensitive RF design would almost certainly generate spurious and degrade the RF quality.</p><p>This is why Atheros chose to limit the number of digital peripherals to the bare minimum: SPI (but optimized for Flash memory access, not GP), UART, USB (but with clock derived from master clock, thus the USB issues with WiFi channel skipping...), I2S and Ethernet switch.</p><p>So no I2C or other fancy peripherals, even GPIOs are not 3-state!</p><p>But you can of course bit-bang I2C over GPIOs, even when they are not 3-state: the driver is changing pin direction instead of setting it high/low, in order to accommodate for other devices driving the bus at the same time. However, you are then somewhat limited by software speed, and won&#039;t reach fast I2C performance, unfortunately.</p>									</div>

					<p>The GL store doesn&#039;t have all the hardware described in the kickstarter page. Some questions:</p><p>1. Where can I find the Qi mini board and baseboard?</p><p>2.
