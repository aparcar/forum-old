					<p>Wireless newbie here…</p><p>I have a router (R1) with (4) vertical external antennas and an access point (AP2) with 4 vertical external antennas placed at ceiling height on the same wall to extend coverage to a couple of adjacent rooms. Literally all the antennas are lined up 10&#039; apart at the same height on the wall such that it&#039;s </p><p>l l l l - - - - - - - - - - l l l l </p><p>When I purchased the router + AP combo the vendor swore up and down the appliances wouldn&#039;t interfere with one another so long as one was operated on channel 36 and the other channel 165.</p><p>When appliance (R1 or AP2) transmits traffic with a single client (C1 or C2) it does so at 55MB/s. Sadly when both (R1 or AP2) pass/transmit WLAN traffic for 2 clients at the same time the achieved bandwidth drops to 5-10MB/s. To be clear C1 is connected to R1 and C2 is connected to AP2. The clients are just doing an iperf3 file transfer among themselves.</p><p>As soon as I placed R1 on the floor and out of line of site of AP2 (some boxes of stuff attenuating) the achieved transfer is 55MB/s like one would hope.</p><p>I don&#039;t have any reason to believe the vendor had a batch of units with bad band-pass filters causing spurious emissions outside of the spectral mask. When I check the FCC docs for the appliances, the FCC shows pass for &quot;frequency stability&quot; and &quot;spurious emissions&quot; at a 3M or 9&#039; test distance which is akin to my setup.</p><p><a href="https://fccid.io/Q87-WRT1900AC/Test-Report/Test-Report-NII-pdf-2205639.pdf">https://fccid.io/Q87-WRT1900AC/Test-Rep … 205639.pdf</a></p><p>Because of attenuation to necessary coverage areas I really do need to place these appliances on the same wall, near the ceiling no more than 10-14&#039; apart.</p><p>Is there a wireless principle I&#039;m unaware of that explains why R1 and AP2 are diminishing each other so greatly when transmitting at the same time even though the channels are &quot;supposed&quot; to be completely isolated???</p><p>Is placing a small strip of RF shielding fabric obstructing the line of site between the router and access point a feasible solution???</p><p>I think a strip of RF shielding fabric between them may look tacky but if that is the only solution I&#039;ll gladly do it. If that is a feasible solution does anyone here recommend a particular RF shielding fabric to buy???</p>									</div>
