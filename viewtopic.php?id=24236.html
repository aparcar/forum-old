					<p>I&#039;ve been researching the best way to add a USB 2.0 host controller (usb mod) to my MI424WR (ixp4xx).&nbsp; The MI424WR has a SPI bus and GPIO pins for SPI CLK, RxD, TxD and CS.&nbsp; So I thought the SPI bus would be a simple way to add the USB interface.</p><p>I found an IC to handle the USB host interface via SPI, the Vinculum (FTDI) VNC1L USB Host Controller:<br /><a href="http://www.vinculum.com/prd_vnc1l.html">http://www.vinculum.com/prd_vnc1l.html</a></p><p>Vinculum also provides ready to use modules (with pre-installed VDAP firmware) that utilize the VNC1L, such as the VDIP1, VDIP2 and VDRIVE2:<br /><a href="http://www.vinculum.com/prd_vdip1.html">http://www.vinculum.com/prd_vdip1.html</a><br /><a href="http://www.vinculum.com/prd_vdrive1.html">http://www.vinculum.com/prd_vdrive1.html</a></p><p>Here&#039;s the VDIP1 and VDRIVE2 datasheets:<br /><a href="http://www.vinculum.com/documents/datasheets/DS_VDIP1.pdf">http://www.vinculum.com/documents/datas … _VDIP1.pdf</a><br /><a href="http://www.vinculum.com/documents/datasheets/DS_VDRIVE2.pdf">http://www.vinculum.com/documents/datas … DRIVE2.pdf</a></p><p>Using one of these modules, I think I can simply connect to the SPI GPIO pins and be ready to go.&nbsp; Can anyone (with more knowledge and understanding of SPI and USB) confirm this will work?&nbsp; Has anyone tried this with OpenWrt?</p><p>Thanks,<br />LinkZ</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>LinkZ</strong> on 12 Apr 2010, 22:06)</p>

					<p>I read up some more on the FTDI VNC1L USB Host Controller.&nbsp; Even though it provides a USB 2.0 host, it is only full-speed (not high-speed) and therefore can only provide speeds of USB 1.1 (i.e. 12 Mb/s).</p><p>Another post in this forum (<a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=23308">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=23308</a>) describes a USB mod (USB 1.1 host controller) for the bcm4712 (WRT54G/GS).&nbsp; So I checked out the ixp425 (MI424WR) specifications and sure enough there is a built in USB 1.1. host controller (OHCI)... so this is definitely an option for adding a USB 1.1 host controller to the MI424WR.&nbsp; I just need to a find a datasheet listing the chip&#039;s pin-outs.</p><p>Here&#039;s a product brief for the Intel IPX425:<br /><a href="http://www.datasheetcatalog.org/datasheets/320/92710_DS.pdf">http://www.datasheetcatalog.org/datashe … 710_DS.pdf</a></p><p>Although, I&#039;d rather have USB 2.0 (EHCI) if possible.&nbsp; Does anyone know a USB 2.0 mod (high-speed) for the MI424WR?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>LinkZ</strong> on 13 Apr 2010, 20:36)</p>

					<p>I think others have had success adding USB 2.0 to the MI424WR via the PCI bus (see <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=19107)">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=19107)</a>.&nbsp; There are 3 PCI devices on the MI424WR: 1 mini-pci slot (intended for the wifi card) and 2 moca devices (on-board, no mini-pci slots) for the propriaritary (unsupported) coax interface used for fibre optic internet and TV (Verizon).&nbsp; I suppose a new PCI device could be added via a hardware mod (i.e. soldering it to the proper connections on the board)... but I have no idea how to do it.</p><p>Adding a USB 2.0 mini-pci card would be an option, but I don&#039;t want to give up my Atheros mini-pci wifi.&nbsp; So a mini-pci riser or extender may do the trick... but I can&#039;t find a suitable one anywhere (for a reasonable price).</p><p>So I would like to just add a USB 1.1 port (similar to the WRT54GS USB mod), as the IXP425 has an on-board USB host controller... but once again, I have no idea what the pin-outs are for the IXP425.&nbsp; I can&#039;t seem to find a suitable ICD or datasheet with this info.</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>I was mistaken in stating the IXP425 has a built-in USB 1.1 host controller... it only has a USB 1.1 device controller.&nbsp; So the only option for adding USB to the MI424WR would be via an external chip, such as a PCI device or a SPI device (as described above).&nbsp; The SPI option should be easiest, but only provides full-speed USB, whereas a PCI device could provide high-speed USB.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello, sorry to resurrect an ancient thread, but were you ever successful in adding the SPI USB host controller? I am currently looking into an unorthodox method of adding an HCI over SPI to an embedded linux system, and the only options than I am seeing are the vinculum chips and the MAX3421 SPI-usb hci, both of which don&#039;t seem to be directly supported by the linux kernel without a huge investment in time to code up a usb kernel module, and in the case of the vinculum chip, extra time to code its firmware. I was wondering if you had any advice, pointers, or even extra chips that I have missed that might have actual mainline kernel support?</p><p><a href="http://www.maximintegrated.com/datasheet/index.mvp/id/3639">http://www.maximintegrated.com/datashee … vp/id/3639</a></p>									</div>
