					<p>Hello all,</p><p>Currently running (2) WNDR3700&#039;s, one on the stock firmware and the other on DD-WRT.&nbsp; The one on DD-WRT is set to &quot;Client Bridge (routed)&quot;, and is bridging a wired network to the other AP on the 5GHz band.&nbsp; Both APs are on the same subnet, so all the wired clients can see eachother.&nbsp; Here&#039;s the current/desired topology:</p><p><a href="http://img137.imageshack.us/img137/3875/51154343.png">http://img137.imageshack.us/img137/3875/51154343.png</a></p><p>Can OpenWRT be configured to work the same way?&nbsp; I&#039;m having issues with the signal strength/range with DD-WRT, so I was hoping that OpenWRT could solve that.</p>									</div>

					<p>For client bridge to work in OpenWrt, you must create WDS link between the two ap&#039;s. I think you can install OpenWrt to the master ap to evaluate the result and compare it to DD-WRT.</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode">Client Mode Wireless - OpenWrt Wiki</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Given the diagram, it doesn’t even look like WDS is needed, because the second unit (labeled Client Bridge, .2) doesn’t need to act as an AP. It should be enough to put it into STA mode and have it associate with the first (labeled AP, .1). Be sure to disable dnsmasq on .2.</p>									</div>

					<p>BBQmyNUTZ,</p><p>I had the same problem with trying to Bridge a WNDR3700 with dd-wrt. Let&#039;s just say that the connection was inconsistent (some packet loss and routing issues).

I didn&#039;t get around to trying openwrt but from what I&#039;ve read setting up a client bridge on an atheros based chipset is no cake walk. This may present a better solution for you.
