					<p>Hello,</p><p>I would like to use curl &amp; libcurl with ssl certificats in a default path, but the option is not implemented in the OpenWrt opkg repository. I just need to add &quot;--with-ca-path=/usb/usr/lib/ssl \&quot; in the part &quot;CONFIGURE_ARGS&quot; of the Makefile then to recompile. But I fail to recompile...<br />I would like avoid to install the sdk, etc. So, maybe someone just can recompile the packet ( <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/packages/libs/curl">https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/packages/libs/curl</a> ) for me ? It&#039;s for the standard version ar71xx.</p><p>Because I&#039;m really newbie on OpenWrt (and very beginner in linux), maybe I don&#039;t understand something...</p><p>Thank you for reading.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hom&#039;</strong> on 4 Jul 2012, 17:29)</p>
