					<p>Something isn&#039;t right... you should have gobs of extra RAM (/tmp is RAM).&nbsp; What does <strong>df -h</strong> say?&nbsp; Post it here if you like.</p><p>If you&#039;re planning heavily on wireless, I&#039;d suggest Whiterussian but the docs are degrading badly.&nbsp; It&#039;s a very old 2.4 kernel.&nbsp; Proprietary Broadcom modules are needed but they work well on that unit.&nbsp; Whiterussian matches the vintage and flavor of of that unit (as well as almost all other 3rd-party firmware).</p><p>The current Kamikaze branch is just now catching up to older Broadcom hardware for wireless, which is not a top priority.&nbsp; It&#039;s a far more recent vintage of Linux (2.6 kernel) and makes use of open-source exclusively.&nbsp; There is an older Kamikaze 2.4 kernel but I would not consider it as good at wireless as Whiterussian *on this particular hardware*.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t need wireless, go Kamikaze and don&#039;t look back. :-)</p><p>But each has good/bad.&nbsp; I use Whiterussian for all my bread-and-butter stuff on old Linksys hardware which needs wireless g.&nbsp; But I have a big advantage... I don&#039;t need good documentation.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Bill_MI</strong> on 5 Apr 2009, 21:21)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the help but I got a new problem now.&nbsp; I attempted to TFTP the firmware to it.&nbsp; And it said transfer successful. But now all I can do is ping the router and tftp to it.&nbsp; No telnet no nothing.&nbsp; Is tftp lying to me? I tried TFTP a few more times with different firmware and the such and still nothing.&nbsp; BTW in my first post I copy pasted the wrong instructions.&nbsp; But i think you knew what i meant.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>thanks again</p>									</div>
