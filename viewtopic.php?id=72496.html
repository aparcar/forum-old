					<p>The script you have will overwrite each time it stops and then restarts.&nbsp; As long as the cat is active it will continue to append unless it is stopped.&nbsp; &nbsp;It will take something much more complex if you want each occurrence of data that appears on the serial port in its own file.</p>									</div>
