					<p>In general, their are 3 chipset brands of USB wifi dongle in market, atheros, ralink and realtek.

However, some good ralink/realtek dongles could perform well because well internal design and specific driver modification, in additional, have no txpower capped. </p><p>If you could find cheap atheros dongle you almost guarantee you get a work dongle.

					<p>@stas2z<br />Thank you very much for pointing me to this nice router. <a href="http://routerboard.com/RBSXT2nDr2">http://routerboard.com/RBSXT2nDr2</a><br />But according to the specs, this device uses 12 times more power than the gl-inet ar150.<br />And this makes really a huge difference if you need to run it 24/7/365 on solar.<br />@tomrev<br />I agree that most ralink/realtek hardware is crap. Not long term stable. I would have to drive 150 km to reset the counterpoint router...<br />The distance between my points is about 1 km. Both points about 50 m above sea level. Mostly water in between.</p><p>I have now already 2 x GL.iNet AR-150 WiFi Router on Chaos Calmer 15.05 to evaluate them.<br />These little router are very nice. Not just very power efficient, they have also 2 x Ethernet, 1 x USB 2.0, 1 x RS232 (3.3V) and a handful of unused GPIO pins for connecting lots of other stuff.<br />The max. power of 18 dBm (64mW) is not that much. But real world experience has shown that a good high gain, high directional antenna leads to better overall results than a high power transmitter.</p><p>This is the hardware that I have chosen (so far) for my project:</p><p>- GL.iNet AR-150 WiFi Router on Chaos Calmer 15.05<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;from <a href="http://www.gl-inet.com">www.gl-inet.com</a> or China <a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/item/GL-iNet-AR-150-150Mbps-OPENWRT-Firmware-Mini-Routers-Wi-Fi-Router-WiFi-Repeater-Booster-Extender/32464052719.htm">http://www.aliexpress.com/item/GL-iNet- … 052719.htm</a> (fast world wide delivery)<br />- Satellite dish 80-100 cm with a good quality WiFi feed. 23-25 dBm gain.

Every mA count. The voltage is not important.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The DC-DC converter care about that.&nbsp; td (in seconds) is the time that your application need power.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Vmax - Vmin (Vtotal) is the voltage difference between the max. charge voltage of your SCs array and the<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; min. voltage your DC-DC discharge circuit can convert to the working voltage of your application.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; So for my application: 91 mA for 16 hours (short winter day) with a usable voltage range of 1.747 volt (of 2.65V). <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 0.091 * 57600 / 1.747 = 3000 Farad per router. Best build as an array of 2 x 2 3000 Farad SCs<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The source is not decided. Be very careful with stuff from China if you not able to verify the specs of the SCs <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; (C, self-discharge and R).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You *need* also a fitting balancing/protecting board.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; And most important, two good DC-DC buck-up-down boards for charging and discharging the SCs.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I have not enough boards evaluated so far. So no recommendation from me.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; But to give you an idea what you have to look for:&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/item/XL2577-LM2596S-DC-DC-Step-Up-Down-Boost-Buck-Voltage-Power-Converter-Module/32585884748.html">http://www.aliexpress.com/item/XL2577-L … 84748.html</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>The important settings:<br />Router link Channel: 14.................Unused in my country.

					<p>@Wahroonga Farm<br />Thank you very much for your project documentation. Very nice. Do you have a PDF direct download link too ?<br />Good to know that you had success with AR9331 based hardware.<br />I have done my solar calculation homework.<br />I measured a power delivery of 17.69% of the nominal sun panel capacity at a cloudy, rainy, short NZ Far North winter day. Panel perfect aligned at true noon. But this is a exceptional good poly solar panel. I expect not more than 16% (day average) from a different one. And I get 1350 watt/m2 instead of the world average of 1000 watt/m2 here.<br />BTW. I discovered how to get solar power for $0.50 NZD/AUD per watt.<br />The Chinese solar cell producer sell solar cells (i.e. 4.3 watt / 0.5 volt) direct from the factory at AliEx.<br />If you are able to build your own solar panel from the cells, you are total flexible regarding to size, current and voltage. And you save a lot of money. I&#039;m evaluating some cells at the moment.</p><p>Used batteries are cheap, but I&#039;m really sick of all the fast degrading chemical power storage systems.<br />Super Capacitors have a lifetime of 1 mio. charge/discharge cycles. That&#039;s 2739 years of daily charge and discharge.<br />If you are interested, I will post the details of my Super Capacitors power storage system once its finished and tested.</p><p>The parabolic grid antennas you use are many times more expensive than the sat-dish/wifi feedhorn combination that I use. This German engineer has sat-dish feedhorns for 2.4 GHz (WiFi) and 2.1 GHz (3G/UMTS). The feedhorns can be used with any cheap sat dish. Offset or front feed. 40 cm or 2m. Have you seen his &quot;Stickblock&quot; sat-dish feedhorns for all kind of WiFi/Mobile USB sticks ? Ingenious!</p>									</div>

					<p>Helllo anarchy99,</p><p>thank you (and Wahroonga Farm) again for the very helpful information.<br />I have &quot;only&quot; a 1 MB/s Internet link to share, so the 11 MBit 802.11b is on purpose to stable the link (it improves the quality, tested).<br />Are you able to make a precise power usage measurement of your USB WiFi adapters ?<br />Can you recommend a source (online shop with international mailing) for the AWUS036NH and the AWUS036NHA ?<br />(were I get 100% original hardware)</p><p>Interest in a little WiFi_regulatory_hack howto to remove artificial limits ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>openwrt.n0t</strong> on 1 Nov 2016, 07:30)</p>

					<p>I manged a good link over 43km on 2.4G.<br /><strong>Thirst I need to tell you yagi antennas are not useful für Wifi links! Anyway they have not enough gain and not enough bandwidth.</strong><br />The best are grid antennas 20-30dBi. The wind blows through the grid in contrast of dish antennas.<br />For the link about 43km we use 24dBi Grid antennas and ubiquiti b2hp. Theoretical with this equipment the max range can be up to 100km. But in practice the noice, fresnel zone and earth bend reduce this. For this range you need big hills and nothing between.</p><p>At 5G there are 7dB extra loss, I dont know why. The antennas are smaller.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dnkru</strong> on 30 Jan 2017, 15:29)</p>

					<p>Are you using the TP-Link 24dB parabolic grid?&nbsp; I bought one, looks like a decent build quality for the price, but never tried it on the air yet.</p>									</div>
