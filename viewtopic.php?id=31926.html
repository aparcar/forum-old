					<p>Hi,<br />I have tested OpenWRT on few routers (Backfire 10.03.1) and it seams that OpenWRT uses different default config than most commercial routers do.</p><p>Correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but most wifi routers by default have bridge between LAN and WLAN ports, WAN port configures with DHCP and NAT setup between WAN and BRIDGE.</p><p>OpenWRT briges WAN and LAN ports, right? Not sure if WLAN is also bridged together...</p><p>How do I switch OpenWRT to have same functionality as it had with default firmware? (WAN port not bridget to any other port)</p><p>I tried using web UI and managed almost to make it work - I went to &quot;Interfaces&nbsp; / LAN&quot; and there clicked edit button, and removed check box from &quot;DISABLE DHCP&quot; so that DHCP gets enabled.</p><p>Connected upstream internet cable to wan port, and plugged my laptop to LAN and everything worked until I enabled wlan interface.</p><p>Any help is appreciated.</p><p>Cheers,<br />Valent.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, I found a bug, or maybe I just don&#039;t understand the OpenWRT web interface.</p><p>By default when I look at lan interface DHCP server is disabled in WebUI, but it works, because I get IP from OpenWRT.</p><p>BUT, if I change IP address from default 192.168.1.1 to lets say 10.10.1.1 then DHCP gets disabled until I uncheck that option.</p><p>Is this a bug or a feature? Should I report this bug?</p>									</div>
