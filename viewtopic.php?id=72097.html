					<p>My PC is wired connected to my router (running OpenWRT 15.05), it gets the following range to its IP: 192.168.1.x and my Android Phone connected trhough WiFi to this same router but he receives the 192.168.0.x range... I can&#039;t share files trough samba server (windows) to my Phone (I guess it&#039;s because they&#039;re in different network ranges) and I don&#039;t have much time to use the computer. How can I set WLAN network to be the same as LAN network? Or maybe use NAT to connect them (even if the devices are connected trough different networks)?</p><p>Please help, I&#039;ve made a lot of search and didn&#039;t find anything relevant...</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>By default they should be in the same network, lan.&nbsp; </p><p>On the network - interfaces page, you should have two networks wan and lan.&nbsp; Check the physical settings of each one.&nbsp; The wan should only be connected to your ISP.&nbsp; The lan should have both the ethernet ports and the wifi.</p><p>The most likely way for the problem you describe to occur is if one of the devices is actually going directly to the modem/router instead of the OpenWrt router.</p>									</div>
