					<p>Hi All,<br />I download the image ext4 combined and after decompressed I copied it on usb stick.<br />But after a regular boot I do not view any ethernet NIC&#039;s. The only interface I have with ifconfig is the local &quot;lo&quot;.<br />If I try it on VBox machine I view all ethernet interfaces.<br />I missed something??</p><p>Cheers</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, you missed kernel module for your nic type.<br />Because network is not available you need to manually place &quot;..kmod..ipk&quot; to usb stick partition and install it.</p>									</div>

					<p>im sure that x86 (32bit) binaries had all the necessary ethernet drivers on known motherboard manufacturers, realtek, intel, via, etc... the 64bit counterpart missing some drivers though, afaik, 64bit only had drivers in realtek and intel, preety much anything else are SOL and need to be installed or build you own using image builder.</p><p>to be honest, they should just include all the drivers from ethernet and wireless cards, since we actually had gigs of space available in x86 environment.</p>									</div>

Modules are preloaded unless manually removed from /etc/modules.d.<br />Not good to have every possible module always resident<br />But I agree - good to have all widespread nic modules such as intel and realtek. They are not so numerous. Also good to have latest drivers for realtek because r8169 always caused panics and restarts in some situations and they were unable to fix it for years. Happily it was recently fixed.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bolvan</strong> on 25 Mar 2016, 21:41)</p>
