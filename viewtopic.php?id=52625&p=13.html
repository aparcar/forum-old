Download the zip from the post #124 (which I quoted below) and follow the steps to flash it using TFTPd recovery method.

					<p>50147 is kind of build version. I think it increases with every change deveolopers make. But with this high number it&#039;s actually long story. The 50147 comes from old openwrt time. Openwrt nearly died, but lede continued as lede reboot, maybe from zero, but recently lede merged back into openwrt again and numbering stayed from lede reboot. So if you sysupgrade to openwrt snapshot (trunk), you will see number like 6 thousands, which is less, but more recent. The most notable difference is that there&#039;s no longer recipe for a drink ;-)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 9 Mar 2018, 12:31)</p>

Doing this during the developemnt is possible to test and check the firmware that you have compiled without flashing it (even with the stock firmware in the device, so it&#039;s completly safe). The INITRAMFS can be booted using the serial console and the TFTP server. In order to generate this other image: When execute the &quot;make menuconfig&quot; then select &quot;TARGET IMAGES&quot; ---&gt; and enable RAMDISK. Leave enabled &quot;SQUASHFS&quot; too.<br />- Share you user &quot;.config&quot; file in the release section (as this file is not added to the repo). With this will be more easy to recompile and help you.</p><p>I hope you agree!</p><p>In the other hand: I suggest to all people that checks any of these releases to write here the bugs they found. With this info will be more easy to solve troubles and create the PR required to add official support. When we have done the step of merge with the official repo, then we will receive increased support. Until this goal our efforts can be useless.</p><p>Regards!</p>									</div>

Congratulations! ;-)</p><p>I post here some comments:</p><p>- How to boot the INITRAMFS firmware?<br />&nbsp; 1) Boot your device using the SERIAL connection, and stop the U-boot with key &#039;4&#039;.<br />&nbsp; 2) Copy the firmware-initramfs to one TFTP server running in address 192.168.0.100.<br />&nbsp; 3) Type in the U-boot console: &quot;tftpboot 0x82000000 openwrt-ramips-mt7620-ArcherC2-initramfs-kernel.bin&quot;<br />&nbsp; 4) After END the TFTP download, type &quot;boot.m 0x82000000&quot;<br />&nbsp; Voilà! Your OpenWRT will boot in your device WITHOUT CHANGING ANYTHING IN THE FLASH.</p><p>- After booting OpenWRT I recommend to do a backup of your STOCK firmware:<br />&nbsp; 1) Connect using SSH to your device (change the IP using the SERIAL connection if you need it).<br />&nbsp; 2) Execute:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # mkdir /tmp/backup<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # cat /proc/mtd &gt; /tmp/backup/mtd.txt<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # dd if=/dev/mtd0ro of=/tmp/backup/mtd0ro.u-boot<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # dd if=/dev/mtd1ro of=/tmp/backup/mtd1ro.firmware<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # dd if=/dev/mtd2ro of=/tmp/backup/mtd2ro.kernel<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # dd if=/dev/mtd3ro of=/tmp/backup/mtd3ro.rootfs<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # dd if=/dev/mtd4ro of=/tmp/backup/mtd4ro.rootfs_data<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # dd if=/dev/mtd5ro of=/tmp/backup/mtd5ro.config<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # dd if=/dev/mtd6ro of=/tmp/backup/mtd6ro.rom<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # dd if=/dev/mtd7ro of=/tmp/backup/mtd7ro.romfile<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # dd if=/dev/mtd8ro of=/tmp/backup/mtd8ro.radio<br />&nbsp; 3) Using the SCP command copy these files to your computer and save them in a safe location.</p><p>- More or less, all seems to work with this firmware... except:<br />&nbsp; 1) The 5GHz radio seems to have troubles.<br />&nbsp; 2) In the booting process I see some problems.
