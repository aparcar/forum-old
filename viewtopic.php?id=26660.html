					<p>Hi</p><p>I have a rather big lan network with multiple ethernet switches in a building.<br />I would like to cover this large building with 2 or 3 WLANs on different SSIDs with a lot of access points.<br />Of course, each SSID must be connected to a single VLAN to enable roaming.<br />One of the SSID will be a public hotspot operated with a single coova chilli program.<br />The other SSID will be private.<br />The access points will be accton mr3201 routers with openwrt. They have an atheros chipset which support multiple SSID, but they have a single ethernet port.<br />If there is a single ethernet port, does this mean that the router have no hardware switch inside?<br />If I create networks like eth0.0, eth0.1, eth0.2, will the ethernet frames on the port be automatically VLAN tagged?<br />If there is an internal switch, do I have to configure it like this?<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#### VLAN configuration 
config switch eth0
    option vlan0    &quot;0t 5*&quot;
    option vlan1    &quot;0t 5*&quot;
    option vlan2    &quot;0t 5*&quot;</code></pre></div><p>0t should mean that port 0 must be tagged?</p><p>I don&#039;t know well how tagged frames are handled by SOHO ethernet switches. What does a standard ethernet switch do with tagged ethernet frames? are they forwarded as is to all other access points?</p><p>Can I bridge eth0 (untagged) to one ssid and eth0.1 (vlan1) to another ssid?</p><p>Thanks in advance for your answers</p>									</div>

					<p>The references I found to this device suggested it was most like a Fonera, and that has no switch inside it; you just configure the ethernet interface normally.&nbsp; Make sure the ethernet interface supports oversize frames, or reduce the MTU on the untagged networks.</p><p>Perhaps opening it up and taking some high-res pictures might help.</p><p>All the best,</p><p>Michael</p>									</div>
