					<p>Hello,</p><p>I know there are a lot of questions on which hardware to buy but even after having read some topics in this forum, I still can&#039;t figure out which one to choose.</p><p>I&#039;m looking for two piece of hardware, the first one is a wireless router. I just want a cheap one with good performances fitting well with OpenWrt. Some gigabit Ethernet ports up to 5 and let&#039;s say good wireless performances (see further). I will mainly use this router as a firewall, set up some VPNs and a small Web server not intended for high traffic.</p><p>My second wish is a wireless switch. In order to prevent pulling a cable between the router and my work place, I just want an hardware that will be able to join a wireless access provided by the router (no IP required, just level 2) and provide some gigabit Ethernet ports up to 10 will be great. OpenWrt is not required on that one but why not if available. The wireless connection might be some time under heavy charge so the router and the switch must ensure good performances at this point.</p><p>I&#039;ll be thankful for any advise.</p>									</div>

					<p>for your wireless if you need fat bw I&#039;ll suggest using 802.11ac adapters ( no linux support ) or <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300">tl-wdr43XX</a> with the dandy openwrt support. <br />for webserver I tried wr1043nd and WZR-HP-G300NH both using AR9132 cpu but couldn&#039;t get any satisfyin performance even for one client with php and mysql runnin on same box. it&#039;s too lazy.<br />maybe you get better performance on this new tp-link product due to it&#039;s higher cpu and ram.</p>									</div>
