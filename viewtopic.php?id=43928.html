					<p>I can only confirm, that switch of wr741nd is detected as 1000Mbs (dmesg: [&nbsp; &nbsp;32.780000] eth0: link up (1000Mbps/Full duplex)), but I never noticed problems with switch, just wifi bugs are troublesome. Tested now on barrier breaker r35062. I think I noticed that even with the &quot;latest&quot; BB (compiled about 10 days ago), it still detects as 1000Mbs, but I don&#039;t have the wr741 by hand now.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi all!<br />I have the same TP-Link TL-WR741ND (v1.4 AA12.09) router and I have the very same problem with the ethernet ports. It occurs randomly, no logic. When it shows up I have to turn wifi on on my phone and reenable port to the computer via the web-interface of router, no other way to fix that. Sadly, I did not copy the syslog in that moment but as I remember it seems on that contains in first message of that topic.</p><p>upd Found <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/13467">that</a>. No&nbsp; decision.</p><p>upd2 It comes up again.

I have an Intelbras WRN240, but it is an OEM tp-link wr743nd.<br />The first version of openwrt a had installed was 12.09 rc1, and a don&#039;t had any problem. But when a upgrade to version BB 14.07 the problem starts. I don&#039;t know why the wired connection stops. <br />Later I realize that&#039;s occurs when I start torrent client. SO I back to openwrt 12.09, but I used the final released this time. And the problem persist. After that, I tried to install the 12.09 RC1 again. and now the problem stop! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>That&#039;s it.
