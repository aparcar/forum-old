					<p>I have OpenWrt running on a raspberry pi 3 and need to be able to configure the IPv6 address lease options.</p><p>The main configuration options I&#039;m looking for are:<br />1) IPv6 Lease Type (Disabled / SLAAC + Stateless DHCPv6 / Stateful DHCPv6)<br />2) Lease Duration<br />3) LAN IPv6 Address<br />4) IPv6 Gateway Address</p><p>I have an old D-Link DIR-825 which has all of this configurability, and am looking to use the raspberry pi as a replacement if these options are configurable.</p><p>The <strong>Network-&gt;DHCP and DNS</strong> panel in OpenWrt&#039;s web interface doesn&#039;t have options like I need. Is there some other way that this functionality can be configured?</p>									</div>

It&#039;s starting to look like the configuration options we need are available to be configured by hand in config files, but apparently there&#039;s no way (yet) to do this conveniently via the web interface.</p>									</div>

					<p>That&#039;s unfortunate, since LuCI doesn&#039;t support all configuration on OpenWRT. Perhaps you may want to make a request to the LuCI devs.</p>									</div>
