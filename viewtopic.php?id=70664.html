					<p>Dear hackers,</p><p>I bricked my AWUS036H by spilling juice on it, now it runs but doesn&#039;t connect to any wireless network, be it at home or work or friend&#039;s house. it just sits there and shows list of networks .. but everytime I try &quot;unable to connect&quot;.</p><p>These cards are not available in our markets and to order one is a really a game of waiting for a long time for shipping. Also there&#039;s the risk of having a fake. So I have been looking for alternatives.</p><p>OpenWRT shows you can use Client bridge mode and client repeater mode but this would suggest you already have a router connected to the internet, so this is for home use only to extend the range.</p><p>What I want is to use any of these linux based firmwares to convert any supported router in our market to a wireless adapter which I can use with or KALI linux as a hacking card in monitor mode. [I do not want to install Kali on the router itself]<br />is it possible ?!!yes or no ? if so how ?!</p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>For example airserv-ng, part of aircrack-ng.&nbsp; I&#039;m not familiar with cracking tools other than aircrack but most of them likely have some similar &quot;remote&quot; or &quot;drone&quot; function.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 20 Apr 2017, 16:20)</p>

					<p>Yes, in theory.<br />Although there seems to be a bug, I get &quot;assertion failed&quot; error from airserv / network.c when I try this at home with the pre-built LEDE aircrack-ng package.&nbsp; It does work when I use a self-built aircrack-ng suite between two PCs.</p><p>Step by step would be:<br />Install OpenWrt and aircrack-ng on the router.&nbsp; (This will require a router with &gt;4 MB flash).<br />Create a monitor mode interface in /etc/config/wireless on the router<br />Run <strong>airserv-ng -d &lt;interface&gt;</strong> on the router<br />Run any aircrack program on the PC with &lt;router IP&gt;:666 as the device name.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 20 Apr 2017, 17:06)</p>
