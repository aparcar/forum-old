					<p>I bought into this mod, hook line and sinker:</p><p><a href="http://sodoityourself.com/max232-serial-level-converter/">http://sodoityourself.com/max232-serial â€¦ converter/</a></p><p>So I drove myself nuts getting the bits together. Bought enough bits from DIGI-KEY to build two boards. Cheap enuf i thought...($10), then a project board from radio shack, and some connectors laying around. </p><p>I knocked out the two boards, and proceeded to hook one of them to the WL500gpV1. Well in the finest tradition in engineering, it didn&#039;t work. Found I had one of the 1pf caps backwards, I reworked the board...nothing.&nbsp; </p><p>Found the issue by reading the datasheet for the max232n from TI.... It&#039;s a 5v chip, and I was using the 3.2vcc on J10.&nbsp; I moved the vcc for the max232 board over to where 5v was feeding one of the regulators and it started to work.</p><p>If I had to it all over again, I would have gotten this board:</p><p><a href="http://fcpcb.ecrater.com/product.php?pid=1750384">http://fcpcb.ecrater.com/product.php?pid=1750384</a></p><p>Because it uses the max3232 chip, which can use the 3.2v and It would have been quicker, cleaner and whole lot easier.</p>									</div>
