					<p>Hi.</p><p>According to <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start#edimax">table of hardware</a>, Edimax BR-6475nD is &quot;fully or reasonably&quot; supported by OpenWrt. There is also <a href="http://patchwork.openwrt.org/patch/3431/">a patch</a> that brings support for this device (though apparently it has never been imported). And, looking in downloads, it seems there are images missing for RT3662/RT3883 devices, either in <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09/ramips/rt3883/">AA</a> or <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ramips/">snapshots</a>.</p><p>So the question: is this device really supported? And if so, has anyone actually succeeded in running OpenWrt on it (or any other RT3662/RT3883 based device)?</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>PS: In case OpenWrt runs on this device, AFAICT it will also run on very similar BR-6675nD. Edimax firmwares for these two devices come from the same source code, and I&#039;m actually running v1.22 (which is for 6675) on 6475.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hm, no reply for almost two months? Then, IMHO, those Ralink based devices really should not be mentioned as &quot;reasonably supported&quot; in TOH.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry for necroposting.<br />But is 6475nd supported as of now? I see br-6475nd target in BB, but there&#039;s no explanation on how to flash it to the router.

					<p>the flashing steps for both openwrt and stock images are the same when done via tftp</p><p>to flash back stock image:<br />1. download stock image from edimax website (<a href="http://www.edimax.com/images/Image/Firmware/Wireless/Router/BR-6475nD/BR-6475ND_v1.17.zip">http://www.edimax.com/images/Image/Firm â€¦ _v1.17.zip</a>)<br />2. extract the bin file from this zip<br />3. turn off the router, press RESET and hold, then plug in the power cord and keep holding RESET<br />4.wait a couple of secs - the lights on router will tun orange<br />5. setup a static ip address on pc lan card - 192.168.1.10, netmask 255.255.255.0<br />6. plug in the lan cable into router and into pc<br />7. push stock image to router using tftp:</p><p>tftp -i 192.168.1.6 PUT BR-6475ND_v1.17.bin</p><p>after flashing is completed, router will restart with stock image on </p><p>you can use the same approach to test if newer snapshot of openwrt is working with this router. I tried about a dozen images - and none of them was working, so I stop trying.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bbogus</strong> on 5 Sep 2015, 09:19)</p>
