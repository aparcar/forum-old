					<p>I have tried a cheap local brand home router with &#039;Multicast&#039; feature.<br />It claims to do multicast forwarding and IGMP snoofing to restrict LAN flood. Just like Openwrt with igmpproxy does. (or rather supposes to do)</p><p>Unlike my Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH with OpenWrt Barrier Breaker r35828, it really prevents flooding while IPTV work absolutely fine. I have checked that with Winshark sniffing software.</p><p>BTW, Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH has RTL8366S for the switch.<br />&quot;For the increasing IP multicast application, the RTL8366S/SR supports IPv4<br />IGMPv1/v2/v3 and IPv6 MLDv1/v2 snooping.&quot; - from <a href="http://realtek.info/pdf/rtl8366s_8366sr_datasheet_vpre-1.4_20071022.pdf">http://realtek.info/pdf/rtl8366s_8366sr â€¦ 071022.pdf</a> </p><p>Multicast forwarding and IGMP snoofing are two different things although the apparent result seems identical. While your IPTV works fine, it may just mean that your router has only multicast packet forwarding function and still flooding your entire LAN with UDP packets. (You need to perform packet sniffing to confirm that)</p><p>igmpproxy just forwards multicast packets - like a dummy HUB - which default Openwrt does not do. By installing igmpproxy, you just enable the multicast forwarding achieved by flooding LAN, igmpproxy itself does not prevent LAN flooding. IGMP packet snoofing and preventing the LAN flood is handled by kernel. Since IGMP snoofing in Openwrt is a kernel feature, I guess everybody is just assuming it works. Information on this is really scarce.</p><p>Can anybody confirm whether IGMP snoofing works or not?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>test011</strong> on 4 Mar 2013, 19:43)</p>

VLAN method is proven way to do it, but if you need to connect to local network for example NAS from your IPTV box or from a smartphone to IPTV box, it won&#039;t do much good. We have here a Google TV + IPTV in one device, and some IPTV related service involving Smartphone and NFC tag, not sure how common it is, but VLAN is not very good path to go in this case. Maybe some complex routing table setting might do.</p><p>My ISP tells me that Buffalo is one brand that does not really do IGMP multicast support. Since they are inclined to use DD-WRT as their power tool for advanced user, IGMP is not really supported as other XX-wrt variant.</p><p>I am in a country where broadband connection is very common with over five million of IPTV users. I don&#039;t know how,whether it is done in switch or in CPU, but many cheap home routers sold here support IPTV, IGMP snoofing and multicast without flooding. I am using a $25 router, made in China with local brand name ipTime. I had rang the company and they told me that all of their routers less than 2 years old have IGMP multicast support without flooding and those 3-4 years old routers only have IGMP multicast with flooding. I could kind of confirm that since I own 5 routers of theirs. It is rather common feature here by demand.</p><p>I do agree that&nbsp; it is a matter of open source swtich driver lacking such feature and those home router companis may have something better to work on. As long as the versatility of OpenWrt is concerned, this may be critical in the future. There are about 50 million IPTV users world-wide who have better alternative than OpenWRT.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>test011</strong> on 10 Mar 2013, 18:21)</p>

Even if bandwidth is not a problem, all those devices wastes CPU process time ignoring the packets. When you change channels on IPTV, UDP connections/streams may temporarily multiply and again delivered to every device, creating a similar situation as DDOS attack.
