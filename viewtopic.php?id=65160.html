					<p>the ea4500 may fail to reboot after a firmware flash when it gets too warm.&nbsp; let it cool down first before rebooting.&nbsp; i made it practice of placing a fan blowing air into it during flashing to ensure it properly reboots following a flash.&nbsp; the current trunk r49377 for the ea4500/e4200v2 is rock solid.&nbsp; reset button works for this router but router has to stay cool.</p>									</div>
