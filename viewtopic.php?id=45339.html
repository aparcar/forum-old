					<p>After a bit of thinking, I decided to ask, before not too late.<br />Is this version the same hardware as all other 8.x and supported by 12.09?<br />Cannot find any post, describing chips inside or pictures of the router. What<br />firmware should I download for this?<br />I would also like to hear about experience users have, getting 841, compared<br />to 740n or alike.<br />Best regards all.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>i have TP-Link WR841n v8.3 and now i am running 12.09 rc1. According to table <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start#tp-link">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start#tp-link</a> only rc1 is still supported. I also use wpa_supplicant to ride and it is ok.</p><p>I think changes from v3 to v4 aren&#039;t relevant.</p><p>Regards..</p><p>Edit: from same table (bellow) support of main 12.09 is in progress.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Almer</strong> on 27 Jul 2013, 13:06)</p>

					<p>Why do you use rc1?<br />I assume tables of hardware support might not be up to date. People<br />report success with 12.09. Guy who tried that out could be out of time<br />to go further.<br />I use wpa_supplicant on freebsd laptop to connect to the router. I pressume<br />you have this router behind another one as a bridge?<br />Thank you for answering and all the best.</p>									</div>
