					<p>Hi,<br />I did something stupid today. Because my TP-Link TL-WR841ND v8.1 was still running an old rc1 I reflashed the image with a more recent openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr841n-v8-squashfs-factory.bin, which worked without problems.</p><p>Then I wanted to configure it as a repeater and deleted all previous interfaces. Thought I configure the new myself... You see the misstake <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> ? As soon as I deleted the lan-interface (which was the last one) the router was not accessible anymore. So I tried to get into failsafemode but I can&#039;t connect to it. I followed these instructions: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd#failsafe.mode">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl- â€¦ lsafe.mode</a> . I get the system-led to blink rapidly but I can&#039;t telnet to the router.</p><p>I put the lan-cabel to port 1 on the router and on my pc. Then I configured my pc like this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>% sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager.service
% sudo ifconfig eth0                         
eth0: flags=4098&lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST&gt;  mtu 1500
        ether 00:1b:24:94:67:9e  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 11343  bytes 4258887 (4.0 MiB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 13842  bytes 5206913 (4.9 MiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
% sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.2  netmask 255.255.255.0
% sudo ifconfig eth0                                   
eth0: flags=4099&lt;UP,BROADCAST,MULTICAST&gt;  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.1.2  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.1.255
        ether 00:1b:24:94:67:9e  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 11343  bytes 4258887 (4.0 MiB)

        TX packets 13842  bytes 5206913 (4.9 MiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0</code></pre></div><p>Then I power off and on the router, wait for the system-led to blink, press the button and the system-led starts to blink more fast, which should indicate failsafe-boot. ifconfig now shows RUNNING next to eth0 but I can&#039;t connect to or even ping the router:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>% sudo ifconfig eth0
