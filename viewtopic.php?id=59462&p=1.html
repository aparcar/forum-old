					<p>Can you please list the appliances? Also, how big is the box? I don&#039;t know how much it will cost to ship using UPS ground to my address in GA 30047. However, I know USPS has some flat rate boxes ranging from small (8-5/8&quot; x 5-3/8&quot; x 1-5/8&quot;) under $6, medium (13-5/8&quot; x 11-7/8&quot; x 3-3/8&quot; or 11&quot; x 8-1/2&quot; x 5-1/2&quot;) under $13, or large (23-11/16&quot; x 11-3/4&quot; x 3&quot; or 12&quot; x 12&quot; x 5-1/2&quot;) under $18.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have a friend who is interested in this. However, after looking at the UPS estimated shipping cost of US $50+, it looks kind of on a heavy side.</p><p>Since you mentioned the device dimension is about 10&quot; x 6.5&quot; x 1.5&quot;, do you think you can try to fit 4 units into the USPS medium flat rate boxes (13-5/8&quot; x 11-7/8&quot; x 3-3/8&quot;) -- side-by-side and stacking. The shipping cost for this box is under $13 and we probably can pay it here for a local pick up from your location.</p>									</div>
