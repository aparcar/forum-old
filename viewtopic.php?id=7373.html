					<p>Hello,</p><p>I succesfully run openwrt on an Asus WL-HDD. Just like the NSLU2&#039;s I have, I made this openwrt&#039;ed AP run it&#039;s root filesystem from the harddisk. mostly used this instruction:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Asus/WL-HDD?highlight=%28wl-hdd%29">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har … 8wl-hdd%29</a></p><p>i removed all reference to ppp to make space. installed samba, vsftpd, ef2progs, fdisk, nas, wl and some usb modules. this way my wl-hdd had the most important functionality. as suggested, i changed the wan_proto to none... but had to include</p><p>after&nbsp; &nbsp; ifup lan<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; ifconfig eth1 up</p><p>in the /etc/init.d/S40network file to make my local LAN interface to operate. then i changed the disk layout to make it work with samba. the root filesystem is the first partition (ext3, 200 mb), the second is a swap partition of about 64 mb and the last is a extended partition of the remainder of the disk (ext3). my fstab looks like:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;/dev/discs/disc0/part5&nbsp; /storage&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ext3&nbsp; &nbsp; defaults&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 0<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;/dev/discs/disc0/part1&nbsp; /mnt&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ext3&nbsp; &nbsp; defaults&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 0</p><p> at first i was not running it from the first partition since it was just an idea... i wanted to try running applications from the harddisk. i was able to use LD_LIBRARY_PATH=&quot;/mnt/lib&#039; and start some binaries from the root filesystem... but then i found this information on the internet:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://wl500g.dyndns.org/">http://wl500g.dyndns.org</a>/<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/UsbStorageHowto#head-4d459de735f85dda1449558f134e95a50d94382a">http://wiki.openwrt.org/UsbStorageHowto … a50d94382a</a></p><p>i first made a backup using &#039;dd if=/dev/mtdblock/1 of=/storage/backup/firmware.trx&#039;. <br/>so removed the original /sbin/init and replaced it with the file below. copy the contents of / to my /root... i tried it out with this file once before reoot and it seemed to work.</p><p>#!/bin/sh</p><p># change nvram variable &#039;boot_dev&#039; to your root filesystem<br/>boot_dev=`nvram get boot_dev`</p><p># install needed modules for usb and the ext3 filesystem<br/># **NOTE** for usb2.0 replace &quot;uhci&quot; with &quot;ehci-hcd&quot;<br/># **NOTE** for ohci chipsets replace &quot;uhci&quot; with &quot;usb-ohci&quot;<br/>#for module in usbcore uhci scsi_mod sd_mod usb-storage jbd ext3; do {</p><p># install modules needed for ide and the ext3 filesystem<br/>for module in ide-core pdc202xx_old ide-detect ide-disk jbd ext3; do {<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; insmod $module<br/>}; done</p><p># this may need to be higher if your disk is slow to initialize<br/>sleep 4s</p><p># mount the root filesystem<br/>mount &quot;$boot_dev&quot; /mnt</p><p># if everything looks ok, do the pivot root<br/>[ -x /mnt/sbin/init ] &amp;&amp; {<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mount -o move /proc /mnt/proc &amp;&amp; \<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pivot_root /mnt /mnt/mnt &amp;&amp; {<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mount -o move /mnt/dev /dev<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mount -o move /mnt/tmp /tmp<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mount -o move /mnt/jffs2 /jffs2 2&gt;&amp;-<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mount -o move /mnt/sys /sys 2&gt;&amp;-<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br/>}</p><p># finally, run the real init<br/>exec /bin/busybox init</p><br/><p>voila. and now i have a 200 mb root filesystem... already installed a lot of handy tools. but the only thing i wonder about; why is optware not ported??? dd-wrt has its own port, oleg and more... but no openwrt. Or did i look in the wrong place???</p><p>i hope this is also helpful to other people. At least I have a very handy small AP with WDS functionality that works fine with my WRT54GL&#039;s (running OpenWRT and DD-WRT v23 sp2). Just hope optware will be available soon.</p><br/><p>Gerard</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gbraad</strong> on 18 Sep 2006, 00:32)</p>
