					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have Linksys WRT54GL v.1.1. I&#039;ve tried many firmwares (DDWRT, OpenWRT-Kamikaze-8.09,Tomato) except the original one (I like extra features) <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> I&#039;m experiencing a problems with wireless bandwidth decreasing in the time. I mean that after router is starting, wireless performance is OK and I can reach normally ~20 megabits/s. But this is until I decide to download one file from torrent (in about 500MB is enough) or watch video broadcast which require only 2.5 megabits/sec. For example I start the video broadcast, and I can watch without any interruption about 5 minutes. After this is not possible to reach enough bandwidth to watch it without interruption. After router restart I can watch again only 5 - 10 minutes and so on ...</p><p>I&#039;ve made a test to use one day ethernet cable with the same firmware Kamikaze 8.09. There was no such problems. Does anyone knows what could be the reason of this? I&#039;m not using frame burst, I have only one station and I&#039;m using unique wireless channel in home environment in the same room with direct view to the router? I noticed that with the frame burst feature the result is better by the way. And I installed Tomato firmware just few days ago and so far the wireless performance is better comparing to others but still it&#039;s good idea to restart the router at least once per day!</p><p>Any suggestions will be highly appreciated. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> Thank you!</p><p>Regards,<br />Martin</p>									</div>
