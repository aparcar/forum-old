					<p>Hey guys,</p><p>I just acquired a TP-Link TL-WDR 3600, and I&#039; d like to put OpenWRT on it.&nbsp; However, I have seen a few reports saying that WiFi may not work after the install, and a few other reports saying that it does work.&nbsp; So now I am curious: does anyone have this router, and does its WiFi work OK with OpenWRT?</p><p>BTW, I saw that the OpenWRT wiki entry for the router mentions a &quot;wifi patch&quot;, but I could not find any references to it.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>I got a TL-WDR3600 a few weeks ago and 2 days ago I flashed Openwrt AA 12.09.1 (r41803 built from source) on it.</p><p>Before Openwrt I was using the stock firmware. Stock is really cool, it supports the &quot;hardware NAT&quot; feature on the switch (not big deal unless you have more than 300mbps internet), works as NAS, includes a media server and it also supports printing and scanning but only with compatible printers (mine isn&#039;t on the list).</p><p>My printer not being supported and the fact that I want custom DNS stuff and OpenVpn is what made me decide to flash openwrt in it. I can live without hardware NAT, by the time 300mbps+ internet service becomes available at affordable prices down here we&#039;ll probably have developed telepathy and a collective mind already.</p><p>I&#039;m only using 2.4Ghz wifi because I have only 2 devices that support 5Ghz and one of them is most of the time powered off, but I did test 5Ghz a little bit and didn&#039;t notice anything weird.</p><p>So far it&#039;s been working alright but since I&#039;ve been only running Openwrt for a few days and booting it a lot to test different wifi settings and stuff I can&#039;t tell you how stable it will be on the long run.</p><p>The 12.09 image on the downloads page doesn&#039;t seem to have the &quot;wifi patch&quot; my v1.5 needs according to the supported versions list here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr3600#supported.versions">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl- … d.versions</a><br />That&#039;s why I compiled it myself, which is not hard to do, it was pretty easy and fun (experience compiling linux kernels helps a lot).</p><p>It also looks like BB 14.07 is close to be released (RC3 was uploaded this week) so I&#039;ll wait for 14.07 final before I start messing with the USB ports and my plans to connect printer/scanner and HDD to this little monster.</p><p>Overall I&#039;m satisfied with Openwrt on my WDR3600.</p><p>Cheers.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fgimenez</strong> on 15 Aug 2014, 02:33)</p>

					<p>i think you should stick with a stock firmware for a while,&nbsp; i really didn&#039;t like the openwrt performance on my TL-WDR3600, first it seemed ok but after a while i noticed a lot of connection problems when playing multiplayer games and streaming video over 2.4g was slow and choppy... it&#039;s all working a lot better with my &quot;WD My Net n750&quot;/stock firmware, even though the wd n750 has almost the same hardware as the TL-WDR3600</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>winbond</strong> on 15 Aug 2014, 03:45)</p>

					<p>i haven&#039;t tried the TL-WDR3600 with a stock firmware tho because i don&#039;t want to flash back from openwrt, ill wait a few months then update openwrt on it and put it back in service if things improve</p>									</div>

					<p>Wifi is not enabled by default in OpenWrt, which is the only reason I can think of why it wouldn&#039;t work. All you have to do is turn it on. Very stable, especially on Barrier Breaker. Maybe wait for Barrier Breaker 14.07 final in the next few weeks.</p><p>not sure why winbond was having problems (maybe an old version), but my wdr3600 and my wd n750 both run great on openwrt, including games, streaming, etc. Much better than stock for sure.</p>									</div>

					<p>@winbond which OpenWRT version did you install?<br />If it&#039;s the AA 12.09 in the downloads page keep in mind it may not have the &quot;wifi patch&quot;mentioned here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr3600#supported.versions">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl- … d.versions</a></p><p>Quoted from r39392 (note: wdr3600 and wdr4300 are pretty much the same):<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Message:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ar71xx: fix bad RX sensitivity on newer TL-WDR4300 boards</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; On recent TL-WDR4300 boards the external LNAs of the 2.4GHz<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; interface are connected to GPIO lines. Because these GPIO<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; lines are disabled by default, the RX sensitivity of the<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; device is quite bad.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Setup the GPIOs of the external LNAs to fix the issue.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Signed-off-by: Gabor Juhos &lt;juhosg@…&gt;</p></blockquote></div><p>That is why I compiled my own firmware from source.<br />The BB release candidate already has that patch so it should be ok.</p><p>I&#039;ve been streaming video from a PC (wired) to my Raspberry Pi (wifi) without any issues.
