I switched back to r1497 and lost both radios after around 1 hour 45 minutes of uptime. So I would say this indicates the changes between August 31st and September 4th as the most likely to have introduced the issue. I guess it is time to carry this over the the LEDE tracker...</p><p>It seems that moving one of the clients (a nexus 5X) into another room triggered the issue, so it might be related to changing or poor radio conditions and might not show up easily with all clients in good RF-visibility to the router&#039;s antennas...</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;M.</p>									</div>

I am back at getting r1481 tested for longer than 24 hours, but my interim conclusion is that both/either of r1482 and r1483 are involved in my issue (maybe 1482 introducing the root cause and r1483 just making ir easier to toggle, but that is pure conjecture).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>moeller0</strong> on 17 Sep 2016, 23:45)</p>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m having some trouble with DNAT, on WNDR3700v2 (LEDE build, r1298)<br />I&#039;ve set the firewall to redirect some ports to a Debian machine on my local network, which have itself a firewall which distinguates &quot;local&quot; packets (basically 192.168.x.y) and &quot;foreign&quot; ones (everything else). Amongst redirected ports are smtp-related ports (25/465/587), and torrent port (custom port, 12345)</p><p>The logs on the Debian machine shows that some foreign packets seem to originate from my router.</p><p>I unfortunately can&#039;t reproduce this by hand, as this behaviour seems to be only triggered when a lot of packets arrive : I&#039;ve seen it for Torrent connections (torrent clients are not reputed for their niceness), as well as spamming &quot;relay&quot; attempts.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure this is related to hnyman&#039;s build, as I <em>think</em> I had the same behaviour with an old build from arokh.<br />It might also be WNDR3700-specific, or just a faulty unit on my side.</p><p>Did anyone encountered this ? Any ideas to investigate further ?</p>									</div>

While spammer clients might be mischievous about their source IP, it is highly unlikely that they used my router&#039;s internal address by blind luck.<br />- besides, if an packet with a &quot;private&quot; (RFC 1928) source IP arrives on the WAN port, shouldn&#039;t the router drop it ?</p>									</div>

					<p>hi hnyman, thanks for the lede builds and i&#039;m using r1476 in my wndr3700v2.&nbsp; since your build already have the full wpad, i like to make a small request in your future builds to include authsae.&nbsp; i have been testing 802.11s mesh since i have a few atheros based routers at my disposal.&nbsp; thanks.</p>									</div>
