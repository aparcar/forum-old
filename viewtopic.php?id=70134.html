					<p>Hello.<br />I made a mistake changing the LAN protocol to PPP and now I cannot access the router. Wifi was disabled and through the LAN ports I cannot communicate with router.<br />I cannot get to restore the router by pressing the RESET button. Is this normal with OpenWRT firmware?<br />Router was flashed with 15.05.1 with default config.<br />HELP!!! Is there any other way to Reset config without using Serial cable?<br />Thanks :-)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kokoliso</strong> on 10 Mar 2017, 14:24)</p>

					<p>Try recovery mode.&nbsp; Boot up, during the 2 seconds or so that the &quot;gear&quot; LED is flashing fast press the reset button-- then it should start flashing really fast and continue to do so.&nbsp; Now you can telnet to 192.168.1.1 and either run a firstboot to reset to defaults, or run mount_root then fix your configuration.</p>									</div>
