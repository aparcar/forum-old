					<p>Hi,<br />I&#039;m trying to install OpenWrt via ethernet cable on EasyBox 802 (aka Arcadyan ARV752DPW) and in other to do that I need to change the default bootloader with U-Boot. The problem is that I am unable to find a compatible one for this router.</p><p>I could find only one U-Boot version: <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09-beta2/lantiq/danube/uboot-lantiq-arv752DPW_flash/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_ … DPW_flash/</a> and for some reasons it doesn&#039;t work.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>File verification failed</p></blockquote></div><p>On its wiki page <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/arcadyan/arv752dpw#flash_to_openwrt_without_opening_the_device">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/arcadyan/ar … the_device</a> all download links are dead.</p><p>What can I do? I was thinking to build one myself, but having zero experience in doing that I&#039;m afraid I will brick it...</p>									</div>

					<p>The direct download without opening the device would be very nice and fast, but the documentation seems to have not the final state. And uboot might not work with the ethernet.

					<p>I have an Easybox 802 running now with an uptime of 38 days.<br />LuCI, Samba for sharing a USB stick, two WLAN segments (if I need just the this one IP range for tftp) and DSL of course. <br />POTS and ISDN not needed/neglected.<br />The box has (eye of the beholder) nice design.&nbsp; I only would have expected the red plastic strip between the halves <br />strip to glow.</p><p>But it was a stony path, ending with Barrier Breaker (Chaos Calmer is not working because of PCI problems causing wifi errors, see #18369, #19856, #20997):<br />- flashed uboot according to <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/arcadyan/arv752dpw">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/arcadyan/arv752dpw</a> (first load uboot with the brn-file, then flash the nor-file),&nbsp; with the files from my own build,<br />- kernel/dts needs other partition boundaries on flash to fit a newer and bigger uboot (as it is in ARV752DPW22.dts, lesson learnt<br />kernel command line does not work for it, only in the device tree it can be changed),<br />- lzma on flash crashes, lzo works <br />(see <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/arcadyan/arv7510pw">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/arcadyan/arv7510pw</a> for patches, I have also applied the DSL patch)</p><p>Opening the case for getting access to the serial port requires a mix of violence and patience.<br />There are screws at the bottom. These have to be removed of course. But they have more or less a decorative role.<br />A dozen of hook/tab pairs still hold the halves together.<br />However I have milled a porthole, when the box was open (no tab broken during opening), <br />on the backside, on the same height as the upper edge<br />of the recess for the TAE ports, between the recess and the type plate (sticker).<br />On a closed box I would make the hole with a hot nail or something like a heated knive (no chips falling inside).</p>									</div>

					<p>So, nothing to lose, open the damn case and look what flash chip is used.<br />Chance its compatible with standard flashers used to recover PC bios<br />The one I have is CH341. It works well with SPI and I2C chips.<br />If i had to reflash bootloader, I&#039;d try first loading it into RAM or instead of firmware and execute there</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bolvan</strong> on 16 Jan 2016, 10:49)</p>

					<p>Never mind. I compiled a few of them from u-boot-lantiq sources (snapshots 2013.10, 2014.01, 2014.01-next, 2014.04).<br />The 2014.04 snapshot is broken, the others work fine.</p>									</div>
