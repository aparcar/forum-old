Of course they can fix the exploit. But If it is in one of their publicly available <em>signed</em> firmwares--which is kind of the point--then they would have to disallow firmware downgrades, even to signed versions. I&#039;m not sure if they can actually do that willy-nilly without alienating a good chunk of their customer base ... once again.</p><p>Other than that, there is a point to be made to keep exploits under wraps as long as there are others that exist, to pull them out of the drawer once every other exploit has been closed.</p>									</div>
