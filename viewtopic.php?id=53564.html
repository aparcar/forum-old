					<p>Typo. Putty records even typing errors and I missed some...<br />It&#039;s /dev/sda1 in that mount command. Mounting was never a problem.</p><p>In the mean time I tested more. It seems that tar command is not the cause. Any writing operation on ext2 causes errors after umount, even rm.<br />ext3 with journal - no more errors, but I would prefer not to use journalling on flash drives.<br />The flash has no errors. Write-tested during format (-cc option).</p><p>The router is Asus WL-500gP (a Bytton EDGE in fact, a modification based on WL-500gP board).<br />BB i/o AA &lt;== don&#039;t know what that is. If you are referring to Barrier Breaker, RC3 was unstable on my router.</p><p>I didn&#039;t specify block size during format. I think it&#039;s 4096, but I&#039;m not sure. I&#039;ll look when I get home.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>M95D</strong> on 24 Oct 2014, 08:17)</p>
