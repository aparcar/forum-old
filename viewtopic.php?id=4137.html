					<p>Hey everyone,</p><p>I have a bricked WRT54GS 2.0.&nbsp; I have the Jtag cable made from Hairymaid&#039;s guide, and also his software.&nbsp; I can successfully transfer the CFE.BIN file to the router but it never lets me ping it after a reboot or after the transfer.&nbsp; It&#039;s like the router never actually boots from the new firmware.</p><p>The transfers all seem to work fine.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also tried, through the GUI version of his software, to upload the entire linksys firmware without success.</p><p>This is the guide:</p><p><a href="http://www.ranvik.net/prosjekter-privat/jtag_for_wrt54g_og_wrt54gs/how_to_jtag_winxp.txt">http://www.ranvik.net/prosjekter-privat â€¦ _winxp.txt</a></p><p>I&#039;ve been beating my head against the wall for three days trying to get this thing alive again.&nbsp; Can anyone offer suggestions?</p><p>Also, I am not 100 percent certain of the fact that I have the correct CFE.BIN for this router (HairdairyMaid&#039;s ftp calls the file CFE.BIN-wrt54gs2.0-can_be_bad which makes me wonder if it&#039;s bogus).&nbsp; Does anyone have this file that I can snag?</p><p>Totally at a loss and I need this router to finish a project.</p><p>Anyone?</p><p>Thanks very much,<br />Jim</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gdijim</strong> on 18 Jan 2006, 09:54)</p>

					<p>Try using a CFE (with boot wait set to on) from the the openwrt site at <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/people/inh/cfe/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/people/inh/cfe/</a> then tftp up the RC4 version of OpenWrt.&nbsp; You can ask in the irc channel #openwrt if you get stuck.&nbsp; If you are into more hardware mods then you can attach a serial console and see what CFE is doing.</p>									</div>

Download windoz program to create CFE.BIN from <a href="http://www.wlan-skynet.de/download/index.shtml">www.wlan-skynet.de/download/index.shtml</a>.&nbsp; Then create CFE.BIN for my particular router.</p><p>2. ./wrt54g -erase:wholeflash</p><p>3. ./wrt54g -flash:cfe&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ( I do not want to reflash wholeflash because it needs hours :-(</p><p>4. Then reboot the router.&nbsp; &nbsp; Power LED is always blinking.&nbsp; &nbsp;DMZ led never lit on or blink, never!!&nbsp; &nbsp;Internet LED (connect to another router) and Ethernet LED No. 1 (where I connect my pc) are ON.&nbsp; &nbsp;At this point, ping 192.168.1.1 is OK, there&#039;s reply from router.</p><p>5.&nbsp; Then force my PC ethernet eth0 to 10baseT full duplex by issuing:&nbsp; &nbsp;mii-tool -F 10baseT-FD eth0&nbsp; &nbsp;(I use debian distribution).&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Warning:&nbsp; without forcing to 10baseT, I can tftp to router, BUT... BUT after receiving the firmware,&nbsp; the router never works..... I mean after reboot the router is still in situation No.4 above.... Power LED is always blinking.... etc.....</p><p>6. Then tftp any working &quot;openwrt&quot; firmware :-)</p><p>7. Do not need to power off and on the router, let it soft-reboots by itself.... wait a moment... be patient :-)</p><p>8... Magic happen.... my router works again.....</p><p>Thanks to HairyDairyMaid for the JTAG (hw and sw) and <a href="http://www.wlan-skynet.de">www.wlan-skynet.de</a> for creating CFE.BIN for my WRT54GS V4.</p>									</div>
