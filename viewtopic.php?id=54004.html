					<p>Hi,</p><p>I installed open-wrt on tp-link wdr 3600. Everything went fine until I started to use cisco anyconnect mobility client on my laptop (ethernet connection to the router). It initially got connected to my company vpn gateway. But within 1 minute, it would start reconnecting and stay in that status. </p><p>I installed kmod-ipt-nathelper-extra but did not see any change for the problem. What could be wrong? I would appreciate any tip.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jwang</strong> on 14 Nov 2014, 08:37)</p>

					<p>I own a WDR4300 (same hardware than WDR3600 except for wifi) with &quot;Barrier Breaker 14.07&quot;; using the same VPN client, I have detected zero issues: my link stays up for hours. I would check first that your machine still has internet connection when the VPM goes down.</p>									</div>

					<p>What happened was the VPN client made successful connection initially. Then within 1 minute, it started to reconnect and I could not access any web site. But I was able to ping the ip address of my vpn gateway. So I added dns server from my isp in the custom dns server entry. That made the connection to work and I can access web page both inside and outside company network.</p><p>But there is still one issue. After I connected to vpn, I could not telnet or access 192.168.1.1. I even could not ping 192.168.1.1. Is that a fact of life or I need to do some configuration?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jwang</strong> on 14 Nov 2014, 18:54)</p>

					<p>My company has configured the Cisco client so all traffic goes through the VPN tunnel, I cannot even reach other machines inside my network; so it could be normal, but your mileage may vary...</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s same for me, once VPN is up all traffic goes to tunnel. If you really want to mess things up you can try to configure a split tunnel by adding entry into routing table for the local network. The question if whether it is worth the hassle.</p>									</div>
