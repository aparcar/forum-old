					<p>Just installed OpenWRT earlier today, OpenWrt BarrierBreaker 14.07 on a Netgear WNDR4000, and I&#039;m having trouble accessing the configuration.&nbsp; I was initially able to telnet to the router and was able to set up the password, then I decided to plug in the cable from my modem into the WAN port to test it out before I configured it.&nbsp; I was able to access the internet but now I am unable to telnet to the router anymore.&nbsp; </p><p>I tried unplugging the modem from the router, tried switching LAN ports, I have tried booting the router into failsafe mode, and I have tried finding the address if the router using angry IP scanner with no luck.&nbsp; It still works as a bridge so i don&#039;t think it&#039;s bricked or anything but I can&#039;t access the configuration and I am having to use my external IP since I&#039;m connecting the router directly to my modem.</p><p>So basically what I am trying to ask is how do I get back into the configuration of the router?&nbsp; I feel like I&#039;m missing something basic but I have been at it for hours and am out of ideas.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>BorisYeltsin</strong> on 27 Sep 2015, 02:34)</p>

					<p>Start with this <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/firstlogin">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/firstlogin</a><br />If your router has been reset to fail safe then this should work.</p><p>Your device should be at 192.168.1.1.&nbsp; Set the IP of a client to 192.168.1.2 and do not connect the wan., just a lan cable.</p><p>In general if you have a valid flash you should be able to login to Luci and set your password with out needing telnet.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you use telnet, it gets disabled after you set the initial password and you need to ssh after that.</p><p>After you get in and set the password, reboot and then all should work.&nbsp; Connect your WAN.</p><p>No clue why this is a bridge, or you think it&#039;s a bridge.&nbsp; If you configured it as a bridge and did not set the LAN IP for the device as a static IP you have no DHCP and thus no IP for the device, and be unable to connect.&nbsp; Your main router will need to supply an IP or you need to get the device reset.&nbsp; Not familiar with the devices reset process.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have tried ssh as well, with and without the WAN connected, but I&#039;m not able to connect to 192.168.1.1.&nbsp; I also haven&#039;t been able to reset to fail safe mode either, I have tried both methods of triggering fail safe mode with no success.&nbsp; I have tried setting my IP to 192.168.1.2 and disconnecting the WAN and restarting the router, but I&#039;m unable to connect to the router and angry IP scanner says there are no other devices connected in the 192.168.1.X range.&nbsp; I think it is acting as a bridge because this computer is getting assigned a 184.x.x.x address when the WAN is connected to the router instead of some other internal IP.</p>									</div>

					<p>Continued to try to activate failsafe mode on the router in order to SSH to configure it, but none of the buttons seem to activate the failsafe.&nbsp; I am able to ping the router at 192.168.1.1 about 10 seconds after I start it, but pressing any buttons for any length of time doesnt seem to do anything</p>									</div>
