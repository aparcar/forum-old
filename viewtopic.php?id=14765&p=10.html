					<p>As far as I can tell the RB433 uses the ICPlus IP175 Ethernet switch to create the 2nd and 3rd Ethernet ports. There has been some discussion surrounding the ICPlus IP175 switch. I believe that this is the same switch that is used on the RB450 as well as the RB192. (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/Ip175C">http://wiki.openwrt.org/Ip175C</a>). </p><p>In some of the previous posts in this thread I see the following (in the dmesg outputs which have been posted):</p><p>serial8250 serial8250.0: unable to register port at index 3 (IO2e8 MEM0 IRQ3): -28<br />ICPlus IP175C: Registered new driver&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;------ *******<br />Infineon ADM6996: Registered new driver</p><p>For some reason I do not see this in my dmesg (posted a couple of days ago in this thread -- page 9 bottom). </p><p>I guess my question is this... Should we be able to program the switch to make the system operate as if there were 3 Ethernet interfaces, or will this device always act like 1 main ethernet interface (eth0) and 2 additional ethernet interfaces on a switch (eth1 and eth2)? </p><p>I believe that the RB450 uses this switch to create a group of ports, when they are discussed in this thread they have been referred to as separate Ethernet ports. So I am not 100% sure why these are not available in a similar manner. </p><p>Any help in this would be great appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello Guys ..... i bought a RB450, which will be arriving tomorrow, and never used RouterBoards and neither Mikrotik OS. But, when i searched and found that a Linux-Like OS was available to RBs, i immediately wanna use that instead of the original OS.</p><p>I have found this thread, read it, found that you had several problems making OpenWRT compatible with RB450 but seems work is done and it&#039;s running fine.</p><p>i would like to make some questions and would be glad if you could help me. These may seems stupid questions, but as i said, i&#039;m completly new with all this RouterBoard and OpenWRT thing. My RouterBoard didnt even arrived while i&#039;m writing this message.</p><br /><p>question 1) installing OpenWRT on RB450 would be similar to instructions paulCuter posted on this thread (page 9) ?? He used a RB433 board and i&#039;ll be using a RB450.</p><br /><p>question 2) would it be easier to simply use binary images or build my own images ?? I dont need any special features, just booting and eth working would be fine. There&#039;s no miniPCI slot on RB450, so no wifi thing is needed. I&#039;ll be using it for iptables/openvpn/dhcp/dns basically only.</p><br /><p>question 3) if answer to #2 points to use binary images, should i use binary images from <a href="http://wifi.ozo.com/airo/openwrt/firmware/kamikaze/2.6/ar71xx/12286/">http://wifi.ozo.com/airo/openwrt/firmwa … 1xx/12286/</a> or binary images from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ar7/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ar7/</a>&nbsp; ?? In fact, i&#039;m in doubt even if the second like are for RB450 boards ....&nbsp; </p><p>question 4) .... to come after i got OpenWRT working on my new RB450 <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>									</div>

					<p>Good question from leonardogyn , my problem is the same.</p><p>Suguestion, a new tip only for RB450, It donÂ´t have wireless.</p><p>Is so hard to find information about it, mixed which wireless information.

					<p>OK, here&#039;s what I did to get my RB450 working. This will compile everything, no binary pkgs. </p><p>0. connect to the RB via a serial cable (115k/8/N/1/N), start the board, enter the boot menu (press a key) and set the boot option to network/DHCP<br />1.&nbsp; svn co&nbsp; <a href="https://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk">https://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk</a><br />2. cd trunk ; make menuconfig<br />3. Enable Advanced configuration / Show broken platforms [ is this still necessary ?] <br />4. choose Target System / Atheros AR71xx [2.6]<br />5. Target Images: ramdisk <br />6. Configure whatever modules/packages you&#039;ll need. I left it on defaults.<br />7. make [ takes long ]<br />8. bring up a dhcp/tftp server on the network<br />9. cp bin/openwrt-ar71xx-vmlinux.elf /var/lib/tftpboot/ [ or wherever your tftp dir is ]<br />10. create a dhcpd entry/range for the board and specify &#039;filename &quot;openwrt-ar71xx-vmlinux.elf&quot;;&#039;<br />11. reboot the board and telnet to it.</p><p>I&#039;m sure others will chime in about binary pkgs and how to deploy the system to the flash memory.</p><p>HTH,<br />Tiv</p>									</div>

					<p>The next work in RB450: configure the IP175C to provide 5 ethernet (eth0 to eth4), like mikrotik OS.<br />The atual net suport see only the 2 Atheros ethernet. The default IP175 suport/config put eth0 in letf RJ45 port (the POE port - Eth1 in the case) and eth1 in switch with next 4 rj45.<br />In RB150, we use admswconfig to config the switch. If we can create some application/pkg like that.<br />I think in use the same steps to read IP175 registers, expose in this thread, and try to find the way used in original OS.<br />The start is in <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/Ip175C">http://wiki.openwrt.org/Ip175C</a>.</p>									</div>

As far as I know, the CPU has 2 logical interfaces (i.e. 2 distinct MAC addresses), and by default, one is assigned to the &#039;leftmost&#039; connector, and the rest are configured as a 4-port switch (with one internal MAC address being the other MAC).</p><p>I _GUESS_ you can have 5 or whatever number of Linux network interfaces by doing some advanced ifconfig magic (pseudo-interfaces of the eth0:1 kind), but at the frame level you&#039;re still going to have &quot;crosstalk&quot; between the lines on the 4-port switch.<br />You can probably change this 1-4 assignment to 2-3 or similar (e.g. with Broadcomm boards it is possible) but physically you can have no more than 2 Ethernet interfaces on the board.</p><p>I&#039;d be happy to get corrected on this though.</p><p>tiv</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tiv</strong> on 9 Sep 2008, 11:09)</p>

					<p>i&#039;m successfully running OpenWRT on RB450 and, at first, i tought it would enable only 2 physical network connectors instead of the 5 network connectors available using the RouterOS.

					<p>tiv,</p><p>I have seen people use VLAN tags inside the Ethernet switch and the actual Linux interface which accepts the packets from the switch to make it appear that there are multiple physical interfaces when you really only have one physical interface and an on board switch which exposes more. We could do this with teh RB433 and RB450. I am not sure if the switch configuration driver is working. I think that right now the driver is in the system (ip175C) but I have been unable to determine if it is actually working or how to communicate with the switch through this driver. </p><p>I am not overly concerned about exposing multiple ethernet interfaces (eth1, eth2, eth3, etc) but I would like to be able to see the state of the external interfaces (up | down), the link speed (10 | 100), and some other parameters like this. I would be happy to dig in and configure the switch using the datasheet if someone could confirm that the driver should work and possibly some guidance on how to communicate with the driver. </p><p>If I do nto hear anything I will try to dig in and see what I can determine, but if I woudl appreciate any guidance the community has.</p>									</div>
