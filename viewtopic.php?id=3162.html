					<p>Hi,</p><p>The manual of your asus is a standard manual of many AR7WRD devices with NSP 3.6.</p><p>Check out.</p><p><a href="http://www.solwise.co.uk">www.solwise.co.uk</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; model solwise dsl600ew (AR7WRD + MARVELL)<br /><a href="http://www.netcomm.com.au">www.netcomm.com.au</a>&nbsp; model NB5plus4W (AR7WRD + MARVELL)<br /><a href="http://www.aztech.com">www.aztech.com</a>&nbsp; model DSL600EW (AR7WRD+ MARVELL)</p><p>The source code of the NB5PLUS4W can be found on Netcomm&#039;s ftp server </p><p><a href="ftp://202.44.167.165">ftp://202.44.167.165</a><br />user: source<br />pass: s0urc3</p><br /><p>I experience the same problems with DNS, proxy, port forwarding not working on my Aztech with firmware 66.xx.xx. These firmwares are based on NSP 3.6.<br />An older firmware 43.xx.xx based on NSP 3.3 does not have these problems.</p><p>You can try your luck with the source code of the netgear DG834G (AR7WRD + MARVELL)which has the same specs. </p><p>I noticed from the asus manual, that it does not use adam2 as it&#039;s boot loader, but PSPboot. But maybe that is a error in the manual.</p><br /><p>You maybe want to check out my messages in the Netgear forum (AZTECH DSL600EW)</p>									</div>

					<p>thanks to both of you for your helpful posts.</p><p>it seems ive got a lot of learning to do before I get this router going as I want it to. <br />Im happy to say I managed to get in on ssh, dont know what I was doing wrong before but ssh&#039;ing the router ip and typeing the password got me in. </p><p>Im going to do some reading up about how these things work, ill check out the links yellownotblack lists. Please let me know. In addition Ive got a whole load of newbie question you might be able to help me with. If youve got answer/faq/or a reference please help.</p><p>1. my box is openwrt right? all ar7xxx chips use it?<br />2. given that the features on my router dont work, am I likely to be entitled to a refund? would I want that? is this a good router?<br />3. how dangerous would it be to flash with firmware of a similar model from another vendor? <br />4. the firmware file is an all in one for all components? would for instance having a different bootloader to that of the firmware being flashed likely not work? <br />5. can I change individial components (such as use NSP 3.3) by changing the software on the box?<br />6. whats the best way to move software to my box? do i need to setup NIS? <br />7. in talking about firmware are we talking about everything on the box at reset time? ie the entire OS? <br />8. how would having the source code for my boxs software help me? Am I going to have to debug the code, cross comile it for my box and move it over? <br />9. what actually is NSP? </p><p>sorry if these are confused newbie-esq questions. all you help is appreciated. </p><p>btw. I tried to get the source for the nb5plus4w from <a href="ftp://202.44.167.165">ftp://202.44.167.165</a><br />I could get in here without login, but there was no source code on it. just a couple of bin files. Any ideas? <br />would this source be ng&#039;s modifications of the openwrt source? </p><p>here is the software versions from my routers http interface:</p><p>Software Versions<br />Gateway &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 3.6.0C_1T00<br />ATM Driver &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 4.05.03.00<br />DSL HAL &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 3.02.04.00<br />DSL Datapump &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 3.02.06.00 Annex A<br />SAR HAL &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 01.07.02<br />PDSP Firmware &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 0.49<br />Wireless Firmware &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1.6.0.24<br />Wireless APDK &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 5.7.0.6,<br />Boot Loader &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1.2.5.9</p><p>i&#039;ll do some reading,<br />chears, </p><p>Liam</p>									</div>

					<p>Funny,&nbsp; if you use IE to enter the website you get indeed those 2 bin files, which seems to be a firmware of something.</p><p>But use an FTP client like smartftp and you get the source code....</p><p>Will try to answere your questions later...it is very early in the morning now.</p>									</div>
