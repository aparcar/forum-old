					<p>WZR-HP-G300NH and minidlna work really well, all the way to 1080p. The only problem is the lack of inotify support in backfire, so whenever I add a new file, I have to rebuild the minidlna index by restarting it. In trunk inotify is supported, though.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks snk for your words... 1080 support sounds really really impressive!!!</p><p>Although your model has twice the RAM of the TL-WR1043ND I hope<br />that video streaming up to 720p is possible on the TP Link.<br />Increasing RAM with swap might be reasonable too....</p><p>Thanks for your information on inotify... hopefully this feature will be integrated<br />in future (stable) releases....</p>									</div>

					<p>minidlna is support to stream both 720p and 1080p, the limitation is brandwidth of router and if the connection is stable there is no problems for stream this formats.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the explanation....</p><p>I considered CPU performance and/or RAM <br />to be the limiting factors (bottlenecks)... but it <br />seems that 400 MHz and 32 MB of RAM should<br />work.</p><p>I think I can provide a stable connection.... so <br />I hope that streaming is somewhat usable <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>sorry.... didn&#039;t express that well; I meant: weak CPU performance or very little <br />RAM can/could be somehow limiting the ability of proper streaming</p><p>I&#039;m not that experienced with streaming...<br />especially high resolution materials.... but I am asking<br />because sometimes (and only sometimes) when <br />using media servers on my desktop CPU utilisation <br />is quite high...</p><p>Well, I am happy to hear that streaming to a DLNA<br />enabled device does not seem to be that ressource<br />intensive... so that it can be handled by the ressources<br />of a router with &quot;only&quot; 400 MHz and 32 MB RAM...</p><p>Any other hints or opinions?</p>									</div>

					<p>Many media server programs do transcoding (converting a media file from one format to another) on the fly, which is CPU intensive. MiniDLNA doesn&#039;t do it, so CPU speed is not that important.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m running a web server and minidlna on my RouterStation Pro. My Sony PS3 is connected by wired Ethernet and has no problems playing video and music stored on a usb hard disk connected to the RouterStation. minidlna seems to be pretty solid.</p>									</div>
