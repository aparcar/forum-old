					<p>I installed a buildroot on an Ubuntu-System:<br />&gt;uname -a<br />Linux ubuntu-desktop 2.6.27-7-generic #1 SMP Thu Oct 30 04:18:38 UTC 2008 i686 GNU/Linux</p><p>I&#039;ve so far successfully compiled an firmware-image without luci (./scripts/feeds uninstall luci).</p><p>My challenge is now, that i want to create a firmware-image with included <br />* asterisk (a sip phone should be able to call and do a little demonstration 10sec voice replay or short music file playing; the device should act as lone sip server with no other servers) [asterisk14-mini?] and<br />* freeradius (a Linksys WRT54GL v1.1 with standard firmware should be able to authenticate against the freeradius server for wep, ideally wpa and wpa2 too, Users should be saved on the same device) [freeradius_1?]</p><p>The device doesn&#039;t have to use wlan.</p><p>My problems are:<br />* Is this even feasible with 4MB?<br />* I have no idea which packages to select to fit into the memory of the device and to fulfill my requirements.<br />* The configuration part is also a bit tricky. Are there any good references on the setup of this functions, that apply to the kamikaze-packages?&nbsp; If yes, could you please fill me in on the links.</p><p>My main problem is therefore how do i know if something fits on the device, which packages do i select, which documentation has to be applied to the respective packages? I have looked around but the respective documentation must have eluded me.</p><p>Thanks in advance, for the help.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi.&nbsp; I&#039;m working on basically the same thing as you.&nbsp; I&#039;ve built a custom 8.09 firmware containing the asterisk-mini-1.4 package.&nbsp; Asterisk seems happy as long as there&#039;s nothing else running.&nbsp; If I try to start up other things (such as &quot;screen&quot;) I start running out of memory and my terminal session will hang.&nbsp; I&#039;ve noticed that when the &quot;free&quot; command reports the available memory &lt;600 then I&#039;ll start having problems.</p><p>The default asterisk-mini package can be trimmed down a little if you don&#039;t need all of it&#039;s features.&nbsp; For instance, if all you need is SIP, you can make sure the IAX module doesn&#039;t load to save memory.&nbsp; Just edit the /etc/asterisk/modules.conf file and &quot;noload&quot; the things that you don&#039;t need.&nbsp; This helped me a little.</p><p>I basically started with a fresh checkout of OpenWRT 8.09 from svn.&nbsp; I first built an image using the default config files and flashed my router to make sure everything worked.&nbsp; Then I rebuilt the image, adding in asterisk-mini and a few of my own custom asterisk config files.&nbsp; I re-flashed and started tinkering with the files in /etc/asterisk to make sure I could get things running.</p><p>I&#039;ve been working on trimming down asterisk and getting it running in 4MB of RAM so I&#039;m just now getting to a point where I&#039;m ready to start testing calls.&nbsp; I can&#039;t tell you yet whether it has enough horsepower to handle my calls.&nbsp; I don&#039;t plan to have more than one or two simultaneous calls and I&#039;m trying to select codecs that will minimize the workload on the router.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not using freeradius so I&#039;m not sure how much space that takes.&nbsp; I had problems running asterisk on the WRT54GL and getting all the features I needed.&nbsp; I kept getting random lockups due to low memory.&nbsp; I ended up purchasing a WRT54GS V.3 off ebay.&nbsp; It has 8MB flash and 32MB RAM.&nbsp; I fired up asterisk (not asterisk-mini) on it last night and it seemed to run OK.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t tested it extensively yet.</p>									</div>
