					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have troubles to configure our openwrt backup, especially to understand why to save especially mtd-devs. <br />Usually I would save the /etc/config/ files, but I am adviced by the wiki (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.backup">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.backup</a>) to make some dd of the mtd-devs.<br />So my beginner questions are:</p><p>- What is an ART-partition? Is this the mtd where the bootloader is stored? <br />If I do <br />&gt; grep &#039;&quot;art&quot;&#039; /proc/mtd | cut -c 1-4<br />I see the mtd4 is used as ART-partition, but shouldn`t it be mtd0 for locating the bootloader, should it? <br />- It is also adviced to do a dd of /dev/mtd0 for boot. So where is the difference between mtd4 and mtd0? </p><p>Help would be appreciated, thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>mtd0 is bootloader,ART is another partition.they are two different things.<br />Definitely you&#039;d better also backup you ART partition.</p><p>I will write a doc about i know latter.</p>									</div>

					<p>That depends totally by the device. E.g. in my WNDR3700 ART contains the MAC addresses etc., and is normally not touched by Openwrt at all.</p><p>There is no generic answer to your question.

					<p>After considering how to configure the backup integrating in our infrastructure we decided just to save the config files. Unfortunately we just can`t do a recursive scp on the /etc/-device regarding symlinks. So my plan is just to save /etc/config/ and the /root/ directory. (rsync isn&#039;t possible) Should this be enough or do we have to integrate some directories missing belonging in an essential backup?</p>									</div>

					<p>You might use LuCI GUI to make a demo backup for you. Then you could analyze the generated backup tar.gz file to see which files the built-in backup logic selected for backup.</p><p>In general you only need the contents of /etc/config. However, it depends on your config installed modules: there might be /etc/firewall.user, configured public SSH keys in /etc/dropbear/authorized_keys, FTP config in /etc/vsftpd and so on.</p><p>Have you checked /overlay ?&nbsp; In a &quot;normal&quot; setup you have read-only squashfs partition (from flash) and read-write jffs2 partition on top of that as &quot;overlay&quot;, into which all modified files go. All you modified files are there in /overlay. E.g. modified files of /etc are in actually in /overlay/etc . Looking into that /overlay will tell you, which config files have been modified. </p><p>You might also run a script in the router to generate a tar archive of the whole /etc directory tree, and then backup that single file. As I need only a few files, I generate my backup with:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
cd /etc
tar -czv -f /tmp/HNsettings vsftpd.conf aiccu.conf config/radvd* config/network* config/firewall* config/luci_statistics* config/qos* config/wireless* config/dhcp* dropbear/authorized_keys</code></pre></div>									</div>

					<p>I must say I am deeply impressed how fast you respond to my openwrt requests. If I want to restore our OpenWRT, I will have to know which packages where installed on our routers. <br />Is a package-list automatically saved in the overlay or does I need to save the &quot;opkg list-installed&quot;, also an overview of the installed packages seperately?</p>									</div>
