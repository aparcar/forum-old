					<p>Hi guys, I am working on installing OpenWrt on Mikrotik RB450G. I have been following the instructions on OpenWrt wiki.<br />I am having an issue working with wget2nand script. whenever I run the command <br />&#039;wget2nand [link to the image]&#039; . I get an error stating &#039;wget2nand already exists&#039;. I am not sure why I am not able to install the image on the flash. Is there a problem with the script or is there an another way to work around this? I have tested my connection and have followed documentation strictly.</p><p>Please let me know if you happen to find the solution to it. Thanks in advance.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kmali019</strong> on 24 Aug 2016, 00:10)</p>
