					<p>Can anyone tell me if it is possible to log every IP or domain that anyone inside my local network visits? I don&#039;t need to know any sensitive information - just a basic log with a timestamp and if possible a MAC or private IP that made the request. I don&#039;t need to do any blocking or filtering either.</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p>									</div>

					<p>squid does the job. <br />Rather trivial for http to set up the logging; a bit more complicated for https. Here it depends upon the details, you want to know. Transparent install of squid is probably, what you want, too.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well. Transparent proxy mode only works for HTTP but not for HTTPS unless you manage to fake foreign host certificates. Which of course is possible depending on your network infrastructure, but I refuse to suggest such a thing just because of security reasons.<br />Besides: in case of apps using certificate pinning (like I hope every online banking app on Android and iOS does) you will create at least some confusion since those apps will tell the user about a security breach.</p><p>To do it properly: <br />* Only enable transparent mode for HTTP but not for HTTPS.<br />* Make your gateway route HTTP to the proxy automatically for every host that is not your proxy.<br />* Block outgoing traffic to HTTPS entirely for every host that is not your proxy.<br />* Announce the proxy config to your clients. By wpad, by dhcp or by yellow post its on every coffee mug you find.</p>									</div>
