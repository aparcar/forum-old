					<p>Hi to all, I have got a netgear D7800 wich is running a stock firmware of netgear based on attitude adjustment. I just tried the trunk DD there are so much problems with the WAN interface(it can receive packets only if connected to another gigabit ethernet interface while if I connect it to a 100 megabit ethernet interface it can only send packets but not receive packets), the wireless interfaces don&#039;t work and i can&#039;t see any of them by using ifconfig, the ADSL modem doesn&#039;t work...so I ask your help cause I downloaded source code of the netgear firmware who contains thos modules/drivers to compile to get the same firmware, can I use some of those source codes to build my own DD trunk with those modules to get wireless, wan and modem work? How should I do? Because they has been used in the attitude adjustment so I don&#039;t know If it would work right...what should I edit in the make files? Sorry but I&#039;m a newbie in the compiling of firmware. Thanks to all to anyone who can help me, cheers from Italy ciaooo</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t believe stock Netgear firmware is OpenWrt based. </p><p>Netgear do release certain source code in terms of the GPL. If they release the drivers you want then theoretically you can port them into OpenWrt.

					<p>Even if this might sound rude, but... If you have to ask, you won&#039;t be able to do it.</p><p>It starts with checking if the relevant stuff is actually included -and available as source- in the vendor tarball, combined with most likely a lot of forward-/ backporting (highly non-trivial) and sprinkled with a big chance of bricking your device. There simply is no step-by-step guide for this, you&#039;d need to have a solid understanding about what you&#039;re doing and either quite some experience with developing on embedded devices and/or very fault-tolerant hardware which forgives you trying, while gathering said experience. Either way, if you had said experience, you wouldn&#039;t ask for generic howtos (which simply don&#039;t exist, as every device provides you with different challenges - only long term experience helps you find (partial) common ground), but would come up with quite specific questions about problematic details.</p>									</div>
