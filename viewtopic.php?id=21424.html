					<p>Hi,</p><p>i attached a SD-Card to my Linksys WRT54GL 1.1. The following gpio&#039;s are used:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>2 = data-in
4 = data-out
3 = clock
7 = chip select</code></pre></div><p>The installed OpenWRT version is KAMIKAZE 8.09.1, r16278 (kernel 2.6). I installed these packages:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>kmod-mmc    2.6.25.20-brcm47xx-1

kmod-mmc-spi    2.6.25.20-brcm47xx-1
luci-app-mmc_over_gpio    0.8.7-1</code></pre></div><p>To get the card working i had to modify the mmc_over_gpio startup script. The gpio for data-in was set to 5, but i use gpio 2.</p><p>The invocation of &#039;/etc/init.d/mmc_over_gpio start&#039; results then in the following output from dmesg:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>gpio-mmc: Failed to request mmc_spi module.

Is there anything i can do to improve the speed?</p><p>I hope, someone can give me some hints to solve the problem.</p><p>Greetings Joe</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>because i got no hints how to improve the speed with kernel 2.6 and the mentioned packages, i decided to switch to kernel 2.4 image of 8.09.1 for the WRT54GL 1.1.</p><p>I used the mmc driver and instructions from thread <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=82744#p82744">Problem with SDHC card#21</a>.</p><p>The modification of the configuration was no problem. You only have to ensure that &quot;dbg&quot; is set to something different than 0.</p><p>dmesg gives me:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[INF] sdhc: Version: 2.0.1  Parms: major=0 din=2 dout=4 clk=3 cs=7 maxsec=32 rahead=2 dbg=0001

real    0m 42.03s

real    1m 17.88s
user    0m 0.07s
sys     0m 56.63s
Divide 32768 by elapsed seconds (real) to get throughput in KB/s</code></pre></div><p>As you can see the results are much better (compared to the values achieved with kernel 2.6 and default driver).<br />write speed: 780kb/s<br />read speed: 420kb/s</p><p>This is more than 10 times faster. </p><p>So there is still the question, why kernel 2.6 with standard mmc driver only achieves 25kb/s. Is there something wrong with that driver or do you have to do more than adjusting the gpios for configuration?</p><p>Greetings Joe</p>									</div>

					<p>Well i encountered exactly the same problem with the mmc_over_gpio modul and kernel 2.6. I also switched back to 2.4...</p><p>It would be interesting to know if someone was able to get his sdmod working with reasonable speed under kernel 2.6...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>resus</strong> on 24 Oct 2009, 01:53)</p>
