					<p>I just got my WR810N(US) today. Flashed OpenWrt trunk and everything worked fine (haven&#039;t tested USB though).</p><p>The US version is very similar to the EU version. They have same CPU, RAM, and Flash, so the same openwrt firmware just works fine. It is a little bit smaller than the EU version, because it does not have the hardware switch for AP/3G/ROUTER (2 programmable GPIO in OpenWrt). FCC have some nice pictures of it. <a href="https://fccid.io/document.php?id=2892948">https://fccid.io/document.php?id=2892948</a></p><p>Since TP-Link now locks firmware on US version due to FCC regulations, flashing openwrt directly from the web interface didn&#039;t work. Then, I tried TP-Link&#039;s TFTP recovery mode (press reset while booting). I used Wireshark to listen for ARP, but the little box never ask for an IP address. I guess TP-Link just removed the TFTP recovery function in US version in order to make it harder to flash 3rd party firmwares.</p><p>Flashing via serial console should still work as always, but I didn&#039;t bother to try it. Thankfully, I found <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=63123">this method</a> from our forum, which basically disables the firmware check via shell injection in the web interface. It did the trick and now I&#039;m running openwrt. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>OpenWrt trunk for WR810n: <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr810n-squashfs-factory.bin">https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots â€¦ actory.bin</a></p><p>Some picture of it (smaller one) with my old WR720n (larger one):</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/eE4OF99.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/eE4OF99.jpg" /></span></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7av0pc9.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/7av0pc9.jpg" /></span></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/8GeTQHx.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/8GeTQHx.jpg" /></span></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>edwards</strong> on 22 May 2016, 10:11)</p>
