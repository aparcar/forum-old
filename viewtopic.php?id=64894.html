Please try wwan anf tun0 and report back whether it works or not. SQM will also work on the outer interfaces, but the DSCP logic probably will not find the markings of encapsulated packets, so it will effectively work as 1-tier shaper (same as simplest.qos).</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ll try them both - right now, with simple.qos and running on eth0, it does limit bandwidth to the up/down rates I specify.</p><p>Part of my question is, depending on what interface I set, will SQM &quot;see&quot; the actual flows, or just the one giant flow of UDP packets for tun0? I don&#039;t understand SQM well enough to have more than a guess at the proper interface, but I would guess tun0, since by the time anything hits wwan, it&#039;s already encapsulated.</p>									</div>

Now with SQM active on an interface where it sees the real IP headers things work better. I believe you will need to make sure that you set the correct overhead to account for the added IP/UDP headers (so probably 20+20+14 bytes, assuming IPv4), might be worthwhile to play around/test a few different overhead values and see whether it affects bufferbloat...</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>

For bulk transfers you can &quot;emulate&quot; that by simply reducing the shaped bandwidth, but if you then actually have say 100 Packets/second of 900 bytes each with 100 bytes per packet overhead (I am making these numbers up while I write so there are just exemplary) you end up with (900+100)*100 = 100000 bytes/second with an overhead-ignoring shaper set to 900*100 = 90000 so 10% slack. Normaly the kernel tries to be helpful and adds the per packet overhead it knows of automatically, but let&#039;s pretend it does not and see what happens when we take really small packets (say 100 bytes) and try to saturate the shaper:<br />90000 / 100 = 900 packets of 100 bytes each, now add the overhead to calculate the on the wire size:<br />900 * (100 + 100) = 180000, this is twice what the shaper was configured to so this shaper will probably not work well against bufferbloat in up- downstream devices....<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But as I said typically the kernel tries to account for that, and typically knows about the inner tcp/udp/icmp headers and yje IP header, but with your configuration I am not sure whether the shaper takes the full outer header (ethernet, IP &amp; UDP ) into account or not...</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>

Personally I dislike this as it leaves a non-obvious failure mode lurking that will be hard to debug once it triggers (with a load with lots of small packets). Figuring out which overhead to actually account for is unfortunately not straight forward...</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>
