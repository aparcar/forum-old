					<p>Hi, sorry I&#039;m a nooby to OPENWRT but:</p><p>I&#039;ve been using HyperWRT for some time and I want to know how they compare so:<br /> - Can you configure a WDS using the HTTP interface?<br /> - Can you configure DNS and static DHCP within the HTTP interface?<br /> - Is there any marked difference in reliability or speed between HyperWRT and OpenWRT?<br /> - Are there screenshots of the HTTP Interface?</p><p>I realize it&#039;s a step up complexity wise and it&#039;s not 1.0 yet, but I just find HyperWRT slightly buggy these days. Also (please don&#039;t say when it&#039;s finished) is there any word on when the release date might be for 1.0 (if there isn&#039;t just say &quot;no there isn&#039;t).</p>									</div>
