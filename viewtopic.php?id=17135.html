					<p>Hello all the active OpenWrt developers,</p><p>I would like to ask you to recommend me &quot;the best&quot; practice to start a project based on OpenWrt, which would be based on a different philosophy.</p><p>I do like OpenWrt&#039;s package system and ability to configure anything your way as the whole filesystem is in fact writeable, I have been using it on wireless Atheros SoC routers with 4 MB flash for quite a long time.. BUT this philosophy is not suitable for those who need to run/operate tens or hundreds of similar devices: I can not easily keep all the devices up-to-date having the same set of packages and configuration (most settings are identical for all the devices, they differ only in IP adresses and a few more parameters)...</p><p>I need two things:</p><p>(A) a single &quot;read-only&quot; firmware with pre-selected set of packages</p><p>(B) a simple single configuration file describing only the few settings unique to the single unit (the remaining common parameters should be contained in the firmware), this configuration must be preserved within upgrades of firmware (placed elsewhere in the flash)</p><p>You all have done a great work so far and it must be an advantage to base any open wireless firmware on your work (and keep in sync with it). While (A) seems to be almost solved with your squashfs images, the (B) requires not only additional functionality (a new package), but it completely changes the way OpenWrt starts and will influence many other packages.</p><p>How do you recommend me to do it? Should I ask the repository maintainers to allow me for a branch in svn or am I able to somehow incorporate the changes into the trunk? I don&#039;t know the kamikaze build system thoroughly, it might be only a build option to choose between classical /etc configuration and the single file configuration... I refuse to fork your project completely, I found it to be the worst way how to integrate someone&#039;s requirements into an open-source project.</p><p>TIA for your opinions.</p><p>Milan</p>									</div>

					<p>I think what you are planning can be achieved easily through extended use of UCI.<br />Take a look at the -P parameter of the &#039;uci&#039; command. It selects a new path to store configuration deltas generated by &#039;uci set&#039; in.<br />You could do a small modification to /etc/functions.sh to include your custom search path when scripts do config_load. And when you change the node specific configuration option, you use something like this: uci -P /path/to/your/config set network.lan.ipaddr=1.2.3.4<br />Keeping these files over reflash is not implemented for Atheros SoC yet, but can be done easily.<br />You can either wait for us to add the new firmware format (or add your own) which combines fs and kernel into one single image, or you make some modifications to sysupgrade to allow it to either take two image files on the command line or split one image into both partitions.<br />The generic parts of sysupgrade are already developed far enough to be able to preserve your config on reflash without dedicated parameters.</p><p>Additionally you can use ./scripts/env in the build tree to manage images for different categories/kinds of devices.</p><p>Let me know if you need any additional information. It would be great if you could work on this in a way that allows us to merge all the required core changes into our repository, letting you maintain the rest as add-on packages.</p>									</div>
