					<p>I have On Networks N150R with OpenWrt openwrt-15.05.1-ar71xx-generic-n150r-squashfs-factory.img from jchau’s Google drive (found via a thread referenced on the OpenWrt N150 page) – and apparently working. For use with CenturyLink GPON (fiber optic) Internet for the WAN I need VLAN autodetect, tagged, ID 201. Can I do this? I’m not finding it in the web-based setup interface. (I did find the PPOE login setting in the setup interface).</p><p>Possible clue: jchau says that image has &quot;•enabled CONFIG_LUCI_SRCDIET, which &quot;Minify Lua sources&quot;.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>donparda</strong> on 23 Oct 2016, 09:28)</p>

					<p>Looks like I need additional switch configuration. I still find myself wondering if there is something that got left out of this &quot;compressed-to-use-less-memory&quot; build that eliminated an easy way to setup VLAN tagging on the WAN. Or am I just ignorant about the simple way to add the additional switch configuration? Or does the modem not support VLAN tagging on the WAN?</p><p>The WAN is shown as etho.<br />Interfaces - WAN<br />Ethernet Adapter: &quot;eth0&quot; (wan, wan6) &lt;&lt;&lt; this one is checked<br />Ethernet Adapter: &quot;eth1&quot; (lan) <br />VLAN Interface: &quot;eth1.1&quot; <br />Wireless Network: Master &quot;OpenWrt&quot; (lan) <br />Custom Interface</p><p>Under network switch I find the following, which leaves me confused where WAN fits in the picture.</p><p>VLAN ID&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; CPU &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Port 1&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Port 2&nbsp; &nbsp; Port 3&nbsp; &nbsp; Port 4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br />Port status:1000baseTno link&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no link&nbsp; &nbsp; no link&nbsp; &nbsp; no link&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;full-duplex&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>I&#039;ve figured out that Port 1 and Port 2 are the two LAN ports on the router. CPU always shows 1000baseT. I connected the WAN port of the N150R router to a LAN output of the existing router connected to the modem, and I could access the Internet through the N150R router but I saw no change (WAN didn&#039;t show up) on the network switch page of the N150R web interface.</p>									</div>

					<p>Everything is there.<br />Usually routers have 1 or 2 ethernet adapters.<br />When router has 2 adapters, usually eth0 is connected to switch and serves as LAN, eth1 connected to WAN without switch.<br />Determine which physical adapter connects to WAN. You pretend it to be eth0. Are you sure ?</p><p>1) If you receive tagged traffic from eth not connected to switch - just change &quot;ethx&quot; to &quot;ethx.y&quot; and you get there only tagged traffic with vlan tag &quot;y&quot;.<br />2) If you receive tagged traffic from eth connected to switch then create switch_vlan with required id and make sure CPU and inbound ports are both configured as tagged for that VLAN and do the same as in 1)</p><p>example of connecting ISP with tagged traffic thru one of the switch ports :</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config switch
        option name &#039;switch0&#039;
        option reset &#039;1&#039;

config interface &#039;wan&#039;

# 2 - inbound port, 5 - cpu port
        option ports &#039;2t 5t&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Also configure additional vlan for LAN and configure its network interface properly or you cut yourself from the router.<br />Thats all the magic.

					<p>Yes, you can setup any custom name for physical interface. Type there &quot;eth0.201&quot;<br />Unknown protocol type must be caused by absense of &quot;proto&quot; option or invalid value there</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bolvan</strong> on 26 Oct 2016, 21:53)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m moving in the direction of thinking that my router hardware does not support VLAN tagging on the WAN. I think the problem might be that my WAN does not show up on my switch. I found a blog by Scott R McClure where he uses OpenWrt for CenturyLink fiber but it appears his WAN shows on his switch.</p><p>Don&#039;t know if this might help understand my router. I backed up my config using the web interface. Below is the contents of the network file. On my router I have a WAN port and 2 LAN ports. I think the router internally has 2 additional LAN ports that are not brought out for connection. The OpenWrt web interface for the switch shows a CPU and 4 ports. By experimenting I have been able to trace ports 1 and 2 to the LAN connectors on the router, and no change showing on any of the ports as I connect and disconnect to the WAN port. </p><p>config interface &#039;loopback&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;lo&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;127.0.0.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask &#039;255.0.0.0&#039;</p><p>config globals &#039;globals&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ula_prefix &#039;fd4a:89ce:330c::/48&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option force_link &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option type &#039;bridge&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;192.168.1.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ip6assign &#039;60&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;dhcp&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;wan6&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;dhcpv6&#039;</p><p>config switch<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option name &#039;switch0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option reset &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option enable_vlan &#039;1&#039;</p><p>config switch_vlan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;switch0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ports &#039;0 1 2 3 4&#039;</p>									</div>

					<p>Old thread, have you solved this? Background: I am trying to achieve a similar thing on a WRT1900ACS v1.</p><p>I don&#039;t think your WAN port is not showing, but you&#039;ll have to find out which of the 5 (0..4) ports actually belongs to WAN. Assuming it is port 0, try this...</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config switch
    option name &#039;switch0&#039;
    option reset &#039;1&#039;
    option enable_vlan &#039;1&#039;

config switch_vlan
    option device &#039;switch0&#039;
    option vlan &#039;1&#039;
    option ports &#039;1 2 3 4&#039;
    option vid &#039;1&#039;

config switch_vlan
    option device &#039;switch0&#039;
    option vlan &#039;2&#039;
    option ports &#039;0t&#039;
    option vid &#039;201&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Difference to your config is the &quot;vid&quot; line and the&nbsp; &quot;t&quot; so the WAN port will be tagged. Also, the LAN ports have been moved to a different VLAN (but they remain untagged).</p><p>Then also set the WAN interface to physical adapter eth0.201.</p><p>Note that probably WAN uses two ports (e.g. 0 and 3, one internal, one external) and LAN uses three ports (e.g. 1, 2 and 4, one internal, two external). Unfortunately I couldn&#039;t find a layout of how your hardware is mapped internally.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>floydburgermcdahm</strong> on 27 Jan 2017, 00:13)</p>

					<p>I never solved it. I&#039;ll probably try again sometime in the future, but the priority dropped as my 30 days to return the Century Link modem I was hoping to replace was running out, plus I read the fine print and decided I was authorized to return the Century Link modem within 30 days only if it was not working or I was quitting the Century Link Internet service.</p><p>The next thing I going to try was to edit a copy of the existing configuration file using a text editor, then replace the existing configuration file with the edited configuration file. I was going to try this in case my problem was the &quot;reduced-memory&quot; configuration of OpenWrt I was using didn&#039;t have a full-capability user interface and that was why I wasn&#039;t seeing the options to set up ID=201. If somebody has solved this, I would appreciate a post of the configuration file.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, I&#039;ll let you know once I have successfully tried the above lines in the network config file plus this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;wan&#039;

However, after I added the lines to the config file, it did show up in the user interface under Network -&gt; Switch.</p>									</div>
