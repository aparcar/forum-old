					<p>Hello</p><p>I maybe doing something silly. For the past one week I am trying to upload the Kamikaze build to my ASUS software. When I do the tftp I get the file transferred message correctly. But I cannot ping or telnet to the box on 192.168.1.1. I have done this many times before but now (after few months gap) I am just not able to do it. I even downloaded latest .trx file from openwrt and still samething. I will greatly appreciate any clues. I have three ASUS routers and it s same w/ all.</p><p>Thanks a lot in advance!!!</p><p>Yaadgiri</p>									</div>

					<p>I used 2.6 then 2.4 version. Used tftp on windows, ubuntu and restoration tool from ASUS. Yes I waited even couple of hours before rebooting. Right now, tried 7.06 version also. I am out of my wits on why it is not getting uploaded. Only change is that I am doing it from India now and there is a gap of about a month since I did it successfully when I was in USA. So I may be doing some silly mistake. <br />Pinging 192.168.1.1 with 32 bytes of data:</p><p>Destination host unreachable.<br />Destination host unreachable.</p><p>Ping statistics for 192.168.1.1:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Packets: Sent = 2, Received = 0, Lost = 2 (100% loss),<br />Control-C</p>									</div>

					<p>I found Kamikaze 7.0.9 (and possibly earlier) won&#039;t boot on a WL-500gPv2. I had the same issue, I reckon I tried every released version of Kamikaze and White Russian. Nothing worked. I finally managed to get hold of a USB serial adapter, and connected the console - I found the router was flashing just fine (only takes less than a minute after the tftp completes) but was simply hanging at boot.</p><p>As per the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Asus/WL500GPV2">wiki</a>, you need to apply various patches to get it to boot, and more if you want USB to work. (Aside: my great thanks go to MilesBintz for writing up the instructions in the wiki, and sbrown for creating the patches!)</p><p>I successfully built a 2.6 image from a recent SVN checkout, r12863,(some modules/packages failed to build, e.g. rt2x00, and couldn&#039;t be deselected in &#039;make menuconfig&#039;, so I had to manually fiddle with the .config). I&#039;ve uploaded my image and packages here:</p><p><a href="http://www.box.net/shared/r3y49b94el">openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx</a><br /><a href="http://www.box.net/shared/fmt8czv758">packages.tar</a></p><p>NOTE: this image was built per the wiki, but does not have the USB patches applied. And as you hopefully are aware, there is (and probably will never be due to closed nature of the Broadcom wifi?) no wireless support for the v2.</p><p>The box seems stable thus far - I ran openvpn --test-crypto in a loop for a few hours &quot;burnin&quot;, and it has been up as my home gateway for almost a week without incident.</p><p>BTW FrekoDing: the v1 and v2 devices are quite different, they really should have different model names.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>af3556</strong> on 10 Oct 2008, 01:14)</p>

					<p>I tried to upload the file from FrekoDing today using ASUS restoration tool but still same issue.. I can try others also tonight. First off, when I power up the modem in restore mode, I have to give static IP (192.168.1.100) to my laptop otherwise the modem does not assing an IP to the laptop in DHCP. I have used the static IP before successfully to upload the .trx file. I think static IP may not be an issue. I will go through other valuable suggestions from this posting and see if I can get it to work tonight.</p>									</div>
