					<p>I am currently using r36828, since the wired networking is not currently operating in the current revisions of trunk at time of writing this.</p><p>Here is <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/13869">the ticket for this</a>. <strong>Update: fixed</strong></p><p>Also, failsafe does not listen to the network nodes, even though it is activated (only tested on r36828, though); <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/13868">here&#039;s the ticket</a>. <strong>Update: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/37286">fixed</a> :-)</strong></p><br /><p>And a more general status update follows (updated from <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=201025#p201025">this</a> post)...</p><p>This router is currently working with OpenWrt, with an &quot;alpha&quot; quality (in other words, most, *but not all*, features are operating (correctly)).</p><p>For now you can use the <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/">snapshot images</a>, or if you want to leave enough space for the Luci web-interface, a custom build or an image from the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtain.firmware.generate">Image Generator</a> (and it seems that you should choose something similar to <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/target/linux/brcm47xx/profiles/220-Broadcom-bgmac-b43.mk">Broadcom-bgmac-b43</a>. The only customizing needed is&nbsp; setting (the profile) to include only the &quot;bgmac&quot; wired network support, since that is the only one this device requires. (This also frees up more space, currently, by not including wireless drivers for older devices which do not use the bgmac drivers (b43legacy)).</p><p>To start off: Here are some issues found so far (testing on E1000)...<br />&nbsp; - On current trunk <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/">snapshots</a>, Luci cannot be installed (using &quot;luci&quot; package), since there is not enough free space on the router.<br />Possible solutions: Select &quot;bgmac&quot; ethernet driver profile in image builder or source build; Compile a custom image with unneeded code removed; Install only Luci dependencies which are absolutely required; add code to &quot;trunk&quot; to generate a custom image <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtain.firmware.generate#profiles">profile</a> for the device(s) with any unneeded items removed<br />&nbsp; - Possible issues with wired networking when wireless is enabled -- this should be fixed now (with <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=199991#p199991">this fix</a>), but I may have seen this problem in more recent builds) <strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/37286/">fixed!</a><br />Possible solutions: compile with older revision from soon after GPIO fix was applied<br />&nbsp; - The &quot;.bin&quot;&nbsp; <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/brcm47xx/openwrt-e1000_v1_v2-squashfs.bin">image</a> for the E1000 is rejected by the stock web-interface on older images. <strong>This may be fixed</strong> by now though!<br />Possible solutions: fix the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/header">BIN</a> file generated; it seems this might be fixed by editing <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/target/linux/brcm47xx/image/Makefile">this file</a>.<br />&nbsp; - Multiple (simultaneous) SSIDs in AP mode are not working for me, when I enable one of them, then both don&#039;t work. I am sure that the hardware can support this (&quot;software interface modes (can always be added):\n\t* AP/VLAN)&quot;, though I do not know for a fact; with DD-WRT I was able to have an AP and client simultaneously. (See also <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/592296/using-iw-to-add-a-virtual-wireless-interface-getting-the-error-no-such-device">this</a>.) Here is the relevant output from &quot;iw list&quot;:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>    Supported interface modes:
         * IBSS
         * managed
         * AP

					<p>Sorry if I missed it, I did try searching.&nbsp; I have a WRT160N v3, and I just flashed openwrt-15.05-brcm47xx-mips74k-linksys-wrt160n-v3-squashfs.bin&nbsp; (from Tomato) and it still only seems to support g, not n speeds.&nbsp; Is it still not possible, or can someone point me to either an alternate image or instructions for how to do it?&nbsp; I&#039;d rather not compile my own image, although it&#039;s certainly an option.</p><p>Thanks for any pointers.</p>									</div>

					<p>All the documentation for the E1000v2 says you need to use the serial connection, but I was able to use the oob firmware update utility to install dd-wrt (dd-wrt.v24-16758_NEWD-2_K2.6_mini_e1000v2.bin).&nbsp; After that, I was able to flash the firmware with the latest openwrt without using the serial connection.</p>									</div>
