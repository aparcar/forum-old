					<p># The problem described here applies to trunk r28063.<br /># I don&#039;t know how long the problem has been sitting around.</p><p>I have a problem with flashing the Buffalo WZR-HP-AG300H with W25Q128, and want to share my experience with rest of the community.</p><p>The W25Q128 device has basic (?) erase size of 64K, but it is flagged with SECT_4K in drivers/mtd/devices/m25p80.c, and as a result, the device is recognized as having 4K erase size in the kernel. On the other hand, the target/linux/ar71xx/image/Makefile generates jffs2 based root file system assuming 64K erase size for the AG300H. (Originally, it was 128K, but I have modified it to match what the uboot message said about the erase size.)</p><p>This mismatch will result in the &quot;Node at &lt;offset&gt; with length &lt;node size&gt; would run over the end of the erase block&quot; errors in the jffs2 initialization process, which is quite natural, and eventually ending up with kernel panic on not been able to mount the root file system.</p><p>I tried to generate the jffs2 root fs by selecting the fs_4K in the image/Makefile, but the build process just did not generate ANY jffs2 file system image for this parameter.</p><p>In practice, I can still use the squashfs+jffs2 approach because the jffs2 overlay partition is initialized assuming 4K erase blocks during the boot process.</p><p>There seems to be no quick fix for this problem, except for disabling generation of jffs2 root fs in the image/Makefile for targets having OPCODE_BE_4K flashes , or generate jffs2 with 4K (fs_4k).</p><p>jffs2-based root fs doesn&#039;t work with OPCODE_BE_4K capable flash?</p>									</div>
