					<p>Greetings!</p><p>After sysupgrade of a couple of TP-Link TL-WA901N/ND to the latest trunk (r37018, 24 June) I have same issue on all of them: they boot in failsafe mode by default.</p><p>The only way I discovered to boot them in the normal mode is pressing &quot;reset&quot; button while booting for about 10-15 sec.</p><p>1) Tried to compare dmesg and logs from the other 3 AP with old OpenWRt build - there is no difference.<br/>2) Tried to tcpdump traffic - no udp traffic at all when booting AP (seems to be some scripting issue during preinit).<br/>3) Partially checked preinit scripts for mistakes in logic - didn&#039;t find anything - all logic works as expected.<br/>4) Checked some timeline tickets for about 1 week on dev.openwrt.org.</p><br/><p>Can somebody help me? Should I post some additional info?</p><br/><p>Sorry for my English <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad"/></p>									</div>

 BARRIER BREAKER (Bleeding Edge, r37660)                                        </code></pre></div><p>As you can see, it thinks I pressed the wps button, I assure you I did not. Seems to me as if the button config is wrong in the latest trunk. Just to trick it (in case of on/off mistake) I keep it pressed during boot, but it still went to failsafe.</p><p>Before I was always using an old 10.03.1 trunk to satisfaction, except coova-chilli was getting old. When I upgraded to 10.06 stable, OpenWRT did not communicate if both an LAN *and* WAN cable was attached during boot (worked WAN was disconnected and then connected later. Probably some switch config problem)</p><p>So I upgraded to latest trunk, r37660, and now it always goes to failsafe.</p><p>Any thoughts? <br/>I&#039;ll probably try to figure out how to downgrade with tftp or something, but if some of the dev&#039;s could look at the TP-LINK failsafe button config, that would be great. </p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Hmm, so r37619 works on TP-LINK WA901ND, but later r37660 fails for WR941ND</p><p>So either the issues were not related, or worse, the button reconfig done for your model broke mine.</p>									</div>

					<p>cybermaus, on my WR941ND the system seems to be booting ok on Barrier Breaker r37801. I just updated my firmware, so I am not sure if mine would have the same problem you had with earlier builds.</p>									</div>
