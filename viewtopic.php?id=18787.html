ARP requests bypass through are just a technical detail which is completly transparent and useless for the user. If you got OpenWRT in routed mode, which i uses to prefeer because it&#039;s simplier to understand and diagnose, things would work the same way. The fact ARP requests wont pass from one side to the other simply doesnt care at all.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>AlfaGulf wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>The user might bypass my filter by:<br />1.

There&#039;s a lot of Tomcat using this port. But as they are real HTTP, they can be simply forwarded to squid (not dansguardian, keep that in mind) and it should work. The problem would be non-HTTP things running on ports that you transparently intercept. That would probably give you some headaches.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>AlfaGulf wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>2,&nbsp; Accessing a HTTPS site, In this case I need to find a solution to (hopefully) redirect it to dansguardian or at least reply with an error message asking the user to set his browser proxy field to point at my dansguardian (Bridge IP)</p><p> Of course, there other ways to bypass the filter, but I am working on them one at a time, hoping that I can close as much gaps as possible.</p></blockquote></div><p>you can bring a HTTPS server on OpenWRT and put your instructions on how to setup proxy there. Anyway, you&#039;ll have problems. User will try to access <a href="http://www.hisbank.com">www.hisbank.com</a> and will get a browser warning because even you have a https certificate, it&#039;s not &#039;<a href="http://www.whatever.com">www.whatever.com</a>&#039; user is trying to access. I think issuing your https certificate with &#039;*&#039; as common name would half-solve the problem, the hostname one. But browsers would complain because that certificate is not signed by some real certificates issuer. And, of course, no one would sign your * wildcard certificate.</p><p>So, i think there&#039;s no way of COMPLETLY and transparently intercepting HTTPS without having browsers warning.</p><p>And as 8080, you will get a LOT of non-https traffic hitting your https server. Skype and P2P, for example, likes to use 443 port.</p><p>and .... finally but not last, asking user to configure proxy on its browser just through way all the bridge mode advantages, which is get the traffic filter by a device no one knows exists. It can even have no ip address on the network and still get the filtering working. But if you need your users to configure proxy, they will know the ip address of the filtering device, which ends with the great &#039;stealth&#039; advantage of bridged mode.</p><br /><p>My hint ...... forget about bridged mode and go for routed. It&#039;s simplier to understand and debug problems.</p><p>get squid running and look for the session external ACL.</p><p><a href="http://linuxreviews.org/man/squid_session/">http://linuxreviews.org/man/squid_session/</a></p><p>get some page, called by session, to show the &#039;how to configure proxy instructions&#039;. Simply forget about https interception ....... users will most probably use some normal http site when open their browser, and thus receive the &#039;how to configure&#039; screen. Another tip: instead of specifying ip/port, you should use some wpad.dat/proxy.pac script, which can be hosted by OpenWRT with any of the lightweight http daemons (the same one which will probably hold the how to configure instructions). With wpad.dat/proxy.pac, you can create exceptions on the script without the need for changing browser settings.</p><p>and, when users configure script for getting normal http through your proxy, they will have https forwarded there as well.</p><p>and about the blocking sites, proxy ones for example&nbsp; ........ well, that&#039;s a battle you&#039;ll NEVER win. Your users will always be one step further than your blockings. But there&#039;s no magic way on that ......... </p><p>if i were you, i would completly forget about the https interception. That&#039;s relatively easy to do with squid 3.1 (which there&#039;s no ready Makefile for OpenWRT, you would have to do it), but has the drawbacks that showing warnings to users. Not to count if you got some experienced user and he figures out that you&#039;re having access to its decripted banking traffic (passwords, codes, etc etc) ..... that would give you headaches <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>leonardogyn</strong> on 9 Feb 2009, 00:45)</p>

					<p>squid 2.6 STABLE14, the one that is ready on OpenWRT packages, already has the session external acl !!! Altough, it&#039;s not enabled on OpenWRT squid package, you would have to mungle feeds/packages/net/squid/Makefile to build and make a package for that.</p><p>Anyway, believe me ....... that would be MUCH EASIER than getting 3.1 built as your initial desire was.</p>									</div>
