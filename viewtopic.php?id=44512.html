					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;ve been using a TL-WR1043ND router with Backfire 10.03.1 for a couple of years now. Recently my router just stopped working. So I bought a brand new TL-WDR4300, and flashed it with Attitude Adjustment 12.09. Everything seems to be fine, but I just can&#039;t make extroot work.</p><p>I&#039;ve formatted the hardrive, copied /overlay to it, and added an entry in /etc/config/fstab according to the wiki. Exactly the same thing I did with my previous router with Backfire (the only difference is now the absence of is_rootfs option in fstab).</p><p>When I try pivot overlay method, my drive gets mounted to /tmp/overlay-disabled.<br />When I try pivot root method, my drive gests mounted to /tmp/whole_root-disabled.</p><p>I am not an expert on OpenWrt but I think that my drive is being mount too late on the boot process. I&#039;ve managed to log the output of mount, just before my drive gets automatically mounted in the boot process. Here is the output:</p><p>rootfs on / type rootfs (rw)<br />/dev/root on /rom type squashfs (ro,relatime)<br />proc on /proc type proc (rw,noatime)<br />sysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw,noatime)<br />tmpfs on /tmp type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noatime,size=63340k)<br />tmpfs on /dev type tmpfs (rw,noatime,size=512k,mode=755)<br />devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,noatime,mode=600)<br />/dev/mtdblock3 on /overlay type jffs2 (rw,noatime)<br />overlayfs:/overlay on / type overlayfs (rw,relatime,lowerdir=/,upperdir=/overlay)<br />debugfs on /sys/kernel/debug type debugfs (rw,relatime)<br />none on /proc/bus/usb type usbfs (rw,relatime)</p><p>As you can see, the overlayfs has already been created with jffs2.</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>									</div>

					<p>After reading the documentation, I found out that preinit is responsible for mounting the file system (including the extroot stuff). And that is run long before fstab. So I guess that something is wrong with those preinit scripts.</p><p>I want to add some logs to see what&#039;s going on, but how can I change those scripts? I ask this because modifying /lib/preinit/60_pivot_usb_root for example won&#039;t have any effect upon reboot, since during boot the overlay hasn&#039;t been mounted at this point. Should I mount /dev/root as read-write, and modify it there? How safe is that? I am scared of bricking the router.</p><p>Another question is, how do I check for logs from preinit scripts? The script /lib/preinit/10_indicate_preinit logs some stuff, like &quot;- preinit -&quot; and &quot;Doing OpenWRT Preinit\n&quot;, but I don&#039;t see them with dmesg or logread.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, after breaking my head for a while with this problem, I decided to test extroot with a spare pendrive that I have here. Plugged in, created the partition with fdisk, and formatted with mkfs.ext4. Mounted it onto /mnt, and copied /overlay to it. Edited fstab to create extroot with the pendrive and rebooted. Damn, it worked.</p><p>So I did exactly the same steps with my hard drive, but it is still not working. It is still being mounted onto /tmp/overlay-disabled. This exactly same hard drive, and same usb case was working fine with TL-WR1043ND and Backfire 10.03.1, so I think there is nothing wrong with it. I don&#039;t have a spare hard drive to test if this problem occurs only with spinning drives.</p><p>Does anyone have any idea what the problem is?</p><p>Since this router has 2 usb ports, I can use the pendrive as a system partition, and the hard drive as a data partition. But I really don&#039;t want to do that. I would use this solution only if I can&#039;t fix the hard drive problem.</p>									</div>

I already read that, and I though that wouldn&#039;t work with extroot. My understanding of how openwrt works, is that /etc/init.d/fstab is run from the fstab service, and that is run after preinit has finished. But extroot is to be mounted during preinit. Given that, I think that topic on the wiki applies only to normal mounting, when fstab is run (does not apply to extroot).</p><p>I believe the script that mounts extroot is /lib/preinit/50_determine_usb_root. It has code similar to the one you posted (config_load fstab; config_foreach config_mount_by_section). But I can&#039;t make changes to it because it is run from the read-only partition.</p><p>Anyways, I gave it a shot, and it doesn&#039;t work.</p>									</div>

					<p>So, after examining the code on /lib/preinit/50_determine_usb_root, I&#039;ve seen that it sleeps a while before trying to mount my hard drive. The amount of time it sleeps is defined by a variable called $extroot_settle_time. I&#039;ve searched for it, and found out that it&#039;s defined in the file /lib/preinit/00_extroot.conf. I changed it for 5 minutes (300). My router took more than 5 minutes to reboot (so that change actually worked), but my hard drive is still no being mount as extroot.</p><p>I have no idea what to try next.</p>									</div>
