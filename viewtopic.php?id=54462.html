					<p>Hello everybody,</p><p>there&#039;s a problem I am experiencing every couple of days now.<br />My router does not resolve DNS anymore and neither my PC or laptop or smart phone can access any domains from within my network. However, using IPs for certain sites works fine.<br />After I reboot the router, everything is fine again for the next days.</p><p>I am running OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment 12.09 on a TPLink WDR3600 with the following additional changes:<br />- additional USB flash drive is connected to provide storage for SMB and FTP<br />- SMB service is running to access USB storage<br />- proFTPd is running to receive security cam uploads from my parents (several 1000 JPEGs a day)<br />- DynDNS service is running</p><p>Any suggestions what could cause this problem?<br />Unfortunately I forgot to test if the router itself can still resolve DNS before I rebooted it this morning.</p><p>Any hints are really appreciated.<br />Thanks in advance and best regards from Germany!</p><p>Thomas</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi </p><p>It could be a memory issue how much ram is left when this happens.</p><p>Maybe cache issus as openwrt clears dns cach on reboot.</p><p>Have a read of <a href="http://flux242.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/dnsmasq-cache-size-tuning.html?m=1">http://flux242.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/d â€¦ g.html?m=1</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the quick answer.</p><p>RAM should not be a problem, There&#039;s still enough free memory when the problem occurs.<br />I will check the cache settings when I come home.</p><p>As a first solution I disabled the DNS prefetch in my browsers.</p>									</div>

					<p>You could schedule a reboot every night, for example. That would be a very quick and dirty solution.<br />I&#039;ll leave the logrotation to someone else, I don&#039;t even know if there&#039;s a package for that and I&#039;m too lazy to check <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p><p>For nightly reboots, go to System-&gt;Scheduled tasks and add the following:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>30    4    *    *    *    /sbin/reboot</code></pre></div>									</div>

					<p>Thanks everybody for their help.<br />I downloaded and configured logrotate on my router and set up a cronjob to run at 3am every night:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>0 3 * * * logrotate -f -s /tmp/logrotate.status /etc/logrotate.conf</code></pre></div><p>The two log files that grew so large every few days and occupied the entire tmp partition were added to the logrotate.conf file.<br />This seems to solve my problem very well.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>th0maz</strong> on 26 Dec 2014, 14:56)</p>
