					<p>@gufus, Just an FYI: LEDE <a href="https://forum.lede-project.org/">forum</a>, <a href="https://bugs.lede-project.org/">bugs</a>, <a href="https://wiki.lede-project.org/">wiki</a>. On another note I was wondering if your mamba fan procd stuff is in a git somewhere? LEDE has <a href="https://forum.lede-project.org/t/rebuilding-images-from-the-buildroot-without-packaging-the-image-generator/161">this</a> and it would be nice to have seperate images for mamba and the rest, so as to deal with the fan anomaly.</p>									</div>
