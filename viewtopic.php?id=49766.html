					<p>Hi Everyone,<br />I&#039;m looking to buy an OpenWRT-capable router to replace the stock one from my ISP as the firmware&#039;s rubbish.<br />Specifically, I need an ethernet router supporting PPPoE, with a 4-port switch. However, I *dont* want one with a wireless access point (I&#039;ve already got a separate one).&nbsp; The closest thing I&#039;ve found so far is the <a href="http://uk.tp-link.com/products/details/?categoryid=228&amp;model=TL-R460">TP-Link TL-R460</a>, but this lacks OpenWRT support. Can anyone suggest a router that matches what I&#039;m after?</p><p>Many thanks<br />Mark</p>									</div>

					<p>Nope, just an AP with 1 ethernet port.</p><p>Looking again at the hardware comaptibility list, I can see that pretty much all the devices listed from major vendors have a wireless NIC, so perhaps I&#039;m misguided and should just get one with WiFi and turn it off unless I find that I need it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>marxjohnson</strong> on 28 Mar 2014, 13:53)</p>

					<p>I think that would be the best bet. I&#039;m very impressed with the WD My Net N750 at the moment and you can get them bloody cheap. I bought one for AUD$49 in Aus.</p>									</div>

					<p>Buy one with a wifi, and disable the wifi. TP-Link devices like WDR-4300 and ArcherC7 have a physical switch on the back that turns off wifi. Beyond that, and you don&#039;t have to screw in the external antennas.</p><p>Or you can do the smarter thing and disable the wifi on your modem, which your service provider is probably using parasitically to steal your power and network bandwidth to share it with your neighbors.</p>									</div>
