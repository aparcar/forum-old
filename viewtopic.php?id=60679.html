					<p>Oh it&#039;s a lantiq based device, and you&#039;re trying to get openwrt trunk running, and have serial access, and the device uses uboot.</p><p>That&#039;s a very good start, you can pretty much boot anything you like on it in that case, as long as you don&#039;t accidentally overwrite uboot in which case you&#039;d need an spi programmer.</p><p>Describe in more detail the steps you took to &quot;brick&quot; it, and how does it behave now?</p>									</div>
