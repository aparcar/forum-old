					<p>I&#039;ve configured my Linksys with X-Wrt: static WAN IP address like 1.2.3.106/24, LAN address 192.168.255.0/24. It does NAT well, and I have some firewall rules configured via X-WRT which connect public address ports (80, 25, ...) to my servers&#039; LAN addresses.</p><p>But when I try to connect from the inside (LAN) to my external address (1.2.3.106), e.g., with a web browser or telnet session, I get the OpenWRT X-WRT web server. </p><p>I suspect there&#039;s some default IPtable rule which is intercepting connections from the LAN instead of forwarding them to the WAN interface so they&#039;ll &quot;come back in&quot; and get mapped by NAT back to my internal addresses.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t know iptables well at all and I haven&#039;t found similar discussions in this forum or other searches. </p><p>Any clues? Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have to say that I switched from OpenWRT to Tomato firmware and that problem disappeared. I think I subsequently read of some config setting that might have fixed this, but never went back to try it. </p><p>Tomato also allowed me to use my 20/5Mbps FIOS link at full speed, instead of the 10% that OpenWRT gave me.&nbsp; And it&#039;s an integrated solution, which I prefer to OpenWRT&#039;s split between code and web UI.</p><p>Don&#039;t mean to sound like I&#039;m bashing OpenWRT, I&#039;ve used it happily for quite a while. I just found Tomato easier/better for my needs and now run it on my 4 Linksys routers.</p>									</div>
