					<p>Hi,</p><p>Whilst I have a fully functional network using OLSRD I am looking to move to OSPF and so have been trying to compile Quagga without success.&nbsp; I am more sysadmin than programmer so have been following instructions on this forum (http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=31794#p31794 and <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=45838)">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=45838)</a> without success.&nbsp; I keep getting the following failure:</p><p>$ make package/quagga compile V=99<br />make -C package quagga<br />make[1]: Entering directory `/scratch/openwrt/kamikaze_7.09/package&#039;<br />make[1]: `quagga&#039; is up to date.<br />make[1]: Leaving directory `/scratch/openwrt/kamikaze_7.09/package&#039;<br />make: *** No rule to make target `compile&#039;.&nbsp; Stop.</p><p>I have tried with both Kamikaze 7.09 and trunk.&nbsp; My OS is Debian Sid.&nbsp; </p><p>I assume there is some general problem with Quagga as there is no ipkg package available and I found the following post (<a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=13143">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=13143</a>) asking for it to be ported.</p><p>So two questions.&nbsp; First can anyone advise on getting Kamikaze to compile?&nbsp; And second what is the issue that prevents its inclusion as an ipkg package?</p><p>Thanks for any replies,</p><p>Gary</p>									</div>

					<p>There is no need to recompile quagga as it has been done already. 7.09 does not include the package due to a minor regression following the renaming of the readline dependency package - see <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=12796">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=12796</a> for more details.
