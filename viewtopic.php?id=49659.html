					<p>Hello,</p><p>I recently got a 24dB grid antenna and got to scanning around. I found a WISP here in my town and its Open and Unsecured. The AP shows up and when im trying to connect it doesn&#039;t assigning an IP Address. The AP is unsecure and open but afaik it doesn&#039;t issue an IP via DHCP.</p><p>I was able to somewhat get onto the AP by setting up a static IP I got from Wireshark capture but wasn&#039;t able to get connected to the internet.</p><p>I tried to setup my dlink router with ddwrt in it and set into wireless client bridge mode and got connected but the problem is I still cant get any information to connect to the internet.</p><p>Can someone give me an ideas?</p><p>Thank you and more power</p>									</div>

					<p>im just curious why i cant connect to the internet since it is an open network and all client cpe&#039;s are connected to it, i already hacked the 12dbi antenna&nbsp; and opened it and what i found is a regular router in it but i cant open the configuration of the router, because i think it is ip filtered,&nbsp; i cant afford to subscribe to their service because its very expensive,&nbsp; thats why im trying to bypass their internet connection for free, it will be a great appreciation if someone will help me how to do this,<br />thank you</p>									</div>
