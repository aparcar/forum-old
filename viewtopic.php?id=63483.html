					<p>Info on backing up and restoring ART partition (just one of multiple flash partitions), and on flash partitions:</p><p><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/restore_art_partition">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/rest … _partition</a></p><p><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/flash.layout">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/flash.layout</a></p><p>You will have to read and study these pages as well as others you need while you&#039;re in the process of learning how to fix your problem.&nbsp; Most experienced users are not willing to hold your hand every step of the way while you work on this.&nbsp; Being patient, reading, studying and learning is the most important thing in solving a problem like this.&nbsp; Please be diligent!&nbsp; Take the time and effort necessary.</p><p>Since you didn&#039;t make a backup you&#039;ll have to ask for someone else who uses a TP-Link WR1043ND v2.1 router to make backups of the partitions and post or e-mail them to you.&nbsp; I recommend starting a new thread.&nbsp; Please ask politely <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />&nbsp; Explain that you need flash partition backups for this model and version router.&nbsp; Hopefully someone with the necessary experience will take the time to help you.</p><p>Then you need additional understanding or help.&nbsp; At the very least you need to reset the MAC address(es) in the ART partition backup image to agree with your router&#039;s factory settings.&nbsp; Once modified to work on your router -- which may be difficult or involve some small amount of guesswork -- you need to upload and flash.&nbsp; Follow the documentation.&nbsp; Just restoring the ART partition may fix your problem.&nbsp; Or perhaps some of the u-boot and its environment flash memory is corrupted, too.&nbsp; That is probably more complicated to fix???&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure how to flash those to the proper memory locations.&nbsp; I&#039;m out of my league here.</p><p>You might also politely ask for partition backups for your model/version on the dd-wrt Atheros board.&nbsp; There are real experts who follow that project, too.</p><p>Remember, I&#039;m not a flash memory or device expert.&nbsp; I&#039;m just helping you as best I understand.&nbsp; There may be another way to correct things because I don&#039;t understand the problem fully.&nbsp; Sorry I can&#039;t be of more help.&nbsp; If no one with more experience than me replies on the boards or the IRC channel, you&#039;re on your own <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /></p><p>Clemmitt</p>									</div>
