					<p>Okay so I have an Edimax router on which I have installed OpenWrt. I plugged my deskdtop into the router then I plugged the router in to my Mediacom modem (SMC D3CM1604) and, presto, I have internet. Piece of cake. Didn&#039;t have to lift a finger after the install. Now, I would like to enable wifi so I can use my laptop, smart TV, etc. This is where I am having difficulties. Here is what I have tried so far (Using LuCI web interface):</p><p>Network&gt; WiFi&gt; Enable radio0... (apply config but signal strength is 0). Try to edit config for this radio in Network&gt;WiFi&gt;Edit by adding (bridging) other networks (lan, wan, wan6) but to no avail. Adjust transmit strengths, change frequency but nothing results in signal output.</p><p>I have also tinkered with the interface settings and was able to connect to wifi but without internet. </p><p>Anyway, I don&#039;t really know what I am doing. Tutorials haven&#039;t been of much help because I can&#039;t seem to find one that is attempting the same configuration. Any advice?</p>									</div>
