					<p>I thought about setting up a carddav/caldav server on my OpenWRT installation. Privacy and stuff <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>So my first thought was to try OwnCloud, which is way too much for a router.<br />From what I read there are davical and radical. Both are not available as packages.</p><p>Since I didn&#039;t find any information about davical I downloaded radicale and tried to run it. The setup file crashes with an error on openssl, someone wrote it in this forum before.</p><p>Can someone help me? Are there other servers which actually work?</p>									</div>

					<p>0.6.3 seems outdated, but I don&#039;t mind. As you say, it could be a start.<br />So, I actually see a diff and two patch files.</p><p>How do I install this? I guess not via opkg..

					<p>Thank you a lot.</p><p>I just checked out the sources, but there is no feeds directory. Also it seems like I need to compile the whole thing to get it up and running, but I&#039;m building it on Debian in a VM (x86). So I have to cross-compile?</p><p>Configuration is not a problem for me, once the binary runs.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ah, I sort of assumed you&#039;d build openwrt from source, just like I do.<br />That&#039;s probably a bit less common, now I think of it.</p><p>It&#039;d be quite a hassle if you&#039;d do that just for one (python) package:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/easy.build">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/easy.build</a></p><p>You could look at the setup.py that&#039;s part of the radicale .zip file.<br />It&#039;s probably the &#039;import radicale&#039; in there that gives problems.<br />Remove that, and define the version by hand as in:<br />VERSION = &quot;0.8&quot;</p><p>Then try a <br />python setup.py install</p><p>you need the &#039;python&#039; and &#039;openssl&#039; packages installed using opkg.<br />You might need &#039;pyopenssl&#039; as well.</p>									</div>

					<p>Mmm, weird. I don&#039;t really know what&#039;s going on there. For some reason, on my router &quot;import ssl&quot; works just fine, so I must have done something different.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m interested in solving this, but yesterday I ordered a Synology NAS. It will host OwnCloud, so it will provide a Cardddav/Caldav server. This will be easier..</p><p>Thank you anyway.</p><p>Edit:<br />Got my NAS today. It&#039;s awesome and hosts ownCloud.<br />At first I wanted to play around with OpenWRT and Radicale, but I got lazy.
