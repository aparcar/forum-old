					<p>So, I&#039;m using a cheap VPN&nbsp; service&nbsp; (Private Internet Access) in my new apartment with my new 100mbps connection and I need a new wireless router. Before I used an old x86 machine running freebsd + opnevpn client and used an old WRT54G as a wireless access point but with the new connection I won&#039;t get more than 20 mbps out of it (the router) so I need a new setup. The reason I don&#039;t want to use my old x86 machine anymore is power consumption. I don&#039;t know exactly how much power it consumes but if I assume 150wat (which I think is realistic) I would be paying over 300 Euros a year in electricity for it.</p><p>So the question is: Is it possible to get a stable 100mbps encrypted VPN connection running on a router that won&#039;t cost me more than 100 euros or is the processor simply not going to be able to handle it? And if it&#039;s possible which router would you recommend?</p>									</div>

					<p>100 Euro, 100 Mbits over VPN, answer is NO. Why dont you increase your budget since you will be saving&nbsp; 300 Euros every year on your electricity bill by switching to a router capable of hitting close to 100 Mbits over VPN. The router will only cost you one time.</p>									</div>

					<p>it depends on what type of VPN and cipher you will be using. WDR7500 would aproximate 40 Mb/s using PPTP, or IPSec. Cut this into half if you want to use openvpn.</p>									</div>
