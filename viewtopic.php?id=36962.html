					<p>I have a fonero unit that on which I have booted OpenWRT and used successfully as gateway router. </p><p>I want to now use it as a gateway off&nbsp; a local WiFi service. The downstream side is then connected to a conventional 100bT WAN router with downsteram side hub and WiFi AP (eg a cheapo Belkin unit).</p><p>So I need to do this:</p><p>WAN-side: port ath0 (WiFi, operating as client, auto-channel sensing but connecting to specific SSID; DHCP client when up to get IP address etc)<br />(got a nice antenna for this side - I think that it gives 21dBi...)</p><p>LAN-side: port eth0 (100bT, operating as gateway on address 192.168.0.1/24, DHCP server starting at 192.168.0.10)</p><p>Routing: whatever, per usual ISP access gateway router (RIP or whatever) - but without static routes because of the DHCP on the WAN side (router addressed through 192.168.0.1)</p><p>No bridging, firewall or filtering necessary. The firewall is in the downstream access router. </p><p>I&#039;m proposing to use this 2-hop approach because I cant have the downstream access router doing upstream DHCP - becuase then I cant get into the fonero as the address is always changing...</p><p>My questions<br />1. How do I designate ath0 as the WAN port?<br />2. How do I get (a) ath0 to DHCP AND be a client AND (b) get eth0 to DHCP AND be a server.</p><p>Any help greatly appreciated.<br />Thanks<br />Nick</p><br /><br /><p>Firewall:</p>									</div>
