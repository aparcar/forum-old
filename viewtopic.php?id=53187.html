					<p>Hi, first of all, thanks for helping. </p><p>I am still somewhat new to this, so after having tried everything I found on forums and the like I am forced to ask here: </p><p>I want to open a port for P2P connections like torrents. I have tried several alternatives, one by one and all at once, and I have not gotten results. </p><p>Programs like utorrent tell me I have the port closed, I thought that things could be my pc&#039;s firewall, so I also looked at sites like this: <a href="http://www.whatsmyip.org/port-scanner/">http://www.whatsmyip.org/port-scanner/</a> <br />Result: closed. </p><p>I have a &quot;tp-link WR1043ND&quot; with &quot;Attitude Adjustment OpenWrt 12.09-rc1&quot;. </p><p>Thank you very much for your help!</p>									</div>
