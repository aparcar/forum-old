					<p>Really great! Exactly that kind of stats i was searching for!</p><p>But one thing I would advise you to change as fast as possible: Change the location of the file where the data is stored to somewhere in /tmp. Maybe you could run a second httpd on a different port with its document directory to /tmp/www or so.<br />The flash of the wrt54g supports only a limited number of write processes .. if you do this to often (and, hey: you do this every 5 minutes if I understood you correctly), your box will be crunched in a few weeks or months.<br />Better write it to /tmp. That&#039;s the RAM and as the guys on #wrt54g at freenode told me, there&#039;s no limited number of writings.</p><p>It would be nice if you could post this howto. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Another good SNMP graphing tool that I like is Cacti (also rrd based). Here are the network interface graphs I started using the snmpd:</p><p><a href="http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net/cacti/graph_view.php?action=tree&amp;tree_id=1&amp;leaf_id=9">http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net/cacti/gra … ;leaf_id=9</a></p><p>I wonder how much extra size is added by just turning on the &quot;scripts&quot;? I think that is the one that I want turned on. I could then write scripts and define my own OIDs right in the snmpd.conf that could get the memory/loadavg stuff. Then you can continue to use snmpd to get your load average and memory stats which should make life a little easier. If not I can create Cacti scripts that would grab the data from a URL like your workaround. I used to create a lot of my own OIDs and tie them to script output but it&#039;s not turned on in the snmpd that was in the ipkg. I guess I&#039;ll have to take the Makefile and see if I can get one compiled with script support.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>The ipkg listed in this thread is minimalized as mentioned so this functionality isn&#039;t built in to it. I did just take the netsnmp.mk and modified it slightly and got the 2021 stuff to display. It did make snmpd much larger (went from like 80k to 600k). I didn&#039;t get the scripting capability as I hoped though. I&#039;ll have to play around with it when I get home (at work right now). The line I changed before making went from:</p><p>--with-out-mib-modules=&quot;snmpv3mibs notification target utilities agent_mibs agentx utilities/execute&quot; </p><p>to </p><p>--with-out-mib-modules=&quot;snmpv3mibs notification target utilities agent_mibs agentx&quot; </p><p>What I was hoping to achieve was being able to have snmpd execute scripts and return the result through an OID but this did not do it. There are examples in the included snmpd.conf file in the ipkg for how it is &quot;supposed&quot; to work for script execution. Again, I&#039;ll have to play around tonight and see if I can figure it out.</p>									</div>

The &quot;netsnmp.mk&quot; file linked to earlier in this thread is not the one that comes with the current b4 distribution. It&#039;s for the newer version of net-snmp. It&#039;s set to build a static binary where the default netsnmp.mk file is set to build a shared version, which is how the ipkg is built. The ipkg comes with all the libraries where the 600k snmpd file I built didn&#039;t require any libraries. I don&#039;t believe the running size is a lot different than the shared version.</p><p>I went ahead and built net-snmp with the netsnmp.mk included with b4 and it does build bigger than the what is included in the ipkg but all the other stuff works (the scripts, the load avg, memory OIDs etc). I install on NFS so it&#039;s not that big of a deal space wise for me but obviously I am limited in the amount of RAM. At any rate I don&#039;t think I&#039;m quite ready for an ipkg until I can get things trimmed down. </p><p>Who built the ipkg linked to in this thread and would they still have their netsnmp.mk file? It would be nice to know what configure options were used and it would probably be a good starting point. Here&#039;s the last one I used that comes with b4 (I just turned off ssl):</p><p><a href="http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net/files/misc/netsnmp.mk">http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net/files/misc/netsnmp.mk</a></p><p>The net-snmp_5.1-5.diff.gz was a little tricky to find as it seems to be outdated but here&#039;s were I found a copy:<br /><a href="http://linux.org.by/debian/pool/main/n/net-snmp/">http://linux.org.by/debian/pool/main/n/net-snmp/</a></p><p>Of course 5.1.1 is probably just as good or better to use.</p>									</div>

					<p>Voidman:<br />Hrm .. nothing working here. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />First, i tried the very latest release. I got the following error:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/bin/sh ../../libtool  --mode=compile /home/phil/dev/wrt54g/buildroot/build_mipsel/staging_dir/bin/mipsel-linux-uclibc-gcc -I../../include -I../../include -I. -I../.. -I. -I./../.. -I./../../snmplib -I./.. -I..   -g -O2 -Delf  -c -o mibII/at.lo mibII/at.c

phil@aurora:~/dev/wrt54g/buildroot/net-snmp-5.1.2.pre2$</code></pre></div><p>With the release 5.1.1 i got the same error ..</p><p>Do I need the patch you posted to get it compiled?</p><p>bobsalt:<br />I&#039;ve got your script running now .. But there&#039;s a small problem. Everytime the updates.sh script is executed, i get a mail with the output of the script (the wget log). How can I disable this?<br />I already thought about using<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>wget http://myhostx/eth0 &gt; /tmp/eth0 &gt; /dev/null</code></pre></div><p> but then, the output isn&#039;t saved in /tmp/eth0. <br />Do you have an idea what to do?</p><p>And yet another problem. Compare your graph for the load average with my one. First yours, then mine:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://rrust.com/sysinfo/rrdtool-graphs/img/load_openwrt_day.png" alt="http://rrust.com/sysinfo/rrdtool-graphs/img/load_openwrt_day.png" /></span><br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://217.20.118.23/~phil/openwrt-stats/img/load_openwrt_day.png" alt="http://217.20.118.23/~phil/openwrt-stats/img/load_openwrt_day.png" /></span><br />As you may see, my graph has no numbers on the left hand side. How do i get them?</p>									</div>

I am running fedora core 1. Maybe suse is different for cron? - I&#039;m guessing you are using suse because you are in Germany :-)</p><p>*/01 * * * * root run-parts /etc/cron.1min &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</p><br /><p>on a side note, I didn&#039;t mod the processes script to the wrt.

What results you get when you do it on your server Phil? I think the processes would be an interesting graph to have in there, along with the uptime.</p><br /><br /><p>also, I have problems with spiking in my rrdtool db files. I tried running that killspike, but it just errors out...anyone know of a tool that will kill the spikes?</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, it gives me a result:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@ap:/# cat /proc/loadavg | awk &#039;{ print $1&quot;:&quot;$2&quot;:&quot;$3 }&#039;

When you look into it, it justs wgets the files and moves that what it has downloaded to /tmp/$VAR, but it still gives me the output.<br />I modified the updates.sh script a bit, now. I put a --quiet right after each wget command, and now it&#039;s not sending me mails anymore. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Btw, I&#039;m not using SuSE. I hate SuSE. I&#039;m using Debian.</p><p>And now this grep -c stuff. What do you want to do? Count the number of processes? I&#039;d better use this way:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@ap:/# ps -auwx | wc -l
     23
root@ap:/# </code></pre></div><p>And what are these spikes, you were talking about?</p>									</div>

					<p>maybe your wrt is just coasting then? I have mine up with an active tunnel. Try to set up some sort of repitive task to suck up some cpu cycles.
