					<p>Do you want to use the PPC to serve as a connection to the internet (like a 3G device)? Then it would act as a WAN port.<br />Or do you want the router to supply the internet connection to the PPC?<br />Your statement is not clear enough...<br />Connecting my old iPAQ H3800 series running linux via USB to my openwrt router works fine, see:<br /><a href="http://handhelds.org/moin/moin.cgi/UsbNet">http://handhelds.org/moin/moin.cgi/UsbNet</a></p><p>I don&#039;t know, if the USB port on a PPC running Windows Mobile will behave different...</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello &quot;atari&quot;,</p><p>I asked a similar question a month or two ago.&nbsp; I wrote:<br />&quot;My question is:&nbsp; If OpenWRT is loaded on a WL-500 (G or W) series Router, can it be configured to use the USB720 EVDO Modem, rather than the WAN port as the uplink to the Internet?&quot;</p><p>I got this answer from &quot;mbm&quot;:<br />&quot;Can be done (I&#039;ve tried it myself in the past). It just isn&#039;t covered in the documentation.</p><p>Here&#039;s what I remember of it -<br />The airprime module needs to be installed (and was subsequently packaged for openwrt use) and pppd and chat need to be installed. It can all be configured via the /etc/config/network config file, set the proto to ppp and use the device name (/dev/ttyUSB0 if I remember right) as the ifname. Chat scripts are used to handle the connect/disconnect which just perform AT commands.&quot;</p><br /><br /><br /><p>The router I&#039;ll be working with is the WL-500G, but the setup is for a friend with EVDO service that lives 2-1/2 hours away.&nbsp; So, I don&#039;t have the EVDO Modem here --- I&#039;ll have to try using the USB output from my cable modem into the router, to see if I can configure a USB port as the uplink to the Internet.&nbsp; If/When I get it working, I&#039;ll post the procedure that I used.</p><p>Take Care,<br />David Baldock</p><p>EDIT: The router I&#039;ve got is a WL-500G Premium.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dbaldock</strong> on 21 Aug 2007, 17:48)</p>
