					<p>Thanks to the openwrt team for their great job !</p><p>I&#039;ve tried 8.09 rc1 kernel 2.6.x on a wrt54glv1.1 yesterday. </p><p>Here are the results so far :<br />- Install &amp; Flash ok<br />- first boot ok<br />- ethernet ports ok<br />- WiFi connexion with hostap mini :<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;+ connection in 802.11g mode + wap psk ok : I was able to connect client PCs<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;x Unable to make the card work in 802.11b mode (is this normal ?) or in mixed mode which means that I could not connect to my 802.11b clients<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;x Bad performance : connection was very slow compared to whiterussian or to kamikaze 7.09 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;x Under heavy load (video streaming), the connection hangs for a few seconds before restarting again (most of the time it restarts).</p><p>Since I needed to connect 802.11b clients and needed radvd to work (radvd has been broken in the latest kamikaze 7.09 with kernel 2.4.x), I moved back to whiterussian for now but will be glad to give 8.09 another try later on if you want some new feedback.</p>									</div>

These behaviors correspond to the issues pointed out in one of the links on my <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=75994#p75994">previous post</a>. Unless someone fixes the uClibc-0.9.29, I am not sure if there is a way one can run asterisk on a Kamikaze distro. So far, I have to revert to uClibc-0.9.28.2 in order to run asterisk on my LaFonera FON2100 with openWRT SVN codes. I hope OpenWRT developers can spend some of their invaluable time to fix this issue related to asterisk before they decide release Kamikaze-8.09 distro.</p>									</div>

I posted the details to: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/4071">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/4071</a><br />I did a quick try on an installation and I can access the control interface using asterisk -r.

					<p>OK here we go. I am running on an AMD DBSC1100 development board, AMD Geode (x86 compatible, 266MHz.) It has scx200, 8139too, and some other jammies. I have a bcm43x card (haven&#039;t got THAT working yet...) Here&#039;s my other initial observations.</p><p>My cdrom was not detected, and there is no usb-storage driver included in the base install, nor usb support in the kernel. So I had no choice but to put a disk on my PC and load files on to it, and then attach this to my system. However, I want to run the system from a USB stick, which for most PCs and for this system is the most reasonable way to go for a firewall appliance. Unfortunately, there&#039;s no way to have a USB root without making an initrd. Scary!</p><p>Making a ppp connection is kind of confusing. You either need to understand how to specify a phone number to pppd, or how to use chat. Then you have to install chat, and write a chatscript, and use the #! token to make sh feed your chatscript to chat, because you can&#039;t specify options with quotes in the web config for ppp. So if you have say a serial modem on a usb interface you are going to need a super boat <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> load of packages just to make a ppp connection. I know us poor modem users are the third-worlders of the modern age, but the majority of the planet is still covered only by dialup.</p><p>All in all the new interface is about a trillion times better than trying to use the unfinished interface. I guess my most serious complaints are about ppp configuration, and the need for usb storage (and all that entails) in the kernel, or an initrd supporting same, for the x86 platform. More pppd options should be supported (without having to just use the custom options field.)</p><p>Oh yeah! What I REALLY want to know is, since the system is using grub and a 2.6 kernel, why not use root=UUID=... instead of /dev/hda2 on x86? Please.</p><p>All in all, of course, I&#039;m grateful! Keep up the good work.</p><p>Woops! found some more things to complain about <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> I also need b43legacy (which I know is unfinished - problems with AP/Master mode due to related software) and I believe that the opkg list should be retained through reboots by default. (It&#039;s easy enough to change, but again for modem users this is a problematic default.)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drinkypoo</strong> on 21 Nov 2008, 02:52)</p>

					<p>@DeusExMachina<br />Just use the usual bcm4xxx-2.6/wgt634u.bin for the WGT. It&#039;s running fine here.<br />About the .htaccess stuff. I think they&#039;re upgrading something here. wiki.openwrt.org is PW-protected also (and was not available this afternoon either, just answering with some message about upgrades going on)</p><p>Regards,<br />Patrick</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>EvilDevil</strong> on 21 Nov 2008, 18:27)</p>

					<p>Some more observations: looks like ppp &quot;usepeerdns&quot; option defaults 1 on get instead of 0, so even when it&#039;s turned off, it&#039;s turned on.I forget what file I made the change in <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Also, there is no kmod package for cdrom, so you cannot mount a CDROM.</p><p>Also, there is no ieee1394 module, so you cannot use firewire. I&#039;d like to use firewire storage devices. (USB2 sucks CPU! IEEE1394 doesn&#039;t. Very important on slow-CPU PC filesharing devices.)</p><p>Also, the samba3 package depended upon by the luci samba package does not have nmbd, only smbd. Could we get a nmbd package? Or nmbd added to samba3 package?</p><p>Finally, some issues with ext2: the root fs is often not properly unmounted. e2fsck is needed. I installed it, but I&#039;m not sure where to put it to have it run properly at boot. (I put it in /etc/preinit.arch) And the filesystem is mostly empty, so if the .image file were compressed instead of being served naked, it would be vastly smaller. mod_gzip won&#039;t do, because it doesn&#039;t permit resume.</p><p>Looks like the website (downloads and wiki) is back.</p>									</div>
