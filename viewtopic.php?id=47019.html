					<p>Hi,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; sorry if this is in the wrong place - I&#039;m new here.</p><p>Just wondering if anyone has looked at porting OpenWrt to sagem F@ST 2504n router, as supplied by sky broadband (in the uk). I&#039;ve acquired a couple via freecycle, but unfortunately they&#039;re not currently supported.&nbsp; 2404 and 2604 are supported, so maybe it&#039;s not too big a job.</p><p>I&#039;ll have a play around to see if I can extract some hardware specs.</p><p>thanks</p><p>Dave</p>									</div>
