					<p>Hello,</p><p>I recently bought a WRT1900AC and long story short i really can&#039;t stand the original firmware and I hoped on using OpenWRT that the box said should work. I understand this have some problem and i contacted Linksys support and of course all they said was: &quot;We&#039;re sorry&quot;. I can&#039;t return the router to the re seller so if i don&#039;t use it for a book stand i would like to use an alternative firmware that is stable.</p><p>Whats up with the OpenWRT firmware for this model?<br />Is there any other STABLE firmwares for the model i can use?</p><p>Thank you!</p>									</div>

					<p>There is no other alternative firmware at this time. Well intentioned idea, but poorly executed, resulting in unintentional false advertising (although they haven&#039;t updated the packaging to reflect that).</p>									</div>
