					<p>I searched for it and haven&#039;t found it.. Is it possible to make DNSmasq automatically have the hostnames from it&#039;s DHCP clients? So if I have 4 system getting their IP&#039;s from it, I can go to another system and ping it by it&#039;s host name and it will automagically resolve for me without me having to do any work?</p>									</div>

					<p>FYI: on a windows network, the auto-magical name resolution is facilitated by the windows networking services and the name resolution stacks.</p><p>For example, my home systems are all reachable through my non-WRT router via their respective names. With my linux file server, this ONLY works when the nmbd service is active..</p><p>Following mbm&#039;s suggestion, you could just add &quot;lan&quot; to the domain search order so that it checks &#039;compname.lan&#039; automatically during any name resolution. I believe a quick addition to the dnsmasq conf file will do the trick for your DHCP configured systems. This solution is more universal, because it doesn&#039;t rely on NetBIOS naming services.</p>									</div>
