					<p>Hi guys, I&#039;m new to OpenWRT/LEDE but I was able to install LAMP and WordPress on a GL.inet MT300A with a couple of days&#039; effort. I was surprised that no-one seems to have documented the process already, but I wrote up my notes as a brief how-to today and tried to upload it to this part of the forum. It got blocked because of all the URLs I included. Is there a process for me to submit it for verification/comments? I&#039;ve taken it about as far as I can working solo... Best, NP.</p>									</div>
