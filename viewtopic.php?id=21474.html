					<p>I have a wired network setup with a dedicated dhcp server and dns server. Using a Buffalo WHR-HP-G54 flashed to OpenWRT (White Russian), I want to hook the &quot;router&quot; up to the wired network and have it extend the network over wireless, but I want the router to not hand out ip addresses as I already have a DHCP Server setup. Thanks for any comments/suggestions/howtos</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>You might want to keep the DHCP server going - but have it only give addresses out to the wireless clients.&nbsp; Unfortunately you can&#039;t bridge wireless and wired devices together because it&#039;s not allowed for in the 802.11 standard.</p><p>Your best bet is to set the DHCP server up so it only sends addresses out to the wireless clients, and ensure IP forwarding is turned on.&nbsp; Then, in the server the DHCP server sets the route to, set up a static route for the wireless network to point to the router so that the wired clients can talk to the wireless clients and vice versa.</p><p>HTH</p>									</div>
