					<p>hello world. just put kamikaze on two brand new WL500GPs. Everything looks ok, except wlan.</p><p>At first both had wlan disabled. iwconfig showed txpower: off on both interfaces. I fiddled around with one of them and when i was about to write my problem here I had the idea of adding a config section with option mode ap (I only had wds up until then).<br />After a reboot this one router suddently brings up it&#039;s wl0 interface and adds it to the bridge. There is also an interface called wds0.1 which also seems to be what I want. I can&#039;t connect to the router using wlan: authentication timed out. So there still might be something wrong, but I only care for wds. Since wl0 came up after I added a normal ap wifi-iface I figure I have to put that on the other router as well.</p><p>/etc/config/wireless:<br />config wifi-device wl0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;option type broadcom<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;option channel 5</p><br /><p>config wifi-iface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;option device wl0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;option network lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;option mode ap<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;option ssid default<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;option encryption psk<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;option key myothersecretkey</p><p>config wifi-iface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;option device wl0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;option network lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;option mode wds<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;option ssid OpenWrt<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;option encryption psk<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;option key mysecretkey<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;option bssid MA:Co:Fo:TH:ER:dE:VI:CE</p><p>both images are the same, both config files are the same (except for the bssid) one of them brings up wl0, the other doesn&#039;t.<br />can anybody help me with this?</p><p>thanks in advance</p>									</div>

					<p>solved it, but don&#039;t know how or why. i reflashed the device and rebuild my configuration step by step. first simply enabling wlan, no extra settings. after a reboot wl0 came up. then i put in the ap-config, sreboot =&gt; works add the wds section, reboot =&gt; works.</p><p>Maybe the system doesn&#039;t like being told to unfolg it&#039;s full potential right after first boot :-)</p>									</div>
