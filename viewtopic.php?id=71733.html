					<p>Hello everyone, but I broke a router I have a couple of queries. I have a TP-LINK 841N that was manufactured for a specific ISP Telecentre (Argentina). Stop us there. Is not it just that tp-link only manufactures routers for special uses and no particular company ?. Two, however much it is made for that company, the router is mine and therefore I can do whatever I feel like. I wanted to flash it with dd wrt and I bricked it. Then I put stock firmware and openwrt but it never worked again. Is it not that in the 841N hardware all have to be identical? But I should carry another model. That changed in the hardware so that the other firmwares do not work ?. If anyone has the original Telecentre firmware for these routers I would appreciate it. Try to flash all possible firmware with a programmer for SPI memory but nothing went. Thank you for reading this post</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pindonga123</strong> on 8 Aug 2017, 02:13)</p>

					<p>Hey there.</p><p>As of this wiki page, the 841N is identical to the 841ND except for the detachable antennas:<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841n">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841n</a></p><p>As of this wiki page, there are 13 different revisions of the 841ND, all of them require different images:<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd</a></p><p>You might just have picked the wrong image and if you find the correct one, your router might start working again.</p><p>But since there&#039;s obviously lots of different versions of that low budget device, to me it&#039;s not entirely impossible there&#039;s another revision not being sold direct to customers but only to ISPs.<br />Usually special ISP models are internally identical and only have special casing (see e.g. german AVM fritz box for german ISP &quot;1&amp;1&quot;, they have grey and black boxes compared to the regular red ones AVM usually has) and some restrictions in terms of software. But chances are there&#039;s some ISP devices out there that differ not only in terms of color and software but in terms of chip layout as well.</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>golialive</strong> on 8 Aug 2017, 11:47)</p>

					<p>If it&#039;s simply a re-badged 841, you may find the version number on a sticker on the circuit board inside even though the ISP put their own label on the outside.</p><p>Does the bootloader still work?&nbsp; Have you tried a serial console?&nbsp; Almost all the Atheros based TP-Links have the same flash layout-- bootloader first 128K, ART last 64K, firmware in the middle.&nbsp; You can use a flash writer to drop an OpenWrt &quot;sysupgrade&quot; bin image directly into the chip at offset 128K.</p><p>A truly custom version might be like the Chinese market versions which have only 8M or 16M RAM instead of 32.&nbsp; In that case you are out of luck.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 8 Aug 2017, 16:24)</p>

					<p>It does not work in the end. Flashed this bin downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05.1/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-15.05.1-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr841n-v8-squashfs-factory.bin. My version is 8.0, after I tried with this TL-WR841ND-V8-stripped.zip and after with the original firmware downloaded from Tp-Link site and in the dd-wrt site. Nothing happened. The router show Power LED, The LED that is like a world with a ring in the top, LAN 1,2 and 3 LED all they turn on always and nothing happened. Sorry but my english is not good. I tried to set 30-30-30 hard reset but the reset buttom doesnt work. Please help me. I have a doubt the SPI programmer doesnt program the bootloader?. Only the firmware. There is the confusion</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pindonga123</strong> on 9 Aug 2017, 14:56)</p>

					<p>Do you get anything on the serial console?&nbsp; If you don&#039;t see the bootloader starting, you probably need to replace the bootloader.&nbsp; Get a factory firmware that includes the bootloader (has &#039;boot&#039; in the name) and remove I think the first 512 bytes, then flash starting at offset 0 in the chip.</p><p>An SPI programmer can write to all areas of the chip, so you have to be careful.&nbsp; In particular don&#039;t overwrite the ART partition at the last 64k.</p><p>Another approach would be to get another router of the same model and copy the bootloader and firmware out of its flash.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have a SPI programmer, IÂ´ve never used serial port, never understood how use it, tried to learn but I couldnt. So I decided buy a SPI programmer, so I downloaded the firm and flashed with it. So Did I broke my router?</p>									</div>

					<p>You have probably overwritten the bootloader by placing the firmware in the wrong place in the flash chip.</p><p>First thing you should do is read the whole chip and store that as a backup, hopefully the ART is still OK.&nbsp; The ART data is unit-specific written at the factory with things like the MAC address and radio calibration.</p>									</div>
