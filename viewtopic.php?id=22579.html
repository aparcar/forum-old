					<p>Same problem over here with r18485. To my understanding there are some troubles with modules. The kmod-zd1211rw depends on:</p><p>kmod-usb-core<br />kmod-crypto-aes<br />kmod-crypto-arc4</p><p>All the above seam to be missing from the <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ixp4xx/packages/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … /packages/</a></p><p>As a workaround I tried adding <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09.1/ixp4xx/packages/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8 … /packages/</a><br />where those packages seams to be present, but when I try an opkg install kmod-zd1211rw it fails with an error:</p><p>* Packages were found, but none compatible with the architectures configured</p><p>you can force opkg to install zd1211rw (-force-depend) but still the missing modules will not make it working. To my surprise I have an older installation of openwrt from trunk (maybe an year or so) where all seams to work just fine...</p><p>Any help from the developers will be much appreciated ... </p><p>regards Fulvio.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fulvy70</strong> on 26 Nov 2009, 06:22)</p>

					<p>Hi Rune!<br />I&#039;ve worked a bit on my NSLU2. I downloaded from svn a trunk distribution for openwrt and complied it myself... took a while but was OK, I was expecting something more &quot;painful&quot;. Installed on the NSLU2 no problems, I can now load my version of the modules that were some how not properly complied in the trunk distribution provided by Openwrt themselves. </p><p>Every needed module/tool seams to load fine, dependencies seams to be fulfilled and WPA works too ... finally ...</p><p>As far as I&#039;ve understood Openwrt in all cases uses wpa_supplicant to authenticate. The network start-up scripts will parse the /etc/config/wireless and will create a temporary wpa_supplicant.conf file and wpa_supplicant will be started with that temp file.</p><p>The second NSLU2 unit I have (one year old or so) with Openwrt and a zd1211rw wireless key does exactly the same things (all the configuration is in the /etc/conf/wireless) and it uses wpa_supplicant.</p><p>What&#039;s I&#039;ve noticed in my case is that I have to be sure all modules are really coming form &quot;my own&quot; complied openwrt distribution (opkg.conf must point only at my package source). A mix of stuff compiled by me and something from the official openwrt &quot;breaks the box&quot; </p><p>I tried a &quot;wifi detect&quot; and I noticed an error:</p><p>Error for wireless request &quot;Set Power Management&quot; (8B2C) :<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; SET failed on device wlan0 ; Operation not supported.</p><p>Probably It&#039;s something not to really worry about ... who knows ...</p><br /><p>Cheers Fulvio.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fulvy70</strong> on 28 Nov 2009, 00:28)</p>

					<p>Fulvio,</p><p>I&#039;m glad it works for you.</p><p>Could you please check If you see the real mac address when issuing `cat /sys/class/ieee80211/phy1/macaddress`</p><p>When I issue this command I get a really strange reply (&quot;c12b80c0&quot;). This value seems to break the tests in /lib/wifi/wireless.sh, which prevents the /etc/config/wireless coonfiguration to work.</p><p>Rune</p>									</div>
