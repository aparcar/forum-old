					<p>Thank you wayne1958. I will get Linksys WRT1900ACS. It is sadly many AC routers WiFi are not supported or not stable. I have tried Asus RT-AC68U and Netgear R7800. Both are bad WiFi because of non support drivers. We have Linksys WRT1900AC running CC and it is really stable.</p>									</div>

					<p>The R7800 seems to run fine with <a href="https://forum.lede-project.org/t/netgear-r7800-exploration-ipq8065-qca9984/285/5">LEDE</a>.</p><p>The mwlwifi stuff certainly doesn&#039;t seem to be any more stable than ath10k. So between those, pick ath10k.</p>									</div>
