					<p>Surely Thombo could&#039;ve found answer with some googling, but I still think it&#039;s not fair to bash him for asking here. Assuming need was for solution that works on stock OpenWrt installation most examples on net fail - just like those posted on this thread. Microperl version is fine, but it&#039;s not part of OpenWrt unless you install extra packages that eat precious flash space. However awk is part of OpenWrt and syntax is quite portable across various platforms, not just different OpenWrt versions.</p>									</div>
