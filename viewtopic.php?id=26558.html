					<p>I&#039;ve been searching around for a solution to this for a while and haven&#039;t found anything... which always makes me nervous that it&#039;s so obvious nobody else ever needed to ask... anyway...</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Context: Modifying the backfire ar23xx Madwifi driver on an ap51 board, frequently compiling new changes and testing them. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;What I&#039;m looking for: A way to speed up the process. <br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;1) Is there a way to just compile the kernel (or even just compile the madwifi driver and install it in the kernel) rather than having to go through the whole make world process? </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;2) And after that, is there a way to just load the new kernel to the board, rather than having to flash the whole thing? Currently I&#039;m writing both the lzma and rootfs file to the board (via redboot) and it&#039;s time consuming, even with multiple boards...</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;After perusing the forums/documentation I was under the impression that the lzma file had all of the kernel in it, but my changes don&#039;t propagate until I also re-flash the rootfs so I&#039;m clearly missing something... I would greatly appreciate it if anyone could enlighten me or give any pointers on how to more efficiently carry out the steps mentioned above. :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>1) Yes. Try &quot;make package/madwifi/install&quot;.&nbsp; This will compile a new package (.ipk) and install it to the image.</p><p>2) Yes. You can simply install the new package created by the compile (in the bin/&lt;platform&gt;/packages directory) to the router with &quot;opkg install &lt;package_name&gt;.ipk&quot;.&nbsp; You will have to get the .ipk to the router first.&nbsp; You can copy it to the /tmp folder (either via wget from a ftp server or with a USB drive) and then install it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>LinkZ</strong> on 14 Sep 2010, 20:29)</p>
