					<p>I also am the happy owner of a bricked WRT54GS and tried several things to get it up and running again. Until now no succes. Se below a brief history on the issue:</p><p>The problem started after I flashed the box with nico&#039;s openwrt. It worked fine until I started playing with the NVRAM variabeles. After a few changes I tried to commit the new values to NVRAM but the box didn&#039;t let me do this. It generated an error after the &#039;nvram commit&#039; command (Don&#039;t know the exact message but is was something about not able to write to NVRAM). So I tried to power cycle the device to get it working again. Since then the power LED started flashing constantly and the box did not work anymore. </p><p>I tried to solve this problem by soldering a Com port on the device to check what was really happening and to try to break into the CFE with CRTL+C. This didn&#039;t work either. Also tried to do the trick with pin 15+16 and pin 5+6 and several TFTP downloads. None of this solved the problem. So I am afraid that the box really died on me.

					<p>hi!</p><p>One of the possible debricking solution is using serial console and send CRTL-C sequence to CFE boot. Plug the power and hold down CTRL and C. If this not helps, repeat. If you get lucky, you see CFE&gt; command prompt. After that, nvram set_boot=wait and nvram commit.</p>									</div>

					<div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>thanks the pin 5 and 6 works for me too.<br />I send a new firmware to the WRT with TFTP now the unit reboot and the power is not blinking anymore but I can&#039;t access it or ping it on 192.168.1.1<br />Any idea ?</p></blockquote></div><p>I have been struggeling with a related problem for most of the weekend. My findings are these:<br />At one point I was able to load the LinkSys firmware with TFTP, and then load a SveaSoft firmware with the web-interface. No matter which OpenWRT firmware I tried to load, the box wouldn&#039;t come up after rebooting.</p><p>Now, I&#039;ve come to the conclusion that what was happening was the OpenWRT starting up, detecting a JFFS-filesystem, trying to boot from it, but then failing because the FS is broken. Aparently the JFFS-filesystem is not entirely wiped when installing the LinkSys or SveaSoft firmwares.</p><p>To solve this you need to boot OpenWRT in failsafe mode. On the GS timing is crucial, since you need to hold the reset-button at the correct time, but if you hold it for too long, the nvram wil reset and turn off boot_wait (if this happens you will probably need to do the debricking trick by shorting pin5 &amp; 6 on the flash during bootup - at least that&#039;s what I had to do).</p><p>What I did was to flood-ping the box during boot:<br />[root@spiffship]# ping -f 192.168.1.1<br />This prints a &quot;.&quot; each time a packet is lost. When the tftp-server is up, the router also replies to our ping-requests, so it will stop printing dots for 2 sec (assuming boot_wait is set). When it starts printing dots again, wait 1 sec then hold reset for 3 sec, and you should be getting into failsafe mode. At least this worked for me, but remember not to hold the reset-button for too long.</p><p>BTW: This flood-pinging also makes sure your APT-table is updated, so one might have better success with TFTP&#039;ing after first flood-pinging and rebooting the router, then rebooting the router again and doing the TFTP.</p><p>I read somewhere that setting boot_wait to off still gives you a small time window to hit the TFTP-server, but in this case only like 0.5 sec. Can anyone confirm this?</p><p>/Spiff</p>									</div>

					<p>i have a dead? wrt54gs here too, tried all that stuff with the pins, reset button aso.. nothing worked, power-led still flashing. sometimes power led and dmz led lights green, but i get no lan connection. i noticed that the broadcom chip gets very(!) hot after a few seconds, my second wrt just gets warm.</p><p>any ideas?</p>									</div>

					<p>about this corrupted jffs2 assertion, is there anything like a signature or what which can indicates that it is valid or not ? If that is the case, why not just create a firmware that is significantly larger than the previous one so it would overwrite the jffs2 signature and make openwrt starts all over again from fresh ?</p>									</div>

This will reformat the jffs2 file system and keep your firmware as small as necessary.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m looking for a firewall script similar to the one in the org. WRT54 firmware.</p><p>I used to write my own ipfilter rules, but that was a long <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> time ago and there is a reason why i know like SuSEfirewall2...</p><p>I like to do runtime changes to the firewall and shorewall is not the answer - like other iptables rules generator it includes many stuff not needed on the WRT54. </p><p>The advantage (or weakness) of the org. firewall(.c) in the firmware is, that it does create the iptables rules direct from strict predefined (nvram) values, which is of course much faster than a nice readable config file.</p><p>Has anyone written a fast iptables script? <br />May be it would make it also easier for the web front end to read the firewall config, if the rules are created from similar base values as the org. firewall.</p><p>A (possible) fast generator with a readable config file s is:<br /><a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/agt/">http://freshmeat.net/projects/agt/</a> <br />It is written i C and runs also on openwrt. But i had to fix the iptables flush code (for openwrt), and i am not so sure about the quality of the code/ipfilter rules.</p>									</div>
