					<p>Hello,</p><p>I just began working with Opwrt, and I&#039;m totally impressed, it turns a totally dated device into a fully working firewall/L3 switch.</p><p>Got an old huawey router working and a relative game me a livebox 2.1 labled as Arcadyan ARV7519RW22-A-LT. Also compatible as its page indicates.</p><p>openwrt.org/toh/arcadyan/arv7519</p><p>I&#039;m following that manual and got the serial port working and all.</p><p>I can see the output &quot;Enter command mode â€¦&quot; But hitting space does nothing. I resoldered the port a few times and can&#039;t see any change.</p><p>It may be that with linux and minicom another key is used? Am I missing some step? Because there are things in the manual I don&#039;t understand and I blame my lack of experience in this.</p><p>Any help is welcome.</p>									</div>
