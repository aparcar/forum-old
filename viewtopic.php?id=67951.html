					<p>Greetings!<br />I searched the forum for topics about the WR710N V2.1 and from what i understand, the trunk is compatible with it. It can be installed from the original firmware.<br />My question is: can OpenWRT for the V1.x models be installed over OpenWRT trunk for V2.1 models?<br />I&#039;m asking this because i would like to try Gargoyle on this hardware. Apparently someone flashed without problems a WR710N V1 with a build of Gargoyle for the 720N.<br />Please help me with your ideas and suggestions.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello again.<br />A user on Gargoyle forums was kind enough to point me to dl.eko.one.pl where i found a build of Gargoyle for the WR710N v2.1 that can be installed directly from factory.<br />So, i think this can be marked as solved.<br />BTW: if someone has this router model and needs a webrevert to factory there is a file built by a user on the DD-WRT forum. It works well, since it was the one i used to do just that.<br />Thank you all for your interest.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, indeed. Let me thank you in this forum as well.<br />I did forgot to tell that the webrevert was for DD-WRT only. Good on you for pointing that out.<br />Speaking of which, i don&#039;t really know how to webrevert from Gargoyle. Friendzombie&#039;s stripped TP-Link firmwares don&#039;t have anything for the V2.1, same as the other one.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cmay</strong> on 8 Oct 2016, 20:42)</p>

					<p>well if you left Stock firmware, was because you dont like it<br />if you really need to go back to Stock this is the method<br /><a href="http://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=4816">http://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/vi â€¦ amp;t=4816</a><br />if ypu dont know what you are doing, you will end up with a brick</p>									</div>

					<p>I see...<br />Well, it would look like a pretty nice brick, but i think i&#039;ll pass.<br />Maybe it&#039;s possible to flash DD-WRT directly either form Gargoyle or from OpenWRT? Then, the webrevert would work.</p>									</div>
