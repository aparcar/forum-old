					<p>This is a follow up to another topic on my Windows VM. The VM is running in a Mac using Parallels Desktop virtualization software.</p><p>I can NOT get either of my 2 Macs to ping the VM by host name, though pinging by ip address now works.</p><p>There is a work around that fixes the issue on each Mac. Add the following line to /etc/hosts:</p><p>192.168.1.223&nbsp; &nbsp; win8x64propd.local</p><p>But I prefer to use DNS in the OpenWrt router to handle this. The same line above is also entered in /etc/hosts on the router. The line should NOT be needed in /etc/hosts on the 2 Macs. For some reason the DNS lookup through the router is failing.</p><p>Any ideas?</p><p>Steve</p>									</div>

					<p>It seems I fixed my own problem. I did a full reset with LuCI, under Flash Operations &gt; Reset to Defaults. And now my LAN universe is happy. And I only had to change a handful of defaults after the reset. Apparently some settings previously that I played with were messing things up.</p><p>Steve</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>smalltalk</strong> on 8 Jan 2014, 23:19)</p>
