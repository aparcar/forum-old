					<p>Hello,</p><p>In first I would like to excuse me for my bad english, I speak french :-)</p><p>I flashed yesterday my wrt150N (v1.1) with the openwrt Kamikaze 7.09. After one day of configuration this is working with the wireless too <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> But I can only use Wireless 802.11g and not 802.11n.</p><p>I have search about that but find nothing, just a post (on the 2007-02) saying that kamikaze will support 802.11n on wrt150n soon.</p><p>Actually I use the package &quot;kmod-brcm-wl-mimo&quot; to activate the wireless. Must I install another package that will unlock the 802.11n on this router ?</p><p>Thanks in advance if anybody has an idea.</p><p>Have a good day ^^</p>									</div>

You should consult the Madwifi page and research what wifi chipset this router uses to find it&#039;s compatibility. But perhaps I am behind on&nbsp; Madwifi developments....</p>									</div>
