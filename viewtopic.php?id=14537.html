					<p>Have a strange issue with an actual svn checkout. Anyone gamble on 888.com?<br />I can join a table, but get timeouts and reconnects just to die in some seconds.<br />Login is no problem, just joning tables times out. All surfin is ok by time, but the gambling does not.<br />Anyone who can verify this? i can dl, surf etc. in the meantime, the sync is ok.</p><p>Actual kernel: KAMIKAZE (bleeding edge, r10465) svn today build.</p><p>cat /proc/version<br />Linux version 2.6.24.2 (wo@home) (gcc version 4.1.2) #1 Fri Feb 15 13:36:57 CET 2008</p><br /><p>Edit: At least r10465 does _not_ work for me on 888.com and youtube.com. I got strange timeouts, it just hangs, but it is not the connection. Surfin is all fine. Youtube just hangs at about 50% loading videos. Reflashed KAMIKAZE (bleeding edge, r10339) and its all nice. 888.com and youtube.com working.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ahu</strong> on 16 Feb 2008, 00:23)</p>
