					<p>I&#039;m trying to get <a href="http://blog.crash-override.net/index.php/206">this</a> working on Kamikaze 8.09<br />Because I wasn&#039;t able to find any PermitTunnel (or similiar) option in dropbear I just simply skipped that part. When I connect to dropbear using sudo ssh -w any:any 192.168.1.1 I get a connection, but neither my server nor my client get a tunX device. tun is loaded for both server and client. Am I doing something wrong, is there a PermitTunnel option for dropbear, that I missed or is dropbear not capable of what I&#039;m trying to do?</p><p>PS: I&#039;ve just stumpled upon this:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Second: You need OpenSSH at least version 4.3. I&#039;ll use version 4.3p2 for this HowTo.</p></blockquote></div><p>This might be the problem :-/</p><p>PPS:<br />When trying to install openssh-sever I get:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>* Only have 1024 available blocks on filesystem /, pkg libopenssl needs 1257</p></blockquote></div><p>I&#039;ll need to build a custom image to get openssh fit onto my WRT54G, or? Is there somewhere a list of optional packages that I can freely drop from my image? I need WPA2 WLAN and I&#039;m connected through DSL so I need pppoe (that&#039;s what I&#039;ve seen suggested in another thread). I&#039;d rather also keep luci, because sometimes it simply makes my life easier (I&#039;m no Linux guru), but might also drop it if there&#039;s no other good option - and learn how to administer OpenWRT through shell <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>PPPS:<br />Ok, I decided I&#039;m going to build Kamikaze 8.09 myself. I&#039;m not sure however which packages I need and which not. I used the BRCM profile + target from within make menuconfig and compared the selected packages with those currently installed an my router (opkg list_installed). I found most packeges where selected. However, some wheren&#039;t and some which where selected aren&#039;t currently installed on my router. </p><p>Packages which are currently installed but not selected:<br />hostapd-mini<br />hotplug2<br />kmod-crypto-core<br />kmod-crypto-aes<br />kmod-crypto-arc4<br />kmod-b43 (did not even find it in the configuration menu)<br />ppp-mod-pppoe (did not find it in configuration menu)<br />udevtrigger (did not find it in configuration menu)<br />mac80211 (did not find it in configuration menu)<br />luci-* (not in menu either, but never mind that stuff)<br />lua + liblua (I suppose luci depends on them)</p><p>Packets selected in the configuration menu, but not currently installed on my router:</p><p>Some BRCM packets from the propieratary kernel module drivers (can&#039;t recall exact names currently)</p><p>Additionally I want kmod-tun and openssh server installed. If I install openssh server I don&#039;t have to install dropbear, right?<br />Why are the packets up there not selected by default? Some of the seem rather important (for a wifi router) eg hotplug2 or hostapd-mini.<br />And do I really need those kernel module drivers that are currently not installed on my router?</p><p>When I have built my image I suppose the best way to flash it is using mtd, right? One thing I currently cannot figure out though is how I will get my image from my laptop to my router? I could certainly wget it, but I&#039;d need a webserver for that. Is there another way I&#039;m currently missing?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dev0</strong> on 1 Nov 2009, 06:00)</p>

					<p>Ok, a reply this time, to keep some structure. Just for the records: I&#039;m doing this on a WRT54GL 1.1</p><p>I built Kamikaze 8.09 using Broadcom BCM947xx/953xx [2.6] as target and Broadcom BCM43xx Wifi as profile. I decided to not include luci to free up space. I figured out, that choosing the 2.6 target would &quot;fix&quot; alot of my missing packages that used to be installed on my router. I added kmod-tun and openssh-server + openssh-client. I then removed dropbear because I wouldn&#039;t need it anymore with openssh installed. I&#039;ve also chosen hostapd and hostapd-utils instead of hostapd-mini, because I might need WEP sometimes. I don&#039;t really know if I&#039;ll need hostapd-utils, but since I have plenty of space left without luci I added it.<br />When it comes to the wireless drivers though I&#039;m not sure what to install. I ran ./scripts/feeds install kmod-b43; ./scripts/feeds install b43 to get that b43 module that was loaded in my old install and it did get something. I wasn&#039;t able to pinpoint it though in the menu configuration. I supposed it&#039;s the kmod-net-bcm43xx package, but I wasn&#039;t sure. So I simply installed kmod-mac80211 and kmod-net-bcm43xx. If I&#039;m not wrong that are all the modifcations I&#039;ve done to the image. I compiled it and flashed it to my router (I figured out I can use scp to copy the image to the router). Everything seems to work fine <strong>except</strong> wifi. Stupid as I am, I forgot to save my wireless configurations. However, I tried to manually configuring the wifi adapter using the <a href="http://kamikaze.openwrt.org/docs/openwrt.html#x1-120001.2.2">documentation</a>. I wasn&#039;t sure which driver to choose (mac80211 or broadcom) so I tried both. When I use the broadcom driver it gives me an device not supported error message when reloading the configuration files. When I use the mac80211 driver this message does not appear, but instead it seems like if the configuration of the device (which I called wifi0) will fail, because the device is not present (alot of errors stating this, after reloading the network configuration). If I check with ifconfig -a there&#039;s no wifi0 device. I suppose the mac80211 driver is the right one, but I don&#039;t know why the wifi0 device is not created. Here is my wireless configuration I used to test my wifi:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-device wifi0
        option type mac80211
        option channel 5

config wifi-iface
        option device wifi0
        option mode ap
        option network lan
        option ssid &#039;OpenWrt&#039;
        option hidden 0
        option encryption none</code></pre></div><p>One thing that got me thinking though is that lsmod | grep b43 gives me nothing and even opkg update &amp;&amp; opkg list | grep b43 gives me nothing. Where is that kmod-b43 package gone and do I need it?!<br />Another thing that might be interesting is that after flashing my /etc/config/wireless file was completely empty, although the documentation states, that their should be a dummy configuration if the router successfully identified my wifi chip - which I suppose it didn&#039;t.</p><p>I really don&#039;t know any further at this point. I&#039;d really appreciate some hints what I&#039;m doing wrong and how to get my wifi back up running. Thanks for your effort upfront!</p><p>PS: I tried switching the interface name to wlan0 and adding the option disabled 0. Both didn&#039;t help.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dev0</strong> on 1 Nov 2009, 17:56)</p>
