					<p>Hi all. I&#039;m trying to set up a VPN between two locations, with routing (not bridging) between the two networks (so I&#039;m using openvpn on tun0, not tap0). Then I&#039;d like to get mDNS forwarding across the VPN. This gives me a happy medium between routed and bridged subnets.</p><p>I had this working before under kamikaze, and liked the resulting behavior. I&#039;ve upgraded everything to backfire, and am trying to get back to the same point.</p><p>At this point I&#039;ve installed and configured openvpn, installed avahi-daemon, but I&#039;m not seeing any mDNS traffic across the VPN link.</p><p>I know that I need to add &quot;allow-point-to-point=yes&quot; to the [server] section of /etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf; I&#039;ve done that. And I&#039;ve enabled avahi&#039;s reflector with &quot;enable-reflector=yes&quot;.</p><p>If I start avahi-daemon from the command line as &quot;avahi-daemon --debug&quot; so I can see its debug output on the console, I see it start up and &quot;joining mDNS multicast group&quot; for the br-lan, eth1 and tun0 interfaces, as I&#039;d expect.&nbsp; (Without allow-point-to-point, it ignores tun0.)</p><p>However, if at this point I watch mDNS traffic on the VPN link with &quot;tcpdump -i tun0 udp port 5353&quot;, and do mDNS lookups from another machine on my LAN, tcpdump sees no traffic.</p><p>Sanity checks:</p><p>If I do &quot;tcpdump -i br-lan udp port 5353&quot; on the router and do mDNS lookups from another machine, tcpdump sees the requests (on the lan, regardless of whether avahi-daemon is running or how it&#039;s configured).</p><p>If I do &quot;tcpdump -i eth1 udp port 5353&quot; on the router and do mDNS lookups from another machine, tcpdump sees the requests (only if avahi-daemon is running and the reflector is enabled and I haven&#039;t denied it from using eth1); this proves that avahi&#039;s reflector is active, and both necessary and sufficient for 5353 traffic on eth1.</p><p>However, nothing I&#039;ve tried has resulted in any udp port 5353 traffic whatsoever on the vpn link.</p><p>I have a hunch, possibly wildly incorrect, that avahi doesn&#039;t like something about the tun0 interface, which ifconfig shows as</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@wormhole:/etc/avahi# ifconfig tun0
tun0      Link encap:UNSPEC  HWaddr 00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00</code></pre></div><p>I don&#039;t remember the link having empty encap and hwaddr under kamikaze, though I could be misremembering.</p><p>Anyway. Anyone have this working, know what&#039;s wrong or what to change? Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>Any ideas on this? I&#039;m still having the same problem, and can confirm the results above still hold (I can get avahi to forward mDNS from br-lan to eth1, but not from br-lan to tun0).</p><p>Of course I don&#039;t actually want it forwarding mDNS onto eth1, which is the WAN link to my ISP, so normally I run avahi configured with deny-interfaces=eth1.</p><p>Anyone using avahi to forward mDNS across a routed openvpn link, and/or know how I could get this to work?</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, &quot;tun0&quot; sounds like its a routed tunnel and not a bridged one. mDNS is designed to operate with broadcasts which aren&#039;t propagated across P-t-P links. Establish a bridged (tap) OpenVPN tunnel instead and mDNS/Avahi should work.</p>									</div>

					<p>I really don&#039;t want to bridge the networks, though -- the VPN is across a WAN link with limited throughput and higher latency compared to my LAN. I don&#039;t mind traffic intentionally crossing that link, but I don&#039;t want everything bridged.</p><p>That&#039;s where avahi comes in -- it&#039;s got mDNS reflector functionality to repeat mDNS across networks where broadcast doesn&#039;t reach. (If I was using OpenVPN in bridged/tap configuration, I wouldn&#039;t need avahi; mDNS would just work with its default broadcast nature.)</p><p>So with avahi running, and its reflector enabled (which it isn&#039;t by default), and told to use P-t-P networks (again, not the default but available as an option), I should be able to propagate mDNS across the routed tunnel.</p><p>I had this working fine with whiterussian a few years ago, but have been unable to get it working in backfire.</p>									</div>

					<p>I tried strace on avahi-daemon and eventually just compiled it from source and started modifying the source to see what it&#039;s really doing.</p><p>The reflector does a bunch of sendmsg(), one per active interface, and the sendmsg() on eth0 and eth1 succeeds but the one for tun0 always returns EINVAL.</p><p>Turns out that&#039;s because it&#039;s using 192.168.255.2 as the source address (192.168.255.0/24 is the subnet associated with tun0, but the IP address of the router on that subnet is 192.168.255.1, not 192.168.255.2).</p><p>I didn&#039;t know that was the problem, but it turns out the clue is in the log messages from avahi-daemon at startup:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Joining mDNS multicast group on interface tun0.IPv4 with address 192.168.255.2.
New relevant interface tun0.IPv4 for mDNS.</code></pre></div><p>So the problem is that avahi is picking the wrong address -- I&#039;ll take this up with the avahi project directly to see if this is configurable, a bug, etc.</p><p>Also, avahi-daemon --debug should print more debugging information to daemon_log(LOG_DEBUG), but that doesn&#039;t seem to go anywhere -- I had to hack up the source to see the messages printed that way.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I found what looks like an avahi bug and an easy fix -- <a href="http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/avahi/2011-January/001970.html">http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/a … 01970.html</a>. Though it&#039;s a little hard to be sure since the offending code dates to the beginning of the avahi project, and it&#039;s hard to believe it&#039;s always been wrong.</p><p>The avahi bug tracker is down and nobody but me has posted to their mailing list in almost 3 weeks, so I&#039;m not having much luck getting anyone over there to confirm the bug or accept/reject the patch.</p>									</div>
