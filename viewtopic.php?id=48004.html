					<p>1. Is your router&#039;s LAN IP 192.168.1.1 ?<br />2. Is squid working without problem? Try to change your browser&#039;s proxy settings to 192.168.1.1:3128 .<br />3. It seems squid needs configuraton parameter for tranparent proxy. <br /><a href="http://www.broexperts.com/2013/03/squid-as-transparent-proxy-on-centos-6-4/">http://www.broexperts.com/2013/03/squid â€¦ entos-6-4/</a></p><p>Good luck!</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your quick response, I would like to mention that yes my router lan ip is 192.168.1.1( Router IP also as gateway ip) and I installed squid inside the router so there is no external squid proxy and as I installed inside the router which is ubiquiti routerstation pro and now I would like to direct all 80 port traffic via that squid proxy which is installed in my router. I will appreciate your response. I tried to test just squid first and i am using 2.7 version and I am getting an error because I am thinking this is squid issue or may not be the firewall issue. Please have look on that error below.
