					<p>(I am no native English speaker, so please excuse wrong grammar and typos)</p><p>Hi!</p><p>I am not able to reach my Linksys WRT54GL v1.1 router after flashing it to OpenWRT Kamikaze 7.09. Here are the steps I made, I hope this can give you an idea of what I did wrong:</p><p>*) Installed openwrt-wrt54g-2.4-squashfs.bin via web interface on a new WRT54GL<br />*) After reboot, I could successfully connect to the router (192.168.1.1). I used telnet and then changed the root password.<br />*) Connected with ssh, this was successful.<br />*) I edited /etc/network/config for pppoe connection. If I remember correctly, I changed the interface wan lines to<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>   config interface     wan
        option ifname   &quot;eth0.1&quot;
    #option proto   dhcp
        option proto    pppoe
        option username &quot;myusername&quot;
        option password &quot;mypassword&quot;</code></pre></div><p>*) After ifup wan, I could ping <a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a> e.g. with ssh. However, I could not connect to the Internet from my computer.<br />*) I added &quot;src X-Wrt <a href="http://downloads.x-wrt.org/xwrt/kamikaze/7.09/brcm-2.4/packages/\">http://downloads.x-wrt.org/xwrt/kamikaze/7.09/brcm-2.4/packages/&quot;</a> to /etc/ipkg.conf and then installed WebIf with ipkg.<br />*) [Note: This seems the step where I got f*cked up] I went to the network tab of Webif and changed the LAN setting to Bridge IIRC. I don&#039;t remember what exactly I chose and the screenshots I found on x-wrt.org are a little bit different to the Webif version I used, but it was something like that.<br />[/list]</p><p>Now I cannot ping the router and I can&#039;t connect to it using ssh. Do you have any idea of how to make the router alive again, or have I just successfully created a brick? I&#039;d appreciate your answers very much. Since I now have two days off and wanted to invest them in restructuring my network, fast answers would be great (though I am well aware that this is a voluntary and no professional support forum).</p><p>TIA &amp;&amp; Kind Regards</p>									</div>

					<p>you can try to get in failsafe-mode and then connect with telnet to 192.168.1.1 (you have to press the reset-button in the right moment, read the docs about failsafemode!!!)<br />in failsafe mode no dhcp-server is running, so you have to set the ip on your pc manually.&nbsp; <br />if you can connect to your router you can try to fix your network config, or you can erase the jffs2-partition to erase all your config-changes and start again.</p>									</div>
