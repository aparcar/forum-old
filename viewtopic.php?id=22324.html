Say there are one or more clients associated with the AP. if the clients or the AP do not communicate to each other (not 80211 radio comm) there will not be any entries in the ARP table.</p>									</div>

Here is the issue with this tool. Say, a client is associated with the access point and link is fine for some time. If the client is disconnected without sending 80211 deassoc message (due to interference or fading or watever the reason being), this entry is invalid and it will exists for some time.</p>									</div>
