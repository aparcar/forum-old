					<p>Hello, </p><p>Currently I am running Barrier Breaker r41181 on a TP-Link 1043 V2.1. Whenever trying to install OpenVPN OpenSSL (2.3.2-3) via either Luci or command line I get the following message: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Collected errors:
 * satisfy_dependencies_for: Cannot satisfy the following dependencies for openvpn-openssl:
 *     kernel (= 3.10.36-1-dd0494e7c599544e99d1297b2b20740c) * 
 * opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package openvpn-openssl.</code></pre></div><p>It is a fresh install, in which I mean that I bought the router a few days ago and flashed it with OpenWRT yesterday. <br />Is there something I am completely missing or did not think of? <br />Or is it a known problem with the current release? </p><p>Thanks a million in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>When opkg complains about kernel dependencies not being satisfied it is because in the meantime, a new snapshot has been built with a new kernel signature.
