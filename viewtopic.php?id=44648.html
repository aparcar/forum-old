					<p>Hi all!</p><p>I am new to openwrt. Today I flashed (for the first time ever) my TP-Link WA7510N with the squashfs-factory firmware. It all worked fine until I messed up the bridging in luci ... now I am unable to connect to the WA7510N.</p><p>After some search I figured out that &quot;failsafe&quot; is the way to go, as described at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe</a> .</p><p>My WA7510N is connected to this machine:<br />eth0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Link encap:Ethernet&nbsp; HWaddr b8:27:eb:80:34:31&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inet addr:192.168.1.202&nbsp; Bcast:192.168.1.255&nbsp; Mask:255.255.255.0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST&nbsp; MTU:1500&nbsp; Metric:1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RX packets:0 errors:2 dropped:1 overruns:0 frame:1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TX packets:54 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)&nbsp; TX bytes:2700 (2.6 KiB)</p><br /><p>Problems are:<br />a) &quot;tcpdump -Ani eth0 port 4919 and udp&quot; returns nothing than silence.<br />b) I am unable to connect via &quot;telnet 192.168.1.1&quot;<br />c) Pressing the reset button does not seem to change anything (eg. pressing the reset button before and during power on (for many seconds) does not result in any output, neither does pressing the button shortly after power on. No telnet, nothing. The LAN LED is behaving all times the same...)</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><p>If anyone could give me a hint it would be highly appreciated.</p><p>Best regards,</p><p>Martin</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mb2013</strong> on 10 Jun 2013, 18:52)</p>

					<p>I&#039;ve the same problem...</p><p>I flashed my device the last days several times with a custom build image. It worked perfectly until yesterday.</p><p>The same procedure as the otherdays i modifed at first /etc/config/network to my IP Range. But after a reboot of this last flash i didn&#039;t came per telnet on the TL-WA7510n.<br />I didn&#039;t came in the Failsafe Mode like you, too.</p><p>But the difference is i became 5-10 seconds after the power plugin for few seconds (2-3sec.) a ping on 192.168.1.1 . After that the device doesn&#039;t answer anymore.</p><p>Does anyone have an idea?!</p>									</div>

					<p>I later checked the source and no button definition for WA7510N was found. I guess that&#039;s why pressing the button cannot trigger the failsafe.</p>									</div>
