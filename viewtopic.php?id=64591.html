					<p>Here&#039;s a strange one.&nbsp; DGN3500 running trunk 49276 but this is an issue that&#039;s been around for a while (year+) so I don&#039;t think it&#039;s directly &#039;trunk&#039; related.</p><p>System uses ADSL with PPPoA - long line so sync is around 2.5mbit incoming, 0.5mbit outgoing.&nbsp; Traffic to/from Internet via lan/wlan achieves those rates no problem.&nbsp; Traffic from internet to process running on router achieves 2.5mbit incoming rate no problem.&nbsp; Traffic TO internet from process running on router seems to be rate limited to about a tenth of the outbound sync rate ie. 40kbps when it should be more 400kbps.</p><p>This is evidenced with &#039;netperf/netserver&#039;, also &#039;scp&#039; and &#039;ssh&#039; sessions are extremely laggy.&nbsp; The Luci web interface also understandably suffers.&nbsp; </p><p>As previously mentioned, external devices (e.g. ipad/PC) can do speedtests and acheive &#039;line rates&#039; in both directions, so why/what could be causing router processes only to be unable to send data quickly?</p><p>time dmesg &gt;/dev/null<br />real&nbsp; &nbsp; 0m 0.07s<br />user&nbsp; &nbsp; 0m 0.03s<br />sys&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0m 0.01s</p><p>time dmesg &gt;/tmp/zzz<br />real&nbsp; &nbsp; 0m 0.05s<br />user&nbsp; &nbsp; 0m 0.02s<br />sys&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0m 0.02s</p><p> time dmesg &gt;/mnt/sda2/zzz<br />real&nbsp; &nbsp; 0m 0.06s<br />user&nbsp; &nbsp; 0m 0.03s<br />sys&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0m 0.02s</p><p>dmesg<br />real&nbsp; &nbsp; 0m 39.86s!!!!<br />user&nbsp; &nbsp; 0m 0.04s<br />sys&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0m 0.03s</p><p>I stuck wireshark on the receiving end and saw no retries/lost packets or anything other than to suggest a slow link....but it isn&#039;t *that* slow!</p><p>I&#039;d be really grateful for any ideas/pointers.</p>									</div>
