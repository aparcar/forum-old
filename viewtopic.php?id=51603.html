					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;ve recently acquired a Ubiquiti UniFi and wish to connect it to an OpenWRT device (AirRouter) that uses the switch chip mentioned in the title.</p><p>The port I connected the UniFi to is configured as follows:</p><p>VLAN 2 - Untagged (This is the network that the controller and my machine connect to)</p><p>VLAN 3 - Tagged (This network is the &#039;general&#039; network, people that aren&#039;t guests)</p><p>VLAN 4 - Tagged (Guest network)</p><p>OpenWRT has been set up to handle DHCP and DNS and perform NAT for all three interfaces. I have confirmed that these functions are working properly on all the above networks by setting the other VLANs to untagged on other ports and testing my machine on them.</p><p>I then applied the VLAN configuration I mentioned above to the port that the UniFi would be plugged into.</p><p>The controller was able to see the AP, and the network I configured for the untagged VLAN worked as expected.</p><p>My issue occured when I attempted to join a device to either of the SSIDs for the two tagged networks. They authenticated properly to the AP, but failed to receive IP addresses or even communicate with the OpenWRT device. I looked at the Network -&gt; Interfaces tab in LuCI, and nothing was being received on either of the two interfaces that were tagged. The transmit counter went up every so often (DHCP broadcasts?), but nothing was being received, even though I was attempting to re-acquire the DHCP leases on the wireless clients connected to the tagged SSIDs.</p><p>I then removed the cable from the UniFi and plugged it into my machine. I configured my machine to tag packets for either VLAN 3 or 4. Still, nothing was being received, only transmitted.</p><p>Any ideas anyone?</p><p>Also, this device is running 12.09.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>creepus</strong> on 14 Jul 2014, 03:49)</p>
