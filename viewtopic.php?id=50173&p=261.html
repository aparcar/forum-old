					<p>@dlang If I use ftp I do not see a problem. It just bothered me as to why this was happening and I had already verified a large transfer through dropbear failed also.

					<p>Well, I&#039;ve successfully built and am running the CC branch @ current.&nbsp; I was attempting to get the 10.0.3.7 mwlwifi driver to integrate and compile in there but its not being happy for me.&nbsp; However whenever that gets pushed to the CC trunk, I&#039;m ready to build away!</p>									</div>

					<p>@ iwrotcode you need to get to a higher channel to get more output turn off auto on the 5 ghz channel and set it to 157&nbsp; after applying you should be able to go as high as 1000mw (If you are in the states)</p><p>run &quot;iw phy1 info&quot; in putty at the end you will see 30db you can only get that on the higher channels.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>northbound</strong> on 21 Jul 2015, 23:06)</p>
