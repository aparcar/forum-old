					<p>I am trying to recover a bricked Buffalo WBR-G54 using JTAG with HairyDairyMaid&#039;s utility.&nbsp; Long story short, I have wiped the entire flash, and I am now trying to flash a backup of the CFE.&nbsp; The problem is that about 5% into the flash, it hangs up.&nbsp; I can unplug the AC and replug to get it going, but it eventually hangs again.&nbsp; If I cancel and read what I have written of the CFE using JTAG, it is corrupted.&nbsp; Every few bytes I get &quot;FF 5A 8F&quot; in place of the bytes that should be there.&nbsp; What is weird is that if I flash a CFE consisting of 256KB worth of null (00) bytes, it flashes fine--never hangs up.&nbsp; It then reads back and exhibits no corruption.</p><p>Prior to getting the JTAG cable, I tried pin shorting, which I now regret since I believe that may have damaged the flash, causing the above issues.&nbsp; I have tried various options with the JTAG utility in both Linux and WinXP, to no avail.&nbsp; Any thoughts?</p>									</div>
