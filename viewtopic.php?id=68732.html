					<p>TP-Link has started putting &quot;locks&quot; in their firmware to reject third-party firmware.&nbsp; Try downgrading to the 151014 version of stock firmware found on TP-Link&#039;s website.&nbsp; If that does not work, you will need to TFTP flash, which appears to be possible without opening the case.<br />I have a couple of C7&#039;s on order and am wondering if I will also encounter this issue.</p>									</div>

					<p>Not only that, some C7 v2 include the RAM chipset which is not supported in 15.05, you&#039;ll be better of flashing Gargoyle (if you need Web UI) or LEDE (if you can copy-paste a few commands to CLI).</p>									</div>

					<p>I believe DD also has a kernel patched up to work on the new flash chip, but again you will have to install luci manually. LEDE has locale specific images (US,EU) to deal with that issue.</p>									</div>

					<p>Has anyone been able to build OpenWrt to work on the newer Archer C7 V2? I was able to get the LEDE build installed on my C7 but I would prefer to keep using my customized OpenWrt build if possible. If it is possible can anyone point to build examples so I can try to add the fix to my build.</p>									</div>

					<p>You don&#039;t really say what issue you are experiencing. Assuming CC build:</p><p>If new flash chip issue:<br /> -original <a href="https://git.openwrt.org/p=openwrt.git;a=shortlog?p=openwrt.git;a=commit;h=8fdb8b8531d4288b3edc379fd59cda93f2a15ce5">patch</a> to deal with issue.

					<p>Thanks for the tips @Villeneuve, and if one is using BB 14.07, is there a patch for it that will deal with the new flash chip?</p><p>I already have the ath10K and the country code dealt with, looks like it the chip and or some other build/signing thing.</p>									</div>
