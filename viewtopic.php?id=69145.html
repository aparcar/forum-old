					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have a very strange issue for the last few weeks and I was able to narrow the issue down to my OpenWRT router.&nbsp; I hope that somebody might have an idea what is going on.<br />I few weeks ago I upgraded my internet connection to fiber and got from the provider an modem with it. Overall the modem is not very good esp the WIFI configuration options are terrible. I had used before for years without trouble a Buffalo WBMR-HP-G300H with OpenWRT. My issue was that the Buffalo did not supported the fiber connection so I decided to use the provided router only as a modem and use the Buffalo as the main access point for all of mine devices. So of I went and configured the WIFI on the Buffalo device, forwarded all traffic for the internet to the modem and turned WIFI and DHCP on the provided modem of. <br />All of this work quite nicely and overall is the setup working quite well. The issue which I have now is specifically with WhatsUp and possibly with a Fitbit Aria Scale, but lets concentrate for now on WhatsUp. The service itself is working in the sense that I can send and receive messages.<br />What is not working is sending and receiving of media files like pictures. most of the time the files are not send or received. I played around with the firewall settings on the Buffalo but the behavior is the same, sometimes (seldom) it works but mostly it dose not. <br />I went now systematically trough my setup again and the issue only happens when I re-introduce the OpenWRT router.<br />The router running on OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05.1.</p><p>I would appreciate any help on how I can identify what the issue is?</p><p>Thanks<br />Rene</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi guys, first of thank you for your help. <br />So I played around with the MTU settings and applied the MSS clamping setting. I connected my laptop via cable to the modem and tried to identify the MTU for the modem.<br />&lt;ping google_com -f -l MTU Size&gt;<br />It seams that the MTU size 1464 for the modem. That is the first time that the packets go through without fragmentation.<br />I used that value then on the buffalo. The results are mixed. I would say in around 50+% sending is working and sometimes even receiving the pictures. Would I have to lower the setting on the buffalo to get to a stable situation? I tested it with 1440 as well but same results.<br />On the firewall question, what would be the best way to send you the details, but I went essentially with the default settings plus: Forward is set to Accept and MSS clamping active.</p>									</div>
