					<p>Seems to me the wifi crashes when the last iphone disconnects.. I have a house full of them, and that&#039;s been my observation. As for load and CPU, the long term monitoring shows this system runs pretty much idle most of the time. Of course I don&#039;t have much installed other than the RC2, so I&#039;m not creating much demand by watching video and surfing the web.</p><p>My last testing with RC2 shows load was not high before either of the 2 crashes.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://personalpages.tds.net/~davidc502/WRT1900ac_Stock_Image/Report-12_49-06_21_2015-1.jpg" alt="LOAD Graph" /></span></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davidc502</strong> on 21 Jun 2015, 20:57)</p>
