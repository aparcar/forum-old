					<p>In the ImageBuilderHowto documentation mention that It will not work if i use root account to generate an image ...</p><p>What&#039;s the symptom if i use root account to build one ??</p><p>Bcoz now i finished building one image but once i install it into my wl500g, it will reboot itself after i issue &quot;telnet&quot; command. So, i cannot do anything with it and i have to roll back.</p><p>But from this image, i didn&#039;t use root account to build it. I use root account to create some custom files but i&#039;ve already changed its owner and group to nonroot before build the image.</p><p>Is it possible to be a root cause of this symptom? or did anyone face this problems before ??</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Attojung</p><p>Well despite what you say the documentation says; I&#039;ve build (RC4 and RC5) for WRT54G and successfully ran my images using, interchangeably, root and non-root accounts.<br />Although we most likely selected, from menuconfig,&nbsp; different packages which might explain why it worked for me.</p>									</div>
