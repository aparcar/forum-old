					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a WDR3600 and with the stock firmware it kept dropping my Hauwei Ascend P6 off the wifi... I flashed Gargoyle and the problem went away... Then I flash openWRT Attitude Adjustment and the problem was back.</p><p>I have tried various different configurations, but I just can&#039;t seem to find something that will give me stable wifi for my phone. Everything else works fine.</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>									</div>

					<p>I configured the router using Luci, which is a complete cop out...</p><p>Streaming to my PS3 also does not work, somehow my ps3 behaves exactly the same at the P6... For now I flashed back to Gargoyle until I have a day or so to really work through the config.</p><p>I actually have pretty good Linux skills, so I should really just spend some time reading and figuring out what is going on</p>									</div>
