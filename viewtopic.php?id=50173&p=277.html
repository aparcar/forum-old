The newer systems seem to be just connecting them to the switch and using&nbsp; a slightly larger switch. There are advantages and disadvantages to this. The ability to treat the port labelled as &#039;WAN&#039; the same as any other port can be a _very_ nice advantage. This also lets you redefine some of the LAN ports to actually be on the WAN network if you need to plug something else in there (say a backup path the the outside). But it does slightly complicate the configuration, and it causes grief for people trying to detect the actual data rate (as the switch buffers traffic a little bit)</p>									</div>
