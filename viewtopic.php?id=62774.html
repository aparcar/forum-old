					<p>Hello I am trying to understand if anything require to achieve serial connection between 1900ACv2 running latest OpenWRT and Putty.</p><p>I connected 4 pins to the router and other end Serial to USB connector. For some reason Putty can;&#039;t connect to the router. I mean I just tried with Proper COM port in my case it&#039;s COM3 and using 115200 band. I also tried Hardware ,Xoff/Xoff settings .... nothing worked.</p><p>Does anyone can suggest something ? Because I bricked my router few hours back and It took forever to get it going again I think with serial I can fix stuff faster. In my understanding serial connection is like Low level connection to the router where I can do anything I want just like with Ethernet connection but if network settings are messed up like it was in my case nothing starts. Network not working, GUI not working. Serial is only choice .... correct ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Have you tried swapping TX and RX? Also, you should not connect all four pins from your USB-TTL cable. You should not provide power to the board -- I think that&#039;s universally a red cable. Don&#039;t plug that one in. You should connect only TX, RX and GND.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not aware of how to unbrick the 1900AC with a USB to TTL cable (In my case, I have used the &quot;power on/off many times&quot; recovery method, and it works fine) but...</p><p>I personally use and recommend <a href="http://logmett.com/tera-term-the-latest-version">Tera Term</a> instead of putty.<br />Also, as leitec said, <strong>DON&#039;T</strong> connect the power pin, it&#039;s dangerous and can destroy the router!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>angelos</strong> on 17 Feb 2016, 01:13)</p>

					<p>IT&#039;s crazy guys. After pulling my hair out for almost 2 days I managed to reboot router .... guess how ?</p><p>All I did I disconnected Serial to USB connecter from my computer .......that&#039;s all it took. Also I just looked at the manual. You&#039;re correct red is 5v power ..... oh boy ,,,,, I think 1900ac maximum allowed is 3.3 v ......</p>									</div>
