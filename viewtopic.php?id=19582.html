					<p>Hello, I am trying to install OpenWRT on a&nbsp; Belkin G+ MIMO Router, AKA F5D9230-4, in order to turn it into a linux server mounting a remote Windows filesystem via SSHFS (the Windows machine has OpenSSH installed for the SSH host). According to <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=19021">this page</a> it is compatible with the Airlink AR525W firmware image. The Airlink AR525W in turn has a RDC R321x(-G) CPU, which is supposed to be x86 compatible. My questions are:</p><p>1. Does this mean that the F5D9230-4 can use the Kamikaze x86-2.6 firmware image due to its x86 compatibility?<br />2. What module/package should I use to add SSHFS capability to the F5D9230-4 (May I use the normal x86 module)?<br />3. What package may I use to put a lighthttpd server with PHP5 on the router (How would I compile both against uClibc)?<br />4. May I place the lighthttpd, PHP5, and SQL (MySQL or SQLite) binaries and database in the remote filesystem and have the server run them from there? How would I accomplish this (I&#039;m especially concerned for the SQL database, how to keep the database in the remote filesystem)?</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br />JWRT</p>									</div>
