					<p>Good evening, I&#039;m new here, this is my first post, I want to make a small network with colleagues, and bought some equipment of tp-link (TL-WA5210G) d openwrt version that works well it is 8.09.2 then downloaded and installed, this step has already been, now I downloaded the updated sources olsrd 0.6.6.1 and it was quite complicated to build, finally had to create links to &quot;/ home / agb / openwrt / atheros / staging_dir&quot; believe is the original location on the developer&#039;s computer, but ultimately, creating symlinks everything worked out, but would like to know where can I download the sdk package to version 8.09.2 atheros openwrt without the old tracks, no need to make symlinks. </p><p>I am Brazilian and I speak English, I apologize, to using google translator. </p><p>Att <br />Anderson Junior</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello anderson, I&#039;ve got a question. How did you install openwrt on the WA5210G ? Did you upload the firmware using web interface or did you reflashed the spi chip. Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>
