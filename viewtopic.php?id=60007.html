					<p>Hi Guys an hello! I hope you can help me with my problem!</p><p>That&#039;s the situation: my uncle has a small lan at home with 2 desktops and printers, internet via a broadband modem with router/switch, no wifi.<br />Now he wants wifi added for his son.<br />Ok, no rocket sience. I had an old unused Linksys WRT54GL. I flashed it with an OpenWrt image with LuCI, set LAN interface to static IP (same subnet as modem of course), gateway and DNS to IP of broadband router, disabled DHCP Server (because DHCP is enabled on broadband router), WIFI to AP and interface to DHCP.<br />Everything works fine, WIFI clients get IP from LAN and can access internet.<br />But here comes the problem: my uncle wants to block WIFI clients from accessing LAN, they should just use internet. I tried firewall settings and iptables, but nothing works. I&#039;m not a newbie to OpenWrt but still a beginner.</p><p>Any ideas? Many thx!</p>									</div>

					<p>I could be mistaken, but I do not think OpenWrt is ready to filter traffic in the context of bridged interfaces, so you will probably have to configure iptables yourself from scratch. After a quick search on Google, this page seems to have a nice explanation on how to do it: <a href="http://www.sjdjweis.com/linux/bridging/">http://www.sjdjweis.com/linux/bridging/</a></p><p>Hope this helps!</p>									</div>

					<p>VLANs would be the best way to do this, it&#039;s exactly what they&#039;re made for. You need the WRT54GL on a separate VLAN from the rest of the network, so that all it can see is the gateway router.</p><p>The problem is that this need to be configured on the gateway router, not the access point. Does it, or can it run OpenWRT? If not, I guess you can check the features of whatever firmware it runs - but most home routers don&#039;t enable this functionality, unfortunately.</p><p>If you have no success with the VLANs on the gateway, I guess your other option would be to reset the WRT54GL to it&#039;s default configuration, plug it&#039;s WAN port into the LAN, and set up some firewall rules to drop traffic to IPs in the LAN subnet (except the gateway of course). It&#039;s icky because it&#039;s 2 layers of NAT, but it should work.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Degeneratescum</strong> on 2 Oct 2015, 23:04)</p>

					<p>Hmmm.&nbsp; With the default OpenWRT config, the WAN port should be configured as a DHCP client, so if you plug it into a LAN port on the gateway, it should get an IP assigned from your home network as the &quot;ISP&quot;.</p><p>Maybe there&#039;s an IP range clash? Make sure the Linksys LAN ip range is set to a different subnet than the gateway gives out.</p><p>Edit: I originally said IP range, but to be clearer, it has to be a different subnet. So if the gateway is on 192.168.1.1, subnet mask 255.255.255.0, then the Linksys could use 192.168.2.1 and 255.255.255.0.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Degeneratescum</strong> on 2 Oct 2015, 23:59)</p>

					<p>If the linksys uses the same subnet as the gateway it can&#039;t route, see my edit above.</p><p>You want the standard LAN configuration of static IP and DHCP server, but if the ip of the gateway was, say 192.168.1.1, then make the linksys LAN 192.168.2.1.</p><p>What we&#039;re aiming for here is a situation where you can set firewall rules to drop all traffic to and from the gateway&#039;s subnet, except the gateway itself. Then you will have achieved the isolation of networks that you desire. Without VLANs, it wasn&#039;t possible to do it at the mac level with the networks bridged, so instead we&#039;re doing it with separated networks at the IP level. Hence the need for different IP subnets.</p><p>BTW, just thinking aloud here, I think eduperez&#039;s suggestion above about manual configuration of iptables is also a valid solution, probably too complicated for a beginner, but maybe the best from a technical standpoint if you have the time to figure it out. I also think there might be another solution using relayd, but I suspect this will perform worse than 2 layers of NAT.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Degeneratescum</strong> on 3 Oct 2015, 00:35)</p>

					<p>OK, we&#039;ve got to a point where you can use the firewall to block the traffic. Unfortunately I haven&#039;t a lot of experience with firewall configuration, so maybe this is where someone else can help you, or you can study the firewall docs and figure it out.</p><p>What I do know is that the order of the firewall rules is important. You custom rules will need to go first.</p><p>1. Rules to allow traffic to and from the gateway.<br />2. Rules to block traffic to the subnet 192.168.1.* (won&#039;t affect the gateway traffic as it has already been accepted at 1.)<br />3. The standard rules that will already be configured for all other traffic (won&#039;t affect the LAN blocking as the packets have already been blocked at 2.)</p>									</div>
