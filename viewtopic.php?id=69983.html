					<p>Hello,<br />I´m new in this forum and I need help. Yesterday I received a TP LINK TL MR3040 V2 Router. I flashed it with the newest firmware (DDServer OpenWrt MR3040 V2 Factory 0.13) I found on the qdslr site, because I want to conect my Canon. Everything worked fine untill I had to enable wlan. This wasn´t possible and on LUci I saw the message &quot;Wireless is disabled or not associated&quot;. After a while checking to solve the problem I flashed back to TP-LINk original firmware via Apple Terminal.&nbsp; All configurations I di via lan cable in AP mode<br />With the original firmware it´s no problem to connect the wlan if there is a LAN cable connected to the internet.<br />Is the someone can help me?</p><p>Best regards<br />Frank</p>									</div>
