					<p>@Heinz<br />I&#039;ve compiled and done some initial testing on your patch. wan interface indeed works. as well as wifi and leds. the default network config, does not use vlan but it will likely work once its added to /etc/config/network .<br />I suspect the reason that the LTE interface is working without any tweak, is that it&#039;s been setup correctly in the original stock firmware web GUI before switching to lede. do you have any idea how one can communicate with this LTE device in lede and possibly change parameters and settings? i believe the stock firmware was doing that via /dev/ttyUSBx .<br />i also can not find any package containing <strong>adb</strong> in lede.<br />right now with this patch, this device is in a &#039;somewhat&#039; workable state. as long as you setup the LTE parameters correctly in stock firmware, it works fine once switched to lede.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Hamy</strong> on 25 Sep 2016, 16:01)</p>

					<p>@walx<br />It sure looks similar. however, without accessing to the terminal, there is not much can be done.<br />One of the few things that could be done without opening up the device, is doing a traceroute. see how fast the second hop response is and whats it&#039;s ip address(for this model is 192.168.225.1), we could at least see if the they&#039;re using the same method (or even the same LTE card). Also see if the second hop, answers to dns queries.</p>									</div>

					<p>@nico-nl<br />Also check MR200 openwrt wiki page for more info. it is indeed way safer and easier to use a tested working firmware for initially switching to lede than preparing one yourself (this is mainly because you need to include bootloader at the very beginning of the firmware and any mistake on that part would brick your router). after the initial switch, the usual sysupgrade methods could be used to upgrade to the newer versions (or even switch to openwrt if it ever adds the device support).<br />Also note that the provided back-to-stock firmware file by Heinz, is a sysupgrade compatible one (meaning it should be used inside a running lede/openwrt instance to do the switch). DO NOT use the tftp method with that file or you&#039;re gonna brick your router as it does not include bootloader.</p><p>@Heinz<br />Do you plan to keep those files in your google drive? if so, i could add the link to the wiki for new users to use them instead of instructing them how to prepare one.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Hamy</strong> on 28 Oct 2016, 07:01)</p>

					<p>I am looking for short-cuts. All this stuff here are pretty technical and I do not understand one bit of it. LEDE or not it still is same problem.</p><p>If anyone is willing to help configure my&nbsp; TP-Link Archer MR200&nbsp; to enable me change the IMEI and also have OpenWRT or it&#039;s alternative I will be more than happy. I got this router because of its sim slot. I searched here on the router page and didn&#039;t click for details i thought if it is listed it is supported my bad and i bought 3 of them.</p><p>I am will to pay for this service via bitcoin/paypal/western union.Alternatively if there is any other router that has support for OpenWRT with sim card slot please recommend me. I can&#039;t find USB dongle here in my country as most providers uses HUaWEI rooter these days here.</p><p>I need this urgently please.</p>									</div>
