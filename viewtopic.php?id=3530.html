					<p>Hi all!<br />&nbsp; As You probably have figured out I have some problems with my motorola.<br />I got it bricked by some stupid errors while playing with nvram. At that point now I know everything was very easy to recover. But I have (probably) used a wrong image to recover the firmware and the router died.<br />So I built a JTAG cable , got the hairydairymaid debrick tool and I have stopped at the reflashing procedure. <br />I have two choices : reflash the CFE or the whole flash . <br />As I have read on the forum CFE is the bootloader. I have only some limited&nbsp; idea what does&nbsp; the whole flash contain ( CFE + NVRAM + some things I don&#039;t recall).<br />I have two questions :<br />Does any of binary images&nbsp; ( openwrt-motorola-jffs2-4MB.bin openwrt-motorola-jffs2-8MB.bin openwrt-motorola-squashfs.bin ) have anything in common with any of those two above ? Can it help me at the debrick utility ?&nbsp; I know that if I had a WRT54 I would need to find a CFE ( which&nbsp; &nbsp;I have already found over the forum).</p><p>If binaries are no good where can I find those CFE files ? Correct me if I am wrong - but if a CFE is a bootloader and I will put a wrong version on my router I can say goodbye even through JTAG cable.... ? </p><p>I will really appreciate any help.<br />Michal</p>									</div>

					<p>Michal,</p><p>First, before anything else, try erasing the NVRAM settings through the HairyDairyMaid JTAG utility.&nbsp; On my v3, the bootloader recreated everything from defaults on the subsequent boot.</p><p>At this point, hook up a serial terminal to the router ( pinout in this thread: <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/forum/remark,14434922">http://www.dslreports.com/forum/remark,14434922</a> ) and see if the CFE utility is booting.&nbsp; If you didn&#039;t enable boot_wait previously, you will have to keep pressing enter very quickly and try to get a CFE&gt; prompt.&nbsp; Turn boot_wait on, commit to NVRAM, and reboot.</p><p>Then try to TFTP the default Motorola image to the router.&nbsp; You&#039;ll know, based on the serial console output, when to start the TFTP and when it is successful.</p><p>It is impossible to disable the JTAG interface--that is hardware that&#039;s built in to the processor.&nbsp; If the CFE is NOT booting, that&#039;s beyond my expertise.</p><p>Hope this helps,</p><p>Tim</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>whitepines</strong> on 4 Dec 2005, 04:49)</p>

					<p>Hi again ! <br />It is gonna be a longer one - I will share some thing I have discovered.<br />I did reseted the NVRAM settings - I thought it worked.<br />I am having problems with the serial cable - I asked my neighbour who knows more about electronics and he made the cable using some kit - but it does not work - I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s the constructions fault or the broken CFE. <br />Question 1 : If the CFE is broken should I still see some output from the terminal ? <br />Coming back to resetting parts of flash:<br />I did a simple test - I wanted to know how the CFE resets NVRAM settings - in my case it does nothing . I have erased the NVRAM , reseted , erased WHOLEFLASH , reseted , flashed&nbsp; CFE, reseted. Then I tried backing up the NVRAM - guess what - it was the same as the NVRAM before erasing- that surprised me.<br />I got confused - I wasn&#039;t sure if the JTAG really flashes the chip. That was the begging of couple bad steps that I took.<br />I was looking through couple of guides and I found that my backed up&nbsp; CFE has a common thing with all the images -the &quot;HRD0&quot;. So I figured out to do a test ( that I REALLY DON&#039;T RECOMMEND) - I wanted to take get CFE out of regullar firmware images. I did &quot; dd if=openwrt-motorola-squashfs.bin of=CFE.BIN count=512 &quot;.&nbsp; Then I flashed the chip wth that. I was yesterdays evening- router stopped reacting to Debrick utility - I had to use the extra options like the chip model argument and so on ... But still - only limited usage- flashing , erasing was freezing at the first sector.I thought I bricked it for good. <br />But today in the morning I figured out to give it another chance - I managed to restore the original WHOLEFLASH. But the trick is that after that backups were giving me nulls of FF&#039;s. After couple hours of leaving it unplugged I managed to get a backup of CFE from the router ( even cuple of times) - but It always had only the right beginning (like 1%) and the rest was garbage ( like FF or some strange pattern of couple signs). Now I&#039;m waiting till the morning to flash the CFE again.<br />Cuple of things that I would like to share with others who may have some similar problems:<br />First thing after reading the HairyDairyMaid_WRT54G_v2_DeBrick_Guide is to MAKE A BACKUP OF CFE NVRAM and WHOLEFLASH - it can really help.<br />Don&#039;t play with the CFE - if You manage to put some garbage on it&#039;s place You will have a lot of problems.<br />I don&#039;t know why but router responds for JTAG commands after plugging in when all the led are on&nbsp; - that&#039;s when I manage to flash it ( it does not halt on first section)<br />If Your router does not respond to JTAG - leave it for couple of hours TOTALLY unplugged (including JTAG SERIAL and POWER)&nbsp; - it should help a bit.<br />&nbsp; I would suggest also suggest to add a sentence in bold somewhere in the beginning of the Install Docs for Motorola about turning the boot_wait on as a must - it won&#039;t hurt anybody and may only help.</p><p>What I am still asking for is the CFE.BIN and the NVRAM.BIN. I found couple of sites where You can download those for Linksys models but I guess not really many people use WR850G.<br />Can somebody&nbsp; who has them contact me pls??&nbsp; What I can offer is nothing special but once I confirm it working I will place it one couple of ftp servers where somebody else with that problem may get them ...</p><p>Finally - because of today&#039;s date - I would like to wish everybody merry Christmas , all the best to openwrt developers and users... </p><p>Michal</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Hans!<br />I am afraid that my CFE will not really help You - I have a wr850g (v3) and I am not really sure if that can work on GP models. If You really want to give it a try - let me know.<br />I guess it is better to try talking with people the same hardware (LSU_guy, RockyGryphon, rreiner, robertmena). Then just ask for the following dump &quot;dd if=/dev/mtdblock/0 of=/tmp/cfe.bin&quot; (not everybody is so &quot;lucky&quot; to have the jtag cable:P).</p><p>Did You try manually setting the addresses? <br />As far as I know the CFE is like the bootloader - if it is corrupted. than You don&#039;t have to worry about incorrect settings - there are not going to be any settings. My best shoot would be going back to the motorola firmware - that would probably fix Your problems but DO NOT do it over wireless connection....</p><p>Cheers <br />Michal</p><p>PS. Seth7 - did You fix You box ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Of course! Sorry, I&#039;m not that selfish <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> I&#039;m a bit desperate, only.</p><p>So, as I said, I have a Motorola WR850G v3, with intel chipset inside. I had installed the last version of dd-wrt (dd-wrt v23 SP2) and then set the overclock option to 300 MHz by accident. Since then, my router has a fixed (not blinking) red power light. It responds to pings for the first 10 seconds after turned-on, but I reflashed it a thousand times, even by the wan port, waiting more than 15 minutes for automatic rebooting, and nothing changed. I don&#039;t know what to do.</p><p>Things that I already have tried:</p><p>- Flashed with original Motorola Firmware (Motorola_WR850_6.1.4 and Motorola_WR850G_4.03) -&gt; Nothing;<br />- Flashed with dd-wrt micro version (dd-wrt.v23_micro_moto.bin) -&gt; It will responds to pings ever. But I&#039;m unable to access the admin pages or telnet console neither.<br />- Flashed with dd-wrt mini and generic versions -&gt; Nothing.<br />- Flashed with openwrt-wr850g-jffs2.bin -&gt; The wireless light will turn on and nothing else. No ping.<br />- Flashed with openwrt-wr850g-squashfs.bin -&gt; Same as jffs2.<br />- Put the router in the freezer more than 12 hours, trying to ping and enter admin pages -&gt; Then the red power light turns to green again (!!!), but I&#039;m unable to even ping <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" />( After 30 secs the light turns to red.<br />- Remove the header section (8 first bytes before the &quot;HDR0&quot;) of all firmwares above using a hexadecimal editor. Then waited more than 15 minutes -&gt; Nothing.<br />- Pressed reset quickly / slowly / after / during / between the above tests -&gt; Nothing.<br />- Kick the router -&gt; Just kidding... hehehe.</p><p>I have build my own JTAG cable and backed-up CFE and NVRAM. I was advised by dd-wrt documentation to not clear the nvram using mtd command. So, I&#039;m afraid to make my router totally unrecoverable by (another) mistake of mine. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>I&#039;m really lost. Think I need the WHOLEFLASH.BIN but I&#039;m hopeless.... maybe I have fried it.</p><p>I tried to find it (the wholeflash) googling, but nothing. I found your posts <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Thanks Yans and Seth7... your posts are really helpful for anyone who have Motorola&#039;s WR580G.</p><p>[]&#039;s</p><p>Vinicius</p><p>PS: I don&#039;t use to write in english.

					<p>Hi ! <br />toca13579 :<br />I took a look at our earlier chat <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=5776">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=5776</a> . You wrote that &quot;router is working again&quot;. So what has happened that it is not working now ? Are You using stripped images for tftp ? I understand that You want to just get the router back ? Are You following <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Motorola/WR850G?highlight=%28motorola%29#head-624e5453dd365f21b3ad5c9122f9177d8a9bdaf1">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har … 7d8a9bdaf1</a> ? Don&#039;t use the openwrt firmware via tftp - in my case that was impossible - any other images (dd wrt minimal or original motorola) worked but not openwrt. <br />About these errors You are getting - can You copy them exactly ? We will try to compare them with other peoples problems..... <br />And my simple answer for Your question - You are probably unable to flash it because You forgot about some small detail... That is at least the most common thing in my case.</p><p>vinicius.vbf:<br />I was using unbuffered cable. What happens if You erase a block - let&#039;s say nvram. You power off the router and then dump the image of nvram - does it have any interesting pattern - like whole image consisting of FF or 00 ? </p><p>Good luck to both of You guys !<br />Michal</p>									</div>

					<p>It works!!! Yahooooooo! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>What I did:</p><p>- Tried to use the hdm unbrick tool v48 (I was using v45) -&gt; Nothing. The nvram backup differs from nvram.bin (provided by Michal aka yans)</p><p>- Compiled a patched version of the unbrick tool. This version was used with an unbuffered cable (not wiggler), so, the only changes was the delay function and the uses of it. </p><p>- Tried to flash CFE.BIN and NVRAM.BIN -&gt; Success! The versions are the same. The constant red power light returns. Only one bad news: I can&#039;t ping it yet.</p><p>- Tried to erase NVRAM -&gt; Error. I don&#039;t know why, but the program ALWAYS marks 0 (zero) blocks to erasing. So, the only way to erase nvram (in my case) was erase the wholeflash.</p><p>- Tried to erase the WHOLEFLASH -&gt; The program halts (I don&#039;t know why). It simply breaks and stay as is.</p><p>- Tried to erase the WHOLEFLASH with the unmodified unbrick tool v48&nbsp; -&gt; Success! The wholeflash was correctly erased, including the nvram. From this moment on I always used the v48 unmodified version of the unbrick tool and it works perfectly. I think the modified v45 version has unlocked or unbricked something in my intel flash chip. The red power light became green again.</p><p>- Tried to flash CFE.BIN and NVRAM.BIN using the unmodified v48 tool -&gt; Success! The versions are the same, red power light is there. I can&#039;t ping.</p><p>- Repeat the last operations some times...</p><p>- Now its more than 01:00 am, and I&#039;m still awake trying to ping the router. So I got to my bed and look at the router board one last time... and.... what a f*ck.... WHAT IS THAT?? There is a particle of weld between the pins of the network chipset (not the intel or bcm ones, the another one, close to the LAN ports). It could stopped there when I desoldering some pins (I have to change the JTAG contact pins because the first pins broken). I removed it and FINALLY I COULD PING MY ROUTER!!!!!! OOHHHHH YEAH!!!!!!!</p><p>- Just flashed it with the original motorola firmware 4.07 without the first 8 bytes (before HDR0) like Michal said.. wait 3 seconds.... automatic reboot... and... voi-la!!! Now I have a dynamic IP address provided by the router and can browse in the admin pages!!!</p><p>Thanks a lot Michal aka yans!!!!! I could never fix it without your help. I&#039;ll never forget it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vinicius.vbf</strong> on 1 Nov 2006, 16:34)</p>

					<p>&gt;&gt;Do You really have such a beautiful MAC address ?<br />That&#039;s what it is set to. I think it is either in the CFE you sent me, or maybe because my NVRAM is erased.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Your wr850g is v3 - right ? <br />Yes. v3 with the black casing.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Does this output occur with tftp flashing or is it a standard that You are getting ? The part after &quot;Invalid boot &gt;&gt;block on disk&quot; is the most interesting...<br />This was after one tftp flash, then I got the Invalid boot block and tried another tftp.

If I erase NVRAM alone, it comes back all FF.</p><p>&gt;&gt;And You are saying that programming the wholeflash is not giving any results also .... ? <br />I am not sure on the process to make a wholeflash.bin file, and my router was screwed up before I could make a backup of it.</p><p>I am at a loss on the fact that the process worked the first time but not now.</p>									</div>

					<p>toca13579 I had to leave the town - I will be back on Sunday.<br />I will try to get the wholeflsh for You then. Or maybe vinicius.vbf could get one for You ... ? <br />Then we will try helping You with more detailed instructions - right now I don&#039;t remember all the possibilities and there are too many way to try (playing with cfe command line, tftp, flashing nvram, cfe , patching the debrick tool etc....).<br />Until then You can :<br />a) try playing with cfe command line - maybe there are some manuals for that ? Maybe it is worth asking people like nbd,mbm,Kaloz etc about it ? <br />b) verify that the debrick tool is working correctly (I am worried that You are getting different reads after erasing different parts of flash [00,FF]). Take a hex editor - edit something harmless in the NVRAM.bin line the name of the router or something like that. Flash the router with it and read it back - then find the variable that You have changed - has it been correctly flashed ?</p><p>Michal</p><p>PS.<br />Maybe we should respond to <br /><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=7839">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=7839</a></p>									</div>
