					<p>Hy </p><p>I am thinking on building a more redundant home network My question would be as following.</p><p>As sincs my ISP doesnt allow multiple Cable modems, but allows 3 IPs to be assigned at one time. So the idea I got</p> <br /><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|------Router 1 (VRRP) Main&nbsp; &nbsp;----------Wifi-------------------|<br />-----Modem-------Switch----|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;== Repeater <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|------Router 2 (VRRP) Standby&nbsp; &nbsp; -----Wifi-------------------|</p><p>Both routers would have a seperate wifi and if one fails the second would take over. As I investigated and learnt on BCMSN, VRRP cannot track interfaces and isnt able to switch over the wifi.</p><p>So comes the interesting part...1 room further there is going to be a Repeater, so signals can get to the bedroom better, cause sometimes I like to work from bed (I know I am a lazy bastard....)<br />My question following<br />If the repeater (of course all 3 running openwrt Kamikaze) has an Ap configured for the main, and a virtual AP configured for the Standby one, Is it possible to configure the Repeater to work for both AP&#039;S on different Channels or do all 3 AP&#039;s need to be configured for the same channel?</p><p>Is there some better solution already out there on openwrt (VRRP) that I might have not heard of?</p><p>I know Modem and Switch are SPOF, but these are the steps where I can start on implementing redundancy.... I wish I could go with 2 modems but ISP wont allow it ..:(</p>									</div>
