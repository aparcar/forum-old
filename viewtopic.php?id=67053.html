					<p>Dear all,</p><p>I am currently working on QSDK and Atheros Wifi board (similar to AP135). I used to work with Openwrt, and I notice that QSDK is mainly based on Openwrt 12.09 AA version. Although QSDK looks like Openwrt, but I still got confused on the code structure of QSDK. I followed the instructions on the QSDK wiki page () at CodeAurora to clone the source codes of QSDK project. However, I got stuck with some problems and I am wondering if anyone can teach me what to do.</p><p>1) which [manifest] should I used? In CA&#039;s gitweb I can see a lot of .xml files such as BANANA, COCONUT, or ARUGULA_AA_CS. I think these are different branches but I cannot find the explaining documentation. What do these names mean and which one should I use? Should I used the latest .xml?</p><p>2) I clone a QSDK source file (manifest caf_AU_LINUX_QSDK_RELEASE_BANANA_SW_TARGET_ALL.2.7.069.xml) but I cannot download some important packages like qca-wifi and qca-hostap. The error is listed below<br />----------------------<br /><em>p2@p2-Latitude-3450:~/Desktop/qsdk/qsdk$ make package/feeds/wlan_10_2/qca-wifi/download V=s<br />make[1]: Entering directory `/home/p2/Desktop/qsdk/qsdk&#039;<br />fatal: &#039;master&#039; does not appear to be a git repository<br />fatal: Could not read from remote repository.</em></p><p><em>Please make sure you have the correct access rights<br />and the repository exists.<br />cat: /home/p2/Desktop/qsdk/qsdk/qca/src/qca-wifi/os/linux/configs/config.wlan.akronite.perf: No such file or directory<br />make[2]: Entering directory `/home/p2/Desktop/qsdk/qsdk/qca/feeds/wlan_10_2/qca-wifi&#039;<br />make[2]: `download&#039; is up to date.<br />make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/p2/Desktop/qsdk/qsdk/qca/feeds/wlan_10_2/qca-wifi&#039;<br />make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/p2/Desktop/qsdk/qsdk&#039;</em><br />----------------------<br />It looks that repository address has expired or has been changed? Do you have any idea to solve this problem?</p><p>3) Third, the QSDK source on CodeAurora lacks good documentation. Could anyone refer me to some forum posts or experts&#039; blogs that explain this?</p><p>Thanks for you time:-D and I really appreciate your reply.</p><br /><br /><p>Updated 2016/11/07<br />--------------------------<br />1. The qca-wifi driver are closed-source to outsiders, unless you sign a non-disclosure agreement, usually must be OEM manufacture or vendor, with Qualcomm.</p><p>2. The different manifest are matched with different reference board, e.g., ap135. The readme file together with your reference board will tell you which version to use.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>yangqing0601</strong> on 7 Nov 2016, 07:29)</p>

Do you know what is the difference between different manifests, for example, caf_AU_LINUX_QSDK_BANANA_TARGET_ALL.0.0.913.xml and caf_AU_LINUX_QSDK_COCONUT_TARGET_ALL.3.0.879.xml. Are they target for different devices or different applications?</p>									</div>
