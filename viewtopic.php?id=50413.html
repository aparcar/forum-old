					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have setup my d-link DIR-825 to bridge mode on my lan, so it can obtain an IP address from another dhcp server while plugged into a network.&nbsp; I am able to access the device via wireless (prior to making the change).&nbsp; Now after making the change, I can get an IP address via dhcp when plugged into the wired network, but cannot access my router anymore.</p><p>This is ultimately the setup I wanted, but I forgot to turnoff broadcasting on my wireless prior to turning it into a bridge.</p><p>How can I regain access to my router to make my changes?</p><p>I have already tried powering on with the reset button held for 45 sec, but no go.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>If your router just got an random ip address from the other dhcp server. You either look into the other servers lease list or try to look with tools like wireshark for traffic from your router and get its ip address from there.</p><p>For recovery mode you need to press the button only shortly. Try to press it more the once during boot, but dont hold it.</p><p>There is also a terminal on the serial port.</p>									</div>

					<p>If the device is in bridge mode, my understanding is it basically acts as a Hub, so no IP address is assigned, correct?&nbsp; I have connected to a small lan where it was assigned an IP address and did an nmap scan, but it doesn&#039;t show.</p><p>Any other suggestions?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
