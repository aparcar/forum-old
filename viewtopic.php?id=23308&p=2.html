					<p>It looks like in addition to the heat sink I would also need to add a couple of capacitors to the 5v power circuit if I go with the regulator. If I were to go that route could I just run a 2 or 3 amp 12v supply instead of the 1 amp supply and be okay or would it just be better all around to run a second external 5v supply like you are doing? Here&#039;s an example of the 5v supply with the capacitors:</p><p><a href="http://www.epanorama.net/circuits/psu_5v.html">http://www.epanorama.net/circuits/psu_5v.html</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Bummer, no go so far. I did a mock up on a breadboard drawing 12v from the WRT and stepping it down with a 7805 circuit. The power seems to work fine but I don&#039;t think the USB circuit is working. At least it&#039;s not detecting my 1GB cruzer thumb drive. It&#039;s a 2.0 drive but supposed to be compatible with 1.1. I did install the USB kernel modules and libraries and they are loaded. I plug the thumb drive in and it lights up for a second then goes out. Nothing in dmesg. I tried swapping D+ and D- and made no difference. I did pick up a separate 12v to 5v module already built. Maybe I&#039;ll try running that instead of drawing power from the WRT in case there is not enough power. The WRT runs fine though with or without the thumb drive plugged in. Again, I&#039;m an electronics n00b so maybe my breadboard configuration is wrong. Here are some pics:</p><p><a href="http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net/i/wrt54gsv3-usb1.jpg">http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net/i/wrt54gsv3-usb1.jpg</a><br/><a href="http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net/i/wrt54gsv3-usb2.jpg">http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net/i/wrt54gsv3-usb2.jpg</a><br/><a href="http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net/i/wrt54gsv3-usb3.jpg">http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net/i/wrt54gsv3-usb3.jpg</a><br/><a href="http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net/i/wrt54gsv3-usb4.jpg">http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net/i/wrt54gsv3-usb4.jpg</a><br/><a href="http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net/i/wrt54gsv3-usb5.jpg">http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net/i/wrt54gsv3-usb5.jpg</a><br/><a href="http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net/i/wrt54gsv3-usb6.jpg">http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net/i/wrt54gsv3-usb6.jpg</a></p>									</div>

					<p>something you should try:</p><p>1.take away these 15k resistor</p><p>2.remove the original &quot;472&quot; resistor and put these 15k resistor back</p><p>3.flash your router to dd-wrt 13064+ and load only the OHCI driver (unless you are sure that currently your USB kernel modules and libraries are properly loaded)</p><p>4. do not use bread board for the usb signal lines</p><p>5.you may need to connect ground closer to bcm5352</p><p>ps. each of these is a independent suggestion</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zerx</strong> on 15 Apr 2010, 10:32)</p>

					<p>Crap, it works! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile"/> </p><p>I&#039;m not sure exactly what the problem was as it&#039;s currently working under the exact same setup as in the pictures. On the way out the door to work this morning I decided to try a few things. You did tip me off to one thing that would have caused it to never work. I didn&#039;t have the ohci kernel module installed, however after installing it and it detecting the ports it still didn&#039;t detect any device plugged into the USB ports, even after rebooting the router. So, I disconnected the 15k resisters, still nothing. Swapped the data lines, still nothing. Tried the other power source with a second power supply, still nothing. </p><p>So, I put everything back the way I started and power cycled everything. I logged in to the serial console and looked around and happened to look down and saw the thumb drive light was on steady. That was different. Looked at the dmesg output and it showed my mass storage. Installed vfat module (wasn&#039;t sure what I had on the stick and didn&#039;t want to reformat yet) and mounted the device with no problem. So now it&#039;s just put everything onto a permanent board and mount it.</p><p>Thanks for all your help on this!</p><p>Oh, this is Kamikaze 8.09.2 (2.4 kernel).</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, glad you got the bastard to play nice Void Man. Can you replicate this error with your setup when overclocking or underclocking?<br/>The device no longer likes either overclocking or underclocking when the usb is plugged. I am thinking the bus itself is sensitive, thinking back agp or pci clock tempermentality prior to locks. I am neither using a regulator or additional resistors, just an adapter 5v @~1750ma. I&#039;ve successfully run 3 devices off the unit (bcm5352) with an unpowered hub. The supply seems to be and should be more than ample wattage for 2 usb spec devices and the router, but acts funky when I change the clock frequency, something I didn&#039;t experience before. </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>hub.c: new USB device 00:03.0-2, assigned address 4

					<p>That mmc driver works with every bcm linux firmware I have tried, from openwrt, and dd-wrt, to tomato. It is from a dd-wrt build from last December. I was under the assumption (since the datasheets aren&#039;t directly available by any route I know to verify) that all bcm5352 had usb2 as well, as per the prior page and my ~success. I guess I have usb 1 and the soldering points are as in bus 1/2. I didn&#039;t notice ehci wasn&#039;t loaded... oops....</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>yopo</strong> on 16 Apr 2010, 01:41)</p>

					<p>What is the source of that mmc module? Is it already included in the kernel? Is it GPL? I&#039;m not going to run it without knowing where it comes from. Regarding your mention of your usb2 success. I see where you posted a link earlier in this thread to another thread and you mention usb2 but you don&#039;t mention what it is that makes you believe you have usb2. It would be really nice if I could get usb2 but what I have read from zerx and from what I see on my router it&#039;s only v1.1.</p>									</div>

					<p>I would not see a reason against it (unless it draws more power than the router can deliver - seems to be an issue for some routers, using an active powered hub helps in that case).</p>									</div>
