					<p>Hi everybody<br />First of all thanks everybody for all of your effort. OpenWrt so far is just what I am looking for!<br />Thanks to <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt160nl">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt160nl</a> I&#039;ve just installed a version of OpenWrt.<br />Now my Router Model Linksys WRT160NL Version 1 has installed the firmware OpenWrt Backfire 10.03.1 / LuCI 0.10.0 Release.</p><p>As far as I understood, the router supports the latest trunk version, but how can I update OpenWrt from the Backfire 10.03.1 to the latest Barrier Breaker 14.07?<br />Should I build my own image? Is there an image already created which I can use?</p><p>By the way, I am new here, please feel free to move this post to a different place if needed.</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>first of all, welcome to the community!</p><p>As far as I can see, there&#039;s a sysupgrade image available for your router model:</p><p><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-wrt160nl-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_br … pgrade.bin</a></p><p>The easiest way to do the upgrade is to flash this image using Luci&#039;s flash upgrade interface or the command line interface described here:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.sysupgrade">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.sysupgrade</a></p><p>IMPORTANT: please don&#039;t be angry with me if the upgrade doesn&#039;t succeed for some reason and your router doesn&#039;t boot afterwards, I have no experience at all with the router model you are using. Fortunately, OpenWrt never touches the bootloader&#039;s flash area so if you have a failed upgrade, you still have the option to flash a new image using the bootloader&#039;s capabilities (generally through TFTP or a serial connection). Reviving the device through TFTP seems to be quite easy to do using <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt160nl#unbricking_via_tftp">this method</a>.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>geryhun</strong> on 5 Jan 2015, 00:24)</p>

					<p>Hi there!</p><p>I have a <strong>Linksys WRT160NL (CUR01)</strong> which I would very much like to flash with OpenWrt. I&#039;ve been reading the wiki and the forum, but I&#039;m still not sure how to proceed...</p><p><strong>I basically have one single question at this point: </strong> is it now safe to flash the initial and latest (<em>openwrt-15.05-ar71xx-generic-wrt160nl-squashfs-factory.bin</em>) firmware from the stock Web GUI directly?</p><p>I did go through the wiki page <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/WRT160NL">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/WRT160NL</a> and all referred links therein, but I couldn&#039;t get a clear answer. Maybe I&#039;m missing something out - apologies if so; I&#039;m just getting started with OpenWrt...</p><p>I hope one of you can lend me a hand with this!</p><p>Many thanks in advance! ;-)</p><p><span class="bbu">Note</span>: This is the newest related discussion that I found, so I decided to post here - apologies if this is the wrong place.</p>									</div>
