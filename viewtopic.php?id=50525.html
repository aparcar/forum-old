					<p>Dear all,<br />I wish to connect to the wireless network (A) that requires a web login procedure and allows only one host per user.<br />This is of course a bummer, since I wish to connect with more than one device at a time.</p><p>my idea is to connect to the network A with OpenWRT on a wireless router and share the connection on a second wireless network B for the rest of my devices on a second wireless router (I have 2 TP-link TL-WR841N v9 around). Network B needs also to be masqueraded NAT I assume.</p><p>Does this make sense? I have the feeling I am missing something</p><p>Thanks a lot</p><p>Alessandro</p>									</div>

					<p>You wish your OpenWrt router to connect to the wireless network, request an address from DHCP, and then let clients behind OpenWrt use this as internet access, while the wireless network believes there is only one host (the OpenWrt router itself)?</p><p>Then this is where you should start: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedclient#using.masquerade">Routed client using MASQUERADE</a></p><p>This will provide the wireless network A as WAN access. Clients connected via Ethernet should get access directly. With this setup, the first host that connects to your OpenWrt router will need to authenticate the web login. Furthermore you can setup wireless network B on your OpenWrt router, either by a second SSID on a different VLAN, or in case of a dual-radio router, use one radio to connect to network A and the other to provide network B.</p>									</div>
