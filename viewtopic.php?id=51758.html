					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve just setup a WNDR3700v2 with a recent trunk snapshot: BARRIER BREAKER (Bleeding Edge, r41679) to replace my Buffalo, which is still running Backfire I think.</p><p>However, i&#039;m having a really odd problem with vlan&#039;s.</p><p>Unless, I have an untagged port, the vlan doesn&#039;t seem to appear on the tagged ports...</p><p>eg:</p><p>If I have:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config switch_vlan
        option device &#039;switch0&#039;
        option vlan 4
        option ports &#039;0t 1t 5t&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Then vlan4 doesn&#039;t work with the switch connected to port 0, or the server connected to port 1.</p><p>If I change it to this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config switch_vlan
        option device &#039;switch0&#039;
        option vlan 4
        option ports &#039;0t 1t 2 5t&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Then vlan4 works with the switch connected to port 0, and the server connected to port 1 - as well as untagged on port 2.</p><p>This is my full switch config:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config switch
    option name &#039;switch0&#039;
    option reset 1
    option enable_vlan &#039;1&#039;
    option blinkrate &#039;2&#039;

config switch_vlan
    option device &#039;switch0&#039;
    option vlan 2
    option ports &#039;0t 1t 5t&#039;

config switch_vlan
        option device &#039;switch0&#039;
        option vlan 3
        option ports &#039;0t 1t 5t&#039;

config switch_vlan
        option device &#039;switch0&#039;
        option vlan 4
        option ports &#039;0t 1t 2 5t&#039;

config switch_vlan
        option device &#039;switch0&#039;
        option vlan 5
        option ports &#039;0t 5t&#039;

config switch_vlan
        option device &#039;switch0&#039;
        option vlan 6
        option ports &#039;0t 5t&#039;

config switch_vlan
        option device &#039;switch0&#039;
        option vlan 7
        option ports &#039;0t 1t 3 5t&#039;

config switch_vlan
        option device &#039;switch0&#039;
        option vlan 8
        option ports &#039;0t 1t 3 5t&#039;

config switch_vlan
        option device &#039;switch0&#039;
        option vlan 9
        option ports &#039;0t 5t&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Interestingly, vlan 2 seems to work fine, but 4, 7 &amp; 8 show the symptom above - so i&#039;ve had to add port 3 to them both (there is nothing plugged into port 3).</p><p>(i&#039;ve not yet had chance to try vlans 3, 5 or 9)</p><p>Any ideas?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Ian</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ichilton</strong> on 22 Jul 2014, 03:09)</p>
