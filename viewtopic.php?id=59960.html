					<p>I have managed to install the openvpn-openssl package and I also found these instructions on the Hide My Ass website&nbsp; on this page - <a href="https://support.hidemyass.com/hc/en-us/articles/202723486-OpenWRT-router-OpenVPN-setup">https://support.hidemyass.com/hc/en-us/ … nVPN-setup</a> but <br />the&nbsp; &quot;OpenVPN autoinstaller for DD-WRT and OpenWRT routers.&quot; link doesnt work</p><p>So i started to follow through the manual installation instructions and they are out of date, the interface within openwrt looks very different now and the &quot;luci-app-openvpn&quot; package doesnt seem to exist anymore any idea if the same instructions apply to the openvpn-openssl package?</p><br /><p>Ive set up a VPN on my Linux box before no problem at all but this seems at a completely different difficulty level...</p>									</div>

					<p>Luci is only a web gui for editing your config.&nbsp; It&#039;s better to do it directly.&nbsp; Use WinSCP and navigate to /etc/config/openvpn and it will open in a text editor.</p><p>Go to YOUR service and get THEIR Linux scripts.&nbsp; It does not appear that anyone else on this forum has written about vpnuk.&nbsp; Maybe they have a forum you can solicit help from.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, where it says click here to download the configuration files.&nbsp; You will need to reformat the content to the OpenWRT format in the OpenVPN Config file.&nbsp; That&#039;s as good as it will get. Then look at your system logs and see what it complains about.&nbsp; Set your verb to 4 or 5 to see more messages.&nbsp; Generally this is set at 3 for general use (ie once it&#039;s working)</p><p>This post and others in the wiki will show how to addd some lines to push the OpenVPN logs to a text file, but you will need to use WinSCP to read these.&nbsp; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/openvpn-streamlined-server-setup.">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/openv … ver-setup.</a>&nbsp; This post will let you add the logs as a tab in Luci, which I found helpful in trouble shooting.&nbsp; <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=58715">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=58715</a></p>									</div>
