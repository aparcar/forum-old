					<p>Hi.I use gargoyle in my Tplinkwr841 and 741.I had issue with ddns disscussed here:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=276050#p276050">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 50#p276050</a><br />Installing coreutils-sha1sum solve my problem but it makes many problem.Most of gargoyle setting became unusable after that.I discuss the problem in gargoyle forum without any helpful solution:<br /><a href="http://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=7150">http://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/vi … amp;t=7150</a><br />I would like to ask it again here in order to find a solution for it because it seems OpenWrt users are much more and more skilful than gargoyle users.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>harsini</strong> on 26 May 2015, 09:30)</p>
