					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have an Arcadyan ARW7519RW router. It has nice stock firmware features such as USB, Wifi-N, GE Port, 2 FXS, 3g modem support, 5 port switch. I would like to know if there is support (total or partial booting would be just fine) with openwrt for such router. I know the chipset is VR9, because I can read in one of the chips that is the VRX268 model <a href="http://www.lantiq.com/uploads/tx_abzlantiqproducts/PB-e-0027-v1_lres.pdf">http://www.lantiq.com/uploads/tx_abzlan … 1_lres.pdf</a>. However, the processor is still unknown for me as it has a big black cooler on the top of it.</p><p>Can somebody give me a hint of a firmware that could work? I am ready to flash it with openWRT to check if it works.</p><p>Here, few pictures of the board.</p><p><a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/26/20120902005324.jpg/"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://img26.imageshack.us/img26/20/20120902005324.th.jpg" alt="http://img26.imageshack.us/img26/20/20120902005324.th.jpg" /></span></a> <a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/854/20120902201523.jpg/"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://img854.imageshack.us/img854/9658/20120902201523.th.jpg" alt="http://img854.imageshack.us/img854/9658/20120902201523.th.jpg" /></span></a> <a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/713/20120902201512.jpg/"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://img713.imageshack.us/img713/1667/20120902201512.th.jpg" alt="http://img713.imageshack.us/img713/1667/20120902201512.th.jpg" /></span></a> <a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/339/20120902201430.jpg/"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://img339.imageshack.us/img339/7972/20120902201430.th.jpg" alt="http://img339.imageshack.us/img339/7972/20120902201430.th.jpg" /></span></a> <a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/502/20120902201425.jpg/"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://img502.imageshack.us/img502/5646/20120902201425.th.jpg" alt="http://img502.imageshack.us/img502/5646/20120902201425.th.jpg" /></span></a> <a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/39/20120902201417.jpg/"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/2049/20120902201417.th.jpg" alt="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/2049/20120902201417.th.jpg" /></span></a> <a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/716/20120902201357.jpg/"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://img716.imageshack.us/img716/7903/20120902201357.th.jpg" alt="http://img716.imageshack.us/img716/7903/20120902201357.th.jpg" /></span></a></p><p>Thank you in advance <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>I imagine that the serial port is at the row of solder pads below the cpu. Try to interface with the bootloader to make it boot an image via tftp. I think OpenWrt already supports some other router with VR9, so that would be an obvious starting point.</p>									</div>

I would like to know the possibilities of this device. Does it have MAC-based VLAN support? (Interactive TV Motorola boxes). Extracting/decrypting the configuration would be nice (for VOIP details).<br />Opening up the device was a bit difficult, but I think it needs to be done only once? I would like a password-patched bootloader to flash. I have soldered in a JTAG header. I doubt they want this device back since it&#039;s from 2011 already. The stickers have yellowed already. Is there a JTAG programmer software for this that also does USB cables?<br />I have have serial output at least, showing v3.00.06c loader version and 16 asterisks for password...<br />I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll use this device though, some say it&#039;s not so good and if OpenWrt doesn&#039;t do DSL, it&#039;s not as useful. In that case I&#039;ll be using a different router with the required VLAN settings.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>darkfader</strong> on 9 Jul 2013, 17:45)</p>

I would like to know the possibilities of this device. Does it have MAC-based VLAN support? (Interactive TV Motorola boxes). Extracting/decrypting the configuration would be nice (for VOIP details).<br />Opening up the device was a bit difficult, but I think it needs to be done only once? I would like a password-patched bootloader to flash. I have soldered in a JTAG header. I doubt they want this device back since it&#039;s from 2011 already. The stickers have yellowed already. Is there a JTAG programmer software for this that also does USB cables?<br />I have have serial output at least, showing v3.00.06c loader version and 16 asterisks for password...<br />I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll use this device though, some say it&#039;s not so good and if OpenWrt doesn&#039;t do DSL, it&#039;s not as useful. In that case I&#039;ll be using a different router with the required VLAN settings.</p></blockquote></div><p>Hello any luck with the decrypting configuration file? I would like to change some country related setting which is normally not accessible. Would that be possible via JTAG too? Could you post link for JTAG HW and SW you used? Thank you.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>t23145</strong> on 21 May 2015, 16:38)</p>
