					<p>I have made a package for the IBM WebSphere MQTT client code. Go to <a href="http://mqtt.org">http://mqtt.org</a>/ and click on &quot;C reference implementation (ia93)&quot; for more info on this package. It includes a client library (libwmqtt) and a couple of sample applications, &quot;publish&quot; and &quot;subscribe&quot;.</p><p>The SDK Makefile and patches needed to build this package can be found at <a href="http://pobox.com/~b.candler/software/openwrt/openwrt-libwmqtt.tgz">http://pobox.com/~b.candler/software/op â€¦ bwmqtt.tgz</a></p><p>Unfortunately, the IBM licence doesn&#039;t seem to allow distribution of either the source or the binaries. So whilst I&#039;m happy for this to make it into the buildroot, there would need to be a mechanism by which the package can be marked as &#039;non-redistributable&#039; so no binary image is made, and no source tarball released.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Brian.</p>									</div>
