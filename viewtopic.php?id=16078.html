					<p>It has been quite a while since OpenWrt had a new Kamikaze release. The <br />developer team has decided that it is time to get things straight and <br />focus on a new release. This release have the official name: OpenWrt <br />Kamikaze 808 Release.</p><p>The schedule will look like this:</p><p>*Last day in July - final release candidate: 808 RC-1<br />808 RC-1 will be a feature freeze, and all changes after this point will <br />be bug fixes.</p><p>*Last day in August - final release: OpenWrt Kamikaze 808 Release.</p><p>OpenWrt Kamikaze 808 Release will focus on bringing the following:</p><p>- Firewall rewrite<br />- Broadcom 47xx running reliably with the new Kernel, not including wifi<br />- IMQ and Traffic shaping tested with newer kernels, especially 2.6.25<br />- Sysupgrade for more platforms (x86 is tested again)<br />- The new web interface (LuCI, Lua Configuration Interface)<br />- Attention towards the integration of security updates<br />- Package maintaining and updates between releases <br />- Testing, testing and lots of testing...</p><p>The 808 Release will also include support for several new platforms/targets.</p><p>Added to this there will be a need to discuss, and find solutions towards, <br />how best to solve the &#039;patch submission process&#039;, work on updating the existing <br />Kamikaze documentation - and finally anyone should feel free to comment and <br />suggest.</p><p>It is the hope of the OpenWrt developer-group that all users and members <br />in one way or other will take part in the practical work which will lead <br />to the OpenWrt Kamikaze Release 808.</p><p>WIP-Day in June, July and August will focus on the upcoming 808 Release, <br />so join #openwrt-devel at UTC 12:00 on the last saturday in the <br />following months.</p><p>Sincerely<br />and on behalf of the</p><p>The OpenWrt Team</p>									</div>

					<p>Nice, I can&#039;t wait for the new release but I was hoping by now we would have a stable Kamikaze version with broadcom wifi suport. I am not complaining just a thought. Great job to all the developers and everyone who helped put this together.</p><br /><p>ScarEye</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ScarEye</strong> on 20 Jun 2008, 16:12)</p>

					<p>In regards to &quot;LuCI&quot;:</p><p>a) Is this a split-off of webif/x-wrt? Or simply a base framework change to use Lua and they/it will be integrated with it?<br />b) If yes to a, will webif/x-wrt continue in it&#039;s current form and simply be built on the new layout system as an &quot;upgraded&quot; web interface?<br />c) Is this planned as a sort of template system whereby advanced users could seemingly learn how to make a lua script page that easily integrates into the whole?</p><p>I guess what I&#039;m really getting at is I&#039;m hoping the x-wrt/webif project will become more integrated, as I do know they&#039;re gearing for some of these changes but I&#039;m unsure as to the level of developer integration between the two projects and was always a bit confused as to why the two were kept as separate projects to start with, other than the obvious reason of trying to keep the &quot;new&quot; end-user that&#039;s completely unfamiliar with how to do anything outside a GUI from driving others a bit insane in the main project sections.</p>									</div>

					<p>Not sure if this the best forum for discussion but I would like to see if anything can be done about fixing (adding a patch) Ticket #2409.</p><p>Basically it patches /etc/preinit to test for a /etc/preinit.usb which can test for the existance of a loadable usb rootfs.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ll just quickly comment, from the personal point of view, on both the LuCI question and the reference to the specific ticket.</p><p>LuCI - This is intended as the new framework for the default OpenWrt Kamikaze webif. It is the intention to bring X-Wrt and LuCI together and thereby create an integrated and flexible environment. There is an overlap between X-Wrt developers and the OpenWrt core team, and there has from the beginning on been a common basis. The aspect of &quot;keeping separate&quot; - this separation has create a visibility of X-Wrt, likewise as making room for the development itself.</p><p>Tickets/patches - As it was explained, the next month will focus on working through the existing tickets and patches towards a freeze at the end of July. The will be a bit of balancing, but hopefully all the tickets will be fixed and patches committed :-)</p>									</div>

The only remaining issue is wireless support and at the moment acx-mac80211 is looking very ropey. The original acx driver kind of works, but only supports WEP and is plagued by TX timeout errors. Whether all this is resolved before 8.08 is released, remains to be seen.... but given the rate of acx-mac80211 development so far, I personally think it&#039;s very unlikely.</p>									</div>
