					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a TP-LINK TL-MR3420 board. I have a USB drive attached through a USB hub. I experience very low transfer speeds (approx. 75 KB/s). The USB hub has already been replaced; also an other USB drive has been tried too. (I also have a WNDR3700, which is ar71xx too, but have not experienced any usb problems with that one.)<br />Where can I look for further problems?</p><p>Thanks a lot!</p>									</div>
