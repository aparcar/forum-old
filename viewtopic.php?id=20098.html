					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I&#039;m using OpenWrt on a fonera plus and I usually flash on it the latest snapshot fron the SVN.<br />Every now and then i do a svn up, then compile it and flash it.</p><p>I&#039;ve alwyas had a problem: because of a <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/3507">bug</a> to connect to the ethernet port I had to change my MAC address. Altough this was a work around it was working, but from <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/15185">r15185</a> it is not working anymore; so after i flash the new compiled firmware my fonera+ is useless being the WAN disabled by default.</p><p>I would like to know if there is any solution to this problem.<br />Right now I&#039;m using the standard release from the download section and changing my MAC everything is working.<br />Latest snapshot of DD-Wrt is working fine (while SP1 is not), but I don&#039;t know what is the difference.</p><p>Any help would be appreciated. It would also be nice to have an option to compile Kamikaze with WAN enabled.</p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>
