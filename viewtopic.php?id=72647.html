					<p>Hi, I am trying to make my Raspberry Pi2 Wireless Router. Main motivation is my Buffalo routers are getting old.</p><p>I have tried with rtl8192cu but not work with Master Mode(It works fine as client mode). It said &#039;Wireless is disabled or not associated&#039;.</p><p>Is there any chips/usb devices which can act as Master mode so I can make my RP2 as router?</p><p>Please throw your thoughts any small idea may be a solution.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Do yourself a favour and look for better suited hardware (depending on your price range ipq806x, mvebu, mt7621, lantiq, ar71xx, ...) instead, AP mode and USB are always a problem - but RPi and wired+wireless network over USB 2.0 remains an even bigger one.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi slh,</p><p>Thanks for your reply. I (accidentally) found wireless.wiki.kernel.org and they said rtl8192cu is master-able.</p><p>And hours of trying and finally works as AP! </p><p>What I did was:</p><p>- Add one more module. This one was not installed automatically when I added rtl8192cu module.<br />kmod-net-rtl8192su</p><p>So installed modules are:<br />kmod-net-rtl8192su<br />kmod-rtl8192c-common<br />kmod-rtl8192cu</p><p>- Set specific channel (= anything but auto)<br />Auto channeling is not working with rtl8192cu, specifically mine.</p><p>That&#039;s it! I am enjoying Pi2 + rtl8192cu as a new Wifi router, much powerful/flexible router than WZR600DHP.</p>									</div>
