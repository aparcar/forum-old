I love Gargoyle! For me it&#039;s the best to use as the GUI works excellent with my screen reader. I use it on all my older routers, but am held back by it being only built on stable OpenWRT. I have both the wrt3200ACM and the WRT1900AC v2 There is builds of gargoyle for them but baste on cc with kernel 3.18</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tapper</strong> on 10 Feb 2017, 11:55)</p>

					<p>InkblotAdmirer,</p><p>so you are able to flash back to OEM firmware using the gui on the acm? From Davids description I take it LEDE prevents the installation of third party firmware by regular means unlike Linksys or OpenWrt.</p><p>---</p><p>tapper,</p><p>As for Gargoyle I had to set an initial password via serial console, after that it looked like I could be mostly working, can&#039;t say for sure as I never looked at it before. From the short stroll Gargoyles design principles make a lot more sense to me than Lucis (which reminds me of HAL). The lack for ipv6 support is quite a let down though.</p><p>Just because I built Gargoyle on top of swrt doesn&#039;t mean it has any additional features. On the contrary some of the existing ones might be broken. What are the issues you have and hope to magically be solved by replacing the base system? Maybe they aren&#039;t hard to fix at all.
