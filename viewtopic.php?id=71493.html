					<p>Hi all</p><p>I am trying to install openwrt in the linksys 1200ac router. It has two dual partition. When I flash it from one partition it boot from other partition. so I used<br />Firmware Recovery:</p><p>Manually switch the router from primary to alternate partition or vice versa [backup] partition:</p><p>Power off router with power switch.<br />Turn power back on and Power LED will light.<br />As soon as all LEDs turn off (~2s), power off router with power switch<br />Turn power back on and Power LED will light.<br />As soon as all LEDs turn off (~2s), power off router with power switch<br />Turn power back on and Power LED will light.<br />As soon as all LEDs turn off (~2s), power off router with power switch<br />Turn power back on and allow router to fully boot.<br />It should now be booted to the alternate firmware partition (partitions)</p><p>So I used this way to switch the boot from previously flashed partition. It successfully switch boot but Openwrt does not install. Does anyone have any process or tips? Or am I doing any wrong thing?</p>									</div>

					<p>The standard procedure for these devices is to boot from one partition (either stock firmware or OpenWrt), install OpenWrt on the other partition, and reboot into the other partition. Installation process already takes care to install into other partition and then boot into it.</p><p>What I could not understand is what problem are you experiencing exactly.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks</p><p>I have two partition. Partition number 1 and 2. I boot from partition number 1 and in the partition number 1 I have the openwrt binary file ,here I use &quot;System upgrade -F filename &quot; to install openwrt. After using this command router automatically reboot and switch to partition number 2. So I powered off the router when its power LED light getting turn off before booting to partition number 2. Then I do&nbsp; three times for switching the boot to partition number 1. Then allow the router for fully booting. Is there any problem? Open wrt does not install to partition 1. </p><p>If I install open wrt in partition 1 and it takes care to install partition number 2 . Then why do you need router powering to switch the boot because its automatically switch to partition number 2.</p>									</div>

					<p>When you boot from partition 1, sysupgrade should install on partition 2, and then will boot into partition 2. Is that working for you? Are you expecting other behaviour?</p><p>If you force the router to boot from partition 1 again, you will be back as if you did not executed sysupgrade. Why are you doing that?

					<p>You were installing a build for another device... thanks to the dual partition you did not brick your device...<br />You will find a link to the correct file on the device page: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt_ac_series">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt_ac_series</a><br />Since you are installing from another OpenWrt / LEDE, use the &quot;sysupgrade&quot; variant (not the &quot;factory&quot; variant).</p>									</div>

					<p>Perhaps LEDE is not prepared to downgrade back to OpenWrt, and is failing to recognize an older version for the image file, I am not sure...
