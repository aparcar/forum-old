					<p>Maybe the question should better be &quot;which is the maximum read/write cycles of NOR/NAND flash memory, and how is this translated into lifetime expectancy of a router running OpenWrt?&quot;</p><p>Does anyone know?<br />I&#039;m really curious to hear some opinions!</p><p>Thanks. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>angelos</strong> on 7 Oct 2014, 20:12)</p>

					<p>No idea, but I have flashed my WNDR3700, WNDR3700v2 &amp; WNDR3800 routers together over 700 times during the past 4 years (while testing my community build). No problems so far.</p><p>Most of the volatile/temporary files get written only to the RAM, so flash does not get that much stress in normal operations.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 7 Oct 2014, 20:25)</p>

					<p>Thank you for your answers.<br />They just triggered another question I have...</p><p>How do we &quot;count&quot; writes?</p><p>I mean... if for example we change the contents of a file and then save it (in LuCI or in command line), how many &quot;writes&quot; have been made in flash? Can we count them somehow? Does counting depend on how many bytes/kilobytes the file is?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>angelos</strong> on 7 Oct 2014, 20:40)</p>
