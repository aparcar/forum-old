					<p>Hi,</p><p>I’m new to OpenWRT and installed it (Backfire 10.03.1) on my TP-Link 1043ND yesterday successfully.<br />I installed and removed some packages via opkg (kmod-ubs-ohci, cups, …) but eventually got an error message that not enough space is left in /overlay when I tried to install sane-backends.</p><p>Then I noticed that there is a difference between the output of “df -h“ which reports 68.0K free of 4.7M on /overlay and “du -sh /overlay” which gave me around 9.0M. Then I read a bit and as far as I understand the difference is because of the LZMA compression of the JFFS2 filesystem. Is this correct?<br />I tried to free some space by removing packages I installed with opkg, but this failed with errors like </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# opkg remove sane-backends
No packages removed.
Collected errors:
 * pkg_parse_from_stream_nomalloc: Missing new line character at end of file!
 * parse_conffiles: Failed to parse Conffiles line for dnsmasq</code></pre></div><p>So I went to look for the big files myself and removed most of the files in /usr/lib/sane via “rm”. Now “du -sh /overlay&quot; gives me 2.5M, but the “df -h“ output is still the same. </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# du -sh /overlay/

Any pointers to docs or hints what to do would be really helpful since I’d like to not reflash the router.

Yes: the difference between the reported sizes is due to compression.</p><p>If this works for you, ok - but nevertheless reflashing would be the better option, tinkering with the installation is not recommended if you are still setting it up, better get it right before you use it, depend on it and regret it later...</p><p>Take the imagebuilder and create an own image which includes the packages you want, and remove others which you dont need. Even if you dont remove anything, you will still end up with more space available in your overlay filesystem because of the better compression in the rom.<br />Take a look here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtain.firmware.generate">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtai … e.generate</a></p><p>I would also recommend using a recent trunk release, unfortunately backfire 10.03.1 still has a lot of wlan stability issues on atheros devices, you will find lots of reports concerning this in the forum.</p>									</div>
