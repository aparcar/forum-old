					<p>Are you trying to build wifi repeater from your openwrt or you&#039;re going to have your own AP that NAT internet provided by another AP ?<br />In last case create one wifi network as AP client and bind it to WAN interface. Another one create as AP and bind to LAN interface.<br />One physical radio cannot work simultaneously on two frequences - thats why they will have to share one channel.<br />Or if you have two radios then you can separate client and AP and configure them independently.<br />If you want repeater without NAT then you&#039;ll probably need relayd.<br />In any case openwrt from the box cannot enter data to hotspot webpage for you. If you want this you&#039;ll have to create your own robot script to do that. Analyze web page, see how form is submitted, then write script to call wget or curl.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bolvan</strong> on 22 Jan 2016, 16:15)</p>

Since only the OpenWrt device is is connected to the WiFi hotspot, WiFi de-authentication will not occur when a PC connected to the OpenWrt device shuts down or disconnects.</p><p>Are you saying that the German public WiFi hotspots will de authenticate your PC if your browse to a blacklisted site?

Typically, all web addresses are initially resolved to the portal log in page. Once you log in, normal DNS resolution occurs and there is no log out page.</p></blockquote></div><p>Absolutely right, the Captive Portal will intercept URLs addressed by the user to re-direct them to the login page. But often users don&#039;t even start a browser after connecting to the hotspot&#039;s wifi card. They instead start a mailer program or another app on their smart phone/table/laptop and wonder why they &quot;don&#039;t get Internet access&quot;.</p><p>They even tend to ignore the notification e.g. of Android due to the NLA requests send out by the device after associating with the router&#039;s wifi card. In latest OS/X the NLA will even prominently show the login page in a big web view window on the screen (implemented in Preferences AFAIK) if such a re-direct appears after connection to the wifi card of the router. There is no doubt, that the NLA scheme has been introduced b/c of high-volume support calls at vendors why &quot;their device won&#039;t work with public hotspots&quot; :-)</p><p>In the past, hotel managers asked for a flyer with step-by-step instruction on how to log in. The URL of the login page on the central auth server in wifidog is something like <em>login.authserver.domain</em>. This page stays open in a separate tab, not only to allow manual logout, but also to show URLs for the hotel&#039;s own website, the city&#039;s website, the link to the user&#039;s profile, the status of other routers of this hotspot etc. It is not just a cheap login form in wifidog, it&#039;s more a fully featured portal page.</p><p>Since in Germany we have very stupid laws allowing even lawyers (no judge needed!) to punish hotspot owners or users, which let others download copyrighted material from the web, people here insist of being able to explicitely log out from a public hotspot. I wish, those stupid laws would be dropped, but just yesterday the high court of Germany has refused to declare the new law for prophylactical data storage by ISPs as un-constitutional, therefore allowing lawyer firms to continue spying on IPs, which is an important issue for owners of public hotspots. Each copyright infringment can cost them as much as 700 to 1.500 USD for every single download done by some unauthorized user either because he didn&#039;t need to log-in or because he abused some other&#039;s account.</p><p>Therefore it is very risky for hotspot owners to set up a repeater which does not enforce a login-/logout-scheme. But it&#039;s only a specific usage case, which does not apply to using a repeater for only yourself to avoid having log in with every devices you use, so I completely agree with you in that a STA+AP bridge might be sufficient for most people - but not for all and that was it, what I wanted to point out, especially b/c OpenWRT offers a solution even for this usage case, where devices need to be uniquely identifyable by the hotspot.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>R1D2</strong> on 28 Jan 2016, 14:54)</p>
