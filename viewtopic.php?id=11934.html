					<p>FYI: I have not obtained any hardware, yet, so &quot;just try it&quot; isn&#039;t a go for me.&nbsp; In case the choice of hardware might influence this, I want to get this resolved early, before I buy anything.</p><p>My requirement was originally to have 2 routers communicating to each other (actually 4, but each to each other).&nbsp; But this has changed slightly.&nbsp; Now there is 1 router (maybe 2) that will not be running OpenWRT, and does no support WDS.&nbsp; It will only communicate with a client (not an access point, presumably).&nbsp; Is possible to make OpenWRT talk to the specific router AS a client, without disabling the ability to talk to other wireless devices as an access point and/or via WDS?&nbsp; Note that if there are 2 such &quot;foreign&quot; routers, they will not be talking to each other (I hope).</p><p>FYI: If doing this requires some tweaks at source level and recompile everything, I already have plans to do that, anyway.</p><p>Has anyone done this before?</p>									</div>
