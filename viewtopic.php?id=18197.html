					<p>I was having a problem getting nodogsplash started with Kamikaze r13193.&nbsp; <br />Note, I don&#039;t really know what I am doing, but that has never stopped me :-)</p><p>Two problems in /etc/init.d/nodogsplash.init, one after the other:</p><p>1)&nbsp; The first was this test in start():</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if $0 test_module &amp;&amp; $WD_DIR/nodogsplash $OPTIONS; then </p><p>This resulted in the error:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; alix : Starting nodogsplash ...&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; alix : /etc/rc.common: .: line 74: test_module: not found <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; alix : FAILED:&nbsp; nodogsplash exited with non 0 status </p><p>I fixed that with:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if test_module &amp;&amp; $WD_DIR/nodogsplash $OPTIONS; then </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />This allowed me to reach the next error.&nbsp; nodogsplash start failed randomly, about 4 out of 5 times, with log errors like:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (fw_iptables.c:86) Nonzero exit status 100 from command: iptables -t mangle -A ndsOUT -s 192.168.58.249 \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -m mac --mac-source 00:09:6B:86:02:24 -j MARK --set-mark 0x100</p><p>(and no, I don&#039;t know what status 100 means - it seems to come from an enum in the iptables <br />source code,&nbsp; which seems an odd way to reproduceably number errors to inexperienced me - <br />I expect other people will see different error status numbers).</p><p>The errors in my log file were different every time, and iptables -L did not show any of the chains set <br />up.&nbsp; When it worked, I saw four &quot;ndsXXX&quot; chains.</p><p>Flailing randomly, I added these lines before the if statement in /etc/nodogsplash/nodogsplash.conf:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ### added KHL<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; iptables -t nat&nbsp; &nbsp; -N ndsOUT&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; iptables -t filter -N ndsRTR&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; iptables -t filter -N ndsNET&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; iptables -t filter -N ndsAUT&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; iptables -t mangle -N ndsTRU&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ###----&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if test_module &amp;&amp; $WD_DIR/nodogsplash $OPTIONS; then&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>That seems to start it up every time.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing that iptables needs more time to set up those chains<br />than iptables_do_command() in fw_iptables.c in nodogsplash is allowing.&nbsp; But then, when I fool around<br />with software I guess a lot.</p><p>Any ideas of what I should /really/ be doing?&nbsp; Is there some way that a clue-challenged semi-newbie<br />should be reporting this to the folks that care?</p><p>Keith</p>									</div>
