					<p>Last night, I updated my local OpenWRT git trunk to the commit ee2edac3056bdd8ba185377c56b88c905b7c87e2 as well as the OpenWRT package feeds from GitHUB to the commit fab13041b3a970a302e843fdc11cb6420b6ea9bc. After that, I rebuilt my OpenWRT from scratch (after a <em>make dirclean</em>) and notice any packages written in C++ will give an error message of <strong>ambiguous overload for &#039;operator&lt;&lt;&#039;</strong>. For instance, the squid package gives the following error message. I don&#039;t know what causes this but it compiled OK before I did the updates. My build is for <em>PLXTECH/Oxford NAS782x/OX82x</em> target system using <em>GCC 4.8.x Linaro enhancement</em> with <em>Preferred standard C++ library (libstdc++)</em>. I certainly will appreciate if anyone here will help.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>libtool: compile:  arm-openwrt-linux-uclibcgnueabi-g++ -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I../.. -I../../include -I../../lib -I../../src -I../../include -I/opt/openwrt-git-trunk/staging_dir/target-arm_mpcore_uClibc-1.0.9_eabi/usr/include -I/opt/openwrt-git-trunk/staging_dir/target-arm_mpcore_uClibc-1.0.9_eabi/usr/include -I/opt/openwrt-git-trunk/staging_dir/target-arm_mpcore_uClibc-1.0.9_eabi/include -I/opt/openwrt-git-trunk/staging_dir/toolchain-arm_mpcore_gcc-4.8-linaro_uClibc-1.0.9_eabi/usr/include -I/opt/openwrt-git-trunk/staging_dir/toolchain-arm_mpcore_gcc-4.8-linaro_uClibc-1.0.9_eabi/include -Wall -Wpointer-arith -Wwrite-strings -Wcomments -Wshadow -Werror -pipe -D_REENTRANT -I/opt/openwrt-git-trunk/staging_dir/target-arm_mpcore_uClibc-1.0.9_eabi/usr/include -O2 -pipe -march=armv6k -mtune=mpcore -fno-caller-saves -fhonour-copts -Wno-error=unused-but-set-variable -Wno-error=unused-result -mfloat-abi=soft -Wformat -Werror=format-security -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=1 -Wl,-z,now -Wl,-z,relro -std=c++11 -MT PortCfg.lo -MD -MP -MF .deps/PortCfg.Tpo -c PortCfg.cc  -fPIC -DPIC -o .libs/PortCfg.o
