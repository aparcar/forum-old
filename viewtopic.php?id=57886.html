					<p>Hi all</p><p>I am a long-time OpenWRT user and would like to bring up the subject of security of this distribution. It seems somewhat neglected.</p><p>First off, I don&#039;t mean to be offensive. I use and like OpenWRT, but security seems to be an area that isn&#039;t given much attention. I wonder about this subject and would like comments from others.</p><p>So, here are some questions and comments I have on this subject...</p><p>Does OpenWRT not have enough manpower to do security announcements/updates?</p><p>There is a security-announce mailing list here, but it is never been used:<br /><a href="https://lists.openwrt.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openwrt-security-announce">https://lists.openwrt.org/cgi-bin/mailm â€¦ y-announce</a></p><p>It seems like there are no security announcements for OpenWRT. I don&#039;t think there is any mechanism for users to know when a stable-distro package gets updated for security reasons. Is that true?</p><p>How often are packages in the stable releases updated for security reasons?</p><p>Personally, I stopped using the stable releases of OpenWRT some years ago because there was a period of years with no stable releases and some of my hardware platforms were unsupported in stable. As a result, I started building my own from sources and I still do that today, dealing with all the occasional bugs and brokenness which that brings.</p><p>I use StrongSWAN in some of my deployments, and there was a security advisory for racoon and similar IPSec/VPN packages recently. I am going to have to update my builds here soon for that. I got a security advisory for every other distro I use, but I&#039;ve never seen any kind of security notification from OpenWRT. That got me thinking.</p><p>If there are any security professionals out there, do you have any comments on OpenWRT in general?</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenWrt seems to me to be very on top of security issues in packages, as updates are quickly committed to source. Git repos have RSS feeds, you could subscribe to those (or use some RSS-to-email gateway). It doesn&#039;t differ between security and other fixes, but the stable branches aren&#039;t noisy in that regard.</p>									</div>

					<p>There&#039;s no security team that I&#039;m aware of, and a large portion of the packages are unmaintained (or almost). There is definitely a lack of manpower, a quick look at the state of this site is enough to conclude that <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>If you are building yourself then it shouldn&#039;t be much of a problem keeping an eye on important security advisories for the services you run though. The base OpenWrt system is secure enough.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>arokh</strong> on 10 Jun 2015, 10:32)</p>

					<p>I&#039;ve heard that the packages do get backported to stable branch when security updates are available, but I&#039;m not sure how often this happens. I&#039;m also happy to see that the new CC-rc1 branch has added a package verification feature. There also seems to be some work on hardened builds, but I couldn&#039;t find any info about it.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>* Improved Security Features<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Rewritten package signing architecture based on ed25519<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Added support for jails<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Added support for hardened builds</p></blockquote></div>									</div>

					<p>I appreciate the comments thus far. Thanks to everyone for your feedback.</p><p>I sort of figured this is how it was, but it&#039;s good to have it confirmed.</p><p>I will definitely check out those RSS feeds. There are a few key packages that I need to watch.</p>									</div>
