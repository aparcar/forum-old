Of course I have no record of what the password was.</p></blockquote></div><p>It is very easy to use the Netgear&#039;s TFTP recovery mode to flash a new<strong> factory image</strong> to WNDR3800 and 3700v1 and 3700v2. I have used that a dozen of times during the last 6 years. I usually uses TFTP2 GUI client.</p><p>Wiki instructions for the Netgear recovery mode are quite accurate:<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3700#recovery_flash_in_failsafe_mode">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wn … lsafe_mode</a></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Note that this TFTP recovery mode is separate from Openwrt&#039;s own &quot;failsafe mode&quot; and is offered by the original u-boot boot manager by Netgear, so it should be enabled with either an original Netgear firmware, a working Openwrt firmware or a bricked Openwrt firmware.</p><p>Note: WNDR3700 may also automatically enter the TFTP recovery mode, if you have flashed a bad firmware image. That is indicated by the power led blinking slowly and steadily, much slower that during a normal Openwrt boot.</p><p>For TFTP recovery you need:</p><p>*&nbsp; &nbsp; A TFTP client for your computer. There are both command-line tools and GUI versions available.<br />*&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Your computer must have an IP address from the 192.168.1.x network, as the router failsafe mode defaults to 192.168.1.1. You might need to manually config the address,</strong> as some operating systems change the IP to a link-local 196.254.x.x address after a while if there is no DHCP server.<br />*&nbsp; &nbsp; A new firmware to flash in. Either an original Netgear firmware or an Openwrt &quot;factory.img&quot; firmware. &quot;Sysupgrade&quot; version will not work.<br />*&nbsp; &nbsp; Access to router&#039;s reset button</p><p>Steps needed in the flashing process:</p><p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; configure and connect PC<br />2&nbsp; &nbsp; power on the router<br />3&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>press and hold the RESET button as soon as the switch LEDs light up.</strong><br />4&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>keep holding RESET until the power LED begins to flash orange and then green.</strong><br />5&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>once the power LED is flashing green, release RESET</strong><br />6&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>start the TFTP transfer to router at 192.168.1.1.</strong><br />7&nbsp; &nbsp; wait a few minutes for the router to complete flash. It should reboot automatically.</p><p>Please note that the TFTP transfer is quick, as the file is stored in RAM. However, the flashing process itself will take several minutes, after which the router should reboot automatically.</p></blockquote></div><p>EDIT:<br />And Arokh&#039;s build may also have a working reset button. Probably resets the router, if you press it over 5 seconds.<br />(I have removed the time limit from my own build, but 5 seconds is the default). Reset would delete all settings (incl. password) and just leave the defaults provided by Arokh.</p><p>EDIT2:<br />The recovery process is found also at Netgear site nowadays:<br /><a href="http://kb.netgear.com/22688/How-to-upload-firmware-to-a-NETGEAR-router-using-TFTP">http://kb.netgear.com/22688/How-to-uplo … using-TFTP</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 17 Feb 2017, 16:23)</p>

					<p>hnyman,</p><p>Firstly, thank you very much for your very quick reply.</p><p>I had read and tried all available documentation already.&nbsp; I am from the old school that reads the manual first. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I did manage to resolve the issue and in so doing I noticed the following.</p><p>There are at least three ways to set the router in fail-safe mode. The behavior is different based on what method is used.&nbsp; I did assume that fail-safe was fail-safe and only tried one method (wait till the power light flash green and then you have two seconds to hot the reset button and that gets you in fail-safe). That method did not work and gave me the issues mentioned in my earlier post. The same happened with hitting and keeping reset pushed in from prior to the power on till it got in fail-safe. That gave me the same problems.&nbsp; The way out, in my circumstances whatever they were, I don&#039;t know exactly what state the router firmware was in, was to hit the reset as soon as the power light first came on after powering on and that finally gave me success with no more timeouts when using tftp.</p><p>I hope this note is useful to someone.</p><p>Thanks again hnyman as it is your reply that urged me on trying these alternatives.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey Hnyman, <br />After using the LEDE build, I&#039;ve noticed that something is not quite working right with the firewall regarding nathelper when port forwarding for FTP.</p><p>If I open port 21 (FTP), clients cannot connect in PASV mode. If I set a specific port range for PASV mode and forward those on the firewall to my server, they can connect no problems.,<br />Previously, under I think your old build of using OpenWRT months back, I didn&#039;t need to have to do that. I could just open Port 21 and it&#039;d work.</p><p>I assume this has something to do with nathelper, or potentially lack thereof? <br />I did add in the package for nathelper and -extras, but honestly, I have no idea if thats all I need to do to enable it.</p><p>Any ideas? Do you have this same issue?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>aaronta</strong> on 9 Mar 2017, 07:02)</p>

					<p>Hi,<br />Maybe this&#039;s the first message I&#039;ve left on the form. It&#039;s 63 pages so I decide to find help by asking you directly. I want to know whether your firmware support IPv6 Passthrough mode(just like original factory firmware), because I&#039;ve tried the odhcpd or 6relayd but they actually didn&#039;t work even though I&#039;ve got a real IPv6 address(I&#039;ve tried every possible commands by using WinSCP).
