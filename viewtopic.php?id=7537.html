					<p>Cool, glad you got it booting. The TRX vs. BIN is an easy mistake, as DD-WRT&#039;s firmware images are not named in the same manner (it&#039;s generic is named .bin).</p><p>There is a lot of interest in OpenWrt for micro devices. I would like to work on this, but already have too many projects in this community I&#039;m working on. I would like to see there be a concerted effort to develop a good micro OpenWrt firmware (please, we need not hear from those who don&#039;t like the idea ;p).</p>									</div>
