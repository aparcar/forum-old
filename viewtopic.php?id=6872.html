					<p>There is a project for accessing the internet through TI calculators; I almost got it, but it requires a graylink (old serial ones). The requires a computer, though, and might not support SSH. If you have A LOT of time, are an oscilliscope, go ahead and try to build an IO-ethernet thing. That would be awesome.</p><p>poly-p man</p>									</div>

					<p>I used an old Handspring visor and re-purposed one of the ethernet ports to a serial port.

It sounds like a fun project.<br />Well, it shouldn&#039;t take that much time. You need some experience with electronics and assembler programming, but a serial console for the TI-83 wouldn&#039;t be too hard. Personally, I don&#039;t see the point, but I&#039;m sure someone would find it useful.</p><p>Regarding SSH (which someone seemed to suggest), you can forget it. The TI-83p has a Z80 - not exactly an encryption workhorse of a CPU.</p><p>Cheers,<br />David</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not thinking about making it use SSH. I just want it to connect to a serial console (RS232 or some other serial bus implemented with some GPIO pins). For my application, security is not much of a concern. It would be even neater if I could plug it in using a USB adapter (integrated into my calculator), although I&#039;m not sure if the USB chipset can do that. (The one in the TI-83 series is pretty limited, but the one in the TI-84 and newer 89 series is much more flexible.)</p>									</div>
