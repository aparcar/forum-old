					<p>Hey Guys,</p><p>i installed Open WRT on my WZR HP AG300H (Buffalo Airstation) and i have no clue what i did. The original Firmware sucked in some cases, so i read about open WRT. i installed it over the &quot;firmware flash&quot; function of the router.<br />Now, i can&#039;t use it anymore. I installed openwrt-ar71xx-generic-wzr-hp-ag300h-squashfs-factory.bin and i didn&#039;t know, that it has no Luci.<br />I can access the router with my windows 7 pc by using putty. On this way, is already set a password for the root user. That&#039;s where my know-how ends. the router is NOT connected to the internet and i have no idea how to configure it, use the vi editor and so on. i tried a bit, but it did not work.</p><p>I&#039;d like to get luci on the router and configure it. i need a step by step tutorial, because i&#039;m a super-noob, sorry <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> maybe you guys can help me, i&#039;d be very thankfull!!!! And by the way, sorry for the bad english, i&#039;m from germany</p>									</div>

					<p>You can still install LuCI by running the following line via PuTTY (just copy-paste it):<br />opkg update &amp;&amp; opkg install luci-app-firewall luci-mod-admin-full luci-proto-ppp</p><p>Package dependencies will install everything else automatically.<br />Note: I&#039;m not sure if this includes everything the default LuCI has. So if you miss something in LuCI you have to install the missing packages by yourself.</p><p>Have fun! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Cypher</strong> on 7 Feb 2012, 22:39)</p>
