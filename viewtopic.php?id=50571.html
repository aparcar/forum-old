					<p>Hey Guys - </p><p>After switching from DD-WRT to OpenWRT 2-3 months ago, I&#039;m beyond glad I did.&nbsp; DD-WRT is excellent, but OpenWRT provides just that many more possiblities.</p><p>When moving this weekend, I ran across hardware that I really need for my new place - a Netgear WN2500RP wireless repeater.&nbsp; It has the latest OEM firmware (1.0.0.30_1.0.58) which works, but I&#039;d like to apply an OpenWRT build if only for stability alone as I realize it&#039;s not a full router therefore won&#039;t be able to use many of the OpenWRT features.</p><p>After searching forums and Google, I unfortunately found no mention (or posts with replies) about the WN2500RP.&nbsp; </p><p>Does anyone know of OpenWRT builds which may work with it - or if not - another open source firmware?</p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>BzowK</strong> on 12 May 2014, 17:01)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m also interested in putting some custom firmware on the WN2500RPv2. From what I&#039;ve read here, it sounds like it can be a 4-port wired router with wrt but the wifi won&#039;t work? I&#039;d be interested if it can still function as repeater of wifi with custom fw, because the default settings say that you can only map one band at a time to ethernet. I want to get 2.4ghz band from one network, and 5ghz from another, then use the internet on over ethernet basically using the WN2500RPv2 to bridge 2 wifi networks into one ethernet connection. Heck, even just having it map dual bands to ethernet from 1 network should give it much better performance and reliability that the current implementation.</p>									</div>
