					<p>Hello,all:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;m a new beginner in OpenWRT, and I have read some faqs and documents about it posted in this web site, but still don&#039;t know how to build a development environment for OpenWRT, nor how to build an image for a certain paltform. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; So, anyone that can give me an introduction with pictures of screen captured would be greatly appreciated.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks in advance for your answer.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; My Email: afeionline@hotmail.com</p>									</div>

					<p>If you ask a specific question maybe I can help you. I don&#039;t think screen captures are so useful for you to understand...<br />The Buildroot environment in its structure is very similar to the kernel-compiler one...</p>									</div>
