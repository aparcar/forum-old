					<p>Hi gurus,</p><p>I have a network that was linked to a Linksys router, it has IPs in 192.168.1.x, the router links to&nbsp; DSL. I have another LAN, independent of the first one, just an internal network with IPs in the 192.168.10.x. Now, I like to put a OpenWRT box between the two networks so that the 2nd network can access to the Internet as well, is this possible with OpenWRT? Thanks,</p><p>Angelo</p>									</div>
