					<p>I am new to OpenWrt, my company has decided to use OpenWrt with Asterisk and design a custom interface originally we were going to use NETGEAR WNR3500Lv2 Gigabit Open Source Router as its cheap and has 128 MB Flash Memory from a solid brand.</p><p>Unfortunately after getting familiar with OpenWrt we found out that it&#039;s not supported and neither are we able to find something similar well supported with the latest firmware therefore I am asking for any recommendations of a device which is well supported with OpenWrt, please give me some ideas including links to resources about the same topic.</p><p>At the same time give me your input if it&#039;s worth to wait for the new Linksys wrt1900ac or the are other alternatives for much cheaper</p><p>I would like to see at least<br />CPU Speed: 400<br />Flash Size: 128<br />Gigabit Ports<br />Wireless</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>How much is affordable? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> 128MB flash is a lot! Most of the better routers has 8MB or 16MB flash. My favorite is TL WR1043nd v2, it has 64MB RAM, 8MB flash, but you can extend the flash with usb flash drive, it is cheap and runs at 720MHz.</p>									</div>

					<p>The Netgear WNDR3700 <strong>v4</strong> or the WNDR4300 might be what you need. Make sure to investigate how well they&#039;re supported by OpenWrt though, it looks like 12.09 (Attitude Adjustment) does not support them, there might be some support in trunk (&#039;Barrier Breaker&#039;), and I&#039;ve read about someone creating images for the latter.</p>									</div>
