					<p>Hi,</p><p>Is there anyone runs Kamikaze 2.4 kernel, openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx, on Netgear WGT634U instead of 2.6 kernel openwrt-wgt634u-2.6-squashfs.bin?</p><p>Since there is no JTAG, got to ask and make sure it&#039;s safe wont brick the WGT634U.</p><p>thanks in advance!</p>									</div>

					<p>I mean just the most current 2.4 image from download section under Kamikaze. Would it be safe to load on WGT634U instead of 2.6? This Netgear has a USB port plus 32MB RAM, I thought better than my WRT54G.</p><p>I want to get Asterisk loaded on WGT634U, but I couldn&#039;t find 2.6 kernel compiled 1.4.13 Asterisk ipk. Besides, with 2.6 running on WGT634U, I failed to setup WPA sta nonbeacon link using wpa_supplicant to my whiterussian WRT54G AP co-exists with a WPA AP using hostapd, on madwifi it supports 4AP+1sta in theory. So want to try my luck on 2.4 kernel.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Fall</strong> on 15 Dec 2007, 17:49)</p>

					<p>Hi, </p><p>I donÂ´t know if a 2.4 image will work. but if you have access to the bootloader through a serialconsolecable, you normally canÂ´t brick your&nbsp; wgt634u completely with installing&nbsp; an image. you can always download another image with tftp. <br />Without a serialconsole-cable you should be careful because I think the cfe of the wgt634u has no automatic tftp-upload. so you need access to the bootloader to start the tftp-transfer.</p><p>but I would try to get it working with the 2.6 kernel. <br />the sta- and ap-configuration. I had it done on a fonera (atheros2.6 with atheros-wifi) so I think it should work on the&nbsp; wgt634u too. </p><p>and you can compile asterix 1.4.11. for the 2.6 kernel (I donÂ´t use it, but it compiles just fine), I donÂ´t know where you get the version 1.4.13, because the newest version (also in trunk) that you can get from the openwrt-project is 1.4.11</p>									</div>

					<p>I tried for days of setting up WPA AP and STA with hostapd and wpa_supplicant.</p><p>I read sample setup online, for AP and STA from madwifi site, it most talking about non-WPA, WEP or just open to world non-encrypted. Would love to get some help on how to setup AP and sta with WPA on my WGT634U. When I created ath0 and ath1, ath0 for&nbsp; hostapd, ath1 for wpa_supplicant, wpa_cli status shows it never completes the handshake. Most of the time is associating. But if I remove hostapd just create the ath0 with sta, use ath0 for wpa_supplicant, it would complete handshake in seconds.<br />Forgot to mention I couldn&#039;t never get brctl works with WPA_supplicant sta ath0 interface. If I do brctl addif br-lan ath0, the connected WPA link would drop back to associating forever and ifconfig shows ath0 down.<br />Linksys&#039; nas is much stable compared to madwifi, I was able to setup WPA wds and ap with different SSID co-exist on the same WRT54G.</p><p>For asterisk, here is the link for 4.1.13.<br /><a href="http://members.home.nl/hans.zandbelt/openwrt/kamikaze/7.09/">http://members.home.nl/hans.zandbelt/op … kaze/7.09/</a>.</p><p>Zandbelt puts his great effort maintained a up-to-date working stream of ipk packages for Openwrt. I was just to copy the link here in this post just now and found out he already compiled it for 2.6 kernel last night/This morning.</p><p>Thank you, Zandbelt!!!</p><p>The asterisk package from openwrt was outdated. I use Zandbelt&#039;s version to run asterisk on openwrt providing some wonderful features for my home phone systems.<br />I have my PSTN line routed into asterisk by a SPA3102, I got SIP line from vbuzzer for $2/month plus free talking to gtalk users from my home phone. And scripted in home automation heyu with asterisk so I can call to turn a light on/off, just for fun...</p>									</div>
