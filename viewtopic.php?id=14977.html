					<p>When I tried to compile the Kamikaze (r10627) with 2.6 version of the kernel, it booted correctly until it detected the Broadcom WiFi card:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>br-lan: port 1(eth0.0) entering forwarding state

					<p>I was trying to compile the newest version of the b43.ko module (taken from <a href="http://linuxwireless.org/download/compat-wireless-2.6/compat-wireless-2.6.tar.bz2">http://linuxwireless.org/download/compa â€¦ .6.tar.bz2</a>).<br />After some minor adjustments the code compiled cleanly, but anyway it exhibits the same behaviour.<br />The system reboots, no message is displayed neither on the serial console nor via the syslogd (I have run the &quot; syslogd -l 8 -L -R 192.168.1.2:5514 -n&nbsp; &quot; after killing the original syslogd).<br />I have even compiled kernel with the addtional &quot;debug=8&quot; parameter.<br />Has someone any ideas how to isolate the problem?<br />PS. To avoid continuous rebooting, I have installed not the kmod-b43_2.6.23.16~m47xx-1_mipsel.ipk package, but only the data.tar.gz extracted from it. Then I have moved the b43.ko to the /home directory. Otherwise, after each reboot the router insmoded the b43.ko automatically and rebooted cyclically.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wzab</strong> on 24 Mar 2008, 01:33)</p>
