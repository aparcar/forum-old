					<p>OK danymarc, I understand it, I use OpenWRT since more than 6 years <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>But I think in beginners...</p><p>but what I say is that LuCi is not working to change the password.</p><p>I have no proble with it. In most cases I use command line, but my question is:</p><p>is it about a LuCI bug?</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>									</div>

					<p>I ran into this issue with my TP-Link TL-MR3020 on Chaos Calmer 15.05, but it turns out it was a browser cache issue I think... I cleared cache and was able to set the password via LuCI.</p><p>One oddity though... after being unable to log in or set the password after a reset, I used telnet to set the passwd. After that, LuCI still said no passwd was set. Either way, a browser cache clear fixed my issue.</p>									</div>
