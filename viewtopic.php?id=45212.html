					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I am trying to work with a build for Westell 7500, which I have found through research is very close to 96358VW2 except the GPIO mappings are off; definition for green power LED is mapped to GPIO5 which on the Westell, GPIO 5is really to enable/disable the switch.&nbsp; I plan to research and fix the GPIO mappings so that all the LEDs work properly, and the switch is enabled with a reset flash as currently I have to add an echo line to send a brightness control to what the firmware thinks is the power LED.</p><p>But first I need a functioning build environment.&nbsp; The installation instructions seem to have a bit of a conflict when it comes to downloading the main and package repositories for Attitute Adjustment.</p><p>My initial environment:<br />Fedora 18 x32 on VBox<br />Using the bcm63xx target<br />My top directory for all this is ~/openwrt/12.09 - where I will be using Attitude Adjustment: 12.09.<br />I also have a top folder ~openwrt/trunk to test out the trunk, particularly for comparisons.<br />Installed all recommended packages in Fedora, found I also needed gcc-java, which then installs ecj.&nbsp; By the way, the check for Java in the make generates deprication warnings.</p><p>Here&#039;s the conflict:<br />According to Buildroot-installation, it is recommended to use GIT for checking out soure code.<br />git clone git://git.openwrt.org/12.09/openwrt.git generates subfolder openwrt<br />git clone git://git.openwrt.org/12.09/packages.git generates subfolder packages, which doesn&#039;t seem to have any connection with sibling folder openwrt.<br />svn info command won&#039;t work in this situation, doesn&#039;t seem to see any download, though I have seen svn used in the make process.</p><p>The svn method &quot;svn co svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/branches/attitude_adjustment&quot; generates subfolder attitude-adjustment.&nbsp; I read in the install that git is needed for some of the packages so I thought I needed to use the git method of obtaining the source code, but I think I see now, it meant I needed the Fedora git package, not necessarily the git method of setting up the sources.</p><p>I downloaded the config template config.brcm63xx_generic which I was suprised to find &quot;Select all packages by default&quot; in the Global Build Settings.&nbsp; I would think that most of the resulting packages aren&#039;t needed or recommended by any of the defined boards.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to have a config that has a reasonable selection of packages for this target, particularly for what generated openwrt-96358VW2-generic-squashfs-cfe.bin that one can download.</p><p>But using the config template as-is, several of the packages generated errors during compile.&nbsp; So far I came across:<br />appweb<br />dhcpd<br />etherpuppet<br />libzstream (needed for freecwmp)<br />libowfat (needed for gatling)<br />shflags (download failure I think)<br />gesftpserver<br />Netatalk</p><p>I am still eliminating the problem packages until i get a successfull build.</p><p>Somewhere down the line I started getting the following error when I made changes in menuconfig:<br />tmp/.config-package.in:17709:warning: &#039;select&#039; used by config symbol &#039;PACKAGE_deluge-ui-gtk&#039; refer to undefined symbol &#039;PACKAGE_python-gtk&#039;<br />tmp/.config-package.in:22275:warning: &#039;select&#039; used by config symbol &#039;PACKAGE_bmx6-quagga&#039; refer to undefined symbol &#039;PACKAGE_qmp-quagga&#039;<br />tmp/.config-package.in:46773:warning: &#039;select&#039; used by config symbol &#039;PACKAGE_lcd4linux-custom&#039; refer to undefined symbol &#039;PACKAGE_libdpf&#039;<br />tmp/.config-package.in:46805:warning: &#039;select&#039; used by config symbol &#039;PACKAGE_lcd4linux-full&#039; refer to undefined symbol &#039;PACKAGE_libdpf&#039;</p><p>I focused on deluge-ui-gtk to try and troubleshoot the problem.&nbsp; Indeed there doesn&#039;t seem to be a package python-gtk so i understand the error.&nbsp; But I can&#039;t find deluge anywhere in menuconfig.&nbsp; I looked at the package make, whcih suggests it is supposed to be under Network\Bitorrent in menuconfig but it is not there, neither is deluge, which depends on deluge-ui-gtk.&nbsp; I suspect the other 3 have the same issue.&nbsp; How do I get rid of these errors, and if these packages are in development, how did they get into Attitude Adjustment?&nbsp; I would have only expected this under trunk.</p><p>If I can obtain a better config template that more closely follows what&#039;s in the prebuilt .bin&#039;s one can download, that would certainly get around much of the above problems, let alone save me a heck of a lot of time generating builds.</p><p>Thanks all.</p>									</div>

					<p>I managed to get a little further.<br />I redid my build directories for 12.09 and trunk, using svn rather than git to populate them.<br />I also noticed in the readme I found in attitude_adjustment/12.09 under the download site that I should check out the source from svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/tags/attitude_adjustment_12.09/<br />I also noticed in the directions for an install of the buildroot that running ./scripts/feeds upate -a and ./scripts/feeds/ install -a were optional, so I didn&#039;t do those.<br />That created a successful build.&nbsp; However, my openwrt-96358VW2-generic-squashfs-cfe.bin is only 2.6MB whereas the one in Downloads is 2.8MB so something is missing though probably not critical.&nbsp; I can&#039;t test this image right now as I gave the Westell I had been working on to my church but I have one on order, should arrive by next week.</p><p>I also redid the trunk buildroot, also not downloading any feed packages.&nbsp; Setting only some basic items in menuconfig, no packages selected, the build errored out compiling ead: missing asm/linkage.h.<br />I noticed that the package compile logs are in different areas for trunk versus 12.09.&nbsp; In the former, I found the compile log for ead under trunk/logs/package/networks/services/ead, in the latter &lt;12.09&gt;/logs/package/ead.&nbsp; IOW the release 12.09 doesn&#039;t subcategorize packages but trunk does.&nbsp; Also menuconfig is much different between the two.<br />Since not applying feeds seemed to be a factor, I am going to try using the same .config for trunk that i used for the 12.09 that worked.</p><p>I did change the target profile from Broadcom WiFi to Broadcom BCM43xx since there is a 4318 radio in the Westell, that may explain the differences in image sizes.</p><p>Also noticed that trunk moved reset to defaults, load alternate and save alternate over to the select/exit/help at the bottom.</p>									</div>

					<p>Tried using the config that was successful with the pristine 12.09.&nbsp; It compiled a lot more but still failed at ead:<br />/home/danman32/openwrt/trunk/trunk/build_dir/target-mips_uClibc-0.9.33.2/linux-brcm63xx_generic/linux-3.9.8/include/linux/linkage.h:5:25: fatal error: asm/linkage.h: No such file or directory</p><p>Intially had a problem getting mac80211 to compile, but after running &#039;make dirclean&#039;, it compiled.</p><p>ead make file indicates dependence on libpcap, which before with the limited build was not selected, but now it is.&nbsp; I&#039;d say maybe it needs to be a built-in module, but it didn&#039;t need to be in the 12.09 build.<br />This problem cropped up last May, apparently the kernel was bumped up while someone was building, causing mismatch between his builds.<br />Ran svn update, sure enough svn info shows a change this evening.</p>									</div>

					<p>Poking around the stock firmware through telnet (after adding /sbin/telnetd to custom firewall script), I was able to gather the GPIO mappings for the LEDs and buttons:<br /> HW(GPIO pin)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DIR&nbsp; &nbsp;Desc<br /> 13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PowerGrn<br /> 10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PowerRed<br /> 3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DSLGrn<br /> 24&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DSLRed<br /> 2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IntGrn<br /> 22&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IntRed<br /> 23&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; UsbGrn<br /> 8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Btn:Reset(Easy)<br /> 1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; WireGrn<br /> 26&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; EasyGrn<br /> 37&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Btn:Easy(Reset)<br /> 5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SwitchEnable</p><p>Wire=Wireless LED<br />Easy=Easy Wireless config LED under the Easy Config button<br />Int=WAN LED<br />DSL=DSL LED (not present in 7501)<br />Switch enable is tied to GPIO5 and needs to be set; default setting leaves it disabled.<br />I do know which GPIO&#039;s are used for the two buttons, but not sure which order.<br />With that, we can add a customization for a Westell 750x board that properly supports the LEDs and buttons.</p><p>I ran into a snag installing the CFE.&nbsp; Apparently the CFE6358.bin doesn&#039;t support the flash ID on the 7501 &quot;flash device ID 257e is not supported&quot;, but does support the ID for the 7500 apparently as a few of us have done it.&nbsp; I have a 7501 though for my lab work.&nbsp; If I can get the NVRAM sections of the CFE off of a working 96358VW2 based router, then I probably can inject that into the flash, so then perhaps the CFE won&#039;t complain about the flash ID.&nbsp; I am not seeing any plain text in the bin under a hex editor, so I suspect the CFE is encrypted.<br />I&#039;ve been manually trying to calculate the values, but I must have them all wrong.</p>									</div>
