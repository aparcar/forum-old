					<p>I have a situation that I am at a loss how to implement, or if it is even possible.</p><p>My ISP allots 3 IP addresses assigned by DHCP.&nbsp; I have 7 computers in the house using both wireless and wired connections.&nbsp; Would it be possible to have 1 ISP IP address asigned to the router, then to have 2 of the ISP assigned DHCP addresses relayed through the router to 2 specific MAC addresses, while ALSO having the other computers be assigned by DHCP from the router?&nbsp; (I would then make one of the machines with a router assigned IP address the DMZ, so it would be like having 3 external IP addresses.)</p><p>If this is possible, can anyone explain how?&nbsp; (Without using two routers?)</p>									</div>
