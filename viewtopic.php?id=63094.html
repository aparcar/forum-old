					<p>Hello!</p><p>I&#039;m new to the forum, and as a bit of a tweaker, I have messed about with OpenWRT now and again.</p><p>I decided to follow this tutorial to install the latest OpenWRT on a BT Homehub 5A, located here: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/bt/homehub_v5a.">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/bt/homehub_v5a.</a>&nbsp; It looks as though the image was missing, but I managed to successfully compile this overnight and it successfully flashed onto the Home Hub a couple of hours ago.&nbsp; Btw, if anyone is looking for the openwrt-lantiq-xrx200-BTHOMEHUBV5A-ubifs-sysupgrade.tar image, as it appears to have been pulled at some point from the sources, The one I compiled and flashed is uploaded it here: <a href="http://www.commolly.co.uk/openwrt-lantiq-xrx200-BTHOMEHUBV5A-ubifs-sysupgrade.tar">www.commolly.co.uk/openwrt-lantiq-xrx200-BTHOMEHUBV5A-ubifs-sysupgrade.tar</a>.&nbsp; It&#039;s hosted at home, so please be patient - perhaps someone can add it to the images?</p><p>It appears stable enough, as it hasn&#039;t crashed.&nbsp; But, it hasn&#039;t been doing much either.&nbsp; The package locations aren&#039;t set and I&#039;ve had some trouble doing this.&nbsp; I manually set the opkg config file and managed to install LuCi.&nbsp; I&#039;ve enabled and started the webserver, and having it hooked up via ethernet to the linux deskop I&#039;m using, I cannot for the life of me access the LuCi webpage.</p><p>Right now I&#039;m downloading the packages for the platform, and I&#039;ll install things locally once this is done (USB flash drive to hand). </p><p>In the meantime though, I could do with some help with accessing LuCi.&nbsp; I&#039;ve not changed any defaults, and as previously stated, I&#039;ve enabled the http server.&nbsp; The router is pinging my local machines so it has local connectivity.</p><p>Next I&#039;m going to try and disable the firewall, hands full right this second, but if that doesn&#039;t help, I&#039;m at a loss.</p><p>Any idea what I&#039;m missing or overlooking?</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Chris.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>connchri</strong> on 2 Mar 2016, 16:37)</p>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>Sorry for that.&nbsp; It is indeed Plusnet.&nbsp; It&#039;s ADSL.&nbsp; It was syncing with ADSL2+ at ~ 20Mbps down, 1Mbps up.&nbsp; Although that config was set to ptm when I copied it over, I had tried atm - I just didn&#039;t revert it back before posting this.</p><p>I&#039;m thinking that I&#039;ve perhaps got some packages missing, but at the moment I&#039;ve got a bigger issue.&nbsp; I was messing with virtual switches on it, and I have somehow locked myself out by mistake.&nbsp; Trouble is I can&#039;t get it in recovery mode either, as I was hoping to start a fresh - followed the guides, and looked over the forums (and the net) and it&#039;s just not being compliant.&nbsp; It&#039;s still booting, and broadcasting the WiFi I set up, and all the ports are bridged - so it&#039;s acting as little more than just an access point now.</p><p>Back to soldering the uart connection again...</p><p>Then I&#039;ll build another image with the additional packages (I think I may have missed br2684ctl, I assumed it is included as default).</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>connchri</strong> on 4 Mar 2016, 20:16)</p>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>Sorry for the delay - had a busy weekend with mother&#039;s day and all.</p><p>I haven&#039;t had much success with the ADSL connection, but to be fair, I put this entirely down to my own ignorance on how to do it correctly.&nbsp; Stability wise, I&#039;ve had the thing running for days on end now, without any apparent hiccup so I think it&#039;s perfectly stable.</p><p>I can use Linux perfectly fine, but I&#039;m still in the early day&#039;s of comprehensively being able to configure it and learning it as well as I do on Windows.&nbsp; </p><p>Last I was at it, I was setting up some vlans, as I work from home and want my home office (fairly comprehensive with multiple machines, a micro server, printers, and VOIP phones) completely segregated from the home network, as getting an ISP package with multiple IP&#039;s is costly. I&#039;ve got that almost the way I want it. I&#039;ll then go back to having a go at getting the ADSL connection working correctly but I do have a spare Linksys AM200 modem that I&#039;ll end up using if I don&#039;t get any success.&nbsp; </p><p>How are you getting on?&nbsp; Did you get round to flashing it?&nbsp; If so, have you got an internet connection going with the onboard modem?&nbsp; Are you on ADSL or Fibre?</p><p>Just a wee word of advice, once you have soldered on your TTL/Serial connection, don&#039;t remove them!&nbsp; Make some sort of semi-permanent header on the board.&nbsp; I got a bit too optimistic and pulled them off and then needed to recover from the uart serial connection again, after messing up the network settings, - and it&#039;s 10 times harder soldering onto the same place a second time with the pads being so small.&nbsp; The second time I stuck down some female 2.54mm socket headers so I can go back to the uart connection if I ever need to.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>connchri</strong> on 8 Mar 2016, 20:12)</p>

					<p>It&#039;s already in the trunk. I am using unmodified trunk for my build. I am very happy with its stability, good synchronisation on vdsl and adsl (I have both at 2 different locations). <br/>I guess the official images will appear when DD becomes final, until then you&#039;ll have to build them on your own or have someone share their images.</p>									</div>
