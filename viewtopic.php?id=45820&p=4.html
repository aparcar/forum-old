Either the SDHC driver is poorly coded (we can&#039;t know until they release the source), or there&#039;s a limitation in the &quot;switch&quot; that prioritises the external host. I can only guess.</p><p>I&#039;ve been looking over their modifications to the Busybox source, trying to figure out how files are synchronized between the two systems. Let me share what I&#039;ve learned:<br /></p><ol class="decimal"><li><p>/etc/init.d/rcS calls /usr/bin/kcard_app.sh which forks the kcard_app Busybox applet during startup</p></li><li><p>kcard_app registers a SIGUSR1 handler and gives its PID to the SDHC driver by sending an ioctl to /dev/ka-main</p></li><li><p>When the SIGUSR1 handler is triggered by the driver, it requests a command from /dev/ka-main using another ioctl</p></li><li><p>The kcard_* applets then do a lot of extraneous stuff (checking for control images) using hardcoded system calls (yuck!) and remount /mnt/sd a few times</p></li></ol><p>I wrote a wrapper for the ioctl syscall so I could interact with /dev/ka-main from a shell script (source below). Here&#039;s a <a href="https://mega.co.nz/#!wBFxwaKL!Yb5Ij06v6_Nn1oU-2cDhxCia63x5xf25SOSB7cAnOvQ">compiled</a> version for those who don&#039;t have a cross-compiler set up. I&#039;m not great at C, so please don&#039;t laugh at me too hard. Just drop it in /sbin.<br />I then wrote a shell script to perform the minimum necessary functions of the kcard_* applets, namely remounting /mnt/sd when instructed by the SDHC driver. There are a bunch of undocumented ioctls I found in their Busybox source too. Save it as /usr/bin/kcard_handler.<br />Finally, I wrote a new rcS by tracing through the existing one, removing extraneous crap (logging, wifi, http) and re-ordering parts, shaving the boot time down to 6.5 seconds. This script forks my custom kcard_handler if it exists.</p><p>The source code for all of the above can be found here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6787023">https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6787023</a>.<br />For the super-lazy, an initramfs.gz with my changes applied can be found <a href="https://mega.co.nz/#!tVkWwIZC!fZZvIDk6mOeAgKe-vXAv5GXUhI0SXOzlusILM7otyKk">here</a>. You&#039;ll have to start wifi/telnetd from autorun.sh if you haven&#039;t soldered a serial cable to the card.</p><p>From testing with my camera and computer, the SDHC driver appears to only care about updates to the DCIM folder, not the entire filesystem, partition or block device. Writing to the card with my computer makes it choke on failed reads when remounting, so I may be doing something wrong.<br />This is all the progress I think I can make until Transcend/KeyASIC decides to release the source for /lib/ka2000-sdhc.ko.<br />Hopefully this ends up helping people, especially the guy working on a builtroot config to replace the initramfs. I look forward to viewing your progress!</p><p>Now, I have some questions of my own:<br /></p><ol class="decimal"><li><p>Has anyone had success using fakeroot as a normal user to unpack/repack the initramfs?</p></li><li><p>Does anyone feel brave enough to start fuzzing for new ioctls? Both /dev/ka-pwm and /dev/ka-pwm1 are undocumented.</p></li></ol>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kcard</strong> on 2 Oct 2013, 03:19)</p>

					<p>kcard: that kcard handler you wrote will be useful. I have cross-compiling working, and I&#039;m learning my way around buildroot enough to customize the rootfs. As soon as my initramfs boots, I&#039;ll put up a repo with my work.</p><p>Ideally, any original code in my initramfs should either be in ash or lua. The idea here being that users can audit and contribute to the code without worrying about a cross-compile environment. Lua has a decent posix lib, so I might just take what you&#039;ve done and port it to lua.</p><p>In my rootfs, I intend on using the writable 1M partition for a lot of user configurable stuff. This includes conf for hostapd, busybox httpd, telnet, ftp and dropbear ssh, as well as the ability to add new init scripts. Since you will be able to configure httpd, you&#039;ll also be able to keep lua scripts in the writable partition that are run as CGIs. (Interestingly, my PQI Air Card has a 1.8MB writable partition)</p><p>I hope to have lua libs for google drive, dropbox, and box.com on the device. It will also have dropbear (ssh) and rsync binaries on it. There will be lots of ways to get your files off of the internal SD card.</p><p>At the rate I&#039;m going (slowly, with family and a full-time job), it might be done early next week.</p>									</div>

					<p>kcard: it seems that /dev/ka-pwm and ka-pwm1 are intended to control speakers. See busybox-1.20.2_KA/kcard/buzzer.c in the kcard busybox source. It seems that pwm stands for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">pulse-width modulation</a> in this case. It looks like buzzer.c makes it pretty clear how to use this device node, however this is most likely an unused feature of the chipset that these cards are based on.

					<p>So I&#039;ve built my initramfs3.gz replacement, and my PQI AirCard boots. Unfortunately, wifi doesn&#039;t come up. Troubleshooting that is a pain in the ass without a serial console. I don&#039;t have the equipment to get access to the hardware console at the moment. I&#039;m still working on the wifi issue though, it&#039;ll just take a while. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s something simple that I just can&#039;t see without a console. I&#039;m troubleshooting by adding a ton of logging to my init scripts.</p><p>In addition to that, I might actually be able to get buildroot to build a usable kernel, using Dmitry Grinberg&#039;s kernel patch. It will essentially be the same kernel as the one he released, but you&#039;ll be able to re-build it with different options using the same buildroot setup that builds the initramfs.</p><p>As long as I can get past the wifi issue, it&#039;s still looking like it&#039;ll be ready early next week.</p><p><strong>Edit</strong>: typo</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dankrause</strong> on 4 Oct 2013, 19:53)</p>

					<p>That ultrastick looks like it&#039;s just an sdio 3g card. There&#039;s no reason to believe that it has an OS at all, let alone a hackable linux/busybox system. However, a 3g variant of these keyasic-based cards <em>would</em> be awesome.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dankrause</strong> on 7 Oct 2013, 20:07)</p>

					<p>So I&#039;m still stuck on a wifi-related issue. Thanks to pixelk, I have a modified PQI Air Card with console access on the way. I&#039;ve temporarily stopped work on this until the card arrives, because I&#039;m not making any real progress.</p>									</div>

					<p>I was just reading that article. What I personally think is that he&#039;d be better served by wiring the serial tx and rx to pins 8 and 9 (unused) of the SD card. That would be a lot less hacky than passing commands through the SD storage.</p>									</div>

					<p>When you are soldering things on with a microscope and accidentally rip a trace off, you start to look for better solutions.&nbsp; Also, there is already a terminal running on that port.</p><p>Besides, hopefully people are going to improve the interface there, possibly support some of the RAM-based or other non-flash mechanisms to communicate outside.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah, I agree that the pads are tough to work with - I wouldn&#039;t attempt it myself. It would be nice to get access to that serial port without some wires dangling out. Disabling the terminal on that port is trivial, especially when you build your own userland. I&#039;m working on doing that from scratch with buildroot right now.</p><p>It would also be pretty interesting to reverse engineer the SDHC hardware in there, and have a modified kernel module for it. You&#039;d have your AVR abusing the SPI bus to communicate with the host. I doubt someone will the skill do accomplish that would be interested enough in this little wifi sd card to actually go through with it though.</p>									</div>

					<p>Cnlohr, I see that your board uses a ATMega168. Would it be possible to port your code to arduino ? I lack the expertise in AVR programming to do so myself. It would unleash this beast for a LOT of people (anybody can get an arduino and a SD Shield).</p>									</div>

					<p>I do think it would be possible to use the 1-bit mode, if 1-bit support was added to the kernel driver, I do not expect SPI mode to be supportable at all since it appears to be electrically incompatible with the host: <a href="http://imgur.com/I7lu44g">http://imgur.com/I7lu44g</a>&nbsp; (The area that&#039;s in the middle is the card yelling back at me on the MOSI line)</p><p>Regarding an SD Shield on an arduino... If 1-bit mode could be supported by a driver, then it is feasible, however, as of now, it does not appear to be the case.</p><p>It would take a custom shield, and a custom module for an arduino at this point... I don&#039;t actually own an arduino or the pins to make something I make become a shield <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" />.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have never worked with arduinos, the build environment was too clunky when I played with my friend&#039;s.&nbsp; But, if people want it, I would consider trying to figure out how all that works to make a 4-bit SD bus compatible arduino library...</p>									</div>

					<p>The arduino build environment hasn&#039;t changed much. It&#039;s a bane for experienced avr programmer as much as a strength for noobs like me. In my opinion the best solution would be to port your 4-bit protocol implementation to an arduino lib.<br />If you see any way I could help you in this project please do tell me.</p>									</div>
