					<p>Hello all,</p><p>I&#039;m afraid I bricked my router TL-WR741ND v1.8. After successful installing <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-tl-wr741nd-v1-squashfs-factory.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 â€¦ actory.bin</a> , I tried to make my own image using the image builder to save some space. So I listed all packages currently installed on this firmware version and removed all *luci* packages, because I wanted only access it via SSH.</p><p>I also included my config files by adding the FILES= parameter on make.</p><p>I used the procedure <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd</a> and tried to upload via netcat:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>On the router run:
root@OpenWrt:/# nc -l -p 1234 | mtd write - firmware

On your system run:
user@yourpc:~% nc -q0 192.168.1.1 1234 &lt; openwrt.bin</code></pre></div><p>wherenever it finished uploading I typed reboot on the router and now it doesn&#039;t answer anything. Sometimes it is possible to ping it when it is booting (it answers only three times) and then the SYS LED stops blinking and is kept ON.</p><p>I have tried telnet&#039;ing to it on ports 22, 23 and 9000 when it answer but all I get is connection refused. </p><p>I&#039;m thinking of creating a cable to connect to it via console on its SJ1 port, but I don&#039;t know what to do next. Tried to contact TP-LINK support, but nothing yet.</p><p>Does anyone knows a way to unbrick it? Any procedure to reflash it via console through SJ1?</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p><p>Marcus</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey Tom,</p><p>Thank you very much for the reply. I&#039;m going to try to make the cable and I&#039;ll post it when finished.</p><p>BTW, I&#039;m running now a TL-WR1043ND with a USB Hub I have extended its memory by using a pen drive. Also, it is now a 3G router <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile"/></p><p>Regards,</p><p>Marcus</p>									</div>
