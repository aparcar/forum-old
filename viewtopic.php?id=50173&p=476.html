					<p>hi<br />i asked this before and many others too.<br />How to create a separate lan with vlans?<br />I read all post and guides but i dont get this sorry.<br />This 2 CPU Ports confuses me.<br />Normally you just set cpu to be tagged on every vlan or?</p><p>Im using the wrt1200ac.</p><p>The default switch config looks like this i think:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config switch

Can someone please tell me why this works.<br />I also tought when vlans are enabled eth1 bridge isnt suppose to work anymore?

					<p>Bridged interfaces are set by</p><p>option type &#039;bridge&#039;</p><p>in the &#039;config interface&#039; stanza.</p><p>on the 1200 the WAN port is eth0, which is connected to port 5 on the switch. The LAN is eth1, which is port 6 on the switch. The GUI doesn&#039;t have a feature for two CPU ports, so it shows only 5 right now.</p><p>So, if you want VLANs on the LAN interface, add them with &#039;6t&#039; as the CPU port and add a corresponding eth1.X interface. For WAN, that&#039;d be eth0.X with &#039;5t&#039; as the CPU port.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for your answer.<br />When i set the port 6 to tagged for the lan.<br />Do i create new interface with eth1.x ? <br />Or do i change the current bridge interface to eth1.x?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Everyone - I just updated to David&#039;s latest build Firmware version OpenWrt Designated Driver r49377 / LuCI Master (git-16.151.26687-f4af114), Kernel 4.4.7, on the Linksys 1900ACS</p><p>Working great so far, but: </p><p>I&#039;m seeing the issue with only one wireless network working. Both are recognized, but only the 5GHZ one is accepting clients. I seem to remember a couple of posts addressing this with a configuration change, but for the life of me I cannot find the post. Does anyone happen to have what needs to be changed to fix this? </p><p>Thanks!<br />Paul</p>									</div>
