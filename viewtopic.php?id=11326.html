					<p>Hi@all.</p><p>I am currently working on a better support for the SCTCS (torrent webif) under OpenWRT, so I changed a few things in it, to get it to work as desired. Now all works fine, torrent downloads are working, http daemon and sctcs daemon are starded, If I launch them manually.</p><p>So I had another idea. I have connected my external hdd to the usb - so I could use the red &quot;SES&quot; button on the WL-500GP to start/stop things using the hdd, so that I can attach/detach it, by pressing the button.</p><p>Now here&#039;s the script placed in /etc/hotplug.d/button/:</p><p>SERVICE=&#039;sctscd&#039;</p><p>if [ &quot;$BUTTON&quot; = &quot;ses&quot; ] ; then<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; if [ &quot;$ACTION&quot; = &quot;pressed&quot; ] ; then<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if ps ax | grep -v grep | grep $SERVICE &gt; /dev/null<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; #SCTCS stoppen<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /opt/etc/init.d/S90sctcs stop<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; #SWAP auf ICYBOX deaktivieren<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; swapoff /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part6<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; #ICYBOX unmounten<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; umount /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sleep 3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; else<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; #SWAP auf ICYBOX aktivieren<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; swapon /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part6<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; #ICYBOX nach /opt mounten<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mount /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part5 /opt/<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; #SCTCS starten<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; httpd -c /opt/etc/sctcs_httpd.conf -p 8080 -h /opt/share/www<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /opt/bin/sctcsd 1980 1 &gt; /opt/share/www/sctcs.log &amp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sleep 3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fi<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; fi<br />fi</p><p>The script works, swap is activated/deactivated by pressing the button, also httpd and sctscd are started, but after starting httpd by this script, port 8080 is not accessible at all, httpd uses up to 99% of cpu. The normal webif (port 80) is still accessible, httpd is still working for port 80 - but not for 8080. I can&#039;t understand why manual launch works and launching it by this script is not working. The original httpd startscript supplied with OpenWRT starts the httpd in a similiar way.</p><p>Thx in advance.<br />fireandy</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fireandy</strong> on 22 Jun 2007, 16:41)</p>
