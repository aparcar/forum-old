					<p>Hello,<br />i got Thomson Speedtouch i585 v6. But i did not find any info about launching openwrt on it.</p><p>All the chips in it is created by Broadcom, so i think, it should run some of openwrt.<br />Here`s image: <a href="http://img165.imageshack.us/img165/2396/im000531ac7.jpg">http://img165.imageshack.us/img165/2396/im000531ac7.jpg</a></p><br /><br /><p>This router has not ability to update firmware throught web, or tftp.<br />Firmware is updateable only by launching `special firmware application on windows`.</p><p>So maybe anyone know, ho to try, to launch openwrt on it ?<br />Thanks.</p>									</div>

All Thomson DSL router can be upgraded by tftp. They even have a patent for it.<br /><a href="http://gauss.ffii.org/PatentView/EP1494119">http://gauss.ffii.org/PatentView/EP1494119</a></p><p>The problem is that the software on the router checks the signature of the build. If you do not have the appropriate private key to sign your custom firmware with then you cannot upload it on your device using tftp. This protection was made in reaction to this advisory:<br /><a href="http://security.sdsc.edu/self-help/alcatel/alcatel-bugs.html">http://security.sdsc.edu/self-help/alca … -bugs.html</a><br />You can thank Tsutomu Shimomura (the guy that got Kevin Mitnick in jail) for it. Instead of leaving time to Alcatel to fix it properly, he made his own fix that broke the router in a subtle way. Consequences for the company:<br />1 - They looked like fools.<br />2 - They had support calls from users that installed the broken build instead of waiting. </p><p>If you want to update the firmware of a speedtouch device then you have to use JTAG or find an exploit (good luck, this is neither Linux nor VxWorks). The JTAG port of the 6348 is wide open...</p>									</div>
