					<p>I have OpenWRT setup with my TpLink MR3420 (15.05v) and I have set it up through wifi from my main modem which I use for internet.<br />I am using the Client mode for connecting my MR3420 to the main router.<br />Main router has 192.168.1.1 ip and MR3420 has 192.168.2.1 ip.</p><p>I can use internet and everything is really working good but I cant access main router configuration page when I am connected to MR3420. I know for sure it needs to be done through static routes or IPTables but I dont really know how should I do that.</p><p>I can successfully ping my main router when I am connected through MR3420. And I think the problem is that my main router redirects its configuration page to an address, for example: &quot;something.example.com/index.html&quot; and that&#039;s why connecting it from MR3420 causes a problem and doesn&#039;t resolve the webpage because it thinks that the webpage is in fact from internet but it&#039;s not.</p><p>So the question is that how do I tell the router that *above mentioned* address is in fact 192.168.1.1 so that it opens up the configuration page? Do I need to create a firewall rule for this?</p><p>So please anyone having any knowledge about this help me smile Thanks.<br />P.S. Please tell me if I need to screenshot anything or if you need some more detail regarding the setup.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>redd_llining</strong> on 1 Mar 2016, 12:23)</p>

					<p>Thanks for replying...<br />I think you mean that MR3420 needs an IP from main router and it gets an IP from DHCP server in main router otherwise I wont be able to connect to internet. But I have tried and it doesn&#039;t resolve the web address in any situation. I can ping to main router but when I try to open 192.168.1.1 (main router page) it redirects it to the web address of that router which is good but then shows error that it cant display the webpage. </p><p>Do I need to give it the DNS from my main router as 192.168.1.1? Because for now it uses 192.168.2.1.</p>									</div>

					<p>Correct.</p><p>The default process of a DHCP server when DNS is active, which is the case with OpenWrt + DNSmasq, is to pass a list of resolvers with the local DNS at the top to STA(tions) that request an IP address.&nbsp; Here, understanding the <a href="http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html">functioning</a> of DNSmasq is necessary because it&#039;s DNS(erver) and DHCP server are tightly coupled.&nbsp; DNSmasq imports <strong>upstream</strong> DNS information from the DHCP subsystem of OpenWrt (<em>udhcpc</em>) which are the DNS values the modem&#039;s DHCP client received from the ISP.&nbsp; Here then, is the difference between DNSmasq and a DNS - many modems do not offer a full-function DNS server, only a small application that listens on the DNS port (53) for specific URLs.</p><p>If the modem does not offer a DNS then it will be necessary to &#039;help&#039; DNSmasq help you by adding a directive in <em>/etc/dnsmasq.conf</em> -</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>server=/&lt;magic modem domain&gt;/&lt;modem LAN address&gt;</code></pre></div>									</div>
