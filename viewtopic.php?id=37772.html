					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;ve managed to get my Arduino hooked up a router, flashed with OpenWrt, via its USB port. Everything is hunky-dory, and I can interface via ser2net, and upload new hexes remotely using AVRDude. So far, so good.</p><p>However, I&#039;m having a devil of a time stopping the blasted thing resetting on me when I initiate serial contact. I can&#039;t keep the serial port open (it&#039;s a remotely hosted ruby-on-rails website which pings the board every hour or so). For some reason, the resistor from ground to 5v or 3v trick isn&#039;t working for me (any clues on this? Its an Arduino Mega). </p><p>My web sleuthing has uncovered that I maybe need to disable hupcl (dtr?), but I&#039;m having no luck with that either. Ser2Net has the following settings:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>33:raw:600:/dev/ttyACM0:115200 NONE 1STOPBIT 8DATABITS -XONXOFF -LOCAL -RTSCTS</code></pre></div><p>And the service is started as follows with /etc/init.d/ser2net :</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common
START=10
STOP=15
start(){
        stty -F /dev/ttyACM0 -hupcl
        ser2net
}
stop(){
        killall ser2net
        stty -F /dev/ttyACM0 hupcl
}</code></pre></div><p>What I want to be able to do, here, is autostart ser2net without hupcl for usual processing. Then, when I occassionally want to update the firmware, I should be able to shut ser2net down (and re-engage hupcl) and then do an upload with avrdude.</p><p>But I&#039;m still getting an autoreset on initiation of serial. Bah. Any clues?</p>									</div>

					<p>Good Day MarkPeace,</p><p>Are you able to provide your Router model and Open-WRT version? In addition, what version of the Mega do you have: 1280 or 2560?</p><p>1. I am aware that its a standard practise to reboot the Arduino when serial connects ( <a href="http://arduino.cc/playground/Main/DisablingAutoResetOnSerialConnection">http://arduino.cc/playground/Main/Disab … Connection</a> ) - I assume this is where you got the Resister trick from?<br />2. Have you tried throwing in a capacitor (trick is used on Uno&#039;s): <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1295386772">http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaB … 1295386772</a><br />3. Does the Reset affect your application or just the connection to the Arduino?</p><p>EDIT:: Have you seen this site: <a href="http://www.mydarkmaterials.co.uk/2008/11/30/interfacing-php-with-the-arduino/">http://www.mydarkmaterials.co.uk/2008/1 … e-arduino/</a><br />If you take a look to the comments (about half way down), they threw in a delay between the &quot;stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 -hupcl&quot; and the connection. I am not sure if this would help, as your script includes the -hupcl when the script is run and not when the connection is established, so I assume there is a &quot;delay&quot; already?</p><p>I, currently, do not have Open-WRT loaded on a device, but I am willing to setup one of my TP-Link WR1043ND (Atheros Based) and hook up my Arduino Mega (FreeTronric&#039;s EtherMega) vai usb to help trouble shoot with you.</p><p>If you are willing, could you share what proccess you took to get your Router setup with OpenWRT, Ser2Net and AVRDude? Did you require any additional USB storage etc &gt; currently I have an ext2 4GB usb drive for my Opt-Ware on DD-WRT. This way I can try help with a simialr setup.</p><p>Regards<br />Twobit</p><p>PS: I came across your post on the Arduino Forums :-)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Twobit</strong> on 29 Jun 2012, 03:07)</p>

					<p>Hiya Twobit - thanks for your response!</p><p>I&#039;m using a TP-Link 703n, flashed with OpenWrt r32481 and a Mega 2560 - its a really nice little set up if I can get over this hump. I&#039;d picked up the resistor trick from the official Arduino page you reference here - it would be so much easier if this worked; I&#039;ve no idea why it isn&#039;t, and I can&#039;t find any other reference to it not working anywhere else. Hmmm. I&#039;ll try the capacitor trick when I get home. I wonder whether its because I&#039;m powering the whole lot as a chain (power to Router, router to arduino via usb) so the voltage is a bit on the low side. It would be a shame to introduce an extra bit of mains to the build just to overcome this, though - I&#039;d prefer a different solution.</p><p>It is software critical - the build is a fermentation controller for beer. Its controlling a solid state relay connected to a fridge, and when the serial reset happens, it triggers &#039;flashing&#039; on the control pin. The result would be rapidly turning the fridge on and off which would do it no good. I&#039;ve also got a timer monitoring how long the relay has been on, and when the serial dips in to check current temperatures, etc, its resetting millis() to 0 I think. </p><p>I&#039;d seen that site, but hadn&#039;t picked up on the delay bit. I&#039;ll give it a go!</p><p>Any assistance with debugging would be gratefully received.&nbsp; I&#039;ll let you know whether the other bits worked before you go to any trouble though. The process was a bit of an unsystematic botch job, but I think the process was as follows...</p><p>- Flash TP-Link 703n with openwrt, connect it to my main network as a wireless client node.</p><p>- (Messed around for a bit getting usb stick working for extra storage, later realised that there was enough internal space left for the various bits I needed, so this was a superfluous step).</p><p>- Got the arduino connected - I think I messed around with instructions here: <a href="http://www.thebmwz3.co.uk/article.php?story=20120611144749730">http://www.thebmwz3.co.uk/article.php?s … 1144749730</a></p><p>- opkg install ser2net</p><p>- vi /etc/ser2net.conf - inserted setting line above.</p><p>- vi /etc/init.d/ser2net - and inserted the settings above</p><p>- restart. Can now telnet to localhost 33 and connect to the arduino serial directly (I think I also opened port 33 in the openwrt firewall).</p><p>- opkg avrdude</p><p>- can now download hexes to the router (I wget them from an external source), and flash using the following command: avrdude -cstk500v2 -p atmega2560 -P /dev/ttyACM0 -b 115200 -U flash:w:sketch.hex</p><p>(I&#039;m pretty sure that&#039;s the process, though I may have missed bits...)</p><p>Cheers <br />Mark.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi MarkPeace,</p><p>Sorry for not replying sooner - there appeared to be a glitch with either OpenWRT&#039;s hosting or my internet connection.</p><p>Glad to hear the capacitor trick worked out :-). I actually have some 703Ns on order, but they not locally available in Australia (3-4weeks good old Hong Hong shipping), however I have setup my RaspberryPi similar to you encase you needed some troubleshooting.</p><p>Im currently away from home (travelling with the Pi), I expect to be back ealy next week.</p><p>With regards to &quot;just trying to figure out a way of turning it on and off programmatically now!&quot;, are you wanting to control the Arduino or the Router (I assume Arduino)... The only way i know (if you want controll of on/off) is to extract a GPIO from the 703N and use that as a DO to an Interupt Port on the Ardiuno.</p><p>Then you can try something like: <a href="http://arduino.cc/playground/Learning/ArduinoSleepCode">http://arduino.cc/playground/Learning/ArduinoSleepCode</a></p><p>703N GPIO Discussions:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=168533#p168533">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 33#p168533</a><br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=34437">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=34437</a></p><p>Regards<br />Twobit</p>									</div>
