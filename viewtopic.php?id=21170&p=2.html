					<p>No, I haven&#039;t seen the 8.09 GUI yet, and if it is a good one, then I&#039;d love to check it out. One more question about the OpwnWRT cabapilities -- WNDR3700 as it stands now doesn&#039;t support &quot;virtual servers&quot; in port forwarding (all D-Link routers I&#039;ve used do). It&#039;s the cabability to forward traffic to different ports than it came in on. Meaning that if I want to remote desktop into 5 PC&#039;s on my network, I can connect to 5 different ports externally, and then have the router forward the traffic to the 3389 port on each machine based on the incoming port (i.e. port 22000 traffic to 192.168.1.100:3389, 22001 to 192.168.1.101:3389, etc.)?. Is OpenWRT able to do this?</p>									</div>

					<p>That&#039;s very much a firewall issue I think, and you can tell iptables to redirect traffic destined for a certain port to go to a certain IP and port, that shouldn&#039;t be a problem I think. Iptables is installed by default on OpenWrt. I can&#039;t promise you you&#039;ll be able to configure it over the GUI though - but the command line shouldn&#039;t give any problem.</p>									</div>

					<p>wndr3700 is not marketed as &quot;open source&quot; by netgear. You are confused with the WNDR3500L, but .. the wndr3500l source code that netgear distributes also has binary parts in it.</p><p>Hein</p>									</div>

					<p>how about asking Netgear directly, at least they can provide a &quot;complementary&quot; WNDR3700&nbsp; because they use OpenWRT as the basis of there own firmware :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>A lot of the binary modules they provide are listed as &#039;GPL/BSD&#039; in the license overview, so either them or Atheros should be able to provide us with the code... I find it really awkward they just include the binary ones, but then again I think with BSD you&#039;re not legally forced to offer the code, you just need to maintain copyright I think. That being said, I&#039;m even less familiar with the BSD license as I am with the (L)GPL ones, I just know GPL is more stringent.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi all... I&#039;m new to openwrt but have 10 years linux admin and embedded development experience. My being a openwrt noob may be the reason these questions may seem silly, so forgive me.</p><p>1. If there is already a telnet server on the WNDR3700 and it&#039;s already openwrt 7.09, what are the major differences between this build and the standard 7.09 besides the obvious proprietary bins?</p><p>2. How much work will it be to get the WNDR3700 to support openssh and usb 3g modems if it already has 7.09 on it?</p><p>3. Is there a web based GUI for quicker config of things like WDS, encryption etc?</p><p>4. Hardware question: I don&#039;t know if you have used linksys N routers like the 350N or 300N, but if you have how does the 3700&#039;s performance compare for things like stability, packet drop rate, wireless range and throughput etc?</p><p>5. If Kamikaze is much like the embedded linux you&#039;d find on Zaurus handheld, then the web interface really is unnecessary for me, I&#039;d rather author the devices as servers over ssh. What is the package support for Kamikaze like and would I be able to run the most popular stuff on this hybrid 7.09 that Netgear ships? Further, as it&#039;s Kamikaze should I be able to use apache server and replace the netgear web interface with my own code?</p><p>diJenerate</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>diJenerate</strong> on 30 Oct 2009, 16:27)</p>

					<p>I can partially answer you on point 4 (although not from personal experience yet) - <a href="http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/content/view/30925/96/">Small Net Builder</a> did a review on the device and it considers the Netgear to be amongst the best consumer dual-band N routers at the moment.</p><p>I am not sure but I thought the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linksys_routers">WRT300N and WRT350N</a> were single-band N routers that operate on the 2,4 GHz band only, so... It&#039;s a bit like comparing apples and oranges I&#039;d say.</p><p>The thing is OpenWrt&#039;s web interface is commercial grade from 8.09 on (at least to me) whereas 7.09 has a lot of loose ends (probably also because that interface was an external project, X-Wrt). Encryption is easy to set on 8.09 but on 7.09 the GUI can crap out on you if you use e.g. a WPA key with some special chars. Once you know where to look you&#039;ll find it easier to edit the configuration file for wireless encryption than go through the web interface for it (at least in 7.09).</p>									</div>
