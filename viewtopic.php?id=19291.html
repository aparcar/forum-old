					<p>Hello - </p><p>I&#039;ve been racking my brain on this all weekend and have finally decided it&#039;s time to seek external help before I pull the last of my hair out. ;)</p><p>My OpenWrt install is on a Meraki MR3201A and my Wifi Router is a linksys running unencrypted.</p><p>Using 8.09, I can connect as a client to the linksys (and several other open access points I have running here). My OpenWRT client is assgned the IP of 192.168.2.103 and I can ping the gateway (192.168.2.1). However, I can&#039;t seem to get beyond the gateway. For instance, ping <a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a> just hangs on OpenWrt. </p><p>This is all very strange b/c it worked fine on Kamikaze V7.</p><p>Here&#039;s what I&#039;ve changed the config files to:<br />/etc/config/network:</p><p> config &#039;interface&#039; &#039;loopback&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ifname&#039; &#039;lo&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ipaddr&#039; &#039;127.0.0.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;netmask&#039; &#039;255.0.0.0&#039;</p><p> config &#039;interface&#039; &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ifname&#039; &#039;eth0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;type&#039; &#039;bridge&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;netmask&#039; &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ipaddr&#039; &#039;192.168.100.1&#039;</p><p> config &#039;interface&#039; &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ifname&#039; &#039;ath0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;dhcp&#039;</p><br /><p>/etc/config/wireless:<br /> config &#039;wifi-device&#039; &#039;wifi0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;type&#039; &#039;atheros&#039;</p><p> config &#039;wifi-iface&#039; &#039;cfg2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;device&#039; &#039;wifi0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;mode&#039; &#039;sta&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; option &#039;ssid&#039; &#039;05B402188120&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; option &#039;encryption&#039; &#039;none&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; option &#039;key&#039; &#039;&#039;</p><p>I&#039;ve even loaded Gargoyle and LUCI ont fresh OpenWRT installs on separate MR3201As to configure the devices to read the config files to see if mine were different, but no luck. Those two GUIs also perform the same way - can&#039;t get past the gateway router.</p><p>The really strange thing is that for a very short time, it was working OK. Any ideas on what to try next? the open wifi router/gateway is easily connected to via PC. I&#039;ve probably been staring at this way too long and am missing something minor, eh? </p><p>Harry</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hschechter</strong> on 9 Mar 2009, 21:59)</p>

					<p>Thank you! I&#039;m new to OpenWRT, but hopefully will learn enough to help others here soon. I appreciate you taking the time to respond.</p>									</div>
