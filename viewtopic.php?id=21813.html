					<p>Greetings to everyone! I&#039;m getting desperate, so any help would be truly appreciated... Here&#039;s my situation:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Internet -&gt; Router #1 (not OpenWRT-based) -&gt; WL500gP</code></pre></div><p>I would love to get this setup working. Router #1 was provided by ISP and cannot be moved or removed from the &#039;scheme&#039; (has to remain as &#039;primary&#039; internet router). I very much like WL500gP and managed to set up stuff that can&#039;t move over to Router #1 (USB HDD and stuff like samba, mediaserver, torrent client). Having said that, I&#039;m looking into how to set up WL500gP so the overall combination works.</p><p>I understand I may need to do some port forwarding on Router #1 and that should not be a problem. What I&#039;m not sure about is how to set up both WAN and LAN side of WL500gP IP-wise; it doesn&#039;t matter if WAN will be set up as static or DHCP-provided.</p><p>LAN setup of Router #1 is 192.168.1.1/24, with running DHCP server assigning addresses from range 192.168.1.10-192.168.1.29. I&#039;ve googled quite a bit, and tried multiple ways of setting things up, but never got WL500gP to get through to the Internet; attempts usually ended up with a need to boot WL500gP into failsafe, restore network settings to something usual and start over. Some posts I&#039;ve found suggested I don&#039;t use WAN port of WL500gP at all, but I wasn&#039;t sure if that&#039;s the right way to go - I don&#039;t mind as long as I can get a working connection b/w WL500gP and Internet.</p><p>Can anyone help please? Thanks a bunch...</p><p>M.</p>									</div>

					<p>Are Router #1 and WL500gP connected with a cable?</p><p>Edit:<br />I assume they are.</p><p>Try the following:</p><p>- revert the configuration to defaults<br />- attach one of the lan ports of router #1 to one of the *lan* ports of wl500gp<br />- assign a fixed ip from the 192.168.1.0/24 range to the wl500gp lan (maybe outside of the dhcp range, like 192.168.1.200 or so)<br />- set the gateway to the router #1 lan ip on the wl500gp lan<br />- disable dhcp on the wl500gp by removing all interface sections in the dhcp configuration<br />- set the forward policy to ACCEPT on lan in the wl500gp firewall configuration (or disable the firewall entirely, not really needed)<br />- optionally resolve the wan port on the wl500gp by removing the wan interface section from the network config and put the port into the lan vlan</p><p>This way the WL500GP will act as a managed switch with wireless bridged to it.<br />- DHCP remains on router #1<br />- Wlan clients on WL500GP are forwarded to Router #1<br />- All five ethernet ports on the WL500GP are usable as LAN</p><p>HTH,<br />JoW</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jow</strong> on 16 Sep 2009, 15:35)</p>

					<p>Shucks, I meant to mention that in the original post <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> This is v1, running on 2.6 kernel with Broadcomm replaced by Atheros. The intent is to connect the two via ethernet cable. I don&#039;t need to use WAN on WL500gP as additional LAN port - can&#039;t tell whether it&#039;s easier (or even possible) to connect the two routers by merely using LAN-LAN ports (I obviously have to use LAN port on Router #1 side).</p>									</div>
