					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am currently (trying) to chance the software on various Linksys routers from DD-WRT to OpenWrt.</p><p>I have a WRT54GS and a WRT54GL, both with White Russian and X-Wrt installed, a third router is acting as access router for my home network.</p><p>When I try to use one of the WRTs with OpenWrt as access routers they cannot access the internet. Installing OpenWrt itself was not a problem before that, because they were &quot;behind&quot; the current access router. Now, after changing &quot;roles&quot; they cannot access the internet.</p><p>I have got no idea what the problem may be.</p><p>Can anyone give me a hint/help?</p><p>Kind regards,<br />Jörn.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok.</p><p>Back to start.</p><p>On a WRT54GS I installed White Russion 0.9 (again).</p><p>I configured the WAN settings with my provider&#039;s account details. The OpenWrt router cannot gain access to the internet. For example, invoking the update of the software package list results in wget complaining &quot;host not found&quot;.</p><p>I changed the WAN setting of the OpenWrt router to connection type &quot;none&quot; and placed the OpenWrt router behind my current DD-WRT access router (nice to have a &quot;backup&quot; router).</p><p>Now the OpenWrt box can gain access via the DD-WRT one, I can update/install software on the OpenWrt box.</p><p>I cannot image why the OpenWrt box cannot connect to the internet when used as the access router. For me the settings for default gateway, dhcp and dns seem to be OK.</p><p>Something is somewhere wrong. Can you please help me? Thank you.</p><p>Kind regards,<br />Jörn.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi again,</p><p>Problem solved after a POWER DOWN and restart of my PC.</p><p>Up to that point I only made a ipconfig /release and ipconfig /renew on the command line of my PC (Windows XP) or a reboot whilst playing around with the OpenWrt boxes. Obviously, the router with OpenWrt was not satisfied with just ipconfig or a simple reboot.</p><p>This is a behaviour which the routers did never show whilst running the original Linksys SW or DD-WRT. Took quite a while to track this down.</p><p>So, a power down and restart makes my day.</p><p>Regards,<br />Jörn.</p>									</div>
