					<p>Hi there, having got an office-supplied WRTP54G and ISP-supplied Zyxel P-660HW-D1, I find myself in utter disgust of poor UI quality (WRTP54G) and perplexed at seemingly simple software bugs (P-660HW-D1), and in both cases sheer sadness that I can&#039;t just SSH in and fix the problem myself.</p><p>So my goals are:<br />&nbsp; - Router with a good wireless chipset (it only needs to work with an iMac and MacBook; this shouldn&#039;t be hard but at least the Zyxel can&#039;t talk WPA to the iMac)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- Enough memory to upload random scripts / binaries that I might want to run on the router.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- Built-in DSL modem.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- Excellent support for OpenWRT, such that I can assume random bugs/problems are most likely configuration errors and not flaky software</p><p>Is such a nirvana possible? :-)</p><p>If so, what&#039;s the best router to buy in order to get stable OpenWRT that supports wlan + dsl? I suppose my biggest priority is plenty of room in the flash.</p><p>Thoughts?</p><br /><p>David.</p>									</div>

					<p>I might add that I&#039;m not tied solely to OpenWRT: if there is a better Linux-for-small-routers available I&#039;d take it, as long as the recommended device was known to work well with whatever that may be. I just want netfilter / iproute2 / etc. etc. to play with myself.</p>									</div>

					<p>I like WRTSL54GS a lot, others like the Asus premium products.&nbsp; 8 megs flash, 32 megs RAM is enough to do most tasks.&nbsp; I run a timeserver and some other little things on mine.&nbsp; Uptime is quite good, easy to debug.&nbsp; I send syslog output to another system so I have all logs to read when there is any problem.</p><p>I would like actually to play with bigger system like Soekris or Wrap2 board. See the Hardware listing in the Wiki.&nbsp; Unfortunately difficult to find a router with that little bit more oomph and space that I would like.&nbsp; Everything in computer world gets more RAM with each generation EXCEPT for routers which seem to reach it&#039;s plateau in feature-set when the WRT54GS v1.0 came out.&nbsp; If anything move has been to cut hardware capabilities to minimum to save on costs but sell for same price, since market does not seem to want a Premium SOHO Router.</p><p>Next option seems to be old PC and load SmoothWall distro or similar.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 6 Jun 2007, 03:40)</p>
