Now when I edit the above file and remove the comment before the &#039;type bridge&#039; and restart the network, suddenly all works as it should (now the main interface is br-wan with the correct ip, etc...)<br />The interesting thing is that when I leave it like this and reboot, the same trouble happens - connections just time out. After I edit the config/network file and comment out the bridge line again, and restart the network, everything works as it should again.</p><p>Where could be the problem? Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>I think the problem is in the firewall configuration... by default I think it drops all traffic on the wan network.</p><p>You might also want to turn off masquerading, since they both look to be internal IP addresses. To do this, take out the &quot;option masq 1&quot; in the firewall config.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well I&#039;m almost sure that&#039;s not it, since what I tried is completely disable firewall (/etc/init.d/firewall disable), reboot, and the problem remains exactly the same. I checked and there were no iptables rules loaded after reboot.</p>									</div>

					<p>I also found out that when I edit the network config file back to the setting that was there on boot, the network again won&#039;t work. This is true regardless whether on boot the bridge option is commented out on boot or not.</p>									</div>

					<p>I came across a similar problem and added the following line to /etc/firewall.user</p><p>iptables -I INPUT -j ACCEPT</p><p>That jumps an ACCEPT in front of everything else that iptables inserts.&nbsp; It&#039;s kind of brute force and I&#039;d like to modify the actual iptable rule that creates the block in the first place, but I can do that later.</p><p>I know you said you disabled your firewall rules... but I thought I&#039;d mention my fix anyway.</p>									</div>
