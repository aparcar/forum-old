					<p>Thanks for replies. </p><p>I will contact the pandorabox dev. </p><p>Ofc. I was thinking about openwrt / lede. But i need&nbsp; ip bandwidth limiter on my system and OpenWRT can&#039;t do this amd if i am not wrong, the Lede is the same. That is why i am still on pandora. </p><p>On this realese ia everything stable, without problems. So mybe is there any another system which know IP bandwidth limit? Byee</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, you are trying to install the ancient wshaper that has already been deleted from the Openwrt/LEDE master package repo due to being deprecated. </p><p>wshaper was cool maybe 10 years ago. But it is not ok any more.<br /><a href="https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/bloat/wiki/Wondershaper_Must_Die/">https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/bl … _Must_Die/</a></p><p>It was succeeded by qos-scripts, and that has also been superseded by sqm-scripts (and luci-app-sqm).</p><p>If you need bandwidth shaper, use SQM with a current LEDE or Openwrt build.<br />SQM is the current de-facto standard bandwidth shaper.</p>									</div>
