					<p>Hi guys:</p><p>I have an old Belkin F6D4230-4 v1 (which has CPU Ralink RT3050, a flash size of 2 MiB and RAM size of 8 MiB, as far as I understand) which I used back when my ISP provided Ethernet only modems.<br />Afterwards, the ISP provided a WiFi capable modem (which is a Fiberhome HG110 as far as I could find as it has no data on it at all), which I kept when I switched to another ISP, but I couldn&#039;t find any CPU or RAM info on it.<br />What I would like to do is to use either as a WiFi extender (bridge) as my current WiFi modem doesn&#039;t reach certain parts of the house. I don&#039;t care about any other features such as VPN, DHCP, ADSL, etc. Is there any way I could use Open WRT for either of these? Regarding the FiberHome modem, how can I find out CPU / RAM / flash info on it (in case it&#039;s relevant)?</p>									</div>

					<p>I could be wrong, but I thing that the specs on both of them are way too low to run anything useful on them...</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the prompt response. I have searched and noticed there are several routers that look pretty similar to the one I have. How can I tell which brand and model is it? BTW, the ISP removed the labels from the bottoms for some reason.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi guys:</p><p>Regarding the Belkin F6D4230-4 v1 (which has CPU Ralink RT3050, a flash size of 2 MiB and RAM size of 8 MiB), I noticed that the firmwares available on the site are 3 MiB, so I was wondering. Could I build a &quot;bare bones&quot; open WRT so that it fits on the 2 MiB flash? I mean, I only need the router to receive the WiFi signal (WPA2) and repeat it on another channel, leaving the main router to do all the DHCP, DNS, etc. I can even give it a static IP so as to avoid extra code and get rid of MAC filtering, etc and configure it via command line to get rid of Luci. Ethenet connectivity would be great if possible but not needed. If repeating WiFi is too resource consuming, I could use it the other way around, just Ethernet connectivity would do it. Which packages should / could I leave it out?</p>									</div>
