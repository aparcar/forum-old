					<p>I noticed that trying to use the work &quot; u h t t p d &quot; without spaces causes the post to fail SPAM check as it is detected as a link (which it is not).</p><p>this word is commonly used to reference the LuCl service name in OpenWRT which really is a bummer <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Please see if you can tweak your link detection Regex (or send me what you have and I&#039;ll gladly fix it for you).</p><p>Best wishes,</p><p>newgeo</p>									</div>

					<p>This restriction will go away when you post more often.<br />Compared to the previous state where everybody was allowed to post links right from post #1, we now have practically zero spam im this forum, which I really appreciate.</p>									</div>
