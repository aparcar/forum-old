					<p>Can someone help me with local SAMBA network?<br />I set up 2 routers, wrt3200acm running openwrt as main router, and the other running Tomato as AP which also support SAMBA client and attach to a storage.

The FCC has mandated all new routers with 5Ghz, not allow the customer to adjust the power levels at all. The power levels are set by chip programmed by Linksys from the factory and can not be altered. So, I&#039;m assuming you live here in the US? It&#039;s too bad, but with Opensource we had some people screwing with the power levels and taking them out of range for the particular band they were on likely causing interference or the perception of interference in their area&#039;s. When it comes to frequencies, the FCC doesn&#039;t mess around and shut it down. Anyhow, that&#039;s water under the bridge at this point.</p><p>So about the wifi drops.. Is this happening because the signal is too low or the distance too great due to the lower power level?&nbsp; Or is the signal good, and you might be watching a video and wifi just drops on the device?</p></blockquote></div><p>Nope, I&#039;m from spain, it&#039;s nearly 2 o&#039;clock in the morning here right now. 2.4 ghz wireless drops with no device attached at all. I test it using an app, wifi analyzer for instance, and see how signal drops constantly. maybe some kind of interferences or maybe not. Regarding 5 ghz wireless I&#039;ll try not to configurise manually power levels and will see how signal behaves. when you mention power levels you mean to adjust Network / Wireless / transmit power right?</p><p>I am also aware about some 5 ghz channels restrictions not to overlap with radar signal for instance.
