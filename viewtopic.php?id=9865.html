					<p>I a interested in getting SD storage onto the Merakis, something similar to the WRT54G hack:</p><p><a href="http://kiel.kool.dk">http://kiel.kool.dk</a>/</p><p>I found some info about the GPIOs:</p><p><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=8852">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=8852</a></p><p>but I was wondering if anyone had additional info about what each GPIO is currentlyused for, and which ones to not mess with.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>you can install OpenWRT on the device as found at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Meraki/Mini">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har … eraki/Mini</a><br />and you can download the GPIO program which you can compile it against the version of OpenWRT you installed. And I would imagine you could search for the GPIOs your self and port the sd card driver thats floating about, again im no developer but sounds possible to me <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p><p>and Ill be trying this myself when I get OpenWRT on my meraki device.</p><br /><p>Cheers<br />Rip</p>									</div>

					<p>I have compiled and install the meraki openwrt.&nbsp; I have also added the gpio_proc kernel mod.&nbsp; The GPIOs 0-7 are straight across JP2.&nbsp; The square keyed pad is GPIO0.&nbsp; GPIO3 is definitely used for the LED, the others seems to be free, although 5 may be used for reset (I will have to confirm that).</p><p>My plan is to write a small &quot;bit-banging&quot; SPI driver for the Meraki, ala: Linux/drivers/spi/spi_s3c24xx.c in the kernel (easy, I think).</p><p>Then add the development MMC-SPI driver: <a href="http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/28/110">http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/28/110</a>&nbsp; which supposedly works with bitbanging SPI drivers already.</p><p>I will have to backport both to 2.6.16.</p><p>We shall see if this works...</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m looking to create a general purpose bit-banging SPI interface myself, to communicate with an FPGA I/O extender. The actual bit-banging isn&#039;t that hard - look in the GPIO MMC drivers for example code.</p><p>What I would like to do is support multiple SPI devices with one interface. (since there are only a handful of GPIO available)</p><p>It would be nice if I could get both MMC storage AND a FPGA I/O extender on the same bus. Unfortunately, I&#039;m not terribly familiar with kernel module development.</p><p>My end goal is to be able to create /dev/ttyS0x and /dev/gpio0x interfaces, where the underlying driver sends data to the FPGA via SPI.</p>									</div>

					<p>gpio 5 is indeed used for reset, best not to play with it (except to reset the device), and 3 is of course the led. I believe all the others are usable (including the led, if you don&#039;t care about the normal function, I suppose), by virtue of not breaking anything from twiddling with them, and proper behavior observed for I/O using a multimeter</p><p>that new mmc-spi driver looks very interesting, definitely going to look at that</p><p>you should not have to backport to 2.6.16.16, openwrt uses 2.6.19.2 (or maybe 20 now) for the atheros port, and in any case I have tested 2.6.20 as bootable. had some problems with madwifi in 20 that might be fixed by now.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Kevin</strong> on 15 Mar 2007, 20:02)</p>

					<p>Some other potentially good links. Seems like the mmc layer is independent of the spi implementation.
