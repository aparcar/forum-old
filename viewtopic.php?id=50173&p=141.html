Or we are simply at Marvell&#039;s mercy to provide some information on the next release?</p><p>It would have been a cool idea if Linksys had released this router with both the stock and openwrt installed (fully worked out and no kinks) on the two flash memories and letting users switch. They do give the ability to &quot;restore previous version&quot; from the stock firmware GUI.</p><p>Buffalo has a router that comes with DD-wrt as stock FW.</p></blockquote></div><p>FYI:<br />(Before opting for the WRT1900ac) I tried the Buffalo. It went back to the retailer after 24 hours. The branded DD-WRT FW on board is Buffalo&#039;s own (stunted) version. Many of the settings found in the original builds are absent and Buffalo will not honour its warranty if an original build is installed.</p>									</div>

					<p>Can anyone confirm that wifi transmit power does actually change (r44455). Interface reports that Tx power has been changed but there is no signal level change, between 0 to 20 dBm, on the client side.</p><p>Another issue is that disabling the wifi radio with&nbsp; &#039;uci set wireless.@wifi-device[0].disabled=1; uci commit wireless; wifi down radio0&#039;, doesn&#039;t stop radio from broadcasting.

It seems that you are very close to success though. If you want to you can look at the contents of the opkg.conf file with a single command. This assumes that you are using putty to run the openwrt busybox command processor. Just type cat /etc/opkg.conf and you will see the file contents on your screen. Just look for any lines starting with #. They are the &quot;commented out lines&quot;. If you notice the line that contains &#039;luci&#039; has a # at the start then it will not download&nbsp; luci until you remove the # and maybe the left spaces too. If you need to use the built in editor vi we can help. I use winscp to edit the file with a easy editor but vi works too.</p><p>Charlie</p>									</div>
