					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;ve seen that EA6100 from &quot;Techdata&quot; says that its possible to support however I couldn&#039;t find any specific link to download its squashfs-factory.bin.</p><p>E1700, EA6100 and TP-Link C20i have similar hardware identities i.e. CPU, LAN, WLAN chips, etc. Would it be possible to use openwrt factory bin file for E1700 or TP-Link C20i then install it into EA6100? I was hoping to get a custom working openwrt firmware or some directions how to create openwrt fw specific for EA6100.</p><p>I bought a new EA6100 and I&#039;m very much interested and eager to install openwrt Chaos Calmer firmware on it. Any suggestions? Please help. Thanks.</p>									</div>
