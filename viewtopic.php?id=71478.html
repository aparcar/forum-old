					<p>I am planning on getting an OepnWRT router that has a SIM card slot.&nbsp; The plan is to run a mobile carriar sim car inthis router.&nbsp; The problem is the SIM card has very limited data per month: 3GB.</p><p>So it would be nice if there was a feature to set a down/up quota limit per month and once it reaches then all data (in/out) is blocked.</p><p>Does OpenWRT have a GUI-like feature that does this?&nbsp; I notice Gargoyle. DD-WRT have this but cant find anything for openWRT.</p><p>If it does not then, because i lack all Linux level knowledge,&nbsp; can you walk me through like i am 5 years old on how i can make this possible? Ideally, the solution should have a GUI interface to make modifying and visually current usage possible.</p><p>Surely something like this exists since the feature seems obvious to have for a full featured router software, even when not using SIM cards.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the reply @tapper.&nbsp; Sadly from the very small list of supported routers by Gargoyle i don&#039;t see the one router i am thinking about getting.&nbsp; It&#039;s called the ZBT-WE826-T.</p><p>The router i would want needs to have a SIM slot so i can use a wireless carrier&#039;s data plan.&nbsp; So i am open to more than the ZBT-WE826-T.&nbsp; All the routers that Gargoyle supports are just routers with no SIM support, unfortunately.</p>									</div>

					<p>NO, NO. It is _NOT_ a router function. You will need to set it up yourself. This is, what I did on ZBT-826 (plastic case).</p>									</div>
