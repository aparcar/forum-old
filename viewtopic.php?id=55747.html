					<p>Short answer: If you&#039;re getting your equipment now with the plan to have it run OpenWrt, don&#039;t go for a modem/router combination. Even if some very select integrated (mostly Lantiq-based) devices are supported by OpenWrt, they are still the exception and oftentimes very outdated hardware -- for example, the DGN3500 you mention doesn&#039;t even have 5 GHz wifi, and its 2.4 GHz is quite limited (I speak from experience).</p><p>My advice would be: Get a somewhat modern router supported by OpenWrt, something that fits your requirements and your budget. You can get a lot of routers that offer quite a lot more than a DGN3500 <a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=my+net+n750">for much less money, second hand</a>. And then get a separate modem for a few bucks on ebay.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 13 Feb 2015, 20:48)</p>

Lantiq based devices do seem to be the way to go, but there aren&#039;t that many readily available devices. TP-Link has the TP-WD8970, but flashing it seems tricky.</p>									</div>

I think I&#039;ll give the DGN3500 a try. They have a horrible all-in-one Westell 802.11g modem/router/AP from about 10 years ago that reboots/crashes semi-regularly. They will never touch the admin interface or directly use any specific feature, so a stable and reliable device is really the most important criteria. Stock firmware might be worth a shot, but making the slow connection more usable with fq_codel is enough for me to consider OpenWrt *IF* it still meets the reliability/stability criteria with this particular device.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drawz</strong> on 14 Jul 2015, 05:08)</p>
