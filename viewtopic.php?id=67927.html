Alot of my customers are asking for a public wifi, because of security reasons I can&#039;t give them access to my private network.</p><p>What I want is setup one wifi which has a pass-through to the wired network, so DHCP and such is done by the main router.</p><p>Also a second wifi network which only has internet access and is seperated from the rest of my private network.</p><p>How woudl I achieve this?</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, howto todo the DHCP passthrough while isolating the other network via a vlan... can&#039;t seem to get that to work somehow, eventhough I&#039;ve looked at the wiki, which doesn&#039;t accomplish what I want.</p>									</div>

					<p>If the OpenWrt is configured as a &quot;dumb AP&quot; (<a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap</a>), then you have all you need for the &quot;Private WiFi&quot; to work (&quot;DHCP passthrough&quot; just works because LAN and WAN are bridged together). Then you add the &quot;Guest WiFi&quot; (which will be isolated and require a DHCP server on the OpenWrt device, as per the instructions on the guide), and you do not need a VLAN at all.</p>									</div>

					<p>I suggest you to leave your private network router as it is.<br />First you need openwrt router secure it with a password and go to wifi tab and scan networks and connect to your wifi network and then it will ask you for the password and then click connect and then you will have internet access, also change your router ip to 10.0.0.1<br />Simple and easy</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MikeZak</strong> on 7 Oct 2016, 19:38)</p>

					<p>Set up vlans with each wifi network on its own vlan and with its own SSID.</p><p>Then you can firewall each vlan from the others and set up dnsmasq to hand out DHCP addresses on each vlan from a different subnet.</p>									</div>
