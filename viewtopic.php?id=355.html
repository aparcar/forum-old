					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m looking for a cheap solution for building quite big (currently 50-100 users) wireless network for providing Internet access.</p><p>I don&#039;t want to use simple WDS bridges because of performance reasons. It seems that a mesh network would be best for me. I&#039;ve googled a bit for mesh network routers, and found some products, but I&#039;m interested in the Meshcube the most. The only reason I haven&#039;t already bought it is the price <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p><p>I would like to deploy &quot;Scenario 2&quot; described on Meshcube wiki (<a href="http://www.meshcube.org/meshwiki/HowTo_2fInstallationScenarios">http://www.meshcube.org/meshwiki/HowTo_ â€¦ nScenarios</a>) - one WiFi interface &quot;works&quot; as a mesh router and other as a standard 802.11b AP. So here is my question: can Linksys WRT54G with OpenWRT and required packages installed be used as described above? Does anybody use such network? Or maybe anybody succeeded in installing Meshcube&#039;s software on WRT54G? Any other ideas for creating a city-wide wireless network?</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>

					<p>It seems to me that a cheap solution to the two-radio problem would be to buy two WRT54Gs (at $54.00 each, not a bad investment.&nbsp; See pricegrabber.com), or one WRT54G and one WET-11.&nbsp; Use a little creative coding to set one wifi radio in AP mode, and put the other one in bridge mode, using it just for it&#039;s radio, as the mesh radio.&nbsp; Then make the one running in AP more do all the computational heavy lifting.</p><p>It would probably work best using a WET-11 hooked to the WAN port of a WRT54, and using that as the mesh radio, and then using the built-in radio in the WRT54 as your AP.&nbsp; The WET-11 works as a layer 2 bridge out of the box.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve got a little more cash, use Senao CB3+ bridges instead of WET-11s.&nbsp; They&#039;re more reliable and do 200mw out.</p><p>So, you&#039;d wind up with a WRT54g with 4 lan ports and an AP bridged together in a local network, plus a wireless bridge connected to the WAN port, with the WRT54G acting as the mesh router brains.&nbsp; Should take about $120-$130/node and a few hours to set up.&nbsp; The bonus is that you could seperate the mesh radio from the router by up to 100m of ethernet cable.&nbsp; So you can put the AP in the basement, and the wireless bridge doing the meshing in the attic, power the bridge with POE, and have a great little setup.&nbsp; For the cost of one &quot;professional-grade&quot; meshcube, you could have a two-node system.&nbsp; With the sacrifice of a few brain cells, you could VLAN off one of the LAN ports on one of the WRT54Gs and connect it to your broadband connection (cable, dsl, ete) and have a gateway node for your mesh network.</p><p>Just a thought.<br />John Gorkos</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;d rather use WRT54G as the mesh router - I want to fully control my backbone (ad-hoc mesh network). Such setup would also be more flexible - I can choose of many APs to connect to the router, or even use ethernet switches on some (cable-only) installations. What is more, WET-11s (about 130$) are more expensive than WRT-54Gs (about 100$) in Poland <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p><p>However, thanks for a suggestion. I&#039;m still thinking about 802.11 mesh networks scalability. Anybody tested it?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello, ab0oo and pjf:</p><p>Are you still working on the mesh thing and interested in this topic?</p><p>From ab0oo&#039;s post, it seems that all the routers are within the same domain, I mean, with the same SSID and ip range. Is that true for the 70-node mesh networks? Is that possible for your solution that each router annouces its own SSID?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Louie</p>									</div>
