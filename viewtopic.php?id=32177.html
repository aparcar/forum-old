					<p>A reverse phone lookup would be handy if behavior and activity of your husband have become suspicious. You are suspecting that your husband might be cheating you, calling someone else. Alternatively, someone else is calling your husband. However, you have no evidence. You want to be sure if your husband having an affair. You want to deal the situation upfront and you want to rest in peace. All you need now is the concrete evidence, whatever the truth is.</p><p>Scenario: 2</p><p>You can trace your husband with a reverse cell if your husband has to travel frequently for business, and you want to find out where your husband is calling from, whose phone there: from, and even helpful information about where that comes from. You want to know to satisfy your curiosity and to have the sense of security out of the relation.</p><p>Scenario: 3</p><p>A reverse lookup could help you when your phone just rang, and you don&#039;t recognize the number that shows up on your caller ID. Generally you don&#039;t attain these calls. However, these types of calls surely make you curious. You want to know the identity and the purpose of the caller for various reasons. It could be simple curiosity, or the desire to protect your privacy. You may want to be dead sure that the caller had no harmful intention by any means. All that you want to do without calling back.</p><p>Scenario: 4</p><p>A reverse cell lookup would be handy if someone frequently calling you at 3 o&#039;clock in the morning to ask you the time! The caller is hanging up the phone without talking. Someone calling you rapidly and you want to stop these unwanted calls or need to know about any phone number regardless it is a cell or land line number. You have decided to block that number to protect your privacy. However, you want to know the identity of the caller before you do that.</p><p>Scenario: 5</p><p>You can identify with a reverse phone lookup if someone handed you a phone message with no name and only a phone number. It became important that you know the identity before you call but the person handed you the number is currently out of contact.</p><p>Scenario: 6</p><p>You can track down with a reverse phone lookup, someone you loved long time ago and want to contact him or her. Even you may want to locate an old classmate or friend you liked very much.</p><p>Scenario: 7</p><p>Your kid is grown up to an age where a close surveillance has become important, and you can do it with a reverse cell phone lookup. There is news of a kid violence and gang atrocities all over the media. You want to monitor your kid activity, who he/she is calling! With whom he/she is going out? You want to take a precaution so that sky doesn&#039;t fall in your head suddenly.</p><p>Scenario: 8</p><p>Activity of one of your employees has become suspicious. You may want to track the activity and movement of your employee and want to know who he/she calling. A reverse phone lookup could help you to achieve that you are looking.</p><p>These are the scenarios when you can be benefited from a reverse phone look-up service. A reverse phone look-up service can bail you out of the situation you are in.</p><p>2. Free reverse phone lookup and Paid reverse phone lookup- Advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>If you want to trace the owner by phone number using reverse cell lookup, there are two options for you, free reverse phone lookup sites and paid reverse phone lookup sites. However, you will face many limitations in case of reverse phone lookup free options. You can use white pages and phone book offline or online. But you cannot find any cell numbers there. Identity of a cell number cannot be achieved for free- it is a restriction enforced by the law.</p><p>You will find many website claims to give you free reverse cell phone look-up. I tried almost all of them and came to a conclusion that those have no ability to assist you in case of scenario we discussed above. However, I want to describe in brief, my experience and observation. I noticed while I tried to use those free services.</p><p>-Most of the time those free reverse phone lookup sites appeared to be just gimmicks, either gave me false information or ended up being a scamming or phishing site.</p><p>-Most of my search outcomes with free reverse phone were: we have no data regarding your search, please insert another number!</p><p>-Most reverse lookup free sites, eventually lead me to a site where I ended up paying for the service anyway.</p>									</div>
