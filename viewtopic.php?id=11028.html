					<p>I am not sure this is even possible. What I am wanting to do is configure my wrt54gs v3 like the following:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;WAN&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Port 4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Port 1-3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; <br /> Port 0 5--|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | ---Port 0 4 5&nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|-----------|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; vlan1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; vlan2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; vlan0</p><br /><p>Basically I need the WAN port and port 4 to be bridged and allow vlan1 to still exist and be the primary network interface. I then am going to attach an external switch to port 4 and connect something like a dmz. I need to have 2 addresses that are not natted on port 4. </p><p>My biggest goal is to be able to use qos inside of the router, I have an Asterix PBX I am setting up on the unattted addresses and need to control what is allocated to the rest of the network based on its use. Using natted address for sip makes it impossible to have more than one PBX server running and other issues. Plus one other problem I have is I need to use DHCP to get these address.</p><p>So far my experience leads me to believe that when I create the linked ports 0 4 5 on vlan2, the switch drops port 0 on vlan1 and leaves only port 5.</p><p>If there are any better suggestions or ideas as to be able to do this please let me know.</p><p>Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pshempel</strong> on 5 Jun 2007, 21:08)</p>

Only problem is that ebtables is not usable so I had to configure firewall rules on the host. None of the modules for the kernel are available and the ebtables libs are not being found. I had to symlink them into /usr/lib being that I am not sure how to tell ld.so to find them without ld.so.conf.</p><p>Also physdev is not available in a standard build of 2.4 it looks like from first glance. I could use that instead of ebtables to handle most of my configuration if it existed.<br />I am buying a platform (WGT634U) soon that will support 2.6 kernels and replace this router with it. </p><p>So far it seems that qos is functioning as expected. I use shorewall to manage the firewall and qos rules (Not the one in kamikaze packages, that one in broken), and it seems even without physdev I have qos working.</p><br /><p>Thanks again for the help.</p><p>Philip</p>									</div>
