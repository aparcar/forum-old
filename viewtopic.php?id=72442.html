					<p>Hi,</p><p>since the wifi range of my main router (Speedport W724, dhcp+gw) is not sufficient i want to build a network bridge (TL-WR841N and OpenWRT 15.05). Furthermore i want to attach a FreeNas Server to the switch of the TL-841N, which should be visible to all all devices in the network. Both the Speedport (LAN) and the TL Router (WAN) are connected via ethernet.</p><p>For this i followed the dumb ap and the bridged ap howto. WiFi is working and the clients get dhcp leases from the main router, Wifi Roaming is working.</p><p>The problem is, that i can&#039;t connect to the FreeNAS Server (static IP 192.168.2.10). I&#039;m not sure, how to bridge the Switch with the WAN/Wifi Interface exactly. I tried to change the IP of br-lan to 192.168.2.3, but then I can&#039;t access UCI/LUCI anymore. </p><p>My /etc/config/network looks like: </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;lan&#039;

					<p>I do sort of the same thing, but I found it is much easier to install luci-proto-relay (which will install relayd)&nbsp; I think adding that then adding an interface of proto relay-bridge and bridge the lan and the wan (im assuming that is where the connection to the other router is) should do it.&nbsp; </p><p>In my config though it uses ifname ethX.1 on the lan bridge but that may be just a difference in hardware on how the cpu/switch/radios are set up between your setup and mine.</p><p>In my case I&#039;m bridging the 5ghz radio as a client to the main router so I don&#039;t need to run the cable but have several devices connected to the switch that all get addresses etc from the main router just fine.&nbsp; My main router uses 192.168.1.0/24</p><p>there are so many different ways to set things up and so many different hardware thats its hard to give correct advice without knowledge/experience on exactly the same stuff.

					<p>A truly dumb AP, which is what you want, does not have a WAN network at all.&nbsp; Everything in br-lan.&nbsp; This will allow free flow of traffic bridged at layer 2 without any further configuration.&nbsp; You can move the eth0 port to LAN so there are 5 usable ports on the AP.&nbsp; One of which, it doesn&#039;t matter which one, goes to your main router.</p><p>Make sure to turn off the AP&#039;s DHCP server both IPv4 and v6.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 29 Oct 2017, 19:41)</p>

					<p>Because your main router and sub router connected with Ethernet cable, you don&#039;t need relayd. Refer bridged ap in <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/bridgedap">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/bridgedap</a></p>									</div>
