					<p>Hi there,<br />I red a little about the ath9k driver and stumbled upon the fact, that there are limits for transmission power.<br />First, there are limits given by the regdomain and second there are limits given by the regdb.txt.<br />The limits from the regdb.txt are a little conservative, at least for DE and 5GHz. Setting ATH_USER_REGD=y at least gives one the oppertunity to set tx power for ch 40 to 100mW. According to the regulation for DE and the comments in the <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/package/mac80211/files/regdb.txt">regdb.txt</a> the limit for 5150 - 5250 is set a little conservaitive, as TPC in not required. 3dbm would make a big difference for me. Anyhow, i could patch the db, but that wouldn&#039;t solve my problem, as there is a hardware limit set.<br />In theory DE allows up to 1000mW tx power, while for now DFS is not implemented and therefore the limit is 200mW for channel 36 and 40.<br />I&#039;m using a TP WDR4300 btw, it has that chip.<br />Now the part I&#039;m not shure about and I wasn&#039;t able to find specific information on:<br />Is the AR9500 capable of transmitting 1000mW? The driver, thankfully supported by Atheros, respects the Hardware values. Also TP-Link ships their router with RegDomain US in EEPROM. I assume the EEPROM also holds the data for the &quot;hardware limits&quot;. Following that assumption I suppose I simply could dump the EEPROM, modify the &quot;hardware limit&quot; values and change my RegDomain to DE, recalculate the CRC and flash it back. Obviously I&#039;m not interested in destroing my TX hardware and I would like to follow the approch of using the vanilla ath9k driver.<br />Does anyone know what the &quot;real&quot; hardware limit is (source would be nice), or if this depends on a seperate piece of hardware (HF amplifier)?</p><p>Thank you in advance</p><p>Btw, I&#039;m not really interested in hearing about violating laws (I know them, but I don&#039;t live in the US) and so on. I know what I do, I have equipment to measure the actual output power.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey jow,<br />thanks for the links, I&#039;ll have a look at them.<br />As I mentioned I would be interested in being able to run vanilla drivers, a binary patcher works but I want &quot;perfection&quot;.</p>									</div>
