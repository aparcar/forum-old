					<p>Is there a standard way, if I have a script in /etc/modules.d/, to call it to remove the modules or to add the modules?&nbsp; Is there a special script somewhere that does that?&nbsp; I want to be able to remove, then re-add modules when some changes have occurred.&nbsp; As of now, the best way I can think of is what I&#039;d do with bash (I still need to learn the scripting language for the OpenWRT shell).&nbsp; I&#039;d read in the particular file in /etc/modules.d/ and step through each line and remove the module listed, then step through again and do a modprobe for that module.</p><p>Isn&#039;t there a script or command to do that automatically?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
