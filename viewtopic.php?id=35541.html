					<p>Hello,</p><p>after reading through the wiki pages about QoS, I am now a bit confused. So, the linux kernel has some sort of QoS based on package descriptors built-in, but there are still 3 packages for openWRT doing some sort of additional QoS or Traffic Shaping. Well, I don&#039;t even know what the difference between QoS and Traffic Shaping is, only that Shaping has to do with uploads limiting the downloads because of control packets not being sent fast enough.</p><p>I don&#039;t want to learn how exactly ethernet works right now, just if a QoS-Setup would give me advantages, and if yes, which one I should use.<br />In my setup, there are a bunch of computers connected to the OpenWrt-Router, which provides internet access. Most of the computers are just used to surf the web, but while some are occasionally doing heavy downloads/uploads, a few are also used for gaming or VoIP. Now for gaming/VoIP I want the lowest latency possible while downloads are done in parallel, and I want the uploads to be limited in order to not disturb the downloads too much. If possible, priorizing should not be limited to ports (like the qos-scripts), because they differ a lot.</p><p>Right now I am using wondershaper with its luci-app, but I don&#039;t even know if it works, or where the differences to the qos-dsl package are; so I would be grateful if you could give me some easy explanations <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
