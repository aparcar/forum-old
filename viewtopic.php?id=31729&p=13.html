Look at the grep man pages if you would like more info on how this works (opkg list lists all the packages available and then pipes the output to grep, grep then filters out all the lines without &#039;usb&#039; in them)</p>									</div>

If you can still telnet to failsafe mode, it&#039;s not bricked. in failsafe mode, you can either flash another openwrt firmware or revert back to the stock firmare. To enter failsafe mode, you should hit the reset button immediately after the LED indicator begin to flash. more info on failsafe at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe</a>. now you can use Winscp or any other tools to upload a new firmware to your router and execute &#039;sysupgrade -n firmware-name.bin&#039; to flash the firmware.Good luck to you</p>									</div>

					<p>I have tried to upgrade my wr703 router with openwrt image, as the firmware i have is in chineese. When i enter the adress in the howto below, i eventually get into settings for network connections, i think. No possibillity to load new firmware. I do not get internett acsess on the router, either by using my 3G dongle or by using network cable from my other wireless routers lan port. It seems i have to configure something to do this..</p><p>Anybody have a solution? I only have linux pcs for hand, but still a newbie on linux.. I can maybe borrow a W pc or setting up virtualpc. But do you have a solution to load a firmware to the router by the failsafe method with linux?</p><p>I did not set a static ip adress, but that is only to be on the secure side right?<br />I do get internet on the router if i set it as AP though, but then i am not able to acsess the menues on the router..</p><p>1. Connect your PC to the WR703N and configure it with a static IP of 192.168.1.2<br />2.

					<p>hi.. I am in china and in the hotel we are having a wired connection so I have connected the internet cable to the TL-WR703N router. The hotel has a DHCP type of internet access. when I access the internet from my machine( Say A) it first open the hotel login page I login and now I am able to access the internet, now I connect one more machine (Say B) to this wireless network when I try to access the internet it again asks me the hotel login page. Is there any setting in the router so that when the first machine that gets connected enters the hotel login and password and access the internet and from now onwards any number of machine can&nbsp; access the internet directly that is no need to enter the hotel login in and password. In this example Machine A connects the internet for the first time and enters the user and password, now if machine B connects it can directly access the internet.</p>									</div>

					<p>hi guys, </p><p>I just bought this WR703N and i just wanted to change the language to English and after upgrading the firmware on the wiki page i cant get the wireless radio on. I read few pages back that the wireless radio is turned off. How do i turn on a Windows 7 system, Can someone please guide through this process. </p><p>Secondly i am using TLWR740 wireless router and i would like the 703N to act as a wireless modem during travel either using 3G dongle or using LAN cable. I am just trying to setup the 703 once so i dont need to carry the laptop in the future, is this possible. Every time i try connecting with the 740 wireless i can never get connected to this small router. Not sure what wrong i am doing. It seems both are conflicting each other.</p><p>Anyway at the moment i need to get my wireless router on. Thanks a lot for your help.</p>									</div>
