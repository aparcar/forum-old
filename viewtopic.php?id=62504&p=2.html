To get around this, I would recommend manually flashing the initramfs image to the kernel partition, rebooting the board, deleting the rootfs UBI partition (and all partitions minus board-info, and re-creating caldata again) and then flashing the sysupgrade image. This should re-generate the contents of caldata, as well as setup rootfs and rootfs_data.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi there - thanks for the tutorial to free these devices. I have used this on a Meraki Z1, I get through the root (press S on reboot after changing serial etc) however upon running the w g e t command I always get a Network unreachable response - Things I have checked </p><p>1. I know from looking at my router, (NOT attached to the internet! :-) that the Z1 is being issued a DHCP address but it cannot seem to wget out. <br />2. I have made sure that I can see the h t t p server (python SimpleH T TPServer) from within the same network, (by attaching another machine to the network to look at the same address, yep it downloaded the file!) it&#039;s just the Meraki that cannot see it...</p><p>Any pointers? Has anybody else come across this?</p>									</div>
