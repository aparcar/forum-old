					<p>HI some months ago I was thinking to install Multipath TCP in my Openwrt Chaos Calmer CC <br /> <a href="http://multipath-tcp.org/pmwiki.php/Users/OpenWRT">http://multipath-tcp.org/pmwiki.php/Users/OpenWRT</a></p><p>in the OpenWRT wiki suggest that ROUTER and PC should be patched with multipath tcp in order to use it. however if need to work with only openwrt router&nbsp; it would be possible with one of 2 option....&nbsp; with a proxy or openvpn&nbsp; and the wiki give example with openvpn BUT I would like to install with proxy option instead of openvpn for simplicity.&nbsp; but no info in how to do that</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> Multipath TCP (MPTCP) is an effort towards enabling the simultaneous use of several IP-addresses/interfaces by a modification of TCP that presents a regular TCP interface to applications, while in fact spreading data across several subflows. Benefits of this include better resource utilization, better throughput and smoother reaction to failures.

You have to install the patched kernel on both devices that are involved in a Multipath TCP connection. If these devices are PC&#039;s more info can be found at http://multipath-tcp.org

If your PC and Server have an ordinary TCP-connection, your router cannot use the MPTCP-protocol by default. To make it work, you have two possible solutions:

Use a proxy on the router
Use a VPN to an endpoint with faster network. In this way, you can use all uplinks for all traffic, even trafic to a non-MPTCP-server.</code></pre></div><p>source <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/mptcp">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/mptcp</a></p><p>so it is not enough info or tutorial in this topic..... but hopelly here in the openwrt forum would be answers from people that have installed</p><p>other question is,&nbsp; the instructions said that you should compile and create your own patched firmware based on your device.&nbsp; In my case Buffalo wzr-1750dhp&nbsp; &nbsp;and said that you should have installed in you linux pc the following packages<br />gcc, binutils, bzip2, flex, python, perl, make,<br />find, grep, diff, unzip, gawk, getopt, subversion, libz-dev and libc headers.</p><p>I use linux mint 17.2 32 bits&nbsp; &nbsp;I have now all packages but could not install the following GETOPT, LIBC HEADERS, FIND and DIFF<br />DIFF has one that could be DIFFUTILS not sure..... well I dont know how to install the missing packages. I install also BUILD ESSENTIALS&nbsp; but the packages still missing</p><br /><div class="codebox"><pre><code> This is the buildsystem for the OpenWrt Linux distribution.

Please use &quot;make menuconfig&quot; to configure your appreciated
configuration for the toolchain and firmware.

You need to have installed gcc, binutils, bzip2, flex, python, perl, make,
find, grep, diff, unzip, gawk, getopt, subversion, libz-dev and libc headers.

Run &quot;./scripts/feeds update -a&quot; to get all the latest package definitions
defined in feeds.conf / feeds.conf.default respectively
and &quot;./scripts/feeds install -a&quot; to install symlinks of all of them into
package/feeds/.

Use &quot;make menuconfig&quot; to configure your image.

Simply running &quot;make&quot; will build your firmware.
It will download all sources, build the cross-compile toolchain, 
the kernel and all choosen applications.

You can use &quot;scripts/flashing/flash.sh&quot; for remotely updating your embedded
system via tftp.

The OpenWrt system is documented in docs/. You will need a LaTeX distribution
and the tex4ht package to build the documentation. Type &quot;make -C docs/&quot; to build it.

To build your own firmware you need to have access to a Linux, BSD or MacOSX system
(case-sensitive filesystem required). Cygwin will not be supported because of
the lack of case sensitiveness in the file system.</code></pre></div><p>somewhere I read that compiling a firmware should be in a linux amd64 bits and at least 4 gigas rams instead of linux 32 bits <br />it is really as this ?</p><p>one last question ? it is possible to install MPTCP in a openwrt AA 12.09&nbsp; too ?</p><p>thanks hope you help me to get MPTCP running</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>inquba</strong> on 10 Dec 2015, 18:58)</p>
