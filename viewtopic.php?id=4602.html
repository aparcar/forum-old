					<p>hi there,</p><p>i&#039;d like to streamrip using openwrt myself, so using the openwrt sdk i managed to build a streamripper binary (no ipkg, still need to figure out why that didn&#039;t work) - unfortunately it doesn&#039;t work for more than a few seconds. it will rip and relay, but after a few seconds of input it will lock up (at max cpu load) for some time. eventually, it will start ripping again - but never for more than a few seconds.</p><p>i&#039;ve put up my binary, maybe somebody else will be more successfull using it... don&#039;t say i didn&#039;t warn you.</p><p><a href="http://www.djmacgyver.net/tmp/streamripper">http://www.djmacgyver.net/tmp/streamripper</a></p><p>unfortunately, i&#039;m not very good at c coding, and after a quick look at the streamripper sources it might take me ages to understand what it actually does, let alone me fixing this... i guess it was worth a try, but that&#039;s it for me. sorry...</p><p>edit: i&#039;m just trying it on a different stream and it actually seems to work... so it seems as if what causes those &quot;hickups&quot; is somewhat stream-related. i guess it&#039;s the meta-info sent along with it, because the stream i tested before keeps changing its meta-info in rather short intervals, and the one i&#039;m testing right now hasn&#039;t changed yet...</p><p>so i guess this is a typical case of ymmv. maybe i&#039;ll take another look into it (maybe i can&#039;t fix the meta-extraction, but disabling could be an option too).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dj_macgyver</strong> on 23 Feb 2007, 21:46)</p>

					<p>update: disabling the meta-information parsing seems to be possible by simply passing a -E commandline switch to the program. i tried &quot;-E /bin/true&quot; and am now successfully ripping the problematic stream mentioned above despite any metadata updates. when using the -E switch one might consider passing &quot;-A -a filename.mp3&quot; too since the resulting file would be named &quot; - .mp3&quot; otherwise.</p>									</div>

					<p>i just copied it to /usr/bin (via samba... but putting it on a usb key or similiar should also work). you&#039;ll have to make it executable with the command:</p><p>chmod u+x /usr/bin/streamripper</p><p>then you&#039;ll be able to call it from any directory. typing &quot;streamripper -h&quot; should give you the command line options available...</p><p>if i remember correct (i&#039;m at work right now and can&#039;t check) the command line i used was:</p><p>streamripper &lt;URL&gt; -E /bin/true -r -R 0 -A -a</p><p>replace &lt;URL&gt; with the http:// url of the stream you would like to rip.</p><p>this should create a directory named after the stream you requested, and the program should store some weird-named mp3 files inside (the weird names are because the &quot;-E&quot; disables automatic file naming, because it&#039;s not working). stop the program by using strg-c.</p><p>you could also specify a fixed name with the -a parameter, but please be warned that the program will overwrite the file once it has to reconnect - i wouldn&#039;t recommend that.</p><p>also, this will enable the built-in stream relay for an unlimited count of connections. that means that you could point your desktop streaming client(s) (e.g. winamp / xmms / mplayer) to the url http://&lt;ip-of-openwrt-box&gt;:8000 instead of wasting the bandwidth for 2 streaming connections.</p><p>i&#039;ll check the command line again once i&#039;m home.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dj_macgyver</strong> on 28 Feb 2007, 15:04)</p>

					<p>ok the syntax i posted above is correct. here&#039;s an example of what i&#039;m using:</p><p>streamripper <a href="http://gbs01.de:8012">http://gbs01.de:8012</a> -r -R 0 -E /bin/true -a -A</p><p>(that&#039;s for a german radio station called GlobalBeats FM)</p><p>one thing i forgot: using my examples, all directories containing ripped streams will go into the current working directory. so either cd to your usb hard drive before running above command, or use the -d switch to pass a different output directory instead.</p><p>hope this helps <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dj_macgyver</strong> on 28 Feb 2007, 18:34)</p>
