					<p>Hi, <br />Do you know of any automatic way to test OpenWRT?<br />E.g. i plan to have an array of routers loading my changes and need a system-test to run around them and let me know what harm i caused if any.</p><p>Is there any system-test ( blackbox or whitebox) that can test OpenWRT sanity?</p><p>Thanks a lot<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ron</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, I can test my own code, the issue is how can I, or anyone else on this community, verify their code didn&#039;t brake any of OpenWrt features.</p><p>In other words, I would assume that it is essential to have an overall OpenWrt system test suite.<br />I would also assume it is used to approve new releases, as well as to verify target (specific router models) operation by target owners.</p><p>If there is such a test suite, i would like to ask how can I get it.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ron</p>									</div>
