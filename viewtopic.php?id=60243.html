					<p>Hey, </p><p>I have already posted a similar question to no avail, but now, after some research, I might have to rephrase:</p><p>I have a Soundmate M1/ Airmusic NW11 audio wifi streaming device as discussed <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=50512">here</a>.</p><p>My current setup is:</p><br /><p>lan devices ------------- non-openWrt-Router&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;&nbsp; WIFI connection &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;soundmate M1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt; WIFI connection&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;devices</p><p>Using the default config of the soundmate as posted <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=59830">here</a> the box only routes the internet connection to the connected clients. But neither clients connected to the main routers network nor client in the subnet of the soundmate can see each other as hosts.</p><p>I tried to adjust the config as described <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedclient">here</a>, but this did not solve it. Problem is, that I am neither able to install new software like relayd nor that I have a /etc/config/firewall.</p><p>Any ideas?</p>									</div>

					<p>I managed to solve this by setting up the &quot;pseudobridge&quot;-relayd-config described in <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient">this guide</a>. Apparently, this is necessary to fulfill the requirements of</p><p>- Having the box work as an access point that routes the internet to its connected clients<br />- Having the box work as a (streaming) client throughout the whole network, i.e. the devices connected to the main router as well as devices connected to box itself <br />- Allowing all devices throughout the entire network to communicate with each other.&nbsp; </p><br /><p>The most struggle was to install relayd on the device without a proper packet manager, only using wget. <br />Since the &quot;tar&quot; implementation of the OS seemingly also had problems extracting .gz-archives, I had to first download a relayd tarball (fitting the atheros-architecture) to my computer, extract the contents and then manually transfer them to the box via direct links. <br />Once this was done, I could manually copy them to the correct folders, in other words do a manual installation. There was also a missing library (libubox) which had to be implemented the same way.</p><p>After this was done, I was able to follow the guide. To make my box accessible (and by this usable as a media streaming device) throughout the network, I had to assign an IP to it, as suggested in the guide. You also have to provide a netmask, otherwise it didn&#039;t work for me. This might be obvious, but since it is not explicitly mentioned in the guide I wanted to point it out.</p><p>To make sure that the same IP is given to the box at all times, I gave it a static IP within the DHCP settings of my main router. The other possible option, to set the &quot;proto&quot; option of the network device within the box to &quot;static&quot; and by that fix the IP on the client side didn&#039;t work for me.</p><p>I disabled the firewall, too, although I am not sure whether this was necessary to get it working.</p><p>Hope this helps others, who face similar challenges.</p>									</div>
