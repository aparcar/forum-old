					<p>Hi, TL-MR3020 worked very well, but after my last change something went wrong... Last change which I made was set DHCP client to LAN port, but LAN and Wifi was in bridge. After &quot;save and apply&quot; I cant access to router and I dont know what IP address router has (in dhcp server I dont see added IP to router...). I try reset to failmode, see&nbsp; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-mr3020#failsave.mode">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl- â€¦ lsave.mode</a> , but now routers LED lights are off (although it is the router lan cabel), only WPS/Reset button light.<br />How can I repair it? It is possible that the device is dead forever?<br />Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>SOLVED, I wrong click on reset button...&nbsp; I think that advice on wiki is bad, because,&nbsp; only one click on reset button is enough, when router is booting and then router go to fail-mode (LED is still flashing).</p>									</div>
