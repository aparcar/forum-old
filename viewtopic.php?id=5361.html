					<p>Hi Everyone,</p><p>I need to connect an external 56Kbps modem to one of my WGT643UNAR units through the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Netgear/WGT634U#head-6128a64e71f6af2e38e2b1e0066d8b3c08d62d2a">J7 serial console</a>. I understand that I need to build a serial console cable using the MAX3241 chip and connect this serial console to an external 56kbps modem. I am pretty sure this is a very straightforward issue here; however, I just wanted to be sure that I don&#039;t do any asininity here to cause damages to the router. So, the questions I have are as follows:</p><p>1. Has anyone tried this before? If so, any particular thing I should avoid to cause problems?</p><p>2. Once I built the cable interface, can anyone point to me how to I go to configure this router to automatically access the modem to detect the line and dial the ISP number? Also, a trick to cut the connection if the line has been idle for X minutes will also be nice to know.</p><p>Many thanks.</p>									</div>
