					<p>So, I bought a Nexx WT3020F router about a month ago on Aliexpress. It arrived the other day, and I set about setting it up. I tried following the guide linked below. IIRC, I tried both mtd0 and mtd3, because I had seen in another guide that you were supposed to use mtd0. When mtd0 didn&#039;t work, I switched over to mtd3. After I flashed it, the telnet connection went dead. I waited for about an hour just to be safe, and then I tried to reboot it. Now it doesn&#039;t work. There is no WiFi connection broadcasted, and if I connect my laptop to the LAN port, all I get is a spinning wheel under ethernet. The light doesn&#039;t light up.<br />I&#039;ve attempted to boot it while holding the reset button for 10 seconds, but that hasn&#039;t worked either. Has anyone got any ideas? I searched the forums before posting, as well as google, and while I did find some posts, none of the solutions I found worked. </p><p>I appreciate any and all responses. </p><p>Also, it turns out for some reason I can&#039;t post a link. The tutorial I followed is the securityskeptic article talking about the Nexx router and turning it into a tor relay node. I tried to link it, but I got an error.</p>									</div>

I soldered a wire to tx, to rx and to gnd. I tried following a tutorial, which I&#039;ll link below, but I didn&#039;t get any output in the console. Do you have any advice on what&#039;s happening? I&#039;m just shooting in the dark here, but I think I may have overwritten UBOOT. Is there any way to recover from that?</p><p>snakelab.cc/2014/12/05/howto_flash_openwrt_on_wt3020.html</p>									</div>

It was the factory standard OS the whole time. <br />By spinning wheel, I mean that little icon that shows that the ethernet recognized the device as something, but wasn&#039;t able to connect to it. There are no lights under the ethernet ports, so I can&#039;t use that as an indicator. All I have is the CP2102. There are no ports on the board that I can use other than TX, RX, and GND. Am I toast, or is there anything else I can do?</p>									</div>

					<p>If the Ethernet ports don&#039;t get initiailzed, the bootloader is probably not running and you won&#039;t see anything on serial.&nbsp; The most likely reason for this is that the flash partition where the bootloader is stored has been erased or corrupted.</p><p>Connect a device that has a hardware based green light or other way you can see layer 1 link status to one of the Ethernet ports and see if the ports come on.&nbsp; It is not necessary to see if any data can be passed, only to see if the carrier signal is present on the wire.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 12 Apr 2018, 20:17)</p>
