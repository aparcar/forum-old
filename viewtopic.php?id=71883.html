					<p>I&#039;ve been playing with this router for a couple of days now and have read everything I could find about it.</p><p>The documentation says limited support for this router.&nbsp; I was able to flash it, but when I try to install kmod-ath9k, it runs out of memory and will not complete the installation.</p><p>So, does &quot;limited&quot; support mean that there is not enough space to load the drivers to get the WiFi to work?</p><p>Would it be possible to make a custom bin without support for something else, in order to save enough room to install the driver for the WiFi?&nbsp; What would make enough space, perhaps dropping IPV6 support?</p><p>Thanks,</p>									</div>
