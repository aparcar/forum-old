					<p>I&#039;ve just bought a Linksys WRT350N v2 (mainly for the gigabit switch it has). I cracked it open, and it has a Atheros AR5008 for the wireless (I can see the AR5416 chip on it). The CPU is a 500MHz Arm, the Marvell Orion 88F5181 as <a href="http://www.vonwentzel.net/ABS/Dissection-Extreme-n/Marvell-pp.jpg">pictured here</a> which is also used in the <a href="http://www.macintouch.com/readerreports/wirelessnetworking/topic4525.html">airport extreme</a> and has had <a href="ftp://ftp.dlink.com/GPL/DNS-323/">Linux ported to it</a> for the <a href="http://wiki.dns323.info/">D-Link DNS-323</a>. The RAM is <a href="http://www.etron.com/manager/uploads/EM6A9160%20rev1.4.pdf%20">16MB 200MHz SDRAM</a> and the flash is Samsung k8d6316utm 8MB (64Mbit).</p><p>How can I help get OpenWRT supported on this device?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello. The 2x10 ARM JTAG connector on the wrt350n-v2 board doesn&#039;t seem to be working, I can&#039;t even get the JTAG chain scan. Does anyone have any idea if the linksys disabled it in this model, and how could I bring it back to life? I&#039;ve got a bricked router I would really like to fix...</p>									</div>

					<p>We have had success getting the JTAG port on the wrt350n v2 to work by swapping the TMS and TDI lines -- the CPU (the only device in the scan chain) identifies itself, and we were able to single-step it using OpenOCD and make a dump of the flash memory.</p><p>I&#039;m wondering whether they swapped the TMS and TDI lines as some kind of anti-hacking measure, or whether they just screwed up on the board layout.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have a WRT350N v1 that&#039;s bricked (thanks to the snapshots, I don&#039;t think they include a 2.6 driver for the switch), at least, it has Linux in it but the switch doesn&#039;t respond to pings on 192.168.1.1 and the LEDs that light up don&#039;t match which port I plug Ethernet into, so I need to open this to get to the serial port / JTAG... can you please post instructions on how to open it up, I&#039;ve managed to pry the front of the bottom silver plate and one side of the top silver plate away but don&#039;t wanna just keep pulling at the wrong place and break the case.</p>									</div>
