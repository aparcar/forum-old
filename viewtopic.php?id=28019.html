					<p>i started this in another thread, but i think it would be better to break it out into its own thread.</p><p>i have been having trouble with my wrt150n after poking around in /etc/config/network.&nbsp; currently, i cannot get any response from the 4 lan ports (when booted up), and cannot access it using the &quot;internet&quot; port.&nbsp; it does send dhcp requests over the internet port, though.&nbsp; i can upload a new firmware to the router via tftp, however it has never had any effect.&nbsp; i have also tried to access the router using telnet, but when i put the router in failsafe mode i am unable to access it at all.&nbsp; also, when it sends the udp &quot;please press the reset button&quot; packet, the packet comes out horribly mangled.&nbsp; anyone have any ideas as to how i could fix my router?</p><p>EDIT: i thought i should add that i took out the vlans in /etc/config/network.&nbsp; that&#039;s what messed up everything</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Styx</strong> on 7 Jan 2011, 03:47)</p>

					<p>You can flash new firmware, but you have no other access to router. Correct?</p><p>You should maybe build a new firmware version, into which you would embedd working settings.</p><p>I am sure you have regularly made a backup copy of your settings, so you have a &quot;last known good&quot; settings copy somewhere.</p><p>Altenatively, browse source code repository for default settings for your model.</p><p>Embedd /etc/config/network (and also firewall settings and also possible the essential config files) from that backup copy into the new build, so that you can have a working config flashed in along the firmware.</p><p>As long as you have TFTP access, there is hope ;-)</p><br /><p>Ps. I did not quite understand, if you had a working telnet access or not. If you can access it with telnet, then you could just edit /etc/config/network based on model/backup copy of the file.</p>									</div>

					<p>i have no telnet access.&nbsp; that&#039;s the problem.&nbsp; and fyi, that would have no effect; i can access the router when it wants to talk, but it doesn&#039;t feel like using telnet.</p>									</div>
