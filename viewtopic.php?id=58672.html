					<p>Hi there, I am willing to start a project to research how many &#039;WiFi&#039; devices are in the building, where and &#039;how long&#039; in order to design WLAN properly.</p><p>I want to buy following router: TP-Link TL-WR3020</p><p>On this router I will install OpenWRT to:<br />- put radio in Monitor Mode</p><p>And to install and run needed packages to:<br />- capture network probes from WiFi devices<br />- scan on multiple channels (1,6,9,11)<br />- log and save probe request (e.g. on usb flashdrive) in csv format</p><p>If possible, send realtime or per 15min the logfiles about probe request to a server (ftp or mysql)</p><p>Can anyone advice in which type of packages I need - or are needed in order to realise above features?</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>

					<p>Okay thanks for this link - still some questions even reading this article:</p><p>- how to scan mutiple channels?<br />- how to export the data logfiles from probe requests?<br />- is there a way to send the logfiles (connected to LAN) to a server - ftp server ? Instead of keeping it on the USB flash drive?</p>									</div>
