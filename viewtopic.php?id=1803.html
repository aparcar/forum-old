					<p>Hi all, I,ve just installed openwrt on a Lynksys WRT54G. It is attached to a&nbsp; D-Link DFE-96Ds router which also has a Linux file server attached which I wand to keep on a seperate network. The D-LInk router is attached to a Caymen 3300 DSL modem. Before I installed&nbsp; OpenWRT the LYnksys was set to 192.168.10.1 and was working fine. After the installation I could not Telnet into it so I held down the reset button for 30 seconds. I can now telnet into it at 192.168.1.1 but I can&#039;t ping anything outside the unit. Which files do I have to edit to change the units IP adress back to 192.168.10.1 Has anyone written a howto for changing settings in OpenWRT? Any advice or help would be very much appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve read the Docs and deleted&nbsp; udhcpd.conf from /etc. I then copied it from /rom/etc and used vi to edit the ip to 192.168.10.1. Then&nbsp; I rebooted the wrt. However when I opened udhcpd.conf it had reverted to 192.168.1.1 What am I doing wrong? Maybe it&#039;s just that Ive lost two nights sleep fighting with it and I&#039;m too tired&nbsp; to spot something simple.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks Duff. That helped me to understand what I&#039;m doing a bit better. I can now telnet into the WRT and set IP etc. I have a static IP and I have setup pinholes in the Caymen DSL mdem to allow traffic over various ports for smpp, http, smtp, jabber and other services that I run on my main server. The Caymen modem handles DHCP. However it is not giving a lease to the WRTG. Any ideas or pointers you can offer? Regards Sean</p>									</div>
