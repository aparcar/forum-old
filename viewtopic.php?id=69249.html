					<p>Hey!</p><p>What is the correct term for the use case as explained below and - if possible - how can it be achieved using a wrt54gl and OpenWrt or similar?</p><p>A wireles network &quot;A&quot; is installed, and I have two valid IPs. &quot;A&quot; is connected to the internet. I can&#039;t change Network &quot;A&quot;.</p><p>Now, I need to set up a second network &quot;B&quot; at a different subnet.<br />&quot;B&quot; will have wireless and cabel connections.<br />All devices in &quot;B&quot; should be linked/routed to one of A&#039;s IPs and need to be accessible by internet connections.</p><p>Any Ideas?</p><br /><p>Thank you, guys!!!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>skydome</strong> on 6 Jan 2017, 19:14)</p>

					<p>This is routed client mode.&nbsp; There is a wiki page about it.&nbsp; Very simply, you make a wifi client that connects to A, and use it as your WAN device instead of the fifth ethernet port.&nbsp; Everything else can be a default configuration.&nbsp; As you noted, you need to be sure your lan subnet is not the same as the wan (that you get from A).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 6 Jan 2017, 22:41)</p>
