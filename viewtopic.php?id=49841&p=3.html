					<p>A quick update, another linux &amp; openwrt buff who tests images for me has found that in some cases, the build based on trunk 40859 fails due to a change in the ath9k driver.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had a look and added the option to support some OEM cards.&nbsp; Taken from SVN revision logs:</p><p>ath9k: make support for PC-OEM cards optional, reduces module size</p><p>This means that while the image does boot up as expected, for some router models the build will crash and reboot when attempting to bring up the wifi interfaces on the device.</p><p>In the build I am working on now based on trunk 40863, I have enabled this option, and also will only have the ath10k driver available for the TP-Link Archer C7 routers...I think they&#039;re the only one in the ar71xx supported router list that have the AC WiFi card in them?&nbsp; Someone like to confirm this for me please?</p><p>Other than the above, build 40863 will be identical to build 40859.</p>									</div>

					<p>Gary,<br />For Kernel modules like the one you&#039;re looking to install, you cannot install the ones from the OpenWRT snapshot builds.&nbsp; That said, if I haven&#039;t provided a kernel module package for something then it is likely not going to work for you.</p><p>I&#039;ll be doing a fresh set of builds next week, looks like your device is a WNDR4300 so I will see what I can do up.&nbsp; Note that I am having problems with WiFi interfaces not coming up in recent trunk revisions for some of the generic devices (one being the TP-Link WDR4300) and I do have a separate thread open on the forums here, plus a ticket open for the devs too.&nbsp; No solution is forthcoming so far...</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks Adam!&nbsp; Looking forward to trying you WNDR4300 setup.&nbsp; Can you provide a .config I could use to get me to the same point you are at?<br />I&#039;ve not been successful to get latest trunk to build. make menuconfig is really hard to get it right.. Looks like you have the magic set to work.</p><p>NFS is one of the last parts to fix for me.&nbsp; ?? why does overlay filesystem only 12mb instead of 128mb NAND.&nbsp; I tried installing allot of<br />packages on device. Ran out of mem pretty quickly..&nbsp; I tried to use an alternate overlay via the gui. Plugged in a USB stick with 5GB. I checked<br />use this as the root overlay.. Yet its not taking..&nbsp; &nbsp;Any ideas?</p><p>I tried following this guide to enable USB device as an overlay.. It failed to work at boot..&nbsp; I think because USB devices are not init early enough to<br />be seen.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gary.collins</strong> on 30 May 2014, 22:01)</p>

					<p>Hi all,<br />Due to ill health I&#039;ve had to take a breather from a few things so as soon as I am back on deck I will update you all on what I have updated things with.<br />I also had a difficult task of migrating servers into VM&#039;s as well and I think most of this is now completed; the savings of this work out to at least $1 per day on electricity alone.&nbsp; I had to do it since I&#039;ve been unable to work full time now for over 6 months...and with that in mind $30 a month is a lot of money to save.</p>									</div>

					<p>hi,AdamK,thanks for your&nbsp; working on building OpenWRT.I have looking for your update for a few days .Today I have install your latest firmware on my wndr3700V4 and it works well.But when I mount my USB harddisk (the file system is ntfs)with mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1 and the file system is readonly even I use mount -o rw .Then I want to install ntfs-3g with opkg install ntfs-3g and I got <br />Collected errors:<br /> * satisfy_dependencies_for: Cannot satisfy the following dependencies for ntfs-3g:<br /> * &nbsp; &nbsp; kernel (= 3.10.36-1-427233cd53f4a891ecf66f4299844a5a) * <br /> * opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package ntfs-3g.</p><p>another is how to mount cifs&nbsp; , there are too many errors===&gt;&nbsp; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/cifs.client">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/cifs.client</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />So,what I should do.And would you mind build a ntfs-3g.ipk in your packages.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zhouruixi</strong> on 25 Jun 2014, 17:46)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m surprised that I had not built that package already.&nbsp; For some reason I thought I had.&nbsp; You are quite correct however, that package is not being built and according to the wiki it needs to be.&nbsp; I will do a fresh build today including that package and also will include fdisk which according to the wiki will allow for manual scripting of hotplug features.</p><p>As for CIFS, I will try adding that in for all ar71xx devices, however if it makes the image too large I may have to omit it for generic devices and only offer it for devices with 16MB of flash &amp; NAND generic devices (which would cover off on your WNDR3700v4).</p><p>Thank you very much for highlighting that mistake!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>AdamK</strong> on 26 Jun 2014, 01:06)</p>

					<p>Okay yes having CIFS and the extra modules with that for it to function properly does blow out the size of the images.</p><p>So this is what I will do.&nbsp; I will have it compiled in for the NAND generic devices and for the TP-LINK TL-WDR3500-3600-4300-4310 and MW4530r-v1</p><p>However for all other devices, Samba, and file system support will not be in the base image.&nbsp; What I will do though is offer the ipk files on the server for you to download and install should you desire Samba functionality and have the flash space to support this.&nbsp; Otherwise the image with everything included is too large for several devices.</p><p>Changes so far with this build:<br />*&nbsp; Removed the ath10k driver for all devices except the Archer C7 v2 which needs this for 802.11ac<br />*&nbsp; Removed Samba and the following filesystem support for all devices except all NAND generic and TP-Link devices listed above.&nbsp; Filesystems are ext4, ntfs, fat32/ms-dos and associated supporting kernel language modules.&nbsp; Should users of affected devices need this support they can download the ipk files from my server<br />*&nbsp; Except as mentioned above, added CIFS, UTF-8, NTFS-3G packages/support<br />*&nbsp; TP-LINK Archer C7 v2 now is built separately and is the only device built with ath10k support (for 802.11ac)<br />*&nbsp; Corrected a configuration regression which meant the block-mount package was no longer compiled, this is required for various filesystems to mount in openwrt.</p><p>Sorry if that all seems confusing, but with all the features, many devices now do not have enough flash space <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>AdamK</strong> on 26 Jun 2014, 03:47)</p>
