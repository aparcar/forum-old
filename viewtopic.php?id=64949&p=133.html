					<p>I&#039;ve switched my primary router to 3200 on latest David&#039;s build.<br />So far so good, both WiFi works stable. Coverage a bit extended compared to previous one (Xiaomi mi3 router).<br />5G is better for sure, my work PC is always on AC, instead of fallback to 2.4G N.<br />I&#039;ve got two issues, but both is LEDE-specific, not Wifi-related... first one, on status page I saw WAN interface as br-lan local IP. It&#039;s known &quot;issue&quot; - i&#039;ve configured default GW as routed local IP in br-lan, so UCI web script showed that interface as WAN. Removed the GW and now showing right ipv4 WAN interface including DNSes.<br />THe second strange issue I&#039;ve got is the dnsmasq won&#039;t startup after reboot.<br />I have to run in manually after reboot... I see no any logs of dnsmasq in /tmp/syslog</p><p>what I see is following:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@LINKSYS:~# ps -ef| grep dns

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Apologies for a question of basic nature.</p><p>I have a 3200acm that has stock firmware on partition 2 and dd-wrt on partition 1. It is currently running off dd-wrt on partition 1. I wanted to try Davidc’s firmware. So, I booted to partition 2, stock firmware. Used the file “lede-mvebu-linksys-wrt3200acm-squashfs-factory-2017-08-20.img” and used stock firmware to update/ overwrite partition 1.</p><p>But, after the update, when the router booted to partition 1, the radios did not come up. The power LED was glowing solid. But the internet LED was blinking, white. I power cycled the router but same result.</p><p>Can someone suggest what went wrong? Will OpenWRT not write onto a partition being used by dd-wrt? Should I first put stock firmware on both partitions and then try? Should I not change the name of the firmware file? I added the release date to the name.</p><p>If this has already been answered, can someone point me to the solution.</p><p>Thank you for your time.</p>									</div>

You need to do this as your modem needs to rebind with your router (I am probably not using correct terminology here)</p><p>2. LEDE has wireless disabled by default as it would be insecure to have an open wireless connection. Instead, hook up a computer via ethernet and go to 192.168.1.1. You will log in with no password, and then you can set a password. From there, go to the wireless config setup (I believe it is under Network -&gt; Wireless) and you can enable your wireless bands, along with configure channels, security etc.)</p>									</div>
