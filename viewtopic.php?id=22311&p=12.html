In other words, if you want to use multiple SSIDs on one radio, each network must have a distinct subnet from any other network on your system (including your wired network). Actually, given the issue with the ath9k driver, I&#039;m not even entirely sure if this scenario will work properly for handling broadcast frames.</p><p>There might be some permutations of encryption combinations that actually do work without those restrictions (maybe one VIF with WPA2 and one with WEP, as a hypothetical and untested example) but I don&#039;t think anyone has checked it yet. I know that 2 VIFs running WPA2 do not work for sure.</p><p>If you don&#039;t follow this guideline, your system will &quot;sort of&quot; work: all of your wireless devices should still be able to get to your WAN interface okay (since it&#039;s routed), but you will probably have significant trouble trying to access devices on other parts of the bridge.</p><p>The only solutions I am aware of are to either:</p><p>1) disable hardware encryption in the ath9k module, or<br />2) use one and only one encrypted VIF per radio, and set the others on the same radio to no encryption</p>									</div>

					<p>I had a few problems with the ath9k driver and my WNDR3700.

If it&#039;s the tracker/torrent build, those were built statically, so those kernels probably don&#039;t have support for installing the imq module. If that is the case, you&#039;ll probably need to recompile the build yourself, or alternatively, try to get one of the public snapshot builds from <a href="http://www.openwrt.org">www.openwrt.org</a> to work. I assume that those were built with all-module support--although I think the kmod-ath9k package there still may have problems with not being built with the option to respect the user&#039;s regdomain, so that may not be a viable option either.</p>									</div>
