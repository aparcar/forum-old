					<p>Hello,</p><p>I disabled the DHCP by mistake and I can&#039;t access the router anymore even If I set the IP 192.168.1.2 and the Gateway 192.168.1.1 manually. Ping doesn&#039;t respond and I don&#039;t know what to do. I tried the failsafe method but it didn&#039;t work neither. The router is set as repeater so I&#039;m seeing it connected to the main router but it doesn&#039;t help me to access. Could you help me please?</p><p>Thank you so much for your time.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you turned off DHCP, then more than likely, your PC/Mac/Linux machine will _not_ have an IP address in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet. The IP address should still be on the router, but you will need to manually set the IP address on your PC/Mac/Linux machine before you can communicate with the router.</p><p>IPv6 Plug: You _could_ connect to the router with IPv6, but you would need to know the IPv6 address of the router or use a discovery tool like v6disc</p><p><a href="https://github.com/cvmiller/v6disc">https://github.com/cvmiller/v6disc</a></p>									</div>
