					<p>What is the status of wifi support on the Asus WL-500gP v2?</p><p>I got a Linux 2.6 kernel built, and with the help of the Wiki page, I even got USB working, but it seems as though any talk about wireless support (especially on the 2.6 kernel) becomes rather sketchy.</p><p> - Waldemar</p>									</div>

					<p>The integrated 802.11 b/g PHY in this machine&#039;s processor, the BCM5354, is of type LP, which appears to mean &#039;low power&#039;. Now whether it&#039;s low power or high power of universal cosmic all-power doesn&#039;t matter; what matters is that the LP PHY is an unknown entity and unsupported in current drivers. The reverse engineering effort is on-going; you can check progress at <a href="http://bcm-v4.sipsolutions.net/">http://bcm-v4.sipsolutions.net/</a>.</p><p>Once those specs are complete, then drivers can be written by completely separate parties.</p>									</div>

					<p>But It is fully supported on the Kernel 2.4 , If it has not been reverse-engineered yet, how can it work perfectly as AP on 2.4 Kernel ? I personally used it on dd-wrt for 4 months without a flaw. Now I&#039;m trying to get it working on Kamikaze for the 2.6 Kernel but also having trouble.</p>									</div>
