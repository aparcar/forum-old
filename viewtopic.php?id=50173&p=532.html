Author: Steven Barth &lt;steven@midlink.org&gt;
Date:   Mon Sep 7 19:29:25 2015 +0000

    Disable telnet in favor of passwordless SSH

    This enables passworldless login for root via SSH whenever no root
    password is set (e.g. after reset, flashing without keeping config
    or in failsafe) and removes telnet support alltogether.
