					<p>Is your software package GPLed? If so, you may want to update and/or maintain your software package on the OpenWRT packages feeds. Then, download the OpenWRT trunk source and start to cross compile from source.</p>									</div>

					<p>Your questions:</p><p>1) It appears by the image names you gave, that your virtual machine image is x86 (32bit), while the toolchain is x86_64 (64_bit). Get the toolchain from the same directory as the image.</p><p>2) Raspberry Pi is brcm2708 (brcm2709 for RPi2 with ARMv7). I believe the first (brcm2708) will produce binaries that work also on RPi2 in most cases.</p><p>3) I dont know.</p><p>4) I dont know.</p><p>5) It should be possible. You can install gcc at least. Not sure about make. I think it is better you cross compile. It is quite easy once you get it to work.</p><p>6) Regardless... of cross compiling or not... if you need those libraries for your application you will need to build them from source somehow.</p><p>I suggest you start with a simple helloworld.c, and make sure you can cross compile it, and run it on your target.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi all, I have to return into this topic after several time and a fresh acquired experience writing software under linux and OpenWRT. Many thanks to anybody helped me solving a lot of issues, too.</p><p>Unfortunately I have paused my porting under OpenWRT due to a linking problem, but in order to go deeper into the above issue I need to briefly give you some details about my software.</p><p>It is made of three modules: LIB-1, LIB-2 and APP.</p><p>I&#039;m developing it under LUbuntu with Netbeans/C++ and CMake. I&#039;m cross compiling by CMake (I successfully followed this guide <a href="http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/CMake_Cross_Compiling#The_toolchain_file">http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/CMake_Cross_Com … chain_file</a>) and a I have built a toolchain and a target Generic-x86 OpenWRT image by the latest official BUILDROOT tool (it works under VirtualBox like a charm).</p><p>I set the CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY and CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY to a common folder (${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/bin) in order to have all the binaries into the same folder.</p><p>Now, I build the project for LUbuntu and inside the ouput folder I find LIB-1.so, LIB-2.so and APP, as expected. Then I execute &#039;ldd&#039; on APP and I see it referencing LIB-1.so and LIB-2.so as expected. By the verbose CMake output I see also that CMake sets (as expected) the RPATH which points to &#039;${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/bin&#039;.</p><p>Now go into the issue details...</p><p>I build the project for OpenWRT and inside the output folder I find all the three files, as expected. Then I execute &#039;ldd&#039; and &#039;objdump -x&#039; and I see that APP links to &#039;../bin/LIB-1.so&#039; and &#039;../bin/LIB-2.so&#039; (file name plus a relative path prefix!!!). The other difference is that CMake (I don&#039;t know why) does not add the RPATH on the linking command line!</p><p>In order to get APP linked to the two libraries without the relative &#039;../bin&#039; path, I have to put the two SO files inside the APP linking folder, and manually run the linker stripping the &#039;../bin/&#039; prefix, and adding &#039;-Wl,-rpath,${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/bin&#039; too.</p><p>Could anybody explain me:</p><p>1) Why CMake links the two platforms using different command line parameters?</p><p>2) How can I link with CMake avoind embedding the relative .SO path?</p><p>3) If none of the readers uses CMake, could somebody tell me if exists an additional parameter for the G++ linker to strip relative paths from the referenced LIBs?</p><p>Thank you very much!<br />Antonio</p>									</div>
