					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a problem with the trunk version of kamikaze (x86 platform kernel 2.6.25.4). </p><p>The /dev/net/tun device somtimes is not created at boot time. The module is loaded and is reported by lsmod but the device is not created.</p><p>I could find an exact way to replicate the problem, but out of 20 reboots 1 fails to create the device. Anybody is having the same problem? If so, is there a way to use the watchdog to check such condition and reboot automatically the device?</p><p>Thanks in advance for any hints.</p><p>Roberto</p>									</div>

					<p>I can see one way of trying to fix this problem. Create an rc.local script that checks for the presence of the /dev/net/tun device and if it does not exist, call mknod to create the device, something like this:</p><p>mknod /dev/net/tun c 10 200</p><p>This option does not require a reboot.</p><p>You should also check to make sure the the tun module is loaded.</p><p>The hotplug scripts are what control creating the devices so you should check there for possible problems in getting the device created.</p><p>Gus</p>									</div>

					<p>I observe exactly the same problem, sometimes (once in 10 - 30 reboots) /dev/net/tun is not created (/dev/net does not even exist), although the tun kernel module is successfully loaded, and if i manually do<br />mkdir /dev/net<br />mknod /dev/net/tun c 10 200<br />then everything is fine.</p><p>So i will do it like gwirth suggested, check for it in a later script file and if it&#039;s not existing create it by hand, but out of curiosity i&#039;d really like to know why this happens sometimes.</p><p>So what is responsible for creating /dev/net/tun ??</p><p>Edit:<br />On the sane systems (where /dev/net/tun is automatically created), when i do<br />rmmod tun<br />rm /dev/net/tun<br />rmdir /dev/net</p><p>the device file /dev/net/tun gets created again when i do<br />insmod tun</p><p>On the seldom faulty systems i can do as often as i want rmmod tun / insmod tun, and never get that /dev/net/tun created?!</p><br /><p>Regards</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lightblue</strong> on 30 Jan 2009, 18:39)</p>

					<p>I have the same problem on the recent trunk version. I have to create /dev/net everytime the device (mine is wndr3700 V1) boots so &quot;insmod tun&quot; can create /dev/net/tun. Does anybody know what&#039;s the reason? Why the trunk version not long ago (svn35866) works as expected but recent one doesn&#039;t?</p>									</div>
