					<p>Yes you can do that-- go to the Network: Switch page and change the line that runs eth0 from VLAN 0 to VLAN 30, and make port 4 (the WAN Ethernet) tagged instead of untagged.</p><p>Be sure to flash a version that is late enough for your model.&nbsp; The one you downloaded probably will not work.&nbsp; Read the big thread about the 1900/3200 series and the wiki page to select the firmware to use.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 29 Apr 2017, 01:28)</p>

					<p>You should have two VLANs, one with 5 ports active in it and one with two.&nbsp; The one with two is the link from the CPU to the WAN ethernet port on the back.&nbsp; You need to make that one VLAN ID 30 and tag the physical port, which according to the wiki page would be number 4.</p><p>Always a good idea to create a wifi AP and log in by wifi before trying to change the switch configuration.&nbsp; That way if you mess up the Ethernet, you can still log in.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 29 Apr 2017, 19:54)</p>
