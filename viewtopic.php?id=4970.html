					<p>I recently installed OpenWrt on a 500gx. Very generic configuration with the 500gx acting as router and DNS server for the LAN. Although the machines on the network have no problems with the 500gx as a DNS server and everything seems to work as expected, the 500gx itself is unable to make DNS queries from the shell. Using nslookup to query a specific server doesn&#039;t work either.</p><p>Here is where things get a bit stranger. If I kill dnsmasq and rerun the startup script, the 500gx is then able to make DNS queries. But now the clients on the network can&#039;t. I have confirmed that the command that is run (dnsmasq -l /tmp/dhcp.leases -K -F 10.0.0.100,10.0.0.200,255.255.255.0,12h -I vlan1)&nbsp; &nbsp;when the 500gx is rebooted is identical to the command run after killing and restarting dnsmasq (as it should be).</p><p>I have tried removing and installing dnsmasq, but that didn&#039;t resolve the problem. I have tried chaning the order the script is started. Looking through the log has not made me any wiser. I am not sure if this is a problem with this router in general since this is my first 500gx. This doesn&#039;t happen when using the WL-HDD as a router.</p><p>Here is the log: <a href="http://pastebin.com/623338">http://pastebin.com/623338</a></p><p>Any help to resolve this issue would be appreciated. It is luckily not crucial as a reboot causes the DNS to be accessible to the network clients. And since I have entered hte IP for downloads.openwrt.org into the hosts file I am now able to install software if needed.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>joebush</strong> on 26 Mar 2006, 19:47)</p>

					<p>I was able to avoid the problem by forcing dnsmasq to use /tmp/resolv.conf and creating a new /etc/resolv.conf with nameserver 127.0.0.1 (thanks mbm).</p><p>I would still be interested to know if this issue takes place on other peoples equipment, and preferable a solution to the problem. I have a hard time believing this is because of a hardware problem, so it must lie in the software somewhere.</p>									</div>

					<p>Nope, that was incorrect. I just reflashed and now have the problem again.</p><p>I also noticed that, if I kill udhcpc and dnsmasq, and then rerun S50dnsmasq, I can get queries working on the router and the network at the same time.

					<p>I&#039;m running WhiteRussian RC5 on my Linksys WRT54G, v4, configured as router for my network. Got the same problems as you described. I set up a cron job to kill dnsmasq regularly (every hour) and run the S50dnsmasq script to start everything up afterwards. Otherwise, I can access any server from my router, but only &quot;some&quot; from my network clients. &quot;Some&quot; means, sometimes pings to servers go through and I actually get replies, sometimes I just get a message &quot;host unknown&quot;. </p><p>However, if I first ping a server on my router which was not accessible from my network, most of the times I can _then_ also access this server from my network, too. Strange.</p><p>Is dnsmasq known to be a bit flaky? What can be done?</p><p>Cheers,<br />Manfred</p>									</div>
