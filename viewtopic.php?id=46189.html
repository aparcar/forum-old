					<p>Hi there,</p><p>We are planning to develop a WiFi Positioning System for the Openwrt community. And we would like to know if anyone here will be interested in using. </p><p>For now, we call it LoFi (LOcation enabled WiFi) which works as follows.</p><p>1. You will hack your WiFi APs to run Openwrt, of course :-)</p><p>2. You will need to install the opkg that we&#039;ll develop. </p><p>3. You will need to create a free account in the cloud system that we are going to create. In this cloud system, we will ask you to provide the MAC addresses of smartphones/Laptops/etc that you wish LoFi to track.</p><p>4. You will need to train LoFi, i.e., you will stand at locations that you want LoFi to know and press a &#039;training&#039; button in the cloud system. LoFi will then generate fingerprints for these locations and save in the cloud. </p><p>5. Now, LoFi is ready to be used anyone.</p><p>As a summary, LoFi is the WiFi based Location/Positioning system in the cloud. It will be free (unless you need awful a lot of storage in the cloud in which case a small fee will be charged, say you have &lt; 5 smartphones and 5 APs).</p><p>I know the explanation is over simplified but hopefully you get the idea. As we haven&#039;t started doing it yet, changes are likely but the basic logic will remain.</p><p>We are planning to have a demo in &lt; 3 months. And if you are interested, please email skyahead#gmail.com. </p><p>Comments are warm welcomed, but I may or may not visit this forum frequently.</p><p>Thanks very much<br />Tianji</p>									</div>
