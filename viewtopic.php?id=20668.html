					<p>I&#039;m considering this too. Seems to be the foundation of wireless powerhouse while<br />being affordable.

					<p>RouterStation Pro looks very interesting. I would prefer if it had a mini-PCIe slot instead of a 3rd mini-PCI slot however. Mini-PCI cards are more expansive. Does it come with a power supply for those of us who don&#039;t have PoE yet? Also, it doesn&#039;t come in a box, right?<br />Is there any other reason for not buying this and an AR5416+5133 802.11a/b/g/n 3x3 MIMO card? This card seems to be the ultimate one since it seems supported by madwifi (probably in ABG mode only) and will work with ath9k once 802.11n things get better. Coupled with a router board with a good CPU, lot of RAM and flash, and a GigE switch, it seems the perfect solution.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zorxd</strong> on 23 Sep 2009, 00:11)</p>

					<p>Thanks. I just wanted to have an idea of the total cost. I guess I will have to plan a 48V (so high? Doesn&#039;t that electronic run on 5V or less?) PSU.<br />I found some cheap 5416+5133 mini-PCI cards on ebay. I am not sure who produces them and how that company call them.<br />The SR71-A is based on the more recent (better I guess) AR9160 chip. It has PCI ID 168C:0027 according to <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/ath9k">http://wiki.debian.org/ath9k</a> and is currently supported by ath9k. However, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s supported by madwifi. It seems much more expansive however (135$US on ebay). Maybe it&#039;s a more powerfull card for outdoor long range use?</p>									</div>
