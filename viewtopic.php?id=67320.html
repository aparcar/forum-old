					<p>As the title suggests, I was moving from DD-WRT to OpenWrt using Management Firmware update. After successful upload I waited for a while and when nothing happened i rebooted the router. When it booted up only the power led was on. When I connected LAN I got ip from DHCP (192.168.1.176) but when I went to 192.168.1.1 i got &quot;ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED&quot;. My assumption was that it was bricked. So I went trough the debricking process. </p><p>I can ping 192.168.1.1, I uploaded openWRT firmware using TFTP - transfer went successful (waiting for TTL=100). After manual reboot ip scanner says that there is a device with host name OpenWrt.lan at 192.168.1.1, but I still can&#039;t access the router.</p><p>I tried flashing to the DD-WRT firmware but it still says that the hostname is OpenWrt.lan. Am i to assume that the flashing failed even thou it said it was successful? </p><p>Is my only option to disassemble it and connect it over serial?</p>									</div>

					<p>According to the Table of Hardware the WRT610 v1&amp;2 are only available in trunk, so i&#039;m just guessing that maybe you mean there is no web interface to access at 192.168.1.1, if so you need to install Luci. Here&#039;s the wiki if you want to read up on it -</p><p><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials</a></p><p>Establish an internet connection, ssh into your router, run </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>opkg update</code></pre></div><p> and then </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>opkg install luci</code></pre></div><p> At that point Luci will be installed and you can access it at 192.168.1.1</p>									</div>
