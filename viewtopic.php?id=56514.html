					<p>This is my first post. As the subject suggests I&#039;m trying to configure my WD router as a bridge. I&#039;m familiar with DD-WRT and Tomato and this is my first tryst with OpenWRT. This is what I need to do</p><p>Configure my WD router as Client Bridge operating at 5GHz so I can get 450 MPBS signal in another room for a desktop PC hardwired to the WD router. I want to use WPA2 encryption and need to be able to specify password for my 5GHz SSID from my Access Point.</p><p>I have read the following post<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=46864">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=46864</a></p><p>I understand since my WD router has an Atheros Chipset I will need to follow instructions at below URL<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient</a></p><p>My question is I&#039;m confused on which firmware to use. Do I first use the OpenWRT firmware in the instructions, i.e.<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-mynet-n750-squashfs-factory.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_br … actory.bin</a></p><p>Do I then use the following firmware which supposed to fix some wireless issues, as per this URL<br /><a href="https://www.crc.id.au/2014/01/10/wd-mynet-n600-n750-openwrt-update/">https://www.crc.id.au/2014/01/10/wd-myn … rt-update/</a></p><p>Apparently &quot;some patches have not made it yet to the OpenWRT trunk&quot;. Can I just use the latest driver which is supposed to be at the following URL, and then follow the relayd instructions?<br /><a href="http://openwrt.crc.id.au/r45058/">http://openwrt.crc.id.au/r45058/</a></p><p>Appreciate if someone can clarify. I&#039;m assuming if I&#039;m going to use the latest and I&#039;m installing OpenWRT for the first time I use the &quot;factory&quot; version. If I have older version, i.e. maybe some time in future then I would use the latest &quot;sysupgrade&quot; version. I really don&#039;t want to fry my router hence thought I would gather some input before I embarked on my quest.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>griftopia</strong> on 28 Mar 2015, 06:27)</p>

					<p>Hi dude to save you all the trouble just flash Gargoyle. Set as a bridge and forget it. It&#039;s baste on openwrt bb branch anyway so if you want to get to tweaking later on then you can.<br />Newest build here:<br /><a href="https://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=6911">https://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/v … amp;t=6911</a><br />Homepage here:<br /><a href="https://www.gargoyle-router.com/index.php">https://www.gargoyle-router.com/index.php</a></p><p>I run this build on to bridges and it runs fine for my needs.</p>									</div>

					<p>By the way wen using a router as a bridge you will not get the full speed from the 5 gig radio. As the router is working as a bridge you get half the bandwidth.</p>									</div>

One reason i am little scared is with all this configuration on comman line, and that luci/whatever setup seems complicated.</p><p>Second, i understand if i use repeater i would use half bandwidth, why when i use as client bridge? I am not looking to expand the range of my signal from the access point, just want to bridge it. With my other bridges using tomato in two other rooms, i get close to 300 mbps at 5ghz, which is what they are capable of. I got the WD for another room thinking i would get 450 mbps.</p><p>Finally, will gargoyle work with atheros chipset? Because openwrt supports client bridge but only for broadcom, which is why i am trying to dance with relayd in the first place. If it does not, then i have to figure all these things out and translate relayd instructions for the 5ghz radio using trial and error.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>griftopia</strong> on 28 Mar 2015, 14:55)</p>

					<p>yes gargoyle has a nice web GUI built in and it&#039;s only a few clicks to set up a bridge. That reference to broadcom only for bridge is likely old. Atheros is much better supported than Broadcom in OpenWrt/Gargoyle these days.</p><p>Try it and let us know how it goes!</p>									</div>
