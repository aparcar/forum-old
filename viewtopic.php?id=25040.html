					<p>I have an engenius branded EOC-2610 that I have flashed to openwrt <br /> KAMIKAZE (8.09.1, unknown) <br />per the instructions at this website: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=22009">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=22009</a></p><p>I&#039;ve installed openwrt via redboot using fonflash &amp; the version of gargoyle-router<br />on that website.</p><p>My device is working great as a simple access point after doing this.</p><p>I&#039;d like to enable AND USE Atheros&#039; XR (Extended Range) mode and am looking to you for help<br />in accomplishing this!</p><p>What I have done so far in this attempt which so far has failed is that I have edited<br />the last two lines in /etc/config/wireless</p><p>to both disable turbo (seems to be on by default)<br />and to enable &quot;xr&quot;.</p><p>I&#039;ve also tried not disabling turbo and also tried at the prompt:</p><p>this command:&nbsp; </p><p>iwpriv ath0 xr 1</p><p>It takes the command without any error kickback but XR is still not enabled &amp; working.</p><br /><br /><p>config &#039;wifi-device&#039; &#039;wifi0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;type&#039; &#039;atheros&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;channel&#039; &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;txpower&#039; &#039;17&#039;</p><br /><br /><p>config &#039;wifi-iface&#039; &#039;cfg2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;device&#039; &#039;wifi0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;mode&#039; &#039;ap&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;network&#039; &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ssid&#039; &#039;our-actual-ssid&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;encryption&#039; &#039;none&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;turbo&#039; &#039;0&#039;<br />------&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;xr&#039; &#039;1&#039;</p><br /><p>I am determining if XR is enabled &amp; working in several ways:</p><p>1. Windows atheros client connection status.. it should drop below 1Mbps<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;and indicate &quot;250kbps ofdm&quot; at some point as it gets further away from the AP<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;but the lowest mode it ever switches to at the end of it&#039;s outdoor range test is<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;1mbps 802.11b&quot; as indicated.</p><p>2. getting the same range as hard set 1Mbps 802.11b access point.</p><br /><p>3. Using the Atheros Wireless Windows client software doing scan mode (site survey)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s displays found SSIDS and it shows if they are B/G and it shows if they are<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;doing superG/turbo and it shows if they are XR capable..<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Please see my inline screenshot <a href="http://michiganbroadband.com/xr-1.jpg">http://michiganbroadband.com/xr-1.jpg</a><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;showing a scan and some other APs (not mine) that<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;are either announcing or being picked up by the Windows client as XR mode capable..<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Sorry I don&#039;t know exactly how XR mode works... if it is actually beaconed as being<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;there or if the client actually switches to XR mode and scans there for XR transmissions<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;IT REALLY SUCKS that I can&#039;t find any documentation or know where to find info on how<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;XR actually works!</p><p>Anyhow I&#039;ve been unable to get my new openwrt AP to either connect XR mode or announce<br />as seen in my scans that it is offering XR mode connectivity.</p><p>It is always announcing or showing in the scan that it is &quot;SuperG/Turbo&quot; enabled.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure why that is..<br />I&#039;ve tried turning off &quot;turbo&quot; both in the above mentioned config file<br />and by issuing a <br />iwpriv turbo 0<br />command but it still shows up in the client scan as Super-G capable.<br />Even though it&#039;s on channel 1.</p><p>I&#039;d be very grateful for any suggestions/help in enabling XR on my new openwrt device!!</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Steve</p><br /><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://michiganbroadband.com/xr-1.jpg" alt="http://michiganbroadband.com/xr-1.jpg" /></span></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stevegladden</strong> on 30 May 2010, 23:33)</p>

					<p>::BUMP::<br />Any ideas anyone?</p><p>And jow what about this?<br />This is newer and says it only works in AP Managed mode: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless</a></p><p>Under Madwifi Options<br />xr section &quot;xr&nbsp; boolean&nbsp; no&nbsp; 0&nbsp; Enables XR support, only applicable in Managed mode &quot;</p><p>My real issue is that I&#039;ve not been able to get Atheros XR to work at all in any mode or on any hardware and I am asking for help :-)<br />I can provide many many pages of detail &amp; testing once I can get an intelligent conversation started on this subject.<br />Right now I am just looking for anotehr place to start and possibly anyone knowledgeable that would be willing or interested<br />in helping me out a little on enabling and using XR mode on Atheros radios.</p><p>jow: I have of course seen the link you mention before..<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That suggests that xr will work (only) in client mode and way back in 2006.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;other links suggest to opposite.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve since been unable to get it working in either client or Managed mode.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Information on this is very scarce.. although google *is* our friend..
