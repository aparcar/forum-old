					<p>I&#039;m using a second router as a wlan bridge with a guest wlan network.<br />All traffic from this router should be restricted for legal use only. I want to make sure no illegal downloading via torrent and stuff like that can be done. I know there are ways to work around like Proxys and VPN but I want to keep it simple and just protect myself.<br />I&#039;m doing this mainly for learning purpose but this could easily be a father with a teenage kid asking for a good advice how to protect himself while letting his kid access the internet. So I guess it is a good post for anyone with the same interest.</p><p>I thought about restricting traffic and only let the &quot;good&quot; things through. Maybe by using a whitelist with port 80, 443, etc permitted.</p><p>Is this a good way to start?<br />I don&#039;t know how to do it with openwrt, can anybody help?</p>									</div>

					<p>It is possible to detect and block unencrypted torrent traffic by using l7 protocol detection in iptables, but its resource consuming and cant detect encrypted torrent traffic. For anti-piracy monitors there&#039;s no difference if someone uses encryption or not - they act as regular client and detect content seeding fact.<br />So, in my opinion the most effective option is port filtering.<br />Enable only known ports such as 25,80,53,110,443,465,995,3389 and so on.<br />Some monitors are passive and do not try to connect to you or detect your connection - they just see the fact your IP participate in a swarm. In some countries they can try to extort some money based only on that fact.<br />I see no 100% reliable way of blocking announce queries to trackers. Its quite possible to write l7 filter with regular expressions to detect bittorrent announces, but you&#039;ll have to monitor every http and udp request , its too hard for slow router CPU. Also if a tracker uses https, its not possible to detect.<br />I believe current copyright practice is shame for all the humanity</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bolvan</strong> on 7 Nov 2013, 09:31)</p>
