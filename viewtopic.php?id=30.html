					<p>I&#039;ve seen browsing thru the NVRAM values that there are two variables,<br />vlan0ports=1 2 3 4 5*<br />vlan1ports=0 5<br />which seem to control VLAN assignement for the 6 port switch.<br />Is it possible to directly modify this assignement thru some utility or it is done by the booting process, hopefully reading those variables ?</p><p>I would like to remove the bridge between WLAN(eth1) and vlan0, put all the ethernet ports into the same VLAN and then setup a firewall&nbsp; over the now routed WLAN.</p><p>thanks,<br /> Paolo.</p>									</div>

					<p>I was thinking about an other usage of wan port. I&#039;m working in a mesh network with a complete isolation of LAN network. So user can&#039;t see them self. My Idea was to use WAN port as a sort of DMZ port for wireless part.</p><p>Every computed connected to WAN are visibles and can provide any service (ftp, http ..) ; LAN connected computers a not accessibles.</p><p>I don&#039;t know if it is possible. Perhaps with bridge ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Can one of you smart folks post the appropriate NVRAM settings to allow for 4 seperate VLANs on the 4 LAN ports?&nbsp; I have played with them and managed to lock myself out of the LAN ports.<br />I would like to wind up with 6 seperate possible interfaces on the router:&nbsp; VLAN1-4 on the LAN ports, VLAN0 on the WAN port, and ETH1 for the WIFI port.&nbsp; I know admconfig will allow this to be dynamically set up in the future, but I&#039;d be happy with having it set up once at boot.</p><p>Thanks<br />John</p>									</div>
