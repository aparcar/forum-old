					<p>Ref the grugq&#039;s PORTAL. I managed to flash the TP-LINK wr703n before I had to seek help but now I have fiddled with almost every relevant setting and had to reset and reflash a bunch of times after locking myself out. Essentially I have three listed interfaces. 1) Admin (Eth0) 2) Internet (Eth1) 3) TOR (Wlan). I would ultimately like the option of being able to switch my access from wireless to ethernet in different situations but in this instance would be grateful for any TOR connection at all. I have scanned using wifi in the admin interface and connected to my home wifi network. I have connected my PC by ethernet to the wr703n. The Admin interface seems always connected by default. I try turning my computer wifi off connecting to the wr703 by ethernet with static and dhcp but still no TOR connection. I am convinced that altering the interfaces is the answer but could really do with some help. Has anyone out there managed to get any further forward (or did you find anyone who did)? Oh I also have the modded wr703n with double ram and double flash which had the SLboat_mod installed when I received it (now have the p0rtal openwrt version installed). Any help you (or anyone) could provide would be greatly appreciated.</p>									</div>
