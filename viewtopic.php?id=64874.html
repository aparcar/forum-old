					<p>I am using Wide DHCPv6 Client on my Machine. What i am trying to achieve sounds rather simple but I am facing difficulties <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> :- <br />1. I want dhcpv6 client to get Prefixes from my network using Prefix Delegation. <br />2. Once the client gets the prefix, i want it to assign 64 bit Network Prefix to the different ethernet interfaces.</p><p>While reading the following manual page on DHCPv6 Client configuration:<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/dhcp6c">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/dhcp6c</a></p><p>From this page i understood that &quot;sla_len&quot; in section below &quot;Specifies the site level aggregator length which is the difference of 64 and the delegated prefix size&quot;, e.g. /64 minus /56 from ISP = 8:<br />config &#039;interface&#039; &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;enabled&#039; &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;sla_id&#039;&nbsp; &#039;0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;sla_len&#039; &#039;8&#039;</p><p>Now the problem is that if i don&#039;t know the delegated prefix size before hand how can i hard-code the value of &quot;sla_len&quot;?<br />Is there a way to force client to automatically take the value of this parameter based on the delegated prefix size allocated by Server. For e.g. if DHCP server assigns /61 bit Prefix then this parameter automatically takes the value as 3 (64-61)? <br />Or alternatively is there a way to detect the delegated prefix length allocated by server before hand and then configure the Client accordingly?</p><p>OR AM i on a totally wrong track and trying to do something which is not a practical scenario ? If yes then how do the customer Edge Routers work?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sajalmalhotra</strong> on 17 May 2016, 06:55)</p>

					<p>Hmm, not sure. I do know that I have cascaded OpenWRT routers, each getting PD from the upstream source. So it would appear that you don&#039;t want to hard code sla_len, but I haven&#039;t looked into it. I was using Chaos Calmer, and frankly, it just worked.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your response. <br />&quot;I was using Chaos Calmer, and frankly, it just worked.&quot;<br />Can you share the DHCP client configuration that you used in your router?<br />Also, did you check what prefix length was being sent by the upstream source?</p>									</div>
