					<p>TL-MR3020, AA12.09, extroot 128MB on 1GB USB drive<br />Installed at a friends house, 120km away<br />No recent changes made that I could relate to this error.</p><p>- 3 weeks ago: powercycled for unknown reason (&quot;I thought there was something wrong and powercycling would help...&quot;)<br />- 2 weeks ago: I noticed that the data partition (data, not root partition) on the attached USB drive was mounted ro, instead of rw. I checked and fixed the errors, rebooted, everything OK and working.<br />- today: No connection to uhttpd possible; no ssh connection possible (putty: Connection refused);<br />Called my friend: $something is wrong, powercycle please.<br />Tadaaa: Everything working again... wait, no, after some minutes the same as above, no http, no ssh.</p><p>- waited some more and recognized: this error occurs intermittently, at irregular intervals, for irregular duration time. During this time, the MR-3020 can ping perfectly to the outside, but connections from the outside are rejected. After some minutes, it&#039;s working again... for some minutes.<br />- when trying to ssh, I get this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ssh: Couldn&#039;t set SO_PRIORITY (Bad file descriptor)
ssh: Exited: Error connecting: Connection refused</code></pre></div><p>Searching the net for &quot;Couldn&#039;t set SO_PRIORITY&quot; leads me everywhere but to a solution...<br />- an IP cam sending messages via ncat to the MR-3020 reports in the logs: &quot;Connection refused by host&quot;</p><p>I suspect it could be some error on the USB drive due to the previous power-cycles, but I don&#039;t get any mounting or filesystem errors in logread / dmesg for the root partition (and neither for the data partition). Both logread and dmesg are completely inconspicuous after booting and don&#039;t show any errors when the actual problem occurs.</p><p>I&#039;m kinda lost... any hints?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tmo26</strong> on 31 Oct 2014, 13:17)</p>

					<p>I suspect that when you are not able to connect via ssh it is due to Dropbear (the ssh server) not being able to access the file system or a particular file.</p><p>When you ssh to your router normally dropbear will fork a new process (with a new PID) which will open several files.&nbsp; If the new process can&#039;t open those required files I suspect it will fail.</p><p>If you install and use &quot;lsof&quot; you can see exactly which files a newly spawned dropbear opens.</p><p>This is only a hunch due to the error of Bad file descriptor but you could test it.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>What file systems do you have on your USB drive?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />I just wonder whether your USB drive is drawing too much power sometimes and is inaccessible.&nbsp; This would explain the previous power cycles.<br />Are you using a powered USB hub?</p><p>It might be worth doing a filesystem consistency check just to confirm there are no faults too.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sometimes, the solution is very simple...</p><p>Last thing I did yesterday: Write an email to my friend, asking if he had changed anything in his LAN. New devices, changed configs, ...</p><p>This morning he replied: Got an UHD TV yesterday... and manually configured it by mistake to the same IP as the MR-3020! :-D</p><p>4 hours of error searching wasted.<br />Anyway, happy that this issue is solved now! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
