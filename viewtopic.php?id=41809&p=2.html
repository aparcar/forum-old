					<p>OpenWRT seems quite well covered when it comes to IPv6 now so I can&#039;t really think of anything. DS-lite is next in line for testing here, will be interesting to see how it goes.</p><p>Noticed that in the webui, DHCPv6 lease time remaining usually stays at expired, perhaps due to clients not updating the leases though. What&#039;s missing perhaps is a way to control T1/T2, timeout for the leases.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>spock</strong> on 24 May 2013, 14:38)</p>

					<p>Apparently it was a bug in the lease-time handling, this should work correctly now as well.</p><p>Ah and thanks for your continues help with testing.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>CyrusFF</strong> on 24 May 2013, 15:35)</p>
