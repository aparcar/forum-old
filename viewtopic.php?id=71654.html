					<p>I just started whit my first OpenWRT on an old Asus Router. This router max runs OpenWRT10 so i installed that. Works fine.</p><p>My situation at home is that my internet provider gave me A fritzbox and and i&#039;m bound to it. Could set it to bridge-mode, but i don&#039;t have any connection account data (Password and stuff). And i think the OpenWRT defaults runs on NAT, so i would have a Double NAT. 192.168.178.x is the Fritbox network, and 192.168.1.x is the other one. </p><p>Now have just have some Machines in the Fritzbox network that i don&#039;t trust (Android, and some IoT stuff), on the other Network i Would like to have my Secure stuff (Computers, NAS and so on). Both have a Class C IP, so i simply could only Route the network in stead of NAT. Am i right?</p><p>Now i made a Portforwarding to reach the NAS from my Laptop (which is in the Fritzbox network, i don&#039;t have AP&#039;s in the other one), assuming it is on NAT mode. This works for the Web interface of the NAS running on Port 8080, but not for accessing the share trough AFP.</p><p>I was thinking, when I disable the NAT and simply use at Firewall whit some Routing table it should work. Or am i completely wrong?&nbsp; I had this stuff at School, but that&#039;s 20 years ago...</p><p>And some simple question. When running on NAT, how can I block internet traffic from some device (like the NAS), but not the traffic into the other network?</p>									</div>

					<p>If you disable NAT in Openwrt, then you need to add a static route in the fritzbox. The static route should contain your secure network as target and the IP of Openwrt as gateway.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>And some simple question. When running on NAT, how can I block internet traffic from some device (like the NAS), but not the traffic into the other network?</p></blockquote></div><p>You will need to add one or more firewall traffic rules. It may be enough to reject traffic from the NAS to address which don&#039;t match the other network. For example if the other network is 192.168.1.0-192.168.1.255 then use &quot;!192.168.1.0/24&quot; as Destination address in the rule.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the Reply. </p><p>I already found this: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/firewall">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/firewall</a> but there is so much info, and i don&#039;t be sure. Also found this: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=41214">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=41214</a> </p><p>So to be short: i have to edit: /etc/config/firewall</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config rule
        option src              lan
        option dest             wan
        option src_ip           192.168.1.2
        option target           REJECT</code></pre></div><p>But to reject all means that it also won&#039;t reach the other network at the WAN side. This network by the way, has range 192.168.178.0/24</p><p>But to be more secure I would like to allow only the IP address from the machines itself who would have access. Like my laptop having IP 192.168.178.23. Assuming the Laptop has a Fixed IP. </p><p>Should i make 2 rules? Like the one above to block everything and one like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config rule
        option src              lan
        option dest             wan
        option src_ip           192.168.1.2
        option dest_ip          192.168.178.23
        option target           ACCEPT</code></pre></div>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Roman78</strong> on 29 Jul 2017, 11:50)</p>
