					<p>I need to setup wps because it&#039;s the only method that my wifi printer supports to connect to a network.<br />My initial attempts through the push button method led to a factory reset, and after looking into the button scripts I found that this is triggered by &gt;5s pushing the reset button already. (Wiki says &gt; 30s)</p><p>So at the moment I am trying to stay away from the buttons (I can always configure them later, but this is not a priority) and configure this stuff from cli.</p><p>This is how far I got:</p><p>- Installed wpad (had to remove wpa-mini)</p><p>- Installed hostapd-utils (had to move /etc/rc.button/wps to /etc/rc.button/wps.bck for it to work, since removing package base-files seemed to scary to me)</p><p>- analysed the installed button script wps and looked into /var/run/hostapd/ which contained only one directory wlan0. So while the printer was telling me to push the wps button I ran <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@tplink:~# hostapd_cli -p /var/run/hostapd wps_pbc
Selected interface &#039;wlan0&#039;
OK</code></pre></div><p>Unfortunately the printer did not succeed to connect. </p><p>Please tell me what I can do to troubleshoot this.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have been able to add the printer to the network via USB connection using the install software. The solution feels wrong though, since I had to boot my computer into Windows to run the installation software. Which is an experience that neiter me not my computer is finding very enjoyable ;-)</p><p>As expected Windows crashed on me, but luckily it did so just a split second after transmitting the wifi settings to the printer :-)</p><p>Anyhow, if anybody knows how to fix my wps I&#039;d still be interested to learn.</p>									</div>

					<p>Try to add these lines to your wireless wifi-iface section in /etc/config/wireless file:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; option wps &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option wps_pbc &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option wps_config &#039;push_button&#039;</p><p>This should enable the wps_pbc in the temporal hosapd config file when restar the wireless daemons.</p>									</div>
