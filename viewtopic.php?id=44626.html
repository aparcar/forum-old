					<p>Hi!</p><p>I&#039;m working on a project with OpenWRT router.<br />Thing is next:<br />I have a router connected to some third-party device via serial port.<br />First I tried with router Linksys&nbsp; wrt54gl v1.1 + kamikaze, second serial port, device /dev/tts/1<br />Everything worked OK.</p><p>For communication I used a C-program. It was specially written for this communication protocol over serial, because the device on the other side is not configurable.<br />Then I switched to newer router, TP-Link WR741ND v4.22 + attitude adjustment&nbsp; / latest trunk (18.4.2013)<br />I changed next things:<br />1. Corrected the c-program to suit the new hardware: change /dev/tts/1 to /dev/ttyATH0 inside c source code for my communication program.<br />2. Cross-compiled my new c-source with new, appropriate mips-openwrt-linux-gcc from openwrt toolchain<br />3. in openwrt /etc/initab i deleted the row regarding /dev/ttyATH0, SO THE FIRST SERIAL PORT SHOULD BE TOTALLY FREE. (Am I right?)<br />(<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Linksys router had two ports. 0 was taken by the system, and 1 was totally free for my program.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; TP-Link has only one serial port, so I had to disable that one in order to use it.<br />)<br /># No other changes were made to c-program source code. Just the serial port.</p><p>And now things work really weird. It doesn&#039;t work.<br />I used oscilloscope, still saw that there are some signals at boot time. Bit that&#039;s another thing.<br />Later on, when openwrt boots I tried to send some data to serial pot via command:<br />echo Hello! &gt; /dev/ttyATH0<br />I was monitoring the serial port with oscilloscope and I saw that even though I was sending several times the same string, the signals on wire were all time different.</p><p>The thing is, that the same program work perfectly on Linksys router, second port. But it doesn&#039;t work on TP-link with one serial port.<br />The only difference is:<br />--&gt; changed appropriate serial<br />--&gt; compiled with appropriate ...-gcc</p><p>QUESTIONS:<br />1)<br />What can I do to totally free the first (only) port on Openwrt?</p><p>2)<br />Is there a way to disable those signals that i get at boot time on serial port? I know, that that is dangerous and that I wouldn&#039;t be able to save te router if bricked, but anyway... Those signals could harm my device on the other side of serial cable.</p><p>3) does anyone of you have (or know of anyone who has) an working example of program that communicates on a first port of openwrt-enabled router. I&#039;m curious of how have you initialized the serial port inside c-source.</p><p>On second thought, I&#039;m looking for any application that uses the first port, so port number 0, which is taken by openwrt system by default.</p><p>I&#039;m really looking for help. That problem has been bugging me for quite a long time and I&#039;m willing to pay a reasonable fee for help.</p><br /><p>Regards,<br />Peter</p>									</div>
