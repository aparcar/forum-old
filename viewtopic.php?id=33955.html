					<p>Hi!</p><p>Why are the only available channels in the pulldown-menu for 2.4GHz from 1 to 11 and in 5GHz only 36, 40, 44 and 48? How can I get the whole channel selection? Is this list country-selected?<br />With &quot;Germany&quot; I get only the above channels on 5GHz, with &quot;US&quot; I get extra channels 149, 153, 157, 161 and 165. But where are all the other in between?</p><p>On 2,4GHz I get only channels 1 to 11, regardless which country I&#039;ve choosed.</p><p>Seems to be an error?</p><p>Using trunk 29614 with Luci on WZR-HP-AG300H.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>naturelle</strong> on 7 Jan 2012, 02:06)</p>

					<p>The EEPROM of the unit is programmed with US regulatory domain, hence the missing channels 12 &amp; 13. Most of the 5 GHz channels require dynamic frequency selection (DFS) and transmit power control (TPC), which AFAIK are not yet supported in OpenWrt for mac80211 drivers. You can go around these restrictions by making your own regulatory.bin file (<a href="http://smorgasbord.gavagai.nl/2010/09/wifi-regulatory-compliance-and-how-to-fix-it/">http://smorgasbord.gavagai.nl/2010/09/w â€¦ to-fix-it/</a>).</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for the information. As I&#039;ve read in the comments of the article there&#039;s a switch in menuconfig to allow regdomain change for users. Why is this not activated in trunk?</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry, but maybe that this is the correct setting for US-users, but what&#039;s with all the others? EU, Japan? We have to compile our own version? That can not be the solution. Why do we have to subjugate under &quot;regulatory issues&quot; which are not our problem? I cannot understand that. The three missing 2,4GHz channels are really a problem in congested urban areas like here in NRW, and on &quot;a&quot; there are only four channels available. I am missing 52, which is allowed without DFS and TPC, too.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, I understand. So the only solution would be the above posted or self-compiling, am I right?<br />Is this an issue of the unit or is this a general issue in openWRT? In other words: if I would buy a Netgear or a Linksys or a Zyxel or something similar, would I step into the same limitations? Or are these limitations only given with Buffalo?</p>									</div>

					<p>It seems to be a general problem with (at least) Atheros based AP&#039;s. Making a new regulatory.bin file is really easy, though.</p>									</div>
