					<p>I&#039;m thinking of playing with trunk...not least of which because I&#039;m interested in the Buffalo WZR-HP-AG300H.</p><p>I know that there&#039;s a lot that becomes up to me if I&#039;m playing with trunk...enough so that I&#039;d kind of like to build it myself, so I can maintain what I end up using.</p><p>I&#039;ve done a build, but I had to guess at the configuration.</p><p>The backfire snapshots have a config file available: the trunk ones do not.&nbsp; Can a config file be added to the trunk snapshots?&nbsp; Also, maybe a note/text file/something indicating what SVN rev the snapshot was built from would be helpful...I&#039;m pretty sure the SVN version would show up if I actually flashed one of the builds, but I&#039;d kind of like to know what is was earlier, if I want to build it myself.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Kevin</p>									</div>
