But on the other hand, the more complex the device pages need to be. Really, one problem now, as I mentioned a while ago is that some very similar devices have different device pages (TP-Link WDR3600 and TP-Link WDR4300, for example), while some very different devices have the same page (TP-Link WDR4900 v1.X and WDR4900 v2.0).</p><p>I think we need to take some different &quot;pilot&quot; devices and try out different combinations of data entry and device page to see what works in practice.<br/>I was also quite close today to merge device lines that are extremely similar (where the difference between v1 and v2 is quite insignificant), especially in the &quot;unsupported&quot; and &quot;unknown&quot; area.</p><p>The good thing with the data entries is that they will not change much over time, so some redundancy between lines will be not such a big problem.</p><p>Perhaps we can, somehow, increase the model from<br/>&nbsp; - data entry<br/>&nbsp; - device page<br/>to<br/>&nbsp; - variant<br/>&nbsp; - data entry<br/>&nbsp; - device page</p><p>I think one advantage of splitting the three Zyxels up is that searching for one of them gets easier.</p><p>But this brings me back to my comment earlier about &quot;Discontinued and not possible to purchase&quot;... we will eventually need to focus our job on those 10-20% of devices that matter, and accept that the others will be more poorly documented.</p><p>Finally, if we could map &quot;images&quot; to devices that would be the absolute master to what devices are actually practically indentical and not. And perhaps our documentation should be based on images instead?</p>									</div>
