					<p>VPN instructions<br />------------------</p><p>This build supports three types of VPNs:</p><p> - <strong>OpenVPN</strong> (certificates)<br /> - <strong>IPsec IKEv1/strongSwan</strong> (username &amp; password + pre-shared key)<br /> - <strong>IPsec IKEv2/strongSwan</strong> (certificates)</p><p>1. Enable and start either the openvpn or the ipsec service, depending on which you&#039;d like to use. Firewall rules are already in place.<br />2. Download the appropriate configuration for your client.</p><p>Three client configurations are generated for you on first boot: &quot;phone&quot;, &quot;laptop&quot; and &quot;workstation&quot;.</p><p>OpenVPN client configuration: <a href="http://192.168.3.254/phone.ovpn">http://192.168.3.254/phone.ovpn</a><br />Note that OpenVPN Connect for iOS can only import from an e-mail attachment, so you need to send it to yourself.</p><p>strongSwan/IKEv2 on iOS client configuration: <a href="http://192.168.3.254/phone.mobileconfig">http://192.168.3.254/phone.mobileconfig</a></p><p>For strongSwan/IKEv2 on Android, you can download a p12 bundle like this: <a href="http://192.168.3.254/phone.p12">http://192.168.3.254/phone.p12</a><br />After importing, choose IKEv2/certificate in the strongSwan app and point it to your WAN IP.</p><p>For IKEv1, the default username/password is &quot;openwrt&quot; and &quot;changeme&quot; with PSK &quot;changeme&quot;. This can be changed in /etc/ipsec.secrets (then run &quot;ipsec restart&quot;). This configuration is supported natively on most operating systems.</p><p><strong>Question</strong>: &quot;I get a blank page trying to download the client configuration!&quot;<br /><strong>Answer</strong>: If there is no IP address on your WAN interface during the first boot you need to generate client configurations manually. Follow the below manual steps.</p><p><strong>Question</strong>: &quot;What about if I want to use a DDNS name instead of IP?&quot;<br /><strong>Answer</strong>: Follow the manual steps below to generate configuration.</p><p>For generating configurations manually, log in to your router with SSH and execute the following commands:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># vpn.sh buildserver 1.2.3.4</code></pre></div><p>Replace &quot;1.2.3.4&quot; with your WAN IP or DDNS name.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># vpn.sh buildclient myclient 1.2.3.4</code></pre></div><p>Replace &quot;myclient&quot; with the name of your client and &quot;1.2.3.4&quot; with your WAN IP or DDNS name. This step can be repeated for as many clients as you like.</p><p>If your WAN IP or your DDNS name changes you will need to repeat both the buildserver and buildclient commands.</p><p><strong>Tips &amp; Tricks</strong></p><p> * VPN traffic can be optionally sent through Tor, simply enable the &quot;Redirect-traffic-from-VPN-to-Tor&quot; rule in LuCI.</p><p> * Client configurations are generated under /www_blank on your router. You should delete them after downloading to your client, as they are available without any authentication.</p><p> * OpenVPN is set up with both UDP and TCP for better compatibility. The client configurations first try UDP port 1194, then falls back to TCP port 443.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>arokh</strong> on 26 Nov 2015, 16:15)</p>

					<p>No, I mean my previous builds were tailored to run all kinds of file services (AFP/SMB/FTP/NFS). I spent quite a lot of time making sure those worked out of the box. I could simply build with the same config, but that would not work automagically like before. I have simply no time or interest to play with those things since I am not using them myself anymore.</p>									</div>

					<p>I just updated to this build up from the older one, and it&#039;s working great so far (even the settings from the old build were successfully transferred over!).

					<p>Actually, Barrier Breaker supports native IPv6 by default.

Forcing probably works but I wouldn&#039;t recommend it. I&#039;m doing a new build now (r41150) which includes 6in4, 6rd, 6to4, the kmod-sit module and adds a bunch of other network support modules as installable packages.</p><p>Oh, and the reason you can&#039;t download lots of packages (including radvd which you don&#039;t need) is because the devs have moved the packages feed to github, and their build system is messed up atm not including oldpackages.</p><p>BTW, if you only did a sysupgrade from AA to BB I recommend that you wipe your configuration (reset button should work) and start fresh.

					<p>Can&#039;t include an ipk in the build, need the source package. Looks like it&#039;s included in the ticket, but why isn&#039;t it in the feed? I&#039;ll look at it later.</p>									</div>

					<p>I believe jumbo frame support passthrough for the WNDR3700 switch was included in OpenWRT a long time ago, should work already. Try this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>swconfig dev rtl8366s set max_length 3</code></pre></div><p>I could make it the default, but guess there&#039;s a reason it&#039;s not default already?</p><p>What OpenVPN client are you using? It works fine here. Like it says in the first post, the official Android app does not work with static keys. You need to use the &quot;OpenVPN for Android&quot; app by a third party.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>arokh</strong> on 13 Jun 2014, 17:33)</p>
