					<p>Hi Kontrozi,</p><p>The chroot is quite simple, all it does is, it changes the root &#039;/&#039; to point somewhere else. So doing a chroot /mnt/c you will not see anything above /mnt/C anymore. If /mnt/C does not contain anything you are in a limited shell with no commands at all. So you have to but essentialy all the binaries like &#039;ls&#039; or &#039;cat&#039; or &#039;bash&#039; into a subdir /bin. ftp has been using this for security.</p><p>I remember a slackware scrtipt for &#039;usermode linux&#039; getting a limited but complete slackwaretree into a subdirectory. I will post a link when i find it. </p><p>For now i have just copied a small set of files from a linuxmachine into /mnt/C</p><p>then the /mnt/C/autoexec contains only this:<br />#!/bin/ash</p><p> umount /mnt/D<br /> killall smbd<br /> killall nmbd<br /> chroot /mnt/C /rc.local</p><p>The rc.local is an executalble shellscript under /mnt/C and contains something like:</p><p>#!bin/ash<br />&nbsp; mount /dev/hda2 /iTunes # this is my big 39 Gig partition containig all itunes<br />&nbsp; nmb&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; smbd&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # Start samba 3 which is in /mnt/C/bin and /mnt/C/lib<br />&nbsp; mt-daapd&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # shares itunes in the network<br />&nbsp; rpc.portmap<br />&nbsp; rpc.nfsd<br />&nbsp; rpc.statd<br />&nbsp; rpc.lock </p><p>&nbsp; etc.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;# to start nfs </p><p>This essentially is it.

					<p>Hi Biro,</p><p>i will try to get rid of the keyboard things, it&#039;s however not allways obvious which option to disable in the kernel to not loose other things to. <br />The thing with the upgrade is not quite true - it&#039;s a complete firmware. All i did was changeing the firmware in a way to make it usable for me. If i would have had enought time i would have changed the http pages as well, but i do not see a reason for this at the moment. If you have a nice layout with some nice generic menus we can &#039;rebrand&#039; it to some open things. The http part is not to difficult and it would be easy to add a http tree with initial link under eg. /mnt/C/http</p><p>Niknak</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi there<br />today I tried the different firmwares. <br />I installed the conceptronic firmware V 07 on my SMC device and it worked very good. I liked the spin down feature very much.<br />Next I installed the Level One Version V 08 (without changing any header)&nbsp; Unfortunately after this there is no response from the device anymore. <br />This is what I tried so far<br />I tried a reset without success.<br />I Hooked it up to a pc but no IP Adress is given<br />I hooked it up to a router but it is not accessible.<br />originaly I started W-Lan but it works any longer (no SID or light in the display)<br />Any Ideas how to flash it back?

					<p>A general Questions I couldn&#039;t find anything about this on the web. How much memory Chroot uses? <br />I use the usb Image of Pagano for testing on my HD.<br /> It works ok, but I often run out of memory (it seems to mee) because telnet sessions crash always, no more samba service. The only thing that still works is the http service. unfortunately the reboot function is not functional. Is this a consequence of the chroot? Finally the power supply is the only way to get the system back working. <br />You encounter the same?<br />Would it be possible to turn on swap space?<br />Would this prevent the HD from spin down?<br />I also tried the uclib image pointed out by pagano in vmware. Beside the mount command all worked ok for me ( I needed to add a -o loop at the end) to mount the file to d<br />Unfortunately I couldn&#039;t find the genrated bin file. Any advice where I can find it would be helpful.<br />Another problem I encountered was: how to get this file on the device?<br />Anyone tried to get the compiler &quot;installed&quot; on the device?

					<p>Hi kontrozi, <br />No, I just following gentoo howto<br />I started from here <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=1&amp;chap=5#doc_chap2">http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/h … #doc_chap2</a>, because we already have linux installation, so we dont need to configure partitions, ..etc<br />We dont have links, or lynx on our device, so I just downloaded stage3 from gentoo mirror and unpackedd it<br />Also you need to download portage package<br />As busybox can untar bz2 images, i bunziped it first, then untared. I dont know, what went wrong, but i get Segmentation fault when untaring<br />But hopefully, I was able successfully chroot into this partly untared gentoo, so I untared it once more time with gentoo tar <br />Then, I exited chroot, and mount proc and dev<br /># mount -t proc none /mnt/C/gentoo/proc<br /># mount -o bind /dev /mnt/C/gentoo/dev<br />and chrooted again<br />I changed profile to 2.4 (check Code Listing 8 of howto)<br />we dont have mirrorselect tool, so I copied this lines from another gentoo machine<br />I used emerge-webrsync to update my tree - it takes a lot of time...<br />I have not changed any variables in make.conf and have skipped kernel part - we already have one<br />we also need our original fstab and resolv.conf, so i copied them</p><p>thats mainly all, now I just chroting into gentoo after system reboot (I dont want to make any automatic scripts yet just in case something goes wrong with gentoo)</p>									</div>
