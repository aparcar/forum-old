					<p>I need to test the bandwidth capability of a Router for troubleshooting reasons. It appears the Router is chocking on higher bandwidth downloads as this was suggested for me to try this. I never had need to do this before and have little idea other than the basic re-cabling connections.</p><p>Situation;<br />Two Towers, both running Win 7 Pro; I&#039;ll call the WAN side PC A, the LAN side PC B<br />MB&#039;s have the same AMD 970 chipset, one tower has a AMD FX8350, the other has a AMD FX6300<br />Router is a TP-Link TL-WDM3600 (Gigabyte) running openwrt firmware<br />Both are in the same room (for convenience) with 6&#039; Cat5 (or 5e) cables.</p><p>Other than setting &#039;Network Properties&#039; of the PC B to Auto, what addresses do I set PC A to?<br />What and where do I change in the Router as to addresses and DHCP settings? <br />Should this be a DHCP Client or a Static address?<br />What else do I have to address oin the Router?</p><p>Lastly; am I accessing each PC via a web browser or just by &#039;Explorer&#039; like I would normally?</p>									</div>
