					<p>Hi,</p><p>a customer contacted me with a problem (see attached JPG) where in a VLAN environment our wifi product doesn&#039;t work. since I do not have all the equipment as described in the JPG I was wondering if I could recreate the environment using a LAPTOP (currently installed with BACKTRACK 5) and an AP (currently loaded with openWRT). </p><p>if anyone could get me started with a general &quot;what to do&quot; and &quot;what to read&quot; to get it done, so I can then start debugging our code to see where the problem lays, i&#039;d appreciate it. </p><p><a href="http://postimage.org/image/r8amclw3v/"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://s9.postimage.org/r8amclw3v/NANO_Wi_Reach_VLAN_ISSUE.jpg" alt="http://s9.postimage.org/r8amclw3v/NANO_Wi_Reach_VLAN_ISSUE.jpg" /></span></a></p><p>thank you. </p><p>Daniel<br />Connect One</p>									</div>
