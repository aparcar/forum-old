					<p>any progress on this? i am one of those people who have never built my own openwrt but i can definitely flash a router given the initramfs image, i am currently in another country for 1 month and took a cheap tplink 150mbps travel router with me and its really terrible with speed and distance. i have my wmr-300 but no way of flashing it without an initramfs image or a step by step on how to make one. its really a capable unit i hope someone can post it or do a tutorial on how to buil it at least. my decision on buying it was based on the fact it was supported so i thought it would be an easy download and flash but i was wrong.</p>									</div>
