					<p>I found McWRT a week ago after the stock firmware would not let me set unique DNS; McWRT fixed my problem and is working great.</p><p>I am now getting into the details of McWRT and WRT1900AC and of course learning as I go. In doing so I noticed a couple of minor cosmetic issues that are not affecting functions but that I would like to see corrected for the user usability that I think will attract many more WRT1900AC users to McWRT.</p><p>Most of the minor stuff I can live with i.e. Led status etc. but the Wireless Status problem as noted in <a href="https://github.com/Chadster766/McWRT/issues/11">https://github.com/Chadster766/McWRT/issues/11</a> is irritating as it is the heart of a wireless router function. Again, not a show stopper, just annoying.</p><p>Just wondering when we could expect a fix to this issue or is it much more complicated than I appreciate?</p>									</div>
