					<p>Please forgive me if this is the wrong place to post this, but I think the wiki relates to documentation quite directly.</p><p>The currently used version of MoinMoin on the OpenWrt wiki is outdated (judging by the available syntax because the /SystemInfo page causes a 500 error) and actually broken (I keep getting a 500 error each time I save a page). The latest stable version 1.6.3 promises to have additional anti-spam tools (<a href="http://moinmo.in/MoinMoinRelease1.6">http://moinmo.in/MoinMoinRelease1.6</a>), which that should be a good incentive to upgrade. If there is no manpower to do the upgrade in the OpenWrt dev. team, I would like to suggest asking the MoinMoin community. I know of at least one person in #moin on irc.freenode.org who would be willing to do the upgrade if asked.</p><p>On a related note: Has there been any progress with the following since 2007?: <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=59428#p59428">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=59428#p59428</a></p>									</div>
