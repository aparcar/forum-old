					<p>I&#039;m looking at the following use-case:</p><p>drop a bunch of me-controlled powered OpenWrt across a landscape.&nbsp; At one end of the landscape is a&nbsp; node that is not-me-controlled but connected to the Internet and offers a secured WPA2 node.</p><p>All the OpenWrt nodes connect (mesh? what is the correct name?) to each other and at the far end I connect to any one of the me-controlled nodes and enter the correct WPA2 password for the not-me-controlled Wifi node.</p><p>Think of it as camp:&nbsp; The camp office has a wifi node and a password and it&#039;s known.&nbsp; I&#039;m way out of range for that node.&nbsp; I want to drop wifi nodes in cabins along the way, and I want them to automagically connect together and, even when I I&#039;m on the far end, I want to enter the camp password and have that pass along the mesh, and now I&#039;ve got (repeater, repeater, repeater, kinda slow) internet.</p><p>The wifi units I&#039;m using are Western Digital MyNet 600.&nbsp; Maybe slow, but both 2.5 and 5 GHz radios.</p><p>I&#039;ve got a few months to figure this out - any suggestions?</p>									</div>

					<p>yes, but it depends from the hardware, and of course bandwith may suffer.</p><p>you need to look for tutorials about &quot;VAP&quot; (virtual access points), it is the wireless equivalent of VLAN. I have no idea if openwrt has the drivers for this, but it is possible.</p><p><a href="http://superuser.com/questions/155795/can-a-linux-machine-act-as-both-a-wireless-client-and-access-point-simultaneousl">http://superuser.com/questions/155795/c â€¦ ultaneousl</a></p><p>Given your needs, I&#039;d suggest to get a kinda overpowered directional antenna like a yagi, or repurpose an old sat-tv dish (or use a wok pan), but if the place isn&#039;t yours you might break local laws.</p>									</div>

					<p>You may want to look at a RouterBoard, which is a router in a high power dish antenna to cover the distance rather than hop by hop by hop. I understand you can run OpenWRT on it, as well.</p><p><a href="http://routerboard.com/RBSXT2nDr2">http://routerboard.com/RBSXT2nDr2</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Just thinking out loud, with dual radios could you alternate them as bridge and AP interfaces, e.g.</p><p>[WAN-(2.4GHz_AP)] --&gt; [(2.4GHz_Bridge)-Device1-(5GHz_AP)] --&gt; [(5G_B)-Device2-(2.4G_AP) --&gt; etc.</p><p>You could set your own SSID and password on the devices you control, and use non overlapping channels for the 2.4GHz radios.</p>									</div>
