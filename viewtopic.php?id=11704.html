					<p>Hi Everyone,<br /> Sorry if this is the wrong place to post it. I&#039;m working on the implementation of a MAC+PHY layer protocol which requires me to be able to change the timing of RTS/CTS and ACK packets(for example delay the DATA packet by 1 slot time instead of SIFS after a CTS is received). <br />I tried this with the madwifi driver but found out it is not possible to dictate the transmission of control packets from the driver.<br />From my understanding, these packets are transmitted by the firmware/hardware (I&#039;m not sure which).<br />Is there a way to do this in using openwrt or by modifying it? </p><p>thanks in advance for any help.</p>									</div>

					<p>You are talking in MAC/PHY level of access....<br />With openwrt or any other firmware, you wont <br />be able to do it because not a single chip manufacturer <br />give access to that info unless you sign a NDA..</p><p>Openwrt has some functions to play with ACK, but <br />(they are there) not working .......</p><p>Atheros released only binary file of the MAC/PHY <br />driver to open source community.....</p>									</div>

					<p>On Broadcom-based devices most of the MAC layer is handled by the firmware which is loaded on the wireless card during boot. You can try a 2.6 kernel, the b43 driver and the open source BCM firmware, you should be able to do it.<br />You can find the open firmware and documentation about it at <a href="http://www.ing.unibs.it/openfwwf/">http://www.ing.unibs.it/openfwwf/</a></p>									</div>
