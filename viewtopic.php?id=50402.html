					<p>Actually, what I find way easier is to set up an sftp-server on your device and then connect to it with your pc&#039;s usual file manager (in Windows that would be explorer). That way you can edit the sript in the standard editor that you are familiar with (or use something like notepad++ as syntax-highlighting is a really nice thing ;-) ).</p><p>All you have to do is install the sftp-server by typing (in putty if that&#039;s your ssh-client [sorry, I&#039;m a linux user])<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># opkg update
# opkg install openssh-sftp-server</code></pre></div><p>Then you can connect to your device by opening the path sftp://192.168.1.1 (or whatever your devices ip is) in your standard file manager using your ssh-credentials (user: root, pw: your_root_pw) to log in. Now you can access the devices file system the way you use your pc&#039;s file system.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Elchi</strong> on 1 May 2014, 16:25)</p>
