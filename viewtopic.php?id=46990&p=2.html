					<p>Many thanks to nebbia88, FriedZombie and all others involved.</p><p>FriedZombie - You said &#039;eth0.3 means that I would have a tagged vlan on eth0 tagged vlan3&#039; - I have done the following, can you see if I have missed anything:</p><p>1) Via LuCI interface I created a new wireless network named VLAN3 and also created a new network interface named eth0.3 . I am assuming that any packets going through that wireless network VLAN3 SSID would be sent with tagged packets with VLAN ID 3</p><p>2) Secondly I then attached my machine to the VLAN3 SSID</p><p>3) Tried to route traffic once connected to the VLAN3 SSID</p><p>4) Found that the packets transmitted whilst connected to VLAN3 SSID did not contain the VLAN ID 3 in the header</p><p>Oddly in the&nbsp; /etc/config/network file all I see is as below which does not seem to make any reference to VLAN 3. </p><p>Can anyone see if I have missed anything?</p><p>In addition can anyone confirm if the default eth0 management interface will be sent with tagged or untagged packets? I would ideally like the default management interface to appear as an untagged VLAN with a VLAN ID of 520.</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p><p>config interface &#039;loopback&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;lo&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;127.0.0.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask &#039;255.0.0.0&#039;</p><p>config globals &#039;globals&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ula_prefix &#039;fd37:afbb:e668::/48&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option type &#039;bridge&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ip6assign &#039;60&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;172.16.22.13&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask &#039;255.255.255.192&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option gateway &#039;172.16.22.1&#039;</p><br /><div class="quotebox"><cite>FriedZombie wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Thank you all for the great responses <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Also I have stuck together some images based on trunk r39025 + patches, this image contains the webgui (Luci) and zram_swap</p><p><a href="http://ooxion.com/openwrt/wax50re/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wa901nd-v3-squashfs-factory.bin">openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wa901nd-v3-squashfs-factory.bin</a> (to flash trough the tp-link default webgui)<br /><a href="http://ooxion.com/openwrt/wax50re/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wa901nd-v3-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin">openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wa901nd-v3-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin</a> (to upgrade an existing openwrt installation)</p><p>Also the wireless is enabled by default on this image.</p><p>@pwilson411<br />Yes it is possible to do the setup that you want under openWrt, only the switch tab doesn&#039;t show up because the switch isn&#039;t used/connected on the wa901nd. But you can simply create new interfaces for example eth0.3 means that I have a tagged vlan on eth0 tagged vlan3.</p></blockquote></div>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pwilson411</strong> on 19 Dec 2013, 20:17)</p>

					<p>I can confirm that upgrade from stock firmware for WA-901ND (v3) to openwrt using web interface work without any problem. Today i do that.<br />Firmware is this posted by FierdZombie: <a href="http://ooxion.com/openwrt/wax50re/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wa901nd-v3-squashfs-factory.bin">openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wa901nd-v3-squashfs-factory.bin</a><br />In my nwtwork i have one ap wr-1043ND (with dd-wrt latest revision) that act as router and two wa-901ND as repeaters for extending wireless network. One is on stock firmware and another is with openwrt.<br />Configuring wa-901nd as repeater is not dificult, but what i see is that at both repeaters are connected at TX rate by only 1M, and RX 54M (is use g standard for moment). Tests speed over internet confirm that.<br />Shure is not something wrong with openwrt because the other one is connected as same speed.<br />In this stage i don&#039;t know if is some problem with wa-901ND, or with WR-1043ND or maybe with dd-wrt firmware.<br />If fact i put openwrt on these AP to see if can do some hack to resolve that. If someone have suggestion, or encountered this situation and can offer some suggestion or tweeks I would be very happy. I want to mention that encryption is off.<br />Thanks to this ambitious community for his work!!!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vlad2005</strong> on 21 Dec 2013, 18:31)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m back with results.<br />First I can find an easy way to run iperf on dd-wrt. So I change dd-wrt on my router with openwrt. Now everything seem to be ok. Connection between ap and sta show rate about 120M both on rx and tx with about 20 meters between ap and sta and two walls. This make me happy <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> . With sta in proximity of ap separated by one wall i have 300M / 270M. So is excellent. <br />Tests with iperf show rate about 23Mbps from sta to ap and 43Mbps from ap to sta (with sta in working pos) ion ). This is much better from what i have until now. My conclusion is that dd-wrt have some problem with wr-1043nd. Anyway, openwrt look much better. Tons of good documentation, a lot of packages, active form. Probably need more tutorials using web gui. I know that this is not ideal because web interface can change, but people seem to be intimidates by work using console.<br />I have a little question. On wa-901nd(4M flash memory), i have occupied half on total space. Need to be careful with some growing files like logs?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vlad2005</strong> on 22 Dec 2013, 17:51)</p>

					<p>Well if you mean the logs, that can be read with logread. Not really since they are loaded in a ring buffer in ram.<br />If you mean actual files, you could save them in /tmp/whatever , but keep in mind that it is a volatile storage also in ram. it could still fill up the ramfs partition but you then could simply declog the router by restarting it.</p><p>If you store them elswhere on the device, it will go into the overlays/jffs2 partition and that could potentially clog up the system.</p><p>Also I&#039;m thinking about creating a youtube channel dedicated to openwrt, people seem to appreciate videos more then written stuff.

					<p>It&#039;s a very good idea with youtube because is faster than make capture and write things!! And seem to be well appreciate by users. Not need to much. Basic router setup with nat, wds, qos. This is basic for most people. For advanced users, they can read documentation and post on forums.</p><p>Thanks again!</p>									</div>
