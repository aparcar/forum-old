					<p>Hello All,</p><p>I have a fon 2100 running Kamikaze trunk.&nbsp; The problem that I am having is that it will not boot with the serial port attached to any device.&nbsp; I have removed the serial console from the kernal so this is not the issue, in fact this is before that is loaded anyway.</p><p>What is happening is that if the fon gets shutdown with the serial attached it will not boot again, its like redboot is trying to init something. If i remove the serial connection from the fon then power cycle it again it will boot.&nbsp; If i unplug the serial , shutdown the fon , plug the serial back in , then power up the fon it works. </p><p>This is a pain as it makes it so the fon can not be rebooted remotely or of it looses power it locks up on boot.&nbsp; Any idea&#039;s how to get around this?&nbsp; Can you disable serial access in redboot?</p><br /><p>--Jason</p>									</div>
