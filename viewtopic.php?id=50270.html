					<p>Background: I have had the following question for soooo many years being a network engineer (although I&#039;ve been out of it for a few now) but never knew anyone to ask. So here goes....</p><br /><p>Question: Why does the following not either exist, or someone is working on it? OR....tell me that it does, and where to look....</p><p>What: A &quot;private internet&quot; that offers free WiFi to all, and has access points....well, where it does.</p><p>What I mean: Why can&#039;t I setup a wireless router with a Linux OS (such as your OpenWRT), and then get several thousand other people to do the same. THEN....make &quot;some software&quot; that becomes a client for Windows/Apple/Android that lets you hop from connection to connection Seamlessly. Think: A Free 4G connection, just like I have on my VZ Android phone. Meaning, I should be able to hop around Any wireless routers in NYC that Overlap and where we&#039;re all running X client.</p><p>Now, I assume this wouldn&#039;t work if you were say streaming a video, or logged into a secure site. But, it could work if you were just browsing the web. And maybe it could indeed work for the former if someone figured that out. </p><p>Thoughts? Am I crazy here?</p><p>Caveat: Since I&#039;m extremely new here, I&#039;m sure I&#039;m missing something. So just tell me to delete this and I will.</p>									</div>

					<p>LOL<br />There are *tons* of implementations of this.<br />Also, this is literally the ONLY REASON why ISP&#039;s are now virtually ALL pushing modems with integrated router/wifi-ap. Its because they share a wifi connection to everybody who happens to come within range.</p>									</div>
