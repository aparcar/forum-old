Maybe some ARM systems.</p><p>One of the developers did say in a talk once that they would be looking into the possibility of HW NAT in the future, but who knows when/if that might happen. </p><p>I think the upcoming generation of routers with dual core ARM chips may get us there without HW NAT.</p></blockquote></div><p> How about one of those MikroTek routers? I&#039;m guessing they should at least be more stable than consumer routers.

My reasoning now is basically that I have to suck it up and accept running the stock firmware on the router. For that reason, I&#039;m now looking for the most stable device that can deliver good throughput. My experience with consumer routers says that that is usually not the consumer products. The EdgeRouter Lite scored less than 800 Mbit/s of throughput in one direction and the 5 port version is quite a bit more expensive than the Mikrotik considering you seemingly get less throughput from it. Maybe newer firmware versions have upped those values though. Also, it probably delivers in the stability department.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>blunden</strong> on 3 Sep 2014, 00:21)</p>
