					<p>Please bear with me, I&#039;m new to OpenWRT....</p><p>I have a lovely UBNT AirRouter that i would like to put OpenWRT onto.&nbsp; I looked in the Wiki and Table of Hardware but it was unlisted (not a single reference to it).&nbsp; </p><p>However, I was poking around and I found what looks like a build for Ubiquiti AirRouter here.&nbsp; </p><p><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/</a></p><p>Does this meen there is a valid build for AirRouter?</p><p>If so, would it be an Alpha/Beta or stable release (for the AirRouter hardware)? </p><p>It appears there aren&#039;t any open bugs for it.&nbsp; <a href="http://patchwork.openwrt.org/project/openwrt/list/?state=*&amp;q=airrouter&amp;archive=both">http://patchwork.openwrt.org/project/op … chive=both</a>&nbsp; </p><br/><p>If it is a good build, Are their any special install instructions or is it the TFTP install for other UBNT devices?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Adam</p>									</div>

					<p>First I installed DD-WRT easely, didn&#039;t like activation (20 euros), put OpenWRT on. A bit scary, it doesn&#039;t respond at first, but you reset it once more and it is done. I have a feeling that AirRouter will be my favorite router. It couldn&#039;t NAT thru full 100Mbps with AirOS or DD-WRT, but it did 91Mbps. Now need to rest, will continue trolling later <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile"/><br/>If I am not mistaking, I used <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/</a> … actory.bin</p><p>P.S. Serial port is working, tried with old Siemens mobile phone cable.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve just installed&nbsp; the latest trunk over AirOS on the AirRouter and it works perfect.<br/>While the ath9k driver from OpenWRT doesn&#039;t expose the radio scanning capabilities (afaik) that the AirOS closed source driver does, and might not have some of the options... OpenWRT is way better.</p><p>Note that AirOS&#039;s driver doesn&#039;t even work properly with some of the options anyway, and Ubiquity doesn&#039;t seems concerned (been very long , no patch, no comments).</p><p>So yeah, OpenWRT is superior in every other way.</p><p>Installation is dead easy, just go to the&nbsp; AirOS upgrade page and select the OpenWRT firmware - done.<br/>That&#039;s the one I use: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-ubnt-airrouter-squashfs-factory.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … actory.bin</a></p><p>Once it rebooted, wired network will be up (incl. WAN DHCP) and you can telnet to it (192.168.1.1) then set a root password (passwd), and reconnect via ssh.<br/>See the OpenWRT documentation to set it up (mainly, edit /etc/config/wireless and comment out the &quot;disabled 1&quot; line to enable wifi.. then again check doc to get WPA2 AP, default is no encryption, channel 11, SSID OpenWrt).</p><p>You can use the sysupgrade image and again, OpenWRT doc to upgrade.</p><p>Important note: while I use trunk (the dev version) you might want a stable version. I haven&#039;t tested the stable release - but it probably works too.</p><p>Anyhow, that&#039;s that <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile"/></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kang</strong> on 1 Apr 2012, 10:58)</p>
