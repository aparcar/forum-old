					<p>I am currently in India, and decided to buy a cheap wireless router and found the iBall Baton Wireless-N. It is ok for its price, around 1300 Rs. But after used it for my purposes I decided to do some examinations and found out that it is just a rebranded TP-Link TP-WR741 and I decided to try OpenWrt. With just a few small changes it worked straight out of the box with the version for WR741. </p><p>I share here the modified file if you don&#039;t want to do the modification yourself. </p><p><a href="https://rapidshare.com/files/2306044709/iBallBaton-iBWRX150N-OpenWrt.bin.zip">https://rapidshare.com/files/2306044709 â€¦ rt.bin.zip</a></p><p>What is changed is at 0x44 to change to 00360001 and fixed the checksum (using fixsum).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Superhai</strong> on 8 Jun 2012, 01:15)</p>
