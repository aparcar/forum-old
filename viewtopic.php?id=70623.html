					<p>Hello,<br />Please forgive for my lack of technical proficiency and my poor English.</p><p>I have just bought a Linksys WRT1900ACS V.2 router and I have installed OpenWrt firmware. Everything seems ok, but I cannot find an option I liked a lot in the original Linksys firmware: the possibility to limit access to router through the ethernet connection only.</p><p>To avoid any misinterpretation, with &quot;router access&quot; I mean access to router management only: the WiFi network is fully operational but you must connect to the router through a cable to change any setting.</p><p>I have been navigating the OpenWrt LuCI GUI extensively but I could not find any feature similar to Linksys&#039; firmware. This is a significant security issue for me, so any help would be highly appreciated.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p><p>Bustrofedico (Italy)</p>									</div>

					<p>Is the password not enough protection for you?</p><p>The default configuration for OpenWRT bridges the wired and wireless interfaces into a sigle LAN network; it is not <br />possible to segregate wired and wireless access to the router configuration, unless you undo the bridge and configure separate networks. This can be a problem in some circumstances.</p>									</div>
