					<p>@Sam<br />received my 703n today and the setup was a breeze. Pretty much blindly followed your instructions and it worked like a charm. Awesome job on the firmware!</p><p>Trying to troubleshoot an issue unrelated to the firmware. Looking for your linux audio expertise here. Now my setup has mpd running on x86 with local alsa and openwrt-pulseaudio outputs. I see that the lead-lag is random. sometimes alsa lags, which is a little weird. Any idea how I can rectify this.</p>									</div>

					<p>@s7mx1<br />I am looking forward your next release.But I would very much appreciate it if you release the pulseaudio package with correct config include usbaudio.<br />Because I want install 703n to my wifi-car with UVC or 301 camera and stream audio function.</p><p>We all know the 703n has just 4M rom,which is so small for those softwares.<br />So I intend to boot my 703n from a tf card.I still cannot understand how your pulseaudio work...<br />When I flashed other trunk firmware from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/</a> with Luci webgui and opkg install pulseaudio-daemon kmod-usb-audio,the pulse seems unload anything,no sinks,no modules,even it cannot run...<br />Unless I input command pulseaudio -nC,entered the command line mode,there is a module-CLI loaded</p><p>Now I can stream audio from Windows box to 703n,of course 703n with your Pulseaudio Firmware.<br />Here is my default.pa file<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#

Nothing will happen if you try to connect it to your pc straight. </p><p>If you are able to enter fail safe mode and want to change settings or reset to default you can follow this&nbsp; reference: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe</a>.</p><p>Basically you log into the router via telnet and then issue the following command:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mount_root</code></pre></div><p>At that point you will be able to modify any settings by hand but if you prefer to reset them to defaults you can do so by<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mtd -r erase rootfs_data

Just to let you know what I have been working on these day. I am currently setting up mpd and pulseaudio on the same WR703N. This is achieved by installing mpd ( and mp3 files of course)&nbsp; on the nfs share. What I can say is it has no problem at playing back mp3 files which is being re-sampled by mpd from 44.1k to 48K and then streamed back to pulseaudio locally (hardware only capable of 48K) for playback.&nbsp; The CPU usage is about 35% during playback.</p><p>It looks like you can retire your laptop soon and replace it by one WR703N + your NAS. The above test is done locally however I don&#039;t see any problem for mpd to stream to any pulseaudio server on the network.</p>									</div>

I&#039;d suggest being patient when you&#039;re soldering as the pads really are minuscule, I used enameled copper wire (and scraped the enamel off, then tinned a short amount), use the finest iron tip you have (I just about managed with a 1mm tip, which is crazy, because it was about twice the size of the pad -- not recommended!).
