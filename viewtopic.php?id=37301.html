					<p>Hi!</p><p>I have two TP-Link WR741ND routers, and I&#039;ve put Openwrt on them. How do I get them to speak together over WDS? I&#039;m just a beginner with OpenWrt. It says something about them being atheros, but I don&#039;t know what that means.. <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds</a></p><p>I only know how to use the web interface, and I have put this on both of them:<br /><a href="http://imgur.com/UcEh8">http://imgur.com/UcEh8</a></p><p>One of them is 192.168.1.1, and the other one 192.168.1.2</p><p>What else should I do?</p><p>Janko Mihelic</p>									</div>
