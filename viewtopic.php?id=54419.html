					<p>I have a TPLINK wdr4300 V1.1 using 12.09. Some time ago all its lan ports have stoped work, but I keep it working with transmission + flexget over wireless. Yesterday I tried to update to the 14.07, but I forget that the precompiled images does not activate the wireless feature by default. So now I can&#039;t acess my router. I think that I can connect with a RS232 (serial) that I already have, but I don&#039;t know if I can activate wifi or even how to. Do my router can be saved? Or is just some paperweight now?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi </p><p>If you are connecting over com port you should be able to edit and enable wifi in etc and if packages are required you should be able to scp them to the box then install them.&nbsp; </p><p>You can turn on wireless by editing the /etc/config/wireless file changing disabled 1 to disabled 0.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ret</strong> on 5 Dec 2014, 16:21)</p>
