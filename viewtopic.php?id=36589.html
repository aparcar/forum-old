					<p>Hi All</p><p>I have a basic knowledge of networking (I understand ip addresses, subnets etc but not much more) but am a Linux novice and totally new to openwrt.<br />I have loaded openwrt on to a TP-Link wr1043ND without too much problem. I managed to install nocatsplash as well, but that is where I hit a brick wall. I couldn&#039;t work out how to configure it and before everyone shouts, I spent hours searching before posting on here.</p><p>We want to provide free WiFi to the 4 holiday cottages we run. I have no problem setting up the hardware, but I need a captive portal to ensure the customers read the T&amp;Cs.</p><p>What is the easiest way to do this without too much command line stuff. I am happy to learn some if necessary however. preferably I would like to be able to use my own HTTP page as well (but not vital).</p><p>Thanks in advance</p><p>Paul</p>									</div>

					<p>There is a package called LuCI (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials</a>) which gives you a nice GUI interface for your router.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks. Lucie was installed by default and I have been accessing the router using the GUI.<br />Problem was that after installing nocataplash I couldn&#039;t find anything to configure to set it up.</p>									</div>
