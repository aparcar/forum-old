					<p>Hello,<br />I have the following scheme:</p><p>1. Huawei HG510 connected to ADSL network via cable. It is configured in bridging mode (This device is pretty bad and it starts to drop packets when heavy-loaded in router mode). If someone connects directly to it with static 192.168.0.x IP address, he can access web interface at 192.168.0.1. </p><p>There is a cable connected to LAN1 port of this modem and WAN port of the another device.</p><p>2. The other device is DIR825 with openwrt firmware. It initiates PPPoE connection to my internet provider and starts DHCP server, so all devices connected to it via cable or via wifi receive some IP address (10.0.0.x) and access to internet.</p><p>Everything works well except the fact that sometimes my ****ing provider drops connection until the modem is rebooted (maybe problem is in the modem itself, nevermind. The thing is in fact that I need to reboot modem when internet goes down). I wanna write simple shell script which will check internet every minute and will reboot modem if it needed.</p><p>But to do that I need an access to modem&#039;s web interface from the router (it would be great if I will have access to it from any device in 10.0.0.x network). Unfortunately when pppoe is connected I lose access to it. I tried to configure interfaces some times, but I couldn&#039;t make both connections (to internet and to modem) available. Could you please explain how should I configure /etc/network, routes and firewall?</p><p>Thanks in advance, Grief from Russia.</p>									</div>
