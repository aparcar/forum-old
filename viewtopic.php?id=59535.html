					<p>Hi All</p><p>I have a TP Link Archer C7 AC1750 v1.1 and whilst flashing OpenWrt, the power cable was accidentally pulled out...</p><p>As a result, my router now seems to be stuck in an endless boot cycle. The power and &quot;snowflake&quot; icons are always lit. All four LAN icons flash on and off (with nothing connected). The WAN led and update LEDS also flash slowly. </p><p>I have tried to De-brick using TFTPd32 and the following firmware</p><p>-OpenWRT<br />-TPlink (with boot section removed - <a href="http://www.friedzombie.com/tplink-stripped-firmware/)">http://www.friedzombie.com/tplink-stripped-firmware/)</a><br />-TPlink with boot section removed by myself</p><p>TFTP server set to 192.168.0.66. There is LAN activity when the reset button is held down after power on. I can connect to any of the LAN ports and the firmware file is pulled from the TFTP server. Wireshark shows that all blocks of the firmware are transferred during the TFTP session, however, this does not fix the router. It is still stuck with all lights flashing.</p><p>I have also tried to access the router using RS232. However, the router does not respond to any commands. On power on it simply returns [00]. I used an FTDI chip USB to serial adaptor plus termite.</p><p>Any ideas on how to proceed?</p><p>Any help would be great. Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi. Thanks for the reply.</p><p>I&#039;ve read the links and tried the failsafe boot with no luck. I did work out that my TX and RX lines were crossed. After correcting this, the router is talking over serial but it is all garbage. </p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/605/21321021142_d691f9dab8_b.jpg" alt="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/605/21321021142_d691f9dab8_b.jpg" /></span></p><p>any ideas? I&#039;ve read that this could be a poor GND connection. I have checked it several times. I&#039;ve also tried different baud rate settings. Flow control is switched off.</p><p>Any ideas?</p><p>Thanks again.</p>									</div>
