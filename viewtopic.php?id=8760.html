					<p>Hiya guys, </p><p>I was wondering if anyone could help me. i managed to install OpenWrt on my new and shiny 500gp router (After discovering it doesnt support PPPoA and USB Modems) and im up to configuring the unit. After stressing out, trying to connect it to my current belkin router (silly mistake as i had mac filtering on) and doing some tweeks to OpenWrt, i have to configure it to play nice with my USB Modem.</p><p>I&#039;ve already done some research, and ive found out that some people have got it working with mobile phone modems and other modems but they dont have any info on how to do it exactly.</p><p>So if any one can point me in the right direction or even point out the right packages needed, i would be really greatful.</p><p>Heres my current setup:<br />Asus WL-500g Premium (currently onnected to my belkin router for internet access)<br />Speedtouch 330 USB ADSL Modem<br />external Laptop hard disk drive (not yet installed or plugged in)</p><p>thanks in advance</p><p>agent_paul</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>agent_paul</strong> on 27 Dec 2006, 23:57)</p>

					<p>Although it might not be needed as you plan on using an USB connection to connect to the internet I would advice you to set some variables in nvram to get the device working as planned. This to avoid problems due to configuration differences in the WL500g Premium. </p><p>From the wiki:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>nvram set vlan1ports=&quot;0 5&quot;
nvram set wan_ifname=vlan1
nvram set lan_ifnames=&quot;vlan0 eth2&quot;
nvram set lan_ifname=br0
nvram commit</code></pre></div>									</div>

					<p>Hi 500gx, thanks for the reply. i saw those modifications in the wiki too, but was only going to do them once i found out more about them.</p><p>i see that you have a 500gP too, what packages do you have on it atm? are you running it with bin, micro or pptp?</p><p>regards</p>									</div>

					<p>On my WL500g Premium I am running X-WRT, a set of packages and patches to enhance the end user experience of OpenWrt. Basically it is RC6 (bin version) with a new webif (web interface). I am still working on setting up this unit. I am trying some new methods of using USB storage as the basic filesystem has changed in between RC5 and RC6. I have posted a question on this forum about that. Basically it will be set up similar to my WL500g Deluxe. Have a look below for the package I use on a WL500g Deluxe which is a completely similar device.</p><p><strong>WL500g Premium, more or less fresh RC6</strong><br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ipkg list_installed |sort

					<p>Hi Weedy, i read that thread before i posted this one. there were a couple of thing i was unsure of from it but other than these i was ok with it.</p><p>1. the ipk packages are not available list the list when i type ipkg list even after running ipkg update(also not available on the website packages dir).</p><p>2. using the downloaded zip file containing these packages, i have no idea how to copy them onto the router itself. i&#039;ve tried ftping to it and that doesnt work...</p><p>i&#039;ve gone through the wiki and cant find anything on manually installing ipk files. i see that you posted in that thread too. did you get it to work successfully? hows the performance?</p><p>regards</p>									</div>
