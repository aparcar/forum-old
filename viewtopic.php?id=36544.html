					<p>Hi,</p><p>I already found <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=32659">this thread</a> dealing with the same topic. But there the discussion drifted away and no solution seemed to be found.</p><p>I have an openWRT Backfire 10.03.1 connected to the internet using a UMTS-modem. This I want to connect to my Fritzbox at home, accessible via DDNS. What I understood is that setting up a tunnel between the two routers won&#039;t work since the UMTS-end is hidden behind a NAT thus having no public IP. Which seems to be required on both ends as far I can see from AVM&#039;s configuration tool. (Maybe there&#039;s a possibility to change this manually the cfg-file?)</p><p>So setting up the openWRT-side as client seems to be the only solution; with some sort of static routing - maybe even an individual VPN-connection for every client in the openWRT-LAN. This should be no issue at all, since we&#039;re talking about only one or two clients at the remote network. If the clients could run their own VPN-client, there would be no issue at all. Unfortunately they can&#039;t.</p><p>This setup being not one of the scenarios usually published in howtos or similar cookbooks, I&#039;m a little bit lost. Setting up a new user on the Fritz-side (and updating the cfg-file so that it works for an iPhone&#039;s IPsec) is no problem at all. But what to enter in the config-files on the openWRT-side?</p><p>Any hint to setting up openWRT simulating an individual VPN-client is greatly appreciated. </p><p>TIA,</p><p>Gero</p><p>PS: here&#039;s a small illustration. I want to make the device A part of the FritzBox-LAN (doing this for A-C would be site-site link which seems not to be supported through UMTS-NAT) </p><p>A------|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |----openWRT &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;INTERNET&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; FritzBox |---(and the LAN behind it)<br />B------|&nbsp; &nbsp; (behind UMTS-NAT)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(with DDNS)<br />C------|</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your reply. Now I&#039;ve found some time to dig me a little deeper into the topic, I&#039;m stuck again.</p><p>From my understanding the /etc/config/racoon file is parsed by /etc/init.d/racoon and a final config file is written to /var/racoon/racoon.conf, a place in the ram-disk to prevent too much wear and tear of the flash-memory.</p><p>Somehow the resulting racoon.conf file looks a little bit incomplete:</p><p>[edit: issue solved, see my post in the other thread]</p><p>Thanks again,</p><p>Gero</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gero</strong> on 19 May 2012, 22:12)</p>

					<p>Hmmm, now that I read the debug-output &quot;my interface: 10.161.xx.xx (3g-wan)&quot; I&#039;m somehow concerned. This is a private IP address behind a NAT. Also, the main difference between the fritzbox-specific config-file and the published example seem to be using hostnames rather than constant ip-addresses. But I only have one DDNS-hostname - the one on the Fritz-end. The other end of the tunnel is behind the NAT of my 3G-provider. That&#039;s why I was looking for an IPsec client on the openwrt router rather than creating a VPN-tunnel.</p><p>What I would like to achieve is to have the openwrt router connecting to my Fritzbox as a &quot;Roadwarrior&quot;. i.o.w., the openwrt router playing the role of the Roadwarrior&#039;s laptop. Of course, this is not a very common configuration, since the real Roadwarrior plugs in his 3G-Modem directly into the laptop rather than going over an additional router in between...</p><p>But on the other hand this configuration is similar to connecting a mobile phone over VPN to the FritzBox and then switch on the mobile hotspot (aka tethering) on this phone. </p><p>Is this a viable configuration option within openwrt?</p><p>Gero</p>									</div>

					<p>If you read <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.ipsec.site2site">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.ipsec.site2site</a> it should be clear that working with identifiers (my_identifier=bratwurst) rather than IP addresses will allow OpenWRT to act like a roadwarrior. Therefore you have to build a dynamic endpoint configuration on the central side. So it does not care about the IP of the connecting VPN device (like Shrew Client on a laptop or racoon on OpenWrt):</p><p>Examples for a dynamic configuration are:</p><p>Netscreen: dynamic IP address + peer id = bratwurst<br />Fritzbox: remoteid { fqdn = bratwurst }</p><p>Markus</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your confirmation. I just saw the NATed IP-Address in racoon&#039;s log and the DNS-error that &quot;remote.tld&quot; can&#039;t be resolved. Putting in my DDNS fqdn did resolve this, but I still was unsure whether such a config is possible, since fritzbox did not complain neither about the name &quot;remote.tld&quot; nor &quot;local.tld&quot;. But you&#039;re right, openWRT did not complain about the local &quot;bratwurst&quot;, so from this side it didn&#039;t look bad at all. In contrary to the fritzbox side, where I haven&#039;t seen any reaction after starting racoon so I was unsure whether such a uncommon &quot;client&quot;-setup is supported at all...but I still need to go on with the firewall rules...</p><p>Thanks for your support</p><p>Gero</p>									</div>

					<p>remote.tld may be confusing somehow.</p><p>you either use IP addresses for phase 1 handshake (a real static side to side tunnel) or both partners must use a common identifier. mabye the example would be easier to understand if configuration example had been defined like this:</p><p>openwrt dynamic raodwarriror side:</p><p>config &#039;tunnel&#039; &#039;WN&#039;<br />&nbsp; ...<br />&nbsp; option &#039;enabled&#039; &#039;0&#039;<br />&nbsp; option &#039;remote&#039; &#039;gatway.acme.com&#039;<br />&nbsp; option &#039;my_identifier&#039; &#039;whatever_you_like&#039;<br />&nbsp; option &#039;my_identifier_type&#039; &#039;fqdn&#039;</p><p>fritzbox (somehow dyndns) static side:</p><p>connections {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; enabled = yes;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; name = &quot;roadwarror&quot;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; remoteip = 0.0.0.0;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; remoteid {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fqdn = &quot;whatever_you_like&quot;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...</p><p>Markus</p>									</div>

					<p>That&#039;s right, &quot;remote.tld&quot; sounds like a resolvable DNS-name as &quot;local.tld&quot;. With the values you just posted the example is less confusing. Also, it&#039;s more clear that &quot;roadwarror&quot; is just a descriptive text and has noting to do with the actual configuration which is done by matching &quot;whatever_you_like&quot; on both ends. (btw: Is it compulsory, stating &quot;localid { fqdn = &quot;gatway.acme.com&quot;}&quot; as the local end on the fritzbox-side? Anyways, I specify it for now to avoid potential errors)</p><p>Gero</p>									</div>

					<p>Phew, firewall configuration is really a beast. The published script /etc/racoon/firewall v12 doesn&#039;t work for me. I did create a zone &quot;vpn&quot; in LuCI and let the script run. Some entries in iptables were generated, but the &quot;rules&quot; didn&#039;t change. From the description I would assume creating the zone is a must, the rest is done by the script. Anyways, when creating a rule manually in LuCI, (lan:0.0.0.0:* &gt; vpn:192.168.1.2:*) Fritzbox reports an established VPN-connection. However, no data has been transfered so far - I think here some more deep-diving in the firewall rules is necessary. Too bad. I would have loved it working out of the box ;-)</p><p>Another strange thing: When I reboot the router, the 3g-wan interface comes up correctly. But shutting the interface it down and restarting it, results in having the lan&#039;s IP assigned also to the 3g-wan interface. It seems to be related to the firewall rules. Any ideas on this? btw: which command is executed when clicking on &quot;Connect&quot; and &quot;Stop&quot; on the Interfaces tab?</p><p>Gero</p>									</div>

					<p>Already mentioned in other posts /etc/racoon/firewall only compensates LUCIs inability to handle VPN networks (with no real interfaces). It reorders the rules so that everything works smoothly. It DOES NOT open the firewall to remote VPN sites. The steps involved are:</p><p>- define a zone VPN<br />- create /etc/racoong/firewall and put a link in /etc/firewall.user<br />- define your firewall rules with web interface (that makes the packets pass)</p><p>Markus</p>									</div>
