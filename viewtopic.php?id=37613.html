					<p>Hey all, I am running Arokh r32429 at the moment in combination with MiniDLNA. Now the thing is, some MKV&#039;s get updated and shown through the MiniDLNA server on my TV and Windows 7 PC, but some MKV&#039;s just get ignored for some weird reason. I have checked the MKV&#039;s and they all should be compliant, does anyone know what I can do to solve this?</p><p>EDIT:<br />The files MiniDLNA doesn&#039;t recognize, do get recognized by Windows 7 Media Player DLNA server and my TV runs those files without a hitch, so, it can&#039;t be the files themselves.</p><p>EDIT2:<br />If I delete the db file that MiniDLNA makes at first and disable/reenable MiniDLNA through Luci, then it does recognize these files. I have the inotify box checked, so that can&#039;t be it, but it has definitely something to do with the scanning and updating the minidlna DB file.</p><p>EDIT3:<br />This is from the logs:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>[2012/06/19 22:47:07] minidlna.c:977: warn: Starting MiniDLNA version 1.1.0-cvs.<br />[2012/06/19 22:47:07] minidlna.c:366: warn: Creating new database at /mnt/sda1/.minidlna/files.db<br />[2012/06/19 22:47:07] scanner.c:708: warn: Scanning /mnt/sda1/TV_Series<br />[2012/06/19 22:47:08] minidlna.c:1020: warn: HTTP listening on port 8200<br />[2012/06/19 22:47:26] scanner.c:775: warn: Scanning /mnt/sda1/TV_Series finished (6 files)!<br />[2012/06/19 22:47:26] scanner.c:708: warn: Scanning /mnt/sda1/films<br />[2012/06/19 22:47:26] scanner.c:775: warn: Scanning /mnt/sda1/films finished (7 files)!<br />[2012/06/19 22:47:26] playlist.c:125: warn: Parsing playlists...<br />[2012/06/19 22:47:26] playlist.c:256: warn: Finished parsing playlists.<br />[2012/06/19 22:52:37] metadata.c:754: warn: Opening /mnt/sda1/TV_Series/Alphas.S01E02.720p.HDTV.x264-ORENJI.mkv failed!<br />[2012/06/19 22:52:37] scanner.c:532: warn: Unsuccessful getting details for /mnt/sda1/TV_Series/Alphas.S01E02.720p.HDTV.x264-ORENJI.mkv!<br />[2012/06/19 22:52:37] metadata.c:754: warn: Opening /mnt/sda1/TV_Series/Alphas.S01E02.720p.HDTV.x264-ORENJI.mkv failed!<br />[2012/06/19 22:52:37] scanner.c:532: warn: Unsuccessful getting details for /mnt/sda1/TV_Series/Alphas.S01E02.720p.HDTV.x264-ORENJI.mkv!</p></blockquote></div>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>johan81</strong> on 19 Jun 2012, 23:58)</p>

					<p>Be reminded that, even that mkv is in compliant format, different muxer may generate slightly different in the header.<br />And different system, different player, different codec may also have different level of recognition.</p><p>In my case, all mkv are playable in my PC, but some mkv can&#039;t be recognize by the dxva although it is h264 encoded video...<br />My TV able to play mkv video directly too,<br />but, some can&#039;t play in correct framerate, some can&#039;t play in correct aspect ratio, and some unplayable.<br />with transcode, everything play fine.</p><p>So, you may remux those unrecognized mkv again to correct some problems.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I am certain it is a bug with MiniDLNA, I made a script named &quot;refresh&quot; and put it in the bin folder with the following code:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>#!/bin/sh<br /># Copyright (C) 2006-2011 OpenWrt.org</p><p>killall minidlna<br />sleep 5<br />minidlna -R -f /var/minidlna.conf</p></blockquote></div><p>This refreshes the db file, after that all added mkv&#039;s I have added are recognized. If you have a large library this will be a hassle, though in my case (I use it mainly to watch TV shows that come out here so darn late) I only have 15 files on it tops. So, every time I have unrared an episode of something downloaded with transmission, I run the refresh script and voil√°! I can stream it on my TV.</p><p>While this works and isn&#039;t that much of a problem in my case, I still think it is a bug with the package. Though I might be wrong of course <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>johan81</strong> on 20 Jun 2012, 16:02)</p>
