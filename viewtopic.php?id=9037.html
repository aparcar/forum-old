					<p>I have been using OpenWRT on some Linksys and Buffalo routers with sucess.&nbsp; I am very excited about OpenWRT and its functionality.&nbsp; <br />What I have a desire is to have a device that runs OpenWRT or some other linux that is small and cheap.&nbsp; I do not need wireless functionality in some cases, but VPN (OpenVPN).&nbsp; I have a Buffalo Wireless router that I have installed at a client and taken off the antena (because they do not want any wireless devices).&nbsp; Not only for this client, but in other applications, I just want a device that has an ethernet port or two and runs Linux, is small, and runs roughly around $50&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>									</div>

					<p>you have 2 options, i have set up my router to not include the wifi in the bridge (my wlan is eth1)&nbsp; so my lan_ifname=br0 lan_ifnames=vlan0 (i have openvpn running on tap0 in bridged to br0).&nbsp; once you have pulled the wifi interface out of the bridge you can do an ifconfig eth1 down and bring the interface down.</p><p>the other option is to break the bridge and require an openvpn connection over the wifi to access the wired side of the network.</p>									</div>
