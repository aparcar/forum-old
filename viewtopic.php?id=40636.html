					<p>I am experiencing a similar problem. I have an RB750UP and I am using Attitude Adjustment 12.09 r36088 (latest stable release).</p><p>I applied the following patch:</p><p><a href="http://patchwork.openwrt.org/patch/3252/">http://patchwork.openwrt.org/patch/3252/</a></p><p>I also added an intentional compiler error to &quot;/target/linux/ar71xx/files/arch/mips/ath79/mach-rb750.c&quot; to ensure the change was getting compiled.</p><p>And then re-built:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># make</code></pre></div><p>But it looks like the change is not being built.</p><p>How do I get this change to build? I.e. how do I rebuild with the change I made to &quot;mach-rb750.c&quot;?</p>									</div>
