					<p>I&#039;ve had this happen a few times now, where my Spectrum cable modem doesn&#039;t seem to be renewing the DHCP lease.&nbsp; I&#039;m forced to restart the cable modem.</p><p>I&#039;m going to open a case with Spectrum to check the logs on their side, but just wonder if anyone else has seen a similar issue and resolved it already?</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;wan&#039;

					<p>If you are running OpenWRT on your Spectrum cable modem, then ensure that the firewall configuration allows incoming DHCP Renew responses from the DHCP server.</p><p>You&#039;d find these configs from /etc/config/firewall.</p><p>If you are running OpenWRT somewhere else, and the Spectrum cable modem is a DHCP client to this server, then it&#039;s possible that the Spectrum cable modem&#039;s DHCP client is malfunctioning, in which case you&#039;d need to contact their support to fix it.</p>									</div>
