					<p>Hi,</p><p>during configuration of my WNDR3800 device i tried several releases of openwrt.<br />I need asterisk which seems to be broken in latest trunk and attitude_adjustment rc1. First because of a dns resolving issue. Second SIP register doesn&#039;t work properly. Incoming calls are not received.</p><p>Here are instructions to improve the functionality of asterisk in the 10.03.1 because there are also issues:</p><p>1. Integrated sounds playback fails<br />the sounds folder of asterisk seems to be compiled in as /var/lib/asterisk/sounds/ whereas it is placed in /usr/lib/asterisk/sounds in openwrt.<br />You can fix this by adding this line in /etc/init.d/asterisk <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[ -h /var/lib ] || ln -sf /usr/lib /var/lib</code></pre></div><p>at the beginning of the start() block.</p><p>2. Endianness bug of WAV audio<br />The version of asterisk in 10.03.1 is affected by this bug<br /><a href="https://issues.asterisk.org/jira/browse/ASTERISK-18739?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Achangehistory-tabpanel">https://issues.asterisk.org/jira/browse … y-tabpanel</a></p><p>This makes voicemail unusable because playback of recordings fails.</p><p>You need to recompile the asterisk package of 10.03.1 with the patch provided in the above bug report<br /><a href="https://issues.asterisk.org/jira/secure/attachment/41476/format_wav.patch">https://issues.asterisk.org/jira/secure … _wav.patch</a></p><p>Hope this helps anyone</p>									</div>
