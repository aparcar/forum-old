					<p>hi there</p><p>as i&#039;m currently developing a package for openwrt (some accounting hacks) i use vi very often. the thing which is getting more and more annoying is that i have to do a</p><p>:set tabstop=2</p><p>each time i start vi.</p><p>with vim i have the possibility to create a $HOME/.vimrc or $HOME/.exrc (or by setting the EXINIT env variable) where i can setup such standard-commands and vim loads these settings each time it starts.</p><p>is there a chance that vim comes into the new versions of openwrt or does anyone know if the vi installed on openwrt supports such a startup-script-file?</p><p>which editors do you use for editing .php/.c/.sh/source files?</p><p>regards, armin.</p>									</div>

					<p>I use vim for everything I edit outside of the WRT but the &quot;vi&quot; command included with OpenWRT is actually part of the &quot;busybox&quot; binary. If you didn&#039;t know, busybox is a Swiss army knife of commands designed to give as much functionality in as little space as possible so it will be light on features. So I believe it would be a question for the busybox developers if that functionality could be added in or create a separate vi/vim package (vim requires a lot more space). <a href="http://www.busybox.net">http://www.busybox.net</a>/</p>									</div>
