					<p>Hello,</p><p>For better or for worse I bought my kids Galaxy tabs for xmas.<br />I have created a &#039;kids&#039; wifi ssid, and I&#039;m using OpenDNS to apply some content filtering.<br />However, sometimes I just want to disable wifi completely.</p><p>I was wondering if it wouldbe possible to write a script which blocks the tabs using macfilter IF a specified MAC is connected.<br />For instance, if I connect my phone to that wifi ssid, then macfilter is disabled.&nbsp; If I&#039;m not connected, then macfilting is on and their MACs are denied.</p><p>Seems I can use uci to set the filter up<br />uci set wireless.@wifi-iface[0].maclist=hh:hh:hh:hh:hh:hh hh:hh:hh:hh:hh:hh<br />uci set wireless.@wifi-iface[0].macfilter=deny<br />uci commit<br />wifi</p><p>How can I test to see if a specific MAC (or any in a list), is connected?<br />Also, is there a connect event I can use to run a script?</p><p>Thank you</p>									</div>
