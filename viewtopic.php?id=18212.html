					<p>I am looking for a router that is currently supported by OpenWrt and likely to be supported still in the near future. I would like it to have at least one detachable antenna. 802.11n and 802.11n 2.4GHz and 5GHz would be nice even if OpenWrt does not fully support compatibility with that yet. Any suggestions?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ben_b</strong> on 27 Dec 2008, 16:12)</p>
