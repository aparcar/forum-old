					<p>Hi,</p><p>let&#039;s assume an Atheros OpenWrt device (madwifi-ng driver) in wireless station mode. While the AP to connect to is properly configured via uci and a connection attempt is initiated, OpenWrt sometimes fails to successfully associate with certain configured APs. To investigate this, upon connection attempt, I used iwconfig to verify the current connection status and I hereby noticed that OpenWrt hops channels although the channel of the AP is obviously locked/defined via uci (see below). Is there an opportunity to get rid of that behaviour? The AP of interest certainly is in range upon connection attempt and hopping channels, in that particular situation in managed mode, seems to be rather counter-productive to me. <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>uci set wireless.wifi0.channel=11
