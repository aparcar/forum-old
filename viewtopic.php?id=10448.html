					<p>The is no VNC package for OpenWrt.&nbsp; If your device is still performing it&#039;s intended task as a router/firewall then a VNC server (or anything X11-related) is considered a security risk.&nbsp; Also, most of these devices are extremely limited when it comes to storage space and RAM, so the X11 libs, etc would just consume more space.&nbsp; There are very small X-servers (tinyx, Xserver, etc) but they don&#039;t have much purpose on a little headless 200mhz MIPSel router.</p><p>If you just want to keep CLI apps going when you aren&#039;t connected to the router, take a look at screen, or it&#039;s lighter cousin, dtach.&nbsp; They both do exactly what you want, and screen has many more features for managing multiple terms/sessions, etc.</p>									</div>
