					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I am quite new to the OpenWRT world, and it is quickly growing on me.<br />I installed OpenWRT on my Linksys WRT1900ACSv2. I need some help to set up my OpenVPN server. I successfully started an OpenVPN server on port 1194 UDP, but due to some firewall restrictions (when I connect to a certain network) I need to set up another on port 443 TCP. The problem is that it would interfere with luci, since it also runs on 443 TCP.</p><p>I read that openvpn does support the option &quot;port-share&quot;, which would do exactly what I need, allowing me to reroute luci traffic on, say, port 4443.</p><p>But, trying to put the option in the openvpn config file I get a syntax error. I am using openvpn-openssl of course. Is it not supported? Is there any way to enable this option? How can I contact the developers of openvpn-openssl to ask for assistance on the matter?</p><p>Alternatively (and complementarily), could I simply change the port on which luci listens to, say, 88? Then I should probably be able to access the luci page from web browser by specifying the port instead of using the htps protocol.</p><p>Any advice? It would be extremely appreciated.<br />(If anybody needs any clarification I would be happy to comply, I simply thought the question is general enough)</p><p>EDIT: more appropriate title</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>abovethecloud</strong> on 13 Aug 2017, 16:00)</p>

The problem is exactly that I want the OpenVPN server running on port 443 with protocol TCP. The issue is in fact the conflict with the uht*pd server which allows the luci access from the web browser on port 443 TCP (ht*ps, indeed).</p><p>The openvpn config file that I set is:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config openvpn &#039;myvpntcp&#039;

Though, I can&#039;t seem to find documentation in this regard. I don&#039;t know who I might contact to ask.<br />The only page I found mentioning the port-share option in the context of OpenVPN on OpenWRT is this: ht*ps://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/package/network/services/openvpn/Config-openssl.in, but I don&#039;t know what to do with that.</p><p>NOTE: as above, substitute &#039;*&#039; with &#039;t&#039; where appropriate.</p>									</div>

Actually, I think I understood this concept, since what I wanted to do was exactly that: let OpenVPN listen on 443, uht*pd on 4443, and redirect non-VPN traffic on port 443 towards port 4443 (for uht*pd to listen).<br />Though, you are right to say that I got something wrong, since:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>eduperez wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Try using &quot;port_share&quot; instead of &quot;port-share&quot; in the config file; if I read the code correctly, the init script will revert it back to &quot;port-share&quot;.</p></blockquote></div><p>This actually solves the syntax problem! Thank you very much! But now the OpenVPN instance doesn&#039;t start anymore (so, it does recognize the syntax and the option but there is some error preventing it from working - not only the port share option, the whole VPN server won&#039;t start).
