					<p>Hi all,<br />I successfully compiled knockd 0.7 source (<a href="http://www.zeroflux.org/projects/knock">http://www.zeroflux.org/projects/knock</a>) with Attitude Adjustment toolchain. This included compilation of libpcap and knockd itself.<br />To compile I leveraged the original configure/make scripts in the tarball (ie. ./configure -host=mipsel-openwrt-linux-uclibc --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu).</p><p>output binary works, but it&#039;s definitely oversized. using stripping, I cant make it smaller than 280kB. Original knockd package (version 0.5) available on openwrt repository is way smaller, around 30kB. And if I compile the same source for x86, it&#039;s around 30kB as well. <br />Now the question is: what am I missing to reduce binary size in case of crosscompiling version 0.7? I tried to play with -O options in makefile, but still can&#039;t go lower than 280kB. I&#039;m no compilation/x-compilation expert, is there anything I should optimize on libpcap as well? any other hints?</p><p>thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>After further investigation, the problem seems to be libpcap libraries. In fact, if I compile knockd source using libpcap library included in Openwrt SDK instead of compiling it myself, the knockd binary size drops to 100kB, which turn into 40KB with stripping.</p><p>But there is a trade-off. I wanted to move away from knockd-0.5 version readily available with opkg in openwrt because it consumed 4MB+ of RAM at runtime, and I thought the last version, 0.7, would have been more efficient.<br />If compiled with openwrt SDK libpcap, 0.7 behaves exactly the same. When compiled with self-compiled libpcap, the biary is bigger, but the RAM footprint is way lower, although still big (2MB instead of 4MB+).</p><p>So in my scenario I&#039;ll do as follow: I&#039;ll keep the self-compiled 280KB binary and make it available on a webserver, fetch it from there and store it in RAM, launch it and then delete it.</p><p>just in case anyone hits the same issue <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />cheers</p>									</div>

					<p>wow it worked, thanks!! I don&#039;t know how to force usage of dynamic libraries but just removed libpcap.a and created a softlink libpcap.a-&gt;libpcap.so. <br />now the only issue remaining is that when I run that binary on the ar7 box it says &quot;can&#039;t load library &#039;libpcap.so.1&#039;&quot;. <br />In lib directory there is libpcap.so.1.1 and libpcap.so.1.1.1 instead. <br />any hints about how to tell the binary to look for libpcap.so.1.1 instead of libpcap.so.1?</p><p>thanks a lot</p>									</div>

					<p>That is usually achived by symlinks, they&#039;re usually laid out like this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>libpcap.so   -&gt; libpcap.so.1
