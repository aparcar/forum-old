					<p>How far have you gotten with this so far?</p><p>The wiki here <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/ubiquiti/unifiac">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/ubiquiti/unifiac</a> shows that it can be modified using an ssh session + mtd, although this didn&#039;t work for me after the reboot so I had to open mine up.</p><p>It&#039;s going to be close to impossible to open it without keying the surface, but otherwise you can do it, and the points that are marked would be normally out of view (but unlikely to pass this off under a warranty claim).</p><p>Since mine is dead (got my VCC and 3.3v confused on my adaptor/wiring) I have yet to put it back together so will upload pictures in a moment to show the clasp points.</p><br /><p>As a tool I like to use old credit cards which I cut into 4 and use the curved corners to help hold the case open. I first try to push open a gap with my hands but since its round and the edges are sharp (I actually cut myself twice FYI) I needed to use a precision screw driver to get the first wedge in, once you have one in get another in beside it and slide it as far as you can, generally this will be the point you need to release, you can push another wedge in along this and usually once you have popped one you can move to the next one easily.</p>									</div>
