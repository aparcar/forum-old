					<p>OpenWrt includes a &quot;failsafe&quot; mode, which is generally enabled via holding a button on your router. </p><p>I would recommend this as a potential fix for your situation if it is available to you.</p><p>Failsafe mode will have the router accessible over all default LAN ports via the original 192.168.1.1 IP Address.</p>									</div>
