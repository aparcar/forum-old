					<p>Hello all! I recently built a mini-ITX box with 2 ethernet adapters and a Wifi card to be my new router, and I decided to try out OpenWRT on it. Unfortunately, I&#039;m a Linux newb and having trouble getting OpenWRT to recognize my wifi adapter.</p><p>Side note: The ASRock user manual with my motherboard claims my Intel wifi adapter is a 3160, but my dmesg calls below imply that it is actually a 3168. I don&#039;t know how to verify which it is, so I&#039;m operating under the assumption it is a 3168.</p><p>I have both the iwlwifi-firmware and kmod-iwlwifi packages installed, but I noticed in my dmesg call I&#039;m seeing:</p><p>[&nbsp; &nbsp; 4.059581] iwlwifi 0000:03:00.0: Unsupported splx structure<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 4.060290] iwlwifi 0000:03:00.0: Direct firmware load for iwlwifi-3168-21.ucode failed with error -2<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 4.061193] iwlwifi 0000:03:00.0: Falling back to user helper<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 4.062712] firmware iwlwifi-3168-21.ucode: firmware_loading_store: map pages failed<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 4.064457] iwlwifi 0000:03:00.0: Direct firmware load for iwlwifi-3168-20.ucode failed with error -2<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 4.065356] iwlwifi 0000:03:00.0: Falling back to user helper<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 4.066933] firmware iwlwifi-3168-20.ucode: firmware_loading_store: map pages failed<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 4.067727] iwlwifi 0000:03:00.0: no suitable firmware found!</p><p>I tried to downgrade to a firmware 21, but got the following error instead:</p><p>[&nbsp; 223.084474] iwlwifi 0000:03:00.0: Unsupported splx structure<br />[&nbsp; 223.116403] iwlwifi 0000:03:00.0: uCode file size 9205943 does not match expected size<br />[&nbsp; 223.117360] iwlwifi 0000:03:00.0: Direct firmware load for iwlwifi-3168-20.ucode failed with error -2<br />[&nbsp; 223.118258] iwlwifi 0000:03:00.0: Falling back to user helper<br />[&nbsp; 223.119744] firmware iwlwifi-3168-20.ucode: firmware_loading_store: map pages failed<br />[&nbsp; 223.120564] iwlwifi 0000:03:00.0: no suitable firmware found!</p><p>Since that failed, I&#039;ve been looking for how to grab a more recent driver, since the one opkg install pulls is 4.4.14, but the iwlwifi site says 4.6+ looks for firmware 22. Unfortunately, this is where I run into problems, since drivers seem to be a bit more work than just download and unpack in the correct directory.</p><p>In short, I&#039;m looking for 1 of 3 things:<br />1) Short tutorial on installing a driver from outside a package repository (or installing a driver from a non-standard repository).<br />2) Modifying the current driver to use firmware 3168-22<br />3) Finding the correct downgrade firmware my current driver is looking for.</p><p>I did a quick search for Intel wifi driver problems in the forums, but didn&#039;t see anything like this. Thanks for taking the time to read my wall of text.</p>									</div>

					<p>First, what version of OpenWRT are you using? Did you build it yourself or did you download it from somewhere?</p><p>Second, what model is your motherboard? Regarding the wireless card, you could open up the ITX case, and see if you can locate and identify it beyond doubt.

You can consider sending a support request to ASRock, since by providing a possible motherboard revision number / serial number it is possible to receive the most accurate information. Different revisions of the board may have different hardware.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>samuel.harkness wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I&#039;m not following you on this point, or maybe I&#039;m not understanding the error logs correctly. Is the last number in the .ucode file not the version of the firmware?</p></blockquote></div><p>It is. In your log output, the driver is attempting to load firmware versions 21 and 20. Now, in the iwlwifi home page, there&#039;s the following quote:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p><strong>7260, 3160, 7265, 7265D, 3165 and 3168 support</strong></p><p>Those devices will not be supported by the newest firmware versions: the last firmware that was released for 3160, 7260 and 7265 is -17.ucode. Bug fixes will be ported to -17.ucode. 7265D, 3165 and 3168&#039;s latest firmware version is -29.ucode. In order to determine if your 7265 device is a &#039;D&#039; version, you can check the dmesg output:</p><p>Detected Intel(R) Dual Band Wireless AC 7265, REV=0x210</p><p>The revision number of a 7265D device is 0x210, if you see any other number, you have a 7265 device.</p></blockquote></div><p>As you can see, the firmware that your driver is trying to load (21 or 20) is either too new if your card is a 3160 (which requires &#039;17&#039;), or quite old if your card is 3168 (for which the latest is &#039;29&#039;). You should be able to browse the Linux firmware repository (<a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git">https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/ke … rmware.git</a>) to find the correct files.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>samuel.harkness wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I grabbed a &#039;daily&#039; build from OpenWRT. According to the status screen on the luci webapp, it&#039;s</p><p>Firmware Version&nbsp; &nbsp; OpenWrt Designated Driver 50072 / LuCI Master (git-17.341.69632-b7906fc)<br />Kernel Version&nbsp; &nbsp; 4.4.14</p></blockquote></div><p>If your card is a 3160, then there should be no issues as the kernel is recent enough. If it is a 3168, then your kernel is too old, as the first version which supports these devices is 4.6. This can be deduced from the iwlwifi home page by looking at the table <a href="https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/drivers/iwlwifi#firmware">here</a>.</p><p>Things To Try (tm):</p><p>1. Try to find the version &#039;17&#039; firmware for 3160. Download it, extract it and place it to a folder from which the driver can look for it.<br />2. Do the same as above, but for 3168. Look for version &#039;29&#039;. Make it available in the folder, and see if the driver picks it up.</p><p>To locate the potential folders where to place these firmware files, use the following command from an SSH terminal:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>find / -iname &#039;iwlwifi-*&#039;</code></pre></div><p> Look for files ending with &#039;.ucode&#039;. Installing &#039;iwlwifi-firmware&#039; package should&#039;ve dropped quite a few firmware files somewhere.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Antek</strong> on 18 Dec 2017, 13:48)</p>
