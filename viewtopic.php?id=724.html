					<p>Hi all,</p><p>dropbear runs without any problems. But since I need SCP/SFTP I installed openssh.<br />So I disabled dropbear, and moved away all files configured by dropbear.<br />Then I installed zlib, libssl, openssh-server, openssh-sftp-server.<br />The installation-scripts run through happily, I can see all files are installed successfully.<br />But when I try to connect to sshd (which starts perfectly after rebooting), I only get this, from another machine as well as locally:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/# ssh 10.10.10.10
ssh: connection to root@10.10.10.10:22 exited: remote closed the connection</code></pre></div><p>PuTTY just closes its window when connecting.<br />Can I view a log or something, to find out what is happening?</p>									</div>
