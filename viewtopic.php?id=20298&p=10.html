I guess I did read that but thought it was in the one uploaded to the downloads section of the server. My bad. Still getting used to this atheros stuff. Broadcom seemed much easier that&#039;s for sure. I also read Vincentfox&#039;s wiki entry: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/wrt160nl#installation">http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/wrt160nl#installation</a> and it says exactly what you told me. I guess I was too tired last night to concentrate enough. I had already read his intructions 3 or more times too.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mordak</strong> on 15 Sep 2009, 13:48)</p>

One (out of 20?) is for 160nl, maybe I haven&#039;t understood everything. My guess would be that the ar71xx/160nl has another profile than ar71xx/wrt400n and that the 160nl profile with correct wifi driver should be used for ar71xx/160nl? Or is the configuration only on the ar71xx level?</p>									</div>

					<p>I agree with Macbear.</p><p>Are the scripts for the buildbot in some repository? I couldn&#039;t find them.</p><p>What do we need for this?
