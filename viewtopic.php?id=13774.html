					<p>ROBIN (ROuting Batman Inside) is an&nbsp; Open Source mesh network project, developed on top of OpenWRT kamikaze, running on any Atheros AP51 routers such as Meraki Mini or La Fonera and using the BATMAN routing algorithm.</p><p>ROBIN is a zero-configuration appliance (plug &amp; play solution): all you need isalmost one DSL upstream DHCP capable router offering Internet connectivity where you connect a node (acting as gateway node), others nodes (client repeaters) have only to be powered on. Within a couple of minutes the mesh-cloud is raised up and self mantained, every repeater node wirelessly spread the gateway DSL connection through its open and WPA-PSK Access Points.</p><p>Images can be obtained merging/adding SVN files with OpenWrt kamikaze trunk and using .config file available in SVN.<br />These images (kernel vmlinux.gz and rootfs jffs2-64k) are pretty flashable using a very simple gui tool for Microsoft Windows platform or in the cassical way.<br />At present day ROBIN is tested and evaluated by simple users, community wireless, commercial and non-profit organizations. <br />open-mesh.com (<a href="http://www.open-mesh.com">http://www.open-mesh.com</a>) has developed own ROBIN backend server for remote management of ROBIN mesh clouds (dashboard, update, upgrade, statistics and graphs, ...) also offering pre-flashed routers. </p><p>development site:<br /><a href="https://www2.hosted-projects.com/trac/ansanto/robin/">https://www2.hosted-projects.com/trac/ansanto/robin/</a></p><p>subversion (SVN) repository:<br /><a href="https://svn2.hosted-projects.com/ansanto/robin/">https://svn2.hosted-projects.com/ansanto/robin/</a></p><p>HowTo and latest pre-compiled images:<br /><a href="http://www.blogin.it">http://www.blogin.it</a></p><p>open-mesh.com:<br /><a href="http://www.open-mesh.com">http://www.open-mesh.com</a></p><p>other pre-compiled images:<br /><a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/project/ponte2/">http://www.sourceforge.net/project/ponte2/</a></p>									</div>

					<p>When I read your announcement it just gives me a feeling that your trying to &quot;sell things a little to much&quot;. It seems you want to turn the B.A.T.M.A.N mesh concept into a product, which is fine - but, it would have been nice to read a &#039;company name&#039; (open-mesh.com) which was less of a copy of open-mesh.org or open-mesh.net, who both are associated with the project hosting the B.A.T.M.A.N development (<a href="https://www.open-mesh.net/batman">https://www.open-mesh.net/batman</a>).</p><p>Maybe it would be an idea to think about a change in name, there are a lot of alternative names ?</p><p>Chz</p>									</div>

					<p>glp,</p><p>I&#039;m not the owner of <a href="http://www.open-mesh.com">www.open-mesh.com</a> but only the developer of robin. <br />What I did want to say (and not sell, all is free) is that <a href="http://www.open-mesh.com">www.open-mesh.com</a> as FreTheNet.ca, Southern Telecom Media - China, Metrostat, and others has developed a free dasboard service. They works close to the main mantainer of Batman: togheter had a trip to Taipei at Accton Office and to Paris for Open Hardware conference... there is absolutely no problems.<br />However, I repeat, I&#039;m only the &#039;robin guy&#039;.Everyone can get robin, edit, modify and built a backend server on top of it as they want.<br />Hope I have been clear... my English is not so rich <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Antonio</p>									</div>
