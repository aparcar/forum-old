					<p>Hello,</p><p>the minimum packets you require are:</p><p>ipsec-tools: racoon, setkey, and kernel encryption modules<br />kmod-crypto-authenc: Module for block cipher modes (AEAD) (automatically installed with ipsec-tools in latest trunk)<br />kmod-ipsec: Basic security module (automatically installed with ipsec-tools in latest trunk)<br />kmod-ipsec4: IPv4 security module</p><p>Good luck with the small flash.</p><p>Markus</p>									</div>
