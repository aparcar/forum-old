					<p>It&#039;s not clear from what you wrote whether openvpn dies on your router or just the tunnel does. In the first case some type of script&nbsp; checking whether openvpn is alive would work (if tun0 goes down the suggestion above would work), in the second case it is just the question of your client trying to keep establishing openvpn connection if it fails on the first try. openvpn has options like &quot;resolv-retry infinite&quot; you can add to config files.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, from crontab you can run a short script every 5/10 minutes that checks whether the tunnel is up (ping something on the other side) and if not restarts the openvpn. That should do the job.</p>									</div>
