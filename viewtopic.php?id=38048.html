					<p>Hi, I hope someone can help with the following scenario,</p><p>I have setup OpenWRT with the following 3 interfaces:</p><p>Greenzone: LAN<br />Firewall zone: WAN, VPN</p><p>Right now all the traffic from LAN(Wired or WIFI) will go through the VPN connection.&nbsp; However the VPN server I am using is a bit slow than the normal connection without VPN.</p><p>Is there a way I can configure it so that I can limit only certain connections to use VPN, but the rest to use regular connection?</p><p>For example, can I create a guest WIFI for VPN connection only? Primary WIFI and all LAN traffic will not go through the VPN server?</p><p>Hope I explained it clearly, thanks very much in advance.</p><p>Cheers!</p>									</div>
