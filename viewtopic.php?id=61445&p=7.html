					<p>i have some idea. i guess, the rootsf and karnel file is ok to reflash to revert back. but when i m putting those file to the hootoo using tftp the light just flashes and cannot be detected at all. may be, i can remember, i have updated/ flashed several times with different version of the hootoo original firmware before flash the openwrt firmware. may be, there is a rule, u should only put back/ flash the files from appropriate firmware version that was present before openwrt. now i cant remember which one was present before putting openwrt on it. so, may be, i should try different rootsf and karnel files from different versions of firmware. for this case i should extract the original firmware of the different versions. but i dont know how to. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>there is a software named wireshark that captures from ethernet cable. i have tried just now with hootoo. i see in tftp mode first of all it just searches for a file karne. its destination is 10.10.10.254. for about 10 munites it still searches the same thing. so, may frirst it will search the karnel, and when it completes, it findes rootsf and may be another file or nothing.</p>									</div>
