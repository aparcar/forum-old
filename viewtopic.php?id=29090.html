					<p>I have an image of a squashfs rootfs . ie cut from a flash(rom) image with dd . I would like to mount this , open it up , do a small edit to a script file, resquash it back , then re write it back to the device. </p><p>I have an asus wl-600g running openwrt here that i could use . I believe the asus and the nsd100 are both little endian , if that matters?</p><p>the device is a emprex nsd100. there is /dev/mtd3 which is all squashfs. I was hoping to use dd to put the flash image back where it came from. </p><p> dd if=/mnt/data/public/squashfs.bin of=/dev/mtd3</p><p>where squashfs.bin is the modified file.</p><p>But I am stuck as to how to mount the file.</p><p>Ant help much appreciated.</p><p>pale</p>									</div>

					<p>from my post at <a href="http://emprex.codejs.com">http://emprex.codejs.com</a> ( join to see more stuff and forum topics and down load flash image&nbsp; for emprex nsd-100)</p><p>*****************************</p><br /><br /><p>This is how it is done ( from my crib notes ). It looks quite strait forwards , and it is, but it took quite a bit of time and reading of other web sites. thanks to <a href="http://tinyhack.com">http://tinyhack.com</a>/ for the info on how to find the start of the ramdisc. The guy at tinynack has done far more with a similar device, and this place <a href="http://emprex-nas.blogspot.com/2008/08/">http://emprex-nas.blogspot.com/2008/08/</a> ... d-100.html for getting me going with telnet and debian.</p><p>***********************************************<br />On a windows PC</p><p>load V03R14_eon.bin into hex editor . I use &quot;hex editor neo&quot; ( demo lasts 14 days )</p><p>search for 1f 8b 08 ,this is the header of a gzip archive. ( search in hex not ascii )</p><p>found at two places, cut at 2nd 0x0017af34 just before it says ramdisk ,cut right to the end of the file. The ramdisk isn&#039;t as big as this but when we open it up the extra bit will be left.</p><p>save as file ending in gz ie ramdiskfs.gz</p><p>I opened this file with winrar</p><p><a href="http://www.rarlab.com">http://www.rarlab.com</a>/</p><p>you get a file called ramdisk ,extract and save it to a file called ramdisk some where on your pc.</p><p>with your nsd100 running and your pc looking at the samba share &quot;public&quot; copy to &quot;public&quot;</p><p>on the nsd100 this will be in<br />/mnt/data/public</p><p>Now login to the nsd100 via telnet<br />type</p><p>mknod /dev/loop0 b 7 0<br />mkdir /mnt/ram<br />mount -o loop /mnt/data/public/ramdisk /mnt/ram</p><p>edit /mnt/ram/etc/init.d/rc.sysinit ( I did this across samba as I have a share on the root and use SCiTE <a href="http://www.scintilla.org">http://www.scintilla.org</a> to edit the file as this does not create CR at the end of the line )</p><p>add</p><p>#start telnet demon<br />echo &quot;pts/0&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/securetty<br />/usr/sbin/telnetd</p><p>#wait 15 seconds<br />sleep 15<br />#run script boot in public</p><p>/mnt/data/public/boot</p><br /><p>just before this line at the end</p><p>/bin/echo &quot;Sysinit done&quot;</p><p>save file</p><br /><p>umount /mnt/ram<br />( need to be out of /ram directory to do this.just type cd /)</p><p>cd /mnt/data/public<br />gzip ramdisk</p><p>to recompress. it takes 5 minutes or so just watch the telnet session for your cursor to come back. I did this on the nsd100 as I knew it would be able to decompress it later when it boots . dont do it in winrar the compression is the wrong type and will brick your nsd100.</p><p>this makes ramdisk.gz</p><p>on the windows pc copy the ramdisk.gz file back to the pc</p><p>paste this back into the flash image with hex edit neo</p><p>make sure the paste goes in at address 0x0017af34 starting with 1f 8b 08 00</p><p>and the end bytes of what you are pasting are 00 00 40 01 ( my image was abit smaller than the original )</p><p>save flash image . as V03R14_new.bin</p><br /><p>reflash device with new patched image using the update firmware page on the nsd100 web interface.<br />this takes a few minutes.</p><p>it will reboot its self , you config should stay , IP address etc.</p><p>on the public share you need to add the script file &quot;boot&quot; .
