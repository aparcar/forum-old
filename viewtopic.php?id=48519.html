					<p>Hi all.</p><p>I&#039;ve been having issues getting my WR703n router to access the wifi.</p><p>It&#039;d gone through everything I could think of, but I could get into Luci, or get the wifi to work so I coud download the packages update.</p><p>So I thought it might have been the file itself. So I downloaded the JFFs2 version of the file, and installed that using putty. </p><p>I used the &#039;mtd -r write a.bin firmware&#039;&nbsp; (with the file renames to a.bin so I don&#039;t need to write down everything).</p><p>Now I can&#039;t access anything. I&#039;ve tried using putty to open 192.168.1.1 and it times out, with telnet &amp; SSH. I read later that JFFS2 doesn&#039;t have failsafe. And trying to use it anyway doesn&#039;t want to work. </p><p>Does anybody have any other suggestions to get it back?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>There is a recovery mode for openwrt altho im not sure it would work for you as it seems you have overwritten something you shouldn&#039;t have like the bootloader, anyway here is the link to generic recovery;</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe</a></p><p>If that dont work then you need to flash the nand using serial or jtag;</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.debrick">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.debrick</a></p>									</div>
