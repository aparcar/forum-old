(Not tested on BB or CC yet.) but it is working. </p><p>Or take a look into old packages for fprobe.</p>									</div>

I have a question, though, about your config:</p><p>Why did you set the sampling_rate to 100 in your softflowd config? If I&#039;m understanding the program, that would only look at every 100th packet (creating statistical samples of the flow information). This would make sense if the the router were handling hundreds of thousands of packets a second, but at home, recording info for each packet isn&#039;t a burden.
