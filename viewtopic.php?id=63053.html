					<p>I need 2nd ethernet adapter for raspbery PI.<br />Tried D-LINK DUB-E100. Found it uncapable of real full duplex although ethtool reports its in full duplex mode and vendor advertises its full duplex functionality. Adapter behaves in windows even worse than linux. Tested on 2 powerful PCs with core i7 connected with gbit network and giving 960 mbit /sec on their built in NICs.<br />What dlink shows : one direction - 96 mbit, other direction - 6 mbit.<br />I know USB 2.0 is half duplex itself but its capable of transferring data with 37 mbyte/sec speed. This is what my usb 3.0 flash drive gives me when connected to 2.0.<br />100 mbit is about 12 mbyte/sec. Thats why I suppose good usb 2.0 to ethernet adapter can use time slicing for bidirectional transfer of 24 mbyte/sec.<br />So i wonder if such adapters exist.<br />What about gigabit usb 3.0 ethernet adapter connected to usb 2.0 port ? Will it be able to do full duplex at 100 mbit ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bolvan</strong> on 29 Feb 2016, 17:46)</p>

					<p>I saw this <a href="http://forum.doozan.com/read.php?8,25571">post</a> and managed to get one from the same seller (currently no longer available, but you can try to buy from <a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Hot-100Mbps-USB-2-0-to-RJ45-Lan-Network-Ethernet-Adapter-Card-Asix-AX8872B-For-Mac/32329874595.html">seller</a>) to test on my Seagate GoFLEX Home. It works as described by the OP on the <a href="http://forum.doozan.com/read.php?8,25571">post</a>. Unless you don&#039;t care about a clone (probably counterfeited) version, you better ask the seller if the product looks exactly like the one on the pictures in the ad.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thats sad. Vendors simply lie about 100 mbit full duplex capabilities of their devices.<br />I ordered UA3-45-03BK device with ability to return if it doesn&#039;t fit my needs.<br />Will see how it works in USB 3.0 and USB 2.0.</p>									</div>

					<p>I did simple experiment.

					<p>In this case, the one I mentioned in my 1st post should give you about 10/2 MBps down/up-load speed on a 100 Mbps connection. I believe my 2 MBps upload limitation is due bandwidth allocation speed capped by my ISP to about 20 Mbps.</p>									</div>
