					<p>I&#039;m having similar issues compiling the open source version, I suspect the reason why the toolchain files don&#039;t work is because they&#039;re precompiled for 32bit. I had similar issues because my Ubuntu was running 64bit.</p><p>Edit: Based on this article (<a href="http://www.xtremesystems.org/forums/showthread.php?256335-Belkin-N1-Vision-F5D8232-4-Custom-Firmware&amp;s=375355d8e4ed540f6559ae018bb203e8&amp;p=4492517&amp;viewfull=1#post4492517">http://www.xtremesystems.org/forums/sho … ost4492517</a>) it appears that those files are designed to be built on Debian 5.0.5</p><p>Edit 2: Actually Debian doesn&#039;t work. I tried it with OpenSuse 12.2 and compiling it works and I have the final image. I would have posted up the version but it is for the F5D8231-4 v5 instead.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Hengjie</strong> on 21 Nov 2012, 02:42)</p>
