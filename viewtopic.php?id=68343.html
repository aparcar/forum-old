					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m working a project to help some of my tech illiterate family with some networking. What I have is a WR703N that is configured (nearly) perfectly how I want to hand them out (except for a simpler web gui that I&#039;m working on). I&#039;m now trying to get familiar with Image Generator so I can make an image that has all of the config files and packages setup in the ROM so it is basically a clone of the one I am developing with. </p><p>For security purposes I want to allow them to change the router password and their SSID/WPA2 password. I am going to work on a simple replacement GUI replacement for Luci that has just those three fields available to edit. I know it is inevitable that they will forget their password at some point. Failsafe mode is way beyond the scope of their abilities. Setting a static IP address would be an hour long hair pulling conversation with about a 10% chance of success, let alone anything else. Even getting access to a screen share to take control over their machine is only possible about 1 in 5 tries. So you can imagine why it is important for me to make it easy to reset it to the default /rom settings. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>If I understand the filesystem correctly when a &quot;firstboot&quot; command is issued that clears everything in &quot;/overlay&quot;. I&#039;m uncertain if merely deletes everything in overlay and when the file is missing from /overlay it then reads from /rom, or if it copies all the files from /rom to /overlay the first time the device is booted, but I think the result is the same... it returns it to the state when the image was first installed. </p><p>What I would like to do is configure the firmware so when the reset button is held down instead of going to failsafe mode is just clears the overlay back to the default state - which is my case will have the wifi listening on a default SSID/PW so they can get back in and modify it.</p><p>Is this possible to do? Part of me thought this behavior might already be present if you held the button long enough. I had to clear the device after I screwed up by unlinking eth0 from LAN and I swear that when I held it in I was taken to Luci where it asked me to set the root pw and everything was a fresh install state. I never SSH&#039;d or Telnet&#039;d in. But part of me doubts my recollection only because I haven&#039;t seen that behavior documented. I would test it again except I have the device in a state I don&#039;t want to risk screwing up right now until I get a second device to test my custom image on. </p><p>Here&#039;s a side question in case someone viewing has some insight on this also... anyone have any tips for creating a very simple web GUI. I&#039;m not familiar with Lua and the Luci source looks a tad daunting at first glance. Is there any package out there that provides a super simple HTTP server with some type of server side logic or hooks. I need to really just process 3 or 4 different POST variables and write them to their appropriate values in /etc/config files. Worst case I can probably figure out how to strip everything out of Luci and create my own page without a ton of trouble, but just checking if there was a simpler way.</p>									</div>

					<p>After poking around more I figured it out, so I wanted to update for others. It does appear that holding the reset button down performs a &quot;reset to default&quot; image as opposed to what I understood was failsafe mode, at least on this particular profile. </p><p>You can edit the behavior of the buttons (reset included) in /etc/rc.button/</p><p>In this case /etc/rc.button/reset <br />has the following code:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[ &quot;${ACTION}&quot; = &quot;released&quot; ] || exit 0

. /lib/functions.sh

logger &quot;$BUTTON pressed for $SEEN seconds&quot;

if [ &quot;$SEEN&quot; -lt 1 ]
then
        echo &quot;REBOOT&quot; &gt; /dev/console
        sync
        reboot
elif [ &quot;$SEEN&quot; -gt 5 ]
then
        echo &quot;FACTORY RESET&quot; &gt; /dev/console
        jffs2reset -y &amp;&amp; reboot &amp;
fi

return 0</code></pre></div><p>So it is calling jffs2reset -y and then rebooting when the reset button is held for 5+ seconds. I believe jffs2reset is synonymous with &quot;firstboot&quot; also.</p>									</div>
