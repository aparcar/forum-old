					<p>i have the latest trunk now, of tp link 1043nd.<br />the upgrade seems to work good, because i have internet and everything(so it seems) working good, except from the gui of openwrt.<br />when i&#039;m trying to get into luci, AKA: <a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a>, i get the black screen of luci, for a second.<br />this black screen have the line(in white) Luci - Lua configuration interface, and then it should get into luci, but instead i get the error:<br />Oops! Google Chrome could not connect to 192.168.1.1&nbsp; --(when i&#039;m surfing with chrome).<br />if i&#039;m trying to get into <a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a> with firefox, i don&#039;t get the luci screen, but instead get a usual error of firefox:<br />Firefox can&#039;t establish a connection to the server at 192.168.1.1.</p><p>how can i fix this?</p><p>thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>well, after i install luci again(not sure i need to) and start and enabled it again, i now can access the web interface.<br />i think i just need to do this:<br />/etc/init.d/uhttpd enable<br />/etc/init.d/uhttpd start</p><p>maybe luci just wasn&#039;t working after the sysupgrade.</p><p>well, now it seems that everything is working, but after i installed luci, i got this message:</p><p> * resolve_conffiles: Existing conffile /etc/config/luci is different from the conffile in the new package. The new conffile will be placed at /etc/config/luci-opkg.</p><p>so what conffile is in use, and is it matter?<br />in luci, from what i saw, everything semms to be like it was before the sysupgrade.<br />do i need to replace the config file? <br />if yes, how do i copy the new one to be the active one(if it&#039;s not now)</p>									</div>
