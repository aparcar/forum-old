					<p>I have an On Networks N150R and was trying to access it via Serial, with the instructions on this page:</p><p>wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wnr612v2#serial</p><p>The connection diagram say pin 1=GND, 2=TX, 3=RX and 4=3.3V</p><p>The picture shows connections to pins 2,3, and 4 while reading other serial pages says to connect GND, TX, and RX.</p><p>These 2 statements, one being the photo and the other being the pinout don&#039;t equal the same thing!</p><p>Can someone, please, take a look and correct one or the other?</p><p>I need to get serial working so I can change the network settings on my board.</p><p>Thank you!</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, the wiki is user contributed and I doubt that anyone will fix anything for you. It&#039;s up to you to fix the wiki page.</p><p>Usually GND, TX &amp; RX need to be connected. My first guess is that GND and VCC are swapped&nbsp; in the table. Please use a multimeter to check which one has 3.3V. Create a wiki account and fix the table.</p>									</div>
