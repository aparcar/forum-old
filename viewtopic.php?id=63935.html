					<p>You should try both ssh and telnet with<br />- empty password<br />- the old root password that you used to enter the Luci GUI in order to flash the new firmware (when you downgraded from DD to CC).

I have reseted the router but it still need password and telnet is refused. Before flashing I saw the version of the hardware which was DIR 824 B1.
