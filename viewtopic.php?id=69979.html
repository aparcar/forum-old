					<p>Thanks so much for your reply.&nbsp; I tried your advice, but no success.&nbsp; It saved ok, used printenv to check after reset and its still all there, but still errors with bad magic number.&nbsp; So I tried them all, one by one, and same thing:</p><p>ar7240&gt; bootm 0x9fe50000<br />## Booting image at 9fe50000 ...<br />Bad Magic Number<br />ar7240&gt; bootm 0x9f650000<br />## Booting image at 9f650000 ...<br />Bad Magic Number<br />ar7240&gt; bootm 0x9f050000<br />## Booting image at 9f050000 ...<br />Bad Magic Number</p><p>I am now concentrating on the original firmware from OEM website, as I am unsure if my changing &quot;_image&quot; to &quot;.image&quot; in the tarballs is helping or hindering me (ref hornet-UB hardware page).</p>									</div>

					<p>Thankyou, I will try this.&nbsp; I have selected lede-17.01.0-r3205-59508e3-ar71xx-generic-hornet-ub-squashfs-factory.bin as best choice -- lots to choose from (!!), but there weren&#039;t that many &#039;factory&#039; options.</p><p>I am still concerned that it&#039;s contents are kernel<strong>_</strong>image and rootfs<strong>_</strong>image.&nbsp; The (OpenWRT) hardware page for my router notes that the extensions should be (changed to) <strong>.</strong>image ... so I will try it both ways and post results shortly.</p><p>If I wasn&#039;t using tftp to xfer the files I would be wondering if it the file xfer process was stripping the high bit etc.&nbsp; I am also wondering about where Im cp.b ing the file to.&nbsp; The idea (already tried, above) of trying to launch the code at different locations had also occured to me, but Im wondering if this needs to be matched with a different target for the cp.b also.</p><p>Standby ... results to follow shortly.&nbsp; Thanks again.</p>									</div>

					<p>@sil5er<br />I don&#039;t know if you figured this out by now, but maybe it will help someone else out. Plus a little reminder for me when I come a searching again later I&#039;m sure. Sorry to bring an old post back.&nbsp; <br />I deactivated my anti-virus and all was well after that. I&#039;m not sure if it was the firewall or what. Windows firewall was still on but my Advast antivirus has all kinds of protection.... so I just shut it down until I was done....done in like under 2 minutes!!D If that. Good luck.</p>									</div>
