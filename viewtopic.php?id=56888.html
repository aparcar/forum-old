					<p>I&#039;m trying to reset my TP Link TL-WDR4300 v1.7 that&#039;s running barrier breaker 14.07 so I can sell it. There&#039;s a &quot;Perform reset&quot; button but it comes with the following caveat: &quot;To reset the firmware to its initial state, click &quot;Perform reset&quot; (only possible with squashfs images).&quot;.</p><p>Can someone please provide me with some simple easy to follow instructions. I&#039;m so frustrated right now!!! I&#039;ve used both Tomato and DDWRT but OpenWRT is by far the least user friendly software I&#039;ve ever used.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>4n2t0</strong> on 17 Apr 2015, 18:29)</p>

					<p>A &quot;reset&quot; in the OpenWrt GUI means reseting to default OpenWrt settings. This is really very simple. </p><p>If you want to flash back to stock, follow the directions in the wiki. Be careful because this router is at risk of being bricked when going back to stock if you don&#039;t pay attention and follow those directions carefully!</p><p>(I agree BTW that OpenWrt could be more user friendly, but that&#039;s not the focus of this project. It is definitely much more powerful and worth the trouble IMO though!)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drawz</strong> on 17 Apr 2015, 19:40)</p>

On windows 7 I have used &#039;opentftpserver&#039;.&nbsp; Place your cut firmware image in C:\opentftpserver making sure to rename it to &#039;wdr4300v1_tp_recovery.bin&#039;.</p><p>Check your IP address is 192.168.0.66.&nbsp; Fire up opentftpserver.&nbsp; Fire up the router whilst holding the reset button for 10 seconds or so.&nbsp; Invoke lucky charms as required.&nbsp; You should see opentftpserver say that it&#039;s uploading a file &#039;wdr4300v1_tp_recovery.bin&#039; to 192.168.0.88.</p><p>Good luck.</p>									</div>

					<p>hahaha What a mardy pants! The router is worth more money with OpenWrt on it anyway!</p><p>By the way you go back to ddwrt and see if so many people get back to you in there forums. The people in this forum are really nice i am blind and had a problem with Luci and my screen reader and it was fixed for me.<br /> I mite<br /> be the only blind dude that uses OpenWrt but it stil got fixed because I asked nicely. You cant come on to a forum for a free piece of software and act like the world owes you something!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tapper</strong> on 18 Apr 2015, 00:37)</p>
