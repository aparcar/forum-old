					<p>I&#039;m looking to set up a way to connect to my OpenWRT (7.09 kamikaze) router from work through a secure/encrypted method and anonymize/proxy my internet traffic through the router. </p><p>I don&#039;t really need a full blown tor.

					<p>I&#039;m using a normal proxy and a ssh tunnel for what you describe.</p><p>I&#039;ve successfully used both tinyproxy, msocksd and srelay.</p><p>Then for tunneling, I just use putty and setup SSH Tunnels in there to match the proxy configuration.</p><p>At the moment I use Srelay on port 1080.

					<p>I installed the x-wrt webif interface and I vaguely remember (got a bad cold and taking decongestants so it&#039;s a bit fuzzy) it saying something about enabling ssh. To test ssh I just need to fire up putty and try to connect to my router from internet?</p><p>Also, it appears tinyproxy, msocksd and srelay are all types of proxy servers? So, I would only need one of those, currently I have privoxy installed but I suppose if one of the alternatives is faster then I could use it. I didn&#039;t know they existed and only knew about privoxy so I chose that. What&#039;s the advantage to the others? I&#039;m looking for basic proxy for web that can also allow me to either use meebo through web or pidgin for IM.</p><p>Thanks for the reply.</p>									</div>

					<p>The reason I used 8080 is I talked to IT at work and they said that the firewall is open for that port. Something isn&#039;t right as I can SSH from home on the LAN but not from WAN. I may have to talk to him and take a look at the corporate firewall to see if it blocking me getting out. I created an identical rule for 443 (HTTPS) and that works to get to the web interface of the router from the WAN. He said he had 8080 open but maybe he was wrong. He will open port 22 for me for testing but I&#039;d rather not have the router listening on port 22, since that port seems to be getting a lot of attention lately.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>webif interface wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Firewall:</p><p>Here you can forward ports and more.

Admin rights isn&#039;t a problem, I have that on all machines involved.<br />I did some reading and still looking into TAP vs. TUN and what exactly needs to be done on the router besides installing OpenVPN (that&#039;s already done)</p><p>The webif interface is nice, it makes point and click configuration easy.
