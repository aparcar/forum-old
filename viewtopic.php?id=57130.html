					<p>Hi.</p><p>Is it possible with OpenWrt, to setup the router as a switch for wired 802.1X Network Authentication?</p><p>I can&#039;t find any manuals on it.<br />I am simulating a setup in Virtualbox.</p><p>I want something similar to this:<br /><a href="http://packetlife.net/blog/2008/aug/6/simple-wired-8021x-lab/">http://packetlife.net/blog/2008/aug/6/s â€¦ 8021x-lab/</a></p><p>I currently have two subnets on the OpenWrt router.<br />192.168.1.x<br />192.168.2.x</p><p>and connected wired.<br />Openwrt is DHCP for 192.168.2.x, and wan for internet.</p><p>In virtualbox, is another machine &quot;LFS&quot; on the 192.168.2.x subnet, and gets IP by DHCP OpenWrt.</p><p>On the OpenWrt router is setup a functioning freeradius database.<br />The radius daemon accepts calls from 192.168.2.x subnet.</p><p>Can I somehow simulate, that LFS can&#039;t get access to 192.168.2.x subnet, before it is authenticated on<br />the Radius daemon?</p><p>I can find manual for windows, but not for OpenWrt.</p>									</div>

					<p>This is not available in OpenWRT as it stands today. I&#039;m unsure if it&#039;s even possible. It would depend on what interaction the CPU can have with the switch chip. Right now OpenWRT has pertty minimal interaction with the switch chip, essentially just setting up VLAN configurations.</p>									</div>

					<p>You would have to dissolve the LAN bridge[1] and push all traffic through the SOC (so wpasupplicant can implement IEE802.1X), which would limit your LAN throughput way too much for most (basically all) SOCs.</p><p>[1] talking only about a theoretical solution, not a potential OpenWrt configuration/ integration.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>slh</strong> on 4 May 2015, 00:27)</p>

					<p>It&#039;s not really that it would be impossible but it would be a lot of development work to implement as you really need support from the switch chip. If the switch chip in the router supported 802.1x (and some do) it would theoretically be possible to add wired 802.1x configuration support (really just passing of configuration through to the switch chip including the RADIUS server IP) but that would need to be implemented differently for each switch chip supporting 802.1x and at the end of the day you&#039;re expending a lot of effort for a typically 4 port switch.</p><p>In most cases if you need wired 802.1x you&#039;re better off to combine OpenWRT as a router/AP with a dedicated managed switch which would support 802.1x.</p>									</div>
