					<p>I&#039;m currently trying to setup failover to a 4G modem (cable for main WAN) on the WRT1900ac running RC3 and it seems I&#039;m entering uncharted territory.&nbsp; Per the mwan3 documentation, I&#039;ve attempted to turn port 0 into a second WAN interface using a VLAN (eth0.3), but when I do this the WAN2 I&#039;ve created only shows up in the luci routing table as belonging to local (not main); and, strangely, only under IPv6.&nbsp; I&#039;ve configured the metrics correctly, and /etc/config/network shows the WAN2 interface setup for standard DHCP.&nbsp; Setting up a static route does not seem to help either.</p><p>Interestingly enough, the switch shows ports 0-6, with 5 being labeled CPU.&nbsp; By default on RC3, VLAN 1 has all untagged with 4 and 6 off, and VLAN 2 with all off except 4 and 6 (untagged).&nbsp; Forgive my ignorance, but given only 5 ports on the device, is port 6 (the 7th) meant to be the 2nd core of the CPU?&nbsp; RC3 also comes with WLAN6, an IPv6 branch of eth1.</p><p>Eth0.3, the third VLAN which I&#039;ve added, is currently setup with only port 0 untagged and the rest off, per the mwan3 documentation, but it seems the routing table doesn&#039;t want to put it under &quot;main&quot;.&nbsp; Unsurprisingly the eth0.3 RX sits at 0.</p><p>I&#039;ve used OpenWRT in the past, along with DD-WRT, and haven&#039;t run into an issue like this.&nbsp; User error or RC3 bug?&nbsp; Would I be better off trying to get a USB-ethernet device running and ditching a 2nd WAN port via VLAN?</p>									</div>
