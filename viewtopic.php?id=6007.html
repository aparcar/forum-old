					<p>Hello...</p><p>I would like to know if there is a simple way to create serial ports for the WRT54G without building it myself? Because, I don&#039;t like electronic. I don&#039;t want to take the risk to damage my hardware or to have to test the wires during hours.</p><p>Idealy, I would be interested by buying a wire wich would do the same thing as this one :&nbsp; <a href="http://www.rwhitby.net/wrt54gs/serial.html">http://www.rwhitby.net/wrt54gs/serial.html</a></p><p>Because I would like to build a little software that would use a GPS and a GSM on the WRT54G. I though about the WRT54G, because it is simple to use, there is a huge support (with the OpenWRT) and it&#039;s really cheaper. As it is powered by a 12V alimentation, it would be pretty simple to supply in car. And with that stuff we could localisate our car at any moment.</p><p><span class="bbu">The main goal would be :</span><br />GPS --(serial port)--&gt; WRT54G/gpsd -&gt; software of my own --(serial port)--&gt; GSM</p><p>+ The WIFI : It could permit to send continuous localisation data (but that&#039;s not the main goal)</p><p>Frequently, it would do a minimal connection to a server (via GSM/GPRS), and if the server ask for something, it would give the GPS position.</p><p>Actual products cost minimum 600$ and aren&#039;t really efficient... As it would be an OpenSource and personnal use software, people could make it working on every widely used (or not) software (like Google Earth).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>superfc</strong> on 7 Jun 2006, 02:37)</p>

					<p>You may use a serial data cable for cell phones (or a usb one that converts to cell-phone plug), cut off the cell phone plug, and wire it to one of the serial connectors or the WRT.<br />This still involves:<br />- finding ground, power, Tx and Rx (check the docs for the cell phone)<br />- checking voltages on the Tx and Rx wires while the cable is connected to the PC (and data sent, without handshaking on)<br />... but no risk, no fun.</p><p>When you built one, copy it so you have a console cable (for serial 1, 115.2k) and a data cable (for serial 2, 9600).</p>									</div>

					<p>I suck with a soldering iron too.</p><p>You can buy the MAX233 kits assembled for an extra $6. That&#039;s what I did. Then I got a friend with a soldering iron to do the minor job of adding an IDC-10 connector to the board.&nbsp; For cabling I bought some ribbon cable and those blue snap-on connectors and after some flipping of wires to get the pinouts to match got it working.</p><p>All I need to connect my kit to any new device is adding the IDC-10 connector itself which costs less than a dollar.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 8 Jun 2006, 01:02)</p>
