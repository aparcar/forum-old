					<p>Hello.</p><p>Where can I find documentation about the usage of .trx files?</p><p>I know they can be used to restore a firmware image from within openwrt with the mtd command, but aside from that, can a trx file be used to restore a router that has the original firmware on it?</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Stanislas</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t know of any good documentation out there, so I&#039;ll write a brief synopsis here.</p><p>TRX is a common firmware image format. Basically, it&#039;s a small header that defines the offsets of up to 3 &#039;partitions&#039; of the firmware image (usually loader, vmlinuz, OS), along with a signature, checksum, version, and length of the image.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>struct trx_header {
    uint32_t magic;            /* &quot;HDR0&quot; */
    uint32_t len;            /* Length of file including header */
    uint32_t crc32;            /* 32-bit CRC from flag_version to end of file */
    uint32_t flag_version;    /* 0:15 flags, 16:31 version */
    uint32_t offsets[3];    /* Offsets of partitions from start of header */
};</code></pre></div><p>TRX files can be created with the TRX or ASUSTRX tools you&#039;ll find in any firmare source for this platform.</p><p>Sometimes, vendors who use the TRX format also pre-pend their own header to this and require that header to be present. An example is the addpattern tool for the WRT54G(S) and other Linksys devices.</p><p>So, that&#039;s what a TRX file is. Whether or not the original firmware supports this format depends on the particular device and firmware. OpenWrt should support images that only have a TRX header, and also those that have the extended addpattern type header.</p>									</div>
