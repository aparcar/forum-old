					<p>Hello </p><p>wl500w-openwrt-7880.trx k.2.4 was a couple of days learning experience, but the buildroot compiling environment works impressively good... Respect guys. At the and I have bash shell script for unattended compile of the latest svn snapshot which I happily share with other WL500W users.</p><p>There is though a &quot;minor&quot; challenge left as the compiled image when loaded with tftp doesn&#039;t reply to ping to 192.168.1.1, Shit! Bricked AGAIN??? Uploading back the original WL500W_1.9.8.2_TW.trx and ... Ping is back. What a relief. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>You can see the buildWL500W.sh script my latest almost fully enabled config and 7880.trx and 7887.trx image at <a href="http://cinober.files-upload.com">http://cinober.files-upload.com</a>/</p><p>WL500-W users, have you any idea what am I doing wrong ?</p><p>I have earlier bricked one box so I am at the moment avoiding opening the box (Warranty seal). Are there any docs on building/using USB serial console?</p><p>If anyone helps me fix the missing ping &quot;inconvenience&quot;, the latest SVN snapshot binary builds for WL-500W could be made available automatically, making that platform one step closer to supported.</p><p>Thanks for any input.</p><p>Regards cinober</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey Cinober. <br />I&#039;ve just tried your 7910 build from <a href="http://cinober.files-upload.com">http://cinober.files-upload.com</a>/.<br />I had no problem flashing my WL-500W and telnet to it afterwards. So great job so far.</p><p>I still have to problems. The first one is the one you pointed out yourself: I doesn&#039;t save any changes, so all settings are lost on reboot.</p><p>The second one is much worse: No wireless.</p><p>Well the wireless seems to work.<br />I go to /etc/config/wireless to configure it, and run /sbin/wifi up<br />Then I can connect to the router through wireless.</p><p>So it seems that this would work pretty good if the settings for wireless wasn&#039;t lost if I loose power and the router is restarted.</p><p>So if there is anything i can try to help you figure this out; just let me know.</p><p>Smint</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m having a strange problem with my 500w.&nbsp; I follow Cinober&#039;s howto from the hardware page (a few of the paths have changed, but not hard to figure out) and build Kamikaze (10065) without any errors.&nbsp; It flashes fine, and seems to boot ok - ie the power light comes back on when the kernel finishes booting, however I have no network connectivity and cannot ping/ssh/whatever.&nbsp; I even tried using a few of the prebuilt images from <a href="http://marjancinober.googlepages.com/wl500-index.htm">http://marjancinober.googlepages.com/wl500-index.htm</a> but still no joy.&nbsp; Reflashing the original firmware works, and I can ping/www, so it&#039;s not a hardware problem...&nbsp; It&#039;s something with the image.&nbsp; </p><p>I think my next step is to build an image without any wifi drivers to see if that works...&nbsp; It may be that Asus has switched to a different minipci wifi card, and trying to load the broadcom driver is crashing the router.&nbsp; </p><p>I&#039;d also like to install a serial console but am not sure where the pins are.&nbsp; Plus, I suck at soldering, so I&#039;m quite nervous about bricking the thing.&nbsp; Still, I&#039;m going to pick up a cable + soldering iron today and give it a whirl.&nbsp; Cracking the case will also let me see for sure which wifi card is in there.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping it&#039;ll be obvious which pins are the serial port, or that the board is similar to some of the other Asus/Broadcom routers that I&#039;ve seen howto-serial pics of online.</p><p>Wish me luck!</p>									</div>
