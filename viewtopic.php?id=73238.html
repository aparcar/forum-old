					<p>Hello Everyone!</p><p>I see on some pages that a merger is happening with the documentation, so I understand that what I am going to say may already be addressed. So I am new here also, so that could be my problem as well.</p><p>So anyway, I have OpenWRT installed on a router and some of the most intensely basic questions I have I am not finding answers to, which means it isn&#039;t documented or the documentation isn&#039;t being pulled up in google or I&#039;m not able to navigate to it from the website already. I want to remedy this. I want to help point out some things that could be clarified or mentioned at all.</p><p>Are you guys just migrating the documentation from one location, or are you merging documentations? Do you have plans to revisit any pages? I don&#039;t wanna waste time by suggesting things that are already going to get addressed. Eh, I dunno how to go about this I guess.</p><p>For instance, this link *well you don&#039;t get a link because I&#039;m not even allowed to link to your own website, ha. now I feel like I&#039;m giving you as much information as the documentation gives me* has a section for command invocation of OPKG. Nowhere does it tell you where these go. Nothing looks like a traditional CLI, some things look like a CLI with extra junk that makes me think it&#039;s not just a normal, plain terminal. It doesn&#039;t even strike me as necessarily being a terminal, as some of them just look like text logs.</p><p>Maybe I sound stupid or like I haven&#039;t looked hard enough for things. I guess that could be true. You shouldn&#039;t have to look hard for something that is documented though. Making something hard to find that is supposed to make things easy on you is very counterproductive.</p><p>Personally though I intend to start developing programs for this platform. I haven&#039;t ran a linux machine in like a decade, and when I did before I hardly messed with it, so linux is still relatively new to me. I really want to join the open source community moving into the future. Any help along this path would be great. Any help I can help people get in the future would be really great.</p><p>So ultimately, as I try to familiarize myself with OpenWRT I would find it cool to have somebody to talk to and be like, &quot;hey so I read all this shiznit and it&#039;s lacking here and here. I assume I do this thing here like this, right? But I know other people would be even more confused, or scared to do that step because it technically isn&#039;t telling them to do that, it&#039;s just saying this.&quot; and then we rewrite it some to fix it or submit stuff to somebody who will later.</p><p>(I have [formally] gone through over half of the CCNA course. I think it&#039;s crazy how simple this could be to use, but isn&#039;t. But that could just be me. Idk though. It&#039;s weird when I cannot configure a router how I want [and feel like it&#039;s my fault].)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>userbob</strong> on 12 Feb 2018, 18:16)</p>

					<p>Seems you are refering to the documentation on wiki.openwrt.org.<br />Have you already tried <a href="https://openwrt.org/?">https://openwrt.org/?</a></p><p>What&#039;s the difference?<br />wiki.openwrt.org = the original / old OpenWrt wiki<br />openwrt.org = the former wiki.lede-project.org wiki, which evolved from the OpenWrt wiki, and to which the old wiki will be merged.</p>									</div>
