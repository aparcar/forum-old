					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I plan on using something like Icecast to broadcast sounds/music from my computer.</p><p>I would like to setup openwrt to play my Icecast stream over one of those usb soundcards compatible with openwrt.</p><p>Is there a problem with me leaving the router to continuously playing the streaming signal from my computer? say 24/7 even when nothing is playing on my stream?&nbsp; Will it timeout or drop the connection or anything like that?</p>									</div>
