					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have 2 devices:</p><p>Device A: Huawei E8231 emits wifi signal</p><p>Device B: Ravpower WD-02 device emits wifi signal</p><p>Device A has access to internet and is running stock firmware.</p><p>Device B doesn&#039;t have access to internet and is running Openwrt Attitude Adjustment. I followed instructions from <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/ravpower/rp-wd02">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/ravpower/rp-wd02</a></p><p>I want device B to connect to A, wirelessly. So that when I connect to device B&#039;s wifi through computer or phone, I can access internet seamlessly. </p><p>(Just the way chromecast device&#039;s wifi network can easily join any other wifi network for internet given that network&#039;s SSID and password)</p><p>I have already looked up the option of WDS, which I think my device A doesn&#039;t support even if my device B supports it (as client). There isn&#039;t much I can do on the 3G dongle in terms of routing.</p><p>Any other way I can go about this?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes routed client is usually the best way to deal with a MiFi type device.&nbsp; You may also be able to USB tether it.&nbsp; Newer devices use CDC or RNDIS instead of the old ppp over a ttyUSB type connection, but this one may not be that new.&nbsp; OpenWrt has drivers for both types.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 20 Mar 2017, 15:05)</p>

					<p>I googled and saw this page; <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedclient">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedclient</a><br />which is the same as mk24&#039;s reference &quot;routed client&quot;.&nbsp; there are three methods there, I don&#039;t know networking so well and get confused with the terminology. </p><p>1. is that page relevant to me? are any of those methods what i want?<br />2. if so, which method in that page should I use? <br />3. if you are recommending a method on that page, can you please clear terminology for me. </p><p>What is device B (runs openwrt on ravpower-wd02 device)? Is device B&#039;s wifi a &quot;Access point&quot;?</p><p>What is device A (3g unit with internet and wifi signal)? is device A&#039;s wifi a &quot;Client&quot;?</p><p>Another info: My 3g unit (device A)&#039;s router page is on 192.168.8.1. I know that it gives out ip addresses to connecting devices (192.168.8.*) which probably means DHCP is enabled on it right?</p><p>What does my device A become? device A has internet and emits a wifi signal. there isn&#039;t much I can change on it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Got a different question now...have formatted using Ubuntu in Ext4 a 32GB micro SD card but i&#039;m not able to mount it on my Ravpower? No matter what i have tried i can&#039;t see it....any ideas? My ultimate setup is the following: to put media files in 2 directories, one for TV Shows and one for Movies and to access them on the Rav microsd card via Kodi from my ipad using NFS...will i be able this way to view say video files &gt;4GB, or does Ext4 has limitations? Which commands do i use to create those (once i mount successfully that is...) in my sd card via SSH? I&#039;m using Terminal on my mac to access via SSh my Ravpower with openwrt)? ps: Originally the card was formatted in exFat but i read somewhere that it&#039;s not supported by Openwrt, correct? Can i format even 64GB card via Ext4?</p>									</div>
