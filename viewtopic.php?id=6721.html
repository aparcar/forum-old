					<p>Hello.</p><p>Could someone please explain to me what I am supposed to do with the bunzip2-ed root_fs_mipsel.ext2 file that I downloaded as per the instructions found here : <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/BuildingPackagesHowTo">http://wiki.openwrt.org/BuildingPackagesHowTo</a></p><p>This file seems to contain an entire ext2 file system. I put it on a memory stick, plugged the memory stick on my router, mounted the memory stick. Now, I can see the file on the memory stick from my router, but I am unable to mount it on my router. I always get a &quot;Couldn&#039;t setup loop device&quot;.</p><p>Stan</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok.</p><p>Got it working now.<br />I had one too many ipkg package installed. It would appear you can&#039;t have both kmod-usb-ohci and kmod-usb-uhci installed at the same time.</p><p>I removed both and somehow my usb stick gets recognised by the driver?</p><p>Thanks again Macsat.</p>									</div>
