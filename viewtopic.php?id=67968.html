					<p>Hello,<br />I need to gain some experience that&#039;s why I am asking you for some help<br />I have a wireless CPE that has openwrt and with internet access and it is configured as a normal WiFi AP with wpa2-psk aes security , also I have a router with openwrt and WiFi configured with different access point name and secured, I logged in to my router and went to WiFi tab and scanned networks and I found my Wireless CPE WiFi network and I connected to it and then I finally had internet access.<br />I have several questions:<br />1. Can anyone interrupt the connection between the 2 WiFi networks and steal the WiFi password of the Wireless CPE WiFi network ?<br />2. The WiFi networks passwords can be hacked by using Kali Linux or other programs because the router is connected to my secured wireless CPE WiFi network ?<br />Thanks</p>									</div>

The rule of thumb here, for PSK, is to keep the password above 15 characters, so the possibility of cracking the password in your lifetime is less likely. </p><p>Bottom line... a nosy neighbour handy with wifi cracking tools isn&#039;t going to crack your 15 character password if WPA2 with AES encryption is implemented. As CPU power continues to increase, all bets are off in 10 years <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>
