					<p>I am trying to use device TP-Link 3020 to both connect in and connect out by WiFi. I have home WiFi network and I setup connection to it (&quot;client mode&quot;). Then I set another interface on the same radio to connect my computer to device (&quot;ap mode&quot;).</p><p>Client mode is associated with WAN and obtaining address via DHCP in space 192.168.10.1/24</p><p>AP mode is associated with LAN and distributing addresses in space 192.168.1.1/24</p><p>Everything works but until home WiFi is up. When I shut it down, both connections disappear, i.e. I am unable to connect to internet, which is normal, but also I can&#039;t see AP network to connect from computer to device, to, for example, see LUCI pages.</p><p>Why and how to overcome?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dimskraft</strong> on 30 Sep 2014, 13:16)</p>
