					<p>Hi, i&#039;m the developer of <a href="http://moblock.berlios.de">MoBlock</a>, a peerguardian-like program. You can find some more info <a href="http://forums.phoenixlabs.org/t11376-introducing-moblock.html">here</a>. I want to underline that it is NOT a simple script to load thousands of rules with iptables but a standalone program that uses a standard kernel interface and an iptables library to do his work.</p><p>I&#039;m trying to make it run on openwrt but since i don&#039;t have an openwrt ap i need someone to test it. If you want to help you will need a firmware that has the ip_queue kernel module (i don&#039;t know if it is already included in the official release) and a good knowledge of iptables.</p><p>You can find the compiled binary here: <a href="http://moblock.berlios.de/files/moblock-0.8-mips-beta1">http://moblock.berlios.de/files/moblock-0.8-mips-beta1</a> or compile it yourself, there is nothing to change from the x86 version, just set up a proper cross compile environment. I used the whiterussian rc5 SDK.</p><p>How to test it: create a block list file like guarding.p2p BUT with only few (10) lines, DON&#039;T USE A FULL guarding.p2p FILE! It will use about 16MB of ram and i don&#039;t know what happens when the router is low on memory! Upload the small block list file and the binary to the router where you can execute it.<br />Now the difficult part, where your iptables knowledge comes handy: moblock filter traffic that is QUEUEd to it through iptables, so you must use an iptables rule to &quot;send&quot; traffic to moblock. For example if you want to filter all traffic forwarded by the ap on destination port 80 tcp, you will use:</p><p>iptables -I FORWARD -p tcp --dport 80 -m state --state NEW -j QUEUE</p><p>Since i don&#039;t know what are the default rules on openwrt and since you are good in iptables so you know that it is important the ORDER of iptables rules, you will find the right place to put QUEUE rules for the traffic you want to be filtered.</p><p>Then start moblock (supposing binary and blocklist are in the same directory):</p><p>./moblock-0.8-mips-beta1 -p ./guarding.p2p moblock.log &amp;</p><p>generate some traffic that should be blocked and then with another shell into the router have a look at the logfile, it should say that it has blocked something. Kill it ( kill -TERM moblock-pid) and report here.</p><p>If it works then MoBlock will go on a diet to use as less ram as possible and cpu too, for example not storing range names.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello Morpheus,</p><p>I am really interested in integrating modblock into the official repository, since the peerguardian I have put in, seems not to work really well.</p><p>Where can I download a source, rather than a CVS snapshot ?</p><p>Tia</p>									</div>

					<p>You can download the latest official release ( 0.8 ) from <a href="http://prdownload.berlios.de/moblock/MoBlock-0.8-i586.tar.bz2">http://prdownload.berlios.de/moblock/Mo â€¦ 86.tar.bz2</a> but as i said even if it works ok it must be optimized for ram usage at least.<br />I think i will then make a separate branch for mips, stripping out everything that is not needed, with its own Makefile, releases etc...</p>									</div>

					<p>I compiled the program and tried your executable on an Asus W500g (32mb) and worked<br />pretty ok even with the full list, although I was left with 1mb free memory.
