					<p>Polpot,</p><p>I used linux. It was easy. I&#039;m not sure if it will work in Windows. If I remember well I had to use a telnet session in linux which I could keep open and then run the python script. I&#039;m not sure if that works in Windows. I checked my previous post it says:</p><p>A python script that can use mw within the u-boot software. There are a few pages. <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=54269.">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=54269.</a> In essence one opens the router with a screen command, kills the screen, but the router is already connected. Then you run a python script that just copies all the bytes to the router. And finally you copy the data to you flash memory.</p><p>The above link refers back to the following two pages: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=183315#p183315">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 15#p183315</a> and <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=149595#p149595">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 95#p149595</a>. In these posts they also used linux (command line &quot;screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200&quot;).

					<p>Hello. <br />Let me start by saying why the Soundmate M1 is not good enough for me. I bought it thinking i could connect it to my home wifi and stream from any device on my network. It doesn&#039;t work this way. And why is this a big problem? Because ALL my music is in a XPEnolgy NAS on my network. So I want to stream music that is on my NAS, from the music player on my tablet. All three devices need to see each other. I could&#039;nt care less if they are in diferent subnets, but i already changed the m1 mask to 255.255.0.0/(router also) and had to reset it because he couldn&#039;t assign an ip to any device...so I assume, best case for me is a firmware that can do that out of the box. </p><p>After reading ALL this posts still not shure if I can flash my Soundmate M1 with Airmusic NW11 Firmware. Can anyone please advise me on that. And if so, can anyone post the best firmware for NW11 working on Soundmate M1, and any original Soundmate M1 firmware.. &#039;cause I can&#039;t find anything, firm related, for Soundmate M1, and don&#039;t want to brick it without having an original Firmware for recovery. </p><p>BTW, my device is just like the on the link below, even the PCB is equal.<br />Compared photos and made all comparisons to the sreens on that page. Oh.. And my wireless led is always red, even if connected to my wireless and with my phone or table connected to the M1.<br /><a href="http://kernelreloaded.com/reverse-engineering-soundmate-m1/">http://kernelreloaded.com/reverse-engin … ndmate-m1/</a></p><p>Good linux knowledge here an reasonably advanced network knowledge here, so, hit my up with something good for every M1 owner!</p><p>Thanks in advance.

Amukinado, you describe how you want it to work, but haven&#039;t provided enough detail about your configuration.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>I could&#039;nt care less if they are in diferent subnets, but i already changed the m1 mask to 255.255.0.0/(router also) and had to reset it because he couldn&#039;t assign an ip to any device</p></blockquote></div><p>It doesn&#039;t sound like the network is setup correctly. Nothing will work if they aren&#039;t on the same network/subnet. You have to make this match. The M1 is capable of connecting to 2 networks:</p><p>1: Access Point, this is where you configure the device. I recommend that you do not change this. Only change this if you have an IP conflict with your existing network space.</p><p>2: Client. This is the existing network that your tablet and NAS are connected to. Configure in the M1 GUI, the M1 as a client to this network. Rejoin back your existing wireless network and now you should be able to see both the M1 and your NAS.</p>									</div>

					<p>Wow, these SoundMate M1s are cute and frustrating, aren&#039;t they?&nbsp; They&#039;re on Amazon for $17 each now (!!) and I decided it might be fun to play with one to try to do something which should be plenty simple.</p><p>Not only are they by far the cheapest tiny linuxy box I&#039;ve seen, but they come with decent quality audio, SPDIF, and two wifi devices built in?&nbsp; And they get power from a single USB cable?&nbsp; That&#039;s nothing to sneeze at.</p><p>Goal:&nbsp; </p><p>Forget DLNA and Airplay and such; I&#039;m trying to stream live from my house to my garage.&nbsp; Whatever&#039;s playing on my stereo or computer, I want to hook the line out to a tiny computer (I have that part planned and halfway done) which streams an mp3 or ogg stream via Icecast over my wifi. </p><p>I could try using Airplay but I&#039;m already down with Icecast and it&#039;s easy to keep it going 24/7 without human intervention.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know anything about Airplay.&nbsp; I also see mpc/mpd as a good-looking option.</p><p>I figured it would be easy enough to turn off whatever protocols would be wasting CPU ticks and install a really really basic Internet Radio player.</p><p>I would then just need to set the player to play my stream on startup and anytime the unit gets power, it should start playing moments later.</p><p>I&#039;ve been using unix/linux intermittently since college, and I can even survive in vi, so I telnetted into the box and tried to figure out how to install a player.</p><p>There&#039;s no make, no opkg, no install... is there a way to install something at all?</p><p>I found the &quot;play.shtml&quot; file in the lighttpd-based web interface but I can&#039;t get it to work.&nbsp; I figured I might be able to take advantage of whatever cgi-bin magic is supposed to play audio off of the stick, but it doesn&#039;t seem to do anything.&nbsp; It won&#039;t even list the mp3s.</p><p>So quickly stuck am I!</p><p>I am really hoping to solve this and write up a whole post with instructions.&nbsp; $17 to play your wifi music in a small attractive form factor seems like a pretty useful tool!</p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>I bought IB-MP401Air which is just OEM variant of Soundmate M2. Firmware made by Uyesee is based on OpenWRT 12.09 so it&#039;s a little outdated. I wanted to use this device especially as DLNA server and renderer but uShare available in firmware is also outdated and it even doesn&#039;t share playlists and informations about albums and artists. So I started to play with OpenWRT. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Warning: OpenWRT&nbsp; firmware for tl-wr703n-v1 has disabled radio by default so you will need to use serial cable to enable WiFi after flashing it or to use modified firmware.</p><p>I wrote ALSA compatible audio driver for AR9331 (using code for AR7240 from Qualcomm). I didn&#039;t implement support for audio codec so audio is available only on S/PDIF out but it support 16, 24 and 32 bit formats and rates up to 96 KHz. Source code is ready to release. I need only to create package for OpenWRT. </p><p>After installing mpd-mini and upmpdcli I can play http streams, .mp3 and .flac files directly from USB. MPD can be controlled in many ways, e. g. from awesome Android app MPDroid. Also I can use device as DLNA renderer.</p><p>My english isn&#039;t perfect but with little help I could prepare detailed guide how to flash, configure OpenWRT, move system to USB and configure services.</p>									</div>

					<p>Little BUMP</p><p>Hello guys.<br />I just bought soundmate wm201 (but I am pretty sure these all are pretty much the same).<br />I have the problem - in every song after 1sec is drop of volume for a few dB. I figured out it is because of EQ in soundmate. In other words - the first second (which is louder) is without any EQ, and after this is EQ applied (therefore drop of volume and tone /if some EQ curve is set/). <br />Can I disable EQ completely? In settings, I can only apply &quot;flat&quot; curve, but it is not enough. I want to disable EQ completelly (so I can listen songs without any EQ curve and without drop of volume).</p><p>Can somebody help me? thank you</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Oklep</strong> on 8 Jan 2016, 23:02)</p>
