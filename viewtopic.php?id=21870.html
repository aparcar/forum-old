					<p>Hello, since this is my first post i hope my question is not too stupid...</p><p>I&#039;m trying to get my DIR-300 to work for some time now using 8.09 and trunk. At first glance everything seems to work, but as soon as i connect the wan port lan stops working.<br />I also noticed some strange dhcp-queries transmitted by the router over the lan ports during startup when the wan is connected. The problem occurs on both, 8.09 svn branch and trunk.</p><p>I guess this is related to the ip174c switch but i couldn&#039;t find any unresolved tickets or posts hinting at what going wrong.<br />Anyone got an idea of what the problem might be?</p>									</div>
