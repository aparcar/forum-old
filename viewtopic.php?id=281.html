					<p>How about we not define OPENWRT_IPK_DIR= in this build? <br />Sooner or later that variable may be put to use by mbm and this .mk file could override it in the global scope.</p><p>It&#039;s my feeling that variables used within the pppoe should be prefixed with PPPOE_ names.</p><p>That being said. We make OPENWRT_IPK_DIR a global directive or rename the existing.</p><p>Thoughts?</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I would expect whomever is merging the patches into the CVS to make this minor change to the patches I posted.</p><p>It is a minor administrative change but it needs to be coordinated with mbm and so I do not venture to be patching the main Makefile.</p>									</div>
