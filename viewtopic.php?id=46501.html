					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am living in a remote area and need some kind high speed internet access. i have located a neighbour who is willing to share (7km) and i have tested the WLAN-Connection with an ALFA AWUS USB adapter and a TL-1043ND device. the 1043nd is connected to a satellite dish, the sharing neighbour will be equipped with a TL WR842ND.<br />I have a problem setting up the 1043nd as wireless bridge.<br />I&#039;m running the latest attitude adjustment firmware with the lucie webinterface on the device. however i set up the wireless device (i chose the 842nd because it has MIMO) i can&#039;t get a working internet connection. the router is connected to both - the host wlan and my pc. however when i try to connect to a website it always says. &quot;resolving host&quot;. ping does not work, trace route doesnt go far.</p><p>I tried different setups, also i followed this guide: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rbsh2zxPnk,">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rbsh2zxPnk,</a> however i couldnt get the connection to work.</p><p>any ideas as to how to fix this? i would be very happy to have a working internet connection for once <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>greetings<br />tilmaen</p>									</div>
