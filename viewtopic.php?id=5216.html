					<p>I updated the firmware in my WR850GV2 router.&nbsp; It seems to be fine except I can&#039;t access the router.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t respond to any of the IP address.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I bricked, but you never know.&nbsp; It had a static IP before I flashed it.&nbsp; It was also using 6.14.&nbsp; I still get a power light(solid), wireless light(flashes), and a port number light(flashes).&nbsp; </p><p>Does that seem like I messed it up or just not getting the right IP addy?</p>									</div>
