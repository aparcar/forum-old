					<p>you can easily do this with DNS, but I dont know what&#039;s the easy way to block a specific device, </p><p>but surely this can be done using NXFILTER which is a separate program daemon and I doubt that any cheap soho router can run this since it requires a minimum of 512megs of ram, it has a policy based DNS blocking. in your case ill just add a custom blacklist domain containing youtube.com and *.googlevideo.com and then assign that blacklist to a specific user, and whoala, no more youtube for that kid.</p><p>of course you can just add this 2 domain on your DNSMASQ config to block all youtube access in any device connected on your network, still android had some sneaky things happening on the background since sometimes it doesnt use your router&#039;s DNS server and instead use the google DNS servers instead so this is why you need to add a custom firewall to force redirect all port 53 traffic on that device.</p>									</div>
