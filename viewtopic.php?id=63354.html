					<p>I&#039;ve been setting up a vlan trunk between two BT Home Hub 5A&#039;s.&nbsp; (<a href="https://wikidevi.com/wiki/BT_Home_Hub_5">https://wikidevi.com/wiki/BT_Home_Hub_5</a>)</p><p>I&#039;ve managed to setup my vlans and setup a trunk, but the trunk will only be stable if it&#039;s on the eth0 interface (4 external facing port switch, with device ID&#039;s 0,1,2,4 with CPU @ 6.</p><p>On one homehub I&#039;ve set up vlan1 on ports 4 and 2 (External ports 1 and 2), and vlan2 on port 0 (External port 3).&nbsp; I&#039;ve setup port 1 (External port 4) as a trunk.&nbsp; </p><p>On the other homehub, I&#039;ve setup the trunk on port 1 (External port 4), and ports 4, 2, and 0 (External 1,2, and 3) for vlan2.</p><p>On both hubs, I have segregated wifi running providing access to both vlans.</p><p>Each homehub has a WAN port.&nbsp; This is where the confusion starts.&nbsp; When using Luci for configuring the switches, this WAN port comes up as port 5 on the switch.&nbsp; This switch, as far as I am aware, runs on device eth0.&nbsp; The kernel messages when disconnecting and connecting to these ports list eth0.x as the link.&nbsp; However, when I connect and disconnect from the WAN port, this comes up in the kernel messages as eth1. </p><p>Ideally I want to&nbsp; run the trunk over the wan port, for consistency and to avoid the use of another unmanaged switch on both the home hubs (I have a lot of gear needing networked up). </p><p>I did try running the trunk on the wan port, by bridging the vlan interfaces to eth1.1 and eth1.2.&nbsp; This worked but proved extremely unreliable.&nbsp; </p><p>I&#039;m so confused here.&nbsp; Why is the Wan port showing up as port 5 on the eth0 switch (and Luci will show the correct port status as part of the Lantiq xrx200 switch on device eth0), but the kernel messages throw up eth1 when disconnecting/connecting.&nbsp; Also, using it as a trunk under eth1.x works to a tiny degree.&nbsp; I think whatever explains this would also solve why the Wan port is so unstable as a trunk.</p><p>Any insight would be greatly appreciated.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>connchri</strong> on 14 Mar 2016, 12:33)</p>

					<p>im not sure, but seems like P5 is an external gphy connected to the internal P5 rgmii port, it can explain why it&#039;s a separate interface but shows status as p5<br />for better unterstanding you need your soc docs and board schematics</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok doke, I&#039;ll look into this in more depth when I get some time. </p><p>What I did find out about half an hour ago though is that this issue is only affecting one of the home hubs.&nbsp; The one I&#039;m using in the office - essentially only a glorified switch with wifi access points, is fine.&nbsp; I can, and I am, using the Wan port (as eth0, port 5) for the vlan trunk.&nbsp; It appears it&#039;s only on the home hub that is also doing the internet, firewall, dhcp, that is not playing ball with this port.&nbsp; It leads me to think that there is some conflict between that port and the internet connection.</p><p>With stock firmware, you can either use that wan port with a external modem, or you can use the built in modem.&nbsp; In either case, the virtual interface for the modem, and this wan port, would become the interface for dialing out off. </p><p>Is there anywhere else in OpenWRT where interfaces can be configured or defined besides the /etc/config/network file?&nbsp; A quick google and look about the documentation hasn&#039;t help.&nbsp; It could be that somehow this port still linked to the modem/bridge/call-it-what-you-will that prevents it acting like a normal port when the ADSL modem is in use.</p><p>Thanks for the help.</p><p>Chris.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>connchri</strong> on 14 Mar 2016, 15:23)</p>

					<p>I&#039;ve been trying to use a HH5 as a switch+AP (no xDSL). I&#039;ve tried bridging eth1 and the eth0 switch together to get an extra LAN port but without success. The WAN port just won&#039;t work for me. The set-up with port 5 showing on the eth0 switch yet also as eth1 is bizarre.</p>									</div>
