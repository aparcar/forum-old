					<p>I&#039;m running a TL-MR3020. I am overseas at the moment. A friend who owns the cafe underneath my room has graciously allowed me to use her wifi full time. Unfortunately, the signal is only strong in a certain part of the room. With the small MR3020 I got, I wanted to place it where the signal is strong so it can transmit with no problem to the rest of the room. I&#039;ve looked through the tutorials and YouTube videos for walkthrough videos but none of them seem to mention inputting the host router information. I was able to accomplish this with the stock TP-LINK firmware before I switched over to OpenWRT so I can eventually use OpenVPN. I can&#039;t figure out how to get this done.</p>									</div>
