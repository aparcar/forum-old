					<p>I have an Ubiquity XR2 radio in a Soekris net4521 board that seems to have low output power. Are there any specific settings I should configure to ensure maximum output power? My country is US. Operating in 802.11 2.4GHz ISM band. I&#039;m trying to use this in a long range configuration.</p><p>So far I have set diversity=0, txantenna=1, rxantenna=1 and limited the Tx Rate to 6Mbps. distance is set to 5000 meters.</p><p>Gus</p>									</div>

					<p>I have an extensive writeup on the Ubiquiti forum, but here is the important part:</p><p>This is definitely a software issue.</p><p>I acquired a Soekris net4521 (x86 based board) and built two images for it.<br />The first image was OpenWRT trunk r20838 using the provided madwifi<br />(2009-05-08). Testing with that image showed no change from previous<br />test results. Consider this baseline.</p><p>The second image was kamikaze_7.09 using the ubnt_hal and the<br />instructions on the Ubiquiti Wiki &quot;Building_Radio_Driver_for_OpenWrt&quot;.</p><p>By using the old ubnt_hal I got about 3-4dB improvement over the current<br />OpenWRT trunk. There is still a lot of signal missing but this proves<br />that there are&nbsp; issues with the XR2 card families and the OpenWRT madwifi.</p><p>This is a serious problem because the Router Station boards ship with<br />OpenWRT and could be considered defective because they can&#039;t run the XR2<br />cards to full power. Or you could consider the XR2 cards defective,<br />depending on how you want to look at it.</p><p>Either way it warrants a bug report.</p><p>Gus</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gwirth</strong> on 14 Apr 2010, 08:20)</p>

Also remember that it may be illegal to turn the power up as much as you are suggesting. Most countries have a 100mW power limit for 802.11a/b/g/n</p>									</div>
