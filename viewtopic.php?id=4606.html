					<p>Oh, and you also need to add these compile time config options to make the usb config you have on your website legit:</p><p>BR2_PACKAGE_CIFSMOUNT=y<br />BR2_PACKAGE_DOSFSTOOLS=y<br />BR2_PACKAGE_E2FSPROGS=y<br />BR2_TARGET_ROOTFS_JFFS2=y<br />BR2_PACKAGE_KMOD_FS_CIFS=y<br />BR2_PACKAGE_KMOD_FS_EXT2=y<br />BR2_PACKAGE_KMOD_FS_EXT3=y<br />BR2_PACKAGE_KMOD_FS_NFS=y<br />BR2_PACKAGE_KMOD_FS_VFAT=y</p><p>Sorry to forget to include them the first time around.</p><p>I also noticed that from your more recent configs you&#039;ve removed many of the busybox utility options altogether, and was hoping you could add some back that were rather essential.&nbsp; IMHO some key elements that would be very nice to have:</p><p>BUSYBOX_CONFIG_STTY=y<br />BUSYBOX_CONFIG_TTY=y<br />BUSYBOX_CONFIG_GETTY=y</p><p>Very nice to be able to specify columns, rows, and have access to the line paramaters.&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />&nbsp; Also, nice to be able to stick a getty on the serial line.</p><br /><p>BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_MTAB_SUPPORT=y</p><p>For whatever reason /proc/mounts seems hosey, so i&#039;m hoping the above option will improve providing an accurate picture of live mounts.</p><p>Out of convenience it would be nice to have these two additional utilities as default:</p><p>BUSYBOX_CONFIG_MODPROBE=y<br />BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FDISK=y</p><p>For usb drive users, these utilities are imperative since 32 megs doesn&#039;t go very far on a storage router and swap space can become key:</p><p>BUSYBOX_CONFIG_MKSWAP=y<br />BUSYBOX_CONFIG_SWAPONOFF=y</p><p>&#039;y&#039; since it&#039;s all or nothing when it comes to busybox options.</p><p>Thanks again yasha!</p><p>Oh and don&#039;t forget the post your configs!&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Ydef</strong> on 1 Mar 2006, 10:35)</p>
