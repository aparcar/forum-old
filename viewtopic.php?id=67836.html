					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;ve been struggling with running OpenWrt ARM images on qemu for awhile now and I think I should really ask some questions at this point to clear up my misunderstandings.&nbsp; I&#039;m on Ubuntu, by the way.</p><p>I clone the buildroot repository for OpenWrt, enter ~/openwrt/, select the ARMv8 Multiplatform target, makedefconfig, update and install feeds, run menuconfig and add a few packages/utils (tcpdump, some disk/file system operations in busybox, and my own project I&#039;m trying to port), and start the build.&nbsp; It builds fine.</p><p>The output in ~/openwrt/bin/arm64 includes the following files:</p><ul><li><p>openwrt-arm64-qemu-virt.Image</p></li><li><p>openwrt-arm64-qemu-virt-initramfs.Image</p></li><li><p>openwrt-arm64-vexpress-foundation.axf</p></li></ul><p>The page on virtualizing openwrt with Qemu gives this instruction:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>qemu-system-aarch64 -machine virt -cpu cortex-a57 -machine type=virt -nographic \
-smp 1 -m 2048 \
-kernel bin/arm64/openwrt-arm64-qemu-virt-initramfs.Image \
--append &quot;console=ttyAMA0&quot;</code></pre></div><p>I really only tried using the .Image files, but that extension is unfamiliar to me.</p><p>I&#039;m trying to get it to a place where I can have a virtual system that has a mountable, writable file system that I can manipulate outside of Qemu (this is for research, but it&#039;s probably boring so I won&#039;t go into it).</p><p>So, I&#039;ve noticed that it doesn&#039;t seem to matter whether I pass openwrt-arm64-qemu-virt.Image or openwrt-arm64-qemu-virt-initramfs.Image as the kernel argument.&nbsp; That means that I can&#039;t have any settings or configuration files other than the default ones from when the image is built because there&#039;s no persistent file system.</p><p>I&#039;ve fiddled around with block mount, fstab configurations, and passing -device and -drive options with a disk image file to use as the file system, but since any changes I make to the configuration files or init scripts revert back to the default on shutting down or rebooting.&nbsp; As such, I can&#039;t change the scripts at boot to call switch_root/pivot_root to follow the extroot instructions. I&#039;m at a loss, here.</p><p>So, what I&#039;m asking is... </p><ul><li><p>What&#039;s the difference between the openwrt-arm64-qemu-virt.Image and openwrt-arm64-qemu-virt-initramfs.Image files?</p></li><li><p>How can I get a persistent root file system for this target?</p></li><li><p>Is what I&#039;m trying to do possible, and does what I&#039;m describing make sense?</p></li><li><p>Is there any further reading than what&#039;s on the &quot;OpenWrt in Qemu&quot; page that gives more explanation and detail?</p></li><li><p>Is there a better way to run an ARM-based OpenWrt image on a VM? (realview has some serious issues, namely that I can only have 1 network port)</p></li></ul><p>Thanks for your time, and anyone who can help me out here would be my savior.</p>									</div>

-smp 1 -m 2048 \
-kernel openwrt-arm64-qemu-virt.Image \
-drive file=openwrt-arm64-root.ext4,if=none,id=sd0,format=raw \
-device virtio-blk-device,drive=sd0 \
--append &quot;root=/dev/vda</code></pre></div><p>When I add a virtual drive with an ext4 disk image in it (and a -device argument to go along with it because it gets ignored as &quot;orphaned&quot; otherwise), it shows up on <strong>/dev/vda</strong>.</p><p>I get that it&#039;s because it&#039;s going in as a virtual device, but with the way I&#039;m more used to (qemu-system-arm -M realview-eb-mpcore ...&lt;options options options&gt;... -sd openwrt-root-ext4 --append &quot;root=/dev/mmcblk0&quot;), the image passed to the -sd arg shows up on /dev/mmcblk0 and appending &quot;root=/dev/mmcblk0&quot; gets it to properly boot with that image as the root file system.</p><p>In the aarch64 case above, if I do that, it just creates /dev/root as a simlink pointing to /dev/vda (like /dev/root -&gt; /dev/vda), but it&#039;s not the root file system.&nbsp; Like, this is what I get for a few commands to check what&#039;s mounted and such:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/# df -h
