It has been working without any problems for month, but yesterday sth strange happend. This is what is usually in /var/log/messages:</p><p>Mar 10 19:48:23 BorderGW user.notice ez-ipupdate: ez-ipupdate Version 3.0.11b8 <br />Mar 10 19:48:23 BorderGW user.notice ez-ipupdate: Copyright (C) 1998-2001 Angus Mackay <br />Mar 10 19:48:23 BorderGW user.notice ez-ipupdate: connected to members.dyndns.org (63.208.196.94) on port 80 <br />Mar 10 19:48:41 BorderGW user.notice ez-ipupdate: request successful </p><p>next day:</p><p>Mar 11 08:36:34 BorderGW user.notice ez-ipupdate: ez-ipupdate Version 3.0.11b8 <br />Mar 11 08:36:34 BorderGW user.notice ez-ipupdate: Copyright (C) 1998-2001 Angus Mackay <br />Mar 11 08:36:34 BorderGW user.notice ez-ipupdate: connected to members.dyndns.org (63.208.196.94) on port 80 <br />Mar 11 08:37:16 BorderGW user.notice ez-ipupdate: error recv()ing reply: Connection reset by peer <br />Mar 11 08:37:16 BorderGW user.notice ez-ipupdate: strange server response, are you connecting to the right server? </p><p>since then:</p><p>Mar 11 20:56:43 BorderGW user.notice ez-ipupdate: ez-ipupdate Version 3.0.11b8 <br />Mar 11 20:56:43 BorderGW user.notice ez-ipupdate: Copyright (C) 1998-2001 Angus Mackay <br />Mar 11 20:59:52 BorderGW user.notice ez-ipupdate: connect: Connection timed out <br />Mar 11 20:59:52 BorderGW user.notice ez-ipupdate: error connecting to members.dyndns.org:80</p><p>or:</p><p>Mar 12 13:35:51 BorderGW kern.notice ez-ipupdate[26262]: error connecting to members.dyndns.org:80 <br />Mar 12 13:35:51 BorderGW kern.notice ez-ipupdate[26262]: failed to update ppp0-&gt;[IP] [DNS]</p><p>I did not change anything, no playing around with iptables or anything. DNS seems to be fine as well, and since i didn&#039;t get any note of my account being terminated or suspended, i am kinda out of ideas.

					<p>DDoS Attack on members.dyndns.org [1]<br />Sat, 10 Mar 2007 22:55<br />As of March 9th, 17:00 UTC, members.dyndns.org has been subject to a number of Distributed Denial of Service attacks. DynDNS Administrators have been taking a number of steps to try to mitigate and minimize the impact of the attack. As of March 10th, 17:00 UTC, steps were taken to isolate our main website, <a href="http://www.dyndns.com">www.dyndns.com</a>, out of the line of fire of the attack. We&#039;re continuing to analyze and evaluate the situation, however, customers may experience periods where update clients are unable to update DNS hostnames. Customers should simply re-try their update.<br />We&#039;ll continue to post updates to this situation as they become available.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.dyndns.com/news/status/">https://www.dyndns.com/news/status/</a></p>									</div>
