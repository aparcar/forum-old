					<p>Hi,<br />I was quite excited to spend some time on raspberry Pi 2 B and install open wrt on it, I have done that and spent few hours experimenting with it, </p><p>When I wanted to install multwan packages, I could not find any packages in the updated list, I could not find them in the source repo as well, </p><p>for example I searched here and could not find luci-app-multiwan etc </p><p><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05.1/brcm2708/bcm2709/packages/luci">http://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calm â€¦ kages/luci</a></p><p>So my question is why these packages are available for arm7 etc but not for raspberry pi ?</p><p>is there some sort of incompatibility or is this some build issue ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>code.compile.link</strong> on 15 Jul 2016, 23:44)</p>

					<p>When the image was generated, the menu options selected did not include any of the &#039;missing&#039; packages. You can build your own version from stable or trunk and select luci ( have to install the luci feed in buildroot ) and any other binaries you want to include in the menu configuration.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, I have never build open wrt before but is it possible to build only one package and use it without rebuilding entire project ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>code.compile.link</strong> on 16 Jul 2016, 18:15)</p>
