					<p>Not sure if I&#039;m even posting in the correct forum for this. A few things first...</p><p>1. I am a complete n00b and probably shouldn&#039;t even be attempting this.<br />2.

Maybe it is because I have zer0 experience with *nix. I want to know if possible how to properly backup the OEM firmware and attempt a flash of open-wrt+x-wrt to this device. It doesn&#039;t seem there is much, if any, info out there on this particular device. <br />3. If someone could post a link (I&#039;m not asking you to write one for me I just haven&#039;t had much luck finding one) to a tutorial geared towards someone with little/no experience.

					<p>I have explored this model over serial. I am currently running John the Ripper to determine the password it requires for that, but I also hacked the firmware not to need that password. I made copies of the portions of the existing flash contents accessible to the stock kernel<strong>s</strong> (both of them), but I will need to JTAG it to grab the rest, which for all I know, may simply be a bunch of zeroes. Perhaps the adm5120 port of OpenWRT may support this model eventually.
