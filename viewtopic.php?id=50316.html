					<p>Greetings,</p><p>I was cleaning out my closet today and found my old <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrtsl54gs">WRTSL54GS</a> that I modified to have five USB 2.0 ports (one is original, four are connected to a hub via. an unused header, a total of four ports are external). I was previously using this router as a cheap, low-powered off-site backup solution until I replaced it with an Intel Atom-based system with software RAID. Today I flashed it with Attitude Adjustment (12.09) and confirmed it was stable by letting it serve as my router/gateway during a several-hour gaming session.</p><p>Would anyone be interested in this device? They sell for ~$30 USD on ebay.</p><p>Cheers,<br />Brian</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bkloppenborg</strong> on 10 May 2014, 04:34)</p>
