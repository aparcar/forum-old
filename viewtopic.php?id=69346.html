					<p>Hello,</p><p>we are building a router with a touch-screen interface and are trying to standup a toolchain to develop a natve UI application.</p><p>We are considering several approaches - a local browser running a node.js web app - requires we build FireFox or equivalent.</p><p>Second choice would be the electron framework: electron.atom.io</p><p>Or if we cannot stand that up - a native GTK+ application.</p><p>In all cases we require full X11 support - is there someone in the community who would be willing to help (paid consulting) stand this up for us, please? I think having a maintained X11 package will become more and more necessary as routers (at least high-end) are already getting touch-screens.</p><p>Thank you,<br />Dejan Nenov d[at]panaton[dot]com</p>									</div>
