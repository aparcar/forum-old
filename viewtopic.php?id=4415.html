					<p>According to the FAQ, the power displays 255 by default, even though it&#039;s capped by the driver &quot;unless you enable override&quot;.</p><p>Now, I&#039;ve installed the wl package. When I enter wl txpwr1 it responds by telling me that it&#039;s transmitting at 251mW, which as the FAQ states is incorrect. What I&#039;m most confused about is what is it capped to? <strong>nvram get pa0maxpwr</strong> on my unit lists 0x4e, or 78 in decimal. Does that mean my wrt is transmitting at 78mW? If I change the power to 78 using <strong>wl txpwr1 -m 78</strong> will I still be transmitting at 78mW, or will I be transmitting at some frational value of 78 (ie, does 255 corespond directly to 255mW, or does it follow something like ActualTXpwr=SetTXpwr*78/255?).</p><p>One of the reasons I ask is because all other firmwares I&#039;ve tried have listed 28mW as the default value, but it looks to me that OpenWRT is using 78mW as the default value. I&#039;d really like to know what this is actually transmitting at.</p>									</div>

					<p>The 255 means &quot;try to set the driver to 255mW&quot; .. the driver rejects this and sets the power at the maximum, pa0maxpwr.</p><p>It&#039;s also worth pointing out (again, from the FAQ) that increasing the transmit power does not automatically improve your range, the AP may transmit further but the client will not send any stronger signal back to the AP. A much better solution is to change the antennas on the ap (and/or the client) to directional antennas which will give you a gain, amplifying both the signal transmitted and the signal received.</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenWrt makes no decisions as to what the power is set to.&nbsp; The values setting the transmit power are in NVRAM before you put OpenWrt on and the binary-only non-OpenWrt-originated driver reads these values and acts on them.&nbsp; </p><p>The only difference is that OpenWrt does not hide it from you like the other firmwares try to do (resulting in your confusion).</p>									</div>

					<p>the later linksys wrt54g models, like v3.1, use SiGe&#039;s Power Amplifier 2528L; it&#039;s the little 16 pin IC next to the BCM2050 radio under the sheet metal cover.<br />Application note: <a href="http://www.sige.com/support/files/application/SE2528L_Application_0.1.pdf">http://www.sige.com/support/files/appli … on_0.1.pdf</a></p><p>Spec of the PA is 24 dBm in 802.11b and 21 dBm 802.11g.&nbsp; Hence some more than 19 dBm should be possible, but perhaps only with hardware (PA bias) changes. Would the supply voltage of the third amplifier stage be 5 V then an extra 2 dB are in the spec for g mode. Beyond that the Error Vector Magnitude deteriorates (phase errors which degrade g mode performance). Can confirm experimentally that unmodified any setting beyond appr. 75 mW may show in iwconfig or wl txpwr1 but in actual fact does not happen.<br />Note that these power values are momentary power; as the link needs to be receiving as well and is not duplex the long-term average power is considerably less.</p><p>A possibility that I cannot completely rule out is that the system is actually doing the full 21 dBm but is reporting less. After all the values reported from the software are anything but calibrated measurements. Unfortunately I do not have the equipment to measure power reliably at 2.4 GHz.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>doddel</strong> on 11 Mar 2006, 00:34)</p>

					<p>&gt; Increasing power is not a pointless exercise in one very good example.</p><p>more important is &quot;radiated power&quot;, than output power. If you get more output power from WiFi radio, mean that you produce more heat and noise, nothing more. If you look with spectrum analyzer, then above 80 mW, signal from almost every WiFi transmitter goes wider (producing additional noise for sidechannels), but actual power reading remains almost same. And even, if you somehow can rise power from 32mW (15dBm) to 250mW (24dBm), then radiated power difference with same antenna will be only 9dB. Just use better antenna and get extra 9dB and maybe more, with less noise and heat. Up to 100mW output power is usable, when you are in the wild, already using maximal possible antenna gain, and need just a little more signal strength for a very long link. 250mW is pointless and is usable only for fooling people.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>netmaster</strong> on 12 Mar 2006, 17:49)</p>

					<p>My point was, the vast majority of people who ask about this are n00bs.</p><p>Do they apply high-gain antenna first? No. Do they optimize other aspects of their operation first? No. They go straight for increasing transmit power with the rubber ducky units so they can fool themselves that they are getting better reception on their laptop with it&#039;s 30 mW card and stubby antenna. Because they see more bars in the signal meter on the client laptop, they are convinced that they have actually done something COOL.</p><p>If you are doing point-to-point with high-gain antenna, you have a valid reason for it. But I see no reason for making it easy for people, given this option most will just increase the local interference problems by a factor of 9 for no useful purpose.</p>									</div>
