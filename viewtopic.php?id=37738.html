					<p>Hi everyone <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>For my university seminar I am required to code a wireless sniffer with the following capabilities:<br />- going into managed mode<br />- scan all available networks to get the channels where traffic is<br />- going into monitor mode<br />- sniff for a specified time interval on each channel and capture the MAC addresses of all senders</p><p>I first tried to get my code on an Asus WL-500g Premium v2, but the OpenWRT Version with Kernel 2.4 did not supply monitor mode, so I switched to a Fonera 2100.</p><p>The Problem is, that I can enable monitor mode manually via console, but not in my code.<br />This is a hard requirement though, as the sniffer should run independently for many hours and submit the results to a remote machine (Research Target is indoor localisation).</p><p>On my laptop the code works, but the wireless libraries on the fonera do not seem to work the same way.</p><p>Can anyone point me to a solution where I can enable monitor/managed mode from within my C code at will (+ the scanning)?<br />I will attach my code so anyone can see what I did up to now: <a href="http://pastebin.com/ChLs1gr5">http://pastebin.com/ChLs1gr5</a></p><p>Thank you in advance <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Did you manage to get this working, I have a project that requires something similar. Would you be able to share some information with me please?</p><p>Specifically, I need to scan each channel for a specified time capturing the MAC address &amp; signal strength; then later send those to a remote machine (web-service).<br />This sounds very similar to what you&#039;re trying to do and it&#039;d be great to collaborate?</p>									</div>
