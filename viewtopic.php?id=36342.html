					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I installed OpenWrt 10.03.1 on my TP-Link TL-WR1043ND and was pleasently surprised how easy it was. However, I have some problems that are not covered by the wiki or the forum so far.</p><p>I live in a student dorm and can only access the internet if I build a VPN-tunnel to the VPN-gateway of my university. Until I bought the router I could easily connect from my PC using the official Cisco AnyConnect client or openconnect. Now, I want the router to build the tunnel and share it with all devices in my LAN. So I downloaded the openconnect package and its dependencies, scp&#039;d them onto the router and installed them. I also acquired a vpnc-script form the openconnect homepage. Finally, I wrote an init script:</p><p>#!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common<br /># Copyright (C) 2006 OpenWrt.org<br />START=49</p><p>start() {<br />echo &quot;PASS&quot; | openconnect -s /etc/vpnc-script -u USER -i tun0 --no-cert-check --passwd-on-stdin -b SERVER<br />}</p><p>stop() {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; killall openconnect<br />}</p><p>Now I have a connection from the router to the internet, but it is slower then a connection from my PC. Also, it fails to load some pages that are loaded if I connect from my PC (through the router).</p><p>Any ideas how I can find out whats going wrong?</p><p>Regards,<br />Schlaxx</p><p>P.S. I&#039;m new to OpenWrt, so take into account that I may have made some stupid mistake :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, looks like I played around with the arguments for openconnect a little too much, nevermind. The init script should work.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not sure if your second post is saying that you&#039;ve solved *all* the problems you talked about in the first.</p><p>If not, please see <a href="http://www.infradead.org/openconnect/mail.html">http://www.infradead.org/openconnect/mail.html</a></p>									</div>
