					<p>Unfortunately this is all information in the net I can found for this routers. TPL is for WR740N and upper models. For those old routers seem that have some U-Boot password which is unknown or not published. I found this bootloop reported in dd-wrt forum but nothing. I suggest you to re-read again what I posted and think about programmer (programming directly the chip). This is all you can do for your routers. TP-LINK will not provide you information because this is secret, they tell me when I asked.</p><p>Sorry for the bad news. If you want and have free time go to read about programmer and try it. Else just buy another router as 740N if you don&#039;t want to buy expensive router. This one(740N) is openwrt supported and it&#039;s pretty chip.&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
