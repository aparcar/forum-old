					<p>Hello! I&#039;m pretty new to the whole open wrt world but consoles and line commands are my friends, so I guess I can survive.<br />I received a faulty TM-02 (kept disconnecting after few minutes, than needed to rest powerless to be able to connect again, no reset available). I tried updating the firmware, but instead of fixing I seem to have bricked it (steady blu light, no wifi).<br />Luckyly my seller sent me a replacement without asking me te return the faulty one so I was wondering if I can experiment a bit with the bricked one before dumping it but I need I few info: given that the unit is bricked, if I solder the USB--&gt;serial cable, will I be able to tfpd it? Or should I try the flashing clamp? I have none of them but I can ask some friends or buy one just for playing around. Tftp seemed easier to me, but it&#039;s unclear to me if the bootloader will answer once I solder the four pins with a bricked unit. Obviously, since the unit was faulty as it was sold, I am aware it could be an hardware problem and flashing the chip wont help me at all... but it&#039;s going to be dumped so I would give it a try just for learning. <br />As a side note, I was wondering why I cannot connect to the bootloader to upload the file from the ethernet as suggested <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.flashing.tftp">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.flashing.tftp</a> ?<br />Thank you for any suggestion,<br />Lila</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>liladude</strong> on 10 Sep 2015, 07:02)</p>

					<p>For the moment put OpenVPN aside.&nbsp; With 1 radio in the device you must set the channel, width and bands the same on both sides.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am not sure if you need the security params the same, but mine are.&nbsp; The key can be different.&nbsp; &nbsp;If your router is set as a Router and not AP, then you should pretty much be able to connect.</p><p>Search the wiki for bridged mode client issues.&nbsp; It&#039;s basically the same problem.&nbsp; To make this an AP your need relayd, but we want a router for OpenVPN.&nbsp; </p><p>In practice, you do not know what channel the AP/Wifi your HooToo client will need to connect is on.

					<p>Let me try to explain what I think is going on.&nbsp; When the hootoo (and perhaps other single-radio OpenWRT devices) is configured to boot up as a travel router, i.e. with both WWAN and WLAN activated (behind the scenes, the WWAN is likely using the default radio instance, and the WLAN is using the virtual second instance), and the WWAN doesn&#039;t connect (e.g. because you have changed hotels, and it has a different SSID), well, then the virtual SSID doesn&#039;t come up, and you cannot connect wirelessly to the hootoo to reconfigure the WWAN.</p><p>The reason the same hardware works as a travel router with the default firmware is that--this is my assumption, having not been able to review the OEM software--when the device boots up, it always boots up into a mode where both the wifi and ethernet are bridged, and the wifi is configured to be a WLAN.&nbsp; This allows you to connect on the LAN side (either wirelessly or via ethernet), search for a SSID to serve as the WWAN, then restart the wifi connection (not the whole router) into WWAN+WLAN.&nbsp; </p><p>Using the pure OpenWRT build, I&#039;m sure something similar could be done via scripting, but I have never tried.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>klaberte</strong> on 16 Sep 2015, 17:51)</p>

					<p>RangerZ, let me try with another example.&nbsp; Let&#039;s say you have a hootoo that, the last time it was used, had been connected on Channel 1 using a hotel&#039;s SSID=HOTEL1.&nbsp; Now you get to a new hotel which has SSID=HOTEL2 on Ch6.&nbsp; Using the default firmware on the hootoo, when you power it up, it has erased the HOTEL1 from its memory and starts broadcasting its own SSID=HT02, let&#039;s say, on Channel 11 (it doesn&#039;t matter which channel, your Windows machine will be scanning all channels to find SSID&#039;s it recognizes).&nbsp; The hootoo is making no attempt to connect its WWAN at this point.</p><p>So, you connect your computer to HT02 (on Channel 11), then, using the original firmware, do a scan for other SSIDs.&nbsp; The hootoo does the scan, and reports back that there is a SSID of HOTEL2 (coincidentally, on Ch6).&nbsp; You select this SSID to be your internet provider.</p><p>Now, the hootoo brings down its wifi connection, then reconfigures itself to have WWAN via HOTEL2 on Ch6, and also, configures a VSSID=HT02 in AP mode, also on Ch6.&nbsp; After a short while, your computer reconnects to HT02 (now on Ch6), and the hootoo routes your traffic to its WWAN on SSID HOTEL2, also on Ch6.</p><p>I cannot be certain this is exactly how it is implemented, as I cannot review the code, but I would bet a fair amount that something like this is implemented in the original hootoo firmware.&nbsp; Something very similar is done using the GL-iNet app if you are using a 6414 instead of the hootoo.</p><p>TL;DR=Your computer will find the HT02 SSID, regardless of what channel it is on.&nbsp; You don&#039;t need to configure the channel, just have the hootoo do a wireless scan, and then you choose which SSID you want to use on the WWAN side.&nbsp; The device (either hootoo or 6414) shuts down its wifi, magically reconfigures itself correctly, then brings the WWAN+WLAN up for your wifi enjoyment.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>klaberte</strong> on 17 Sep 2015, 03:12)</p>

</p><p>Just so you don&#039;t get the wrong idea, I do understand that AP+STA does not work correctly with OpenWrt on the TM02 (it does work by using no encryption on the STA side however).&nbsp; I now know that AP+AP works (though is useless to me) and I still would like to see if going from AP+AP to AP+STA by scanning may work in some way.&nbsp; However, getting encryption working on both sides, seems to be the problem with AP+STA, so I plan to move on from here to use the USB2Wifi adapter when it arrives.</p>									</div>
