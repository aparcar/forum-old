					<p>Hi, today I did git pull, script feeds updated, all in my usual lede folder to compile current trunk and after flashing and ssh into router (tp link wr841n v13) I realized that I have openwrt snapshot logo instead of the lede logo.</p><p>So what&#039;s up? Openwrt and lede are friends again and merging back to one project, or I have screwed big and by some miracle I put openwrt into lede forlder somehow? It would not be bad news of course, but I&#039;m curious what happened. Thanks.</p><p>edit, I found this: <a href="https://forum.lede-project.org/t/openwrt-lede-merger-when/5527/31">https://forum.lede-project.org/t/openwr … en/5527/31</a></p><p>What I don&#039;t understand, if there is (will be) any difference when I&#039;ll use git openwrt or git lede? Wr841n v13 is still work in progress so I need the latest patches. Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 30 Dec 2017, 14:46)</p>

					<p>Hi, today I wanted to do a fresh start, openwrt this time, went by lede manual <a href="https://lede-project.org/docs/guide-developer/the-source-code">https://lede-project.org/docs/guide-dev … ource-code</a>, but the usual scripts </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>./scripts/feeds/update -a
