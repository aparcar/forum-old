					<p>dlang,</p><p>as long as the clone uses a different usbid I don&#039;t count it as a counterfeit. Talk about not violating IP is hair splitting. The Linux driver is open source and if another vendor wants to use it with it&#039;s own VID that&#039;s perfectly legit. But better just comply to the CDC standard and you don&#039;t need a specific / proprietary driver in the first place.</p><p>I read up on the breaking hardware by the official driver you stated. It just changes PID and it&#039;s trivial for the tech safey to change it back or force load an official FTDI driver with the new PID. It&#039;s not much different than breaking hardware as LEDE does with not accepting OEM firmware via GUI.</p>									</div>

First the patch adding the powertables for mwlwifi can&#039;t be upstreamed until the mwlwifi driver is mainlined, then the swconfig patch is inherently OpenWrt specific but there is the better option of DSA anyway so distributions have little use for that one. Most distros are also using glibc which means the musl compat patches can be ignored by them as well. So if it weren&#039;t for mwlwifi a vanilla kernel 4.13 could be used just fine. Meaning you can use pretty much any Linux distribution out of the box. For 4.11 I still carry some 30 additional patches on top.</p><p>Unpatched mwlwifi is only compatible with kernels up to 4.11, I filed bugs for that one. Once mwlwifi is mainlined Linksys&#039; &quot;opensource ready&quot; becomes &quot;opensource supported&quot;.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello everyone , FNG on here and just picked up an WRT1900AC V1. It was on clearance at Walmart for $60 so I couldn&#039;t just pass on the deal. So a friend recommended I install OpenWRT on this router so I did some looking around the interweb. Came across this forum and thread. Unfortunately it&#039;s almost 600 pages deep and I just can&#039;t find myself reading through all 600. Lazy? Maybe but some of the posts were just not significant to what I&#039;m researching into. So that leads me to ask. Are there any known issues to the firmware should I decide to flash OpenWRT on this said model? Another person I know who has the ACS version said that my model has been know to have issues and I wanted to come in here to maybe get confirmation. I&#039;m mostly intending to use this just exclusively for wifi devices and streaming Netflix and such. No gaming as I have another router for that in my home network. Who knows if I find it to be stable I may end up using it for gaming as well since I&#039;ve heard some high praise for SQM. So that&#039;s my story pretty much. In conclusion I want to find out really the stability of the firmware ( latest or old ). Looking forward to y&#039;all replies and I&#039;m happy to be apart of this community. Thank you for your time.</p>									</div>

					<p>Wiki Question.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been on here for a while, but still running 15.01.5 because I wanted something really stable, (and normally I usually get 20 days or so before a lock up/reboot) ... but lately its almost everyday (not sure what has changed) but decided to look at what the new &quot;stable&quot; release was, and according to the wiki its still 15.01.5 ... is that right?&nbsp; There has been so many builds lately that I thought there was definitely something newer/stablier?&nbsp; With the talk of LEDE and OpenWRT merging .... is a new &quot;stable&quot; on the horizon?&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>BTW: running WRT1900AC (mamba)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>IvanRaide</strong> on 9 Jun 2017, 21:47)</p>

					<p><strong>@IvanRaide</strong> A build is only officially considered &quot;<em>Stable</em>&quot; when OpenWrt formally offers that version as the main firmware version [CC]... something that requires whatever version is the &quot;Stable&quot; version to be production ready (i.e. it can be ran in a production environment w/o fear of instability).<br /></p><ul><li><p>This doesn&#039;t mean the development branch [DD] isn&#039;t a stable firmware version to run, but that it isn&#039;t the official stable branch of OpenWrt.&nbsp; DD is also built nightly by buildbot, something CC only does when packages must be updated to comply with a specific kernel version update or a critical patch must be applied.</p></li></ul>									</div>
