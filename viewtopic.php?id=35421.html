					<p>I&#039;m a complete router and linux newb, so bear with me.&nbsp; I recently bought a Netgear WNDR3700v2 and flashed it with OpenWRT.&nbsp; Everything seems to be working really well so far, so I decided to try and add OpenVPN and use a VPN for my home network.&nbsp; The VPN company I decided to go with (HideMyAss) has an auto-installer for OpenVPN on OpenWRT that both installs the OpenVPN software and configures it correctly for their servers.&nbsp; The one flaw in the plan, they only included screenshots with a DD-WRT router.&nbsp; I figured that, in spite of my newbishness, I could probably follow along and figure out what to do in Luci.&nbsp; Wrong.</p><p>I got stumped at one of the first steps.&nbsp; I&#039;m supposed to paste some code in the &quot;Commands&quot; section of the DD-WRT interface, which appears to let you run a command line through the web interface.&nbsp; I searched and searched in OpenWRT, but I didn&#039;t see anything similar.</p><p>So, is it possible to run commands through the web interface?&nbsp; If so, how?</p><p>If it matters, the code begins with: &quot;wget -O /tmp/inst.sh &#039;http://vpn.hidemyass.com/&quot;.</p>									</div>

					<p>There is no direct way to do that - an indirect hack to execute arbritary commands is the following:<br />Navigate to the firewall configuration; open the custom rules tab. Paste your shell commands in the window and hit Save &amp; Apply. Afterwards remove the commands and hit Save.</p>									</div>

					<p>At least i&#039;ve used case for this. Currently I can&#039;t ssh from my office. Tunneling ssh thru https also not possible as we have app firewall which blocks it. I&#039;ve seen certain admin web gui for products like F5 and packetshaper have this. Definitely a lot of people who wants to show off in office but are blocked by firewall will like it.</p>									</div>
