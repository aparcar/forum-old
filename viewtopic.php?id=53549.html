					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to debrick my <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300">TP-Link TL-WDR4300 v1.3</a> from a bad flash. I&#039;m currently trying to do a tftp flash but it doesn&#039;t seem to be taking.</p><p>The steps I took are as follows:</p><p>1. Created static IP address 192.168.0.66/24 and connected the cat cable to Port 1 of the router.<br />2. Set TFTPD32 options to TFTP Server, no security, option negotiation, show progress bar, translate Unix file names, bind TFTP address 10 192.168.0.66, and set the directory to the corresponding location of the required bin wdr4300v1_tp_recovery.bin.<br />3. Press the WPS/Reset for ~7 secs. TFTP starts to upload and seems to complete but nothing happens to the router. <br />4. Using Wireshark, I see that it&#039;s requesting the file and that a the transfer seems to process normally.</p><p>The log from TFTPD:</p><p>Connection received from 192.168.0.86 on port 3975 [23/10 08:17:42.427]<br />Read request for file &lt;wdr4300v1_tp_recovery.bin&gt;. Mode octet [23/10 08:17:42.427]<br />OACK: &lt;timeout=3,&gt; [23/10 08:17:42.437]<br />Using local port 62492 [23/10 08:17:42.437]<br />&lt;wdr4300v1_tp_recovery.bin&gt;: sent 15873 blks, 8126464 bytes in 6 s. 0 blk resent [23/10 08:17:48.245]</p><p>Other things that may be of note:<br />Win 7 machine and I&#039;ve tried both ethernet to router and dumb switch to connect both. Same results.</p><br /><p>I&#039;d appreciate it if anyone can help me in this matter and thanks for your time.</p>									</div>
