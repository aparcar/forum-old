					<p>Hello,</p><br /><p>I am a very experienced Linux kernel and networking engineer (with a little kernel development experience).</p><p>I would like to know if the OpenWRT project can utilize any hardware currently on the market as a high-quality &quot;PPPoE media convertor&quot; ?</p><br /><p>My specification for this task would be:<br /> * DSL modem built in that supports ADSL2+<br /> * DSL modem and driver _MUST_ be able to support full sized 1500byte ethernet packets over G.DMT/ATM<br /> * Ethernet 10/100 built in<br /> * Ethernet chipset and driver _MUST_ be able to support &quot;mini-jumbo&quot; packets (this allows for a working MTU of at least 1508 bytes or more, or ethernet frame sizes of 1526 or more which allows for payload and source/dest MACs, frame type and CRC)<br /> * Ability to modify/have-access-to DSL modem driver to add support to keep statistics bit-rate/SNR/Atten/etc...<br /> * Ability to write some custom kernel code to handle outbound packet queue to DSL modem (I won&#039;t bore the thread with the detail of this, so much to say that I just want to audit/rewrite the &quot;decision point&quot; about next packet selection each time the DSL modem needs feeding with more outbound data, I may also like to signal back towards the PPP-stack/router some flow control / back pressure indicator to allow it to adapt stratagy.&nbsp; i.e. I want zero packet loss outside of the layer3/4 QoS features of the linux kernel, linux supports traffic shaping at higher levels which works best by knowing the effective bandwidth</p><br /><p>The purpose of the extra 8 bytes of allowable ethernet MTU is to provide space for the PPPoE protocol overhead between the media convertor device and the host (which is running the PPP stack/endpoint).&nbsp; Many standard ethernet cards on the market already support mini-jumbo packets, in fact many chipsets do with a minor tweak in the driver.</p><p>It seems that many PPPoE media convertor vendors just don&#039;t get it when it comes to this problem.</p><p>Maybe it would be possible to go one better with OpenWRT and develop and extension to the PPPoE protocol so that a negotiated &quot;Ethernet frame type&quot; could be setup and locked to a session number.&nbsp; From this point on all frames passed between the MACs bearing the negotiated &quot;Ethernet frame type&quot; could be related to that session.</p><br /><p>So which hardware would be a good candidate, does it actually matter ?&nbsp; &nbsp;and what kind of DSL chipset support does OpenWRT/linux provide ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Odin</strong> on 14 Nov 2009, 02:56)</p>
