					<p>I just bought a Netgear WNDR3800 router because I thought it had full OpenWRT support. I downloaded newest trunk version (openwrt-ar71xx-generic-wndr3800-squashfs-factory.img) and flashed it over Netgear&#039;s web interface. First thing I noticed was, luci was not installed with it, though it was mentioned to work from start in the wiki guide. So I installed it, but then I noticed while browsing through luci, that it seems the wifi is not working. I saw a hint in the wiki that I have to install the packages kmod-ath9k and wpad-mini. ath9k seems to be already installed, but there is no package named wpad-mini. When you look under <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/packages/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ â€¦ /packages/</a> there&#039;s none. Where is it? How to setup wifi without it, or where to get it from?</p>									</div>

					<p>You might try my wndr3700/3800 build. Everything works.<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=28392">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=28392</a></p><p>Probably the wapd/hostapd module has been broken during the last trunk snapshot, so the package is missing. Might surface on the next build, as at least one build fix has already been added to the sources.</p>									</div>
