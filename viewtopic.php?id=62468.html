					<p>Wireless is not working on my Netgear DGN3500, I&#039;ve tried several versions of OpenWRT and none seem to have working wireless even though the wiki states it should.</p><p>Its been reverted back to stock now and wireless is functioning fine so it must be an OpenWRT issue right?</p><p>I&#039;ve found this ticket mentioning the Netgear DGN3500 &amp; TPLINK TDW8970:<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/17069">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/17069</a></p><p>which sounds like it could be my issue, apparently the bug was introduced in r40948 so I thought I could try building an older revision but I&#039;m not sure how to do that with git. I only wanted to compile a test build with luci added in if anyone could tell me the correct command?</p><p>I&#039;ve used OpenWRT for a while and would be happy to help solve this issue, im just not very sure how I can help!</p>									</div>
