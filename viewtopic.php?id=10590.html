					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am using a vmware image created using the instructions in the wiki with the relevant patch. It runs fine, but now I wish to add some extra packages; python specifically. When I do that it comes back with an error as indicated above. A web page I found suggest that the ram disk is full. I have no space constraints so I was wondering what i could do to increase the size of this.</p><p>Cheers</p><br /><p>Diarmuid</p>									</div>
