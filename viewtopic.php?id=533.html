Your best bet is to have a look in Window&#039;s log file (check MS&#039;s knowledgebase on how to have it produce an oakley.log file) to see if you can get more information out of that. Else set the debug levels of openswan higher, though that might produce a lot of input.</p><p>This is more a question for the openswan support channels than openwrt&#039;s, btw. As far as I can tell, the openwrt part is working as it should.</p>									</div>
