					<p>Btw, the salient differences is that you&#039;ve still got your wireless on your lan (which is typically configured statically) whereas I&#039;ve got mine on the wan (which is configured via dhcp).

					<p>Duon: You have not missed anything. You MUST include the ifname in case of the wireless wan configuration until all other applications and scripts are fixed.</p><p>mbm: The idea of the dynamic wireless config is clever. But all applications and scripts in OpenWrt expects the ifname in the network config in case of the wan interface. There are many of the scripts that cannot work without setting the ifname in the interface section, for example firewall, miniupnpd and other init scripts requiring the wan interface. The /lib/network/config.sh, scan_interfaces() does not take the dynamic wireless configuration into account.</p>									</div>

					<p>I know this is an old thread and I apologize for posting in it. Iâ€™m posting here rather then starting a new thread because I have questions that relate to ctlâ€™s and duonâ€™s posts. </p><p>Iâ€™m trying to get&nbsp; â€œrouted client modeï¿½&nbsp; working (thatâ€™s what we call this?).&nbsp; My neighbor and I, at our summer cottages, want to share the cost of an internet connection. I have a WRT54GL running Kamikaze 7.09 and his is a Dlink with&nbsp; standard Dlink firmware.</p><p>The Dlink is using the 192.168.2.0 subnet and the Linksys is using 192.168.1.0. The Linksys&nbsp; (via DHCP) gets an IP from the Dlink and places it on br-wan. Br-wan is a bridge between eth0:1 and wl0.&nbsp; The firewall is up and masquarding is enabled. The routing table shows the default route via the 192.168.2.1 gateway.</p><br /><p>Destination&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gateway&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Genmask&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Flags Metric Ref&nbsp; &nbsp; Use Iface<br />192.168.2.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;255.255.255.0&nbsp; &nbsp;U&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 br-wan<br />192.168.1.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;255.255.255.0&nbsp; &nbsp;U&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 br-lan<br />default&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;192.168.2.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.0.0.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;UG&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 br-wan</p><br /><p>On the Linksys router (OpenWRT)&nbsp; I can get to any machine and the world. All is good. The issue is with any wired machines connected to the Linksys switch. They can ping the routerâ€™s 192.168.2.x interface but thatâ€™s where it stops. They canâ€™t reach 192.168.2.1 or the internet. And yes, their default routes are set to the Linksys router (192.168.1.124). </p><p>I guess the obvious question is, â€œwhy donâ€™t it work?ï¿½&nbsp; but I have a couple of others. Why is clt &amp; duon changing the switch setting for vlan0? I tried it and it didnâ€™t fix the problem but I donâ€™t understand, itâ€™s necessity. Why is clt changing the HW addresses on the interfaces?&nbsp; Again, I tried this but it did not fix the problem. Do I need certain numbers?</p><p>What am I missing? To me, it seems like the Linksys is not routing the packets to the 192.168.2.1 gateway?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nuke12</strong> on 11 May 2008, 18:32)</p>

					<p>Well, I didnâ€™t receive any help but I did get it working. Un-said in my first post, I wanted to do this in a script. I wanted to keep my regular configs when the router was at home and script the â€œrouted client modeï¿½&nbsp; when at the cottage. My failing was not dropping the firewall and restarting it. </p><p>I think this method is simpler then what ctl or duon is using if your trying to setup â€œrouted client modeï¿½&nbsp; within a script. The reason, no switch changes are necessary, the lan side stays static and if connected via ssh, you can run the script without being disconnected or the necessity of rebooting.</p><p>So, here goes;</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

if test $# -eq 0
then echo &quot;&quot;
     echo &quot;Select Wireless Network to Join&quot;
     echo &quot;Option: Enter Network ESSID&quot;
     echo &quot;&quot;
     exit
fi

/etc/init.d/firewall stop
ifdown wan
wifi down
uci set wireless.cfg2.ssid=$1
uci set wireless.cfg2.mode=sta
uci set wireless.cfg2.encryption=none
uci set wireless.cfg2.network=wan
uci set network.wan.proto=dhcp
uci set network.wan.type=bridge
ifup wan
wifi up
/etc/init.d/firewall start</code></pre></div><p>This sets up a bridge (br-wan) between eth0.1 &amp; wl0 and sets the IP on the bridge. The script also assumes you have the wireless running as an access point and your connecting to an open access point. You will need more wireless settings if your connecting to an encrypted network. Probably some of these;</p><p>option encryption&nbsp; wep, psk, psk2, wpa, wpa2<br />option key encryption key<br />option key1 key 1<br />option key2 key 2<br />option key3 key 3<br />option key4 key 4</p><p>The basic script, gives the same rip-off features to join a network, as Blue Box. </p><p>I hope this helps others.</p><p>P.S. - please note, I don&#039;t &quot;uci commit&quot; anywhere in the script. That way the changes only exist between reboots and only when the script is run.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nuke12</strong> on 13 May 2008, 00:37)</p>
