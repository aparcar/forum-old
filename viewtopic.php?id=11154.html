					<p>There is no 802.11n standard, all the equipment currently on the market is sold as &quot;pre-n&quot; or &quot;draft-n&quot;. There is no guarantee that this will be compatible with other 11n equipment, or that it will adhere to the final 802.11n specification. Calling this equipment beta quality is an overstatement, the equipment tends to be &quot;alpha&quot; at best -- it will cost you more than competing 11g equipment and won&#039;t perform any better.</p>									</div>
