					<p>I have finally gotten fiber installed in both our homes and I would like to set up a VPN between them.</p><p>One location has the network 192.168.0, the other 192.168.1, so no collisions. I assume there is nothing inherent with the 192.168 network ranges that makes them non routable.</p><p>One location has a TP-Link Archer C7, the other a Linksys WRT3200ACM, both run LEDE 17.01.2.</p><p>At least one of the locations have a fixed external IP v4 address, the other may be dynamic, but will eventually become fixed as well.</p><p>Anyone have some simple tutorial/howto on how to achieve this?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Thomas</p>									</div>

					<p>This is a straightforward situation.&nbsp; Make the house with the static IP the server so your client (the router in the other house) can find it easily.&nbsp; You don&#039;t need a static IP on the client end since the whole point of the VPN is to be able to link from anywhere.</p><p><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.openvpn">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.openvpn</a></p><p>When you get to the part of generating certificates, run it on something with a big CPU.&nbsp; The little MIPS in the Archer C7 will take more than an hour to do it.</p><p>It is possible to set all of this up for testing in one house, then move the router to the remote location.&nbsp; You would plug the WAN ports of both routers into a third router (which may or may not be connected to the Internet) to simulate being connected to each other via the WAN.&nbsp; The third router would have a network such as 192.168.10.x&nbsp; Then you point the client at the server in the 192.168.10 range.&nbsp; All you need to do is change the IP when you switch to using the real Internet.</p><p>Set up both routers with ssh ports open and public/private key authentication so you can administer one from the other house if necessary.</p><p>And yes, when it is finally working, you would be able to use the networks like they both exist on the same LAN.&nbsp; For example you have a printer in the remote house at 192.168.1.10.&nbsp; You would set the printer driver address to that on the PCs in the local house that has 192.168.0.x.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 11 Aug 2017, 00:40)</p>
