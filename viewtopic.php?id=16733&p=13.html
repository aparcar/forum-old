					<p>Hi all, </p><p>Sorry for kicking this topic, but does the posts above mean that you can use VLAN functionality on the WRT610n v2 or am I missing some information? </p><p>They got it working on <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=484077#484077">DD-WRT</a> so I assume it could work on openWRT as well. Only thing to keep in mind is that LUCI may be configuring the wrong CPU port (5 instead of 8) which could make your device inaccessible. Therefore, use only the command line. </p><p>Am I right?</p>									</div>

					<p>That is not a WRT610N specific problem, you just fell into the trap of installing a trunk snapshot one day - and then trying to install further kernel modules several days later (which were built against a different/ newer trunk snapshot).</p><p>Trunk snapshots are rebuilt roughly daily, but kernel modules (and their corresponding module packages) need to match exactly to the kernel they&#039;ve been built against. In practice this means you can only install (module-)packages built in the same build run as the firmware you installed, so basically from the same day as the trunk snapshot you downloaded and flashed. This means you either need to install all potentially needed packages right away after flashing your trunk snapshot or mirror all packages corresponding to the firmware you&#039;re going to flash (and then feed those to opkg instead of the fresh ones on download.openwrt.org).</p><p>Unless you have special reasons to use a trunk snapshot, it&#039;s probably easier for you to just flash an official release firmware - whose /etc/opkg.conf points to a (mostly-) frozen package tree corresponding to the release firmware you installed, so you can &#039;always&#039; install matching packages later on.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>slh</strong> on 20 Jan 2015, 00:21)</p>

					<p>Ok - I think that clears things up, and I understand the problem.&nbsp; I&#039;m a little foggy on the solution though.&nbsp; I think the best thing for me to do is reflash my router with an official release.&nbsp; However, I was under the impression that the WRT610n was not officially supported, so it was risky to install an official release on it (as in the official release had not been tested and the snapshot was a custom OpenWRT version built for the WRT610n)?&nbsp; Is that not the case?&nbsp; </p><p>So if I need an official release, what is the best release for me to download / what bin file do I download?&nbsp; And then after I have downloaded and installed this, in theory I should be able to install packages whenever I want and not just the same day I flash it?</p><p>Thanks for putting up with my beginner questions!&nbsp; You&#039;re helping me understand this a lot.</p><p>-Nate</p>									</div>

					<p>I must say I&#039;m pretty impressed with OpenWrt.&nbsp; My WRT610N has been configured with 4 VLANs: management, main LAN, renter LAN, and an IoT LAN.
