					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;m having a heck of a time here.&nbsp; I&#039;m confused with how to setup iptables.&nbsp; I need to ftp files to my web host.&nbsp; I just got an account yesterday.&nbsp; I can connect, but I&#039;m sure the firewall is preventing a remote directory listing.</p><p>I understand this:</p><p>There are configurations in /etc/config/firewall<br />There is an /etc/firewall.user file that is empty</p><p>I don&#039;t understand:</p><p>How to allow ftp so I can send files to the remote directory.&nbsp; I don&#039;t get a remote listing but can connect, so I assume it&#039;s not allowed back in to my lan.</p><p>I can probably do this with iptables on other systems using traditional iptables scripts, but don&#039;t know how to work with openwrt&#039;s setup.</p><p>Any help would be much, much appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>									</div>
