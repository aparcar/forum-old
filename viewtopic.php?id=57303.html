					<p>yes i know that , but it does not work .<br />First if you want to setup a different lan ip address with DHCP activated is not possible , only static .<br />Configuring the wan port with static ip and then configuring lan with dhcp it will not work .<br />Anyone with doubts should test it to see .</p>									</div>

					<p>Stock firmware in its default configuration works exactly the same as OpenWRT&#039;s default configuration:<br />The LAN has a static address 192.168.1.1 and runs a DHCP server to give clients addresses in the 192.168.1.x range.<br />The WAN is a DHCP client to acquire its address from the modem and /or ISP.&nbsp; This can be changed if necessary when the ISP does not run DHCP but instead expects you to configure a static address.</p><p>Checking the box near the bottom of the lan network configuration page turns OFF the DHCP server.&nbsp; This then requires that either you have another DHCP server, or that every user on the LAN is configured with static addresses.&nbsp; In a typical simple home network where you have a single router and want it to be the DHCP server on the LAN--&nbsp; leave the box UNchecked.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 13 May 2015, 15:39)</p>
