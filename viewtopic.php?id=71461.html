					<p>I have a TPLink WR810N v1 that I currently have a trunk version of CC (I think). And so far almost everything seams to be working except when I try to add new packages. I get errors complaining about dependencies etc.. mainly kernel version etc.. After reading other posts via google it appears as though I should not use a trunk version of CC. If this is the case can someone point me in the right direction on how to go from trunk to stable or whatever I should use? I don&#039;t mind having to reload everything I just don&#039;t want to brick this little guy as I don&#039;t have a serial interface to it.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>~SOL</p>									</div>

					<p>According to the OpenWrt page for this device (<a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr810n">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr810n</a>), it is only supported on the &quot;trunk&quot; version, I am afraid that there is no &quot;stable&quot; release for that device. However, there is a stable version of LEDE (for all practical purposes, you can consider LEDE as the next version of OpenWrt) at <a href="https://lede-project.org/toh/hwdata/tp-link/tp-link_tl-wr810n_1.0_us.">https://lede-project.org/toh/hwdata/tp- … 0n_1.0_us.</a></p><p>To perform the upgrade, just use the file at <a href="https://downloads.lede-project.org/releases/17.01.2/targets/ar71xx/generic/lede-17.01.2-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr810n-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin">https://downloads.lede-project.org/rele … pgrade.bin</a> on the &quot;upgrade&quot; page at LuCI.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the info. That explains how I ended up with the trunk build as vs the other builds. Iv herd of and ready very little about LEDE. Looks basically like the same thing, maybe a fork of openwrt or something. One article I was reading made it sound like the two may eventually merge or something. Interesting none the less.</p><p>Can I just go flash the LEDE firmware ontop of OpenWRT or is there something special I need to do first etc?</p><p>Thanks again for the info and help.</p><p>Update : I did a quick google search for &quot;flash lede over openwrt&quot; and the first hit was &quot;Standard Flashing Instructions&quot;.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>If your device is already running LEDE (or OpenWrt)</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; download the file for a “sysupgrade installation” from Device Page or Device Techdata<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; check that this file is not corrupted by following the Downloading and verifying LEDE firmware image paragraph<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; if your device has the LuCI web interface, proceed with the Installing LEDE sysupgrade instructions for installation.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; If your device does not have a web interface or you have specific advanced configurations you want to preserve or update after the upgrade, follow the instructions on Installing LEDE from Command Line or ask on the Installing and Using LEDE category of the forum.</p></blockquote></div><p>~SOL</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>SomeoneOnLine</strong> on 12 Jul 2017, 04:44)</p>

					<p>As I said before, for all practical purposes you can consider that OpenWrt was renamed to LEDE on version 17.02; other than the expected evolutions and updates, there are no other significant changes. If you are comfortable with OpenWrt, you will be comfortable with LEDE. As for the upgrade process, moving from OpenWrt to LEDE is exactly the same as upgrading OpenWrt (or LEDE) to a newer OpenWrt (or LEDE).</p>									</div>
