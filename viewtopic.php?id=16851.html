					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am giving up. Can&#039;t be that hard? Yes, it can! I was trying to get OpenWrt running on my Netgear WGT634U today. The flashing procedure worked flawlessly. I could flash Kamikaze using the webinterface. Changed the password and disabled telnet and enabled SSH. Great.</p><p>The next thing I did was activating the WLAN-signal. Edited the /etc/config/wireless and the /etc/config/network. Used the samples from this page:</p><p><a href="http://openwrt.loswillios.de">http://openwrt.loswillios.de</a>/</p><p>I rebooted and the WLAN-signal was active, but: not encrypted. I read on and on and figured out that wpa_supplicant has to be installed. But that seems not available in the packages-file. What is going on here?</p><p>How do I setup this one? And why is there no working tutorial for such a common task?</p><br /><p>Greetings.</p>									</div>

It&#039;s the best if you build (I recommend latest trunk) by yourself and use your own package repository created during the build proccess.

					<p>Yeah, many thanks for giving clear advice. But actually I&#039;m still stuck compiling the firmware. First of all I had to checkout the current version and then I did a</p><p>make menuconfig</p><p>I selected</p><p>Target Profile (Netgear WGT634U)<br />Target System (Broadcom BCM947xx/953xx [2.6])</p><p>saved and started compiling with</p><p>make world V=99</p><p>That results in the following error:</p><p>In file included from ./include/sys/types.h:31,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;from ./include/stdlib.h:306,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;from ./ldso/include/ldso.h:28,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;from ldso/ldso/ldso.c:33:<br />./include/bits/types.h:206:32: error: bits/pthreadtypes.h: No such file or directory<br />make[4]: *** [ldso/ldso/ldso.oS] Error 1</p><p>I guess there is still some package missing on my buils-system.
