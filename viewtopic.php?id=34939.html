					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;m working in my final degree proyect. </p><p>My target to reach is to create a transparent WOL. If I want to apply for a service from PC to PC2, no matter the stade of the PC2 (on,off). <br />If it&#039;s off, (there will be a table or whatever with that stade), the router will send an automatic magyc packet in order to wake it up, and then, I&#039;ll be able to use that service.</p><p>The key is not to have the necesity to use the WOL first because the router will do it itself.</p><p>Is there anything similar? it&#039;s already implement in any package?</p><p>If not, I&#039;m afraid I&#039;ll need to download the repository and do it on my own. </p><p> Any ideas or tips will be usefull. Thank you very much because I&#039;m quite lost.</p>									</div>
