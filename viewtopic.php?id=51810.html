					<p>I designed a this stand alone programmer with SD card for storage and four places for flash chips (2xSO8 + 2xSO16 packages) with serial console for writing commands, Hoping that this will help debricking routers for those who don&#039;t have usb programmers (Like me) and want to build their own ones (and have fun , of course)<br />The circuit is controlled by an ATMEGA168 with the following features:</p><p><span style="color: #0000FF"><strong><br />*-fast read/write (writing 4MB flash in 30 sec).</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #0000FF"><strong>*-simple command line for reading and writing files from/to flash (It uses the UART port so you must use your usb2serial cable @115200 baud or if you don&#039;t have one you have to store the commands you want to execute in a file &quot;script1.txt&quot; and then press the button).</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #0000FF"><strong>*-Automatically detect flash size and brand , i added most commonly known chips so if your chip is not recognized it&#039;ll tell you the ID of the chip and you have to add this ID in file SpiFlash.c in function getFlashInfo(ID) and recompile.</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #0000FF"><strong>*-two push-buttons for executing commands stored in files in the SD card , so if you press SW1 the command in file script1 will be executed and pressing SW2 will execute the contents of file script2.txt that stored in SD&nbsp; (if you don&#039;t want to connect the board to PC). </strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #0000FF"><strong>*-External Connector for Programming chips out of board ( In System Programmer ?) .</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #0000FF"><strong>*-Two status LEDs , One for read and one for write. </strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #0000FF"><strong>*-Open source software and hardware so you can modify it to meet your needs.<br /></strong></span></p><br /><h5>commands:</h5><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1- cp dest source<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; copies source to destination (can be chipx or file name)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; ex1:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; cp chip3 flash.bin<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; writes file flash.bin to the chip placed in chip4 location (you must erase first i.e type: &quot;erase chip4&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; ex2:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; cp read_ch1.bin&nbsp; chip1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; reads the contents of chip1 to a file &quot;read_ch1.bin&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 2- erase dest blk_num<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; erases the 64k block/entire chip if not specified <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; ex1:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; erase chip1 0 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; erase first 64k(bootloader?)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; ex2:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; erase chip1 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; will erase the entire chip(fill it with FF&#039;s)</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 3- id<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; read the chip id<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; ex:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; id chip2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /></p><h5>Usage:</h5><p>*Put the file you want to write to the chip in a <span style="color: #FF0000">FAT16</span> formatted SD Card<br />*Power up the board 3.3v (5V works fine, don&#039;t worry) and connect the USB to Serial converter to your board and insert the SD Card<br />*use the Following commands:<br />example : backup the chip (in the chip3 location)contents and save it to backup.bin and then replace the bootloader (assume it is the first 128kb) with the file boot.bin:<br />answer:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1- backup flash (chip3)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cp backup.bin chip3</code></pre></div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 2- erase first and second 64k blocks<br />&nbsp;

					<p>I also did something like a &quot;hd44780&quot; assembly translator with a ultra-basic line PIC18.<br />It was for the Nokia 7110 LCD (pretty similar to any Nokia monochrome LCD)<br />Basically it had few commands like XY positioning, clear , return, new line, and print the characters on the screen.<br />So if I had to put a LCD to anuy project, I never had to worry about any controller and its memory, I just had to implement the communication (spi based) and send simple messages similar to this: (x0,y30,&quot;Hello&quot;). The controller had the bitfont characters itself.<br />I&#039;ll check how much code it occupied.</p><p>EDIT: It used 700 words, this chip use 16 bit word ( instruction+data). That means around 1400bytes.<br />Are you using non-optimiced C compiler? Try optimizing compiling for code size</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dabyd64</strong> on 31 Jul 2014, 16:33)</p>

					<p>Is there BOM available. On schematics or PCB layout, there is no all component types etc available?</p>									</div>
