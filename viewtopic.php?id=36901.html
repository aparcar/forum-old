					<p>Thanks to all these nice people who provided the files. Initial findings suggest:</p><p>WZR-HP-G300NH2 A0 A1 comes with u-boot 1.03, which is unlocked<br/>WZR-HP-G300NH2 A1 A0 comes with u-boot 1.08, which has disabled serial console<br/>WZR-HP-G302H (Japanese variant) A1 A0 also comes with u-boot 1.08, which has disabled serial console</p><p>Also, it seems that WZR-HP-G300NH2 A1 A0 and WZR-HP-G302H A1 A0 are identical hardware, as both are shipped with dual 16MiB SIP flash ROM, with erase bock size of 64k.</p>									</div>
