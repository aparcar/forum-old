					<p>I flashed 10.03.1-rc5 to a Linksys WET54Gv4 (previously running an OEM firmware) last week, then went about configuring it to replace an (even) older Linksys router also running OEM firmware.&nbsp; All seemed to go alright, old router was reconfigured to use by someone else at a different site.&nbsp; The router config is pretty straightforward - no additional modules have been installed, it&#039;s got a couple of SSIDs (one to provide seamless path for old wireless clients, the other using better security), tweaked LAN IP range, and that&#039;s about it.</p><p>I went to transfer some files from that subnet to a system on my primary network (WAN side of the OpenWRT router, but still within my own network) - something I did all the time with the prior stock-firmware router.&nbsp; The DNS resolution failed.&nbsp; I can run &#039;host -t A hostname.domain.tld&#039; from the client machine, and it&#039;ll report that the host doesn&#039;t exist.&nbsp; The router gets its WAN config via DHCP, and I can resolve other hosts within the same zone (i.e. queries sent to the VERY SAME DNS SERVER for the same domain) just fine.&nbsp; The zone is served up by a DNS host on my network (not external to the net).&nbsp; Other hosts on the primary network have no issues resolving the host in question.&nbsp; If I specify the IP address of the host, I can connect to it from within the subnet served by the OpenWRT router (though of course, connection to the host itself has nothing to do with DNS resolution provided by a different host).</p><p>I ssh&#039;d to the OpenWRT router, and the /etc/resolv.conf file has my DNS server IPs in it.&nbsp; The router hands it&#039;s own address out as the DNS server to its clients.&nbsp; If I use the advanced config in the LAN Interface section, I can specify my DNS servers using the 6,ip,ip notation in the additional DHCP options field.&nbsp; This seems to resolve the failure to resolve, but I&#039;d like to know why the original config failed to resolve one host but not others.&nbsp; Also, if there might be an option for &quot;pass along the hosts for the upstream DNS&quot; for DHCP - that is, inherit the WAN client info.&nbsp; I shouldn&#039;t have to manually configure the DNS hosts in the router - after all, the ROUTER is getting the info in its own DHCP client lease...</p>									</div>

					<p>Maybe your primary network uses a tld that is considered local by dnsmasq, and I believe its was the DNS rebind protection which made stuff fail for you (it will discard any upstream responses containing RFC1918 addresses) - a short look into the syslog should tell whether it is the case.</p>									</div>

					<p>primary network uses .org tld.&nbsp; It&#039;s a legitimate zone, and the DNS servers themselves are actually authoritative, not merely cacheing.</p><p>Other hosts in the zone, say &quot;www&quot; and &quot;osprey&quot; resolved fine, but &quot;phoenix&quot; doesn&#039;t.&nbsp; Phoenix has an A record, it isn&#039;t say a CNAME (which shouldn&#039;t be an issue, but the point is, it&#039;s a straight-up address record).&nbsp; I hadn&#039;t thought of the RFC1918 - private IP space issue.&nbsp; Of course, the the host is in private IP.&nbsp; I&#039;ll add my local domains to the RFC1918 exclusion...</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
