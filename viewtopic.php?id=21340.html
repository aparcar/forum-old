					<p>I am getting garbled text on my serial console, with only partially readable blocks of text.&nbsp; I am wondering if it&#039;s because i might have yanked the cable out while it was connected damaging the serial port or some other reason.&nbsp; Originally, I had been able to use this USB tty connector but now it doesn&#039;t seem to work properly without getting intermittent garbage text.&nbsp; </p><p>I thought since i&#039;ve been trying to get this a program I&#039;ve been working on to send text over the serial port i&#039;ve been trying different set ups and I had thought that maybe it was the settings that I had wrong, so I decided to go with a clean install of whiterussian and i still can&#039;t read the serial console on /dev/tty/0 without getting internmittent garbled text. </p><p>I&#039;ve also tried different port speeds and flow control but it doesn&#039;t seem to work.&nbsp; As i understand it, it should work with the following settings:<br />speed - 115200<br />data bits - 8<br />stop bits - 1<br />parity - none<br />flow control - none</p><p>The router i am using is a wrt54gl v1.1</p><p>I&#039;ve also tested out the usb tty chip to check and see if maybe there was problems there, but it I am able to use it without any problems to upload programs to my arduino.</p>									</div>
