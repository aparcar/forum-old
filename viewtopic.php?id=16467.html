					<p>Hello, developers</p><p>Is it possible to add support for a new board? It&#039;s not actually router but network fast frame rate camera based on ADM5120 SoC. It&#039;s a great that Kamikaze supports this SoC (or begins doing this). Cameras are developed in Ioffe Insitute. We used Infineon EASY-5120 Reference Board for looking &quot;what ADM5120 is&quot;, but cameras has some differences: one Lan interface, USB 2.0 (via special chip), 32MiB SDRAM, 4MiB Flash and so on. So it reqiures special profile. For example when I boot openwrt-adm5120-easy-5120-rt-jffs2.img:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>adm5120-hcd adm5120-hcd: ADM5120 built-in USB 1.1 Host Controller
adm5120-hcd adm5120-hcd: new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 1
adm5120-hcd adm5120-hcd: irq 11, io mem 0x11200000
adm5120-hcd: unable to setup operational mode!
admhc-hcd: unable to run ADM5120
adm5120-hcd adm5120-hcd: dma_pool_destroy admhc_td, a1f0f000 busy
adm5120-hcd adm5120-hcd: startup error -1
adm5120-hcd adm5120-hcd: USB bus 1 deregistered
adm5120-hcd: probe of adm5120-hcd failed with error -1</code></pre></div><p>It&#039;s just example. So it need it&#039;s own board-profile (one Lan interface, USB 2.0, 32MiB SDRAM, ...). How add it to trunc? And what I must do?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Stanislav</strong> on 30 Jul 2008, 16:37)</p>
