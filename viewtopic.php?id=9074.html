					<p>Good evening,</p><p>I successfullly build my own image containing the package I need and the files I want to create or replace.<br />everything works fine unti i tried to replace this file :</p><p>files/usr/lib/webif/webif.sh</p><p>the webif.sh i&#039;m trying to put contains only little changes (as a try) and works fine if I copy it directly to the rooter&#039;s</p><p>but when building the image the browser gives me the following error :</p><p>/usr/lib/webif/webif.sh: 17: <br />: not found<br />.: 23: Can&#039;t open /usr/lib/webif/functions.sh</p><br /><p>so I tried to do the same without changing webif.sh (but still put it in files/usr/lib/webif/webif.sh before compiling.)<br />and i still have the same error</p><p>putting it in another folder and then copying it at startup does the same error.</p><p>copying any webif.sh from windows usin winscp makes it work.</p><p>I also tried different right on file access but did not arrange anything.</p><p>If anyone can tell me what&#039;s wrong ?</p><br /><p>thanks.</p>									</div>
