					<p>RC6 has been released; while this is mostly a bugfix release, it does represent the end of the whiterussian era.</p><p>whiterussian -&gt; kamikaze -&gt; buildroot-ng -&gt; kamikaze</p><p>Whiterussian represents the original stable branch; around RC4 development shifted from keeping whiterussian up to date to building kamikaze into a release, and the whiterussian releases suffered. RC5 was released, but the original goals for whiterussian hadn&#039;t been met, so more releases of whiterussian were planned but got preempted by the rewrite kamikaze underwent with the &quot;buildroot-ng&quot; branch. Buildroot-ng revolutionized the build system used to compile kamikaze.</p><p>By now, the kamikaze and buildroot-ng branches were so far ahead of whiterussian that nobody really wanted another whiterussian release (broken build system with many obsolete packages), and there was talk of backporting kamikaze/buildroot-ng into whiterussian. Ultimately it was determined that this would take more effort than writing buildoor-ng in the first place. In other words, cut the losses, release one last whiterussian and switch over to kamikaze/buildroot-ng. We didn&#039;t want to wait so long that kamikaze would be basically cut and pasted into another group&#039;s firmware and released by someone else (long story).</p><p>Some RC6 changes worth noting:<br/>- mini_fo<br/>- timing fixes<br/>- new diag driver for leds/buttons</p>									</div>
