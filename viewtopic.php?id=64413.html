					<p>Most likely you&#039;ve lost connection because the lan IP of the router is not in the range your network has.<br />Manually setup IP on your computer to be in the IP range of that router and try to ping it. If this works,&nbsp; ssh into the router and change its ip to a static one that is in the normal range your network operates on. Now you should be able to access it whenever you want.</p>									</div>

Don&#039;t expect miracles if http/ssh does not work don&#039;t think anything except physically connecting to it will gain you an access. And that might not work either if the firewall on the router is misconfigured. Best to reset it to defaults (if the router has such option/boot to safe mode) and start from the begining.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dziny</strong> on 24 Apr 2016, 23:01)</p>
