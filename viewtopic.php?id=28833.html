					<p>I currently have a Dlink DIR-615-C1 with DD-WRT installed, and it works fine as such.</p><p>This is the Atheros based chipset.</p><p> I have been reading about AAP and AutoAP, and would like to try this out, however, I am not sure what firmware to use. Do I need Kamikaze/Piranha/openwrt-ar71xx-dir-615-c1-squashfs-factory.bin/whatever? I have been reading a lot of info on here and other sites, but a lot of it is old, and I&#039;m not sure what firmware supports what. Also, are there instructions on updating from DD-WRT to OPENWRT or do I need to restore back to Dlink Firmware?</p><p> The only use for this would be to put in my car and grab a wireless connection wherever I am and have it connected to my laptop either through ethernet, or as a wireless repeater. I travel a lot and having it auto search for an open hotspot would be an incredible help.</p><p>Thanks<br />Jeff</p>									</div>

					<p>Are you referring to <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/AutoAP">AutoAP - DD-WRT Wiki</a>? Have you tried it?</p><p>If you do travel a lot, you might consider Buffalo WHR-HP-GN which has more transmit power than others, or Fonera which is very compact.</p>									</div>
