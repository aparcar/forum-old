					<p>I have problems installing any kernel module as it seems, they all have a dependency to a kernel with same version but different version ending, see below:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/# opkg install kmod-usb-serial coreutils-stty
Installing kmod-usb-serial (3.3.8-1) to root...
Downloading http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09/ar71xx/generic/packages/kmod-usb-serial_3.3.8-1_ar71xx.ipk.
Package coreutils-stty (8.16-1) installed in root is up to date.
Collected errors:
 * satisfy_dependencies_for: Cannot satisfy the following dependencies for kmod-usb-serial:
 *      kernel (= 3.3.8-1-d6597ebf6203328d3519ea3c3371a493) * 
 * opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package kmod-usb-serial.</code></pre></div><p>So, I&#039;m having:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/# opkg list-installed| grep kernel
kernel - 3.3.8-1-cf032f02071b358867cb4d8f778785c2</code></pre></div><p>I was under the impression that I will be able to install all packages for my openwrt version (12.09) but apparently not, can someone shed light on this.</p><p>Why do I have a slightly different kernel version?<br />What is the normal way out of this situation?</p><p>I need to install the prolific drivers so I can connect to another device UART console.</p><br /><br /><p>Thanks for the help...</p>									</div>

					<p>I had the same problem with a custom build kernel. You can install the kernel usb with the option &quot;--force-depends&quot;. Just type &quot;opkg&quot; to see all available options and their explanations. For course that doesn&#039;t gaurantee that the module will actually work. But if kmod-usb-serial fails to load that should not cause any major problems. But anyway, use force-depens at your own risk.</p>									</div>

					<p>Looks like you might not be using the official release? The checksum of its kernel is d6597ebf6203328d3519ea3c3371a493.
