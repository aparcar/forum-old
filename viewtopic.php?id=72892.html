					<p>By checking the logs for the PPPoE handshake.</p><p>In some cases it might already help a lot by keeping both modem and router powered off for something like 15 minutes (up to two hours), before trying again (waiting for the ISPs old PPPoE session and DHCP reservation to time out).</p>									</div>

					<p>Gosh, way back i did a Verizon Westell dal modem router combo as just a pass through to the Internet and used a&nbsp; modded RT311 flashed with Zxyl firmware as my wired router for the entertainment and printing firewall. </p><p>Don&#039;t know much about your hardware, but one way to bypass on the dal modem, is to turn off security, thus all ports are open. Keep the routed bridge, as it is your link to the Internet from DSL.&nbsp; Set the modem lan ip as 192.168.100.37. Some arbitrary range to keep you from mixing on the same subnet. </p><p>Use any wired port as the up link to your Linksys router. The linksys will be given a DHCP address, and can be setup to static by making it a single ip in the range, even though DHCP is still active. It should push DNS through dhcp to your linksys router.</p><p>Once that is setup, you can then use the administration page to setup your linksys lan ip to 192.168.10.101. This keeps Malware from attacking your router directly by hammering your routers internal IP. Most routers are 192.168.1.1. </p><p>Just have to remember your router&#039;s new ip to administer it, and your DHCP range will be on the 192.168.10.XXX range.<br />If you still have issues, it must be a config issue with the linksys, on port forwarding or blocking.</p>									</div>

					<p>Done. Do I need to have the L sign in using pppoe or keep the CL as the signer? Also, the L config file has a line that says: option type &#039;bridge&#039;</p><p>Do I need to change that since the CL is the bridge, not the L?</p><p>Also, does the L have DHCP and NAT turned on or off by default?</p><p>chadrick</p>									</div>

					<p>Leave the DSL modem in place as the sign in.&nbsp; As it has the ADSlLmodem built in. I am not sure about your linksys having the DSL modem functionality&nbsp; built in.</p><p>The linksys must have dhcp and nat (security functionality) if you do not have your devices setup with static adresses. Much simpler to have DHCP set for changes later on or portability.</p><p>As long a you follow my rules for setup, there is no interference between dhcp devices. Basically your adsl modem will be your provider connex, with&nbsp; a private ip being seen in the house. If using a dynamic dns site for your home, grab the public ip from your adsl modem, just remember it is not on your ip range any more.</p><p>As for routed bridge, yes... leave the linksys as routed bridge.</p><p>I think most of your original setup had been properly set, just minor changes to make things proper for connectivity.</p><p>The only question is how the zines is set for security. Some routers have various features disabled, like ftp and telnet for basic security protection as default. </p><p>Here may be a basic menu for quick settings to allow various open ports to be allowed in setup configuration.&nbsp; If not, you would have to open ports and port forward if needed fo your needs.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Notsofast</strong> on 1 Jan 2018, 12:50)</p>

					<p>I have been in your situation before.&nbsp; If your modem combo will allow you have to but it in bridge mode.&nbsp; Then take your router equipped with a dedicated wan port and connect it there.&nbsp; Once that is done you should be able to start the fun stuff.&nbsp; I host mail, web, and other services on mine. </p><p>My router has been virtual, physical and a combo of both.&nbsp; I think pfsense has been my favorite.&nbsp; I am always looking at new products.</p>									</div>
