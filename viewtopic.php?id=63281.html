					<p>What kernel, uboot and firmware can be used on a qca9531-based router? I don&#039;t want to build it myself, so I need prebuilt images.</p><p>As I&#039;m new to OpenWRT, some questions:</p><p>1) does the uboot-env automatically end up directly after the uboot image in flash and take up 64kb? Otherwise how is this decided?</p><p>2) should the bootcmd always point to the kernel flash address?</p><p>3) will the uboot binary be very device specific, i.e it will be totally hardcoded for the size of and type of memory used on the board etc?</p><p>4) How is the boot args in the uboot-env decided, do I need to change it when updating the firmware, ex mtd partitions and rootfs type etc. If I need to care about it, where is all this documented?</p><p>5) I cant seem to get the fw_config to work (bad crc etc) can someone explain?</p><p>Thanks <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

I don&#039;t want to build it myself, so I need prebuilt images.</p></blockquote></div><p>OpenWrt does not support &quot;unknown&quot; hardware. Look at wikidevi ( <a href="https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Qualcomm_Atheros">https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Qualcomm_Atheros</a> ) or OpenWrt wiki toh for routers with that SoC and check compatibility.</p><p>- uboot:<br />Upstream U-boot has no support for QCA hardware. ( <a href="http://lists.denx.de/pipermail/u-boot/2016-February/244298.html">http://lists.denx.de/pipermail/u-boot/2 â€¦ 44298.html</a> ).<br />All OpenWrt router keep very old vendor u-boot (1.1.4 iirc) - this forum has a thread with a modified u-boot but that version does not seem to support your specific SoC (see <a href="https://github.com/pepe2k/u-boot_mod">https://github.com/pepe2k/u-boot_mod</a> )</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>1) does the uboot-env automatically end up directly after the uboot image in flash and take up 64kb? Otherwise how is this decided?</p></blockquote></div><p>- This can prevent accidental overwriting - starting to write beginning at a safe offset.<br />- see u-boot source code (CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET or some constant depending how QCA modified code)</p><p>2: in OpenWrt there often is an lzma loader. since overwriting factory bootloaders can be dangerous (unknown memory config, side effects...) - sometimes its better to chain bootload a newer u-boot bootloader version that has additional features to boot newer kernels (afaik this is not done on QCA but is done on some projects not OpenWrt related and some ARM targets use <br />2 bootloaders when booting)</p><p>3: yes and no - see modifications done by pepe2k to support several QCA chips within one codebase; while many vendors use the same SoC individual setup/GPIO usage can differ so hw init and uboot has to behave differently too</p><p>4) Boot args are environment variables stored in u-boot env partition. OpenWrt however does not use/touch these - so going back to original firmware should work more easily for end users.<br />OpenWrt patches kernel to change cmdline - see OpenWrt specific Kernel patches like &quot;508-MIPS-ath79-prom-image-command-line-hack.patch&quot; in target/linux/ar71xx/patches-&lt;kernel-version&gt;<br />So its documented in code or in image creation file (target/linux/ar71xx/image/Makefile)</p><p>5) dunno what you mean - since there is no &quot;common&quot; bootloader and most OpenWrt stuff is not included in u-boot or Linux (because changing kernel cmdline via patch is &quot;hackish&quot; and cannot be included) every router vendor can modify the code with their own stuff - so CRC calculation might be more elaborate etc.<br />IIRC u-boot explicitly states in docs that u-boot env is CRC protected (sometimes?always? dunno) and using &quot;saveenv&quot; should recalculate the right value and prevent error messages/failed boots.</p>									</div>
