					<p>Oops, didn&#039;t read the whole article<br />hehe<br />Maybe I&#039;ll just put linux on it</p><p>EDIT: On a hack-related note, I added a second antenna to this router.</p><p>Right above the trace for the first antenna, if you de-solder the little SMD thing (I&#039;m not sure what it is L20-something) and solder in a wire, and run it out of the box, you get another antenna. Not sure what it&#039;s good for, but still.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>brnat</strong> on 3 Jul 2008, 02:57)</p>
