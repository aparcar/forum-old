					<p>Hi all!</p><p>I need to connect 80 devices (ESP8266 modules) to my wifi network. I have router TP-LINK Archer C20i which will connect only 31 devices. I have tested my friend router TP-LINK TL-WDR4300 (N750) (out of life) with OpenWRT 14.07 and this router connected 80 devices in the blink of the eye <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />So my question is: where is the limit, is it on the chipset or is this firmware issue, I mean original TP-LINK firmware cannot handle 80 wifi connections.<br />I want to test also new router TP-LINK Archer C7 (AC1750) but to be honest I don&#039;t need fancy stuff, my modules works only with 2,4GHz and in b or g mode.</p><p>I would appreciate some advice.<br />Best Regards<br />Marek</p>									</div>

					<p>C20 is a different chipset, your results may vary.&nbsp; You could try OpenWrt on it.&nbsp; C7 and 4300 should be about the same on 2.4, they are both Ath9k chips.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for answer. I have installed OpenWRT on TP-Link wr841 V11 but there was no LuCI and I couldn&#039;t install it due to - No space left on device. I have noticed that is has hostapd-common package installed on it, so OpenWRT uses Hostapd to manage wifi connections? I&#039;m using Hostapd now on the computer with wifi card but it tends to hang up, on the other hand I&#039;m not experienced with Hostapd so maybe my config is the problem.</p>									</div>

					<p>Download a release image for your WR841, it will include LuCI.</p><p>Hostapd is used in almost every device that acts as a WiFi AP.&nbsp; Hostapd sets up the connection initially, checking password etc. then the kernel driver handles moving data once connected.&nbsp; The default in OpenWrt is to configure hostapd to accept 150 users, but that can be changed.</p>									</div>

					<p>LEDE has a build specifically for the v11.&nbsp; Though I would think the CC v10 build should be about the same, as it&#039;s the same chipset just a different firmware ID in the factory firmware.<br /><a href="http://downloads.lede-project.org/releases/17.01.2/targets/ar71xx/generic/lede-17.01.2-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr841-v11-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin">http://downloads.lede-project.org/relea â€¦ pgrade.bin</a><br />This LEDE file contains LuCI.<br />I have a couple of WR841V11 running that firmware, though I have upgraded the flash to 16 MB so I can install OpenVPN etc.&nbsp; The 4MB chip is still adequate if you&#039;re not going to add <em>anything</em> later.&nbsp; You should not need to add anything to test if it can connect to your 80 users.</p><p>The C20i is a MediaTek chip so it uses an entirely differnet kernel driver.&nbsp; I would also use LEDE there to get newer drivers.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 29 Aug 2017, 16:57)</p>

					<p>well I&#039;m becoming angry, another bricked router, LEDE from download page creates boot loop for Archer C20i V1.1 and recovery with tftp killed it completely only power led is ON everythjing else is dead, even holding reset at power on does not work, router does not download firmware.
