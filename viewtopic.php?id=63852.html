					<p>When you first build an openwrt device, you telnet into it and enable ssh by creating a password.<br />I have an odd situation where my build didn&#039;t allow ssh but I did include a script which the device picks up when it boots and that seems to be working.</p><p>So the question is, what command line commands could I send the device via the script that would enable ssh access? At this time, there are no services what so ever running on it but it does boot and does pick up that script so I have a chance at recovery <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>projects</strong> on 17 Apr 2016, 02:06)</p>

					<p>I tested this a lot and here is what I found.</p><p>I found that the device is definitely picking up the script from the server when it reboots.<br />I removed the script from the server to see if the device is actually picking it up and it is. It would not run the script until I put it back and it was able to pick it up.</p><p>However, no matter what commands I put in the script, the device never runs any of it but it does run one small function in the script confirming that it is running the script. </p><p>This is completely weird and I cannot gain access to that device nor can I even get into a rescue mode. </p><p>What a waste, 3 dead, 2 to go.</p>									</div>
