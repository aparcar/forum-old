					<p>Hello,</p><p>Have anyone successfully added an humidity sensor to a openwrt router?<br />I have a openwrt router with I2C (PCF8574) and 1-W (DS18B20), and now the next step would be to acquire humidity values, but it seems there is nothing about it around...</p><p>Any idea?</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br />jabss</p>									</div>

					<p>There should be combined temperature and humidity sensors called SHT10 or SHT15. And, from what I recall, Honeywell has got some in their HIH series. Have a look at the hwmon section of the kernel to see what&#039;s already supported by the kernel, or of openwrt to see what&#039;s included.</p>									</div>

					<p>What would be the easiest way to connect a humidity sensor to Openwrt? I&#039;m thinking about using an Arduino and DHT22, but is there some way to connect a DHT22 (or some other cheap sensor) directly to a GPIO pin on Openwrt? I guess the problem is that there are no drivers for DHT22 in Openwrt?</p>									</div>

					<p>Easiest might be some USB connected humidity sensor with Linux-support (assuming that your router has an USB port).</p><p>Googling <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=humidity+sensor+usb+linux">https://www.google.com/search?q=humidit … +usb+linux</a> produced this as the first result:<br /><a href="http://dograt.homelinux.com:8080/products/index.php/menu-sensors/menu-usb-tnh-sht10">http://dograt.homelinux.com:8080/produc … -tnh-sht10</a><br />Linux drivers are provided as GPL source code, so it could probably work in Openwrt environment.</p><p>Something like that would probably be easiest as it would not require hardware modifications (and most likely no kernel modifications).</p>									</div>

					<p>Alternative solution in case money doesn&#039;t matter that much and in case you already have 1-wire environment installed: google for &quot;OW-ENV-THPL&quot;</p><p>There are multiple sensors available, with THPL being the one who has the most sensors (i.e. Temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, light intensity (lux)). There are other sensors available with only T + Rh which cost less.</p><p>Yes, those sensors aren&#039;t exactly cheap, but installation and readout is quite easy.</p><p>One more drawback regarding 1-wire: owfs in combination with a DS9490R busmaster is quite unstable, so you have to take care of this instability in your readout scripts.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi there!</p><p>A humidity &amp; temperature sensor would be funny to play with <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />The DHT11 / DHT22 look quite promissing, due to their low prices, but i was wondering wether someone got this working on openWrt or not?</p><p>I&#039;m quite new to openWrt and GPIO but i&#039;d like to get a little more into this.</p><p>Therefor: What hardware does have GPIO pins and might be working with one of those two sensors?</p><p>The devel mailing list at:<br /><a href="https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/2014-September/028232.html">https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/ope … 28232.html</a><br />states: &quot; + support for DHT11 and DHT22 digitial humidity and temperature&quot;</p><p>so i hope the sensors could work; hardware seems to be a problem though.</p><br /><p>Any ideas or thoughts about this?</p><p>Thanks in advance!<br />Z oc om</p>									</div>

					<p>another idea is the next:</p><p>-a temperature/humidity sensor from a wireless weather station and receive its signal with a RTL2832U dongle (DVB-T usb dongle that can be used in &quot;SDR - Software Defined Radio&quot;)&nbsp; in a openwrt router with &quot;rtlsdr&quot; package installed.</p>									</div>
