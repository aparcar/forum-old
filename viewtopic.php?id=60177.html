					<p>We have a /29 subnet on our WAN and I would like to use all of them through OpenWRT.</p><p>Can I configure this through the luci gui?</p><p>If not I assume iptables is involved.&nbsp; Can anyone give me an example to get started with?&nbsp; I just want to port forward from WAN to LAN specific ports.&nbsp; I don&#039;t need 1:1 NAT and don&#039;t need the computer to go outbound on that specific IP, just inbound ports.</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated, I am trying to switch from DD-WRT to OpenWRT for the extra features.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve never done that, but I guess you should create interfaces with the IP addresses you are going to use and link them to the master interface using the custom interface @wan</p><p>Then, you can play with Source NAT rules in luci.</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>									</div>
