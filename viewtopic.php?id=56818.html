					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to enable/disable openVPN on my OpenWRT router with port knocking.<br />I already have Portknocking working with SSH access and works great, and since OpenVPN doesn&#039;t seem very stable on BB (not comming up always on every reboot - needs &quot;/etc/init.d/openvpn restart&quot; now and then), I thought on doing the same for it. This way, I could have control on when it should be running or not.</p><p>I admit I don&#039;t fully understand iptables and all the configuration I did for OpenVPN (which by the way is working) I copied from <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/vpn.howto/">here</a>.</p><p>So, I&#039;d like to block/close all OpenVPN traffic on the router by default and implement a script that when called, opens/unblocks it.</p><p>The first thing I need to know is what would be the command line equivalent to this UCI configuration:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;rule&#039;
        option &#039;target&#039; &#039;ACCEPT&#039;
        option &#039;name&#039; &#039;VPN&#039;
        option &#039;src&#039; &#039;wan&#039;
        option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;udp&#039;
        option &#039;dest_port&#039; &#039;1194&#039;</code></pre></div><p>I tried several combinations around &quot;iptables -t wan -p udp --dport 1194 -j ACCEPT&quot; but had no luck...</p><p>Then, I think I will also need to close/block this rule again, so I&#039;ll have to do the opposite.</p><p>I&#039;m assuming this firewall rule would be enough to close/block the openVPN traffic. Am I right?</p><p>Any suggestions that could point me into the right direction?</p><p>Cheers,<br />Jabss</p>									</div>
