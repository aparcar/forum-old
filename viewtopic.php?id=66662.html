					<p>Okay, had some issues but I managed to install OpenWrt (Driver 49876) and configure networking as desired. Everything went just fine after the first step. Here is what I did, in case it helps someone else:</p><p>1 - Had to downgrade the OEM firmware, because some new protection that was implemented on newer versions prevents third-party software from being installed. I was on 3.7.5, and according to some research, some people had success using 3.4.7, but Ubiquiti website doesn&#039;t have it available anymore. So I found it here: <a href="https://jonbither.com/unifi/firmware/U7PG2/3.4.7.3284/firmware.bin">https://jonbither.com/unifi/firmware/U7 … rmware.bin</a></p><p>2 - Installed OpenWrt as told in the wiki page: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/ubiquiti/unifiac">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/ubiquiti/unifiac</a>. ps.: the link to the firmware in the page is broken, so I got it from here: <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-ubnt-unifiac-lite-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin">https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots … pgrade.bin</a> (for <strong>UAP-AC Lite</strong>)</p><p>3 - Installed Luci following these instructions: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials</a></p><p>4 - As the Ethernet and Wireless interfaces were already bridged, I just created and configured a new (guest) wireless interface, enabled DHCP server for it, enabled FORWARD in the Firewall section and set SNAT to source (LAN) IP address.</p><p>Now something that I didn&#039;t find on Luci or via command line is how (or whether is possible) to enable the 5 GHz band. Here is the output of &#039;iw phy&#039;:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# iw phy

					<p>Thank you for confirming the updated steps for installing OpenWrt on the UAP-AC-Lite and posting a link for the downgraded firmware. I do find the Ubiquiti Unifi software too restrictive for home use environment and want to try OpenWrt on the AP as well. </p><p>Will you share the stability of the AP after flashing with OpenWrt? I have a TP-Link C7 running OpenWrt but I find that I have to reboot it daily to maintain optimal WiFi performance (maybe network throughput as well). I have not had to do it with the UAP-AC-Lite running latest firmware from Ubiquiti yet.</p><p>My plan is to use the UAP-AC-Lite 5 GHZ on WDS mode and use 2.4 GHZ in client mode and bridge the two wireless interfaces. This will allow me to use the 5 GHZ band to extend the 2.4 GHZ band. I have successfully tested this on a WD router but will post the results when I try this on the UAP-AC-lite.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rlin78</strong> on 22 Aug 2016, 16:16)</p>

					<p>Hi, unfortunately it won&#039;t be possible for me to confirm you that. This specific AP device is only on during working hours; the majority of the power lines are turned off during the night (for safety reasons). I also hadn&#039;t the opportunity to test the 5GHz bandwidth performance, or several active concurrent downloads to test the throughput even at 2.4Ghz.<br />I can just confirm it is stable with something around 20~30 simultaneous clients who aren&#039;t actively using their devices all the time, and using both bands.<br />Sorry I couldn&#039;t be more helpful.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello all,</p><p>i&#039;m very interested in what br.larini says (configure NAT and dhcp service on the AP).<br />In particular, if i buy the model with 2 ethernet interfaces (UAP-AC-PRO), would be possible to use them as two separated network interfaces (each with an IP address on different networks), then bridge both the interfaces in as many SSID?<br />Other question: do you know if the ethernet port supports 802.1Q?<br />In this way i might buy the LITE model and bring all the necessary VLANs on a trunk link.</p><p>Thanks in advance and best regards,</p><p>Edoardo</p>									</div>

					<p>Openwrt supports VLAN tagging, and each SSID can be associated with a different interface and can be assigned a completely different subnet. I am not sure how stable it is and I don&#039;t understand why you want to try to do this on an UniFi Access Point because the limited number of ports available. It&#039;s also not straight forward to setup OpenWrt on the UAP as you can see. </p><p>I would pick up a mid-grade NetGear or TP-Link wireless router that supports OpenWrt for $50-$60. you get all 5 GiG ports, and be ready to spend a few hours setting it up because the way you are asking these questions leads me to believe you have some networking experience, but not on OpenWrt. There&#039;s a somewhat big learning curve with OpenWrt for advance networking.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you rlin,<br />the reason is simple: with the wifi Range declareted by the datasheet, i would be able to cover all the area that i need. Now to achieve this i&#039;m using 3 TP link all with openwrt in WDS mode. They perform enough well, but the hardware is quite dated (two TL-WR841N and a TL-WDR4300) and i would upgrade to AC. In the past i had some good experience with Ubiquiti products, and the cost of a single AP is quite similar (or smaller) to many AC solutions provided by TP, Netgear and so on.</p>									</div>

					<p>I only have a UAP AC Lite, I can tell you that range is about the same as TP-Link C7 that I have, maybe even slightly worse.
