					<p>Is there any way to use the simplicity of Personal style configuration (where there is no configuration required) at enterprise level dimensions? Enterprise wireless systems are very complicated as they often require a configuration and possibly even a software installation (for windows). </p><p>So is there anyway to have multiple WPA login passwords that are something like &quot;login/password&quot; instead of the usual single password &quot;password&quot;.</p><p>AND</p><p>Is there any way to have this function within a RADIUS server lookup?</p><p>Or is the WPA password fed into the driver directly, and is therefore not really looked up through the OS space at all?</p>									</div>
