					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m getting the above error message in dmesg when I plug in a USB flash drive on my WNDR3700v3 router with OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05.1. I found past threads on this, but they were for older versions of OpenWrt, and the solution given doesn&#039;t work:</p><p>root@OpenWrt:~# opkg install kmod-nls-cp437 kmod-nls-5589-1<br />Unknown package &#039;kmod-nls-cp437&#039;.<br />Unknown package &#039;kmod-nls-5589-1&#039;.<br />Collected errors:<br /> * opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package kmod-nls-cp437.<br /> * opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package kmod-nls-5589-1.</p><p>I have all the other needed packages for mounting USB drives, and the drive is being recognized. But it seems that these packages are missing.&nbsp; I did an &quot;opkg update&quot; first.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Ron</p>									</div>
