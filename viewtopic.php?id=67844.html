					<p>Hi everyone.</p><p>I just flashed CHAOS CALMER (15.05.1, r48532) on my TPlink WR841ND v9. I would like to use it to repeat a wireless signal in my apartment, as the wireless signal of the router (Unitymedia Connect Box) connected to the WAN is weak. As the router has proprietary firmware, there is not much configuration that can be done there, but I want it to serve as wireless AP. </p><p>The tplink I configured as a WDS client according to the guide posted in viewtopic.php?id=46544. So I connected it to the router as a WDS Client, disabled DHCP, gave it a static IP. </p><p>Router IP: 192.168.0.1<br />TPlink IP: 192.168.0.10 (static)</p><p>Now the tplink seems to fail to connect to the AP&#039;s network, this is the log I get:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Sun Jan 31 19:37:01 2016 daemon.notice netifd: Network device &#039;wlan0&#039; link is down
