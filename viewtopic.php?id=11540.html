					<p>Hi could someone tell me which is the best VPN client between FreeSwan and OpenVPN in terms of processing power on my little 200mhz chip?!</p><p>PPTP is as im told pretty much insecure, however if it can run much faster as a client connecting to my remote server then i will certainly consider it (as long as it is still reasonably hard to eavesdrop).</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p><p>Chris</p>									</div>

					<p>What&#039;s your connection speed? If you have limited upload of e.g. 128 KByte/sec, the cpu will not be the bottleneck.</p><p>I chose openvpn, because it&#039;s flexible for port selection, doesn&#039;t have problems with NAT or requires special kernel modules to work.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MMCM</strong> on 8 Jul 2007, 11:24)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the reply MMCM. The speed is on 100mbit in the datacenter to which all the OpenWrt boxes will be connecting (maybe upto 30 OpenWrt clients will be connecting to this approx 750MHz server as its a Virtual Private Server), each OpenWrt on the client side will only NAT traffic for a small subnet of 3 to 4 computers.</p>									</div>

					<p>What is the connection speed of the client units, not the server.</p><p>Just as importantly, how much traffic will go over the VPN? I have a PoP site with OpenVPN running on WRTSL54GS (266 MHz CPU) but am only using OpenVPN for RADIUS authentication and a few other lightweight purposes.&nbsp; &nbsp;There are situations where you want the entire datastream going over the VPN, is yours one of those?&nbsp; Mainly I see it for office where they want PC to have access to only company resources and not general web browsing etc.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 8 Jul 2007, 19:20)</p>

					<p>Chris, I suggest testing the various encryption options in OpenVPN and measure them for yourself.&nbsp; I suspect blowfish (which I run... BF-CBC which I think is still OpenVPN default)) will be faster and aes will be slower.&nbsp; Simple as that.&nbsp; While everyone wants to run the state-of-the-art aes I think you&#039;ll find it really unneeded and also hits the cpu far more than you&#039;ll want.</p><p>That said, I&#039;d stay away from pptp altogether.</p><p>Too bad more boxes couldn&#039;t lunch off encryption in hardware.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Bill_MI</strong> on 9 Jul 2007, 02:13)</p>

					<p>If you are looking for the fastest one then I will recommend you to try best <a href="http://www.vpnchoice.com/blog/uk-vpn/">UK vpn</a> connection, but let me tell you one thing about vpn connection, no doubt it is the fastest Service provider in the industry but it is&nbsp; little expensive as compared to others, I am personally using their services and quite happy with the services.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>martinpouis198</strong> on 14 Feb 2012, 20:29)</p>
