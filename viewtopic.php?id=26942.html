					<p>First of all, this forum is for posting actual HowTos, not asking questions, the area you wanted is General Discussions.&nbsp; Hopefully an op can move this thread.</p><p>It would be helpful to know exactly which version of OpenWrt you are running (WhiteRussian, Kamikaze, Backfire, exact version), and if you&#039;re wanting to do this via the web interface, or via the command line.&nbsp; For command line access, you can usually ssh to your router, assuming you don&#039;t have a serial port with console access.</p><p>Once you supply this info, someone can get you more specific help.</p>									</div>

					<p>bulgaria_mitko, lots of unhelpful folks here, sorry about that.&nbsp; My WhiteRussian skills are a bit rusty, but have a look at this page, it should have the default firewall.user settings:</p><p><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/branches/whiterussian/openwrt/package/base-files/default/etc/firewall.user?rev=3319">https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/branche … r?rev=3319</a></p><p>On your router, you&#039;ll need to open an SSH connection (you mentioned you were using putty, this will work), from there you will need to edit the /etc/firewall.user file for the forwards you want done.&nbsp; The vi editor is built in, there are numerous guides on using this editor on the net.</p><p>The sample document above has three main sections, the first (Open port to WAN) opens ports to the router itself, for services that are handled by that device.&nbsp; The next section (Port forwarding) is for forwarding ports to other machines on your LAN.&nbsp; The last section is for setting up a DMZ, and that&#039;s a whole different topic, and is likely not what you&#039;re needing.</p><br /><p>You may want to make a backup of this file on your router before making any changes, that way you can quickly revert if your changes cause problems.&nbsp; If you are still stuck, post the contents of your file and detail what changes you need, and we can figure it out.</p>									</div>
