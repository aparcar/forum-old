					<p>So, I&#039;ve grabbed the released bits of BB and built an image from scratch, and all is well.&nbsp; There are one or two packages that appear to be in the deprecated status at the moment, specifically ushare, and the luci-app-ushare that goes with it.&nbsp; I have no problem installing those with opkg from the built snapshot on the release site, but I have been unable to figure out exactly what I need to change to get those packages to appear in make menuconfig so that I can build them myself to include them in the built image directly.</p><p>I&#039;m sure this must be something simple that I&#039;m missing, but I haven&#039;t been able to find the magic incantation on my own.&nbsp; Any pointers?</p><p>Thanks-</p>									</div>

					<p>Not going to answer your question, but anywayâ€¦ with the Image Builder you can just download the prebuilt packages (that you want) from oldpackages, and put them in the packages directory of the Image Builder, and generate your custom image with them. So I suppose you can build from scratch (if that is what you need), and request the Image Builder to be built, and then use the Image Builder to include the deprecated packages in your image. Unless you build with significantly different/incompatible options of course. This will not help at all, if you want to compile the deprecated packages yourself.</p>									</div>
