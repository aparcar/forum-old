					<p>I saw some activity in my google searchs on this topic that took place some time in March of 2012. However, when I get &#039;trunk&#039; there is no mention of P1020 RDB or WLAN in the file:</p><p>target/linux/mpc85xx/image/Makefile</p><p>The only &#039;target&#039; seems to be</p><p>mpc8648cds</p><p>And the patches-3.3 folder only seems to have patches associated with that platform.</p><p>In the linux-3.3.8 kernel hierarchy, there are configurations for the P1020 RDB as well as several other mpc85xx platforms.</p><p>The question is... where, if they exist, are the configurations and pataches for the p1020.</p><p>I attempted to access:</p><p><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/wiki/GetSource">https://dev.openwrt.org/wiki/GetSource</a></p><p>And I get a &#039;502 Bad Gateway&#039; html error page.</p><p>The Freescale supplied &#039;ltib&#039; package has an ancient kernel version, 2.6.32, and relative to my needs for Atheros support, way out of date.</p>									</div>
