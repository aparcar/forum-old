					<p>I have an Archer C7 V2 that I may have bricked trying to do the serial port mod on it, it turns on and currently only functions as a switch. I never did get console output from it so I can&#039;t tell if it&#039;s actually dead, doesn&#039;t have an IP, or the firmware is borked. I have the power supply for it.</p><p>20 USD, you pay the shipping.</p>									</div>

					<p>It seems like the resistors/capacitors near pin #2 may be damaged. Hard to say. If you were not able to make the serial connection work, that might be the reason. BTW: I would suggest to use just jumper cables with male ends next time ... much less intrusive.</p><p>I am not saying that the router is a total brick ... maybe JTAG would still work just fine and you would be able to use it to reflash.</p>									</div>

					<p>Much as I hate to say this, but I think its toast - almost literally. <br />In addition the the comments by pbasista, - take a look at the back side image in the&nbsp; area around the 14pin &quot;header&quot; there is a lot of heat damage, and the front side image doesn&#039;t show that area.</p>									</div>
