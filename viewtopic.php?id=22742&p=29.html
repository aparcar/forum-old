					<p>Well, slight success on my investigation. First off, I found a few more GPIOs: the onboard serial console (P1) can be used as GPIOs, but I think it might be a good idea to disable the driver for serial port in that case (either while compiling firmware image or maybe anywhere in sysfs). So the new GPIO table looks someway like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>     |               |          |   Output Value      |   Input Value

In input mode I was just unable to change their value to something different than 1. I tried to pull down to GND by temporarily connecting a 2,2k resistor - or if that failed, I connected straight with some wire. I also did some test with a pull up resistor of 2,2k to Vcc of P1. <br />Tests of GPIO10 in output mode always led to +3,3V, no matter which value was set. I guess that is caused by the serial console driver, which was still in charge. I just don&#039;t want to waste some time to disable it for one single test.<br />Now, there is even some progress on my main topic: I²C. I finally managed to get the module i2c-gpio-custom built, installed and loaded. The part of my OpenWRT-config file, which made it possible looks like that:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#
# I2C support
#
CONFIG_PACKAGE_kmod-i2c-core=y
CONFIG_PACKAGE_kmod-i2c-algo-bit=y
# CONFIG_PACKAGE_kmod-i2c-algo-pca is not set
# CONFIG_PACKAGE_kmod-i2c-algo-pcf is not set
CONFIG_PACKAGE_kmod-i2c-gpio=y
CONFIG_PACKAGE_kmod-i2c-gpio-custom=y</code></pre></div><p>Besides that, I checked in the kernel-config, that the support for I²C character device was selected. In the kernel config file the appropriate line should look like that:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>CONFIG_I2C_CHARDEV=m</code></pre></div><p>Alternatively, this option can be set to y. This module will create files like /dev/i2c-0, which are very convenient if using the i2c-tools. So far, some success. Now I hooked up a test pcb to USB- (SDA) and QSS-LED (SCL), successfully loaded the i2c-module with<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>insmod i2c-gpio-custom bus0=0,1,5</code></pre></div><p>dmesg shows that it has started the i2c-bus, the character device is created in /dev and i2cdetect works - but doesn&#039;t detect my PCA9555. Either that weird circuit logic is confusing the I²C-bus, or I did not properly solder the PCA9555 (I hate SMD soldering). I need to investigate more on that, maybe I will use QSS-Button and Reset-Button instead (though I would not have a fancy LED indicating bus access).</p><p>Finally there is another investigation. SW7 seems to be a hard reset connector. At least whenever I pulled it to GND, the device entered straight into the boot loader.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MBS</strong> on 31 Jul 2010, 01:26)</p>

					<p>@joky: First off: cool idea. Now what I would think is, your router normally outputs kernel messages on that serial port. That even continues some time after your device is accessible over ssh/telnet. So it <strong>might</strong> help to wait a certain time (2-5 minutes should do it) before trying to use minicom. Executing </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dmesg | tail</code></pre></div><p>should show you, if something was put out.<br />Another option might be to find out how to disable the binding of stderr(?) to /dev/tty0. This might be done in sysfs (one of the files you will find in /sys/), but I don&#039;t know that for sure, just a guess. Maybe google might help on that :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello, I&#039;ve bricked the WR1043ND router after..... a week after receiving it. Advice to all, if you want to update your router using the web interface, backup your settings, reset your router using the failsafe mode.

The wiki link in the page above indicates that it is possible. Pictures are worth a thousand words, too. I wonder if I need a PCI serial port on my computer too</p><p>I&#039;m thinking of a USB (router) &lt;-&gt; Serial &lt;-&gt; Serial/USB(computer). I wonder if those serial chips work both ways...</p><p>I hope to get an answer soon, I need to get this done before next week.</p><p>EDIT: I have misunderstood the above article.

As you can find in some of the first posts in this thread, some people are using certain Nokia data cables (use your browser search box with the term &quot;Nokia&quot; page by page). Or, since your soldering iron is already hot, you can build a cable with max232 level shifter, since your router operates at 3,3 V.</p>									</div>

					<p>Success - finally. I got the I²C-Bus working. After I failed with the button-GPIOs (3 aka Reset and 7 aka QSS-Button), probably due to some resistor-capacitor circuits for debouncing, I tried as a last resort GPIO 5 (aka D31, D10 or the QSS-LED) at D10 as SDA and GPIO 20 as SCL. Both hooked up with 4k7 pull-up resistors.<br />My reasons for choosing those: I checked the GPIOs of the ADM5120, especially the ones I had already successfully running as I²C-bus. In output direction, they drove 3,3V (Vcc) when a 1 was written into /sys/class/gpio/gpioX/value and 0V (GND) when a 0 was written. When used as inputs, those GPIO-values showed 0 when it was pulled to GND and 1 when pulled to Vcc (remember to use decent resistors when pulling those signals high or low - unless you want to burn your chips). The most similar behavior could be found on the GPIOs for buttons, the QSS-LED and GPIO 20. Since the buttons seem to be equipped with RC-filters, they don&#039;t seem to work at the frequencies of I²C (about 100 kHz). So I chose GPIO 20 for SCL, because it is switching every cycle, and I could not find any filters connected to GPIO 20. GPIO 5 is just the last remaining one, so it got used for SDA. I&#039;m not really willed to rip off parts of the pcb to make other GPIOs become usable.<br />Another interesting fact that I found out: if you unbind the serial8250 driver (using sysfs) and set GPIO 13 (aka P1-Rx) to output, you can reset your device by switching that GPIO from high (1) to low (0). This can also be achieved by entering something on a connected serial console. Quite weird.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ah well, I followed the wiki. They put headers, I put headers (I think it&#039;s a great idea too) and use a floppy connector, which you can get plenty on many shops (and spare power supplies). Anyway, I got everything soldered, by simply adding molten solder into the hole from the back to clog the hole through. I wanted to make the headers go through the hole though, but I guess it&#039;s too tough for me for now. As long as it works, a hackjob is fine. Don&#039;t fix anything that&#039;s not broken, people said.
