					<p>I&#039;m having some trouble getting OpenVPN to work (WNDR3700v2). I&#039;m trying to use it in a client configuration with PIA. I think I&#039;ve got everything set up properly, but when I try to actually launch the connection, nothing happens. I&#039;ve tried via the luci interface (just says started: no) as well as via the command line (/etc/init.d/openvpn start). There&#039;s no openvpn process, and no logs generated that I can see. How do I get some diagnostic information?</p><p>My /etc/config/openvpn config is as follows:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config openvpn &#039;PIA_East&#039;
        option client &#039;1&#039;
        option comp_lzo &#039;yes&#039;
        option reneg_sec &#039;0&#039;
        option persist_key &#039;1&#039;
        option nobind &#039;1&#039;
        option remote_cert_tls &#039;server&#039;
        option persist_tun &#039;1&#039;
        option remote &#039;us-east.privateinternetaccess.com 1194&#039;
        option remote_random &#039;0&#039;
        option ca &#039;/lib/uci/upload/cbid.openvpn.PIA_East.ca&#039;
        option crl_verify &#039;/etc/openvpn/crl.pem&#039;
        option dev &#039;tun&#039;
        option resolv_retry &#039;infinite&#039;
        option proto &#039;udp&#039;
        option tls_client &#039;1&#039;
        option auth_user_pass &#039;/etc/openvpn/userpass.txt&#039;
        option enabled &#039;1&#039;

					<p>I didn&#039;t verify line by line with mine (and I found that tcp works better for me), but it looks alright.</p><p>Not sure if that&#039;s the reason but I do: &quot;chmod 0400 /etc/openvpn/userpass.txt&quot;.</p><p>Do you get the proper OpenVPN config file generated from uci settings in /tmp/etc/? If you do, you can start openvpn binary (not the init script) with that config file and see in the console where it breaks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stangri</strong> on 5 May 2016, 08:59)</p>

					<p>Aha, thanks! I&#039;m not really used to working with openwrt&#039;s config files, it didn&#039;t occur to me that openvpn couldn&#039;t process /etc/openvpn directly. Once I had the actual config file to feed it from the command line, I discovered that...I hadn&#039;t saved the userpass.txt file. So, that&#039;s embarrassing. But, it works, with all the 11Mbit glory that this CPU can handle! Thanks for your help!</p>									</div>

I can&#039;t recall if the files there need to be .conf or .ovpn for OpenWrt tho. Doing things thru UCI in OpenWrt is more elegant imho. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>
