					<p>I&#039;m interested in upgrading my wrt54gl ram to 64. From what i&#039;ve read, this chip, NT5DS32M16BS-5T, can be used without problems. However I can&#039;t find it anymore. Are there alternative modules? Or does someone know where to find one of these NT5DS32M16BS-5T chips?</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>									</div>
