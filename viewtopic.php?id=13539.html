					<p>Hi,<br />I recently installed kamikaze on my WRT54GL for the purpose of being able to do content filtering on packets. I.e. I want to intercept all packets and then decide on whether to let them through based on a static filter list.<br />Now I can read all packets going through the router via TCPdump, but I can only sniff them as they go by and not block them. I&#039;m rather unsure on where and how to begin to modify the software to do the above.<br />Any pointers or help of any kind would be much appreciated.<br />Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>actual data content, or just the packet headers?</p><p>if headers (ip address, mac address, tcp/udp port, ip protocol type, etc), use iptables firewall rules.<br />if not:<br /><a href="http://l7-filter.sourceforge.net">http://l7-filter.sourceforge.net</a>/ - read the faq, the focus of this is more on classification for qos, rather then outright blocking, and it&#039;s hard to identify a protocol before the connection is established and data is being sent.<br />if you want to filter content for a particular protocol, use a proxy (like squid for http) with it&#039;s own rules</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi grinner,</p><p>you&#039;ve just embarked on a long but exciting journey. There&#039;s a lot to learn about what packages to let into your homely network and how to find out which is which.<br />But fear not: you have a wise companion named Google. (On a sidenote: he&#039;s not really wise, just an attention whore who adopts the opinion of anyone out there screaming the loudest, but I digress...)<br />I talked to him just the other minute, only to make sure: the words &quot;linux ip content filtering&quot; were sufficient to provide fun for many long nights (more than 200,000 links).<br />He kept mumbling about &quot;squidGuard&quot;, so pr&#039;aps this is a point to focus on ...<br />(answer provided in a true &quot;grinning&quot; fashion <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /> )</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MKunert</strong> on 28 Nov 2007, 11:56)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m trying to filter actual data content regardless of traffic type. Specifically I&#039;m want to scan packets for specific cleartext and mark these packets. At least for now that&#039;s all I need to do, it&#039;s a project in a security class in the uni and I&#039;m quite new to all of this stuff.</p><p>Level 7 Filter looks pretty good and I&#039;m sure I can steal some ideas from there <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />I&#039;ll check out this mr. google guy everyone keeps rambling on about. Maybe he actually can help me <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>So far my first problem has been where to start within the router so I can actually control traffic. I mean the basic routing functionality is built in pretty deep and I&#039;m not sure if I can just turn it off, or if I have to replace it completely. <br />Any pointers or ideas there would be great, as that would get me started and I&#039;m kinda lost right now...</p><p>Thanks a lot.</p>									</div>
