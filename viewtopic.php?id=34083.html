					<p>Hello,</p><p>Recently I had the local FTTH installed in my apartment from the local ISP Bell Aliant. They installed a ONT along with their own Actiontec router. This router... to say the least its a piece of junk. It will not how every many times I try port forward which I need since I host my website and TeamSpeak 3 server here. There are some ways using a Linux router (custom build) to setup the VLAN&#039;s to mimic the setup on the Actiontec router. This is what I would like to do with OpenWRT if possible and remove the Actiontec router out of the picture.</p><p>Details about the FibreOp Infrastructure: <a href="http://www.digitalhome.ca/forum/showthread.php?t=134496">http://www.digitalhome.ca/forum/showthread.php?t=134496</a></p><p>Basically I need to:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Setup VLAN35 with a priority of 3 to point to the WAN port I assume?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Remove the DHCP Client ID.</p><p>[ONT]----&gt;[My OpenWRT Router (NetGear WNDR3700v2)]----&gt;[LAN Network (Includes a 8 port NetGear Switch)]</p><p>I&#039;ve tried to mimic what I&#039;ve read on the post above but not every have setup VLANs before... I&#039;m lost.</p><p>Any help with this would be greatly appreciated!.</p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Temp102</strong> on 14 Jan 2012, 00:14)</p>
