					<p>I&#039;m currently living in China and I&#039;m looking for some help with finding a solution to de-google my internet. I&#039;m not very well versed in OpenWRT, so I&#039;m not 100% sure this can be accomplished (or if anyone has done it already)</p><p>I&#039;ve noticed over the past couple of years living here that more and more websites outside of the firewall will load stuff from Google (analytics/fonts/ajax/AMP etc.) and it&#039;s leaving the internet more and more broken for us here. Some of this I can just block (like analytics and ads) but a lot of it is necessary and more importantly <em>could</em> be loaded from alternate websites. I guess the real issues is that webmasters are not adding JS fallbacks to have resources loaded from somewhere other than google (or hosting the resources themselves). So I&#039;m looking for some solution, ideally on an OpenWRT router, that will redirect the javascript/fonts requests away from Google to some alternative hosts (a local cache would also be fantastic - but I don&#039;t want to ask for too much <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> ).</p><p>I know I probably don&#039;t have a very popular use case, but I&#039;d have thought someone has done it for privacy reasons by now as well</p><p>PS: I know I can &quot;just use a VPN&quot;, which I do for now, but they&#039;re unstable, have terrible support and have other issues. At the end of the day the way I see it, VPNs are a bit of dirty hack and I really don&#039;t like using them</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not the best person to answer you here but seeing as nobody else has.....</p><p>Just to clarify... You want to make sure that any websites you access from your own network don&#039;t have Google links coming in?</p><p>You&#039;re not talking about Google&#039;s search engine looking at your own hosted website? </p><p>Sounds like a squid proxy cache &#039;might&#039; work (available on openwrt provided you have a powerful enough router). Also, who knows when that content might change.</p><p>Same with an adblock, hosts file update or other. You may be able to block a band of known sites but these will probably change over time. There may be a site that keeps track of known adwords/google etc sites. I&#039;ll have a look.</p>									</div>

					<p>I can give you a more concrete example <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I got to stackoverflow. com. It loads and it sorta works, but some parts don&#039;t work correctly in China.<br />So I open up the source (Ctrl-U) and line 20 reads</p><p>&lt;script src=&quot;googlestuff/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.4/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p><p>This will not load from here (and I guess for the privacy conscious.. this will send a request to Google..)</p><p>I got to the JQuery website: jquery. com/download/ <br />and you can find that this javascript thing is hosted in a few other places (run by Microsoft and the like)<br />like for instance ajax. aspnetcdn. com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-1.12.4.min.js<br />or<br />cdnjs. cloudflare. com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.4/jquery.min.js</p><p>So what I&#039;d like to see happen would be each time the router sees a request for, for instance, this jquery thing, it would get it from some alternate host. I&#039;d guess maybe some DNS magic to have googleapis. com resolve to some alternate IP? More concretely, in the second alternate host I posted the file paths match, so maybe I can get ajax.googleapis. com to resolve to the IP of cdnjs.cloudflare. com ? I&#039;m not sure if that would work or how I&#039;d go about doing that</p><p>PS: I had to break the links b/c it&#039;s not letting me post links (I guess an antispam feature)</p>									</div>

					<p>In the pre-https internet, a proxy could have done this on the fly. With the strong push for https everywhere this is no longer possible - and the multitude of layered external inclusions in today&#039;s would make this a losing game as well.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you use Firefox (or a similar browser), would the Decentraleyes extension help with your requirements? It purports to intercept requests to content delivery networks and deal with them locally. I don&#039;t know - I haven&#039;t read - if Google is handled by Decentraleyes or not.

					<p>Unfortunately, slh is correct.<br />In case, you only would have to deal with http:, willing to endure quite a lot of work to detect the working replacements for googles blocked URLs, you could configure squid (proxy) to replace these URLs. <br />Assuming, that the replacements themselves would not reference a blocked google URL again, you were set.</p><p>But you can not do this for https easily, may be, even not at all.<br />In case, you have access to all the clients, you can intercept (most of) https using squid by installation of private certs and do some kind of redirect.<br />But to make this work is a very steep learning curve, and browser dependent and becoming harder and harder over time and host dependent and ...</p><p>Your idea of using DNS-trick to do the REDIR might work in case of only the hostname has to be (secretly) redirected.<br />But this also breaks, in case of &quot;Pinned Certificates&quot; for https, which are in wide use for google.com etc. </p><p>Most likely, a VPN-based solution is much simpler and much more reliable. Although there are rumours, that the Great Firewall also blocks VPN-connections by purpose. So a good VPN provider might work today for you, but not tomorrow any more. </p><p>A theoretical approach just popped up: To modify &quot;Adblock&quot; for firefox.&nbsp; <br />Lemme know, if you dare to walk this difficult route.</p>									</div>

					<p>Just wanted to thank you guys. Guess the easier solution is to use Decentraleyes. I seems to be working for me. It doesn&#039;t cover all the usecases - but nonetheless - it&#039;s pretty good! HTTPS is a blessing and curse. The firewall does block VPNs, but due to HTTPS they can&#039;t block subdomains (so for example, English Wikipedia works and you can access any article you want. Even on &quot;sensitive&quot; topics)</p>									</div>

					<p>You&#039;re welcome. Glad it&#039;s useful. I realise it&#039;s not perfect, but it sounds like it&#039;s better than nothing.</p>									</div>
