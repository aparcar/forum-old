					<p>I have FunnelWeb 2014-04-14a on a TP-Link MR3420 with a Huawei E3276 4G dongle. A local laptop connects to the internet via the wifi interface. I can access the router with ssh from the laptop with &quot;ssh -l root 192.168.1.1&quot;, no problems.</p><p>Now I would like to remotely access the router from a computer from the outside world. Although I have checked &quot;Allow remote hosts to connect...&quot; in System|Administration&quot; I cannot connect from the outside world. From the &quot;inside laptop&#039;s&quot; web browser I browse for <a href="http://checkip.dyndns.com">http://checkip.dyndns.com</a> and so I get my external ip, e.g. 95.195.10.44. Then I try &quot;ssh -l root 95.195.10.44&quot; but get a timeout after a while. I haven&#039;t changed default port 22. What else do I have to do to connect?</p>									</div>

					<p>Check ip of the wan interface. Do you have the same public IP there? The mobile providers in here do not serve public IP adresses. On the checkip page I see some public IP, but on the wan interface I have 10.x.x.x. You will have to use something like n2n to get to your router without public IP (which worked for me in the past, but it is not supported in openwrt anymore).</p>									</div>

					<p>Hrm, another ip, you are right. My external ip now reports 95.195.159.54, and the wan interface reports 10.55.127.54/30. Shouldn&#039;t I be able to ssh to 10.55.127.54 then? </p><p>Another issue is that I have problems with forwarding. I want to remotely control a computer within the local network from internet and that is certainly no problem when I use my adsl-connection on another router. But with this 4G-setup I cannot. Related problems? Even if I try both ip:s I cannot connect. Perhaps I have to buy one of these dedicated 4G routers after all? I hoped that OpenWRT should be the answer to my connection issues.</p>									</div>

					<p>Having 10.* IP means you cant accept ipv4 incoming connections.<br />You can setup teredo IPV6 and use it to access internal network from outside.<br />Or you can use remote administration programs such as TeamViewer or AmmyAdmin. They use their servers as relay.</p>									</div>

If you are lucky, you can reach that ip using the same ISP, but they will likely have p2p communication between customers blocked too I think.</p>									</div>
