					<p>Hi All,</p><p>Here&#039;s my setup:</p><p>[PC1] + [XBOX] ---------------------- [WRT54GS (OpenWRT)] })})})})})})}) [DG834GT (Connection to ADSL Internet)] ---------------------- [PC2] + [PC3]</p><br /><p>KEY:</p><p>---------- = Ethernet<br />)})})})} = Wireless</p><p>My Xbox and first PC are connected to the [WRT54GS] running OpenWRT via. ethernet. This is then connected to my Netgear [DG834GT] (stock netgear firmware) via. Wireless Client Bridge (the [WRT54GS] is in client mode). This is the router that has the connection to the internet. [PC2] and [PC3] are then connected via. Ethernet to the DG834GT.</p><p>[PC2] and [PC3] are both assigned IP addresses via. the [DG834GT]&#039;s DHCP server, both have no problem seeing each other when placed on the same network (in this case network is MSHOME). However they cannot see [PC1] or [XBOX] when placed on the same network.</p><p>[PC1] + [XBOX] are both assigned IP addresses via. the [WRT54GS]&#039;s DHCP server, both have no problem seeing each other when placed on the same network (in this case network is MSHOME). They cannot see [PC2] or [PC3] BUT have no problem accessing the [DG834GT] router config.</p><p>So my question is, how can I get everything in this network to see each other? I need at least the [WRT54GS] to be able to assign IPs via DHCP as this ensures that the KAI daemon I have running works properly.</p><p>Thanks in Advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>Still haven&#039;t been able to fix this problem. It effectively means that the two networks are isolated from each other, How do I get them to see each other??</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />I have more or less the same configuration except for PC1, PC1 is connected to the network wireless to the NETGEAR.<br />I successfully configured the Fonera with dd-wrt to allow my xbox to join the same network.<br />The xbox can see the other PC but the connection seams to be not very stable because I can stream less than 1 minute for video stream from my PC.<br />I&#039; like to try openwrt on the fonera. Could you please tell me how to configure the Fonera in the same way you did?<br />Thank<br />Claudio</p>									</div>
