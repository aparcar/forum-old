					<p>In my case i was using my router with squashfs-factory firmware which is bigger than sysupgrade. So i just upgraded to sysupgrade firmware and the magic happened. Free space to edit config files, upgrade packages and et cetera.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dibelonious</strong> on 19 May 2015, 07:58)</p>
