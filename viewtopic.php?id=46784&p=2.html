					<p>I&#039;ve followed the guide on the wiki page to change the bootloader, and everything seems to go well until I&#039;ve finished flashing it on, and the device is dead <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />If I reflash with the original dumped image it springs back to life, so I haven&#039;t damaged the hardware!!<br />On further investigation I&#039;ve found that in the zip file for the bootloader linked from the wiki page, both of the binaries don&#039;t contain firmware, but some link data to the ftp site to get them. However the ftp site requires a username and password.<br />Does anyone have a working bootloader, or even a fully working device that they could share a flash image with me from?<br />I can&#039;t seem to get my serial port working for some reason, so a configured CFE that has an IP address would be appreciated, or an image with Openwrt installed.<br />Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I followed the guide, but I can&#039;t get a working route after flash and I would like some questions to experts.<br />First of all, the original image that I have extracted with flahsrom is 8388608 bytes long, in fact, when I try to write the&nbsp; lede-17.01.1-brcm63xx-smp-A4001N1-squashfs-cfe.bin, which is 8388864, I get an error message about rom size.<br />I&#039;ve dumped the rom and seen that at the end is full of 0xff, so I trimmed it in order to fit the required size.<br />After the flash, the router is completely dead, i Mean, no led lights on, including the one on the ethernet side when i plug the ethernet cable.<br />Is this the normal behaviour before load openwrt firmware ?<br />I don&#039;t get any answer pinging 192.168.2.50 (as written on the wiki).<br />I feel a little lost ...</p>									</div>
