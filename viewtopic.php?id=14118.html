					<p>Solved via MBM&#039;s&nbsp; &nbsp;thread: </p><br /><p>Oh .. right .. I suppose I should explain it better:</p><p>iptables -t nat -A prerouting_rule -d x.x.x.x -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to 10.0.0.2<br />iptables -A forwarding_rule -p tcp --dport 80 -d 10.0.0.2 -j ACCEPT<br />iptables -t nat -A postrouting_rule -s 10.0.0.0/24 -p tcp --dport 80 -d 10.0.0.2 -j MASQUERADE</p><p>x.x.x.x is my external IP address; I want it so when I connect to that IP address that it gets forwarded to my internal webserver which is 10.0.0.2. The problem is this:</p><p>request: 10.0.0.x (some random lan machine) -&gt; x.x.x.x (external ip) -&gt; 10.0.0.2 (websever)<br />response: 10.0.0.2 -&gt; 10.0.0.x</p><p>I&#039;ve connected to x.x.x.x but the response came from 10.0.0.2 .. oops. To correct this, a masquerade is done using the third rule. This has the unfortunate side effect of hiding the original source address, but it does correct the issue with the response. Since this only applies to machines on the lan subnet, I&#039;ve added a -s; this allows proper logging of requests from outside the lan.</p><br /><p>michael</p>									</div>
