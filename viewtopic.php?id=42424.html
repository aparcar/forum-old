					<p>Hello people from Openwrt Forum.</p><p>I know that the failsafe is important on openwrt firmwares and it helps a lot when we make something wrong that crash our routers. But in my case, I have a shared network and due the phisycal limitations, my router unfortunately stays on a central of my building. Of course, this is a place that anyone can access and the security is none ...<br />Well, I created already a personalized firmware for my router that blocks all lan ports that are not used and strong passwords to try become more reliable my network. But, anyone with an Linux and Openwrt knowledge can screw and erase all my data on the router by the failsafe option. Is there any way to &quot;eliminate&quot; the failsafe or block it?</p><p>I will do this on two models, both tp-link. The 1043ND and an 703N.</p><p>Best Regards</p>									</div>

					<p>hnyman, if I change the default value 2 (fs_failsafe_wait_timeout=2) for 0, the failsafe will have not time anymore to start. But I&#039;m with problem on the 30_failsafe_wait. Which lines of these files refers to the specific entrance of failsafe? Or should I comment out all the lines of the file?</p><p>nebbia88, maybe it could be an option <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p> <br /><p>Best Regards</p>									</div>

You can also just remove the entire file before building (preinit is supposed to be modular, afterall).</p><p>I think all of these files can be removed from your build: 10_indicate_failsafe&nbsp; 30_failsafe_wait&nbsp; 40_run_failsafe_hook&nbsp; 99_10_failsafe_login<br />The router still hangs if you press the button for failsafe on boot.&nbsp; That&#039;s not really a problem of course, since we just want to make it disabled, so I&#039;m there are probably still some failsafe guts somewhere.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>briankb</strong> on 27 Aug 2013, 04:07)</p>
