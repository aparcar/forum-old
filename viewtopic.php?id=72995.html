					<p>I&#039;m not sure what the OP is trying to do.&nbsp; If you have a router running a certain firmware and want to clone that firmware onto another router of exactly the same model, you can make a binary copy of the &quot;firmware&quot; mtd partition and use it as a sysupgrade.</p>									</div>

I am still trying to find a tech contact to ask for the source. The fact that it is a build for the Broadcom 63138 is good cause it would add a new supported SoC/platform to the OpenWRT project!</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>mk24 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I&#039;m not sure what the OP is trying to do.&nbsp; If you have a router running a certain firmware and want to clone that firmware onto another router of exactly the same model, you can make a binary copy of the &quot;firmware&quot; mtd partition and use it as a sysupgrade.</p></blockquote></div><p>Since I bricked one of this Technicolor router already (shame on me), I&#039;d like to have a firmware image of the one I have now, image which I can flash via TFTP while the router is in bootloader mode (it uses dhcp to get ip and image name, reads it from pc tftp server and flash it, the images are in .rbi format)</p><p>So, I found this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.backup</code></pre></div><p>where a script makes dd images of the mtd partitions, but I believe this is not enough to create a flashable image with the tftp method.</p><p>Thanks you both for your answers!</p>									</div>
