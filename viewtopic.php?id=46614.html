					<p>Hi, I had bought a TP-LINK TL-WDR 3600. I would like to know if this router can be turned or configured into a repeater mode?<br />I had already searched that up and so far I could only see client bridge.</p><p>Is there a firmware flashing or some sort of modification do I need to turn this wireless router into a repeater?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>This question it too basic, you should seach first, the answer is already there.Anyway,</p><p>If it&#039;s version 1, you can download the stable AA version, firt flash factory, then flashsys upgrade.<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wdr3600-v1-squashfs-factory.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_a … actory.bin</a><br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wdr3600-v1-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_a … pgrade.bin</a></p><p>after changing the password, using the web gui interface to configure the router is quite easy.</p><p>1. make the lan different for avoidance of conflict with your repeated network, you can make it say 192.168.10.1<br />2 in wifi, click scan, and click join the network .you can make it simply as a repeater. </p><p>now it can do as a repeater. you can change other settings, like power,country,etc.</p>									</div>

					<p>Unlike the factory firmware, OpenWRT has wifi disabled by default on a fresh install.&nbsp; The wifi lights will not come on and no wifi signals will be emitted until you log in by Ethernet and configure it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 31 May 2015, 01:15)</p>

					<p>Hi deepak2980 what about the fermwair did you not like? If you want to run as a bridge or a repeater, you could give Gargoyle a try.<br /><a href="http://www.gargoyle-router.com/downloads/images/ar71xx/gargoyle_1.9.1-ar71xx-generic-tl-wdr3600-v1-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin">http://www.gargoyle-router.com/download … pgrade.bin</a><br />You can flash strate over the top of openwrt and it&#039;s very simple to set up.</p>									</div>
