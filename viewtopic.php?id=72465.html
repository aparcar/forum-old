					<p>Hello,</p><p>I built a little setup, with an OpenWRT Router (GL-AR150), a bluetooth low energy dongle and an bluetooth low energy node, which successful connects to the OpenWRT Router on the interface called bt0 and i also able to ping the bluetooth low energy node from my Pc, which is connected via a ethernet cable to the OpenWRT router. My problem is, that this connection always disconnects after 10-20 minuets and i have no idea why this happens. Does anybody have an idea if there is an mechanism inside the OpenWRT system that is responsible for this behavior and how to fix it?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Steff</p>									</div>

					<p>Unfortunately not. I already searched for any hints, with the dmesg command and also inside the logs...</p><p>I also compared the routes while the connection is working and after it fails, with <strong>route -A inet6</strong>, but I can see the address of the node before and after.</p><p>Any Ideas?</p><p>Best Regards<br />Steff</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>steffen.jahnke</strong> on 1 Nov 2017, 17:02)</p>
