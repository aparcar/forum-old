					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>I have a Netgear R8000. The original netgear firmware / web UI does not allow me to set R8000 as a wireless range extender. So I flashed R8000 netgear firmwear with the latest OpenWrt firmware.</p><p>The flash went OK. I can navigate the latest 15.05.1 LuCI. But I can&#039;t get the settings that work to achieve wireless repeating.</p><p>What I&#039;m trying do:</p><ul></ul><p>I have a Netgear D7800 wireless router broadcasting internet wirlessly.<br /></p><ul></ul><p>The reception is not good in my room.<br /></p><ul></ul><p>My sister gave me Netgear R8000 (she&#039;s not using it now).<br /></p><ul></ul><p>I want to put R8000 half-way between my room and my D7800.<br /></p><ul></ul><p>The idea is that R8000 works as a repeater. No ethernet cables are fed into the R8000. I want it to pick up the existing wifi signal from D7800, and repeat it (i.e. boost it).</p><p>Can someone please help me? I&#039;ve tried a few ways recomended from the internet. None of them have worked for me.</p><p>thanks very much for your help.</p><p>ian</p>									</div>
