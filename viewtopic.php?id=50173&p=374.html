					<p>@davidc502: would you be able to explain how to build for kernel version 4.4.x? 4.1.3 + the nand-patch doens&#039;t fix my boot issue, so once in a while my router needs an extra reset to boot again. Maybe 4.4 + patch will improve this issue?</p>									</div>

However, my 4.1.13 is rock solid, so let me know and I&#039;ll post a link to the image (includes luci).&nbsp; I recently built a image for Wizkid specifically for the ACS, and it&#039;s been reported to be rock solid as well.</p>									</div>

					<p>I went out of lazy mode, had a look around and figured it out in the meanwhile <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> building 4.4 as i&#039;m typing this.<br />I have a serial cable and jtag is underway (to fix an e4200 with a corrupt CFE), so if i break it, it should be able to fix it again <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />4.1.3 was stable for the first few builds for me, but eventually it failed to boot. I guess it is depending on HW quality and some timings.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>JohnnySL</strong> on 3 Jan 2016, 00:33)</p>
