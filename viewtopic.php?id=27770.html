					<p>Hi all.</p><p>As a frustrated new Linksys owner, I decided to give a try on better firmwares than those Linksys/Cisco provides. I found no references to this WAG120N device on the forums, but from the (crude) logs found on the device, I could easely notice this thing already runs a Linux kernel.</p><p>I also found on the Linksys support pages some open source files, which explained me a thing or two about this device.</p><p>Before I start to mess things around, I would love a word or two of advice. And no, I did not physically opened it yet, so no clue if it has or not a JTAG port. From the source files, I see this device has 4Mb serial flash, has a &quot;Amazon SE&quot; BSP version 1.3.1 and there are both firmware sources and u-boot source files available. It looks quite similar to WAG160N...</p><p>Anyway:</p><p>1. How can I restore this device in case it got bricked? Should the &quot;reboot+tftp+uploading a Linksys original firmware&quot; method be applied?</p><p>2. This device is a wireless router plus ADSL2+ modem, and I&#039;m unsure the ADSL2+ drivers are available on the Linksys source code. Still need to look at. Any tips for known drivers are welcome.</p><p>3. As said above, this device is a wireless router. I read somewhere (maybe over DD-WRT pages) it is advised to get some calibration data file before flashing custom/3rd party firmwares, and later use this file for proper wireless operation. As there is zero access to the device running the stock firmware, not sure how easy would be to extract this file.</p><p>I am going to play with backfire SVN files, any recommendations?</p><p>Is there anything else anyone can tell me about it?</p><p>Thanks for your time.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hquest</strong> on 19 Dec 2010, 04:30)</p>

					<p>There are two processors on this board: An Infineon PSB 50600 HL V1.2 (the Amazon SE BSP) and a RaLink RT3050F [s]switch[/s] 802.11bgn USB processor. There are also two EntronTech flash mems, EM638165TS-6G (8Mb) and EM63A165TS-6G (16Mb). The single antenna cable is, lol, ironed to the green PCB. There are two more antenna connectors, and an internal, PCB printed Antenna. I see no apparent JTAG serial port, however playing with a network sniffer, right after boot I see tons of unusual broadcasts, filled with data coming from the ethernet port. I guess I saw something about this anywhere.</p><p>Still, below is a picture of the internals, if anyone want to take a look at. Please note, I suck at taking pictures.</p><p><a href="http://img808.imageshack.us/i/dscn1308.jpg/"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://img808.imageshack.us/img808/1387/dscn1308.th.jpg" alt="http://img808.imageshack.us/img808/1387/dscn1308.th.jpg"/></span></a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hquest</strong> on 20 Dec 2010, 01:58)</p>

					<p>I love taking photos. And I don&#039;t find clear photos of the router. So i opened mine and take 2 good (i think) photos.

Is it possible to extract it from the router via telnet or something like that? (i guess it&#039;s not)</p>									</div>
