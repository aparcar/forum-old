					<p>The problem is, as Eric Raymond says, most people incorrectly think of software as something that comes in a box.&nbsp; Most companies all the way up to IBM who are successful in the software biz, sell their service and support, not the CD in a box.&nbsp; I make money customizing and supporting solutions, not hidden lines of code. </p><p>To put it in cooking terms, I like watching Emeril sometimes.&nbsp; One show he went over how to make his &quot;Essence&quot; spice like it was no big deal. It doesn&#039;t mean people don&#039;t still buy Emeril&#039;s Essence in a bottle on the grocery shelf, I still do.&nbsp; Keeping secret recipes is the mark of an insecure cook IMHO.</p><p>There are plenty of workable models for open-source software.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think that James Ewing actually had such a terrible idea of a paid subscription for a support forum. The problem came when he started attempting to assert control of the code itself, the MAC-locking junk is one symptom of that cancer.&nbsp; Things began to deteriorate rapidly after that.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 21 Mar 2006, 00:26)</p>
