					<p>Four years later, this post is still valid, but way miss spelled or incomplete, rendering it useless! But don&#039;t faint, there is still faith, you may be able to recover it without serial port!</p><p>Here is what I did:<br />I have had this router a long time, but I haven&#039;t flashed it with a custom firmware until some days ago. I tried to flash OpenWRT last version available for this hardware, openwrt-ar71xx-generic-wrt160nl-squashfs-factory.bin, and I bricked it!</p><p>Based on the previous post, I tried this on my Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64 bits:<br />1) Install tftp client:<br />sudo apt-get install tftp<br />2) I downloaded DD-WRT&#039;s firmware for this hardware from <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/site/support/router-database,">http://www.dd-wrt.com/site/support/router-database,</a> search for WRT160NL and you can download &quot;WRT160NL v1 Firmware - Webflash image for first installation&quot; (linksys-to-ddwrt-firmware.bin). I guess OpenWRT version or the original one (get it from <a href="http://support.linksys.com/en-us/support/routers/WRT160NL)">http://support.linksys.com/en-us/suppor â€¦ /WRT160NL)</a> should also work - not tested<br />2) I disabled my wifi interface, and manually configured eth0 to IP 192.168.1.2 and mask 255.255.255.0, no gateway or DNS needed, so forget it.<br />3) Connect eth0 to router&#039;s 4th LAN port<br />4) Open a terminal and go the folder where you downloaded the firmware. In my case,<br />cd ~/Downloads<br />5) Write the following command, but DON&#039;T press enter:<br />6) tftp 192.168.1.1 69<br />7) Power on the router, and after some seconds (when ubuntu detects network link) press enter to run the command.<br />8) set it to binary mode writing:<br />binary<br />9) send the downloaded firmware, in my case DD-WRT&#039;s linksys-to-ddwrt-firmware.bin:<br />put linksys-to-ddwrt-firmware.bin<br />10) When it is done, exit tftp client:<br />quit<br />11) After some seconds, ping default ip address, and you should have brought it to live!!<br />ping 192.168.1.1<br />Now you can set your IP address to DHCP, configure the router, or whatever.</p><p>Credits to fishball: I wouldn&#039;t have been able to do this without your help!</p>									</div>
