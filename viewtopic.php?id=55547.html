					<p>Hi, i&#039;m using an archer c7 v1 with openwrt trunk.<br />I know that in v1 5gh wifi is not supported... but i don&#039;t know if the external antennas, normally used for 5gh, are used by openwrt for the 2.4 band.<br />Is this possible?<br />If not... the external antennas are totally unusefull? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /> Can i remove it? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /><br />Tnx for your help<br />Deus3X</p>									</div>

					<p>the external antennas are not connected to the 2.4 GHz chip, so no, not used. I suppose you could open it up and modify things to configure which antenna goes to which band.</p>									</div>

					<p>I would remove the soldered internal antennas. You should also check that the external antenna you are using is designed for 2.4GHz operation. Not sure what TP-Link includes.</p>									</div>
