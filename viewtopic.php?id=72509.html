					<p>I already have a router in my home network so I wanted to enable the dumb AP option in my openwrt installed router, I disabled dhcp, assigned ip as 192.168.1.4 and also disabled firewall from startup scripts. But now I can access only the main router via default gateway and I can&#039;t access the openwrt installed router via the ip I gave earlier.<br />What is the issue here?<br />Edit :I can access internet fine from my openwrt wifi, but I just can&#039;t access the openwrt router&#039;s LuCi interface. If I try to access the default gateway it takes me to my main router&#039;s configuration page.</p><p>Edit 2: the ipconfig command shows two values for the default gateway 192.168.1.4(assigned to openwrt) and 192.168.31.1, I can only accept the latter which takes me to the main router page.</p><p>Also the weird thing I noticed is the main router config page which gets opened has the uri 192.168.31.1/cgi-bin/luci/web.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sapneshnaik</strong> on 7 Nov 2017, 20:27)</p>

					<p>i&#039;m just guessing your pc is having an address in the 192.168.31.x subnet and if it isnt a typo your new router is at 192.168.1.4 when it should have been 192.168.31.4.&nbsp; assign a static ip of 192.168.1.33 (or whatever) to your pc then you can fix your new one, most likely.</p>									</div>
