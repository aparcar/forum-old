					<p>Hi,<br />I recently purchased an ath9k supported card, and installed it on my WL-500w.<br />The wl500w is a broadcom SOC, so I need to select Broadcom BCM947xx as my target.&nbsp; However, when I do that the ath9k driver doesn&#039;t appear under menuconfig/kernel-modules/wireless-drivers.&nbsp; The ath9k driver DOES show up when I select the Atheros AR71xx platform, but I don&#039;t think an image compiled under that target would work on my router.<br />How can I make the Ath9k driver appear under the Broadcom target?</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>

					<p>Ah ha!<br />I had to modify the Broadcom BCM947xx target&#039;s makefile to specify kernel 2.6.28.&nbsp; Not the ath9k driver shows, but I&#039;m having a different issue - I&#039;m sure related to running the newer kernel.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not sure how much it matters, but I also suggest you revise the root .config file to indicate 28 instead of 27.</p>									</div>

					<p>It auto updated when I selected the bcm947xx target.</p><p>I think the hang at diag.c I&#039;m getting now is related to it detecting a wl500w, and trying to init it&#039;s wifi with drivers that don&#039;t exist.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to have a look at that tonight to see if I can make it boot happily.</p><p>Strangely, this current problem doesn&#039;t happen on the 8.09 build, but it also doesn&#039;t recognize the ath9k.</p>									</div>
