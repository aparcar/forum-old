					<p>In the unmodified linksys WRT54G, you can go to some screen and figure out the MAC Addresses of the computers connected to you.&nbsp; Does that exist in OpenWRT?&nbsp; I know ifconfig will get me MY mac address, is there some command like that to give you the Mac Addresses of the connected computers?</p>									</div>

					<p>yeah, I knew about the assoclist, but I needed the mac address of the gateway for the wan port.&nbsp; I have to lock my clients onto the first thing they plug this into.&nbsp; Assoclist would probably work for most people though.</p><p>Dev, gimme today to organize my thoughts and I will post what I do go to the gateway mac.&nbsp; Most people probably will not need to lock their clients into one gateway though so this may not be what you need.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well here, eventually I will probably put this up on some mini-howto somewhere but here is a summary for you now.</p><p>first, let me just say that I use scripts to do things like find the IPs and gateways.&nbsp; So I am going to post these scripts for reference.&nbsp; It is easier for me to remember /usr/bin/whatismygw than all that grepping(sp?) and such<br />whatismygw looks like this<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

netstat -rn | grep UG|tail -1 | awk &#039;{print $2}&#039;</code></pre></div><p>whatismygwmac looks like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

arping -fq -I vlan1 `whatismygwpptp`

cat /proc/net/arp | grep `whatismygwpptp` | awk &#039;{print $4}&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Ok, little explanation,</p><p>On the GW one.&nbsp; I need a way to easily find my gateway.&nbsp; So I use the netstat -rn command to list my routes and I grab the one where the flag is UG (U = useable or active; G = gateway).&nbsp; I actually use this little one line script to find my gateway in a lot of my other scripts, which is why I wrote something to easily reference it.</p><p>As for the whatismygwmac script.&nbsp; I use arping to get the MAC address in the arp tables.&nbsp; For those who don&#039;t know a whole lot about arping (I don&#039;t either), let me break down what I am doing there for you.&nbsp; arping -fq -I vlan1 `whatismygw`.&nbsp; -f means stop after the first response (I only need to ping once to get the mac address).&nbsp; -q means stfu, so no extra info is put in variables if I set them like so<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mymacgw=`whatismygwmac`</code></pre></div><p>otherwise, the response from the script would be:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>arping: connect<br />{my mac address}</p></blockquote></div><p>which has one line too much information.&nbsp; I just assume arping connected so I don&#039;t care about the response.&nbsp; Continuing on, -I tells you what interface to use.&nbsp; In my case, I am trying to get the MAC address of my router&#039;s gateway, so I use vlan1 (my wan port).&nbsp; If you are trying to do this to something on the inside, you would have to modify it accordingly.&nbsp; A note about the -I tag, you don&#039;t have to use it.&nbsp; If for some reason, you don&#039;t know what interface you are looking for you can set it like </p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>arping -fq -c 1 `whatismygw`</p></blockquote></div><p>The &quot;-c 1&quot; means that it only would try on each interface once before it moved on (count = 1).&nbsp; I really do not recommend this way of doing things as you then have to put a pause in your script to allow the arping to make it through all the interfaces.&nbsp; The script may look something like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

arping -fq -c 1 `whatismygw`

sleep {# of seconds needed}

cat /proc/net/arp | grep `whatismygw` | awk &#039;{print $4}&#039;</code></pre></div><p>You will probably have to pause at least 5 seconds to let arping scan all interfaces.</p><p>Finally you would replace `whatismygw` with whatever IP you are trying to find the MAC address for.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>PLEASE NOTE</p><p>I am not very good at any for of scripting.&nbsp; So there is a good chance that there is a better way to do this.&nbsp; Also, any script I posted after &quot;Ok, little explanation,&quot; is just theorectical.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t test it before I posted it so there is a chance it won&#039;t work if you just copy paste.&nbsp; You may have to tweak a little bit to fix my mistakes.</p><p>I do know that the first two snippets of code I posted are good because I pasted them right out of my shell.</p></blockquote></div><p>Lemme know if you have any questions.&nbsp; May be better off to PM or email me, because I check stuff sporatically.</p><p>Sorry about any spelling errors.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>t0ksik</strong> on 23 Nov 2005, 18:23)</p>
