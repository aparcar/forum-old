					<p>I have set up a guest network as per the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan">wiki&#039;s instructions</a>. The layout is as follows:<br />- WNDR3700 v2 acting as a router (no wireless)<br />- WNDR3700 acting as a wireless AP/switch</p><p>I configured a guest WLAN on the WNDR3700. My clients see it. I set up the necessary rules for the guest interface on the WNDR3700 v2 as well (all the entries in the firewall/network/dhcp config), but DHCP is not working. When I check /var/etc/dnsmasq I see only the 10.0.0.x network, but not the 10.0.1.x guest network stuff, despite it being enabled in /etc/config/dhcp. I have disabled dnsmasq and the firewall on the WNDR3700.</p><p>Contents of /etc/config/dhcp:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;dhcp&#039; &#039;lan&#039;
    option &#039;interface&#039; &#039;lan&#039;
    option &#039;start&#039; &#039;3&#039;
    option &#039;limit&#039; &#039;14&#039;
    option &#039;leasetime&#039; &#039;12h&#039;
    
config &#039;dhcp&#039; &#039;guest&#039;
    option &#039;interface&#039; &#039;guest&#039;
    option &#039;start&#039; &#039;3&#039;
    option &#039;limit&#039; &#039;20&#039;
    option &#039;leasetime&#039; &#039;12h&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Do I have to enable the firewall on the switch (and set up some kind of forwarding?). I&#039;m getting the feeling the communication between the AP and the router is where it goes wrong. How can I check this?</p><p>For the record: the regular wireless APs on the WNDR3700 work just fine, and they get their IP from the WNDR3700 v2 like they should. It&#039;s just the guest AP that isn&#039;t handing out DHCP leases.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Borromini</strong> on 28 Apr 2013, 12:25)</p>

					<p>You do need the firewall to seperate the guest network from the main network.<br />You can work with vlans to keep the access point as dumb as possible. and keep the firewall stuff on the first router.</p><p>Does the first router also have devices connected to it?</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, it does. I have configured the firewall on the router to isolate the guest WLAN.</p><p>I had the firewall going on the AP as well before but it didn&#039;t seem to make any difference. Clients on the guest WLAN didn&#039;t get an IP address either.</p><p>Maybe the issue is with this section in the howto:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;zone&#039; 
  option &#039;name&#039; &#039;guest&#039;
  option &#039;input&#039; &#039;REJECT&#039;
  option &#039;forward&#039; &#039;REJECT&#039;
  option &#039;output&#039; &#039;ACCEPT&#039;</code></pre></div><p>The funny thing is, the thread that is linked to at the top of that very same wiki entry specifies &#039;input&#039; should be ACCEPT and not reject. Stuff I&#039;m finding concerning setting up guest WLANs seem to contradict one another on that point.</p>									</div>

					<p>the issue is that you use two routers, i have one router configured with wlan and wlan-guest and it works flawlessly. I have got a seccond router that also has the guest wlan, but it uses a vlan to isolate it from the rest of the network.</p><p>In your case most of the tutorial applies, but not all. because the wan zone in this case is on the first router.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>FriedZombie</strong> on 30 Apr 2013, 00:14)</p>

					<p>FriedZombie, it&#039;s a bit overdue, but thank you for the hints.</p><p>Today I set up a separate VLAN on both the router and AP for the guest network and now it works <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p><p>Since more people have difficulty setting it up I will be adding the instructions to the wiki.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Borromini</strong> on 5 Apr 2015, 20:57)</p>
