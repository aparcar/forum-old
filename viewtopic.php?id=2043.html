					<p>Hello,</p><p>I want to build a streaming mp3 server on the WRT. Icecast (the server; <a href="http://www.icecast.org/download.php)">http://www.icecast.org/download.php)</a><br />is available as source code and the client ices (sending mp3s or oggs to the server; <a href="http://www.icecast.org/ices.php)">http://www.icecast.org/ices.php)</a> too.<br />The mp3s could get the WRT from a SMB-Share.</p><p>It&#039;s possible to build packages? Does the router (my: WRT54G 2.2) have enough power?</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Raymond</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>raymond</strong> on 19 Jul 2005, 00:47)</p>

					<p>PeerCast package is done!</p><p>Description: P2P audio and video streaming server<br /> PeerCast is a fresh new P2P streaming server. It can stream music<br /> and video from a broad variety of formats.<br /> .<br /> Many audio players can listen to peercast streams, as it&#039;s<br /> been built to remain compatible with Nullsoft Shoutcast.<br /> For more info, visit <a href="http://www.peercast.org">http://www.peercast.org</a>.</p><p>With peercast you can stream video and audio, as well as relay peercast streams to all your local network from one single source!<br />All you have to do is setup a peercast on the router, and then get all the other local clients to listen to this source!</p><p>You can also stream to internet with a local network source etc..<br />Peercast accepts ices clients as well as many others.</p><br /><p>The package is located at:<br /><a href="http://www.cti.ecp.fr/~beauxir5/peercast">http://www.cti.ecp.fr/~beauxir5/peercast</a><br />it depends on libpthread and uclibc++ that you may find there also.<br />All you have to do is ipkg install it and then run /etc/init.d/S60peercast<br />You can access the server at: http://yourrouterip:7144/<br />The first password is hackme, you should change it asap <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I&#039;ll be happy to have feedbacks, my email is: toots &lt; at &gt; rastageeks &lt; dot &gt; org</p><br /><p>Romain</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>toots</strong> on 27 Sep 2005, 15:29)</p>

					<p>Did anybody managed to crosscompile ices ? or some alternative - light weight source client that would run on the same device and ogg/mp3 to peercast ?</p><p>Le Jeudi 23 Mars 2006 00:23, Romain Beauxis a écrit :&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&gt; Could you try with the new package I just made from last peercast release?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&gt; You can find it at this place:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&gt; <a href="http://perso.ecp.fr/~beauxir5/peercast/peercast_0.1217-1_mipsel.ipk">http://perso.ecp.fr/~beauxir5/peercast/ … mipsel.ipk</a> <br />i did not try this yet, since i made loads of modifications to my &quot;old&quot; peercast. <br />i would be interested if somebody found a way how to display list of available streams to normal users, not only via admin interface.<br />Also i suggest to take out meta refresh tags from peercast html by default.<br />Another issue is automatic appending .pls extension and renaming mounpoint to something like :<br />F369AA4034AB9FFF417A56926B91F3E8.pls<br />you cannot play this in xmms.<br />what i really like is automatic renaming of ogg video to &quot;OGM&quot;. this should become standard.<br />Peercast works nice !</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes , I think is the new proposal , ICECAST WITH THEORA SUPPORT IN THE PACKAGES ?</p><p>This would be totally usable : <br />openwrt routers can act as server well. <br />with ices can act as clients reasonably well with precodified files (forget about icecast and ices , use 2 routers for this)</p><p>forget about make ices encode inside the router<br />forget as live inputs inside the router (via usb devices , really not true , but this need encode , virtually discarder. ) </p><p>But only the server passing video .... I think is reasonable , and not so difficult , we are talking to change source code from 1 package and test.</p><p>I haven&#039;t the knowledge to crosscompile (this is the needed for the testing , not ?) , never do , but if someone can point me I can work in this.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Maniman</strong> on 12 Oct 2015, 17:25)</p>
