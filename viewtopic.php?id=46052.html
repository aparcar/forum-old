					<p>I am trying to learn how to use Openwrt through the web GUI of my TP Link 1043 ND (Attitude Adjustment) and I am having difficulty of understanding where to enter commands for scripts such as qos, netem etc. I recently managed to learn that the qos script commands are entered at the local startup command interface but I am still having difficulty turning them on like for e.g. I would restart the script then the router not knowing which one will actually enable the script. As for netem, I installed the kmod netem packaged via Opkg and do not know where to enter commands to initiate netem since it is not an initscript.</p>									</div>
