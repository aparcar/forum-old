					<p>I think it will not realy supported by Openwrt.<br />I have experimented a lot, but i fail.<br />I was trying to use JFFS see <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=52133">here</a> but i fail too.</p><p>In the other hand squashfs is read only and it is not usefull.<br />(the ext4 image from trunk is in the moment readonly. If you like to see what problems are available. <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=65359">fix is here</a>)</p><p>More Interesting are a combined squashfs/jffs image like a routerimage.<br />But I think, the best will be a ramdisk.<br />A ramdisk is general possible, but i have no idea how can i unpack and pack the kernel.img<br />and how is it possible to implement this in the ImageBuilder.</p>									</div>
