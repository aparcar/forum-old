					<p>That&#039;s odd. I haven&#039;t built for the WNDR3700 from Backfire, I&#039;ve always built from trunk (I believe most WNDR3700 users are using trunk builds).</p><p>Did you follow the steps in the wiki entry?

					<p>5GHz on stock firmware works fine?</p><p>I would suggest giving <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27722">arokh&#039;s WNDR3700 builds</a> a try, his builds work really well and include pretty much everything most people would want.

					<p>So after trying stock and arokh&#039;s build by flashing with tftp. The 5ghz led which didn&#039;t show, now comes on, but although the firmwares say it&#039;s outputting 5ghz, I can&#039;t detect it. I have made sure my laptop can connect to a 5ghz network (with another router).</p><p>I also have a new problem where the router reboots itself every 5 mins. on both stock and arokh&#039;s build.</p><p>What should I do?</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I tried the stock .68 build, because the wireless has worked on it before in the past. </p><p>As for the wireless channel, I made sure to use a channel I can connect to as I did on another router that can output 5ghz.</p><p>I&#039;ll try to contact Netgear when I have some time and find out if it&#039;s still covered under warranty if it turns out to be a hardware issue.</p><p>Feel free to post anything else that can help.
