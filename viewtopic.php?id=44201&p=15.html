And would I be able to install luci through it since there is no telnet/ssh daemon installed as you thankfully explained or are we talking about a different way installing luci/openwrt?</p>									</div>

I did more testing last night I can&#039;t get the WDS link to use 40mhz channels, nor can I get it to link at more than MCS0 on 20mhz despite the signal looking good.</p><p>Also last night with my laptop I couldn&#039;t get more than 4mbit over wireless on the C7. Turned off WDS for more testing and speeds didn&#039;t improve. I&#039;m ready to give up on the C7 for now and wait for drivers/hardware to mature a bit more. I even switched back to my plain old wireless N card in my laptop to rule out Intel AC card.</p>									</div>
