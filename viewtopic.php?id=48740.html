					<p>Hi everyone<br />I&#039;ve compiled openwrt for bt home hub 2.0 type B, r34686.<br />During the procedure to install it I need to use netconsole (nc) to make my rooter load openwrt. <br />I installed it without problem but when I reboot my router it doesn&#039;t work. It has a slow flashing orange led, wich means it is not loading. But if I run netconsole in my computer the the orange led starts to flash faster and finally it turns to blue and the router works.<br />If i don&#039;t use netconsole the led remains flashing slowly. </p><p>And I now this revision is compatible with my router model. </p><p>Could you please help me?</p><p>I don&#039;t know why netconsole affects the booting process because I only run it, but I don&#039;t press any button. </p><p>Thank you</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Reflected_God</strong> on 3 Feb 2014, 01:47)</p>

					<p>This is a uboot settings issue.</p><p>Booting problems without LAN. These seem to be solved by using:<br />fw_setenv preboot &quot;setenv stdin nc; setenv stdout serial; setenv stderr serial&quot;</p><p>The default for stdout is nc. When you boot without lan, nc waits forever.</p><p>This means you won&#039;t see boot logs via nc, but CAN interrupt the boot process by running nc and hitting a key. You can then type &#039;setenv stdout nc&#039; to get a prompt.</p><p>This hardware is now somewhat dated.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dmcdonnell</strong> on 1 Feb 2014, 15:29)</p>
