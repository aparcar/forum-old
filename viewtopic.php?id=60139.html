					<p>Hello, I have a TP-Link TL-WR842N/ND v2 with OpenWRT version &quot;OpenWrt Barrier Breaker 14.07 / LuCI Trunk (0.12+svn-r10530)&quot; installed on it.&nbsp; It has been setup as a repeater (&quot;Routed Client with relayd (Pseudobridge)&quot;, as described in the wiki here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient</a> ).&nbsp; The configuration files are identical (with the exception of ESSIDs) to those described in the wiki.</p><p>My issue is that when the repeated network goes down, the access point also goes down.&nbsp; I am in a situation where the repeated network is sporadically available (buggy Verizon MiFi device that cannot be fixed with a software update or hardware replacement) but I still want the home network to be accessible over WiFi.&nbsp; Is there any way configure the router so that the Access Point will stay up even if the repeated network goes down?</p>									</div>

					<p>Your problem is not solvable if you only use 1 radio. Your solution is to have 2 radios - one for AP other one for the incoming internet connection, that way AP can stay up even if the second radio becomes unavailable. The easiest solution of implementing this is to plug in USB wifi adapter into your router. You might get one with RP-SMA for stronger signal.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the quick response.&nbsp; I would really like to save my USB port for other devices, so if there is a more advanced way of doing this I would be happy to delve into it.</p><p>It looks like someone was trying to solve a similar problem in the following thread but was unsuccessful <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=28242">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=28242</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Why not just get a cheap little travel router set up as a client and connect it via ethernet to the WAN port of your TP?&nbsp; They only cost $20-25.&nbsp; The hootoo or gl-inet 6416 could be good options.</p>									</div>
