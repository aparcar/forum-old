					<p>Not exactly: the &quot;off/on/reset procedure&quot; will revert to the <strong>previous</strong> firmware. If you install David&#039;s build on top of the stock firmware, then the &quot;off/on/reset procedure&quot; will revert back to it. But if you install one version of David&#039;s build on top of another, then you will only go back to the previous version.</p>									</div>

Seems like my router will keep settings instead of erasing them when loading a new firmware when reverting back with off on toggle reset.</p><p>Have been testing the latest acs V1 firmware on my ac v2... and doing well with it. In fact it is better than the latest AC V2 firmware that I installed soon after setting up the new ac v2. </p><p>A bit of info about these routers... Seems like peeps have been complaining about their router being slow on 2.4ghz band. Found out it is an internal corruption of the config file.</p><p>If you have a good config saved, you can reset to defualts and restore the previous firmware. Once done after its initial setup, you can load the latest firmware of choice and finish up with loading your config after it reboots.</p><p>Cleaned up a lock on slow 2.4ghz band when i started messing around with various settings in wifi on the latest firmware the model. Didn&#039;t realise it until after I did the acs V1 firmware, and had to roll everything back. No sweat, with the issue, once I cleared the router out and made sure all builds of firmware were clean before I applied my settings.</p><p>Both AC V1 and ACS V1 have the same menus right down to the hidden advanced features menu. Just it seems that ACS V1 interface runs smoother on the AC V2 router.</p>									</div>
