					<p>I am using a filter string to catch only the probe-request frames from my wifi router working in monitor/Promisc mode.</p><p>the same string i.e. &quot;type mgt subtype probe-req&quot; is working when i am running my code on a laptop but on my linksys WRT54g its giving error that</p><p>cannot pcap_compile() function is not working.</p><p>To be more explanatory, I am using OpenWRT White Russian 0.9 firmware on my router and its equivalent SDK to build package for it. The program uses Libpcap library to capture raw packets from the network.</p><p>So I want to know that is there any change in the string format while working on embedded devices like a router. If yes can you suggest me where I can find the documentation for it. If no that what&#039;s wrong I am doing.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>patiyal.manish</strong> on 7 Mar 2014, 09:01)</p>
