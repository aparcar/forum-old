					<p>Hi,</p><p>There are 3 of us living in an apartment together with a 7meg down and 640k up dsl connection.&nbsp; We want to split the download speed and upload speed between the 3 of us equally so if one person is downloading another can game online without any lag.&nbsp; I know i could do it if i got an old pc and used it as a router with pfsense on it but is it possible to just do it with my wrt54g and openwrt?</p>									</div>

					<p>7m/512k even split in 3 equal speed parts doesn&#039;t allow to download at full speed on first part for example and playing online with low latency on others parts<br />There is a method called QoS (Quality of Service), for my opinion, it isn&#039;t perfect because it &quot;prioritize&quot; data packets, but test it<br />Just use qos-scripts and read topics about qos and settings ...</p>									</div>

					<p>Is QoS really the best way to ensure lag free gaming?&nbsp; A few years ago i lived with a few guys and we had 3meg up and 3 meg down and we used pf on an openbsd box to split the connection evenly whenever one of us was gaming which worked fine</p>									</div>
