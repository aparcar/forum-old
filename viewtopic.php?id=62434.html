					<p>Hello, </p><p>My goal is to disable leds blinking on TP-Link WR841n v10 (Atheros QCA9533-BL3A), which is caused by U-boot, while system boots, I have manage to do it on Pope2k uboot mod for 740N (with his help), but unfortunately it do not support 9533<br />I google around 2h to find a guide how to compile u-boot, and so for do not find any. Then I downloaded TP-LINK GPL sources and start trying but without success (I suspect they mess up with them somehow)<br />Can someone point me at the right direction? I just want to download, and compile it, and of course to comment the line responsible for led blinking (all_leds_on) as long as I remember <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nedoskiv</strong> on 28 Jan 2016, 16:41)</p>

					<p>Are you sure its worth risking to permanently brick your system ?<br />If you manage to compile uboot do not flash directly to u-boot partition before trying from RAM</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes I have to risk it, anyway I noticed there is uboot 1.1.4 in tp-link sources, that gives me hope for pepe2k uboot can work with it.</p>									</div>
