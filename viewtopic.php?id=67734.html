					<p>Hi all,</p><br /><p>I bought two routers with OpenWRT installed, and I want to test an ad-hoc wireless network. So my setup is like this:</p><p>PC1 &lt;---&gt; router1 &lt;------wireless channel------&gt; router2 &lt;---&gt;PC2</p><p>initially I want to setup a wireless ad-hoc connection between router1 and router2, and I want to do a link test between PC1 and PC2. For both router1 and router2, I setup a network called &quot;mesh&quot; for wlan0, and gave each &quot;mesh&quot; interface a static IP address (192.168.10.1 and 192.168.10.2). The LAN interfaces of each router run DHCP servers with IP addresses 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.2.1. So PC1 was assigned an IP addess 192.168.1.x and PC2 192.168.2.x. </p><p>So if I ssh to router1, I can ping 192.168.10.2, which is router2&#039;s&nbsp; mesh interface IP address. However I cannot ping 192.168.10.2, router2&#039;s LAN interface. Furthermore, from PC1, I can ping 192.168.10.1 which is router1&#039;s mesh interface IP address, but not 192.168.10.2. The reverse is also true for both cases. </p><p>So what do I need to do to connect everything up? </p><br /><p>thanks,<br />Aaron</p>									</div>

					<p>I managed to get it working by modifying the &quot;mesh&quot; interface on each router and changing the default gateway to the other router&#039;s mesh IP address. I also disabled all of the firewall settings for all interfaces. So the IP address of the mesh interface for router1 was 192.168.10.1, and the default gateway was 192.168.10.2 and vice-versa. I think I also changed the default gateway of the LAN interface to equal to the mesh interface IP address, but I would need to re-setup everything to verify it. i.e. for router1, I think the LAN interface default gateway was 192.168.10.1.</p><p>regards,<br />Aaron</p>									</div>

					<p>PC1 &lt;---&gt; (eth0 )router1 (wlan0)&lt;------wireless channel------&gt;(wlan0) router2 (eth0)&lt;---&gt;PC2<br />now, I put eth0 and wlan0 in the same bridge , and bridge&#039;s ip is 192.168.1.1 . At the same time, router2&nbsp; bridge&#039;s ip is 192.168.1.2 . And then pc1 is 192.168.1.10 , pc2 is 192.168.1.20. But these two PCs alse can&#039;t ping directly.</p>									</div>

					<p>Your setup is different from mine. I have router1, eth0 running a DHCP server at 192.168.1.1 and router2 eth0 running a DHCP server at 192.168.2.1. I created an interface called mesh which WLAN0 is attached to for both routers. I don&#039;t have any bridge setup. All firewalls disabled, all netmasks 255.255.255.0. I&#039;m not saying that this is a good setup, only that it works for my purposes.</p><p>PC1(dynamic192.168.1.141,DHCPClient) &lt;--&gt; eth0(LAN interface)(static192.168.1.1,DHCPserver,gateway192.168.20.1) &lt;--&gt; wlan0(mesh interface)(static192.168.20.1,gateway192.168.20.2) &lt;-----------wireless channel-----------&gt; <br />wlan0(mesh interface)(static192.168.20.2,gateway192.168.20.1) &lt;--&gt; eth0(LAN interface)(192.168.2.1,DHCPserver,gateway192.168.20.1) &lt;--&gt; PC2(192.168.2.238,DHCPClient)</p><p>regards,<br />Aaron</p>									</div>
