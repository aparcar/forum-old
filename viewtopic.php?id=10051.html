					<p>I have a 54G that I upgraded from stock to OpenWRT.&nbsp; Upon reboot, everything came up roses, except - no Internet access.&nbsp; I was getting a DHCP address, but according to the routing table on the 54G, no default route.&nbsp; If I manually switch over to static IP, and then do &#039;save changes&#039; then &#039;apply changes&#039;, the default route appears and saves, and all is good.</p><p>Known issue?&nbsp; bonehead move on my part?</p>									</div>
