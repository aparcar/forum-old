					<p>Hi, I am new to this with some windows experience and close to zero Linux experience.</p><p>I ve have wrt54GL, with openWRT white russian and x-Wrt on it. I have forwarded some ports to local IP addreses. Right now I can connect to any PC in LAN from within LAN by using local IP adress and port combination. Let say to 192.168.1.39:2001. I then tried to connect from work to my external IP address and port 2001. Since this one is forwarded to local IP ....39 I was able to successfully connect to the same PC. When I got back home again and tried to use same external IP to connect to same PC it did not work... This drives me crazy, since I do not want to change IP address everytime I need to use PC outside of LAN or within LAN.</p><p>It did work fine with original linksys OS on the router, so I hope this is possible to do on openWrt as well. Any ideas?</p>									</div>
