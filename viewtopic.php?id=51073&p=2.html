Looking at the stock driver at <a href="http://pastebin.com/QuD94xaN,">http://pastebin.com/QuD94xaN,</a> each defined port on the driver seems to be on the same phyBase of 0, which I am assuming is the MDIO interface. Now with that knowledge, we know the current GB port is on PHY 4, so that would map it to the &quot;port 5&quot; in the driver. Thing is, nothing shows up on any of the other PHY interfaces on MDIO 0. I tested this in u-boot using the &quot;mii info&quot; command.</p><p>I know other devices had similar issues, ex. D-Link DIR-632-A1, and they seemed to think there was a 2nd MDIO interface on the SOC as per <a href="http://patchwork.openwrt.org/patch/3641/,">http://patchwork.openwrt.org/patch/3641/,</a> but I guess that is not the case.</p><p>So ya, this is where I am stuck at this point.</p>									</div>

The 2nd port may be on a switch, similar to the wzr-hp-g300nh2 so I may mess around with that 2nd NIC again later today.</p>									</div>
