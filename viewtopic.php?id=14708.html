					<p>Dlink has released an emulator for their devices.&nbsp; Build it and test your flash of any wrt firmware against it.&nbsp; If it works, you should be able to use their libraries to build and flash your own bin packages if you know what you are doing.&nbsp; I&#039;d ask you to upload them somewhere, but that would be both presumptuous and a little selfish, not to mention putting you in a tight spot if somebody bricks a router.&nbsp; Uploading your revision number and the methods you used that worked might be useful, though.</p>									</div>
