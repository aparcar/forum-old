					<p>Hello. Please help me with two things:</p><p>1. Howto call `make&#039; to build kernel image after `make menuconfig_kernel&#039;? I want to build only kernel image, don&#039;t want to build all software.<br />2. In `make menuconfig&#039; I have put `*&#039; asterisk for wanted software. But it still produce ipk packages for selected software. I want squashfs/jffs2 image with build in software.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>As for question 2: Did you try the new image? As far as i know it&#039;s normal behavior. Extra software selected with (*) will be installed in the squashfs/jffs2 image, as well as an ipkg package.</p>									</div>
