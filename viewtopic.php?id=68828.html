					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have experienced following problem: kernel package for non-standard device driver added with =m option appeared in staging_dir and ipkg packages but not in an image. It&#039;s name was missing from linux.default.install file, processed by /package/Makefile for populating build_dir (direct image source). Modifying package-ipkg.mk BuildTarget/ipkg did the job, but is it a bug or a feature? Actually having LKM option for development is a must.</p><p>Regards</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s a little tricky to understand your description, but it seems that you&#039;re saying that a package added in menuconfig, selected as a module, is not added to the final image.</p><p>This is the correct behaviour. Anything added =m is built but not included in the image. If you add it with a =y then it will be added to the final image.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry for being imprecise, I&#039;m in firefighting mode right now.</p><p>My post above is showing the complexity of stuff I had to review to discover this feature.
