					<p>I&#039;m looking to get a very simple router for my parents and other very not computer savvy relatives. By simple I mean really bare bones simple - turn it on, set up a WiFi password, that&#039;s pretty much it. We don&#039;t need port forwarding,&nbsp; QoS settings, VPN, or anything else that only confuses naive users. I&#039;d even prefer these things not even be in the UI. And ... a way to check the status that&#039;s easy to tell whether things are working or something is screwed up. </p><p>Traditional consumer oriented routers seem to be moving in the opposite direction - cramming more functionality into a complex UI. I&#039;m thinking that perhaps OpenWrt has a solution for me. </p><p>Does anyone know of any custom firmware that would meet my needs? If not, how difficult would it be for me to take OpenWrt and modify the UI so that it does what I need? I&#039;m a very experienced software developer, so if it can be done I can probably figure out how. Any ideas?</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m solving this for my parents and relavitevs too, but myself. Basically you just set it up and never touch it again as long as they do not forget the passwod <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> For that cases I install n2n package and then I can manage all the routers remotely no matter where or how they are connected.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, that&#039;s the start of a good solution if you lock it down and no one touches it. But there are cases where touching it is beneficial. For instance, if there&#039;s an ISP problem your n2n strategy won&#039;t work. You need someone local to the router to diagnose the problem.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey there.</p><p>Don&#039;t get me wrong. I think if you really want something simple that can be used easily without lot knowledge, I&#039;m completely with you. You shoudn&#039;t need something fancy with included NAS and UPnP ans whatever. Just &quot;keep it simple, stupid&quot;, full ack.</p><p>But I don&#039;t get your point when it comes to &quot;touching is beneficial&quot;.</p><p>Ok, when you want to drop that at your parents house and they might want to do &quot;something&quot;, they are really need something very very simple. Mine do, too.<br />But your &quot;ISP issue&quot; example really is not an issue at all.</p><p>If there are any problems with that internet connection, then there are exactly three scenarios:<br /></p><ul><li><p>Let&#039;s reboot the router, that fixes it</p></li><li><p>Don&#039;t touch anything, an issue of somebody else gets solved by somebody else, and then the connection starts running again.</p></li><li><p>The router is demaged, replace it.</p></li></ul><p>But I don&#039;t see any situation where I might need to guide somebody through configuration in order to fix a problem that suddenly appeared. This just doesn&#039;t happen <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p><p>Again: Nothing against your demand. If you want something simple, then what you get should be simple. Period.</p><br /><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>									</div>

					<p>My point is very simple. You&#039;re right, once things are configured, hands off the configuration. Most people don&#039;t need to configure anything other than their WiFi password anyway.</p><p>But what about status/diagnosis? How many times do I hear my wife yell &quot;The internet doesn&#039;t work!&quot; At least a few times a year. In the past 10 years I&#039;ve seen:</p><ul><li><p>Power supply die</p></li><li><p>Network cable go bad</p></li><li><p>Networking switch die</p></li><li><p>... and the ever popular problem at the ISP</p></li></ul><p>Now I&#039;m savvy enough to go into my router and understand things well enough to figure out the problem fairly quickly. But most people can&#039;t do that because routers are designed by engineers FOR engineers. Go open up your router and look around and ask yourself how much of this stuff can be understood by average people who simply want to know &quot;Why doesn&#039;t the internet work?&quot;</p><p>Good example: How many places in your router show you a MAC address? Probably lots. A MAC address is a Layer 2 concept. Think about it: Why is a freakin&#039; Layer 2 concept being shown by applications to users?? Don&#039;t answer, I know why. But come on, 99% of the people are looking at that and thinking &quot;What&#039;s this gobbledygook?&quot;</p><p>So aside from hiding all of the complex configuration stuff that&#039;s not going to be used anyway, there should be a simple way to get status information that&#039;s meaningful to other 99%.</p>									</div>
