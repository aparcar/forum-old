					<p>Hello,</p><p>I was wondering if it&#039;s possible to merge my existing root directory with an sdcard.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@iobot-0012:/mnt/sdb1# df -h
Filesystem                Size      Used Available Use% Mounted on
rootfs                    1.3M    980.0K    364.0K  73% /
/dev/root                13.5M     13.5M         0 100% /rom
tmpfs                    30.1M    116.0K     30.0M   0% /tmp
/dev/mtdblock4            1.3M    980.0K    364.0K  73% /overlay

/dev/sda1                14.4G     36.9M     13.6G   0% /sdcard1</code></pre></div><p>So, I guess what I&#039;m asking for is to extend my rootfs directory with &quot;sdcard1&quot;. Is this possible or will I have to completely move rootfs onto the sd card?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>You can mount it anywhere you want, but to make it fully a part of rootfs I don&#039;t think so without using lvm you can&#039;t span disks.</p><p>but if for example you have a bunch of stuff in /home/blah you can certainly move the stuff to /sdcard1 then mount it under /home/blah</p>									</div>

You see, my main issue currently is where my packages are being installed, which happens to be in /dev/mtdblock4. It is rapidly running out of space. All these packages are installed during image building. So, I am not sure if I can have all these packages installed onto the sd card by default, during the image installation itself. </p><p>So, the alternate idea was to try to &quot;extend&quot; the already allocated space into the sdcard somehow. Seamlessly adding more space, which I guess is not possible.</p><p>By doing what you are suggesting, would it be possible to move all of /bin or all of /etc onto the sdcard, then mount it under the original /bin /etc path? </p><p>I have already tried the extroot method, but I run out of space while I am copying over root onto sdcard.</p>									</div>

					<p>yes, but you&#039;d still need any files required to boot to be left in /etc/ or /bin/ so i&#039;m not sure how much you&#039;d gain.&nbsp; It would be better to choose a mount point that isn&#039;t needed for booting.</p><p>its basically the same thing extroot is doing, the real root is used until the system boots and the drivers to access the external storage are in memory, then mount over the top of it and then install the additional packages you need.</p><p>Not sure how it is possible to run out of space on a 16gb sd card......</p>									</div>
