					<p>Hello, </p><p>For some reasons it would be really helpful for me to be able to use ead ( <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/ead">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/ead</a> ) to send some commands right after a reflashing.</p><p>Well, I tried and tried very hard, but there was no way to get it working... Is somebody here able to help me ?</p><p>If I understood well, the ead daemon broadcasts packets on some interface (or listens to it, in the opposite fashion) and waits for a dialog to be established between the router and the client.</p><p>Well this is all good in theory, except that in practive I could not get it to communicate; ead-client always returns without discovering the device. What is happening there ?</p><p>Here&#039;s what I tested:<br />- freshly recompiled ead server on the router ( ead -d eth0 -D test ) , waiting for input;<br />- freshly recompiled ead-client on my PC;<br />- the router is connected with a cable to my Linux PC, with static routing (12.10.1.1 -&gt; 12.10.1.2 for my PC)</p><p>No answer from the client, no signal from the server.</p><p>When both of them are on the same DHCP network via wifi, and ead is recompiled with debug enabled, the server &quot;catches&quot; something; I see this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# ead -d wlan0-1 -D test
sending response to packet type 1: 4 </code></pre></div><p>, when I run the client, which itself sees nothing on the network.</p><p>I also tried to switch: client on the box, server on the PC. No way, still do not discover themselves.</p><p>I of course disabled every single trace of a firewall <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Maybe if somebody could help me out there, I&#039;m quite lost ! Would be really helpful, not only to me I hope !</p>									</div>
