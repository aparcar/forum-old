					<p>I have recently installed OpenWRT (17.01.2) on both a WRT1900AC v1 and v2 and I do not have internet access - No IPv4 WAN address (see attached screen shot).&nbsp; Has anyone else come across this problem?</p><p>I encountered the same problem on DDWRT, but with DDWRT, you can resolve the problem on the v1 hardware by using older DDWRT firmware and the v2 version did not yet have a solution.</p><p>I have Comcast and made sure I have rebooted my modem before connected the WRT1900 and it does not work on either version, so I had to use an older router with DDWRT just to provide internet access in my home until I figure out what is going on.</p>									</div>
