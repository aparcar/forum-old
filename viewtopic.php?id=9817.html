					<p>I rather foolishly flashed kamikaze (9th Mar, 2.6 kernel) without checking the nvram defaults on this router (WRT54GS v1) so I have boot_wait turned off!&nbsp; I can reach failsafe mode, but then:</p><p>root@(none):~# /sbin/mount_root<br />Unlocking linux ...<br />Could not open mtd device: linux<br />jffs2 not ready yet; using ramdisk</p><p>root@(none):~# firstboot<br />Unlocking OpenWrt ...<br />Could not open mtd device: OpenWrt<br />Segmentation fault<br />(Then I have to reboot.)</p><p>This is the first time I&#039;ve managed to screw it up this badly without being able to tftp a new firmware so I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;m going to need to make a serial port for it.&nbsp; Is there a way to change the nvram variable from the failsafe environment?&nbsp; `Nvram set` does not work.</p><p>Sorry if I&#039;ve missed something really obvious.&nbsp; Next time I&#039;ll be more careful about boot_wait and development code <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />.</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s my understanding that the bootloader still uses the boot_wait variable even in kamikaze.&nbsp; If it does, I can tftp a known working firmware.&nbsp; I might have been a bit misleading by posting the two failed commands above but all I wanted to do was get back to a working copy rather than attempt to fix the current installation.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t seem to be bricked - I mean I can telnet to it, it&#039;ll respond to ping, it just won&#039;t boot into normal mode.</p><p>Incidentally, I can load a firmware from a local webserver and run:<br /># wget <a href="http://192.168.1.100/temp/whiterussian.bin">http://192.168.1.100/temp/whiterussian.bin</a><br /># dd bs=32 skip=1 if=whiterussian.bin of=whiterussian.trx<br /># mtd -e linux -r write whiterussian.trx linux</p><p>But I get the &#039;unable to use mtd device: linux&#039; error.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bunker</strong> on 11 Mar 2007, 04:28)</p>

					<p>Sorry to bump an old/solved thread, but I haven&#039;t checked the email I subscribed to this topic with for some time.&nbsp; Since someone else got the problem recently(ish) I&#039;ll clarify.&nbsp; All I did was move /dev/mntdblockX to /dev/mntdblock/X and /dev/mtdX to /dev/mtd/X, where X is a number from 0-4.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure this info is all incredibly irrelevant now though <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />.</p>									</div>
