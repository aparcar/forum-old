					<p>Anyone have it working using openwrt backfire in virtualbox ? On the host, I have a TL WN321G usb wifi adaptor which I passes it through to the guest OS ( openwrt ). I seem to be able to bring up the interface after loading kmod-usb-ohci ( don&#039;t seem to be able to get kmod-usb2/ehci to recognise the usb ). But when I make a connection to it from my host OS using a separent wifi, I can&#039;t connect to the AP. </p><p>Want to do some simulated/testing using openwrt on my notebook.</p>									</div>

					<p>5 months is a long time to wait for a reply, but I come bearing good news.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; I set up a ClearOS host with a OpenWrt guest using VMWare and USB wifi, and it is working perfectly.</p><p>Some details:<br />ClearOS Enterprise 5.2 as router &amp; file server.&nbsp; ClearOS is derived from Red Hat.<br />VMWare player 4.0.1<br />Backfire 10.03.1-rc6 running bridged AP mode in a VM<br />Rosewill RNX-EasyN1 USB wifi adapter (Ralink RT3070), passed through to VM</p><p>If you care for more info, see my blog @ <a href="http://macbruins.wordpress.com">http://macbruins.wordpress.com</a></p><p>I also tried a TP-Link TL-WN722N (Atheros AR9271).&nbsp; It worked fine until the VM was rebooted.&nbsp; If I re-booted the host and VM together, no problem.&nbsp; If I powered off VM, unplugged adapter and plugged it back in, and then powered on VM, no problem.&nbsp; But if I rebooted jus the VM, the adapter would stop working.</p><p>I couldn&#039;t get VirtualBox to work at all.&nbsp; OpenWrt couldn&#039;t download firmware to the TP-Link through VirtualBox&#039;s USB pass-through.&nbsp; OpenWrt could initialize the Rosewill adapter working though VirtualBox, but no device could connect.</p><p>William</p>									</div>
