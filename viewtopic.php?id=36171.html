					<p>Hi,</p><p>Does anyone know if its possible to power down/sleep an idle LAN port based on inactivity after a period of time? I have a powerline networking adapter (dlink) attached to one port of the router which extends my network to my home office and would like to power down/sleep that port so that the powerline adapter also sleeps (it detects no network traffic and has a power saving sleep mode). I&#039;m running a TPLINK WR1043ND router running OpenWrt Backfire 10.03.1. The same Powerline adapter would go into sleep mode on inactive with my older Comtrend router.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Stuart</p>									</div>
