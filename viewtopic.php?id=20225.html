					<p>Hello everybody. I have a Linksys WRT54GL router and I want to install Openwrt.</p><p>I have some questions:</p><p>1. Is better to install 2.4 kernel or 2.6? Why?</p><p>2. Is possible to erase the Luci interface? It is better to erase once installed or compile a image without Luci and then install Openwrt?</p><p>3. Is posible to priorize traffic? I want priorize high SSH and WEB, and priorize low eMule.</p><p>Thanks for all and regards.</p>									</div>

					<p>nas,</p><p>You are right! I have discovered those issues, too. Since I use most wired in my home, I have just checked now and then that the wireless works. But when I started to actually use it, the wireless just went away after some minutes, and I had to reboot :-(</p>									</div>

					<p>1) 2.4 by a landslide (unless you don&#039;t care about wireless)</p><p>2) Yes, you have to compile the whole thing, but i STRONGLY suggest you first install a pre-compiled image, then enable boot wait via <a href="http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs(2f)Hardware(2f)Linksys(2f)WRT54GL.html?highlight=(OpenWrtDocs/Hardware)#head-81785006ef4a5260e1b9904d8d8a9a0f84e90eb3">nvram parameters</a> so if you brick your router you can re-flash it with <a href="http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs(2f)Installing(2f)TFTP.html">TFTP</a><br />i suspect that the latest svn trunk is bugged, because i&#039;ve seen lately ppl in this forum (including myself) claiming that the images they make won&#039;t work in the router:</p><p><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=20263">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=20263</a><br /><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=20289">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=20289</a><br /><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=20273">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=20273</a><br />...</p><p>3)Yeah, the easy way is to install later qos-scripts package <a href="http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/MiniHowtos(2f)QoSHowto.html">http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/MiniHowtos(2f)QoSHowto.html</a><br />or you can do it yourself with tc, iptables and patience... </p><p>regars...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>exelsus</strong> on 13 May 2009, 00:39)</p>

					<p>Well, on WRT54g, 2.4 or 2.6, there are some dependency.</p><p>Wireless speed and reliability, 2.4 &gt; 2.6 on trunk &gt; 2.6 on 8.09 branch.<br />Qos-scripts is not selectable in 2.4 trunk(as I last check, only for 2.6).<br />nvram tools now also works for 2.6 on trunk, i am not sure if it has been ported back to 8.09 or not.</p><p>So up to now, 2.4 on 8.09 is my first choice. As you can see, things are moving to 2.6, some day when b43 turns out to be reliable enough for daily usage, then that&#039;s time to say byebye to 2.4, hopefully.</p>									</div>

					<p>It is just an enquiry on 2.6 kernel usage and Broadcom 43XX chipset to crack WEP and WPA encryption of wifi networks.</p><p>You know the aircrack team issued a new version aircrack-ng 1.0 rc3 a few weeks ago. I have an intention to run the aircrack-ng application on my wrt54gl to crack some WEP and WPA encription based wifi networks. The chipset what the wifi router contains is Broadcom BCM5352EKBP, which is exactly the Broadcom 4318-as 802.11 PHY.</p><p>To accomlish packet-injection to the network traffic I have to use additionally the b43 driver. The application needs at leat 2.6.26 kernel. The last issued and stable kernel what OpenWrt is suggest is&nbsp; 2.4. What would you say if I ask you on the 2.6 kernel based tomato formware publication? Please suggest me a solution. Every piece of information is well appreciated. thank you for your effort.</p>									</div>
