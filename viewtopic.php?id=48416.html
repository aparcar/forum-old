					<p>I think there&#039;s no WR842N. All 842s I run into had detachable antennas, at least in here. The only difference between &quot;n&quot; a &quot;nd&quot; versions across tp link products is the possibility of having the antenna detached, so yeas, the should be the same. But you have to watch the hw version.</p><p>You can flash that image as long as you have V2 of your router and you have that international version. All 842s I have seen were V1, because they have been on the market for at least 2 years, but I heard V2 is out too.</p><p>edit: I took a look on that product you linked, which is probably sold in China only and it really might have different configuration, so it is possible they are not the same. That chinese 842n have even V4 and is not available in here via official channels.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 14 Jan 2014, 12:55)</p>

					<p>someone should fix that makefile.. it makes no sense that wr841 v1-v7 images are named &quot;nd&quot; while 841v8 and 842 are named &quot;n&quot;. (BTW, also wa701n...)</p><p>anyway, the tplink gui will not accept the file if it doesn&#039;t match your hw model and version...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nebbia88</strong> on 14 Jan 2014, 13:35)</p>

					<p>842N is the same as 842ND i think, TP-Link always named the Routers so. &quot;N&quot; No detachable antenna and &quot;ND&quot; detachable antenna. The hardware must be the same. But to ensure you can lookup the hardware.</p>									</div>

					<p>Just started with installation of Barrier Breaker on TL-WR842ND v1.0.&nbsp; &nbsp;(even if the package name is only 842N.)<br />Nice view. Nice menu. Even packages now in the UCI interface.&nbsp; Nice.</p><p>First tests as AP. Looks nice.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>Remark to the WIKI,&nbsp; &nbsp;looks that this device supports VLAN&nbsp; (in Device list stated TL-WR842ND v1.0&nbsp; as NO VLAN).</p><p>Thanks to all developers on openWRT&nbsp; and especially for the new version &quot;Barrier Breaker&quot;.</p>									</div>
