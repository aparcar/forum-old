					<p>If I set the ethers file in the router, should that translation apply to other computers on the network?

					<p>Normally, if your OpenWrt box acts as a gateway for your network, then it is also the DNS server for the network; thus, if you manage to put those entries into the dnsmasq daemon configuration, then they will also apply to your entire network.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry for the long delay, I haven&#039;t had time for my side projects.</p><p>Thanks for the response eduperez. Unfortunately, I can&#039;t seem to get this setup to work.</p><p>As a reminder, or in case my previous explanation didn&#039;t make sense, I&#039;m trying to get my routers /etc/ethers file to act as the translator for the etherwake program on all computers in my network to primarily wake my server. If I set the /etc/ethers file on a computer, I CAN wake the server with an alias, but it means I need to setup each computer manually and adjust for any changes instead of setting it in one place on the router.</p><br /><p><strong>Things I&#039;ve Tried Or Noticed Since My Last Post:</strong></p><ul><li><p>My <em>/etc/dnsmasq.conf</em> file is empty aside from some default documentation. I tried adding dhcp-host entries for the server I am trying to wake up based on a forum I was reading, but all it seemed to do was break my DNS resolver for websites.</p></li><li><p>The <em>/etc/config/hosts</em> was empty as well. I added the MAC hostname and alias entries and they appear to have done nothing so I removed them.</p></li><li><p>The <em>/etc/config/dhcp</em> file appears to contain all of the configuration thanks to the LuCi GUI. I do see entries for MAC, IP and Hostname in there.</p></li><li><p>The <em>/etc/ethers</em> file was empty. I added a simple MAC and hostname (tried hostname and hostname with domain) with a TAB as a separator. Didn&#039;t seem to help either.</p></li><li><p>Finally, I tried editing the <em>/etc/nsswitch.conf</em> on my computer (not the router) to add DNS to the ethers entry. That did nothing as well.</p></li></ul><p>I restarted both computer and router after every change.</p><p>One quirk I did notice, is that if I run <em>arp</em> on my computer, I get the server hostname.domain entry with an (incomplete) entry under the HWaddress column. This doesn&#039;t show up right away (like after reboot) but did show itself again later on and WILL fill in the HWaddress if I start the Server manually. I tried seeing if this entry was caused by a /etc/ethers or /etc/hosts on the router, and thus far it doesn&#039;t seem to be.</p><br /><p>I&#039;m always up for suggestions or recommended reading. Or if this is truly not possible, please tell me so I can stop wasting my time <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Thank you for your time and help.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>InkStone</strong> on 4 Jul 2015, 01:03)</p>
