					<p>I want to be able to monitor the battery level in a portable router. I will be connecting a giant RC car cell instead of the cellphone sized one inside it, so it has a long run time, but when its getting low I want to get notified of that before the protection circuity just cuts out.</p><p>I know some have a battery LED on them, but is that something done by software so the voltage is monitored and the LED lit at a threshold or is it just a hardware chip that is directly connected to it?</p>									</div>

					<p>Most devices control this via a chip in the battery pack it&#039;s self, via SMBus.. The chip reports the battery&#039;s capacity and charge level, every few seconds.</p><p>If the battery that you are using only has 2 connectors, without some dev work, your out of luck. Some batteries have a serial port (usually a single data pin) that you can connect to an unused uart header, and scrape the needed info from..</p><p>However, if you are handy with PIC Microchips, and have one with an analog comparator, you could effectively build your own UART-based battery controller chip.<br />Batteries provide lower and lower voltage as their charge depletes. You just have to check the current voltage level every so often, and react accordingly. Unfortunately, no pocket routers that I am aware of do this; you will either have to use a laptop battery that already has the appropriate circuitry, or develop one yourself.</p><p>Personally, I had to tackle this one myself, using a solar panel, and a 6v powerwheels battery, to power a few of my long-range links.. I ended up writing my own charge controller on a PIC18F</p><p>V/r,<br />Conjur</p>									</div>
