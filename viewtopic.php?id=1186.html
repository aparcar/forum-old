					<p>I am going to set up a WRT for a customer of mine that needs to change just some firewall settings by himself. Since he&#039;s not so keen to ssh, vi and iptables, I was wondering if there is some web interface to the firewalling script. I have found about a web interface project, which is a good starting point, even has a lot more features which I don&#039;t need, but firewall management is not so complete, for example it lacks rules to lock local pcs out of the internet.</p><p>Also, the web interface project seems to be no more actively developed. I also like to play with useful features instead of a web interface, but this time I need one...</p>									</div>

					<p>You could try <a href="http://www.fwbuilder.org">http://www.fwbuilder.org</a>/ , if I&#039;m not mistaken it has a firewall &quot;compiler&quot; specifically for OpenWRT.</p><p>Not sure it&#039;s what you&#039;re looking for, but it&#039;s a great tool anyway.</p>									</div>

In anycase the generated rules looked good, but I don&#039;t have time to test them right now.</p><p>Go ahead give it a whirl.</p><p>Dan</p>									</div>

Maybe (very maybe) it&#039;s of use to you. If not, maybe to someone else someday browsing through the forums.</p><p>fwbuilder generates (shell) scripts with iptables rules, or it can generate an iptables-restore file (which you can quickly load in one go, &quot;quickly&quot; is a good word on a &quot;slow&quot; linksys). I haven&#039;t tried either of them on a linksys yet, but I&#039;m pretty sure it would work.</p>									</div>
