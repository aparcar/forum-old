					<p>No worries, I had the same problems with the previously posted script (bad url parsing, etc). I run the setup in gargoyle as well, seems to work for me, too. Hehe. Reason I added the mobile blocklist (and subsequent whitelist) was because people visiting and using mobiles with apps that stopped working, lol. So tailor the lists to whatever works for your use case. I&#039;ll try to update the script as well. One thing I wanted to do was fetch compressed lists, then uncompress them locally. Saves the list hosts bw costs. Also, there has been other topics on using pixelserv or kwakd so maybe try to incorporate that somehow. Maybe eventually write a plugin for openwrt/gargoyle/etc. Lots of room for improvement. So exciting. Lol.</p>									</div>

					<p>Actually there is another reason why the adblock.sh may not work: it requires iptables-mod-nat-extra to be installed and then the firewall to be restarted.&nbsp; iptables-mod-nat-extra is not installed by default on a fresh install of Attitude Adjustment so the adblock script cannot work on a default OpenWRT install.</p><p>Another issue is that the hosts.txt file obtained from <a href="http://www.mvps.org/winhelp2002/hosts.txt">http://www.mvps.org/winhelp2002/hosts.txt</a> has changed recently such that it no longer uses 127.0.0.1 but 0.0.0.0.&nbsp; According to <a href="http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.htm">http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.htm</a> the reason for this is </p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>... to resolve a slowdown issue with the new Win8.1/IE11 and the HOSTS file.</p></blockquote></div><p>So it&#039;s a good idea to edit adblock.sh and change the mvps line so that it pipes its output through sed and replaces 0.0.0.0 with 127.0.0.1 (this is probably more to do with tidiness than with effectiveness).</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>wget -qO- http://www.mvps.org/winhelp2002/hosts.txt | sed &#039;s/0.0.0.0/127.0.0.1/g&#039; | grep &quot;^127.0.0.1&quot; &gt; /tmp/block.build.list</code></pre></div><p>It would be great if the github page was suitably amended.</p><p>Thanks to frankhou77, phuque99 and teffalump for putting in the time and effort to make this simple.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>julian67</strong> on 12 Jan 2014, 23:54)</p>

					<p>@exxo: The lists have google analytics, google tag services, etc so they should block those services. However, we are blocking by domain name, so if some tracking service is hosted on a non-blocked domain ... too bad. Adblock rules used by adblock plus, for example, do rule matching against page elements, not only domains, allowing finer control and subtlety. I&#039;d suggest using a few other browser addons -- e.g., adblock edge, noscript, etc -- to help block some of these trickier elements.</p>									</div>

I love the simplicity of seeing 1x1 in the browser window instead of an error message. It doesn&#039;t use multiple lists (blacklists, whitelists etc), but I can setup my own list on a server to pull from. </p><div class="quotebox"><cite>aarmot wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Created a script &quot;adblock&quot;, which is based on /languagegame/ ideas and using YOYO sitelist</p><p><a href="https://gist.github.com/aarmot/5730468">https://gist.github.com/aarmot/5730468</a></p><p>Just follow instructions on top of the script.</p></blockquote></div><p>The ideal would be a combination of everyone&#039;s work here!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rinnis</strong> on 14 Feb 2014, 15:42)</p>

					<p>Hi look here ho about ading this script to the adblock one? thes one is from block lists from Spamhaus DROP (Don&#039;t Route Or Peer) and EDROP are advisory &quot;drop all traffic&quot; lists, consisting of netblocks that are <br />&quot;hijacked&quot;<br />or leased by professional spam or cyber-crime operations (used for dissemination of malware, trojan downloaders, botnet controllers). The DROP and EDROP<br />lists are a tiny subset of the SBL, designed for use by firewalls and routing equipment to filter out the malicious traffic from these netblocks. </p><p><a href="http://www.spamhaus.org/xbl/">http://www.spamhaus.org/xbl/</a></p><br /><p>DropList=&quot;/tmp/drop.lasso&quot;<br />wget -O &quot;$DropList&quot; &quot;<a href="http://www.spamhaus.org/drop/drop.lasso">http://www.spamhaus.org/drop/drop.lasso</a>&quot;<br />cat &quot;$DropList&quot; \<br />| sed -e &#039;s/;.*//&#039; \<br />| grep -v &#039;^ *$&#039; \<br />| while read OneNetBlock ; do<br />echo &quot;iptables -I INPUT -s &quot;$OneNetBlock&quot; -j DROP&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/firewall.user<br />echo &quot;iptables -I OUTPUT -d &quot;$OneNetBlock&quot; -j DROP&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/firewall.user<br />echo &quot;iptables -I FORWARD -s &quot;$OneNetBlock&quot; -j DROP&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/firewall.user<br />echo &quot;iptables -I FORWARD -d &quot;$OneNetBlock&quot; -j DROP&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/firewall.user<br />done<br />rm /tmp/drop.lasso</p><p>script by n0pin </p><p><a href="http://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=5513">http://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/vi … amp;t=5513</a></p>									</div>
