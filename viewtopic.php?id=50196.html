					<p>Hello.</p><p>I have an old Asus wl500g just sitting around.<br />Out of fun I made a webcam &quot;mount&quot; (glued 2 servos together and than to the webcam), that can act as a pan/tilt for the webacm.<br />I can operate the pan/tilt usin arduino and its servo library just fine.<br />But, as arduino would mean additional USB port the old WL 500g does not have, I am looking for some option to drive the 2 servos directly using GPIO.<br />Did anyone ever tried this? I googled, but did not found anything for now <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />Thanks in advance for any hints...</p>									</div>

					<p>There is a gpio-pwm module available, so what is mentioned in this video should be more or less possible: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddlDgUymbxc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddlDgUymbxc</a><br />I just don&#039;t know, how exactly the timing of the router will be. Have a look at PCA9685, that chip is connected over I2C and allows setting pwm duty cycles (it is actually a LED dimmer) - and has lately got a kernel driver (although not yet included in openwrt, AFAIK).</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the recommendation.<br />To be honest, I would not like to invest much more into it.<br />I can probably use some of the ATtiny85 I already have and try the suggested i2c communication - it makes a lot of sense from my perspective to let the exact timing on something else than the router itself.<br />I&#039;ll get into it now.<br />Thanks again.</p>									</div>
