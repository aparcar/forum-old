					<p>I have a similar issue with Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH.&nbsp; When I install the pre-built binary for 10.3-RC3, everything seems to work OK (except that extended wireless connection seem to fail after about 10 minutes).&nbsp; I don&#039;t care about that because I am not using the wifi right now and I don&#039;t plan to use it.</p><p>I don&#039;t want to use the pre-built binary because it does not seem to have netem support built into it, and I need the use of netem to simulate various less than ideal network conditions.&nbsp; The issue I am running into is when I build 10.3 from trunk, the Luci interface just doesn&#039;t seem to work.&nbsp; It was sending me to an error page, and then I re-built with the uhttpd server in the menuconfig options.&nbsp; After rebuilding with the uhttpd server option enabled, I just got a list of the www directory it seems.&nbsp; My build does not contain any of the web or lua files the pre-built image contains.</p><p>I tried taring the &#039;www&#039; directory from the pre-built image and then copying it to the same location after loading my custom built image and it just shows a blank screen.&nbsp; I am able to ssh into the router.</p><p>I think I am missing something as simple as selecting the correct menu option, but so far it hasn&#039;t been obvious to me.&nbsp; I am new to the OpenWrt world and that doesn&#039;t help either.</p><p>Other issues of note:</p><p>1. The red &#039;diag&#039; light never turns off on custom built image.<br />2. The green &#039;Router&#039; light (crilce with a line appearing to wrap around it) never comes on with custom built image.<br />3. Custom built image does not transmit a WiFi ESSID.</p><p>I think it apparent I have not configured my custom image properly.&nbsp; But so far, I haven&#039;t seen any documentation to explain how to configure it properly (DISCLAIMER: I may have completely passed the proper documentation by in my haste to complete this task).&nbsp; The main thing I need that the pre-built image doesn&#039;t provide is the QoS scripts and functionality.&nbsp; It didn&#039;t seem that there was any way to use &#039;opkg&#039; to install the QoS functions.</p><p>I think the main thing I am asking for is a straightforward way to know what options will make my custom built image work just like the pre-built image, and then I can make sure to add all of the QoS stuff.</p><p>Thank you in advance and I apologize for rambling if some of this information is not necessary.&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bduhbya</strong> on 2 Nov 2010, 18:10)</p>

					<p>I would agree it sounds as if I am not configuring the image properly.&nbsp; The thing is, it seems much more difficult than I would have anticipated to create an image that works with even standard settings.&nbsp; Maybe I should search for another topic or post a new one.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
