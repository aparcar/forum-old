					<p>Hi, first post.</p><p>I&#039;ve been using whiterussian for a little while, and since it was working fine, got bored with it so decided to try kamikaze.</p><p>The documentation is a little more scarce!&nbsp; This leads to a couple of questions:</p><p>Are the /etc/config file options documented anywhere is a systematic (or semi-systematic) manner?&nbsp; At the moment I&#039;m reading init.d scripts to work out what options exist and what they might do (that and guessing, with a sprinkling of trial-and-error, anyhow).&nbsp; I&#039;ve spent some time in the wiki (where some stuff is found), and a little time at dev.openwrt.org but not found a master list of such things.</p><p>Presumably, if I felt inspired to write down what I&#039;ve found out in the wiki, no-one is going to object.&nbsp; However, if I do that will anyone that actually knows what the options do (as opposed to me that&#039;s merely guessing) feel inspired to fix any howlers I make?</p><p>Which leads onto the second question - the wiki has lots of stuff in there, but some of the layout is, err, idiosyncratic.&nbsp; For example, front page - what leaps out? - various ways to hack the hardware.&nbsp; That comes before teh information about actually installing and configuring.&nbsp; Is there a master plan / cabal / overlord that I will cross if I were (hypothetically) to do something presumptuous like change the layout or add links to the front page?&nbsp; Are particular pages / areas under oversight of particular people?&nbsp; I know wikis are supposed to be a collaborative free-for-all, but I also know some are free-er than others...</p><p>regards,&nbsp; &nbsp;Ian SMith</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;d welcome any additional info for the Kami wiki as documentation is quite sparse.&nbsp; <br />I spent the whole weekend trying to understand iptables when all I want to do is simple home-network stuff.<br />Despite the dirth of docs, Kami is still awesome.&nbsp; BANZAI !!!</p>									</div>
