					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have a TP-Link TL-WR1043N/ND v1 router with OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment 12.09 / LuCI 0.11.1 Release (0.11.1).</p><p>I&#039;m using a USB stick as root disk (followed the instructions from <a href="http://h-wrt.com/en/doc/flash)">http://h-wrt.com/en/doc/flash)</a> and it has been working fine for ~1 year or so.</p><p>Now, I&#039;d like to improve the reliability of it by implementing a RAID1 (mirror) setup, with 2 USB sticks.<br />I know one of the requirements would be to have initramfs (in order to boot some kind of light OS than can recognize and mount RAID arrays), but&nbsp; according to <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/requirements.boot.process">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/req â€¦ ot.process</a> its not possible to have initramfs.</p><p>I imagine it should be possible with some workaround.</p><p>Is there anyone that was able to implement RAID1 on its USB router that could give some hints?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Jabss</p>									</div>
