					<p>I read that VPN on openWRT is not as easy to setup as DDWRT due to lack of GUI. However, I have read openWRT is more supported so am doing a bit of research trying to find a router that I can use. I have been running a WRT54GL with openVPN on top and it has been running pretty well. Throughput is limited due to hardware so I am looking to upgrade.</p><p>Also, I did some research on routers. If I am looking to go with gigabit ports, fast transfer rate/throughput, USB ports, and to use mainly for VPN server, is the ASUS RT-N66 a good choice? I will be connecting it (bridging) it to an existing router.</p><p>Any help is appreciated.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>amrogers3</strong> on 15 Feb 2014, 17:07)</p>

					<p>Been doing some research and found the TP-Link TL-WDR4900 has some good throughput and is compatible with openWRT. However is it upwards of $200 and doesn&#039;t appear to be readily available in the U.S. </p><p>Any recommendations for a suitable alternative?</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s not clear what sort of VPN you need - client to site or site to site or both?</p><p>Also what&#039;s your current &quot;throughput&quot; and your ISP speed?</p><p>The WRT54GL is fairly dated hardware @200Mhz and 16MB ram, so pretty much any router today would have 2x/3x the CPU and RAM, which would give you a significant boost in &quot;throughput&quot;.</p><p>Saying that. if you&#039;re looking for a easiest way to setup a VPN, I would highly recommend this tutorial which is based on TomatoUSB. The Belkin routers linked in the tutorials should be considered.</p><p>[Tutorial - 30 Minutes or Less] Site to Site VPN with TomatoUSB and OpenVPN<br /><a href="http://blog.qnology.com/2013/02/tutorial-30-minutes-or-less-site-to.html">http://blog.qnology.com/2013/02/tutoria â€¦ te-to.html</a></p>									</div>
