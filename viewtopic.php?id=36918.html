					<p>Hello,</p><p>Some devices are listed as unsupported because they don&#039;t have enough RAM. I understand that this means I can&#039;t just put OpenWRT on them and start using them right away... But wouldn&#039;t it be possible, at least for some of those devices, to add extrernal memory and then run OpenWRT? Even if I have to hack the device and add an SD card or USB port, or something like that (I suppose these hacks are not possible on all devices, but if I could find one or two very cheap models that I could add external RAM to it would be great).</p><p>So... Has anyone tried this already?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Anything is possible given enough motivation. Considering the cost of most of the supported routers, it makes sense just to buy one that suits. Adding USB to a device that does not have it is usually non-trivial. Many of the earlier chip sets do not have USB support, so adding it is next to impossible. Some of the later models have a chip that supports USB, but it isnt wired in - adding the connector is possible in some instances. Adding a SD-card has been done for some of the older routers like the WRT54 where some available i/o was found. Note that adding USB or a SDcard does not give you more ram! It gives you storage (flash). With the cost of devices like the tp-link wr1043, its just easier to buy one of these, load up openwrt and you&#039;re away without having to open the box and solder little wires and bits and pieces that inevitably break. Mind you, I did a ram upgrade to mine simply because I could.</p>									</div>
