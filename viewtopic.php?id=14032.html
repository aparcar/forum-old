					<p>I need to send a few boxes from the US to EU. Is there an inexpensive online source for universal (90-240v) or EU (220-240 v) power adapters for the WRT54G&nbsp; (requires voltage around 12 volts and 1 Amp -&nbsp; 6 or 9&nbsp; volts will also work). <br />Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>I actually found some cheap suppliers of 110/220 volt adapter for the WRT54G&nbsp; in the US. <br />1. JWIN&nbsp; www..ejwin.com&nbsp; (look under Accessories/Adapters) has the JAC-82 for sale for $4.88&nbsp; + shipping. The units come with a variety of interchangeable plugs&nbsp; (the 2.1mm and 2.5mm ones work fine with the wrt54g) and a number of voltages including the required 12 volts.&nbsp; &nbsp;The unit is heavy - more than a pound -&nbsp; and they are unregulated - so don&#039;t use it with other hardware which may require regulated supplies.&nbsp; You will need a Euro plug adapter - but you could find those in Indian or Oriental supermarkets for less than&nbsp; $1<br />2. Netgate <a href="http://www.netgate.com">www.netgate.com</a>&nbsp; has a switching power supply 12 volts - 1 Amp with a 2.1mm connector and even a Euro plug. Currently (Jan 30, 2008) this is on special sale for $8.00 - marked down from $15.50&nbsp; They have other regular priced units for $12.50.</p>									</div>
