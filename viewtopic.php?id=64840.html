					<p>I have a Buffalo AirStation HighPower N600 WZR-600DHP router that has a 10/100/1000 wan port and running Chaos Calmer 15.05.1, the issue i am having is the wan port will only run at 100mbps when connected to my cable modem (Arris CM820A) that has a gb port on it. I have 200mbps internet and only able to use 1/2 its speed. </p><p>If i connect computer to port on modem the connection between the two is 1000mbps so its not an issue with the modem. If i connect any device to wan port on router to test the speed, I am only able to get a 100mbps connection. I have tried many cables, Cat5 / Cat5e / Cat6. I was having the issue in Openwrt Barrier Breaker also before i upgraded to Chaos Calmer to see if that would fix the issue but didn&#039;t. I have also tried to use ethtool and force the wan interface to gb but the link dies. Does anyone know anything to try to fix this issue?</p>									</div>

					<p>Your device seems to say this it supports and is advertising 10/100/1000<br />But the link partner (modem) is only advertising 10/100<br />And so you are getting 100/full negotiated.<br />If possible turn off auto-negotiation on both and force them both to be 1000/full</p>									</div>
