					<p>I have successfully (I think) installed OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 into an older D-Link DIR-601 Rev A. Generally, things are working fine except the Wi-Fi signal strength very low. It&#039;s low enough that it barely sometimes (and sometimes not) can connect when my laptop is right next to it, but cannot when it&#039;s on the other side of the room.</p><p>I played with the Transmit Power setting, trying full power (16 dBm) and much lower (10 dBm) and it didn&#039;t make any difference.</p><p>I can&#039;t see anything obviously wrong with the hardware. (I did connect pins to the serial connection, but they are not attached to anything now.) </p><p>Is there some setting I&#039;m messing up? Anything else obvious?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>You should consider trying LEDE instead of OpenWrt, and see if your problem persists. OpenWrt CC edition has not received any update for quite some time now, and it is very much possible that the speed issue has already been resolved in LEDE.</p><p>You should be able to find a suitable &#039;sysupgrade&#039; image for your router from here: <a href="https://downloads.lede-project.org/releases/17.01.4/targets/ar71xx/generic/">https://downloads.lede-project.org/rele â€¦ x/generic/</a></p><p>Download it, use LuCI&#039;s sysupgrade method to flash it, and remember to uncheck the &quot;keep configuration&quot; checkbox so LEDE can establish new configuration defaults for your device. Then modify those defaults as required by your scenario.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think I will go back to the factory firmware and do a double-check on the hardware. </p><p>I thought about installing LEDE, which I think is better long-term for what I need to do, but the router only has 4MB of flash, which as I understand is a tight fit.</p><p>Thanks for the help.</p>									</div>

					<p>Very interesting, Joe! It is my understanding that DIR-600 and 601 are very similar. Now I&#039;m wondering who else has the problem and if there&#039;s a fix.</p><p>Have you had luck with DD-WRT or other firmware?</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, good news and bad news. The good news (for the developers and community) is that I reverted the firmware back to the factory D-Link code, and the problem was still there, so I must have buggered up the hardware somehow. The bad news (for me) is that I had to buy a new router!</p><p>Thanks for everyone&#039;s help.</p>									</div>
