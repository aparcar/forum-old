					<p>I started using updatedd for dyndns with Kamikaze (7.06, WRT54GL v1).&nbsp; It appears that updatedd attempts to update the IP at dyndns too frequently which has resulted in my dyndns ID being suspended for abuse.&nbsp; Is there a way to limit how often updatedd tries to update dyndns or prevent it from updating if the IP has not changed?&nbsp; Are there some additonal options in /etc/config/updatedd?&nbsp; Thanks...</p>									</div>

					<p>Strange. I&#039;m using updatedd as well but never had any trouble with dyndns because of it. I thought it updated on dial up only (using hotplug iface wan), cause that&#039;s when the IP changes... where are 1 hour intervals supposed to be coming from, with no cron installed?</p>									</div>
