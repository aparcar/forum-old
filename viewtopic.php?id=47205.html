					<p>Ive been fiddling at this for weeks and i just cant figure it out.&nbsp; I have a Sky hub router that i have disabled DHCP and Wifi so that my WDR4300 running openwrt can act as the main router.</p><p>On the Sky hub i have placed the IP of the WDR4300 in its DMZ and as such any clients attached to the router can access internet via the Sky hub through the WDR4300.</p><p>The issue is that when i ssh onto the WDR4300 and ping an internet address i cannot get a responce.</p><p>I dont even know where i am with my config anymore so i really want to start from scratch to try and find this out.</p><p>Can anyone provide some guidance to try and figure this out, ill prove any logs or config output needed</p>									</div>
