					<p>Hello everybody,</p><p>I&#039;am new here in this community an have many questions about OpenWrt.</p><p>1. Which version schould I use? Kamikaze or Backfire?</p><p>2. Is it possible to change the layout of the Webinterface?<br />That means if I want my own Brandmarklogo on the Webinterface, is it possible?</p><p>3. Is it allowed so sell Routers which are running with a specific configurated (by my self) OpenWrt.<br />That Means I want to install OpenWrt on a Router and configure OpenWrt with my own logo etc. and install some extra features.</p><p>It would be nice if you guys could help me to answer this questions.</p><p>Thanks a lot.</p><p>Greetings</p><p>aykay</p>									</div>

					<p>Kamikaze is ancient. Don&#039;t use it.<br />Backfire 10.03.1 is the current stable version. It is ok.<br />Also the trunk &quot;Attitude Adjustment&quot; development version is ok for most of the time.</p><p>Whole source of the web interface is available there, so you can change anything you want (and have skills to do).</p><p>Reagrding licenses &amp; &quot;allowed stuff&quot;, you better read the license stuff. E.g. <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/LICENSE">https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/LICENSE</a></p>									</div>

That&#039;s fine. You are just obligated to provide the source code when you distribute any binaries though. This is something people have a hard time with... it&#039;s not a &quot;buy my product and fill out this form and maybe a month later we&#039;ll mail you outdated source code&quot;... it&#039;s &quot;here&#039;s my product and here&#039;s the source.&quot;</p>									</div>
