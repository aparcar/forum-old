					<p>@RangerZ, thank you for the helpful information. I really don&#039;t want to reinvent the wheel, but I have searched for an appropriate dual-band travel router, and all that I have found have significant limitations.&nbsp; My requirements:<br />1) the LAN AP at 5 GHz<br />2) the WAN client side, either Ethernet or Wi-Fi<br />3) Flexible configuration mechanism for WAN port Wi-Fi client connection&nbsp; (I have tried to use various Wi-Fi to Ethernet clients, but they fail to connect to many hotel networks) </p><p>I will examine all the OpenWRT compatible travel routers you mention.&nbsp; One question - since they come with a 2.4 GHz radio, and I will be adding the 5 GHz by USB, is it possible to make the USB radio the AP, and the built-in radio the WAN client? </p><p>I understand the single-radio issues, thus my intention to use two radio. </p><p>Thanks for the link on the usb essentials, I&#039;m heading there now.</p><p>I have been working with the Ralink 5572 chipset which is in the Rosewill RNX-N600UB (probably others). I have made it work under Raspbian with the nl80211 driver and hostapd.&nbsp; But there are a variety of problems, and I can&#039;t seem to keep the AP running over time: </p><p>First <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=28&amp;t=134588">this issue</a> with bridging. Still not solved, just commented it out of /etc/network/interfaces to concentrate on getting the AP function to work.&nbsp; This post also has all the driver and configuration info for the Ralink 5572.</p><p>Then <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=28&amp;t=134690&amp;p=896715#p896715">this issue</a> with hostapd, that I was able to fix by stumbling on rpi-update.</p><p>Then <a href="http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/42570/ralink-5572-hostapd-fails-at-5-ghz-unless-first-run-in-2-4-ghz-band">this issue</a> with hostapd and enabling 5 GHz channels.&nbsp; Still no solution - was working on shell scripting work-arounds.</p><p>Latest is <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=28&amp;t=136170">this issue</a> where the wlan0 interface for the AP loses its statically configured IP and reverts to APIA.&nbsp; I rolled back the changes for NAT routing, but it still happens.&nbsp; Before I didn&#039;t let it sit long enough. Somehow a DHCP client function is also claiming wlan0 and overriding with APIA, even though I have it set for static, and have a DHCP server on that interface. </p><p>So you can see I&#039;ve been working on this for weeks, and posted lots of questions in Raspberry Pi forums, and nobody has replied with any answers.&nbsp; So I thought I&#039;d look at OpenWRT, which is already optimized to be a router. And, I _really_ appreciate you took the time to post a reply! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /> <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>timg11</strong> on 14 Feb 2016, 18:56)</p>

					<p>Confirming anarch99&#039;s response, yes.&nbsp; You can assign wich one you want in the wifi tab.

					<p>Why use 5 GHz for the LAN?&nbsp; Well, this is a travel router for use in hotels. I have a notebook computer, a tablet, and a phone that I want to be able to communicate with each other on a private network. Some media sharing, and general file transfer between these devices. Range is a few meters, within a room, so the shorter range at 5 GHz is not an issue. Most hotels have dozens of APs visible in the 2.4 band. Add to that many individual&#039;s running their own hotspots also in the 2.4 GHz band, and then add the illegal jamming behavior some hotels do to try and block private hotspots, and the 2.4 GHz band is not very attractive.&nbsp; </p><p>I agree that a two radio setup with the LAN on channel 1 and the WAN on channel 11 (or the reverse depending on the strength and channel of the best AP for the WAN to connect to) is also workable, and definitely better than single radio devices. </p><p>So for next steps, I guess I need to determine if OpenWRT can support my Ralink 5572 dongle. </p><p>Then I can select one of the travel routers that are supported and have a USB port.&nbsp; &nbsp; Which would you recommend in terms of performance, stability, reliability, build quality, etc?&nbsp; I&#039;m looking for something small and light, that will always work, and be flexible and configurable enough to deal with various networking situations I find in various places.&nbsp; My short list at the moment is Alfa AP121U, TP-Link TL-MR3020, A5-V11 Mini Router. The WLAE-AG300N looked interesting, but seems to be discontinued, with a few places selling it for about $150US.&nbsp; The Kingston&nbsp; MLWG3 looks good if it is ever supported.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>timg11</strong> on 15 Feb 2016, 01:18)</p>

					<p>Good answer!</p><p>I have a GLI-AR150 that I spent 6 weeks traveling with recently.&nbsp; I did not use it with a second radio however.&nbsp; It comes with OpenWrt and a GUI by GLI.&nbsp; The GUI is real good at managing the AP side connection (incorrectly called a repeater).&nbsp; It has a AR 400mhz cpu and 16/64 for memory.&nbsp; Comes setup with USB for file sharing and will support a camera.&nbsp; They now have a newer version with an MT7620n 580mhz, (MT300N) and soon will have another with a 128MB (MT300A).&nbsp; I think the AR150 is in trunk, and GLI has a CC version without their GUI, but I like it.</p><p>Guessing only at 2.4.&nbsp; I use the driver in a buffalo device I have on my HooToo.&nbsp; I get about 7mbps with it.<br /><a href="https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Ralink_RT5572">https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Ralink_RT5572</a></p>									</div>

					<p>In general, you&#039;d have more fun with using USB wlan cards in STA mode, rather than AP mode. AP mode needs a wlan card and a driver that are optimised for it - something you rarely find in a USB device, with the firmware often been an additional limiting factor. Unfortunately this is a problem for your plans in terms of radio distribution, as most cheap routers only come with a 2.4 GHz radio and retrofitting a 5 GHz USB wlan card appears to be the easier solution - until you fall over the troubles of using &#039;any&#039; given USB wlan card as AP...</p><p>If size isn&#039;t a particular dealbreaker, consider going with a normal dual-radio router instead, rather than a dedicated/ small mobile variant.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>slh</strong> on 15 Feb 2016, 01:52)</p>

					<p>Which is exactly the problem, there are AP mode specific bugs unless the vendor explicitly tests AP mode - because AP mode needs features of the wlan card beyond those needed for STA mode.

					<p>@slh - Yes, overall size is pretty important to me. I want to tuck this into a small pocket in my computer bag, which is already far to heavy.

I was hoping the AP implementation in OpenWRT would be better. But you&#039;re saying it might not help because of fundamental bugs or missing features in the USB devices.</p><p>@Alex Atkin UK, so are there any travel-size router platforms that have a PCIe slot? Maybe that&#039;s the way to approach this rather than USB for the AP? I have a dual band PCIe WLAN module taken out of a notebook, which is about the size of a postage stamp.</p>									</div>

					<p>first check if the GLI supports both WLAN and WWAN cards. from a quick look at the picture it is obvious it has USB D+ and D- lines that are used for WWAN cards via USB protocol but the question is are the rest of connected pins enough for WLAN cards that use PCI protocol.</p><p>I am telling you this from my own experience. first router I managed to run openwrt on was 3G but could not detect WLAN card in mPCIe slot.</p><p>even more dumber than it&#039;s manufacturer was HP who didn&#039;t provide USB lines in a laptop&#039;s mPCIe slot I&#039;m using so my new WLAN+BT card&#039;s bluetooth doesn&#039;t work..</p>									</div>

					<p>I wanted to report back on <a href="http://www.gl-inet.com/forums/topic/mifi-support-for-wlan-in-pci-express-slot/">what I learned at GLI forum</a>. In summary, their PCI-e board design is really just USB in a PCI-e form factor.&nbsp; So there is no benefit over normal USB dongles (as far as I can tell).</p>									</div>
