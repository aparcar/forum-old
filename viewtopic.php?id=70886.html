					<p>As the tittle says, my ISP called me today and offered me double speeds via Bonding and a new ISP Modem.<br />ISP also told me that Bridge Mode would also work.</p><p>My time is currently limited and i need my interwebs before i agree to this ISP upgrade i would like to know if this might affect my openwrt on a TP-Link WDR3600 v1.4 (N600).</p><p>Will it just work or do i have to consider possible reconfiguration, compiles and what not or ?</p>									</div>

					<p>If this is DSL, and they provide a two-line modem, the modem should handle the bonding internally in a way that is transparent to the router.&nbsp; The router would still see one Internet connection the same way it does now, but twice as fast.&nbsp; The only change you may need to do is to improve the house wiring so that two telephone line twisted pairs go from the phone company to the modem instead of one.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 11 May 2017, 03:42)</p>
