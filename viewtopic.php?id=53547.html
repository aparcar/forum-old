					<p>Hi All,<br />I&#039;ve read as much of the wiki/documentation as I can but still can&#039;t figure out my issue.&nbsp; Currently using a TP-Link MR3040 but I don&#039;t think this is a hardware specific issue.</p><p>Basically, I just want this router to work like my home router (Netgear 8000) with similar functionality.&nbsp; What that means is that I want to be able to plug in any random internet connection like a hotel ethernet cable or an ethernet cable from my R8000 LAN and simply access the OpenWRT admin page from the 192.168.0.1 address regardless of what internet source is plugged in.&nbsp; Is this possible?</p><p>I can&#039;t seem to make it happen.&nbsp; I&#039;ve setup the 3040 to use a static IP address (192.168.0.1) but this causes an issue because when I plug it into my R8000, the 3040 won&#039;t get internet (presumably because the static IP is outside the 192.168.100-199 DHCP range I&#039;ve setup on the 8000).&nbsp; But if I put the static IP inside the R8000&#039;s DHCP range, then I have to access it from whatever IP the R8000 assigns to it.&nbsp; Ok for home but I assume this setting would cause an issue when I take the 3040 to a hotel with an ethernet connection (right?) as the hotel network is likely not going to issue me a 192.168.1.XXX address the same as what my R8000 did at home?? </p><p>I just want the 3040 to accept any IP address but still be able to access the admin page from the same 192.168.0.1 address no matter what internet connection is plugged (either a LAN cable from another router, a cable modem, a hotel ethernet cable, etc).&nbsp; I have a portable HooToo travel router that does this easily.&nbsp; It lets me set it to dynamic IP (so it accepts whatever IP address its given) but I can always access the router at 192.168.0.1.&nbsp; How do I do this in OpenWRT? I&#039;ve setup over 30 routers in my lifetime and my quite familiar with networking in general but this one has me stumped.&nbsp; I feel like its an extremely simple solution/setting that I am just not seeing.</p><p>The other thing I want to accomplish is to be able to setup the 3040 in a bridge-type mode.&nbsp; I would like it to be able to connect to a random wifi network then use that as the internet source to rebroadcast to my devices over both the single ethernet port and wireless with my own separate SSID with the 3040 acting as a DHCP server.&nbsp; Is this possible?<br />Thanks for any assistance that you can provide.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Marty1781</strong> on 23 Oct 2014, 01:19)</p>

					<p>I wonder if there is a conflict because you might have two networks with the same 192.168.0.0 subnet address. In that case the 3040 should have a different subnet from your home router. </p><p>My wireless router has a 192.168.1.1 static address to prevent conflicts with the &#039;broadband&#039; 192.168.0.0 subnet. You might be able to use the 192.168.0.1 static address in a hotel or when directly connected to a modem just not when connected to your home router.</p>									</div>

By default, a single ethernet port in OpenWrt is configured as LAN, which makes sense because you need it to do initial configuration. However, for your purpose it must be configured as WAN, decoupled from the LAN interface that is only there for the Wifi afterwards. Have a look at the &quot;configure OpenWrt&quot; section of <a href="https://stuff.purdon.ca/?page_id=370">this howto</a> which I found somewhat more suitable than OpenWrt&#039;s own howtos (mainly because they are not tailored towards single-port devices). </p><p>Also, I would recommend using a different, rather arbitrary IP range for your LAN. 192.168.0.1/24 and 192.168.1.1/24 are very popular ranges, so chances are your LAN will clash with the hotels&#039; networks. It&#039;s better to choose something less popular, for example from the 172.16.x.x range.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 23 Oct 2014, 16:51)</p>
