					<p>Hi all, </p><p>I have a Tp-link W8970 and I&#039;d like to set it in this way:<br />Access point by the router antenna and 1 to 3 eth port.<br />STA from external usb wifi dongle (Alfa Network AWUS036NHA - AR9271).<br />So, in output I want two subnet with different signal because I want to input it in a load balacing router Tp-link TL-R470T+.<br />Is possibile?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, it should be possible.</p><p>You create three networks in the W8970 device. First network is the one hosted by the AP station on this router, and includes three Ethernet ports. Second network is the wired connection to the TL-R470 device using the last port. Third network is the wireless connection from the external USB STA to the TL-R470.</p><p>Although this setup is possible in theory and in practice, it&#039;s feasibility is in question. If your intention is to gain more throughput, then the 150 Mbps wireless link provided by the external wireless device pales in comparison to the transfer speeds through the wired Gigabit Ethernet link. It&#039;s like having a 60 ton truck and trying to &quot;augment&quot; it by adding a 1 ton trailer.</p><p>So, care to explain what the purpose of such a setup is?</p>									</div>

					<p>Antek, thanks for you reply.<br />You&#039;re right but I don&#039;t want to share file across the two line. My purpose is the bandwitch aggregation of my isp internet connection (cabled) with another wireless internet access, or, alternativly, use this last as backup connection.<br />For now I have setted the w8970 in this way:<br />LAN1: input the primary connection of my isp (192.168.1/24). DHCP disabled.<br />LAN2: output to the WAN1 of the TL-R470<br />LAN3: input for another pc (free at this time)<br />LAN4: output to the WAN2 of the TL-R470</p><p>Do you think this configuration makes sense?<br />Thanks!</p>									</div>
