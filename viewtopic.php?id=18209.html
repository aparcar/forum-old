					<p>What am I missing?!! Pardon my frustration...but I&#039;m amazed I cannot find the answer to my question...Apparently I&#039;m the first person on the whole Internet to ever ask this question because NO search engine would give me a answer.&nbsp; Here is my question;&nbsp; Please recommend a good 4 port Gigabit router with wireless support...that is supported by OpenWRT.&nbsp; I love OpenWRT...but you WIKI layout doesn&#039;t seem very useful.&nbsp; It would be really nice to just have a page that lists all the Gigabit routers that are supported...or better yet..list the 3 best/most popular ones.</p><p>So please someone help me out...give me the names of Gigabit routers with 4 LAN ports and wireless support.&nbsp; If someone responds and I&#039;m able to load OpenWRT on the router...I promise I&#039;ll start this page on the OpenWRT Wiki.</p>									</div>

					<p>You aren&#039;t very clear on your requirements. That is probably why you can&#039;t find what you are looking for. What do you mean by a gigabit router?</p><p>Are you looking for a device with 5 ethernet ports consisting of a 4(+1) port gigabit switch on LAN side and a gigabit WAN port? What are your through put expectations? What kind of performance are you looking for on the wireless side? Are there any other requirements such as encryption support and corresponding performance?</p>									</div>

					<p>How can I add anything to the OpenWRT wiki when I don&#039;t know anything for sure?&nbsp; Will I guess I can start listing all the Gigabit Routers that I&#039;ve tried to buy that are NOT supported by OpenWRT.&nbsp; Well I&#039;ll give it a start anyway.</p><p>cherry31459, I&#039;m trying not to be picky...my only two requirements would be that it have at least 4 Gigabit ports and be supported by OpenWRT.</p><p>I&#039;ll Build a Wiki page and link to it here in this thread.</p>									</div>
