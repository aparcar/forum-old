What exactly is/are the problem(s). All I wanted to say is that trunk wont work without modifications (to the source code), so don&#039;t run that, but is that all? </p><p>The problems with the ubifs (actually it already reports errors during the mtd parsing, at least I noticed that in the first log) I can not solve. If CC is run on an r8000 and you get those kind of problems then I assume that a new version of R8000 was released with a different flash configuration which is causing a problem, at least that is what I would make of it. I&#039;m just not familiar enough with that stuff to fix it, nor do I have that problem, so I cant debug it either. But I also read reports which I think seems to indicate that some people have flashed trunk (buildbot image), that didn&#039;t work (don&#039;t know for what reason), then switched back to CC and that started failing as well (where it initially worked). If that is the case then I can give that a try locally and see if I can figure out why not. I&#039;d like to understand what people have done and what is failing. As said if your r8000 doesn&#039;t work with any openwrt image and never has then I probably cant do much as I cant reproduce. If it used to work, but after reflashing some images (trunk) it fails on CC (which used to work) then that is something I could give a try.</p>									</div>

The ethernet switch wont work and you wont be able to access your router anymore. The only thing left to do is connect to the serial port and use CFE/tftp(d) to flash an other image.</p><p>So the CC image did boot again, but you were not able to access it anymore. When reflashing (through CFE) the router goes back to ip address 192.168.1.1. It will also loose all wireless configuration. So you have to use ethernet (and browse to 192.168.1.1) to reconfigure it. Did you try that?</p>									</div>

					<p>Just like to point out for the record that obviously there is something strange with my R8000 as I&#039;m still having the &quot;No UBI partition/no rootfs detected&quot; kernel panic even with arokh&#039;s latest image. Really annoyed as the problem occurs waaay too early in the boot process for me to have any clue how to try and debug it. Is there a version number or revision on the PCB somewhere that we can compare to at least determine if I&#039;ve got some wacky/wierdo unit compared to the ones that work?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hm, so it&#039;s not a problem with the kernel then. Only some units? Didn&#039;t know there were different revisions. Could the partition table just be messed up somehow during flashing?</p>									</div>

					<p>One thing to notice:<br />Seems that the stock firmware can do some configuration that won&#039;t be erased by reflashing openwrt or itself. Such as LAN IP</p>									</div>

					<p>Just a side question. Does any one compare the wifi signal strength and range between stock and OpenWRT?</p><p> I didn&#039;t test stock and seems the range is not good compare to other router (WRT1900AC).</p><p>So, if it&#039;s the same for both firmware, then I&#039;m think it&#039;s either hardware or software limitation for now.</p>									</div>

But 2.4G is quite good.<br />For stability, I think is good enough for home user, but don&#039;t expect it can do 24*365 without anything wrong.<br />I use enterprise solution at home for my gateway/firewall/core switch, and use R8000 just as an AP or temp gateway/NAS in traveling.</p>									</div>
