					<p>Hi,<br />I am a user of TP-Link TL-MR3220 v2. I have been eagerly waiting for the open-wrt release for TP-Link MR-3220 v2 for a while because I dont get to play around my router with default firmware.</p><p>The code in the trunk has not been tagged yet. </p><p>Is it stable to be flashed? I do not want my router to be bricked.</p><p> Shall I checkout the code and proceed installing?</p><p>If there is something I am missing out, please let me know.</p>									</div>

					<p>You are absolutely correct sometimes, if you are getting problem with the previous firmware. I highly recommend you doing the firmware upgrade that will definitely work.</p>									</div>
