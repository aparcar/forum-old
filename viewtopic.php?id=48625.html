					<p>I have a TP-Link Archer C7 and installed Open-WRT on it a while ago. I followed this thread: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=213547#p213547">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php â€¦ 47#p213547</a></p><p>I have successfully done so and ran it for a while. Then I had a slow connection. So for some reason I changed some setting on the device by SSHing in and editing the file directly on the router. This was stupid. I know.</p><p>To be honest I&#039;m not sure what I changed (It was a while ago so I just gave up and left it, so I forgot)... <br />What I do know is that, unfortunately my router is unusable now.</p><p>I tried doing what this thread <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=38953">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=38953</a> suggested but can only see my PC asking for 192.168.1.254 using WireShark.</p><p>What I see when looking at the ARP protocol is:<br />AsustekC_##:##:##&nbsp; &nbsp; Broadcast&nbsp; &nbsp; ARP&nbsp; &nbsp; 42&nbsp; &nbsp; Who has 192.168.1.254?&nbsp; Tell 192.168.1.1</p><p>My PC is 192.168.1.1</p><p>I&#039;ve also tried booting into safe mode which does not seem to be working.</p><p>Is there any way that I can restore my router?</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p><p>I&#039;m not at all knowledgeable with networks and routers and stuff. I just know I screwed up.</p>									</div>

					<p>My Archer C7 V2.0 was not responding to restoring original firmware from TP-Link. All I got was all blinking light.</p><p>However I had success with restoring OpenWRT firmware from this page: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr7500">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr7500</a><br />I&#039;m sure I will be able to install orginal firmware from OpenWRT console afterwards. Just happy that my router is still alive.</p><p>A difference from original instruction: Connect cable to Eth port, not WAN. I was using Ethernet 1.</p>									</div>
