					<p>Just a fYI ---</p><p>Look at the output cat /proc/interrupts </p><p>Notice how the chipset if mainly just using Processor 0. For the exception of the 1st line, and a few of the bottom lines. 2.4Ghz, 5Ghz, Eth0 and Eth1 are all using proc0. This is a issue during load tests because Processor0 becomes 100% loaded whilst processor1 sits mainly idle.</p><p>My work around was to add a script to /etc/rc.local that during boot splits Eth0 (proc0), Eth1(proc1, 2.4Ghz(proc1) and 5Ghz(proc0). During Outside NAT loads tests, both processors are utilized (depending on the test), and there seems to a small bump in performance through Eth1 (unconfirmed by others).</p><p>Here is the question: Though Eth1,Eth0,2.4Ghz and 5Ghz are set, by default, to affinity of 3... they only grab 1 processor even through affinity_list is set to 0-1. Is this a chipset limitation or a current driver limitation? It seems a better use of resources through IRQ list would be to balance the load between 2 processors, instead of just one. </p><p>Thoughts?</p>									</div>
