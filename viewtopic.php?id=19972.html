					<p>I installed OpenWRT and X-Wrt on my DG834Gv2 and from the X-Wrt configuration (which was on 192.168.1.1) put the network into DHCP mode, so that it gets an IP from the university network which I&#039;m on. It now does what I&#039;d hoped in that I can share my internet connection through it, but I now can&#039;t get back into it to configure it, because it no longer seems to be on 192.168.1.1!</p><p>Is there any way of finding the IP address of the router from a connected computer? If I run a &#039;netstat -rn&#039; the only gateway IP it gives is that of the university network&#039;s gateway, it&#039;s as though the router is invisible all of a sudden. I&#039;m not sure what other information may be needed, but let me know and I&#039;ll post it.</p><p>Many thanks,</p><p>Simon.</p>									</div>

					<p>First, unplug it from the network.</p><p>Next plug your other computer directly into your DG834Gv2.&nbsp; Now you can safely portscan it without annoying everyone else on campus.&nbsp; If you left the default firewall rules in place then it should respond to ICMP traffic so you should have no trouble pinging the whole subnet and getting a response back from your router.&nbsp; If all else fails, rebooting it and run a DHCP server on your own computer will allow you to assign a new IP address to the router.</p><p>It sounds like you may have done something a bit odd, though.&nbsp; If you are trying to share your network connection through the router then only the WAN port should be connected to the university network.&nbsp; The LAN ports should be on a different network with a static IP address and acting as a DHCP server, not client.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks very much for your reply. I took the coward&#039;s way out in the end and just recovered/reinstalled OpenWrt, so now I&#039;m back to square one. (Well, square two perhaps, since OpenWrt&#039;s working again).</p><p>Agreed with what you say, although the WAN port on the DG834G is an ADSL port, since it&#039;s a combined router/access point/modem jobbie. How would I go about telling OpenWrt to use one of the LAN ports to connect to the university LAN and then run a DHCP server to share that to the others without mucking everything up do you think?</p><p>Many thanks again.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not familiar with that model but you should be able to do that with VLANs.&nbsp; Just configure one of the LAN ports as a VLAN and use that for your upstream connection and use the other ports on a separate VLAN for your local clients.</p><p>With a Broadcom switch that&#039;s as simple as putting these lines into /etc/config/network:</p><p>&lt;code&gt;config switch eth0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan0&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;0 1 2 3 5*&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan1&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;4 5&quot;</p><p>config interface wan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp;eth0.1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;dhcp&#039;</p><p>config interface lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp;eth0.0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; static<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr&nbsp; &nbsp;192.168.1.1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask&nbsp; 255.255.255.0&lt;/code&gt;</p><p>Your AR7 system may work the same way, but it uses a Marvell switch which may not be supported by OpenWRT.&nbsp; <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/99">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/99</a> suggests that it isn&#039;t, but I saw some mention of a patch to fix that so I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s still outstanding.</p>									</div>
