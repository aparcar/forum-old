					<p>The kernel is a compressed blob in flash as the first part of the firmware partition.&nbsp; It is not part of a filesystem.&nbsp; The bootloader uncompresses the whole kernel out of flash into RAM then jumps into it.<br />It is not practical to modify at run time.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 14 Jun 2017, 20:07)</p>

After this you can use mkimage can create an u-Image-<br />So the bzImage (with initramfs) on all subtargets are the same.</p><p>On MIPS there some some similar logic with a magic number, because the scheme as on ARM is not upstream (last time I read this code)</p><p>(*)<br />ARM_APPENDED_DTB<br />hmm for MIPS&nbsp; so there is append dtb ??<br />MIPS_NO_APPENDED_DTB</p>									</div>
