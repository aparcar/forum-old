					<p>Hello,</p><p>I just recently joined, mainly to inquire about support for certain routers which were recently released. They are dual band wireless N routers, so I don&#039;t know if openwrt will have support for them soon. I know Atheros based hardware has the most support, on the account of their free software drivers and lack of firmware in relation to ath9k. So I&#039;ll list the ones I was looking at:</p><p>Linksys EA4500 v3:<br /><a href="https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Linksys_EA4500_v3">https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Linksys_EA4500_v3</a></p><p>Netgear WNDR4500 v3:<br /><a href="https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Netgear_WNDR4500v3">https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Netgear_WNDR4500v3</a></p><p>D Link DIR 855L rev A1:<br /><a href="https://wikidevi.com/wiki/D-Link_DIR-855L_rev_A1">https://wikidevi.com/wiki/D-Link_DIR-855L_rev_A1</a></p><p>There&#039;s also the TP Link TL WDR4900, but that&#039;s hard to find in the United States. At least I couldn&#039;t find any on Ebay or Amazon. If anyone has any other suggestions for n900 routers, that would be great, but these are the ones I saw that had Atheros based hardware. The Netgear and Linksys were released within the past year, but the D Link has been out for a couple of years, at least 2013. I believe they all use NAND as their storage solution, so I don&#039;t know if that will cause a problem. Please let me know if anything can be done.</p>									</div>

I&#039;ve already explored the wiki for these models and it seems they haven&#039;t been updated for the most latest versions of these routers. It makes sense, since according to wikidev, they were released within the past few months; but I thank you for your advice.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>drawz wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>In theory, it&#039;s possible, but I don&#039;t think anyone has actually done it yet for these models.</p></blockquote></div><p>Yeah that&#039;s what I was looking for. I even looked at the latest trunk/snapshot, and I couldn&#039;t find any corresponding images. All of these are atheros/qualcomm atheros based so they should wok. Also since they&#039;re ath9k they shouldn&#039;t require any firmware, and the drivers are released under a free software license.</p><p>Is there a generic openwrt build I can download to test these routers, or can I compile openwrt images that will work with these routers? I have Debian Stretch/current testing on my laptop, so I&#039;m no stranger to linux. I don&#039;t have much experience in cross compiling but I am willing to learn, if its not too difficult.</p>									</div>

					<p>Wikidevi indicates the Netgear model stated above (Netgear WNDR4500v3) is the same board as the WNDR4300v2.&nbsp; It&#039;s not clear from the TOH if the v2 is supported by the images for Chaos Calmer rc3.&nbsp; If it were my router I would install the Chaos Calmer WNDR4300 images and start testing to see what did and did not work.</p>									</div>

					<p>Understood. Thank you all. I don&#039;t have the routers yet, I just wanted to confirm before purchasing. These appear to be the highest performing N routers available.</p><p>One last question, the 4 listed above, minus the tp-link, come with 128 mb of nand memory. Is there any benefit to this or any downside? I&#039;ve read that openwrt has had trouble with nand memory before.</p>									</div>

					<p>NAND support is fairly new but seems to be working properly on routers that have been set up to do so. Most people don&#039;t need that much storage space on their router, so it usually doesn&#039;t add much.</p>									</div>

					<p>I just got a wndr4500v3 in that has a bad wan port. I opened it up and serial headers are already in. <br />The router is running the latest netgear firmware for it. <br />Guess what?&nbsp; Putty busybox shows it is Kamikaze r18571.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Malachi</strong> on 13 Aug 2016, 00:37)</p>
