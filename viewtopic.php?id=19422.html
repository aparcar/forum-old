					<p>Hi guys!<br />I have a Siemens SE515 and wanted to play and test with OpenWrt (I know the router is not fully supported). I have bought a data cable which I wanted to use for the RS232 connector on the board, but I also need a connector so that I can use the cable. I have no idea how this connector is called or where to buy it. It is sometimes used by old cd drives to connect them to the soundcard.<br />I have attached a picture of it. It is not very good, sorry, but I do not have a better camera at the moment.<br /><a href="http://img22.imageshack.us/img22/3439/img0001hla.jpg">the image</a><br />I hope someone can help me<br />thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>It looks like the same connector used on a DNS-3232 NAS for serial comms. The suggested connector and pins for this are from Digikey,<br />Digikey WM1722-ND female housing and WM1775-ND pins. They are also available from RS Components as the manufacturer is Molex, housing 51021-0400, RS Partnumber is 279-9162 for the housing. Receptacle Molex 50058-8000, RS don&#039;t do the raw receptacle. You could also try <a href="http://www.farnell.com">www.farnell.com</a></p>									</div>

					<p>You can use also the connectors of the led&#039;s/speaker that have connected to the old motherboard, the external pc speaker connector have the 4 pins that you need.</p>									</div>

					<p>As I cannot recognize anything on your photo, I can only guess what type of connector is has. If it has the standard 1/10&quot; pin spacing, a regular floppy disk drive power connector will fit.</p>									</div>

					<p>The SE515 has a 2mm pinout, it&#039;s not a 2,54 mm one. So the motherboard plugs won&#039;t work here.</p><p>I took a 5-pin plug I had once bought at Reichelt.de, cut off the leftmost pin, took out the second pin (I don&#039;t need power anyways) and the rest fit into the header. Seems there are no 4-pin 2mm plugs?&nbsp; I&#039;ve only seen 3- and 5-pin plugs at first view.</p>									</div>
