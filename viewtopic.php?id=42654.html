					<p>I am trying to use arecord to record my microphone, and I would like to record in mp3 or ogg or whatever so the file size wont take up my 4gb flash drive so quickly. I tried piping it but I keep getting a overrun, and IDK if its because its using too much cpu usage or what.</p><p>This is the command I have tried arecord -f cd -t raw | lame -x -r test.mp3</p><p>I have tried different switchs, and by switches I mean -x for example. </p><p>I was also thinking of doing this, when it records I would have it time stamped, and after it records for lets say 10 seconds, I would encode it in cd quality. But I would like to keep recording while its encoding the previous time stamped mp3.</p><p>Either or if someone can help me.</p>									</div>

					<p>mp3 encoding is very cpu intensive, you probably can&#039;t do it in real time on your router. Just did a quick test; on my WNR3500L encoding a 10s wav file took 150s.</p><p>EDIT: To lower the wav file sizes you could record a single channel with lower quality.</p><p>For single channel cd quality:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>arecord -f S16_LE -r 44100</code></pre></div><p>Lower quality:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>arecord -f S16_LE -r 22050</code></pre></div><p>Even lower:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>arecord -f S8 -r 22050</code></pre></div><p>Each should be half the size of the previous.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ipha</strong> on 4 Mar 2013, 02:37)</p>
