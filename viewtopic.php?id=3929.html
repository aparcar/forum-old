					<p>Hi,</p><p>it&#039;s not possible for me to establish a reliable connection via WDS/WPA-PSK between two WRT54G&#039;s, both running WhiteRussian RC4.</p><p>At the beginning, if I reboot both routers, the connection remains stable for about one day. But afterwards, there&#039;s a packet loss of about 50%, and later on, the connection is fully broken until I manually run &quot;wifi up&quot;.</p><p>The memory utilization is increasing steadily - after an uptime of circa 3 days, I&#039;m not able to simply re-establish the connection by issuing &quot;wifi up&quot;, because the nas-daemon stopped running. I also can see that there are 4 /sbin/hotplug processes running when this happens.</p><p>Killing all the running hotplug processes, restarting nas with &quot;/etc/init.d/S41wpa&quot; and issuing &quot;wifi up&quot; sometimes results in the following syslog entries:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[...]
