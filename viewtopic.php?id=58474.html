					<p>hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve recently rescued a Linksys WAG354 from electronic waste.&nbsp; I want to install OpenWrt on it, and I&#039;m having a few problems.</p><p>The router was working, but with Linksys&#039;s firmware, which had limited functionality. I successfully upgraded the router with modded firmware, Neptune354. This enabled a lot of the functionality originally disabled. </p><p>My next step is to install OpenWrt. And I&#039;m hitting problems. The web interface is not accepting the firm ware image, from its&#039; web utility. I changed the Va31 image file name to upgrade_code.bin (as this seems to be what&#039;s need to get the Neptune firmware to be accepted. </p><p>I tried with TFTP. Using a utility from Linksys (I&#039;m using Windows for my laptop , no command line TFTP). </p><p>I&#039;ve looked at the old threads for my router. I&#039;m not sure if they&#039;re relevant. They had suggestions for making the binary from source files, with fixes.&nbsp; Is that relevant, in that are the binaries online working, and not in need of fixes. </p><p>Why might the web utility of the Linksys be rejecting the binary as an upgrade?</p><p>Supposedly, there is a TFTP window when the router starts up, 1 second.&nbsp; I&#039;ve played around with switching it off and on, then clicking the gui to send firmware TFTP. But I&#039;m getting no response from the server. </p><p>Is there another way I can get the image on the router?&nbsp; &nbsp;I can telnet into it now after the Neptune mod, but I&#039;m not sure what I&#039;m looking for.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve just enabled TFTP on my windows machine. I intend to TFTP an OW binary onto the Linksys from the command line. </p><p>I&#039;m able to telnet onto the linsys......But I&#039;m not sure how to navigate it. Where the current firmware image is, and what I should to. Should I target the existing firmware with the TFTP?</p>									</div>

					<p>I also own one of those. I managed to install OpenWRT some time ago, but it was very unstable. Perhaps newer versions work better, but last time I checked, there were severe memory limitations with that device. I think there was a post around here, about a custom image.</p>									</div>
