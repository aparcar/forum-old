					<p>My goal is to only run it as a music streamer.&nbsp; I would like to be able to control it via the network as shown in the how-to video, and I also want to try and setup pulseaudio on it to play rtp.&nbsp; For this to work, I do not think I need the bridge...in fact, why did the how-to author put his into bridged mode?</p><p>I went back and copied my config files exactly, here is a more detailed explanation of what I changed.&nbsp; As mentioned in my first post here is the how-to I am trying to follow: <a href="http://www.tinkernut.com/archives/2387#!prettyPhoto">http://www.tinkernut.com/archives/2387#!prettyPhoto</a></p><p>I am using the following openwrt build: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03/brcm47xx/openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … uashfs.trx</a></p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I am trying to get my router to connect to my home wifi network which is a linksys wrt54gl running tomato setup with:<br />ssid=home<br />security type=wpa2,passphrase,AES<br />key=helloSweet!<br />channel=5<br />ip address=192.168.1.1</p><br /><p>So, When I ssh into my newly flashed openwrt Asus router and open the /etc/config/wireless file I see this:</p><p>Original:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>wireless:

        option mode     ap

					<p>FIXED!</p><p>well after following the tutorial several times and not having any luck, I wondered whether using the official firmware from here: <a href="http://mightyohm.com/blog/2008/11/building-a-wifi-radio-part-4-installing-openwrt/">http://mightyohm.com/blog/2008/11/build … g-openwrt/</a></p><p>So why would that custom build make all the difference?&nbsp; having seen the color of the air light when connected, I think that the router was not connecting properly to my wireless network (though i followed the same directions just with a new firmware)</p>									</div>
