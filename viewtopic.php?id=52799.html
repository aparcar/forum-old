					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I just finished my IPv6 stack on OpenWRT Barrier Braker 14.07-rc3. I&#039;m facing a small problem that I could not find for a solution here in the forums or the wikis: OpenWRT gives me no RA for IPv6 only DNS resolution.</p><p>First, how the problem materializes itself from any machine in the IPv6 /64 subnet of the OpenWRT:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>$ dig ipv6.br aaaa

It doesn&#039;t matter if they are the OpenWRT&#039;s DNS server or a public one. Here is how I configured it:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config dhcp &#039;lan&#039;
        option interface &#039;lan&#039;
        option ra &#039;server&#039;
        option start &#039;1&#039;
        option leasetime &#039;24h&#039;
        option limit &#039;28&#039;
        list dns &#039;2001:4860:4860::8888&#039;
        list dns &#039;2001:4860:4860::8844&#039;
        list domain &#039;local&#039;
        option dhcpv6 &#039;server&#039;
        option ra_management &#039;1&#039;</code></pre></div><p>According to the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network6#barrier.breaker.and.later">wiki</a>, Barrier Braker has integrated some IPv6 mechanisms including RA (formerly provided by radvd). I thought that install radvd package is not necessary because I&#039;m also sure that netifd/odhcpd are advertising the IPv6 network prefix and route correctly, so I didn&#039;t. What I&#039;m not getting are the (supposedly) advertised IPv6 DNS servers and I have no clue why is that.</p><p>Am I doing something wrong here? Did I faced a bug? Can somebody help me to figure this out?</p><p>Best,</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>denydias</strong> on 18 Sep 2014, 10:04)</p>

					<p>Maybe as a hint: your host might still try to resolve IPv6 addresses using the IPv4-DNS server. This is normally not problematic (e.g. try: dig ipv6.google.com AAAA @8.8.8.8) but maybe there is an issue with your partivular IPv4 DNS-server so it doesn&#039;t work with it and causes problems. Maybe adjusting your upstream IPv4 DNS to one of the Google DNS servers might do the trick.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi CyrusFF,</p><p>The LAN DNS server is the OpenWrt itself. It resolves just fine over IPv4 and IPv6.</p><p>The reason it&#039;s not working on IPv6 is what almost driving me crazy here. DHCPv6 clients (tested on Mac) did get the OpenWrt IPv6 IP as the DNS resolver for IPv6 and any dig -6 resolution works great.</p><p>But when on Linux with NetworkManager and automatic IPv6 configuration (both RA or DHCPv6), /etc/resolv.conf managed by NM always looks like this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># Generated by NetworkManager
domain local
search local
nameserver 192.168.1.1</code></pre></div><p>It doesn&#039;t matter what settings are in place at OpenWrt for additional DNSs... NM will always and only show the OpenWrt IPv4 address for the nameserver entry.</p><p>I was fiddling with this on OpenWrt to see if I could workaround NM issues and once, and only for once, I&#039;ve got this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># Generated by NetworkManager
domain local
search local
nameserver 192.168.1.1
nameserver 2001:xxxx:xxxx::1</code></pre></div><p>And that worked great! Then I changed the same settings back to their defaults to verify that the trick was done, apply, set the ones that gave me the above results again, apply. For my complete surprise, the NM generated resolv.conf back to IPv4 only and never went back to the working configuration, no matter what I did on dnsmasq settings.</p><p>The settings in place when it worked for this only time was:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># cat /tmp/etc/dnsmasq.conf 
# auto-generated config file from /etc/config/dhcp
conf-file=/etc/dnsmasq.conf
dhcp-authoritative
domain-needed
no-resolv
localise-queries
read-ethers
bogus-priv
expand-hosts
domain=local
server=/local/
server=8.8.8.8
server=2001:4860:4860::8844
dhcp-leasefile=/tmp/dhcp.leases
addn-hosts=/tmp/hosts
conf-dir=/tmp/dnsmasq.d
stop-dns-rebind
rebind-localhost-ok
rebind-domain-ok=macpress.com.br
dhcp-broadcast=tag:needs-broadcast</code></pre></div><p>So, my poor workaround for this was:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>$ ls -la /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/10-ipv6dns
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 66 Set 18 17:29 /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/10-ipv6dns

$ cat /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/10-ipv6dns
#!/bin/sh
echo &quot;nameserver 2001:xxxx:xxxx::1&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/resolv.conf</code></pre></div><p>I&#039;m stuck in here. My white hairs have increased quite a lot these last couple days! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>Best,</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>denydias</strong> on 19 Sep 2014, 00:05)</p>

					<p>Well, NetworkManager and RA RDNSS annoucements are a no go. I&#039;m thinking I was seeing ghosts when it worked that one time only.</p><p>So, I made my NM dispatcher script a bit better.

        #Subnet Check
        NETMASK=&quot;192.168.1.0/24&quot;
        if [ -n &quot;`/sbin/ip addr show $IF to $NETMASK`&quot; ]; then
                echo &quot;# Set by NetworkManager dispatcher&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/resolv.conf
                echo &quot;nameserver 2001:1234:abcd::1&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/resolv.conf
                exit $?
        fi
