					<p>Hi,</p><p>In the release notes you can read:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[...] strongswan are outdated. If you intend to use either of them please update the packages using the snapshots repository: https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/</code></pre></div><p>As I realized it is not possible anymore to install the strongswan packages with opkg anymore. So if strongswan is outdated what is the suggestion to use instead for building IPSEC VPNs with openwrt?</p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>inquisitor</strong> on 17 Jun 2015, 21:49)</p>

					<p>The StrongSwan and OpenSSL versions included in CC RC2 have known security vulnerabilities. Updates for both are already in place in respective branches, so the packages will be updated when the next RC or final is built. Just wait for the next build, or build your own image from the CC branch if you like.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, makro.<br />I already tried to build my own image from source using &quot;git clone git://git.openwrt.org/openwrt.git&quot;. The build works fine and the image is running properly. However the strongswan packages are not available with my own image too.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>inquisitor</strong> on 18 Jun 2015, 21:36)</p>

					<p>StrongSwan currently doesn&#039;t build with musl-libc, which is the default libc in trunk. You can build your image with uClibc to get a working StrongSwan, in menuconfig you can change it under Advanced options, Toolchain options, C library. I can confirm StrongSwan builds in trunk using uClibc.</p><p>The CC branch still uses uClibc as default, so you can build from that instead: git://git.openwrt.org/15.05/openwrt.git. Some build hardening features were recently enabled in trunk, I don&#039;t know how well tested StrongSwan is with those features. These features are not enabled by default in CC. As I said StrongSwan builds, but that doesn&#039;t mean it won&#039;t have runtime problems.</p><p>Make sure to do <strong>make dirclean</strong> before doing any of the suggested changes, as you will need to rebuild the toolchain.</p>									</div>
