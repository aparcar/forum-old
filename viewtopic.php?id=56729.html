					<p>See the config files for the Secondary router in <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=56231">this thread</a> for an example of how i did it (although i used another OpenWrt router for the DHCP/Router functions).</p><p>It shouldn&#039;t be too hard for you to modify it for your needs.</p>									</div>

					<p>heureka<br />it was pretty simple in the end.<br />the problem was my old GS108Tv1. the config is rather awkward. i now ordered a cisco 300-10.</p><p>1) config sophos utm 9.2<br />i configured a free 1g/bit port with two new vlans 100,200 inkl dhcp, dns, fwrules,...<br />and connected the openwrt tp link wr841n v9 directly with a lan port, not the wan port.</p><p>2) config openwrt<br />then i configured 2 new dhcp interfaces, one on eth0.100 and another on eth0.200,<br />and moved both to the internal firewall zone.<br />in addition i uncheckt &#039;this is the only dhcp&#039; in systems dialog</p><p>3) config openwrt<br />now i added vlan 100 and 200 as new vlans to the switch<br />and tagged, the cpu and the connected lan port, with both vlans<br />(now i had to connect to one of the default gateways ip of the new dhcp, of course)<br />suddenly both interfaces got a correct ip from the dhcp&#039;s.</p><p>4) config openwrt<br />now, i configured two new wlan&#039;s, one for each new dhcp interface.<br />now, both wlan&#039;s are working correctly.<br />all wifi clients getting ip&#039;s from sophos dhcp.<br />because of the fwrules on the sophos, one wlan has no connection to a internal devices, just the connection to the internet works.<br />i even can throttle the throughput for the wlan&#039;s separately by configure it on the sophos utm</p><p>all config for openwrt are done with LuCI web user interface.</p><p>thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>news4nd</strong> on 21 Apr 2015, 13:03)</p>
