					<p>Hi Raver!</p><p>I used sqashfs for the working and non working firmware.</p><p>Before the last flash, the asus router was configured as wlan client for my other fritz!box router. Even with WPA. And it seems that it still connects even and only with WPA! I can see it in the protocol of the fritz!box with timestamp. And I can also see in the fritz!box, that it usually gets the IP 192.168.1.1. But at the moment the protocol shows no IP for the asus anymore. My other WLAN client still shows up with IP.</p><p>I already had &quot;bad&quot; experience with flashing with this asus before, but it did behave better before:<br />1. Had original asus firmware 1.9.6.7<br />2. Tried to flash Standard-Openwrt-squashfs. Error. No(?) flashing Power LED ping -t 192.168.1.1 shows connection for at least one time after power cycle<br />3. Flashed original asus firmware 1.9.6.9.&nbsp; Successfui.<br />4. Flashed Standard-Openwrt-squashfs again. Successfui.<br />5. Flashed Own firmware. Error. Power LED flashing slowly. ping does not show any connection wired or wireless anymore</p><p>What should I do now? Any ideas?</p><p>Best regards</p><p>Thorsten</p>									</div>

					<p>Had the same problem last week. It seems that you should not use the webinterface for flashing a router as it seems to be not safe.</p>									</div>
