					<p>Hi, I flashed my wrt45gl to white russian x-wrt image, and everything went fine. I have a 5mb/5mb VDSL line and as I expected DL is ok, but when it comes tu UL it goes just upto 1/2 mb , that is cca 55kb/sec, I reconnected it directly and line is fine about 500kb/sec upload, but when I do it via router it is just 50kbs, I do not use QOS or something else. Where can I start fixing the problem!</p><p>tnx<br />JeDo</p>									</div>

					<p>I have encountered a similar problem using the OpenWRT WhiteRussian 0.9 x-wrt image on my Linksys WRTSL54GS.</p><p>My ISP, Qwest, Advertises a 1536 kbps down, 896 kbps up connection.&nbsp; My DSL Modem indicates that it has a 1536/896 connection. Now, if one allows 15% for overhead, I should see 1305 kbps down and 761 kbps up when communicating with devices over the internet.</p><p>I noticed that when I had my WRTSL54GS OpenWRT box between my PC and the DSL Modem, I would get 1289/464 kbps on average.&nbsp; I checked out the QOS setting in /etc/config/qos:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/etc/config/qos

# INTERFACES:
config interface wan
        option classgroup  &quot;Default&quot;
        option enabled      0
        option upload       512
        option download     3072

       ...</code></pre></div><p>Ah ha!&nbsp; Taking 15% overhead off of a 512 kbps up connection would be about 464 kbps.&nbsp; So, I matched my ISP&#039;s advertised rates:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/etc/config/qos

# INTERFACES:
config interface wan
        option classgroup  &quot;Default&quot;
        option enabled      0
        option upload       896
        option download     1536

       ...</code></pre></div><p>That fixed my upload problem.&nbsp; I could send data at 760 kbps, but I could only receive data at an average of 904 kbps.&nbsp; After testing different QOS configurations, I found for my ISP&#039;s advertised rates, the QOS settings of 3072/896 worked best so that out of my 1536/896 connection I get an average 1258/635 kbps connection to various servers with a maximum transfer rate of 1312/760 kbps to my ISP, very close to a 15% drop due to overhead.&nbsp; So, if anyone is still reading, my final settings for Qwest&#039;s 1536/896 package are:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/etc/config/qos

# INTERFACES:
config interface wan
        option classgroup  &quot;Default&quot;
        option enabled      0
        option upload       896
        option download     3072

       ...</code></pre></div>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bkloppenborg</strong> on 29 Aug 2007, 07:15)</p>
