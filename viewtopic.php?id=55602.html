					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am new to OpenWRT and new to the forum, so first a hello to all!<br />I have got an TP Link MR3040 with Barrier Breaker. I need to read the state of the Hardware switch. In the documentation, I find, that I should export the buttons with </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>echo 19 &gt; /sys/class/gpio/export</code></pre></div><p>as an result I get the following error message:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ash: write error: Device or resource busy</code></pre></div><p>If I try with:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>echo 6 &gt; /sys/class/gpio/export</code></pre></div><p>It is working. But in the /sys/class/gpio directory I only can find gpio18 and gpiochip0 (and also because of my testing gpio6).<br />Where can I fund the usage of GPIO19 and 20? Or is there another way to read the state of the switch? Without hotplug, I do not need to get an interupt when the switch state changes, I onla want to read once the state of the switch.</p><p>Thanks for your help,</p><p>Sven</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you, after unloading the module, it worked fine. But after a reboot, the exported states are lost again. I ask now google, how to unload the button module permanently. Thanks a lot, looks like I am now on the right way. And the information from the /sys/kernel/debug/gpio is not what I am loocking for. I need the state of the variables after boot, because i want to start with different configurations linked to /etc/config. And I have no idea about regular expressions, and how i can get the information from this place to a variable I can use in a script.</p><p>Greetings and thank you,</p><p>Sven</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, thank you, but it would have one big disadvantage, I would do something that I do not understand ;-) But I realize in the moment, that i do not understand the hotplugin also. I removed it from /etc/modules.d/ after reboot it was still loaded, I found it in /etc/modules-boot.d, removed it htere, and after reboot the module was again loaded. I uninstalled kmod-gpio-button-hotplug and after reboot, guess what...<br />So I think I try it with your script, and maybe it is for me the start for learning regular expressions. After 15 years of Lniux, maybe now it is the rigth time.</p><p>Greetings,</p><p>Sven</p>									</div>

					<p>Modules that are compiled into the kernel always load at boot.&nbsp; You will need to either compile a new kernel (not really recommended for something this simple) or use the init script to explicitly unload it. (modprobe -r)</p>									</div>

					<p>That explains why I can not unload that module. I think I will either unload it, or try the regular expression from metai. <br />Thnaks,</p><p>Sven</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your help. With your help here I managed it now. <br />I worked more or less with this description: <br /><a href="http://www.martinmelchior.be/2014/11/configure-your-wr703n-with-switch-or-two.html">http://www.martinmelchior.be/2014/11/co â€¦ r-two.html</a><br />I only changed the script in the beginning for unloading the kernel module, and I have without oldering only 3 states for the switches, and not four.
