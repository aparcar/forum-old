					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am trying to figure out if it is possible to implement jumbo-frames on this device. As far as I can see from the datasheets of switch rtl8266sr and<br />the ar7100 (7141) controller larger packets is supported by the hardware.</p><p>So far I have done adjustments in rtl8366s.c and ag71xx.h/ag71xx_main.c, but without luck so far. There is a limitation somewhere<br />allowing 1536 bytes L2 MTU for RX and 1514 bytes L2 MTU for TX (excl. FCS). Adjusting buffers/registers of the hardware does not help.</p><br /><p>Do anyone have any information about this, should it be doable or is there anything in the hardware/implementation which makes this impossible ?<br />Any information is very welcome.</p><br /><p>Thank you,</p><br /><p>PerHan</p>									</div>
