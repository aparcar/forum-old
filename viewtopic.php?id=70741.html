					<p>Hi all!</p><p>I would really appreciate your help.</p><p>My friend doesn&#039;t have an option to get internet access at his house, but his neighbour who is also his cousin said he can share his. His cousin has a WRT54GL (192.168.1.1, DHCP) running Tomato connected to a PPPoE modem. He had a spare WRT54GL which we connected via lan cable (192.168.1.2, DHCP disabled, setup as AP) on a window facing my friends house.</p><p>My friend has a big antenna on his house connected via lan cable to WAN port of his TP-Link TL-WR741ND router (192.168.1.3, DHCP disabled, setup as wireless client).</p><p>The SSID can be seen via wireless survey on the TP-Link so the antenna works, but the internet doesn&#039;t work. What am I missing? TP-Link is running stock firmware. Thinking of installing OpenWrt.</p><p>My friend would like to use the TP-Link for wired (ps4) and wireless clients (mobile phones, notebook)</p><p>Any help appreciated!</p>									</div>

					<p>If the TP link stock firmware supports wireless client you should be OK except that...</p><p>You have to use a different subnet for your LAN, such as 192.168.2.1&nbsp; Set the TP-Link to 192.168.2.1, disconnect / reboot everything, then see if you have Internet.&nbsp; The WAN interface should pull a 192.168.1.X address from the other house via DHCP.&nbsp; Also it will set the gateway to 192.168.1.1, the gateway at the other house.</p><p>If not, install OpenWrt on the TP Link and go from there.&nbsp; Process is the same including the need to use different subnets.</p><p>You don&#039;t need to do any special configuration at the AP to be a routed client.&nbsp; You only need to be in radio range and know the password.&nbsp; Any router, even with stock firmware, will work as the source end of the link.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 26 Apr 2017, 22:01)</p>

					<p>The WRT-54GL only has 16 MB RAM, which simply is too small (discontinued with Barrier Breaker in 2012). Only extremely targetted/ stripped down (custom) builds would have a chance to boot at all and even there the end is in sight.</p>									</div>

					<p>I managed to install Gargoyle on the TP-Link but didn&#039;t get any further.</p><p>1. main router WRT54GL connected to the PPPoE modem in the neigbours house:<br />WAN: enabled, PPPoE<br />IP 192.168.1.1,<br />DHCP enabled<br />Wireless enabled, but these settings are irelevant for our situation</p><p>2. extension router WRT54GL connected to the main router via lan cable in lan port,<br />WAN disabled<br />IP 192.168.1.2<br />DHCP disabled. <br />Wireless enabled, (which mode to choose, tomato gives following options: Access Point, Access Point + WDS, Wireless Client, Wireless ethernet bridge, WDS?</p><p>3.

					<p>Routed client is probably what you want because it will firewall your stuff from the network in the other house.</p><p>If you were using OpenWrt it is simple to set up, just replace the default wired WAN connection with a wifi client interface.&nbsp; Make sure the WAN network is not a bridge.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, i didn&#039;t have time to work on his routers there, so I took routers 2 and 3 to my home. Which means I can&#039;t test it with the big antenna on WAN port. My home router has the same setup as his neighbours primary (192.168.1.1).</p><p>How should I set up router 2 wireless? as an access point? </p><p>And router 3 since it has no WAN connected, should temporarily have it&#039;s WiFi setup as routed client and thus be temporarily only available for wired clients if i understood correctly?</p>									</div>

					<p>There are of course a few different ways to do this.&nbsp; For the first attempt, I suggest a routed client.</p><p>Router 1 (connected to ISP) -- conventional router<br />Router 2 (wired to router 1, will be the source of your radio link) -- conventional AP<br />Router 3 (wireless link to Router 2) -- conventional client interface to router 2. This interface is your &quot;wan&quot; network.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Your router (3) WAN interface is DHCP client, it obtains a DHCP address from router 1. The LAN section of Router 3 routes Internet requests through to Router 1, as if it were your ISP.</p>									</div>

					<p>No, any time you&#039;re going to use routing so several &quot;private&quot; devices each with a LAN IP can share one IP connection to the Internet, you have to use separate ranges.</p>									</div>
