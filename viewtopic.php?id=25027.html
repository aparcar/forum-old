					<p>I recently bought 2 FR-54RTR and loaded OpenWRT 10.03 on them.&nbsp; I installed the iperf package on them and ran several tests.&nbsp; I&#039;m confused by the results and was hoping someone could shed some light on my problem.</p><p>Here is the network:<br />PC--oWRT1--OWRT2</p><p>The PC is connected to oWRT via a LAN interface.&nbsp; The 2 oWRTs are connected to each other via a LAN interface also. I run the following tests:</p><p>PC iperf to oWRT1 iperf: passes with ~92Mbps<br />PC iperf to oWRT2 iperf: passes with ~89Mbps<br />oWRT1 iperf to oWRT2 iperf: test never completes, link between oWRT1 and oWRT2 stops working.I have to reset both routers for the interface to start working again.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t understand why the 2 routers can handle the traffic in the PC test but not in the router to router test.&nbsp; Any ideas on why this problem occurs?</p>									</div>

					<p>If you run iperf on the router directly, it might overload the cpu and thus trigger the watchdog which will reset the device.<br />You should run iperf on a host behind each router to get reliable throughput measurements.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t believe it is resetting because the management interface (ssh &amp; web) still work.&nbsp; Could it be that the switch chip (or switch portion of the chip... I don&#039;t know if this device uses 2 separate chips) is reset but the CPU is not?&nbsp; </p><p>I&#039;m trying to create cheap test end points so the iperf functionality is actually more important to me than regular routing functionality.&nbsp; I&#039;ll look into the watchdog settings to see if any of them make a difference.&nbsp; I cannot wrap my head around the fact that PC--oWRT2 is more stressful than oWRT1--oWRT2.&nbsp; It seems to me that oWRT2 gets the same load either way.</p>									</div>
