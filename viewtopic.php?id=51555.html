					<p>I ran into some problems running ntpd in Attitude Adjustment.&nbsp; The&nbsp; problem turned out to be that ntpclient was using port 123 to make an outgoing connection to ntp servers on the internet rather than an ephemeral port.&nbsp; The effect of this was to prevent ntpd from binding to port 123 (to listen for ntp client connects in the local lan).&nbsp; The &quot;fix&quot; was as follows:<br />open the file /etc/hotplug.d/iface/20-ntpclient in vi (or other editor)<br />Go to the section that looks like this:<br />start_ntpclient() {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; config_foreach set_drift ntpdrift<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; config_foreach check_server ntpserver<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [ -z &quot;$SERVER&quot; ] &amp;&amp; exit 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; logger starting ntpclient<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $NTPC ${COUNT:+-c $COUNT} ${INTERVAL:+-i $INTERVAL} -s -l -D -p $PORT -h $SERVER 2&gt; /dev/null<br />}<br />and remove the &quot;-p $PORT&quot; in the line near the end.&nbsp; The line should now read:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $NTPC ${COUNT:+-c $COUNT} ${INTERVAL:+-i $INTERVAL} -s -l -D&nbsp; -h $SERVER 2&gt; /dev/null</p><p>This causes ntpclient to use an ephemeral port for outbound connections to ntp servers on the internet.<br />This may not be a &quot;good&quot; fix but it allows me run ntpd (and ntpclient).&nbsp; <br />Thanks to all concerned who contribute to OpenWrt.</p>									</div>
