					<p>Starting a new thread in the hope of recovering my device...</p><p>I managed to get Open WRT working on my A5-V11, and have lost it again. I either set an admin password in the Web UI or hard reset it at some point.</p><p>Now when you turn it on the LED glows red. Holding the reset button for 10 seconds results in both the Blue and Red LEDs lighting up. But the router doesn&#039;t show up in the DHCP tables on my home router or respond to telnet over ethernet. Any ideas? I&#039;d love to recover it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi. Yes I was able to recover with fail safe mode <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>It turned out I had bridged the ethernet adapter and set a router IP on a different subnet that I didn&#039;t recall, thus making it nearly impossible to log in.</p><p>First I was able to access via Telnet after sniffing out the router subnet and guessing the IP. High excitement to see the CLI interface come up (meaning no brick)!</p><p>From there I factory reset the router, and after that I used fail-safe mode too for a second soft brick that I achieved.</p><p>A good learning experience.</p><p>Happy to help DonJuane if you need it still.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks I do still need it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am traveling at the moment and am in a city away from the router and I hope to be back in my home within two weeks and I will begin the process then.&nbsp; THANK YOU!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>DonJuane</strong> on 19 Feb 2018, 05:59)</p>
