					<p>I just went through this myself, so here&#039;s how to do it. First, you&#039;re going to need an ar71xx device as it&#039;s the only package they vendor has created, and at this point it&#039;s only for Barrier Breaker 14.07. I&#039;m assuming that you now have in your possession such a device, with a USB port, and it&#039;s been minimally configured with a new root password, all other settings left blank. You&#039;ll need an internet connection to start with. I did this using a combination of terminal and web interface.</p><p>First, SSH to your device.<br />run opkg update to get the latest package information.<br />Run opkg install <a href="http://www.mobile-stream.com/beta/easytether_0.8.1-1_ar71xx.ipk">http://www.mobile-stream.com/beta/easyt â€¦ ar71xx.ipk</a><br />It will also install the tun/tap driver along with it.</p><p>Plug in your Android phone with the Easytether software. The Android phone should have debugging enabled (usually done through the system setup - the easytether app will have some walkthroughs). Enable the USB connection on the Easytether software.<br />cd /usr/bin<br />easytether-usb<br />It will then make the connection to your phone. On my phone, at least, every single time it prompts that device with GUID &lt;guid&gt; wants to make a connection - Allow? and select yes. It will then finish the connection.<br />The software has now created an easytether-tap device.</p><p>On the web interface of your OpenWRT device, go to Network--&gt;Interfaces<br />Add a new interface, and give it a name like Easytether.<br />Select the easytether-USB, and protocol DHCP Client. Apply and Save.<br />Now that it&#039;s saved, go back into the interfaces, and edit your Easytether interface. Go to the Firewall Settings tab. Edit it so that the easytether interface is now part of the WAN firewall zone. Save it.</p><p>Your devices behind the OpenWRT now work like a champ. When you need to reconnect, the only step to be done is to the:<br />cd /usr/bin<br />easytether-usb</p><p>portion of it.</p><p>Additionally, if you don&#039;t want to leave your SSH session on, you can use the &quot;screen&quot; program to have a &quot;disconnected&quot; shell session that will run in the background. To do that,</p><p>opkg install screen<br />screen<br />cd /usr/bin<br />easytether-usb</p><p>And then press &lt;Ctrl+A&gt; and then press &lt;Ctrl+D&gt; in rapid succession to disconnect. To reconnect if you&#039;d like, screen -r.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Aeschulus</strong> on 10 Feb 2015, 17:18)</p>
