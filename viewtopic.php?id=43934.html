					<p>Hello, is it possible to share usb device with openwrt? I&#039;d like to have direct access to the USB hardware keylock from the network same as it would be directly attached to the computer.</p><p>The client is windows machine, so it would require some driver too on windows side. I&#039;m using rs232 lan server and it works quite fine, I was wondering if it is possible to share USB as well.</p><p>I&#039;d prefer openwrt based solution, because I have wr842nd and wr1043nd boxes running openwrt with spare USB ports, but I&#039;d not mind to buy another device, if it would work, so if there&#039;s some non-openwrt device you can recommend, I&#039;d like to hear about it too.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
