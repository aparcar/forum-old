					<p>Hi All</p><p>I&#039;m wondering what options are available to configure remote management of OpenWRT purely via LuCI.</p><p>I&#039;ve seen the wiki entry for dropbear, so clearly it&#039;s possible to have one port number for the LAN and another for the WAN. But is that something that can be configured via LuCI ?</p><p>In addition, can you specify that only a certain IP address can remotely manage the router ?</p><p>That box which contains the port number 22 is suspiciously large <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Thanks in advance,</p><p>J</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks tmo</p><p>That&#039;s an interesting thread and I can&#039;t believe it was raised *so* recently without me seeing it or finding it in a search. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>However, it&#039;s different to what I&#039;m trying to do. I need terminal access to the router via the WAN and ideally via a port other than 22. Meanwhile I would like to keep port 22 for terminal access via the LAN, if possible. I also want to limit access on the WAN to a single IP address or a range of addresses. Can I configure any or all of this in LuCI ?</p><p>Or is it essential to modify linux o/s files manually ?</p><p>J</p>									</div>
