					<p>Hey <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>been lurking around for a while, thought I&#039;d try out openWRT on the only router I have spare, which happens to still be in development. Thankfully, the only feature still not completed (DSL) isn&#039;t one I need.</p><p>Anyway, I managed to compile the firmware. The chipset running on these boxes is BCM96384, so I tried uploading one of those to the router, and bricked it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>Again, things play in my favour, I find that the &quot;emergency recovery&quot; system on this belkin is a web interface. None of that mucking around with tftp <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /> </p><p>So essentially, I&#039;m at a point where it&#039;s very easy to upload any firmware I choose onto my box. Which one should I use?</p><p>Not sure what information you&#039;d need other than model number, but if you happen to need more to advise, just let me know <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>thankyou xx</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sammeh</strong> on 23 Oct 2009, 23:37)</p>
