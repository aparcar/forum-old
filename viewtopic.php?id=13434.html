					<p>Hey all,</p><p>I&#039;ve been using OpenWrt WhiteRussian RC5 for almost a year. I&#039;m absolute happy with it, except one thing... A few weeks ago I noticed that my internet connection (DSL) breaks up very often (30-40, or more times a day). Since that I checked the phone line for problems (freq splitter removed or something like that, but I didn&#039;t find any), I was reading the logread&#039;s output, but I saw only these lines:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Nov 17 15:31:58 (none) kern.info pppd[1936]: No response to 1 echo-requests<br />Nov 17 15:31:58 (none) kern.notice pppd[1936]: Serial link appears to be disconnected.<br />Nov 17 15:31:58 (none) kern.info pppd[1936]: Connect time 9.9 minutes.<br />Nov 17 15:31:58 (none) kern.info pppd[1936]: Sent 164200 bytes, received 869373 bytes.<br />Nov 17 15:31:58 (none) kern.warn pppd[1936]: Couldn&#039;t increase MTU to 1500<br />Nov 17 15:31:58 (none) kern.warn pppd[1936]: Couldn&#039;t increase MRU to 1500<br />Nov 17 15:31:58 (none) kern.notice pppd[1936]: Connection terminated.<br />Nov 17 15:32:03 (none) kern.info pppd[1936]: Exit.<br />Nov 17 15:32:06 (none) kern.info pppd[2271]: Plugin rp-pppoe.so loaded.<br />Nov 17 15:32:07 (none) kern.notice pppd[2271]: pppd 2.4.3 started by root, uid 0<br />Nov 17 15:32:07 (none) kern.info pppd[2271]: PPP session is 41021<br />Nov 17 15:32:08 (none) kern.info pppd[2271]: Using interface ppp0<br />Nov 17 15:32:08 (none) kern.notice pppd[2271]: Connect: ppp0 &lt;--&gt; vlan1<br />Nov 17 15:32:08 (none) kern.warn pppd[2271]: Couldn&#039;t increase MTU to 1500<br />Nov 17 15:32:08 (none) kern.warn pppd[2271]: Couldn&#039;t increase MRU to 1500<br />Nov 17 15:32:08 (none) kern.warn pppd[2271]: Couldn&#039;t increase MTU to 1500<br />Nov 17 15:32:08 (none) kern.warn pppd[2271]: Couldn&#039;t increase MRU to 1500<br />Nov 17 15:32:08 (none) kern.notice pppd[2271]: PAP authentication succeeded<br />Nov 17 15:32:08 (none) kern.notice pppd[2271]: PAP authentication succeeded<br />Nov 17 15:32:09 (none) kern.notice pppd[2271]: local&nbsp; IP address XXXXXXXXX<br />Nov 17 15:32:09 (none) kern.notice pppd[2271]: remote IP address XXXXXXXX<br />Nov 17 15:32:09 (none) kern.notice pppd[2271]: primary&nbsp; &nbsp;DNS address XXXXXXXX<br />Nov 17 15:32:09 (none) kern.notice pppd[2271]: secondary DNS address XXXXXXXX<br />Nov 17 15:32:09 (none) kern.info dnsmasq[685]: reading /etc/resolv.conf<br />Nov 17 15:32:09 (none) kern.info dnsmasq[685]: using nameserver XXXXXXXX<br />Nov 17 15:32:09 (none) kern.info dnsmasq[685]: using nameserver XXXXXXXX</p></blockquote></div><p>I&#039;m 100% sure that the OpenWrt is causing the problem, because when I tested the connection for a whole day (directly connected my computer to the modem) It never disconnected. But a few minutes after I replugged the modem to the router, the disconnections came again. </p><p>A few weeks before this problem came up, I was trying to set up OpenVPN on the router, but I cancelled that project and tried to remove all &quot;clues&quot;. May this thing is related to my reconnect problem?</p><p>What could be the solution? Can anyone help me?</p><p>Thanks!<br />Adam</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>adamhee</strong> on 17 Nov 2007, 16:51)</p>
