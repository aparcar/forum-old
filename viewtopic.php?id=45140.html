					<p>Hello, <br />I did some searching here and on the net but surprisingly have not found any info so far in regards to my question.</p><p>The TP Link TL-MR3420 3G/3.75G v1 router seems decent so far and some here have mentioned good notes of it.<br />Due to some PC issues I haven&#039;t been able to try out my E3276 4G USB modem with it yet.<br />Reading the specs it seems this version is not capable of 4G as is, or not at all (?)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://www.tp-link.com/en/products/details/?categoryid=&amp;model=TL-MR3420">http://www.tp-link.com/en/products/deta … =TL-MR3420</a><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;* 4G LTE Modems Compatibility apply to TL-MR3420 Version 2.0 ONLY.&quot;</p><p>Already took it back to the store to see if they have either v2 or the newest model which has the different space-age looking gray case, but this is the only one they have (v1)</p><p>After that intro, the question is, with v1.2, is there any possibility to use a 3rd party firmware such as Rooter/OpenWRT in order to get 4G access, or does it actually work already as-is?<br />Or, is this a hardware limitation such as a missing IC on the board?</p><p>Really hope there is some possibility either now, or down the road to get 4G working with this version.<br />I have some fair skills with soldering. I see there are no JTAG pads, so that&#039;s out. Maybe a small component to add or jumper. If it involves a large SMT IC, that&#039;s out of the question due to only having a basic iron.</p><p>Greatly appreciate any help with this. I think others may be wondering this as well, or in the future will be looking.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the reply.<br />Nice if just a SW limitation. <br />I found the Rooter page earlier and downloaded the FW, just wasn&#039;t clear if it would address my concern. Hope so.</p>									</div>

					<p>Actually I believe there is a hardware limitation.<br />According to the data sheets MR3420 is powered by the AR724X SoC.<br />And that SoC only supports USB 1.1, which is a problem when you are using it with a 4G Modem because USB 1.1 cannot transfer data to and fro the modem at 4G rates.<br />Which means that even though it may recognise the 4G Modem it will probably never hit 4G rates.<br />This is just my theory, it will be good if you can test it out and share the results.</p>									</div>
