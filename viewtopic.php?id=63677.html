					<p>Hi,</p><p>I want to wake up my nas while not on my LAN. I had a previous set up that worked (a stock NBG6716 which had an easy &quot;enable wake on wan&quot; feature.) I&#039;ve recently ugraded to CC15.05.1 and am trying to replicate that feauture.</p><p>plenty of recipes can be found on forum/web. mostly boiling down to:</p><p>1.set up a portforward (7/9 udp) from wan to lan to a pseudo-broadcast ip (....254)<br />2. map pseudo-broadcast to real broadcast with magic incantation:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ip neigh add 10.0.0.254 lladr ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff nud permanent dev br-lan</p><p>this last step can be a bit fidgety, as the arp table can get flushed, and the command will fail when ...254 is already in the arp table. (can&#039;t seem to flush that addr from the table with ip neigh del ...)<br />moreover, mapping any incoming udp on port 9 to a broadcast is plain dirty.</p><p>so, is there a better way to achieve the same functionality.<br />if not, what&#039;s the best to map the ip to the bcast addr<br />rc.local - but only run when the interface changes<br />init.d script - .same problem i think<br />procd - seems to have this feature... but AFAIK it&#039;s undocumented (the relevant page is work-in-progress at best ;)</p><p>thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>undef2</strong> on 26 Mar 2016, 14:47)</p>
