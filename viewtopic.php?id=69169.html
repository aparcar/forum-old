It seems that the speed test does something to disable the VPN. Also, even if I don&#039;t do a speed test, the VPN stops working on its own after some time.

					<p>Thanks a lot for the feedback. I had set auth_retry to &#039;nointeract&#039; last night, but it didn&#039;t seem to make a difference.&nbsp; I have done it once again (just in case) it helps.</p><p>The path to the password file is /etc/openvpn/userpass.txt.&nbsp; It has the following permissions set:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root        1.4K Dec 31 12:35 ca.crt

					<p>Okay, so here&#039;s an update.&nbsp; Changing the permissions seems to have made the OpenVPN session last longer, but it still disconnected with the same message as shown before in the log.&nbsp; In addition, the 802.11n SSID allowed for devices to connect, but stopped allowing Internet connectivity after some time (even though the OpenVPN session was connected).&nbsp; The 802.11ac SSID still allowed for devices to connect and allowed for Internet connectivity.</p><p>I am at a loss as to where to go from here.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>									</div>
