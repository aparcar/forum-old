					<p>I have downloaded the &quot;openwrt-WA21-jffs2-64k-code.bi&quot; file and am having problems uploading the bin file to theWAG54G2&nbsp; Router. I am connecting to the router via an ethernet cable and am using a fixed IP address.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am using the Linksys vendor supplied web interface to do the upload.&nbsp; When I start the upload of the BIN file, the progress bar gets to about 5%, and then an error appears stating &quot;Cannot Upload.&nbsp; Contact Administrator&quot;.</p><p>The router then successfully goes back to using the original Linksys firmware (which is V1.00.19 if that&#039;s of any importance to anyone).</p><p>Can anyone suggest how I get around this error message ?</p><p>Thanks....</p>									</div>

					<p>Disregard the above post please.&nbsp; I just worked out that a Linksys WAG54G2 is not the same hardware as a WAG54G v2.&nbsp; Apparently they are two very different animals.&nbsp; Apparently the WAG54G2 is not support by OPENWRT.</p><p>Thanks anyway .....</p><p>Roy</p>									</div>
