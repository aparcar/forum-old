					<p>I looked through the downloads for the latest stable (Backfire 10.3.1) version of OpenWrt for the Buffalo WZR-HP-AG300H, but I didn&#039;t see any particular downloads for it.&nbsp; It does exist in the bleeding edge, but I was wondering if I just missed the stable or is there not one?</p><p>If there isn&#039;t one what is required to get a stable build published?</p>									</div>

					<p>There is none. What would be needed is backports of trunk model support and a complete rebuild of the distribution.<br />Question is where to draw the line then; if you backport one model then why don&#039;t backport the twenty other missing ones.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the clarification.&nbsp; So for the models that do exist why were they chosen for a pre-build?&nbsp; Was it just the time of the stable being developed?&nbsp; Should I expect a stable to include the WZR-HP-AG300H in the next year?</p>									</div>

					<p>The backfire branch was forked away from trunk almost two years ago, it didn&#039;t receive any major model support updates since then, so it simply lacks the codebase to accomodate for many newer ar71xx devices.<br />The next major release based on current trunk is scheduled for June - so yes, there will be a stable this year.</p>									</div>
