					<p>I would like to configure my router to be a wireless bridge with the<br />following characteristics.</p><p>1. The router connects to an existing access point&nbsp; on the internet<br />and get its configuration via DHCP.</p><p>2. The router acts as an access point for other wireless devices,<br />well as wired connections, on a local network, serving DHCP<br />but also allowing static IPs.&nbsp; It performs NAT to allow local<br />devices to access the internet.</p><p>3. The router runs a web server which is reachable both from<br />the outside&nbsp; (using dyndns) and inside (on the local network).</p><p>I was able to configure the router as a wireless repeater using<br />Kamikaze 7.09 and various HowTos on the openwrt site.&nbsp; However,<br />I couldn&#039;t find descriptions for a setup similar to this one, and I<br />am afraid that it&#039;s not obvious how to do it.&nbsp; The &quot;config route&quot;<br />way seems to work only when the gateway has a static<br />address.&nbsp; Can I get this to work using iptables?<br />Do I have to configure the iptables AFTER I acquire the<br />IP address from the internet access point?</p><p>Thank you for any pointers!</p>									</div>
