					<p>I just purchased Tenda 3G150B router yesterday.&nbsp; As my PTCL Evo was not getting connected, i tried to edit its settings in the server page, but accidentally installed wrong firmware of 3G150M in my router. Now my router is not working. I tried to go back to server page to revert back to original firmware, but its not opening. I am stuck now. Can you tell me how I can reset 3G150B router to its default settings. I pushed the Reset button present in router, but its of no use, as wrong firmware cannot be resetted like this. All lights are showing up so its only firmware problem. Please help me Tenda support, to recover my router.</p>									</div>
