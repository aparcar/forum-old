					<p>The main differences seem to be in that the wireless was moved onto the board itself (so no replacable miniPCI anymore), and a new CPU (Broadcom BR5354@240 Mhz). <br />On the outside, the WAN port was exchanged with the WLAN antenna, so the WAN port is now the right most port. Spotting a V2 seems to be easy by just looking where the antenna is. <br />Besides that, the platform seems to be not much changed, as some at&nbsp; <a href="http://wl500g.info/">AsusForum.NET</a> reported successful flashing of the V2 firmware on the old V1 units, with the expected side effects (= no wireless, and one lan port is now the wan port, while the wan port is now a lan port; but that should be easily fixable by changing some NVRAM variables).</p><p>GPL Sources are already there at ASUS&#039; ftp, found <a href="ftp://ftp.asus.com.tw/pub/ASUS/wireless/WL-500gPV2/GPL_WL500gPv2_2005.zip">here</a>, weighing at almost 270 MB.</p><p>At first glance, it does not seem to be that hard to port openwrt to the V2. And perhaps there are one, two things in the new sources that can be used for the old models.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>KanjiMonster</strong> on 3 Mar 2008, 01:24)</p>
