					<p>Hello everyone. <br />I have OpenWRT&nbsp; Barrier Breaker (r34744) running on a D-Link DIR-600 (HW B2), and decided to do some testing with UPnP. After installing the miniupnpd from opkg (miniupnpd version is 1.6.20110730-6) and trying to start the service, I was getting just usage information and miniupnpd was not starting (obviously).<br />So, after some manual reading and learning miniupnpd config options i was able to determine that the initscript wasn&#039;t creating the <em>istening_ip</em> option in the config file it generates. After takig a look at this particular piece of code in the script (and doing some testing):<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>for iface in ${intiface:-lan}; do
    local ipnet
    network_get_subnet ipnet &quot;$iface&quot; &amp;&amp; {
        echo &quot;listening_ip=$ipnet&quot; &gt;&gt;$tmpconf
    }
done</code></pre></div><p>it was obvious that <em>network_get_subnet</em> wasn&#039;t returning anything.</p><p>After some more testing, i kinda stumbled upon the &quot;solution&quot;: by calling <em>network_get_subnet</em> right after sourcing <em>/lib/functions/network.sh</em>&nbsp; (diff with the changes <a href="http://pastebin.ca/2295225">here</a>), everything works just fine.</p><p>My question is: Why? I wrote some scripts and tried to call a bunch of those network functions from a handfull of different scopes, and it worked everytime.<br />Probably it will be something trivial that&nbsp; I&#039;m missing, but since I don&#039;t have more time to continue reading through the initscript or do more tests right now (or in the next few days), I thought maybe someone here can figure it out.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
