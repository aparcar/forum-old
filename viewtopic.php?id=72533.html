					<p>Hey everyone,</p><p>My goal is to use Cellular as a back up access point. I am close, but I can&#039;t access HTTPS websites over cellular, only HTTP. For example, I can access &quot;<a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>&quot;, but not &quot;<a href="https://example.com">https://example.com</a>&quot;. When I try to access HTTPS websites, I receive this error from my chrome borwser:&nbsp; &quot;ERR_ADDRESS_UNREACHABLE&quot;. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a DNS issue, since I can access http sites using their hostnames. </p><p>Using an ethernet connection, I have no issues accessing HTTPS settings.</p><p>As a side note, I am able to make HTTPS requests when I use libcurl library with some C code. Curl accepts arguments such as certificate directory. So maybe OpenWrt is not using the certificate directory?</p><p>Anyway, here is the output form cell section from &quot;ifconfig&quot; and network config file. Any help would be greatly appreciated as I have been stuck on this issue for a day. </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@device:~# ifconfig

					<p>You seem to mix things.<br />Openwrt does not need any certificates for just routing https traffic as it does not care about the packet contents.</p><p>Your firewall rules in OUTPUT concerns traffic originating from the router itself. Like the libcurl usage<br />Similarly INPUT is about traffic for the router itself.<br />FORWARD would be the iptables chain for traffic from a PC via router to somewhere. Like using browser in PC.</p><p>You have possibly not set the cell interface to wan zone in firewall. Or otherwise set the basic forwarding rules. But strange if http works but https does not.</p><p>Do you have any special settings in firewall? And no http proxy?</p>									</div>
