					<p>I have had the same result on both Barrier Breaker and Attitude Adjustment.&nbsp; My router just starts to reset.&nbsp; You can not recover it or re-flash it.&nbsp; I connected the serial cable and noticed that uboot reports 66C as the processor temp.&nbsp; The fan must be triggered at some lower temp than that but I can not find a way of moving fan threshold in either GUI.&nbsp; </p><p>Once the unit cools for an hour I can use the router again.&nbsp; Anyone else having such problems?</p>									</div>
