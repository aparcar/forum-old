					<p>I have had dd-W** after running for about a year and I needed to set up some port forwards after that the router started locking up when they were used. So I decided to dig into straight open wrt considering I am fairly familiar with linux/iptables. I installed x-wrt 0.9 figured I may need the web if to help out a lil. I got it all configured. The old one is WRT54G v2 and this&nbsp; one with x-wrt is wrt54g v2.2 The problem that I am having is that on the old one I could get 2000 - 2400kbps download by speakeasy/c-net etc... on both AP&#039;s wds links On the new one I get 800 - 1100 kbps at the wds links and 2000 - 2400kbps wireless to the main AP I have verified that all wireless setting are the same and spent a few hours playing with them to improve it with no results. The other AP&#039;s are running MontaVista Linux. </p><p>Any body have any Ideas ???</p><br /><br /><p>############NVRAM###############</p><br /><p>Change Variable&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Current Value&nbsp;
