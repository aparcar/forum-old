					<p>Hi,<br /> I have a OpenWRT newbie question, that I am hoping someone can help with...</p><p>I have a WRT1200ac router that comes with a 128M flash, with the standard CC 15.1 image from the routers OpenWRT page installed. Due to partitioning however it seems to have a “/” partition of only about 23M of which about 15M is free. My intention is to move my basic CLI based Asterisk18 set-up from a respberrypi and NAS / Media streaming from my old NAS by using a 1TB 2.5” USB3 HDD connected to the router with the Samba packages installed which is going to need more storage space, also a swap file could be useful...</p><p>Some how-to&#039;s I have found point to using a USB flash drive as a root.overlay to extend the “/” partition on to the USB drive which I could do. My thinking is that I could use a USB Flash drive connection to the USB2 port for this then USB3 for the storage drive which is slower as it&#039;s a spinning drive. But with how the WRT1200ac is already set-up it seems to have an overlay already (see below)?</p><p>For example the DF comment gives:</p><p>Filesystem&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Size&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Used &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Available &nbsp; &nbsp; Use% &nbsp; &nbsp; Mounted on<br />rootfs&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 23.6M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7.0M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 15.4M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 31% &nbsp; &nbsp; /<br />/dev/root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.5M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.5M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 100% &nbsp; &nbsp; /rom<br />tmpfs&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 251.6M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 648.0K&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 250.9M&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 0% &nbsp; &nbsp; /tmp<br />/dev/ubi0_1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 23.6M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7.0M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 15.4M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 31% &nbsp; &nbsp; /overlay<br />overlayfs:/overlay&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 23.6M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7.0M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 15.4M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 31% &nbsp; &nbsp; /<br />ubi1:syscfg&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 29.6M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 224.0K&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 27.8M&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1% &nbsp; &nbsp; /tmp/syscfg<br />tmpfs&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 512.0K&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 512.0K&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 0% &nbsp; &nbsp; /dev</p><p>So my newbie questions that this creates and that I cannot find answers to are:</p><p>1) Can I set-up a second overlay partition to the USB drive as a secend extension or do I need to move the current one?</p><p>2) If I need to move the existing one how do you do this, as I cannot find an obvious how-to, thus I can assume mount the USB drive and then repoint in fstab + plus somehow update or repoint the apps via sym links maybe?</p><p>3) How “read and writey” is this type of set-up, especially if a swap partition is added? Thinking if there would be a lot of read and writes would a flash drive be up to the job due to wear or would a separate spinning HDD or a small partition from the USB3 NAS HDD be OK?</p><p>4) If the flash drive failed would the router fail completely or just the apps that are loaded in to the overlay?</p><p>5) I have already installed some apps via opkg so what happens to these, would these be moved when the overlay is changed / the second one is set-up or do I need to re-install them or worst case drop the router to factory and reinstall from scratch?</p><p>Thanks in advance for any info / insight you can give...</p><p>Paped</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>paped</strong> on 15 Aug 2016, 16:16)</p>
