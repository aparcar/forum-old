					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have DIR 615 E4 router, and I have installed the following on it : Backfire 10.3.1 RC5</p><p>I have written a program which continuously polls another server for any packets. If any packets are received, then, it replies with some packets/takes some action.</p><p>I am using the TCP (Blocking sockets) for this.</p><p>I deployed the program on the router and executed it.</p><p>It works correctly for sometime. Then, it unexpectedly hangs up. By that I mean that it just does nothing. It stays there as it is. I have to force end the program, then restart the program, and then it again runs for sometime before hanging up.</p><p>I took the program off from the router and ran it from my linux machine (PC). It works correctly.</p><p>I am not understanding why this error is occuring.</p><p>Any help will be greatly appreciated.</p><p>My socket functions : </p><p>SOCKET CREATE - socket(AF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,0)</p><p>SEND command - write(sockfd, what_to_write, how_much);</p><p>RECEIVE COMMAND - read(sockfd, what, how_much);</p><p>I am implementing this in a while loop.</p><p>My packet size is of 20 Bytes.</p><p>Plz. help me.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Darshan</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>darshan</strong> on 9 Jun 2012, 13:16)</p>
