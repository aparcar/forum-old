					<p>Hi.</p><br /><p>I actually managed to make OpenWRT on my both WGT634U.</p><p>Everything was absolutely fine. Well, there was only an issue for the installation. But so what.</p><br /><p>What I did:</p><p>I wanted to test OpenWRT as a wireless CLIENT. Just to help a friend who has very bad signal.<br />It did not work. Hours of setting up and trying, no way.</p><br /><p>What was the result:</p><p>As I tried both WGT634U as CLIENT mode wifi systems,&nbsp; now both are messed up.</p><p>* First of all, there were lots of Links in the Wifi settings. No way to delete them.<br />* Then I could not reliably login via the WAN ether port, which worked before great.<br />* No Wifi connections possible, which worked perfectly before.</p><p>What I tried to fix:</p><p>* I removed all unnecessary devices in&nbsp; /etc/config/wireless</p><br /><p>But still the whole box is now messed up. </p><br /><p>What I need:</p><p>A way to reset all settings of OpenWRT to start from scratch again. There is no point in trying to fix this individually, but resetting the whole system should do the job.</p><br /><p>How to do that?</p><p>Thanks!!!</p>									</div>
