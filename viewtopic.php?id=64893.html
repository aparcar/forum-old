					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;ve got a router set up as an OpenVPN gateway. After it&#039;s been running like this for a while, I can no longer use Luci, as it redirects to the login page every time I click something.</p><p>After I log in, the status overview is displayed. Sometimes some of the fields won&#039;t even populate (&quot;gathering data...&quot; may be displayed in &quot;IPv4 WAN status,&quot; for example). Other times the data will populate. But it seems to make no difference, I&#039;m still logged out every time.</p><p>Checking things out by ssh-ing in, no filesystems are full, CPU usage is fairly low, and I have about 6MB free of about 28MB of RAM. So it doesn&#039;t seem that resource starvation is a problem.</p><p>Any ideas? Known issue? This is a router with 4MB flash / 32MB RAM.</p>									</div>
