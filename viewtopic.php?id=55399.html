					<p>Hello!</p><p>i would need to have timeout in the wget command. Busybox doesnt suport it, and on the MR3040 there isnt enough storage to install the full wget package. I also tried with a custom package but there simply isnt enough storage left..</p><p>Is there a way to abort the wget if it doestn get an answer from the host within 10 seconds?</p><p>can i compile (with image builder) a version that includes the -T option in busybox? or is there an alternative to wget?</p><p>thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s easy enough to do, provided you have a build environment setup to compile your own firmware.</p><p>Get that going, then from Menuconfig go:<br />Base System -&gt; Busybox -&gt; Networking Utilities -&gt; wget&nbsp; &nbsp;Enable read timeout option -T SEC</p><p>build your firmware, flash and you should be good.</p>									</div>

					<p>You could also consider downloading the image builder and simply include the full wget package inside the SquashFS partition, without having to compile a single thing.
