I don&#039;t know enough about the address space layout, though, so I can&#039;t tell what&#039;s mapped to address 0x80256f48.

					<p>I just realiized: what is EIP doing inside nvram_buf? There shouldn&#039;t be any executable code here, right? Or does EIP simply point to the faulty address in this case?</p><p>Which leads me to another question: I would like to contribute a bit more to kernel development, however, reading source code (PMON is mostly uncommented) can get you only so far.
