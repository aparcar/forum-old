					<p>Hello all,</p><p>THE WORK:</p><p>i hope this is not that much off topic, but i wanted to post my first attempt to upgrade the usr5461 wlan router from 8 to 32 mb ram.<br />I removed the 8 mb &quot;em638325ts-6g&quot; from EtronTech and replaced it with two 16 mb &quot;hyb39s128160ct-7.5&quot; from infineon.<br />There where two places for holding the two memory chips. (Board: RT-G-BR-02 REV 3.1)</p><p>I doubled checked everything twice before i connected the seriell-cable.</p><p>THE PROBLEM:</p><p>After i connected the seriell-cable and powering on i didn&#039;t see nothing.<br />All the lights came on and shortly after turned off again, instead the power light.<br />This behavior should be normal.<br />But it seems that either i screwed my router as a whole or i&nbsp; just screwed the flash?</p><p>THE QUESTIONS:</p><p>Now the questions, before i can do further investigations, are:</p><p>1. Does the broadcom (bcm5350) chip load the cfe-firmware into the memory (and then starts from there) or does it start directly from the flash?<br />2. Does somebody know if its normal that theres nothing to see on the seriell-console, if the memory is not installed correctly?<br />3. Is there a way to check the flash-memory? Where is the JTAG-interface at the USR5461? (There seems to be some connection-parts on the backside at r125, r28, r30 and 31?)<br />4. Is there something else that comes to mind and i should consider?</p><p>If somebody wants to see some pictures of my work, i&#039;ll can put them on my homepage or some place else.</p><p>I&#039;m thinking of replacing the infineon-chips by other ones, since the default memory-chip from EtronTech where capable of running at 166 MHz and the infineons do only run at maximal 133 MHz.<br />(This could be a failure too, since i don&#039;t know the default memory-clock settings. (e.g. 100 MHz or 166 MHz?))</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>

					<p>As far as I know the USR5461 is similar to Belkin F5D7230-4 (1444) and SE505V2.

					<p>Hello,</p><p>first of all, sorry for the late reply.<br />I did some further investigations and put up some pictures here:</p><p><a href="http://www.fogman.de/usr5461/img01.jpg">http://www.fogman.de/usr5461/img01.jpg</a><br /><a href="http://www.fogman.de/usr5461/img02.jpg">http://www.fogman.de/usr5461/img02.jpg</a><br /><a href="http://www.fogman.de/usr5461/img03.jpg">http://www.fogman.de/usr5461/img03.jpg</a><br /><a href="http://www.fogman.de/usr5461/img04.jpg">http://www.fogman.de/usr5461/img04.jpg</a></p><p>My (un)wiring of the original memory was a little crappy.<br />I checked all connections twice!<br />All Address,Data, and so on buses are still connected and (hopefully) functional.<br />If you remove P902, you have to put a resistor in R33 so that clk is still connected for both memory-chips.</p><p>It seems that i broke one/two of my memorys.<br />So i will do some more testings with a network-analyzer at the university.</p><p>Maybe i&#039;m missing something else?</p>									</div>

Can you please elaborate this? I sure would like to make my USR5461 to have more RAM without any hardware mods.</p>									</div>
