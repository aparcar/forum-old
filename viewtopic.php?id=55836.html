					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve just bought the TP-Link TL-WDR3600, and I would like to install OpenWRT on it.</p><p>BUT... I do not want to brick it on the first days. Please excuse me if my questions are noob questions, but I would like to avoid any bad manipulations.</p><p>So, first, I need to download a pre-built image. From the Wiki, I understand that I have to take an image for the architecture &#039;ar71xx&#039;.<br />Is this one the good one? 14.07 -&gt; AR71xx -&gt; squashfs-factory (<a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wdr3600-v1-squashfs-factory.bin">https://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_b â€¦ actory.bin</a>)</p><p>For now, the router is running the original firmware. Here are the version informations in the configuration page : <br />Firmware Version:&nbsp; &nbsp; 3.13.34 Build 130909 Rel.53148n<br />Hardware Version:&nbsp; &nbsp; WDR3600 v1 00000000</p><p>It says hardware version 1, BUT on the label on the bottom of the device, it is written version 1.5.</p><p>Do you know of any issue I could encounter with this version?</p><p>Once it&#039;ll we installed, will everything work out of the box (local net, internet, wifi,...) or should I expect to do some manual manipulations ?</p><p>Thank you for your help!</p>									</div>

					<p>Yep you got the right file. Version 1.x use the same firmware files. It may be worth updating to the latest stock firmware before upgrading to OpenWrt. Some TP-Link routers gained a recovery mode in the boot loader (which is left alone by OpenWrt) - this may come in handy if you have a failed flash now or later. Upgrading the boot loader later will require going back to stock or doing something fancy/complicated.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve successfuly upgraded the stock firmware and installed OpenWRT on my WDR3600! <br />For now, it&#039;s working like a charm!<br />I installed miniupnpd for UPNP and luci-app-statistics statistics, and everything is good for now!</p><p>I&#039;m impressed by the webUI! There are so much options and possibilities!!! My previous router was the one from my ISP, I couldn&#039;t configure anything. What a change!</p><p>Thanks for your help, I&#039;ll continue my exploration!</p>									</div>
