					<p>first of all you need HFS+ with case sensitive file system. so.. a reformat mabye. second you need latest XCode installed. <br />i&#039;ve successfully build openwrt this way though.. the same speed when using a virtual linux machine in vmware with the big advantage that you can take the VM with you @ work ...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dlbogdan</strong> on 17 Apr 2008, 00:49)</p>

					<p>You can use a disk image formatted with case-sensitive HFS+ to avoid reformatting your drive. In addition to Xcode, you need to install gawk, sed, and xargs. The version of sed that ships with OS X won&#039;t work. If you&#039;re running Tiger or running Leopard on an Intel-based Mac, that should be enough to be able to build Kamikaze successfully. If you&#039;re running Leopard on a PPC-based system, you have to patch gcc to get it to compile successfully.</p>									</div>
