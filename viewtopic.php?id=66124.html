					<p>Hi,<br />I&#039;m trying to de-brick TP-LINK WR841ND 8.1 . On cable Nokia DKU-5 I&#039;m able to type/send data, but there are too many errors during transfer, whenever I switch data to anything else then 115200 speed, I get garbage only. <br />When I use cable CP2102 USB 2.0 to TTL UART cable (<a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/item/CP2102-USB-2-0-to-TTL-UART-Module-6Pin-Serial-Converter-STC-Replace-FT232-Module/1859102520.html?spm=2114.13010608.0.55.nsarG4">http://www.aliexpress.com/item/CP2102-U â€¦ .55.nsarG4</a>) , on speed 128000 I&#039;m getting 100% clear output but the console is read only.<br />I have tried 10 kOhm resistor between VCC and RX - no change. I was searching for R26 resistor, didn&#039;t found it. (should be anyway applicable for 8.1). I was changing PINs RX/TX if they are not switched - no change.</p><p>Any idea please what is wrong please ?</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, so fixed....I start to ignore reading errors and simply followed debrick guide. Seems that only reading/displaying on the console is wrong, as everything went well (had to use Nikia DKU-5).</p><p>Look on the console output :<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Autobnothng in 1 rebonds
