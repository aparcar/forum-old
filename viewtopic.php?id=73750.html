					<p>Hello, am new to this forum,<br />So I wonder if someone here knows how to enter to serial console on a openwrt powered router. <br />It had luci as web interface and an openwrt os but after flashing it from web interface now it is bricked. <br />- it is labeled powerplus. <br />- it has a Qualcomm ship, I could know from its update repo it was a generic ar7xxx.<br />- I flashed it with an alpha flash. <br />- now it is not accessible it doesn&#039;t have an ip adresse but it acts like dhcp client and I could give it and adresse and I see that it contacts ntp server from openwrt on tcpdump</p>									</div>
