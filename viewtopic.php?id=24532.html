					<p>My needs were&nbsp; similar to those of scerpio. The difference is, that I wanted to integrate new functionality with Luci and make things as simple as possible.<br />Thus, I wrote my own package for similar purpose, see:</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=60801">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=60801</a></p><p>You can block internet access from specific hosts in arbitrary times of day.

					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>when I try to install this under 15.05 CC, it says it&#039;s unable to find the control file and nothing I have found online is helping. I would love to have this to protect my daughter from... ahem... unsavoury minecraft users and promote her going to bed at a proper time (which is why I want to implement this as a deterrent).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>repherb</strong> on 22 Aug 2016, 22:22)</p>
