					<p>Hi there. I have OpenWRT installed on a TP-LINK with USB.</p><p>I have a USB Hub (with a power source), extroot installed on a 32GB usb stick and an external hard drive for storage.</p><p>What I want to do is to insert in the USB Hub <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Edimax-EW-7811UN-Wireless-802-11b-150Mbps/dp/B003MTTJOY/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1335961626&amp;sr=8-13">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Edimax-EW-7811U â€¦ mp;sr=8-13</a> and connect it to a Joikuspot Network made from a cellphone that I use as landline.</p><p>I want to use OpenWRT Multi-WAN to balance this connection with a cable one and also if one of them crashes I will automatically have the other one.</p><p>Is this possible?</p><p>PS: I know that my phone battery will eventually die, but I use it as a landline phone and it&#039;s always plugged in.<br />PS2: I know that if my LAN goes off I can just connect to my Joikuspot network, but... I just want that to be automatically &amp; I want load balancing <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />PS3: Although my router has WiFi (TP-Link TL-WR1043N/ND v1), I connect all my devices over WiFi, so I guess I couldn&#039;t connect to a WiFi network and listen another one at the same time, can I?</p><p>Can anybody help me? Will that adaptor be compatible with OpenWRT? Can I use Multi-Wan with WLAN?<br />Thanks a lot in advance.</p>									</div>
