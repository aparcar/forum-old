					<p>I got a yet untouched WR841 and this is my dream-configuration:</p><p>In my students hostel everyone gots one ethernet jack but we&#039;re not allowed to plug in routers or switches, because they say it would mess up the whole network.</p><p>I&#039;d guess it&#039;s because most routers got a standard activated DHCP-Server which would distribute to everyone in the network new IP adresses and ruin the whole thing.</p><p>I just tried using a switch and I can access to the Internet simultaneously with two devices. But I&#039;d like to use the router for WLAN. (would it be even possible to connect the router to the switch? as long as the devices are not visible)</p><p>So I&#039;d like to configure my WR841 like a switch and prevent messing the network up or even be visible (I don&#039;t want them to see that I use my chromebook, computer and phone (at the same time) via WLAN)<br />Cause that would allow them to ban me for using multiple devices if they notice.</p><p>I&#039;m very sorry if my question is too stupid or not understandable, I read a couple Wikipedia articles about networking but I still don&#039;t get the whole idea behind it. And I&#039;m just looking for the right keywords so I can get my problem solved by myself.</p><p>I don&#039;t expect a step-by-step tutorial, so just give me a hint in the right direction. I assume that bridging the network would be one solution.</p><p>Thank you very much,<br />I hope in future I can support you guys <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Just connect the network with the WAN Port, that even works with the TP-Link Software in its default setup. Change the Mac-Adress so that the administrator can not directly see that you have connected a TP-Link device. Just never connect the network with any LAN Port, that indeed would bring you DHCP problems.</p>									</div>

					<p>Just deactivated DHCP in the setup and now I&#039;m using the router as a switch (if I got that right, or is it called a hub?) So everything (even the network) is connected in LAN ports.<br />Just started to getting problems today with the WLAN:<br />It doesn&#039;t seem to be stable as long as the network is connected. But without any connections I can perfectly access the setup of the router.<br />The network seems to change the subnet and distributes ip adresses (i can use multiple LAN devices at once) but it doesn&#039;t like my phones/chromebook anymore <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>Thanks anyway <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
