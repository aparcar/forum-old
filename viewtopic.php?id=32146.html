					<p>Calculating... calculating ... it shows 73% of the eventual value. How do you define &quot;reasonable approximation&quot;? You mean practicable.</p><p>The allegation that it is impossible to be predicted, is found here:&nbsp; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/filesystems">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/filesystems</a> so I know about it.<br />But I just didn&#039;t realize how big the discrepancy is and also I suspected, that we work with values always bigger then the eventual true value.</p><p>Without reading too much about the compression of JFFS2/SquashFS, is this like: you have FILE1.txt with 100Bytes and pack it with gzip, and it will have new size 10Bytes. But when you pack FILE1 together with FILE2.txt (unknown size) you cannot predict how big the gzped file will be, nor how much the part of the gziped file will be, that belongs to data of file1. It probably will be smaller due to, let&#039;s call it &quot;synergy&quot;. But it cannot be bigger, can it?</p><p>Shortly: &quot;impossible to predict&quot; is of course exactly TRUE, but is it possible to [s]predict[/s] guess it more precisely? You should be able to predict the exact maximum value, if you assume this package is the first and only package being written to JFFS2. (The compression of the JFFS2 does not consider data on the SquashFS!?) If you then write more data to the partition, the already contained data, the files should not take up MORE space, but probably slightly less.</p><p>That is how I imagined it, and understood the above statment, as if opkg is too simple to guess the size, and not that it is mathematically impossible to give a max size. (You should be able to ask the JFFS2 driver to simulate, before actually doing the writing, at least in theory, but that is not what I am after.)</p><p>When people write: maxed out JFFS2, I assumed they were to lazy to actually look up how much space they have left and that there is a lack of an automatism to warn, but not that you cannot give an maximum file size!</p>									</div>

					<p>thx, penkert.</p><p>You could check for free space with df, but how can you determine the actual size of any file contained on a JFFS2 partition?<br />Why would I want to do that? Out of curiosity and also to see the discrepancy. (Yes, it&#039;s got to be small.)</p>									</div>
