					<p>Hello there, I have setup and installed OpenWRT on a Asus 500G Premium with Webif2, FreeRadius, Lighttpd, Chillispot, php4, ssl on a 2 GB USB thumb drive. Great software I really love the work everyone has put into this distro. </p><p>I was wanting to know if anyone knows how to setup freeradius to use the OpenWRT /etc/passwd and /etc/group files for authentication or SAMBA passwd instead of using a database like MYSQL.</p><p>I have chillispot working fine, broadcasts DHCP IP&#039;s to all wireless connections and redirects connections to the lighttpd server on port 81 + ssl. Now I want to authenticate chillispot with freeradius but like I said above with the system accounts.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure if I need to use PAM for system passwords.</p><p>Thanks<br />D</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>digitalexpl0it</strong> on 19 Mar 2007, 08:54)</p>
