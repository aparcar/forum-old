					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve been playing around with Wireless N and no matter how many changes I make, I cannot seem to get more than 150 Mbps on 10.03.1. I&#039;ve done all the driver upgrades, etc but nothing seems to work.</p><p>So the question is, does anyone out there have a Wireless N laptop connecting to 10.03.1 at speeds greater than 150 Mbps? If so, can you please post your router, the wireless card in your laptop and your wireless driver version?</p><p>Paul</p>									</div>

					<p>Great, all my laptops have Atheros chipsets with the latest drivers. I wonder if it has more to do with the chipset in the laptop than with OpenWRT. Alternatively, there may be some setting in the driver or registry that needs to be set that I don&#039;t know about.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ahhh! Just found the problem. All of my laptops have Atheros chipsets that only support 1 stream, single band, so that means 150 Mbps. Specifically, the chip ends with 1ND whereas it needs to end with 2ND to allow 300 Mbps. Problem solved. So when looking for a laptop you need to check if it&#039;s wireless n 150 or wireless n 300 in your laptop!!! </p><p>Probably everyone else knew this, but I didn&#039;t.</p><p>Check out<br /><a href="http://www.atheros.com/computing/technology.php?nav1=26">http://www.atheros.com/computing/technology.php?nav1=26</a></p><p>You need a AR9002WB-2NG which is referenced <a href="http://www.atheros.com/computing/technology.php?nav1=28&amp;product=76">http://www.atheros.com/computing/techno â€¦ product=76</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pmerrill</strong> on 21 Apr 2012, 04:10)</p>
