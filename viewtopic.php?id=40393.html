So you have a repository where the packages stay the same until you upgrade them. But I did not see that in the post you referenced, maybe you have to wait...</p><br /><p>The other option will only work if you are lucky and the kernel version in your build is exactly v3.3.8, matching current builds. Only do that if you can take the risk of bricking it at least for some time, otherwise dont do that...(!) I dont own this model, I dont know if it can be easily un-bricked, most likely not if it is in experimental stage...</p><p>The openwrt Kernel version changes on each build due to the way it is generated - if just one single option in the config is changed, dependencies are broken for opkg. Example: if one switches off a single media-related module in the kernel config, the version number will be totally different while not affecting anything network related. If your currently kernel matches v3.3.8, you can try to force-install the package (opkg --force-depends...), if it is not v3.3.8, dont try it at all.</p>									</div>
