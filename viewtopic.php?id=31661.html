					<p>I read on another forum:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>the v1 hardware is the better unit anyway, the v2 only has 2 5g antenna the v1 has 3. along with a few other minor changes......&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;honestly the v2 has worse 5g range and maybe SLIGHTLY better 2.4 is much change at all. with version 1.0.0.8 firmware for the v2 both units pretty much are a toss up minus the 5g.</p></blockquote></div><p>It&#039;s true this ?

					<p>Generally V2 is seen as a better one.<br />V1 has 8 MB flash RAM, while V2 has 16 MB giving v2 a bit more expandability in Openwrt sense.<br />No other difference, except a minor change in 5 GHz antenna placement.</p><p>You might read also this:<br /><a href="http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/wireless/wireless-reviews/31396-netgear-wndr3700v2-n600-wireless-dual-band-gigabit-router-reviewed">http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/wireless … r-reviewed</a><br /><a href="http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/wireless/wireless-reviews/31430-netgear-wndr3700v2-5-ghz-band-retest">http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/wireless … and-retest</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Erm... I think general opinion is the V1 is better than the V2, especially when it comes to the wireless signal. The only thing the V2 has going for it is it has twice the amount of flash over V1.</p><p>The second link you are quoting even has this in the conclusion:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>SmallNetBuilder wrote:</cite><blockquote><p><strong>At any rate, the retested v2, although better, still doesn&#039;t beat the original&#039;s performance</strong>.

					<p>Yeah, it is a question about how you weigh the 5GHz wireless signal (possibly better in v1) against a larger flash memory (double in v2).</p>									</div>

					<p>You can work around the flash &#039;limitation&#039; (which it really isn&#039;t, it&#039;s just a luxury to have 16 MB of flash instead of 8, 8 is plenty for OpenWrt) by using a USB stick or disk; you can&#039;t work around the hardware implementation that easily.</p>									</div>
