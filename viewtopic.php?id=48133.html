					<p>Hello,</p><br /><p>I would like my OpenWRT router to act as a wireless bridge for my existing wifi network so I can plug wired ethernet machines into the OpenWRT router and they get internet access from my existing ADSL router via WiFi.</p><p>I&#039;m pretty new to OpenWRT, but I&#039;ve been following this guide to setup a wireless bridge:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds</a></p><p>I haven&#039;t been able to make this work and would greatly appreciate any help! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><br /><h5>The Setup</h5><p>The above guide assumes OpenWRT running on both the &quot;Access Point&quot; and the &quot;Station&quot;, but I am trying to setup a client for my existing network where the &quot;Access Point&quot; is <em>not</em> running OpenWRT. Here is the hardware:</p><p><strong>Access Point:</strong> Netcomm NB604N (running the stock firmware)<br /><strong>Wireless Station</strong> Western Digital N600 (running OpenWRT)</p><p>The NB604N does support &quot;WDS&quot; and it is enabled.<br />The `wifi detect` indicates that the N600 is &#039;mac80211&#039;</p><br /><h5>The problem</h5><p>I have followed the guide and it seems like the N600 (OpenWRT) is associated and authorized on the NB604N.</p><p>The instructions say:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>The device should boot and automatically connect wirelessly to the access point. Wait until the client bridge device associates with the access point. This can take 1-2 minutes for the association to happen. Once this has happened, the wired interface (e.g. eth0) should succeed in getting a DHCP address through the new wireless bridge connection. Note that the wireless interface itself on the remote client bridge device does not get an IP address as it is now acting as a transparent bridge.</p></blockquote></div><p>I connected a laptop to one of the ethernet ports but it is not getting an IP address assigned to it.<br />I then tried setting a static IP on the laptop and pinging the NB604N (192.168.1.1), but that failed.</p><p>Now I don&#039;t know how to connect to the N600 (OpenWRT) other than going into failsafe mode and starting again.<br />This means I can&#039;t paste my configs, but the configs I set are straight from the guide.</p><p>Any ideas on why this isn&#039;t working?<br />I&#039;m open to suggestions on what to try next.<br />I&#039;m happy to start all over again and paste all my config (before I reboot and can&#039;t connect to it again)</p><br /><p>Any help would be great!<br />Thanks in advance</p>									</div>

					<p>The wds between different devices sometimes does not work. I was unable to make wds bridge between wr741n and some comtrend vdsl modem too, even if it does have wds enabled and I have several wds bridges between tp-links wr 741 and 841 working. So I solved that bridging with vdsl using relayd.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 1 Jan 2014, 18:45)</p>

					<p>If you have followed the Atheros WDS guide, the Openwrt slave router should now have an IP different than 192.168.1.1. (e.g. 192.168.1.2. or .3). If you now set a fixed IP to your PC&#039;s LAN connection and connect via an LAN cable to Openwrt router, you should be able to access its console and edit the config files quite normally. </p><p>I edited the wiki article a bit, as there was dangerous advice, which may have affected you. It suggested that you let the STA router to get its own IP via DCHP from the AP. If the WDS link does not work, then the router does not get IP and you can&#039;t access its config. Sounds like the issue into which you ran. It is much better to set manually the STA router&#039;s IP to e.g. 192.168.1.2. Then you can access its config normally if you set your PC to have static 192.168.1.3 or something...</p><br /><p>EDIT:<br />Alternative advice:<br />Forget about WDS. Do you really need it if you only want to connect wired PCs to get connectivity to the main router?<br />Configure the second router to be an STA, so that it connects to AP via wifi. Give it a static IP of 192.168.1.2.&nbsp; And then set gateway settings to point to the main router at 192.168.1.1. Possibly also disable firewall.&nbsp; (Not really sure about have DHCP active in the second router, but you might configure its DHCP pool to have a different space than the main router. The main router has .100-.250 by default, so set this STA to have DHCP giving out .50-.80 )</p><p>You might also read the advice in this thread: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39077">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39077</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 1 Jan 2014, 19:23)</p>

					<p>Thank you for your replies!</p><p><strong>@forquare:</strong> It looks like the problem you are trying to solve is quite different to mine. May I kindly suggest you start your own thread.</p><p><strong>@hnyman:</strong> Thanks, your update to the wiki makes a lot of sense.<br />I ran through the instructions again, but this time set a static IP address (192.168.1.2). I still have SSH access, but I can&#039;t reach the AP router (192.168.1.1) from the laptop or the STA router.</p><p><strong>@nozombian</strong>, thanks, I think you&#039;re right. I did read that different manufacturers implement WDS differently - too bad.</p><p><strong>@hnyman &amp; @nozombian:</strong> So it looks like WDS will not work for me, but I do have one more requirement.<br />Ideally, if I had one machine connected to the AP router and another machine connected to the STA router, I would like to be able to SSH from any one of these machines to the other one. I&#039;m no networking expert, but AFAIK that means they all need to be in the same subnet (I can&#039;t use a NAT) and I don&#039;t really understand relayd very well.<br />Is this still possible without WDS?</p><p><strong>@hnyman:</strong> I&#039;d like to try what you said (without WDS), but I&#039;m a little confused with the bridge interface as it covers the lan and wlan, I&#039;m not sure how to give it an address by itself.<br />If its ok with you, here are my configs, I&#039;d be very grateful for some help.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># /etc/config/network
