					<p>Hello,<br />I am trying to trouble shoot my connection problem with setting up pppoe.&nbsp; I have never used pppoe on kamikaze before (only DHCP when I had a cable provider).&nbsp; I have setup my AT&amp;T dsl modem into bridge mode.&nbsp; I would like my router to initiate the pppoe connection.&nbsp; I have been reading through the forums to try and find documentation and I think I am close but obviously something isn&#039;t rigtht and so here is my request for a gently nudge in the right direction.&nbsp; Below is the diganostic information I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll need.&nbsp; Please let me know if you need more.&nbsp; In some cases I have truncated the output for the sake of brevity.&nbsp; As of now I don&#039;t seem to be able to even start up a connection.&nbsp; I get a message about scan_ppp not found.&nbsp; (see my output below).&nbsp; </p><p>My questions are-<br />#1 Does it make a difference if I name the interface ppp0 or eth0.1? (I had tried the config file both ways but could not get pppd to start in either case.)<br />#2 I am looking in the right area to try and fix the scan_ppp not found issue?&nbsp; I am not really sure what that output means...</p><p>root@fw:/etc/config# cat /etc/banner<br />KAMIKAZE (8.09, r14549) </p><p>config &#039;switch&#039; &#039;eth0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;vlan1&#039; &#039;0 5*&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;vlan0&#039; &#039;1 2 3 5*&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;vlan2&#039; &#039;4 5*&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;vlan3&#039; &#039;5*&#039;</p><p>config &#039;interface&#039; &#039;loopback&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ifname&#039; &#039;lo&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ipaddr&#039; &#039;127.0.0.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;netmask&#039; &#039;255.0.0.0&#039;</p><p>config &#039;interface&#039; &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ifname&#039; &#039;eth0.0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ipaddr&#039; &#039;192.168.1.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;netmask&#039; &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;macaddr&#039; &#039;&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ip6addr&#039; &#039;&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ip6gw&#039; &#039;&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;dns&#039; &#039;&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;gateway&#039; &#039;&#039;</p><p>config &#039;interface&#039; &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ifname&#039; &#039;ppp0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;pppoe&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;macaddr&#039; &#039;&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ip6addr&#039; &#039;&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ip6gw&#039; &#039;&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ipaddr&#039; &#039;&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;netmask&#039; &#039;&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;gateway&#039; &#039;&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;dns&#039; &#039;&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;username&#039; &#039;XXX@att.net&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;password&#039; &#039;XXXXXX&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;vpi&#039; &#039;&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;vci&#039; &#039;&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;mtu&#039; &#039;1492&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;keepalive&#039; &#039;&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;defaultroute&#039; &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ppp_redial&#039; &#039;persist&#039;</p><p>root@fw:/lib/network# ifup wan<br />/sbin/ifup: eval: line 1: scan_ppp: not found<br />/sbin/ifup: eval: line 1: scan_ppp: not found<br />/sbin/ifup: eval: line 1: start_pppd: not found</p><br /><p>root@fw:/etc/config# lsmod<br />Module&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Size&nbsp; Used by&nbsp; &nbsp; Tainted: P<br />pppoe&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;9320&nbsp; &nbsp;0 (unused)<br />pppox&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1196&nbsp; &nbsp;1 [pppoe]<br />ppp_generic&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 22380&nbsp; &nbsp;0 [pppoe pppox]</p><br /><p>root@fw:/etc/config#opkg list<br />ppp - 2.4.3-10 -<br />ppp-mod-pppoe - 2.4.3-10 -<br />qos-scripts - 1.2.1-2 -<br />rp-pppoe-client - 3.10-1 -</p><p>I had also tried using the rp-pppoe-client package but no joy there either.&nbsp; (I won&#039;t confuse the issue any further by listing my problems there.)&nbsp; I&#039;ll just stick with&nbsp; the first two packages (ppp and ppp-mod-pppoe).&nbsp; I assume I could just uninstall rp-pppoe-client because it is redundant and would accomplish my same goal.&nbsp; Many thanks in advance for your help!</p><p>Silly me, I forgot to mention I am running this on an Asus WL-520GU router.&nbsp; I am using the 2.4 kernel.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jtpiano</strong> on 22 Aug 2011, 00:13)</p>
