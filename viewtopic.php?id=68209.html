					<p>I&#039;m currently developing an IoT device based on the well known ESP8266 module (ESP12F).<br />The device uses OpenWrt as connection router as well as MQTT broker and database host.<br />It&#039;s all working just fine, except for the Wi-Fi connection time that is not constant, ranging from about 900 miliseconds to more that 3 seconds.<br />Since the devices are running on batteries and go to sleep once data has been sent to database, the more they stay &quot;awake&quot; the more the battery is drawn, therefore the router connection time is crucial to the battery life.<br />I have made many tests on both sides IoT module and OpenWrt but with no luck.<br />Someone suggests to force a fixed IP address on the IoT module in order to avoid DHCP query, but in my tests that did not provide a real benefit.<br />Any suggestion is welcome.</p>									</div>
