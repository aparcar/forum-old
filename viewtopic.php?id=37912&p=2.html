					<p>@metamorph:<br />Not sure why you want to build the factory image.&nbsp; What I did was to first load the 703n Openwrt image.&nbsp; It should work except for the second ethernet port.&nbsp; (You need to modify the the header, though.)&nbsp; Then you can modify the source code to recompile and enable both ethernet ports.&nbsp; It should be pretty straight forward.</p>									</div>
