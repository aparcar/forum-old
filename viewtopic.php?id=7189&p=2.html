					<p>Joyful - the Meraki Mini is now booting! The serial port speed was all it was. I was surprised not to see any garbage characters when the kernel was writing at 9600 and the terminal was set to 115200.</p><p>I see a few odd warnings:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Jan  1 00:00:16 (none) user.info : ifconfig: inet6: Unknown host
Jan  1 00:00:17 (none) user.info : ifconfig: inet6: Unknown host
...
Jan  1 00:00:23 (none) user.info kernel: wifi0: Atheros 2315 WiSoC: mem=0xb0000000, irq=3
Jan  1 00:00:24 (none) user.info : Interface doesn&#039;t accept private ioctl...
Jan  1 00:00:24 (none) user.info : mode (8BE2): Invalid argument</code></pre></div><p>but basically it appears to be working. Yay! I&#039;ve updated the documentation with what I&#039;ve learned.</p><p>One problem is that out-of-the-box, the Meraki doesn&#039;t have FIS partition entries for its two main 3.25MB partitions. Rather, the locations of these two partitions are hardcoded into their stage2 bootloader and their kernel.</p><p>However, you can create these using RedBoot&gt;, even without a serial cable if you telnet in at exactly the right time. I&#039;ve documented this too. It might be simpler if there were a FIS partitioning tool that you could run from within Linux; this would give a way to upgrade a Meraki just by scp&#039;ing a script over to it and running it.</p><p>With 8MB of flash, I do like the Meraki idea of having two firmware images concurrently loaded, to make it harder to brick when remotely upgrading. However at the moment this means further sub-partitioning of the unit (kernel 1, rootfs 1, kernel 2, rootfs 2). It would be nice if we could have a single firmware image containing kernel+squashfs root, and use the remainder of the partition for jffs2, as White Russian does on Broadcom devices.</p><p>Not sure how to implement that though. Perhaps modify the Meraki stage2 loader to read TRX files??</p><p>Finally - I do think it&#039;s worthwhile being able to create LZMA images which the stage2 loader can run, so perhaps this is worth integrating this capability into OpenWrt (it just has to prepend a length and modified CRC32)</p><p>Regards, Brian.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well I guess everything else I find now is just a Kamikaze-ism.</p><p>If I telnet into the unit then I start a process like &quot;ping x.x.x.x&quot;, ctrl-C or ctrl-Z doesn&#039;t stop it. Even breaking the telnet session (^] close) and then telnetting in again, I find the process is still running.</p><p>I guess this is a symptom of this error, which I see when logging in:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/bin/ash: can&#039;t access tty; job control turned off</code></pre></div><p>Also it looks like wpa_supplicant support is missing for &#039;sta&#039; and &#039;wds&#039; modes (based on comment in /lib/wifi/madwifi.sh). Also, is the &#039;wet&#039; mode missing entirely?

					<p>OK I have to admit that I have not gone through all the source code.&nbsp; The fact is at the moment I do not have the time.&nbsp; I am buried at the moment and need help.</p><p>I am working on a White Paper for the Lt Governor of Illinois.&nbsp; The focus of this is how communities can succeed in WIFI where the telcos have failed.&nbsp; I have built hypothetical case studies for pilot programs using several different sizes of communities and hybrid non-profit/for profit business models.&nbsp; In two of these possible case studies I have used the Meraki technology as a possibility.</p><p>However, there are three issues that bother me about Meraki.</p><p>1) I do not care that they are backed by Google, 98% of tech start-ups fail.&nbsp; So there are a list of &quot;What ifs&quot; that bother me.&nbsp; Meraki is as much a business service model as it is a hardware/software product.&nbsp; Based upon conversations with both people in sales and engineering roles, the hardware design is dependent on the back office management of their proprietary radius server and Dashboard software.&nbsp; And, so its hard to judge the total merits of the hardware, if ALL the bits (of source) are not included.&nbsp; So, I would appreciate comments on usability in the event of implosion of the company.</p><p>2)&nbsp; I am a little suspect of the use of a single radio in each node.&nbsp; My experience in building WIFI has been using technology that allows for dual radios in each node.&nbsp; One set of radios is then used to build a mesh and a second set of radios to create hot spots and user access.&nbsp; Has anyone had experience actually deploying Meraki.</p><p>3) and this is the issue that REALLY bugs me.&nbsp; OK so I am really biased and suspect all vendors who use Linux and FOSS for the creation of commercial products.&nbsp; I am not totally happy with some of the answers I have gotten from people at Meraki about their compliance with the GPL.&nbsp; I know these guys have a great reputation, part of the roof top project and all, so I want to believe them.&nbsp; But believing people has gotten the Open Source community into a whole lot of grief over the years.&nbsp; I have been getting the answer &quot;we can not show you full source as some components use proprietary technology.&quot;</p><p>Its real simple, just because you sign an agreement with a company to use their proprietary stuff are you all of a sudden immune from observing the GPL.</p><p>So, I have a few questions for those of you who have really peeled back the layers of the posted Meraki source code.&nbsp; The only way to tell is to look at the code and comments, which I do not have time to do.&nbsp; I want to give Meraki a fair shake. </p><p>1- Does it appear that have observed both the OpenWRT license and the Linux license by fully releasing ALL source code?&nbsp; Are there holes in their released code? </p><p>2- Please make a judgment if their developments were possible to develop without looking at the source code of Linux first?&nbsp; </p><p>You can post here, but I would appreciate you to also email me at jeff@gerhardt.org</p>									</div>
