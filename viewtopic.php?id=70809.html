					<p>I&#039;ve searched but can&#039;t find a clear answer - <br />Using Backfire on an older TP-Link router (no USB port) - everything works great and I have *some* space oboard to install packages via opkg. I have written a small script to do some device management using the UART, but I can not get it to stay in place across reboots. I&#039;ve tried saving it in different locations, which must be do-able (as the packages I install via opkg stay in place) but I am having 0 luck. I&#039;m likely missing something simple here that I&#039;m not seeing for some reason. <br />Any help is appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>The contents of all these folders should be kept across reboots, and seem suitable for a script:<br />/bin/<br />/sbin/<br />/root/<br />/usr/bin/<br />/usr/sbin/<br />/usr/libexec/</p>									</div>
