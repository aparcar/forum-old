					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have completely rewritten <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.openvpn">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.openvpn</a>, and plan to make some serious changes to <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.server.openvpn.tun">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.s â€¦ penvpn.tun</a> </p><p>The first article has two &#039;beginner&#039;s scenarios&#039;, and the second will include several useful &#039;recipes&#039; for OpenVPN implementations.</p><p>These two wikis would really benefit from the inclusion of simple diagrams to give a visual overview of the network architecture used in each example.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I am a very poor graphic designer (rubbish, in fact).</p><p>Would someone be willing to take on this role now and in the future (as more recipes are added to the wiki)?</p><p>The required elements would consist of the OpenWrt router (usually acting as an OpenVPN server), an OpenVPN client, other clients &amp; servers, subnets, the Internet, the OpenVPN tunnel, etc.</p><p>If anyone is Interested, then maybe you could read the first wiki, and respond with the requisite diagram?&nbsp; Or PM me?</p><p>It would be a requirement that everything was appropriately licensed...</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, fair enough, I will endeavour to add an example here tonight, but for scenario 1, roughly:</p><p>&nbsp; (client with OpenVPN) -- (subnet) -- (router) -- (Internet) -- (OpenWrt running OpenVPN) -- (subnet at home)</p><p>and, after the tunnel is started, this super-imposed on top:</p><p>&nbsp; (client running OpenVPN) -- (tunnel) -- (OpenWrt running OpenVPN)</p><p>Simples!</p>									</div>

					<p>FYI - I was able to setup OpenVPN with the help of your re-written wiki quite easily. Otherwise I was quite contented with PPTP and probably wouldn&#039;t have dared to try OpenVPN had this beginner wiki didn&#039;t exist. Thanks for the effort zxdavb. Now even nicer if someone could restore luci-openvpn for ultra newbies.</p>									</div>
