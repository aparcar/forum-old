					<p>sorry I just though you got a wrt54g v2 but I&#039;m not familiar with the wrt54g2 v1 I was checking the ddwrt homepage&nbsp; <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Supported_Devices#Cisco">http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Su … ices#Cisco</a> and it seems it has only 2MB flash and 16MB RAM. 2MB is not enough for openwrt, you will need 4MB at least</p>									</div>

					<p>vpnc is designed as client for temporarly connecting to a vpn-concentrator (on a workstation with a user in front of it). And the user could just reconnect if it happens that the connection is lost. <br />So yes it does&#039;t have autoreconnect and other features you would expect from a vpn-service. </p><p>But with the script I posted it runs just fine as a service. I used it in a productionenvironment for more than a year without any problems. </p><p>But I&#039;m afraid I can&#039;t help you with finding the right image to flash</p>									</div>
