					<p>Hello!</p><p>Seems like OpenWRT missing manual how to run router with opentracker. Default configuration does not allow to use tracker from a lan.</p><p>If you check opentracker source code you will find out opentracker does not use +84 udp packet offset. Which means opentracker does not read remote ip from UDP packet. Which is great for security but bad for OpenWRT behind lan users. Because they all have local IP&#039;s and local IP&#039;s would be annonced for all internet users.</p><p>&nbsp; * <a href="http://erdgeist.org/gitweb/opentracker/tree/ot_udp.c#n137">http://erdgeist.org/gitweb/opentracker/ â€¦ udp.c#n137</a></p><p>Bad? Sure it is. More then that - all local users of OpenWRT routers would not be able to communicate with internet users.</p><p>How we can fix it? I&#039;m trying to build proper firewall rule to fix this issue and this has to be wiki page or something because setting up opentracker takes a bit of magic, setup: 1) service 2) allow incomming connections 3) setup forwarind rule.</p><p>Idea to masquarade all lan traffic comming to wan IP with opentracker service on port :6969 to make it internet traffic. SNAT would be enough.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>set -e

LAN=$(uci get network.lan.ipaddr)/$(uci get network.lan.netmask)
WAN=$(uci get network.wan.ipaddr)

iptables -t nat -A INPUT -s ${LAN} -d ${WAN} -j SNAT --to ${WAN}</code></pre></div><p>So. Does anyone knows how to use openwrt firewall config to achieve this option without specifying my IP in iptables init script?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>axet</strong> on 14 Jun 2016, 21:53)</p>
