					<p>Hi all, </p><p>after having problems with my OpenWrt installation i decided to reflash the .bin on my TP-Link TL-MR3020. Unfortunately the device does not boot up anymore. So I tried to enter fail safe mode described in the wiki, but it looks like there is no chance to get the device telnetable or even pingable... </p><p>So I tried to connect to the device using a serial connection - in HTerm i can see this output: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>U-Boot 1.1.4 (Nov 28 2011 - 09:34:00)

So I tried to access the bootloader using &quot;tpl&quot; command - works. I get the &quot;hornet&gt;&quot; command line. As described in the wiki I tried to reinstall the image using tftpboot, but it does not work... looks like the wan port is not active.

					<p>Hi, </p><p>I recovered my device! Obviously a firewall blocked access on my notebooks lan port... after deactivating and reactivating lan interface in control panel a firewall message poped up. </p><p>For this process I used following software: <br /><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tftp-server/">OpenTFTPServer</a> (you don&#039;t need the service, just execute RunStandAloneMT.bat and copy the firmware .bin into the same directory. The batch file shows what interfaces are listened on and what devices try to access the tftp server)<br />HTerm (Serial Terminal)</p><p>@loco2k: Can you access the serial port? Try to watch the boot process on HTerm, it will answer a lot of questions <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
