					<p>AFAIK no, I did some survey and I was at least able to scan availabe APs on a fixed channel, but no connect. <br />You have to: replace the module-insert param with mode=sta in /etc/init.d/rt3883, supply a proper iNIC_sta.bin, iNIC_sta.dat(1) firmware in the firmware directory (where iNIC_ap.bin resides), but then I was lost, some necessary<br />iwpriv settings where not possible, maybe I took a wrong firmware, but I have no more time for further investigations</p>									</div>

					<p>@QAuge: I finally found some time to tinker with this device again.

					<p>@QAuge, @Plonk34: I lost my notes on the topic a few months ago after I had to stop on reworking/comparing /lib/wifi/ralink.sh. But here&#039;s something I immediately noticed again: Your /lib/wifi/ralink.sh is missing the code to set the wifi channel stated in /etc/config/wireless.</p><p>It&#039;s actually just one line that goes into /lib/wifi/ralink.sh, at or around line #240:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>  append vif_post_up &quot;iwpriv &#039;$ifname&#039; set SSID=$ssid &quot; &quot;;$N&quot;
  # the following line sets the channel
  append vif_post_up &quot;iwpriv &#039;$ifname&#039; set Channel=$channel&quot; &quot;;$N&quot;
  append vif_post_up &quot;iwpriv &#039;$ifname&#039; set Enable=1&quot; &quot;;$N&quot;
  append vif_post_up &quot;iwpriv &#039;$ifname&#039; set RadioOn=1 &quot; &quot;;$N&quot;</code></pre></div><p>Of note is that, for whatever reason, if wl000 is set to a channel &gt; 48 it takes about minute until the wifi shows up, maybe even longer. Also I&#039;m sure that I was able to in the past, but I can&#039;t get it to work with channels &gt;= 100 anymore, it just never comes up.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 18 Apr 2018, 00:24)</p>
