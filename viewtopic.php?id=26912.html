					<p>Currently, Fry&#039;s Electronics is selling a <a href="http://www.frys.com/product/5970674">Hitachi SimpleNET NAS Head USB 2.0 Portable Dongle - SNET</a> for $18.99 which is based on a CNS<strong>2</strong>132-250FP128-AEFF-G chipset clocked @200MHz with a 8/64 MB Flash/RAM, an RJ45 10/100Mbps, and two USB2 ports (read <a href="http://www.kiblerelectronics.com/corner/ccii_11.html">here</a>). OpenWRT has recently supported a CNS<strong>3</strong>XXX platform. If you are up to a challenge, this is a good time to start hacking into this device and come up with patches for OpenWRT to start supporting this inexpensive device. With a 64MB RAM, this device can be used to host an Asterisk PBX System, too.</p>									</div>

					<p>I second the above, have been looking at small cheap routers to use for signal hunting and travel usage. There is a win 7/XP<br />ModemGui can be used for interrogating modem while in router for signal, use AT commands to fix channel, record tower ID and more.</p><p><a href="http://whirlpool.net.au/wiki/router_openwrt">http://whirlpool.net.au/wiki/router_openwrt</a></p><p>Can confirm the 703n and variants are only approx. $20 with various sellers on Ebay and in Aus. and we have a build that does full 4G too! Great little router, portable and flexible. Some don&#039;t like it as it comes with chinese manual but there is a 3020 english modded firmware works on it in english or a few openwrt possibilities with Lucl and more. Our build supports a couple of huawei modems and also the mf821 and sierra 320u 4G (full speed). Easy enough to add modems (famous last words ...). If you are really good at fine soldering you can mod memory, chip and serial.</p><p>There is also a version for around $30 called mr 11u with built in battery pack.</p>									</div>
