					<p>As I am still playing around with my HAME MiFI F1 (<a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=46549">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=46549</a>) and looked now through several other boot-logs and information, I got almost sure, that none of those companies are producing their software themselves.&nbsp; Searching around, I figured out, that RALINK, now Mediatek has an SDK, where the manufactures can configure the firmware menudriven through all parts from u-boot, linux.kernel and all embedded tools.<br />The user manual describes a lot of hardware aspects, how you can drive certain GPIOs and configure the Soc from the running system.</p><p>Unfortunately I found up to now no source, to download the SDK (you need version 4.1.0 that RT5350 is covered).</p><p>I was only able to read in the User-Manual, but unable to download it.</p><p>When you go to the chinese search-engine baidu.com and enter&nbsp; <br />&quot;RALINK SDK 4.1&quot;<br />as search term, one of the first entries is a link to the PDF. However that is presented in a browser based reader, where you can read it in full, but print only the first 5 pages.</p><p>I found no way downloading the PDF and the corresponding SDK, as all explanations are chinese and google-translate is getting problems with a lot of javascript in this page.</p><p>Has anybody managed to get hold on those files or has an idea, where you can get it?</p><p>Regards<br />&nbsp; .g</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gnag</strong> on 12 Oct 2013, 22:21)</p>

					<p><a href="https://github.com/stevenylai/ralink_sdk">https://github.com/stevenylai/ralink_sdk</a> is SDK 3.6, that&#039;s not hard to get.
