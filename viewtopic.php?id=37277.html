					<p>Any still available? I&#039;d like to give a try at bringing them back to life.</p><p>I just had my DIR-615 rev A stop working, but the emergency flash recovery HTTP server was still operating.</p><p>Had a hell of time, even trying the <br />&nbsp; curl -0F files=@dir615_firmware_110.bin <a href="http://192.168.0.1/cgi/index">http://192.168.0.1/cgi/index</a><br />route in the page you give; all this on a Mac.</p><p>Finally tried on a PC and got the emergency room to work after it claimed I was using the wrong image; so it is possible to use that route.</p><p>Now I see hints of more recent firmware at<br /><a href="http://proisk.com/?ext=zip&amp;name=DIR615.1.14.7.RU.21122011.bin&amp;order!=dl&amp;size=6667328">http://proisk.com/?ext=zip&amp;name=DIR â€¦ ze=6667328</a><br />but don&#039;t seem to be able to get the files to try.</p><p>But with the unit just failing by itself, I am not sure it can be trusted. I replaced the main smoothing capacitor which was failing, but don&#039;t think that can be blamed.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ashiekh</strong> on 1 Dec 2012, 17:30)</p>
