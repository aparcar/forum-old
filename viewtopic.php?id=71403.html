					<p>Hi,</p><p>Just wondering if anyone has experienced something similar - I have a Technicolor &quot;TG799vac XTREAM&quot; and I&#039;m trying to JTAG it. Unlike the normal TG799vac this one runs a BCM63138 SoC with a dual core Cortex A9 ARM CPU and a nice 20pin ARM JTAG header on the board. </p><p>I&#039;ve soldered on some wires and double and triple checked they are correct, and then I&#039;ve hooked it up to OpenOCD running on a RPI. Strangely, OpenOCD finds nothing on the chain (0x0 response) when only TDO, TDI, TCK and TMS are connected. However, as as soon as I connect TRST (t-reset), it finds the following on the chain:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Info : BCM2835 GPIO JTAG/SWD bitbang driver
Info : JTAG only mode enabled (specify swclk and swdio gpio to add SWD mode)
Info : clock speed 10 kHz
Info : TAP derp1.dap does not have IDCODE
Info : TAP derp2.dap does not have IDCODE
Info : TAP auto0.tap does not have IDCODE
Info : TAP auto1.tap does not have IDCODE
Info : JTAG tap: auto2.tap tap/device found: 0x800030fb (mfg: 0x07d (Media Vision), part: 0x0003, ver: 0x8)
Info : JTAG tap: auto3.tap tap/device found: 0xf7b3a1ff (mfg: 0x0ff (&lt;invalid&gt;), part: 0x7b3a, ver: 0xf)
Error: derp1.dap: IR capture error; saw 0x0f not 0x01
Warn : Bypassing JTAG setup events due to errors
Error: Invalid ACK (0) in DAP response
Error: Debug regions are unpowered, an unexpected reset might have happened
Error: JTAG-DP STICKY ERROR
Error: Invalid ACK (0) in DAP response
Error: Debug regions are unpowered, an unexpected reset might have happened
Error: JTAG-DP STICKY ERROR
Error: Invalid ACK (0) in DAP response
Error: Debug regions are unpowered, an unexpected reset might have happened
Error: JTAG-DP STICKY ERROR
Error: Invalid ACK (0) in DAP response</code></pre></div><p>However, this is strange because it does not actually issue a Reset yet, so it shouldn&#039;t be doing any pull-up of TRST - making it odd that this is required to find the chain (unless I&#039;ve misunderstood when it issues a pull-up). </p><p>Anyone have any similar experiences/suggestions? Could JTAG be disabled on the main CPU? Is it normal/an error to discover cpus without any IDCODE?</p>									</div>

					<p>Further investigation has lead me to my current theory that 2x2 of these JTAG entries are the BCM63138 CPU and the Quantenna dual core 5ghz wifi chip. However, I believe both of them are in some way &quot;locked&quot; for JTAG through some pin in the BGA being pulled high/low or something similar. My reasoning is:</p><ul><li><p>Following the traces for TDO, TDI, TMS and TCK leads uninterrupted to some BGA pins on the Broadcom cpu, so I don&#039;t believe there are any purposefully interrupted traces to prevent debugging.</p></li><li><p>Other BCM chips are known to have configuration pins that can disable/enable JTAG or change the JTAG mode to eJTAG, etc.</p></li></ul><p>One confusing point is that both TDO and TDI lead to the Broadcom SoC, while I would have expected this to be configured in a &quot;chain&quot; between the Broadcom and the Quantenna SoC.</p><p>However for the time being I am stuck as it seems impossible to find the Data Sheet for BCM63138 as Broadcom keeps these locked up under NDA tighter then Hillary&#039;s emails.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eastwind</strong> on 4 Jul 2017, 17:27)</p>
