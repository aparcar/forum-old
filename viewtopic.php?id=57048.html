					<p>Hi everyone</p><p>What kind of console connector interface do you add to your devices to make the serial interface easy to access, and why?</p><p>I am speaking of a physical connector on your OpenWRT device, not the USB-to-serial adapter.</p><p>For example, most Cisco devices use an RJ45 plug for their serial console interfaces, while others use a standard DB9 interface.</p><p>Almost none of the cheap consumer type devices which we install OpenWRT make their serial/jtag interfaces accessible outside of the chassis, and sometimes don&#039;t even make it accessible on the board.</p><p>Considerations are likely size, cost, and ease of use.</p><p>My use case for having a console is my testing/dev devices, where it is possible that I might screw up networking or booting so bad that I need to recover from console or even TFTP/XMODEM over a fresh image.</p><p>In my case, I am mostly working with the TP-Link TL-WR710N, which you can see here: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/9QwkM">https://imgur.com/a/9QwkM</a></p><p>What I do for my devices is use a 4-pin DuPont female breadboard jumper cable, cut it in half, and solder it to the TTL pins on the board. Then I make a cutout for it somewhere on the device and glue the female connector so it is accessible from outside the casing.</p><p>Then, I use a TTL&nbsp; serial adapter rather than a 5V RS232 adapter, or a little RS232-to-TTL level adapter in between. This is cheap, the cutout size is small, and looks pretty good once I glue it in place.</p><p>I use cables like this: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/2-54mm-Solderless-Flexible-Breadboard-Jumper/dp/B00O9YBVGA/">http://www.amazon.com/2-54mm-Solderless … 00O9YBVGA/</a></p><p>Using a full-sized DB9 serial adapter would be difficult for most devices, due to it&#039;s size being large.</p><p>There are some micro-USB-to-TTL boards out there, like this one, but they are kinda costly and take up space in the chassis which you may not have:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ft232rl-Serial-Adapter-Module-Arduino/dp/B00IJXZQ7C">http://www.amazon.com/Ft232rl-Serial-Ad … B00IJXZQ7C</a></p><p>Comments?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jmomo</strong> on 1 May 2015, 01:00)</p>
