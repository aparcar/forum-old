					<p>Hi Guys,</p><p>First post but big fan of OpenWRT. Have been using it on multiple TP1043&#039;s, both the standard Backfire build, plus building my own firmwares.</p><p>I&#039;m having a problem getting MultiWAN and PPPOE working though (at least I think that&#039;s the combination messing things up).</p><p>This works fine - OpenWRT&nbsp; &lt;-&gt; DHCP &lt;-&gt; ADSL MODEM<br />This works fine - OpenWRT with MultiWAN&nbsp; &lt;-&gt; DHCP &lt;-&gt; ADSL MODEM<br />This works fine - OpenWRT&nbsp; &lt;-&gt; PPPOE &lt;-&gt; ADSL MODEM&nbsp; (obviously a different broadband provider to above. One that hands out IPs with PPPOE)</p><p>This doesn&#039;t work - OpenWRT with MultiWAN&nbsp; &lt;-&gt; PPPOE &lt;-&gt; ADSL MODEM</p><p>I just get errors in the logs indicating that retrieving an IP has timed out and it&#039;s retrying. </p><p>Any clues as to what this is likely to be. Firewall? MultiWAN itself?</p><p>I am splitting the switch into different VLANS. Could it be that? But as I say, it works fine if the router gets it&#039;s external IP using DHCP.</p><p>Thanks for any help. Matt</p>									</div>

					<p>This was due to an incorrect setting on the DSL modem. Seems there is no inherent problem with multiwan/pppoe.</p>									</div>
