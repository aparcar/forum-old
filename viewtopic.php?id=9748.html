					<p>I am trying to get php5 working with lighttpd.&nbsp; I can get both packages to compile, but when I go to start lighttpd, I get the following error:<br />2000-01-01 00:10:41: (mod_fastcgi.c.890) failed: Address family not supported by protocol <br />2000-01-01 00:10:41: (mod_fastcgi.c.1356) [ERROR]: spawning fcgi failed. <br />2000-01-01 00:10:41: (server.c.834) Configuration of plugins failed. Going down.</p><p>From what I can tell the problem is that I don&#039;t have support for unix stream sockets.&nbsp; However, I have no idea if this is because something is busted in OpenWRT or in my kernel.&nbsp; Anyone know of a way to tell what&#039;s going on?</p><p>I&#039;m doing this on a Routerboard 100 with Microtik&#039;s patch, so it&#039;s quite possible something is busted in it.&nbsp; Is there some kernel config option that could disable support for unix stream sockets?</p>									</div>

					<p>Fixed my problem.&nbsp; Turns out I was compiling unix sockets as a module and so it didn&#039;t get installed to my filesystem.</p>									</div>
