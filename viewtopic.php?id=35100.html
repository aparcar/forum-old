					<p>openssl is installed on an openwrt device and I want to do the following:</p><p>open an ssl tunnel from localhost:xxx to remotehost:yyy and keep the tunnel open. </p><p>I need the tunnel in a lua environment so I see 2 options:</p><p>- issue a command line command from lua to open the tunnel<br />- make a call by binding openssl into lua</p><p>The first option is probably the easiest, and my question is: <br />What is the command line to open such ssl tunnel? I searched the doc and source code, but can&#039;t determine what the command line syntaxt is to do it. I guess I&#039;m not looking in the right place.</p><p>In case anyone would have done the 2nd open: feel free to share your lua code.</p><p>your advice is much appreciated,<br />C.</p>									</div>
