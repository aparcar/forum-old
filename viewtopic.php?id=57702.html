					<p>Is it possible to create a virtual Wifi device and have it connect to a VPN server (pptp) while allowing all other Lan an Wifi devices to function normally without connecting to the VPN.&nbsp; I am using a TPLINK TL-WDR3600. For example:</p><p>Wifi : MyWifi -&gt; Internet via isp.<br />Lans: -&gt; Internet via isp<br />Wifi : MyVPN -&gt; Internet via PPTP Vpn tunnel. </p><p>If I need to sacrifice a lan port to VPN then I can do that but I thought I could have a virtual port do this.&nbsp; Although I haven&#039;t been able to get it to work anyway I&#039;ve tried. I&#039;m fairly new to openvpn so I&#039;m likely just missing something.</p><p>I have been searching and trying all sorts of things but I just can&#039;t seem to come up with a configuration that works.</p><p>I&#039;d appreciate any help.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

You can just change range of your DHCP server (for example - now 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.254 after 192.168.1.20 to 192.168.1.254) and for Example 192.168.1.2 set directly to your PC. Now we have IP_LAN<br />This is an example, When you have just one SSID without Vlan and Without separe subnet for VPN. </p><div class="quotebox"><cite>baxterdmutt wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>2) I am doing a separe SSID with separe VLAN with own subnet for VPN traffic, so you don&#039;t show &quot;ip ru add from IP_LAN table 10&quot;<br />for that.&nbsp; Is that correct, I don&#039;t do that for a separate SSID and Separate VLAN? </p><p>3) My ip is dynamic and they have a huge range.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know which subnet they keep us in.&nbsp; &nbsp;Is that going to affect what I enter in&nbsp; NET_LAN?</p></blockquote></div><p>In this case,&nbsp; you have separe subnet for VPN traffic and separe virtual interface. ip ru add from 192.168.1.0/24 table 10 means.
