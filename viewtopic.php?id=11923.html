					<p>Hi neighbor <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />There are a few sendmail like programs available (mini-sendmail, ssmtp) to send email from the shell. There is also a possibility of using full sendmail server. I haven&#039;t managed to build a package myself, but unslug wl500g repository does have a sendmail package and it works perfectly with WR 0.9. It&#039;s rather big, so I&#039;ve build myself a squashfs image containing all the software I&#039;d need (including sendmail and bind) - It&#039;s over 5MB so you still need 8MB router though, but it has everything <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
