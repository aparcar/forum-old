					<p>Hello! </p><p>I am on a OS X, and my router is a WZR-HP-G300NH. I am sorry if this problem is specific to OS X (wether it is or not, I don&#039;t know)</p><br /><p>But well,<br />I have a NAS hard-drive connected to my router, and I wanted to access it with samba.</p><p>When I try to connect using Finder -&gt; connect to server (command+k), it asks for my username and password, and immediately reports them as being wrong - which is not. When I try do connect with smbclient, it works perfectly! I can connect with no hassle to my NAS hard-drive. What is the problem with Finder? I have been trying to solve this for quite a long time now, and it always say my password is wrong.</p><p>It connects OK if I log as a guest. But I do have some shares that are private and should be accessed only by logging in.</p><p>What to do? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p><br /><br /><br /><br /><p>Thanks in advance,<br />Fernando.</p>									</div>

					<p>I found a solution, I will post here, hoping it will help others.</p><br /><p>To mount a Samba3 share on OS X through Finder (Connect&nbsp; to server option, or command+k shortcut), I had to type my username all in capital. Suppose it was &quot;fgielow&quot;, I had to type &quot;FGIELOW&quot; in order for it to work. It is specific to OS X, as it has worked on lowercase on both windows and on linux.</p><p>I do not know why this happens, but I was almost feeling stupid hahaha then I simply wrote all my username in capitals and voil√†</p><br /><p><img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Fernando,</p><p>I can confirm this behavior, though I have no clue on the cause.</p><p>Is there anybody who knows, why the uppercase username is required?</p><p>Anyway, Fernando, thanks for the hint <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Philipp</p>									</div>
