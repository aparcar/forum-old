					<p>My ISP is ready to allocate me a /60 IPv6 prefix.&nbsp; But I need a box to recieve it.</p><p>I am new here.&nbsp; I spent the morning searching the archives.&nbsp; I am NOT doing v6 tunneling or any 6 over 4 or other methods.&nbsp; I am getting real v6 addresses.</p><p>We will be turning my current ADSL router into a Bridge, so this box needs&nbsp; PPPoE to log onto my ISP&#039;s network to get both the IPv4 /26 and IPv6 /60 allocations.&nbsp; For IPv4 I will be using Static Routing to point subnets to my current v4 firewalls, with IPv6, well I need just about everything!</p><p>I have a WRT54Gv3 that I can start with, if OpenWRT can handle the basics and things like stateful IPv6 firewalling (and there is a GUI to work with it, even if it is something like FWbuilder).&nbsp; I would like a recommendation on a CHEAP router to use, as for this application I do NOT want wireless.&nbsp; Just a single WAN ethernet and maybe 4 LAN ethernets.</p><p>Is OpenWRT worth my time?&nbsp; Or should I throw together a Fedora Core 6 box?</p>									</div>

					<p>While I don&#039;t think I can give an authoritative opinion, I do have a suggestion..</p><p>If you have access to a linux box, or a VMware instance with it installed why not just throw together the development environment and see the available IPv6 methods available for the solution you know you need? With the menuconfig symlinks done you can see what exactly is currently available along with descriptions and the like. You won&#039;t get any sort of GUI for any of it that I&#039;m aware of, but putting in x-wrt should be sufficient for administrative monitoring purposes once you have it set up and built.</p><p>As I&#039;ve never tried to set anything up for ipv6 I can&#039;t definitively tell you if it&#039;s worth the effort or not, however, I *believe* it has support for what you seek. If it doesn&#039;t you can probably find out yourself definitely after putting 20mins into installing the required development files and building the primary make structure.</p>									</div>

					<p>openwrt can do ipv6 but some of it will need to be setup manually at this time as the configuration scripts are not complete for ipv6. <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/3465">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/3465</a> has some more info in it.</p>									</div>
