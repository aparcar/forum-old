					<p>&quot;Enterprise&quot; has more to do with providing support than hardware/software functionality. The vast majority of SMB clients don&#039;t need advanced features like BGP, EIGRP, DMVPN, etc... so it&#039;s quite possible to develop an OpenWrt-based product that can cover the functionality requirements of a lot of their SMB customers.</p><p>OpenWrt isn&#039;t an out-of-the-box solution; it&#039;s highly modular and must be tailored and configured for a specific application. A lot of middleware development has to be done... after all, Vyatta is Linux-based just like OpenWrt, but the product itself was developed to be more business friendly. </p><p>The last company I worked for used OpenWrt on our products and we regularly poached small customers from Cisco, Juniper, and SonicWall. Offer aggressive pricing and provide quality support, and you&#039;re on the right path.</p><p>That said, Cisco and Juniper innovate so quickly that they will always be several steps ahead from a technical perspective. Take a look at the authors of any internet protocol RFC from the last 10 years. Cisco, Cisco, Cisco... They will always have features that OpenWrt can never offer. If a customer needs them, move on and find a customer who doesn&#039;t.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>aport</strong> on 28 Nov 2012, 21:12)</p>
