					<p>a vlan is the logic behind physical port<br />basically you will have as many vlans as physical ports.. unless you link them together.. they are completely separated and all can have 192.168.1.1.. as subnet.. they dont communicate with each other unless you link them in which case you might have problems if all have same subnet</p><p>for you to define a link between them you have to create an interface.. which will assign an ip and a firewall zone.. the firewall zone is the link between them</p><p>so thats the theory of vlan.. and you example is good<br />regarding failsafe.. i gave you some links and a fair warning.. id read them if i were you.. you do as you please</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makarel</strong> on 9 Dec 2015, 21:06)</p>

					<p>I am going again through the installation manual of mwan3 (<a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/mwan3">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/mwan3</a>) and I see there are several steps I do not fully understand.</p><p>For example the following instructions:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>don&#039;t create a bridge over the specified interface
configure the new wan2 interface IP details
assign the new wan2 interface to the wan firewall zone</code></pre></div><p>I have not seen anywhere any &quot;bridge&quot; option that I could have selected by accident.&nbsp; So what does it mean?</p><p>Where do I configure the wan2 IP details?&nbsp; What am I supposed to enter there?</p><p>Maybe I sound hopeless, can you put me on the right track here please?</p><p>I tried to follow the &quot;firewall&quot; instructions and the end result was wrong.&nbsp; A guy sent me a screenshot and it seems that I need a WAN2 zone for the WAN2 interface.&nbsp; So I am trying to fix this.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bobptz</strong> on 12 Dec 2015, 23:05)</p>
