					<p>I am trying to set up OpenWrt on a TP-Link Archer C7 as a replacement for an old NETGEAR WG103 access point.&nbsp; (I&#039;ll be using it as an access point only, so I have no need of the Ethernet switching or router functions.)</p><p>One of the nice things about the WG103 is its ability to support multiple wireless networks (SSIDs) and map each one to a different VLAN.</p><p>Can OpenWrt do this?&nbsp; If so, how?</p>									</div>
