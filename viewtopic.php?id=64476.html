					<p>thanks for the heads up.&nbsp; so if i have created a sysupgrade.tar file from a trunk r49263 tar ball, then i need to start fresh and don&#039;t save any router setting when flashing, right?&nbsp; or i can simply include the settings i need in the /files during make image and flash without keeping setting.</p>									</div>

					<p>You are fine if you sysupgrade without saving settings and start from scratch. <br />Alternatively you could manually add those lines before the upgrade, so that you manually create the user while still using the old version.</p><p>The problem only arises if you start the router with the new version but still have the old config without the user and group.</p><p>EDIT:<br />the problem only concern firmware versions r49252-49275.<br />r49276 fixes things again.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 1 May 2016, 15:40)</p>
