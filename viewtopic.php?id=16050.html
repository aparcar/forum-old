					<p>Hi,<br />I try to set up a JRE on the la Fonera 2100.<br />I have modded the device in order to get MMc support (running fine) and 32 MB of RAM.</p><p>I use the last Kamikaze from SVN.</p><p>I downloaded the sableVM (mips version)&nbsp; package and installed it using ipkg. When executing sablevm, the process hangs using 99% of CPU and doing nothing visible.</p><p>Do i missed something (other packages, ...) ?</p><br /><p>Did anyone successfully installed SableVM or JamVM on this device ?<br />Any idea welcome ... i am stuck with, tried to compile JamVM also, but it failed.</p><p>Thanks.<br />Baz</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi there,</p><p>Since i have new results, i post a self reply.</p><p>i have definitely given up with sableVM. I have seen an unanswered ticket (in fact two) about since, i am not very optimistic about the correctness of the binary package.</p><p>Nevertheless, i have succeded in running an HelloWorld killer app. on my fonera using JamVM. It was not easy to figure out, but finally worked !</p><p>Baz</p>									</div>
