					<p>I sign into the router, go to the LED configuration screen and the only two available options (for LED&#039;s to use) include caiman:white:sata and caiman:white:power</p><p>When I was using the one from the Kaloz location, there were more options available and the wrt1200ac has more than just power and sata.&nbsp; It has 2.4ghz, 5.0ghz, usb1, usb2 and of course wan (not to mention the four ports but not sure if those can be software controlled).</p><p>Is there a way to re-enable/add the ones missing from the drop down menu?</p>									</div>
