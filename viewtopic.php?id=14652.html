					<p>Hello.</p><p>Just installed kamikaze 7.09 on my linksys wrt54gl. Everything went fine but after the installation i was wondering how to install asterisk. There is no asterisk package at the moment it seems. There are a few postings here in this forums regarding asterisk but not realy a solution to install it. I tried zandbelts overlay but without success. So anybody who can push me in the right direction?</p><p>regards<br />t.</p>									</div>
