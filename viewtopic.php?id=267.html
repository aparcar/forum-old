					<p>For various reasons, I decided to go with OpenSSH rather than dropbear on my build.&nbsp; To do this, I added zlib openssl openssh to OPENWRT_TARGETS in openwrt.mk.&nbsp; It built great, and after creating passwd, group, and shells like the dropbear ipkg does, I can ssh in just fine.</p><p>But one of the reasons that I installed OpenSSH was to get scp.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t really seem to be working.&nbsp; If I scp from a PC to the openwrt, it creates the file in the right location, but it is zero length.</p><p>Any idea what is going wrong or is missing?&nbsp; Anyone else have scp working?</p>									</div>

					<p>I am the one who modified those openssh patches to work in the buildroot for OpenWrt.</p><p>scp is fine but the uClibc has a bug. The ftruncate() function used by scp is not working. Thus scp copies a file to wrt and then truncates it to length 0. The ftruncate() is used by other programs but so rarely that this problem was missed.</p><p>andersee fixed the uClibc bug, I didnt have time yet to test it. It will be available shortly in th CVS.</p>									</div>

It works (for me) with some of the dropbear .ipkgs floating around somewhere (i dont remember the version). If you like to give it a try - i have attached it as zip file.<br />You can upload it with nc (netcat) to your OpenWRT box.</p><p>HTH</p>									</div>

I made the changes required to build all openssh components including scp, ssh client, sftp, sftp-server etc. Simply include zlib, openssl and openssh in the PACKAGES variable and a series of .ipks will be built containing zlib, libssl, sshd, ssh etc.</p>									</div>
