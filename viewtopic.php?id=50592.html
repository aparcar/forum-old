					<p>Hi all</p><p>I am getting errors after building a plain OpenWRT build that doesn&#039;t contain any packages.&nbsp; I just select the hardware and then build from that.&nbsp; </p><p>The first weird thing is that it doesn&#039;t contain any wireless config at all.</p><p>I then add a wireless config from a working board, and now I am getting:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>....
