					<p>Hi ,</p><p>I have TL-WR841ND V9.2 flashed with the newest OME firmware from TP-link (TL-WR841ND_V9_150310) , I have found that my router is supported with a note (14.07 has slow wifi - upgrade to chaos calmer) , also i am reading some topics at the forum now related to other versions of my router , it seems there are a lot of troubles that may brick the router , and reverting to the OEM seems not as direct as updating from an OEM Firmware to another , I want Openwrt for some advanced QOS , so at which degree is the slow wifi is ? are there any other issues ? should i wait for chaos calmer ?</p>									</div>
