					<p>I have just flashed this build onto my new WRT1900ACS and all is working fine.</p><p>This is my first ever experience with OpenWRT, so I apologize if this is covered elsewhere, but I have an external USB 3.0 HDD which I would like to connect to the router in order to be able to use it as the default location for new software packages (as the router&#039;s internal flash memory is limited), as well as a swap file.</p><p>Is this possible with this particular build, and if so, could somebody please point me to some information, or preferably, some sort of guide to set it up?

					<p>@all - I just compiled this firmware using the latest lede repo. I&#039;ve been customizing my own builds for the last few weeks, and I only tried @arokh&#039;s configuration recently. I&#039;m not sure if all the patches went through - they didn&#039;t my first attempt, I still need to upload my second. I&#039;ll share config / env info for anyone who wants to try it out. The cake patches aren&#039;t necessary anymore, they&#039;re in lede&#039;s buildroot (and some experimental sqm-scripts), and @arokh&#039;s config is not a 1-1 match with lede, but it&#039;s pretty close and lede keeps adding new features. They&#039;re building nightly releases with their buildbot: <a href="http://phase1.builds.lede-project.org/builders">http://phase1.builds.lede-project.org/builders</a></p><p>releasing vanilla snapshots here: <a href="https://downloads.lede-project.org/snapshots/targets/">https://downloads.lede-project.org/snapshots/targets/</a></p><p>I started small and slowly worked up to where I am now, feeling more confident about it.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think Iede snapshots are being churned out a few times a day? Whenever one of the buildbots is triggered:<br /><a href="http://phase1.builds.lede-project.org/builders">http://phase1.builds.lede-project.org/builders</a><br /><a href="http://phase2.builds.lede-project.org/builders">http://phase2.builds.lede-project.org/builders</a><br />seems to run all day. That&#039;s honestly why it&#039;s &#039;sort of&#039; unstable. But it&#039;s all good in the end. If I judge the quality based on the best build I&#039;ve used, Lede is far more stable and less buggy and worth using, but right now I&#039;d only recommend it for devs. It has potential once it&#039;s finished.</p><p>@arokh&#039;s build has a few modifications that we know work on the latest release here. It&#039;s stable and consistent - so porting and maintaining some of these patches would be a b=**CH if if trunk / lede is not consistent. But if you don&#039;t need / or aren&#039;t using those patches - and some of the new bug fixes support is better on lede - then lede might be worth looking into. It has a patched DHCP that&#039;s lets you customize what routing info is sent to different machines by mac or ip-space (i dunno if this is also in openwrt trunk but it could be patched into it). </p><p>also, one suggestion about improving this build would be including black-roland&#039;s repo : <a href="https://github.com/black-roland/exOpenWrt">https://github.com/black-roland/exOpenWrt</a> - which has the latest dnscrypt-proxy / libsodium and support for multiple dnscrypt name spaces (it&#039;s nice to have two dns in this way). I&#039;m still trying to stablize my own env. - my latest creation died yesterday (docker) - but I am still experimenting with different combinations of stuff... (the new adblock package has decent firewall rules that block ipv6 ads and force connections to the local dns). So if anyone wants to experiment / help teach / learn I&#039;m interested, but again my opinion hasn&#039;t changed.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>moxu</strong> on 9 Aug 2016, 22:37)</p>

					<p>Also, just to clarify (forgot to mention it above) - the patches that modify anything about the transmission power or frequency of the antenna, especially 5GHz - that is being locked down and router manufacturers are required to build routers in such a way that opensource firmware can&#039;t change those settings. Some distributors got lazy and tried to &#039;prevent&#039; (wtf? haha) people from uploading open firmware. Other distributors, like the linksys wdr that this project is named after, just modified their routers, because it&#039;s technically O.K. to upload open firmware, and in most parts of the world technically um.. not OK to modify the strength / channels of the attenna. I assume lede is complying with international specifications on this issue so as to&nbsp; be&nbsp; socially acceptable... specifically that&#039;s why the older trunk - with the patches here - is going to be more stable and work properly - because (I don&#039;t know exactly how it works) it&#039;s probably going to become more difficult to patch that, although i doubt it&#039;ll be impossible for current routers, maybe future routers will actually separate it physically.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>moxu</strong> on 9 Aug 2016, 23:00)</p>
