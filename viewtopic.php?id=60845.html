					<p>Hi all,</p><p>would need some guidance here.. </p><p>I have flashed:</p><p>openwrt-15.05-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr841nd-v1.5-squashfs-factory.bin</p><p>through the router gui. The first try it complained about the name being too long. then I have renamed to:</p><p>wr841nv1_wr841ndv1_en_3_3_6_up(150310).bin</p><p>and probably it was a bad idea. The router seems to start up, but it is not responding to 192.168.1.1<br />I see I can start it up in failsafe mode (the sys led keeps blinking fast) but don&#039;t see anything I can do with it.</p><p>I couldn&#039;t find anything related to my version yet.. Is the router just bricked and useless?</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>									</div>

					<p>Try with wireshark (and turn the firewall off). A blinking &quot;Maintenance&quot; LED is usually a good sign.<br />If the upload failed, the router may by defaults be configured to 192.168.0.1 (at least TL-WR741ND is and those two are relatives, AFAIK.).<br />Any ARP requests in wireshark, when booting the router with reset key pressed?</p>									</div>

					<p>hi epek,</p><p>tried that as well, nothing in wireshark. According to the router lights, everything looks fine, I can even see the lan port, where the laptop is connected, blinking; also if i connect it to wan port it will light up.<br />DHCP does not work (no replies at all)<br />192.168.0.1 nothing as well<br />192.168.1.1 same.<br />Tried failsafe and check wireshark, nothing received.</p><p>I&#039;m wondering if the name of the image could be related to this issue..<br />I guess last try would be opening the router and connect a cable as I have seen in other posts (not sure that one supports it though)</p><p>Thanks for your help guys</p>									</div>

					<p>@mmc79:<br />Blinking LED for the switchport seems to be available in any state. The relevant leds are config, wlan, usb, etc - but if these aren&#039;t initialized there&#039;s no clue...</p><p>I recently bricked a tl-wr1043nd by flashing it with a self-assembled image (ImageBuilder, probably oversize through sysupgrade). The first time I could use the serial to recover it, but the second time the soldered pin got loose with parts of the PCB... Despite having flashed a new factory firmware, that should contain the new bootloader, I could get it to answer My brick is similar to what you describe, at a first glance, but I have never had a wr841n and the 741nds I had where difficult to restore - until the 4.21 I just recovered.</p><p>Please see the other thread on debricking, pls. <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=60775">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=60775</a><br />Some hints there may help in your case, too.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your advise epek!</p><p>Will investigate a bit more.. At least the sys light behaviour is quite normal and i also see it blinking faster when pressing qss button to enter to fail safe mode. </p><p>About wireshark, i see arp packets from my laptop asking who has 192.168.1.1 but no replies.. The interface starts sending packets while router is booting (when it detects the router is back after reboot), i guess this means the lan ports are ok.</p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mcc79</strong> on 12 Nov 2015, 09:20)</p>
