					<p>I&#039;ve been using OpenWrt (WhiteRussian) on a WRT54G for years. Recently we got a new ISP and the WRT54G can&#039;t cope with the speed. So I bought a D-Link DIR825; it&#039;s an European model. It says rev B2 on the sticker, but the stock firmware says B1.</p><p>I have an Asterisk box on my network. It has a few internal phones connected and several &quot;outside&quot; phones (those are located with my family). We use this to call each other free of charge and it has worked quite well for years.</p><p>However, with the new DIR825 I&#039;ve got a new version of OpenWrt: Kamikaze (r23885). Although it looks quite easy I can&#039;t get ALL the outside phones to connect to my Asterisk. One phone always connects: that one is using a different source UDP port (since his modem is blocking 5060). </p><p>I read on the forum I might need to add kmod-ipt-nat-extra for NATting on port 5060. After I did that 1 other phone also connected. </p><p>But I&#039;m still missing several phones.</p><p>So then I tried to install dd-wrt. That worked fine for my Asterisk box, but the router hung itself every few hours. So dd-wrt was not really working for me either (I tried to get it more stable by disabling several things, but it always crashed in the end).</p><br /><p>So now I&#039;m back with OpenWrt and hoping some of you can help me. I&#039;m probably missing something very basic, because it seems so easy to setup a few port forwards, right?</p><p>Anyway, this is what I&#039;ve installed: a port forward for SSH, for FTP, for Voip on UDP ports 5060-5070 to internally 5060, voip-rtp ports 10000-20000 and a few ports for Bittorrent (7000-7100). All of those forwards go to the same internal machine: 192.168.2.250.</p><p>I&#039;ve used LuCI to enter the forwards in &quot;Traffic redirection&quot;. I tried a rule in &quot;traffic control&quot;, but that didn&#039;t work either.</p><p>This is my /etc/config/firewall file:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;defaults&#039;

					<p>Some thoughts:<br />- A sniffer (tcpdump -ni eth0 &#039;udp port 5060&#039; -s 1600 -w /tmp/sip.cap) may run on PBX server and see if remote sip traffic comes in.<br />- Open a Asterisk console and run &quot;set verbose 3&quot;&nbsp; or even &quot;sip debug&quot; to catch more diagnose messages.<br />- If your remote sip phones are behind a firewall, &quot;nat=yes&quot; should be set at your sip configuration for those peers.</p>									</div>

					<p>Last night I took a look at the capture file. Lost of packets, but none coming from the not working phones. So I called one of them (the others were not home). Asked them &quot;have you tried turning it off and on again?&quot;, let them take a look at the the username in the phone (which is not quite as easy as it sounds) and stuff like that. It still wouldn&#039;t register.</p><p>But this morning, at 5 o&#039;clock local time it did register! Apparently all by itself... Strange, right? I&#039;m pretty sure I haven&#039;t been sleepwalking and changing my OpenWrt settings.</p><p>I can see the familiar failing to register due to &quot;no matching peer found&quot; lines in my Asterisk logfile too. It makes you think that perhaps somewhere else (at the ISP? an internet-exchange?) someone had configured some kind of firewall too tight and they relaxed it again.</p><p>I still have one phone not registered, but they are not home so I&#039;m hoping they just unplugged it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> </p><p>I&#039;m actually a bit sorry that I haven&#039;t found anything I did wrong as that would be the most logical explanation why it didn&#039;t work before.</p><p>Anyway, thanks for all the help!</p>									</div>
