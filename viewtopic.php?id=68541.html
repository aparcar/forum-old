					<p>Pull out the cable! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> , don&#039;t bridge the two networks...<br />More clues as to what you are trying to achieve might be in order. ie access to wan? is there a wan? isolating wlan-&gt;lan and/or lan-&gt;wlan, allowing any services from router to either network (dhcp?) etc.<br />Without going to detailed, the more info about what you are trying to do and what with makes it a lot easier to provide some sort of relevant answer.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>greybeard</strong> on 15 Nov 2016, 07:55)</p>

					<p>Sounds like you&#039;re trying to make it to complicated with vlans.<br />Set up your network with LAN -&gt; WAN as you want it. Then duplicate it for WLAN to WAN. That&#039;s it.</p><p>To keep LAN separate from WLAN don&#039;t make any forwards/bridges between them.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;d make all forward = reject.</p><p>If in doubt, try reject and either make explicit rules to accept (better practice but can be time consuming to configure and probably over kill for domestic use) or change to accept.</p><p>Zone rules are the sledge hammers of firewall config, traffic rules getting down to small hammer, port forward pretty much for nat stuff, custom rules are for masochists <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Best security practice is to deny everything and only allow bare minimum both in/out and to/from a firewall. For domestic type firewalls reality is to usually allow anything to exit the firewall to the wan, Only allow specific ports back into the lan from the wan if you have servers that require it.</p>									</div>
