					<p>I&#039;m working with Samba 3.6 as fileserver on my Netgear WNDR3800 and a mixture of Win7- and Win10-Clients and XUbuntu with Samba client without any problems.<br />So I see no direct dependency for Samba 4 to use with Windows 10.</p>									</div>

					<p>You&#039;re probably seeing now problems because you still have SMB1 enabled. With the Wannacry ransomware, there were major recommendations to turn off SMB1.</p><p>With SMB1 turned off, Windows 10 uses encrypted SMB3_11 for &quot;browsing&quot; via Network [Neighborhood], so while you can make manual connections via &quot;NET USE&quot; and &quot;Map Network Drive&quot; (which will fall back to SMB2), you can&#039;t browse computers via Network [Neighborhood] without a minimum of Samba 4.4</p><p>Samba 4.5 is going to be included in Debian Stretch which is released on the 17th.</p><p>Now regarding it not fitting on a router, sorry, I call BS on that one, especially modern routers with 128MB, but that doesn&#039;t even take into consideration those with exroot setups.</p>									</div>

					<p>Agree. It&#039;s now time to include samba 4 on OpenWrt. The default has also changed on the samba client for up-to-date distros. For instance, on Ubuntu 17.10 I&#039;m getting:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Default has changed to a more secure dialect, SMB3 (vers=3.0), from CIFS (SMB1). To use the less secure SMB1 dialect to access old servers which do not support SMB3 specify vers=1.0 on mount.</p></blockquote></div>									</div>
