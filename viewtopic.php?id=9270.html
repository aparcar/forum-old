					<p>Hi folks,</p><p>I&#039;ve just put together a simple QoS solution, mainly to allow for VoIP prioritisation.&nbsp; It basically uses the same stuff that nbd&#039;s qos-scripts does except without using IPtables- in actuality it&#039;s a modification of the script &quot;astshape&quot; I found, mainly because qos-scripts doesn&#039;t work in RC5 and I can&#039;t be stuffed upgrading.&nbsp; Note that in its current form it is not very flexible, unlike qos-scripts.&nbsp; It has no config file or anything that funky - you just punch some numbers into the script itself after installing it and some of the queuing packages.&nbsp; I can say though, that it makes VoIP work even under high link utilisation.</p><p>I&#039;ll put an .ipk package together shortly but if anyone is interested immediately post here and I&#039;ll send you the file itself, plus instructions.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kaldek</strong> on 1 Feb 2007, 13:41)</p>

					<p>OK folks, here are the quick &amp; very dirty instructions to get this working before I have an .ipk put together (and some documentation in the QoS documentation page).&nbsp; Before you do <strong>anything</strong>, make sure you have disabled any other QoS scripts on your router.</p><p>First, install all the stuff needed to make it work.&nbsp; The &quot;kmod-sched&quot; package includes all the QoS kernel modules (these are used by nbd&#039;s qos-scripts package as well).&nbsp; The script itself just needs to be placed in /etc/init.d and will be one of the last boot scripts to run.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ipkg install kmod-sched
cd /etc/init.d
wget http://www.users.on.net/~ed.luck/S98astshape
chmod 755 S98astshape</code></pre></div><p>Next, edit the script and punch in your download and upload speeds (in Kilobits per second) into the script at the top where it says &quot;DOWNLINK&quot; and &quot;UPLINK&quot;.&nbsp; The author has his own recommendations regarding the figures, but I leave the DOWNLINK value at my line speed (i.e 8192 for 8Mb/s ADSL).&nbsp; The UPLINK value is recommended to be set as your uplink speed minus 15%.&nbsp; I would say start at this value and then increment it up to your line speed, monitoring call quality (during high load) as you go.&nbsp; Finally, make sure you enter the name of the *external* interface of the router after the DEV field.&nbsp; Here is an example:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>DOWNLINK=8192
UPLINK=325
DEV=ppp0</code></pre></div><p>After this, just reboot your router and the queues are configured.&nbsp; Note that the script has a few assumptions, those being:</p><p>1.Your VoIP devices sets its TOS value to 0x18 or 0xb8<br />2.Your Asterisk server port is 4569</p><p>Finally, here is a few disclaimers!&nbsp; I&#039;m still learning about QoS myself, and found this to be an easy way to start learning, as opposed to nbd&#039;s scripts which are too complex for me to comprehend right now.&nbsp; The script also does stuff which I think is probably overkill, such as dropping incoming packets from the Internet when the line speed is reached.&nbsp; This will obviously be a problem for ADSL users whose line speed will potentially change all the time depending on what speed the modem syncs at.&nbsp; For now, I suggest setting the DOWNLINK value to the maximum possible speed under your ISP&#039;s plan that you purchased.</p><p>Because this is a learning process for me, I will be both documenting this in the QoS document wiki page and using it to help me learn about nbd&#039;s qos-scripts, to which I will also (hopefully) find the time to document properly for &quot;dumb users&quot; like me.&nbsp; Give me a week or so though - it&#039;s my anniversary and I need to have a dirty weekend with my wife.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kaldek</strong> on 1 Feb 2007, 23:47)</p>

					<p>Hey Kaldek,</p><p>I have two SIP devices at home, I&#039;ll see how it goes. </p><p>Have some questions tho -- what&#039;s the TOS and how do I set it on Linksys WIP300 and Sipura SPA-3000? </p><p>Also, I believe most SIP servers by default run on the port 5060, should 4569 be the local port then?</p><p>Thanks,<br />-Stan</p>									</div>
