					<p>Hi, I am using wrt54gl. </p><p>yesterday, i was changing some configuration in /etc/config/network , firewall and /etc/firewall.user. After changing, I noticed that my dhcp server does not assign me any IP. So i rebooted the router. The outcome still the same. </p><p>Next, I try to reset the router by pressing on the reset button for awhile.. The outcome still the same.</p><p>I try to enter failsafe mode. I managed to enter in, but I can&#039;t ping nor telnet to 192.168.1.1 I already give my computer a static IP. </p><p>Next, I try to see the serial output. The output give me weird response. A few lines follow by blinking of screen then output character by character. I also try to interrupt it by pressing ctl-C. There is no effect though. </p><p>Is their anyway I can save my router?&nbsp; What is actually happening to my router? </p><p>regards,<br />ian_wk</p>									</div>

					<p>Maybe you screwed something in /etc/config/network...</p><p>If you have access to router serial console, you&#039;re done! Garbage output usually means wrong serial line settings (often speed), if it either doesn&#039;t respond to key pressing, the router is still booting and hanging somewhere because of wrong /etc/config/network?</p><p>Right serial settings are 115200,8,n,1</p><p>Don&#039;t worry about the router, you can either flash bootloader too.</p>									</div>

					<p>First build a jtag cable according to <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/openwrtdocs/customizing/hardware/jtag_cable">http://wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/openwrt … jtag_cable</a><br />Then use <a href="http://www.wlan-skynet.de/docs/ortsverteilung/wrt54g/skynet-repair-kit.shtml">http://www.wlan-skynet.de/docs/ortsvert … -kit.shtml</a> (it worked for me with wine)<br />Is it all that bad? I mean if the bootloader is coorupted. If so you need anyway a correct bootloader for flashing...</p><p>Did you try with the serial settings i wrote?</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks rAndy <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>The setting for the serial is correct.. The ground wired is loose thus leading to weird output.. In regards to the problem that I can&#039;t ping.. This has got nothing to do with the openwrt.. </p><p>I use another laptop and managed to atftp in a new image. Thanks for your help.. </p><p>The problem with my laptop is :: I am assigned an IP with all the necessary gateway information but I can&#039;t seem to connect to any webpage nor can I ping my router. This laptop got 2 boot partition: 1 is window vista while the 2nd is ubuntu. In vista I got no problem accessing web or ping. once change to ubuntu the problem arise.. I am connected but no access this is weird.. any one encounter this problem?</p>									</div>
