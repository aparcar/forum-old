					<p>@davidc502 Firstly thank you for all your work on this project.

Please let me know if I can assist troubleshooting in any way. </p><p>I also really appreciate your responsiveness in including Wget for the DDNS client for the next build. </p><p>I noticed Nano is also missing on the most recent build, and I wasn&#039;t able to find any other text editors.

Openwrt has really strict kernel checksumming based on kernel options used in compilation. In practice you can&#039;t install packages from the snapshot repo to a private build. You can only installed packages from the same compilation run as the kernel itself.&nbsp; (you may override that with &quot;opkg --force-depends&quot;, but that may brick the router if there is an actual incompatibility.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 16 Oct 2016, 21:55)</p>

					<p>I think part of the confusion is that in previous builds the distribution feeds used to reference <a href="http://downloads.lede-project.org">http://downloads.lede-project.org</a> and in new builds they are already pointing to <a href="http://davidc502sis.dynamic-dns.net">http://davidc502sis.dynamic-dns.net</a> by default. </p><p>In my case after after updating I need luci-proto-relay to get my configuration working which isn&#039;t in David&#039;s repo. </p><p>I&#039;m not sure what the best practice is for this.

					<p>Also, with the new build, there a small fix I put in for nslookup. Currently nslookup with busybox are not working correctly, so I put in a small script that creates a new nslookup file and renames the original to nslookup.old. So, just in case you need to go back you can. The old file is just a symbolic link that calls busybox, and can be added back easily if needed. </p><p>With the workaround, people who use ddns are no longer affected by this bug.
