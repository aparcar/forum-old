It will not work as router but as wifi AP. Just disable DHCP server on TP-LINK, change its IP on LAN to 192.168.178.xx (for future managing) and&nbsp; connect Main router to LAN ports of TP-LINK.</p>									</div>

					<p>Read the very first line of the link you referenced.&nbsp; You do not have a Atheros chipset in your TP-link. </p><p>I suspect that the radio in your device is not called &quot;wl0&#039; so the iwlist failed (what was the error).&nbsp; Look at the wireless file and find the name of the wifi-iface=&gt;option device value.</p><p>HINT: use an SCP program (WinSCP, etc) to find your config files in \etc\config\</p><p>What is your primary router and is it on OpenWrt?</p><p>For better help you should be more specific with the exact things you try and the replies you get.</p>									</div>
