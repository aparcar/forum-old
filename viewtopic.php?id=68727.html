					<p><strong>Marco</strong>, remote router is not your router, it is another router? If you want to connect to remote router, it should have real IP, so to get real static IP via 3G it is not possible, to my mind.</p>									</div>

					<p><strong>Marco</strong>, I don&#039;t understand completely. At home you have router running OpenVPN SERVER, and from modem Huawei HG553 running OpenVPN CLIENT you are connecting to the home router? Which two cases have you described, when OK and doesn&#039;t work?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello ulmiwind sorry for my english but I use google translator<br />I have not spoken of vpn, I can not configure VPN between Fritzbox and openwrt.<br />I would like to reach the interface luci openwrt remotely<br />and even 8080 for MJPG<br />doing the tests I saw that if the router openwrt and connected to the WAN of the router Fritzbox and I rule portforwarding port 80 on the Fritzbox then OpenWRT is accessible remotely.<br />If I connect to the router OpenWRT stick modem (Huawei E3251)<br />Every rule I do on the openwrt router firewall can not reach the router.<br />Some say that the door 80 is closed, but I think it&#039;s not true because I tested the connection between two PCs connected to two routers with teamviewer it works .... also does the VPN<br />Can I set the fixed ip addresses to the modem? I can add rules of portforwarding the modem?</p>									</div>

					<p>Some providers block common service ports like 80, 21, etc. Try using a non-standard port above 1023.</p><p>Also check if the modem is connecting you to internet (has public IP address) or to a CG-NAT. If it is CG-NATted then try setting up IPv6 for that.</p>									</div>
