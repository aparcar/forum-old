					<p>I was wondering how I can install OpenWRT on my Raspberry Pi&nbsp; (21 Inc Bitcoin Computer actually) on top of the existing OS. </p><p>I was able to&nbsp; get a bootable image of the OpenWRT on my SD card (Using these instructions <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/raspberry_pi_foundation/raspberry_pi)">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/raspberry_ â€¦ pberry_pi)</a> and have OpenWRT run on my Raspberry Pi but I really just wanted to install the software on my existing image (SD card). Is that possible I can&#039;t seem to find any documentations.</p><p>I apologize if that&#039;s a dumb question. I am new to this and have very limited developing and Linux skills</p><p>Marc</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you @kem! It does seem like a hack. Wouldn&#039;t that mean I would have to run a daemon with a separate root. I really want to keep the current OS the way it is and just add OpenWRT to it. It seems hard to believe that I&#039;m the only one who wants to do that.</p>									</div>

					<p>I take it what you would really like to do is basically just run the OpenWRT gui (Luci) on top of Raspbian (or whatever OS you&#039;re running on the pi)?</p><p>OpenWRT is designed to run as a standalone OS and isn&#039;t compatible in this way.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I guess I am trying to do that. It really just started because I would like to get this Wifiportal21 (<a href="https://github.com/aantonop/wifiportal21">https://github.com/aantonop/wifiportal21</a>) running.</p>									</div>

					<p>You should be able to run wifidog straight on the pi.</p><p>Just configure it as an AP (obviously you&#039;ll need a suitable wifi adapter) and install the wifidog package.</p>									</div>
