					<p>Hi -</p><p>I am very new to this and don&#039;t really know how to debug this. I loaded the latest for this router and now 5GHz radio sometimes works sometimes not. I have tried playing around with the various settings and get no consistent results. Rebooting doesn&#039;t seem to help, sometimes it works on a channel sometimes it doesn&#039;t. I&#039;ve searched for this topic and found nothing that helps. Any ideas where to look or how to proceed?</p><p>Thanks</p><p>JCB</p>									</div>

					<p>First, look in the logs, if there is anything that might help you.</p><p>You can also consider using LEDE instead of OpenWRT, which might (or might not) have better results. I have the same router as you and it runs stable enough without any major problems.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, I tried flashing tapper&#039;s image and the router is now bricked. I have tried the power on / power off four times trick and still cannot connect on ethernet. I would open up the router and use the serial cable... but I can&#039;t figure out how to open the case. I took off the only four screws I could find on the bottom of the case but there doesn&#039;t seem to be any way to open the case. Any ideas?</p>									</div>
