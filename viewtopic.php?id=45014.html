					<p>Hi,</p><p>I use Gargoyle 1.5.10 factory and tried to install:<br />minidlna - 1.0.24-1 - MiniDLNA (aka ReadyDLNA) is server software with the aim of</p><p>I get the following error:<br />ERROR: Dependency libffmpeg of package minidlna cannot be found, try updating your package lists</p><p>So I&#039;ve listed the libffmpeg libraries available:<br />libffmpeg-custom - 0.8.7-2 - FFmpeg is a a software package that can record, convert and stream digital<br />libffmpeg-full - 0.8.7-2 - FFmpeg is a a software package that can record, convert and stream digital<br />libffmpeg-mini - 0.8.7-2 - FFmpeg is a a software package that can record, convert and stream digital</p><p>When I try to install libffmpeg-mini and after that minidlna I get the same error. If I unistall libffmpeg-mini and install libffmpeg-custom and minidlna, same error.</p><p>If I try the same with libffmpeg-full I get this error:<br />ERROR: Dependency kernel (= 3.3.8-1-d6597ebf6203328d3519ea3c3371a493) of package libffmpeg-full is installed,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but has incompatible version 3.3.8-1-418b0c9a3d2b0325109c4c9dd8680699 and is marked as &#039;hold&#039;</p><p>Any suggestion on what can I try next. Is there any other DLNA server implementation other then minidlna?</p>									</div>

					<p>you cannot install kernel dependent openwrt packages by default in gargoyle.<br />you could try installing it with &quot;â€“force-depends&quot; but you could have other strange errors later.<br />best thing would be to build your own gargoyle from source with minidlna included or just revert to openwrt and install packages normally</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your answer.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried with force depends but it behaved the same.</p><p>opkg install --force-depends minidlna</p><p>I think building your own is a bit too much hassle for the result.</p><p>So you say rewriting the firmware with a basic OpenWRT and reconfigure the stuff would be the same, and gargoyle can be installed afterwards? I&#039;m not a gargoyle fan-boy or something, just thought to get the easy way around with the config&amp;setup.</p><p>My aim is to have a stable router firmware TL-1043ND with a USB HDD connected and exposed as shared drive for the PC/Laptop and for the TV through DLNA.</p>									</div>
