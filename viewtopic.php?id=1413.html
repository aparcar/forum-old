					<p>Howdy,</p><p>I have been searching for a solution how to get syslog data from OpenWRT to a remote MySQL server, and I was wondering if anyone had any experience with this? I found two IPK packages that seems to have related functionality ; msyslog and sysklogd-sql, but I was not able to get either of them to work under OpenWRT and I could not find documentation how to get them to work under OpenWRT. Any good ideas?</p><p>Regards,<br />Sebastian</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ssjoholm</strong> on 2 May 2005, 00:21)</p>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m the package maintainer of msyslogd and sysklogd-sql. I did not tested them when they were ported so that you may encounter issues running them. What about this documentation ? :</p><p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=12845&amp;group_id=25741">http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_d â€¦ p_id=25741</a></p><p>I hope this helps. I&#039;ll try to find the time to make a documentation about this two softwares</p>									</div>
