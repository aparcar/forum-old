					<p>Hello,</p><p>I bought a used TP-Link Archer C7 router. When I got it home and plugged it in, I get no LEDs lighting up whatsoever. </p><p>I disassembled it and tested voltage at the plug/socket, which reads 12v. So, I know I&#039;m getting power to the board. </p><p>I did try hooking up a USB to UART/Serial cable to the pins on the board based on guides seen on this forum, but I am not seeing any output from it when booting the device. </p><p>A quick inspection of the board shows no damage. I do notice that when I plug the power cable in and turn the router on, the USB LEDs on the back light up for a fraction of a second but then shut off. </p><p>I&#039;m assuming this board may be shorted out or have a bad capacitor, but didn&#039;t know if anyone else had any other suggestions on what to test/look for?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
