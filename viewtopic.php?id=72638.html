					<p>Hello, </p><p>First, I don&#039;t know if it is the right topic, sorry if it is not the good place.</p><p>I recently acquired a Hootoo TripMate Titan and I&#039;d like to use it as a remotely accessible NAS. I wonder if it is possible to make that happen thanks to your services. <br />I&#039;ve read that I&#039;ll need a DDNS, so if anybody can tell me the steps to install my NAS on the Titan, I&#039;d be very happy!<br />The idea is that I&#039;d like to access a Hard Drive connected to the Titan from anywhere in the world, provided I have an Internet connection.</p><p>Thank you really much for your help!</p>									</div>
