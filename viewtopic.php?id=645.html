					<p>OK... we&#039;ve got a pre-pre-pre-pre beta version of NoCatAuth</p><p>It&#039;s been developed out from the NoCatSplash for ewrt in C. We didn&#039;t want to cope with the makefiles and so... and we just modified the open.c file (open version of the nocat gw) to be captive, but not name change of the function at all (as I said, not to have to manipulate the makefiles...)</p><p>We spect to improve the coding and all that staf...<br />For the moment, there&#039;s a problem when freeing memory, inherited from the original code of NoCatSplash.</p><p>We&#039;d be pleased if someone could test it and gave some feedback on bugs...<br />Pleas, be comprehensive, it&#039;s not ready yet <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p><p>Anyone ready to test it? Ask for it here: yurgi.arginzoniz@air-bites.com... nowhere to hang it yet. And don&#039;t have it in this PC right now... I hope we will post it here tomorrow or so...</p><p>Thanks to everybody interested!!</p>									</div>
