					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am&nbsp; new in OpenWRT and unfortunately confused on where should I start.<br />I want to develop a monitoring&nbsp; application on Compex 344 router board to be able to monitor any MAC level frame of Wifi interface.<br />Could you please let me know where should I start? Is there any tutorial on architecture , development road map and so on.?</p><p>Regards</p>									</div>

Virtually any resource (book, web page, etc.) that describes how recent versions of&nbsp; Linux handle the network stack will give you good information.</p><p>I do *not* recommend the Linux Advanced Routing &amp; Traffic Control site.
