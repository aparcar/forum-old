					<p>WRT54G v.2 here. OpenWRT White Russian RC6.</p><p>My problem is as follows.</p><p>Out of the blue, my router got stuck in a continuous reboot cycle. With no apparent cause, it started a boot cycle, flashing the power led, then lit up the DMZ led, as is normal, then ...briefly flashed the WLAN led before rebooting and starting the procedure all over again.</p><p>After many failed attempts, I booted into failsafe mode and disabled the wifi interface. (I must note at this point that I have broken the bridge between LAN and WLAN, keeping the two interfaces -vlan0 and eth1- separate.) The change I made was at /etc/init.d/S40network and was as follows:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>OLD:  ifup_interfaces=${ifup_interfaces:-&quot;lan wan wifi&quot;}
NEW:  ifup_interfaces=${ifup_interfaces:-&quot;lan wan&quot;}</code></pre></div><p>The router booted ok in normal mode, with the wireless interface disabled.</p><p>Now, after I SSHed into the router, I tried the following commands:<br />ifup wifi -&gt; result: nothing.<br />ifconfig eth1 up -&gt; result: router rebooted!<br />wifi up / wifi down / wifi -&gt; result: router rebooted!</p><p>My NVRAM variables are as follows:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>os_ram_addr=80001000

					<p>I reflashed OpenWRT and the problem was temporarily fixed.</p><p>Temporarily, because a week after, it resurfaced. I can&#039;t get <em>eth1</em> up no matter what. I suspect a bad power adapter because it almost always happens after a power failure, and I read somewhere that maybe eth1 draws too much power for a cheap adapter to compensate; I&#039;ll try replacing it.</p><p>One other thing is that syslogd doesn&#039;t give me any useful information (no kernel panic messages). I considered making a JTAG cable and seeing if I can get anything from there, but a) it&#039;s not worth the effort and b) I don&#039;t even know if it&#039;ll help me.</p><p>If anyone has any suggestions, I&#039;m all ears, because this problem has been plaguing me for weeks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>snathan</strong> on 14 Feb 2007, 20:22)</p>

					<p>Have you checked your power supply? The WLAN needs more power, therefore a defective capacitor can be enough to trigger a re-boot. On the other hand, broken support for your HW in diag.c can cause the same trouble!<br />/T</p>									</div>
