					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I have been trying for the past 5 hours or so to assign multiple IP addresses (each with their own interface labels) to a single port (eth0) on my Raspberry Pi2B (running openwrt obviously).</p><p>All I want to do is have these three ip addresses and labels:</p><p>eth0 - 192.168.10.2 /24, GW=192.168.10.1 (this is facing my DSL router, which has an IP of 192.168.10.1)<br />eth0:0 - 10.0.0.100 /24 (this is facing my client ranges)<br />eth0:1 - 192.168.100.1 /24 (this will have squid listening for some http redirects using iptables)</p><p>My issue is not so much putting this into /etc/config/network but rather, it seems that I cannot ever reach any alias IP addresses. Even if I set my laptop to 10.0.0.50 /24 and ping 10.0.0.100 /24, I don&#039;t get any response. Additionally, ifconfig doesn&#039;t show the aliases. I have done this on ubuntu without breaking a sweat but I am stuck and would appreciate some help.</p><p>Why can I not reach these aliased IP addresses (I can easily access whatever eth0 is set to) and why are they not showing ip in ifconfig. Am I missing something, can openwrt not handle aliases properly?</p><p>Thanks so much!</p>									</div>

					<p>I have managed to do it via the GUI, just incase anyone else is having the same issue. Not sure why it works here and not in the CLI, usually its the other way round when it comes to this kind of stuff. I noticed that ifconfig doesn&#039;t show the additional interfaces after they are created though so don&#039;t let that alarm you. If anyone has a better solution (i don&#039;t really like relying on the GUI, was going to remove it actually), please feel free to contribute.</p>									</div>
