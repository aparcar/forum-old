					<p>Hi! I&#039;d like to try OpenWrt on this router (Aztech HW550-3G) but for me this is the first time I install OpenWrt from scratch (I had only experiences on Foneras). <br />How can I do this?

					<p>I&#039;m not sure if you will get to satisfying results this way, since you miss out the board specific stuff. I&#039;m not too experienced with the buildroot, so I don&#039;t see a legal way to select the yet existing target profile of your device. What I would do is looking for the Kconfig- and Makefile which points to that &quot;default&quot; target profile stuff and change it to the Kconfig and Makefile mentioned <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/26123">here</a>.</p>									</div>

					<p>I searched every single page that talks about hw550-3g and I haven&#039;t found a target profile for my device.<br />I have doubt about the patch you mentioned because it seemed to me (reading mailing list) it was added in trunk and I taught it was outdated (it is 7 months old).<br />I&#039;ll try to apply the patch anyway hoping not to brick the device...<br />Do you know where I can find a list of basic packages I have to include before building final image?</p><p>UPDATE:<br />I built the image successfully.

					<p>I would also recommend to backup your flash before you flash anything unstable.<br />If you have a current trunk, you don&#039;t need to apply that patch. I just wanted to point out where it is located and what it contains. You need to get to know how the buildroot configuration files work, so you can include those files in the patch.</p>									</div>

					<p>I learned a lot in these days and I managed to build my custom firmware, compile the SDK and packets. It is very funny and an important technical experience.<br />Thanks to this I installed OpenWrt trunk on my Fonera 2.0n via ssh flashing, but I&#039;m still stucked with HW550-3G cause I don&#039;t know how to flash. The only post that talks about it refers to serial but I didn&#039;t understood if it is mandatory or they were working with it only for the initial board approach while ethernet wasn&#039;t working (now it has been fixed).</p>									</div>

					<p>To flash the Aztech HW550-3G (from the default Ralink firmware) w/o a serial cable:</p><p>1.
