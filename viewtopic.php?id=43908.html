					<p>Hi, I got this brand new shiny TL-WDR7500 from China only to find out that it is in... chinese! I tried to have a google translation of every phrase written but it is highly impractical and at times I am not sure that i am pointing to the right translation. The information I got from the hardware wiki: <br /> TP-LINK TL-WDR7500 AC1750 Wireless Dual Band Gigabit Router Archer C7R <br /> 3x3:3 802.11ac radio, 3x3:3 802.11bgn radio <br /> 4x Gigabit LAN, 1x Gigabit WAN, 1x USB 3.0, 1x USB 2.0 <br /> Qualcomm Atheros based v2 (Broadcom v1?) <br /> Announced at CES 2013 (via SmallNetBuilder) (v1?) <br /> CES: AC-router TP-Link (v1?) <br /> nl.hardware.info CeBIT article on the device <br /> I am assuming this is an Atheros based SOC , I could be of course wrong. <br /> I wanted to know if there was any possible firmware in english I could use, TP-link tech support informed me that the english firmware is meant for another hardware and is incompatible with the chinese model: mine! I intended to flash it with a third party firmware if feasible, thus my question. <br /> Any other idea, help, would be much appreciated. <br /> Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenWRT doesn&#039;t seem to support the TL-WDR7500. Try to flash with the english version anyway, that said, have a way to unbrick the device if it fails (eg. serial console, jtag etc.)</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey jungario</p><p>You can find Archer C7 firmware from here, <a href="http://www.tp-link.com.au/support/download/?model=Archer+C7&amp;version=V1#tbl_j">http://www.tp-link.com.au/support/downl … n=V1#tbl_j</a><br />I think they are using same hardware so it can be compatible. I tried flashing wr941nd firmware to wr941n (Chinese version) and it worked perfectly OK. Hope this help you.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you nicholaswu, appreciate your help, I knew about it by following this thread: <br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=44201&amp;p=2">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 01&amp;p=2</a><br />@kirschwasser: do you have any new info about&nbsp; qca9558&quot;s find: &quot;It looks like the most recent version of compat-wireless that just went into openwrt mainline has ath10k support. So as long as it&#039;s being compiled into the kernel and the firmware is present on your openwrt-7500/archer-c7 wireless ac + 5ghz should all work!&quot;<br />Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>I have no such device and no more info. Do the devs have anough ath10k devices? Time? Interest?</p><p>Since the ath10k should be mainlined in 3.11 (or 3.12) and ac-clients (Laptops, Phones, etc) are spare, no biggie.<br />Also note that without a working DFS (Dynamic Frequency Selection), most 5GHz-Channels will only be used passively or not at all!!!</p><p>Don&#039;t know what takes so long with that DFS. Maybe they are just lacking manpower.</p>									</div>

					<p>first make sure you have greasemonkey installed and that it is enabled<br />it should look like this: <br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jKhShFbtzQk/TewR_owTjzI/AAAAAAAASiM/SUqqugnJVHs/s1600/mw13.gif">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jKhShFbtzQk/T … 0/mw13.gif</a></p><p>Then you install&nbsp; the TL-WDR7500 translate script and the Greasemonkey menu should show that the script is running instead of &quot;No installed scripts run on this page&quot; placeholder.</p><p>If you do not get to this step check the IP addr of the router (default is 192.168.1.1)</p>									</div>
