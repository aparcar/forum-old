					<p>Hello,</p><p>I installed Kamikaze 7.07 on a wrt54g Version 2, that worked without problems.</p><p>Now I want to do the following:</p><p>The hosts (whoms traffic I want to forward to a WLAN) hang at the switch of the wrt. The wrt shall connect to an existing WLAN (IP via DHCP) and tunnel the traffic from the hosts (LAN) to that WLAN and vice versa. So it looks like that:</p><p>| LAN hosts | &lt;---traffic---&gt; | wrt54g | &lt;---traffic---&gt; | 3rd party WLAN |</p><p>I edited the /etc/config/wireless, set channel, ssid and so on. But I&#039;m unsure about the mode. Which mode do I need for the WLAN Interface? (sta... because the wrt54g should act as a client to the 3rd party WLAN?) <br />How can I tell the wrt to get its IP with DHCP? I tried it in the /etc/config/networks by adding an entry for &quot;wl0&quot; but after that, the WLAN router distributed IP (I got a DHCP server, but I dont want to offer DHCP, I want to get a IP from the the 3rd party WLAN for the wrt54g.)<br />Do I have to set the masquerading rules for forwarding traffic from the LAN over the wrt to the 3rd party WLAN with iptables? <br />Or is there a configuration file for that?</p><p>Thanks for your help!<br />Sorry for my poor english,<br />Best regards</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>xaver</strong> on 13 Sep 2007, 01:36)</p>
