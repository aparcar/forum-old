					<p>May be it&#039;s a dump question but this is really matters for me , I have setup my router (Nexx-wt3020f) and installed all packages i need and it was hard for me to setup some stuff like sharing usb devices with samba and device drivers (usb to serials for example) as i&#039;m a beginner to openwrt so every time i reset the router configuration to default i have to spend hours to search for each problem, so my question is :<br />Can I set the current contents of SPI flash as the factory default ? I backed up the spi flash by desoldering it and saved it&#039;s contents to my computer by using a spi flash programmer and when something goes wrong in the router i reflash it with the previous image i saved in my computer but I&#039;m sure there is an easier way to load the spi flash image but don&#039;t know how. any help would be nice.</p>									</div>

					<p>You will have to take your specific configuration files and put them in an image. A firmware image contains a SquashFS file system, and SquashFS is read only. Images work by writing the SquashFS to flash, and then creating a JFFS2 partition (supporting read/write) to store the changes you make and packages you add. When the device is reset the JFFS2 partition is erased, and it starts over with only the SquashFS contents.</p><p>So to have your specific config as default, you need to get your changes inside SquashFS. You do this by building your own image. See <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/about/toolchain#documentation">about/toolchain#documentation</a> to learn how to use the build system, or <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtain.firmware.generate">doc/howto/obtain.firmware.generate</a> to learn to use the prebuilt image generator. The programs you want to include you select as packages, and each build approach has a way to include custom files, where you put configuration files and scripts that are not part of a package.</p>									</div>

The two advantages of putting it in the image is that it&#039;s in place after a reset (which can be good or bad), and it benefits from SquashFS compression.

You could try dumping the relevant MTD blocks. Look at /proc/mtd to see what blocks are relevant, here&#039;s mine as an example:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> cat /proc/mtd

mtd3: 001d0000 00010000 &quot;rootfs_data&quot;
mtd4: 00010000 00010000 &quot;art&quot;
mtd5: 007d0000 00010000 &quot;firmware&quot;</code></pre></div><p>Kernel/mtd1 is the kernel, rootfs/mtd2 is the SquashFS base file system, and rootfs_data/mtd3 is your JFFS2 filesystem that contains your changes. You could try dumping these with </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cat /dev/mtd{1-3} &gt; /path/to/dump/mtd{1-3}</code></pre></div><p> and writing them back to the corresponding device. In fact, you should only need to dump rootfs_data unless you have flashed a new image.</p><p>I don&#039;t know if <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/mtd">doc/techref/mtd</a> can write flash dumps (you would use the friendly partition name (e.g. rootfs_data instead of mtd3)). Either way you probably need it to unlock the block before writing to it.</p><p>Note that I consider all of this to be experimental, flash dumps as a means of config management isn&#039;t the usual or recommended approach. As you already have a complete flash dump you probably know how to recover from a mistake, so have at it if it looks like what you want.</p>									</div>
