					<p>Hi All, </p><p> I own a TPLink 3600 with an Installed OpenWRT 12.09 Release 0.11.1 Kernel Version 3.3.8. Starting the normal 2.4ghz wireless is not an issue and all devices (dell atitude 6430 and nexus 10) can find the wireless network. Starting 5ghz will bring (status in the router) the wireless network up, but it can&#039;t be seen by all my devices...changing channels 36,40,... doesn&#039;t help. Do I have a chance to find out if the network is really up and running? Or is there any other trick which I have overseen? Any help would be really appreciated. Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>It mainly depends on what region your devices come from. If lower channels don&#039;t work then try higher channels 149 or 165. My nexus 4 could not see the 5g radio when it was using lower channels i.e. 36,40.&nbsp; So 149 turned out to be the sweet spot for all my devices.</p>									</div>

					<p>Then it could mean your clients (devices) wireless is registered for some other country code via 802.11d so you need to reset them to Germany.&nbsp; Happened with my macbook pro.
