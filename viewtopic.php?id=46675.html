					<p>I&#039;ve been working on getting OpenWrt up and running on my DGND3700. </p><p>I&#039;ve been using Barrier Breaker r38302 and can get it up and running, usual<br />limitations obviously with ADSL, 802.11n and 5GHz.</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=212426#p212426">this post</a> explains how to get the 4 LAN ports to work but they do not work<br />as expected. That configures it so that in the switch config that port 5 is all the lan<br />ports and VLAN does not work to associate 1 port as WAN.</p><p>With a little bit of hacking around the kernel I have managed to get each port to<br />work on their own, but they are unusable past plugging it in. The port aside from<br />being on does not do anything further. The WAN port when set in a VLAN is not<br />able to get a DHCP lease, and the LAN ports do not issue leases.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[   13.420000] bcm63xx_enetsw bcm63xx_enetsw.0: link UP on WAN1, 100Mbps, full-duplex
