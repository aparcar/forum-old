					<p>Kamikaze does not use NVRAM and you can&#039;t change NVRAM variables from within Kamikaze with a 2.6 Kernel.</p><p>Attach a serial console and change the NVRAM variables directly in the CFE bootloader console or flash a Kamikaze 2.4 image change NVRAM and reflash with Kamikaze 2.6 image.</p>									</div>

And how exactly are you trying to reflash? It sounds like you are on some sort of Broadcom unit (e.g. Linksys, Asus). In this case, as long as you are able to get to the OpenWrt command line, e.g. using telnet over ethernet, then you can reflash it using something like this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># cd /tmp
# wget http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/7.09/brcm-2.4/openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx
# mtd -r -e linux write openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx linux</code></pre></div><p>This will erase the flash, write the new image, and reboot. Wait a few minutes before trying to connect again.</p><p>If wget doesn&#039;t work (e.g. because you don&#039;t have a default route) then use another way to get the image file into /tmp, e.g. set a root password and then use scp to push the file from your PC to the box.</p>									</div>
