					<p>Hi Folks,<br />I&#039;ve been following the instructions from <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/dg834.g/b">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/dg834.g/b</a> to install OpenWRT on a DG834G v2.&nbsp; Everything has gone exactly as per the instructions up to the point where you ftp the parts of the SquashFS image to the router.&nbsp; Unfortunately at this point I&#039;ve come to a halt because there does not appear to be anything on the router actually listening for ftp requests.&nbsp; When I try to ftp to it, I get a connection refused error (and I did a simultaneous tcpdump to confirm I was getting an RST in response to the ftp client&#039;s SYN).&nbsp; I can still telnet into the router, and ping its IP address (which is 192.168.0.1, I haven&#039;t changed from the default).&nbsp; On the router itself I can&#039;t see any process that looks like an ftp server running (though I&#039;ve never been on one of these before so my inexperience could be misleading me I suppose).&nbsp; I&#039;ve searched through the closed DG834G forum but haven&#039;t found anything like a similar problem.&nbsp; Has anyone seen this before or got any suggestions?&nbsp; Apologies in advance if I&#039;m missing something obvious here, I am very much a newbie to OpenWRT.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Mark</p>									</div>
