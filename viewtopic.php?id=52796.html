					<p>I live in a place where several people share one modem/Wifi router. I don&#039;t like that for security reasons. I think it&#039;s too promiscuous. So I kind of fixed the problem this way:</p><p>My notebook connects to the shared Wifi router, but all my email and most websites run through an SSH tunnel. Fine.</p><p>But I also like to use my phone and tablet over Wifi.</p><p>I had an old TP-Link Wifi router here, so I hooked it up to the notebook over Ethernet, and now the phone and the tablet are securely routed through my private router and notebook. That&#039;s also good because I can share files across the phone, tablet and notebook more securely, not going through the &quot;promicuous&quot; router.</p><p>The problem with that is that the notebook has to be running all the time. If I turn it off, the phone and tablet can&#039;t access the Web anymore.</p><p>Well, I just got another, newer TP-Link router. It has WDS. So does the shared router. So I could make the new router get connection from the shared router and distribute the signal to my private devices and give the notebook a rest, but: 1) WDS requires that both routers have the same SSID and password, which defeats the purpose of my little private network; 2) No SSH tunnel.</p><p>This newer router is supported by OpenWRT 12.09.</p><p>Questions: if I install OpenWRT, can I </p><p>1) turn the router into a repeater/access point that will do what my notebook has been doing, i.e. redistribute the signal but with different SSID and password, so I have my own private network without the notebook?</p><p>2) run the SSH tunnel in the router, so the notebook can be turned off sometimes?</p><p>3) Is that too hard to achieve? I am a seasoned Linux user, but not a very advanced one. Networking always gives me a headache.</p><p>TIA</p>									</div>

					<p>1) It should be very possibleâ€¦ you need two separate SSID/passwords on the same OpenWRT-device, and depending on your router and your needs that can be more or less complicated.</p><p>2) OpenWRT is very capable of running SSH tunnels. Your tunnel goes to something on the internet that you trust? If you connect to your work or something you are just fine. But if the traffic comes out of the tunnel unencrypted and on the internet, not so much is perhaps gained.</p><p>3) I don&#039;t think it is too hard to achieve. You mostly need to reconfigure one of your wireless networks on the OpenWRT router to act like the WLAN, and then preferably but your OpenWRT in bridged mode (rather than NAT) to avoid double NAT.</p>									</div>

					<p>What if I just use it to </p><p>1) Get the wireless signal from a distant router</p><p>2) Pass it to another router over an Ethernet cable?</p><p>Would that be easier? I am not particularly concerned with the double NAT.</p>									</div>
