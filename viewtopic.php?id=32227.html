					<p>I&#039;m not sure if all the stuff you listed is supported, but your requirements are all software-requirements. <br />So if it&#039;s supported by openwrt, any router (with wifi) should be able to run this. If it&#039;s not supported than no router will be able to handle it.<br />You have to look if all needed modules and libraries (mostly iptables/netfilter) are available. <br />Which hardware depends only on your budget and performance-needs (throughput, encryption,...), but first you should check if openwrt can meet your software-requirements.</p>									</div>

					<p>Carl,</p><p>I&#039;d second eleon216&#039;s suggestion. Your requirements are nearly all software-based and any Ethernet-based OpenWrt device (nearly all of them) will suit your needs. I&#039;d suggest looking at:</p><p>- Netgear WNDR3700<br />- Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH<br />- TP-LINK TL-WR1043ND</p><p>These are all fully supported by OpenWrt, are relatively inexpensive, have five gigabit Ethernet ports, and a relatively fast CPU.</p><p>Hope this helps,</p><p>Sam</p>									</div>
