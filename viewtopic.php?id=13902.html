					<p>Those problems are not fixed as of 10/1/2008 (svn trunk). Unfortunately this is the only thing that is preventing me from using openwrt, since i rely on pptp vpn connections a lot.</p><p>Now i really wonder why the developers, instead of fixing fundamental flaws like this, would begin work on porting openwrt to other platforms like the OLPC. After all isn&#039;t openwrt a router OS?</p><p>/edit<br />I know i shouldn&#039;t be demanding things, but the bug has been around for more than half a year. It is extremely frustrating since it was first reported more than a year ago for white russian, and while it was fixed then, it broke again in kamikaze.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cruciz</strong> on 13 Jan 2008, 05:44)</p>
