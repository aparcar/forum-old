					<p>@david, great news!&nbsp; r6565 is running great on my WRT1200ACv1.&nbsp; I had an uptime of well over 2000 hours on r5501, but finally had the chance to upgrade <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Only one very, very minor thing I noticed.&nbsp; I saw you had built busybox with wget.&nbsp; This is great (just as you had done with the diff command) as you no longer need the wget package; however, it makes wget not work with the -N flag (which only downloads if the file has been updated) that I use in my script to auto-update the dnscrypt-proxy file.&nbsp; I was able to delete the included wget from busybox and install wget from the repo which worked fine for my purposes.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have the chance to look at the moment, but there may be an option, something like wget-extended or wget-full that you could also enable in busybox, so that wget will be the full version.</p><p>Regardless, all my settings carried over fine, and everything is working perfectly.&nbsp; And thanks for keeping AMSDU disabled!</p><p>Just FYI cause I know you use dnscrypt also, they came out with a new version (which isn&#039;t out for routers yet), along with a new website, and the new version uses a completely different format in the dnscrypt-proxy resolvers file.&nbsp; And they also removed any trace of version 1.x from their github as well.&nbsp; However, you can find the most up-to-date (and still being updated) one that we need here thanks to @dyne: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyne/dnscrypt-proxy/master/dnscrypt-resolvers.csv">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyne/ … olvers.csv</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>starcms</strong> on 2 Apr 2018, 12:32)</p>

Though is don&#039;t see any improvement beyond 27 db when I do have a larger scale to choose from. Either I get 23db as my max, or 24db, or 27db or 30db as my max. It&#039;s a crap shoot when getting 5.8 to function with changes, and i must mix region and fiddle with max gains on both to enable 5.8ghz.
