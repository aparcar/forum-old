					<p>For noob-ish users like me.</p><p>Until Chadster gets the chance to update his firmware, you can sort the LED lighting issue as follows:</p><p>1. WARNING!!!

Get WinSCP from here: <a href="http://winscp.net/eng/download.php">http://winscp.net/eng/download.php</a></p><p>3. Open a SCP connection to your router with WinSCP.</p><p>4. Navigate to /usr/sbin folder.</p><p>5. Right click on &quot;wan_monitor&quot; file and select &quot;EDIT&quot;</p><p>6.

					<p>@rachwalj/everyone, </p><p>First time poster here and i&#039;ve been reading through this and I must admit i&#039;m not the best at this HOWEVER i have loaded custom firmware before, and I do understand the instructions on <a href="https://github.com/Chadster766/McWRT">https://github.com/Chadster766/McWRT</a> where i must run update.sh then make for the BIN file to be generated. Couple of stupid questions though:</p><p>1) I think i know a way to download the entire &quot;attitude adjustment&quot; folder using some linux commands, however i&#039;m curious how i might go about doing this on a windows computer?<br />2) Any recommendations on what tools to use so can build the latest bin on my windows machine?</p><p>Thanks so much in advance and pardon my ignorance.</p>									</div>
