					<p>My setup is 1 Windows 2000 PC, 1 linux 2.4.28 box (old webserver) and a new linux 2.6.15 box (new webserver) all hooked to a Linksys WRT54G v2 router. I am running White Russian RC4 on the router which is connected via PPPoE to my DSL provider.</p><p>I copied the default firewall.user before editing it, so I have reverted back to the default settings. I checked with iptables -L my rules were gone.</p><p>Here is what I do in my internal LAN.</p><p>1) Surf to <a href="https://www.dyndns.org">https://www.dyndns.org</a>/ <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- sometimes I get there, sometimes I get &quot;Connection reset by peer&quot;. If I get the latter I can reload to actually get the page. Seems to be similar to this problem I found on the net. (<a href="http://www1.nl.squid-cache.org/mail-archive/squid-users/200007/0010.html">http://www1.nl.squid-cache.org/mail-arc … /0010.html</a>)</p><p>2) Surf to <a href="http://www.rbcroyalbank.com">http://www.rbcroyalbank.com</a>/<br /> - No problems</p><p>3) Choose &quot;Online Banking&quot;, which has the URL (<a href="http://www.rbcroyalbank.com/RBC:Q-DFJY71A8YAAHnuVrk/redirect-bank-hp-pagelink-olb.html">www.rbcroyalbank.com/RBC:Q-DFJY71A8YAAHnuVrk/redirect-bank-hp-pagelink-olb.html</a>)</p><p>Firefox says &quot;Connected to server&quot; and hangs, IE justs waves its flag, I tried Links under Gentoo linux and it says &quot;SSL negotiation&quot; and hangs.</p><p>None of the machines are sharing an IP so I don&#039;t think it is IP collisions. Also it only happens with SSL pages.</p><p>The downloads getting slower is more of an impression, probably shouldn&#039;t have posted that without actual numbers. Sorry.</p>									</div>

					<p>What the f*&amp;^? Why?!</p><p>The router doesn&#039;t know or care about which traffic you send out*; it doesn&#039;t block any outgoing requests. The firewall is intended to improve security by blocking connections from the internet to the router, it does not block connections from the router (or machines behind it) to the internet or the replies sent back on those connections. Connecting to an https (SSL) site just means that your machine connects to port 443 and sends an SSL encrypted http request, at no point should the https server attempt to make a new connection back to your router or your lan.</p><p>The lines you&#039;ve removed from the firewall are to explicitly block anyone from establishing a new connection back to your router; it&#039;s a security mechanism which has absolutely nothing to do with https.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t know why your so upset this doesn&#039;t reduce security in any way that I can see, the connections are still rejected, but not with a tcp-reset.</p><p>In other words the original S45firewall scripts says</p><p># reject (what to do with anything not allowed earlier)<br />iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset<br />iptables -A INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-port-unreachable</p><p>if I change it to</p><p># reject (what to do with anything not allowed earlier)<br />#iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset<br />iptables -A INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-port-unreachable</p><p>the connection is still killed.</p><p>My guess is when a redirect to a different HTTPS comes in it is not seen as associated with the previous connection therefore it does not go through FORWARD but rather INPUT and then is tcp-reset. </p><p>All I know is with the reject lines uncommented the Linksys router is unusable, but I comment them out and I can browse all the sites I used to.</p><p>As Frankie says &quot;Relax&quot;</p>									</div>
