					<p>Hi to all,</p><p>I&#039;m totally new to OpenWrt and got a LinkSys WRT160n today. The first thing i did, was to have a look, if i could use OpenWrt with it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />Unfortunately i did not found any useful info, so i searched the web, to find out what it&#039;s about this device. As i found, that it has a Broadcom chipset, i assumed i have to use WhiteRussian to be able to use wireless. Hardwarespecifications found at <a href="http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/myincludes/new_page.php?cheap_11n_router_roundup_table_router.htm">http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/myinclud … router.htm</a> told me, that it is nearly the same hardware as the WRT150n, which is listed to work with Kamikaze here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware#head-6b2369a6aabba3642915213936b680fdedcffe0d">http://wiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware … fdedcffe0d</a><br />So now i&#039;m a bit confused, where to start. I tried with openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx and with openwrt-wrt150n-2.4-squashfs.bin, both without success.<br />Is anybody out there, who owns such a device or someone can give me a hint, where to start?</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p><p>groovy</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenWRT is best thing since sliced bread!</p><p>I have some hacking skills and wrt160n box. I&#039;d like to help with working OpenWRT&nbsp; wrt160n compatible firmware.

I do see during boot that wrt160n bootloader indeed waits for 30 sec, yet&nbsp; I experience the same issue as bigon while trying to TFTP burn original Linksys image over DD-WRT: the firmware is accepted and ACKed, but reboot never happens. After power cycling DD-WRT is still there.</p><p>How can I troubleshoot TFTP burn procedure? Does bootloader leaves any traces/logs?<br />Please advice how could I recover wrt160n from bad firmware burn? </p><p>Your thoughts are welcome. Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>I have broken my wrt160n by flashing a SVEASOFT TALISMAN firmware to it. It would boot and look to be working but i could not ping it (at 192.168.1.1) or anything. Even plugging a cable into a port would light that port number up. But I tried everything I could think of and could find on the openwrt wiki and elseware on the internet and it would not respond.</p><p>Eventually I tried using tftp to upload the firmware from the linksys website. It would not accept any firmware. Also boot_wait was not on. I did the unspeakable and pressed a metal object against the pins on the flash chip. and with a lot of fiddling around I managed to get an image tftp&#039;d back into the router. The commands I used I recorded on my wiki page. -&gt; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/WestleyPaynter">http://wiki.openwrt.org/WestleyPaynter</a></p><p>I wish I could be more descriptive about exactly what I did but I did everything more than once so I am not sure what actually worked. (obviously I don&#039;t recommend shorting things out inside the WRT, it was a last resort in my case.) But if you flashed your wrt160n and it stopped working, don&#039;t give up because it may be less fragile than previously thought.</p><p>If you learn anything new about this device please add it to the wiki page.<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WRT160N">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har … ys/WRT160N</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Here is a patch I made to allow detection of wrt160n and enabling some LEDs and the buttons. The WLAN LED still doesn&#039;t seem to work tho.</p><p><a href="http://snipes420.googlepages.com">http://snipes420.googlepages.com</a>/</p><p>Openwrt shouldn&#039;t think it is on a &quot;WRT54G/GS/GL&quot; anymore. It was tested on Rev12384. Networking is working better now (not due to this patch but I think due to overall fixes to the platform).<br />I can connect to the device at 192.168.1.1 on the LAN as long as I disable the firewall first.

					<p>Hi to all,<br />I&#039;m currently working on a WRT160n v2.0 device and have already bricked and recovered it back several times <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> AFAIK it&#039;s not possible to run any version of OpenWRT on a v2 WRT160n since it is based on a Ralink processor. What I&#039;m trying to do is to simply get a telnetd running on this device. I have downloaded the GPL&#039;ed firmware code v2.0.02.011 from Linksys GPL code center (available from a link on page <a href="http://www.linksysbycisco.com/US/en/support/WRT160N/download)">http://www.linksysbycisco.com/US/en/sup … /download)</a> and tried to get the telnetd which is part of the busybox software running, with no success. I&#039;m not even sure whether I have been able to successfully spot the location of the startup scripts. There is a script named rcS in folder /etc_ro and I have placed some initialization code for telnetd together with the actual invocation of the deamon in this script but I suspect that this script itself is executed. (Regarding to my last statement, I have placed the line, echo &quot;HO.&quot; &gt; /www/test1.html, into this script and built the firmware, then uploaded the new firmware to wrt160n v2 and finally pointed my browser at <a href="http://192.168.1.1/test1.html">http://192.168.1.1/test1.html</a> and got a 404 - not found.)<br />Could anybody please point me the right direction for installing &amp; getting telnetd running on a WRT160n? Thank you.</p>									</div>

I have found it to be invaluable in testing on unsupported devices. with one you can usually login to the device at the command prompt and poke around.

I have found it to be invaluable in testing on unsupported devices. with one you can usually login to the device at the command prompt and poke around. Regarding your question, I do not know about the init process of that routers stock firmware. What arch is that processor? is it mipsel like the broadcom soc&#039;s in the wrt?<br />Good luck <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p></blockquote></div><p>Hi again,<br />I tried but haven&#039;t been able to install a serial port on my WRT160n v2 device. Using a multimeter, I figured out a +3.3V, a ground, and two more pins and using a level shifter, I connected them to my PC, but I could not see any messages coming while the router was booting. Worse, I am not even sure if I could figure out how to connect to those pins because they seem to have been soldered out (if it&#039;s ok to post pictures here, I can post close-up pictures of those pins). </p><p>However,&nbsp; I have been able to get telnetd working and been able to login in a quite dirty way. What I did to achieve this was to replace one of the daemon binaries being started by the firmware&#039;s init process with a small script that starts the telnetd. The chipset used on WRT160N v2 is reported to be Ralink&#039;s RT2880F on dd-wrt&#039;s hardware site.</p><p>However, now I&#039;ve hit another obstacle. We are trying to establish an 802.11n mesh networking testbed and I (believe, I) need to put the radio into IBSS (adhoc) mode. The driver controlling the radio is rt2860v2_ap and again I believe this version of the driver does not support the IBSS mode. Linksys does not provide the source code of rt2860v2_ap module and instead, the firmware source just contains a binary image of the driver. I think I need to get the rt2860v2_sta driver compiled &amp; running on this device. I have even found the source code for rt2860v2_ap and rt2860v2_sta v1.5 drivers in the GPL source of the firmware of Airlink ar670w and cross-compiled them and put them into the firmware for WRT160n, but when I load these drivers, they complain about the firmware version numbers. By the way, the original rt2860v2_ap driver provided by Linksys in the router firmware is 1.6. </p><p>How can I get help on compiling the rt2860v2_sta driver for WRT160n v2 or on obtaining a precompiled image? I&#039;ve emailed Linksys for this issue, and I got a quick reply stating that they do not provide support&nbsp; for GPL code. I have also emailed Ralink support but did not get a reply yet. In fact, I don&#039;t think that the driver&#039;s complaining about firmware version is related to the driver&#039;s own version (the original driver provided by Linksys reports to be of version 1.6, the rt2860v2_sta driver I have found in the source code of Airlink ar670w&#039;s firmware is 1.5). Maybe, I just could not get the driver built in an appropriate way. What do you think about this issue? </p><p>Thank you for sharing your time.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ulucinar</strong> on 6 Feb 2009, 20:29)</p>
