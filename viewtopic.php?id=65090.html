					<p>Hi all,</p><p>instead of &quot;self-generated&quot; TLS certificates, I&#039;d like to use &quot;Let&#039;s encrypt&quot; certificates. Are there already any best practices, how to include them,...? I never used / added TLS certificates to a server.</p><p>Do I just have to create them and copy the .cert and .key file to the directories configured in /etc/config/uhttpd? Or are there still steps to consider?</p><p>What I don&#039;t like that much is that I always get a warning, when I enter the routers luci frontend. So it&#039;s not that big issue, but if there&#039;s a possibility to &quot;fix&quot; this, I would like to do that.</p><p>Thanks and kind regards,</p><p>Dirk</p>									</div>

					<p>You have to convert the certificate to the format uhttpd understands. See <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/certificates.overview">here.</a><br />Then you simply copy the cert and the key to, let&#039;s say,&nbsp; /etc/tls/ and configure uhttpd to use them.</p><p>My setup looks like this and works fine:</p><p>in /etc/config/uhttpd:</p><p> config uhttpd &#039;main&#039;<br />#&nbsp; &nbsp; list listen_http &#039;0.0.0.0:80&#039;<br />#&nbsp; &nbsp; list listen_http &#039;[::]:80&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; list listen_https &#039;0.0.0.0:443&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; list listen_https &#039;[::]:443&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option redirect_https &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option home &#039;/www&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option rfc1918_filter &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option max_requests &#039;3&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option max_connections &#039;100&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option cgi_prefix &#039;/cgi-bin&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option script_timeout &#039;60&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option network_timeout &#039;30&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option http_keepalive &#039;20&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option tcp_keepalive &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ubus_prefix &#039;/ubus&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option cert &#039;/etc/tls/uhttpd.crt&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option key &#039;/etc/tls/uhttpd.key&#039;</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>groovy</strong> on 25 May 2016, 13:22)</p>

					<p>I just tried to create the certificates with &quot;Let&#039;s Encrypt&quot; on my own. It didn&#039;t work for me on openwrt with an error. As I read I had to download &gt; 40 MB additional tools. I think that&#039;s too much for my router. &quot;Let&#039;s encrypt&quot; sound to me like a very good idea, but like many Linux features it&#039;s not sooo user friendly for non-pros <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>I expected the &quot;Let&#039;s encrypt&quot; guys would offer a GUI where I can easily create my certificate. What a pitty they didn&#039;t. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

					<p>But that&#039;s the point of Let&#039;s Encrypt, to do away with authentication, GUIs and all other sorts of processes. No authorization, no payments, no GUIs, just a public host they can directly validate and a matching set of scripts. That removes all sorts of barriers. They are not primarily trying to provide free certificates for everyone and their dog&#039;s IoT-enabled tag, they are striving to make the <em>public</em> web secure.</p><p>It has never been intended to replace self-signed certificates in an intranet context. They don&#039;t issue certificates for IP addresses or intranet hosts (in fact the whole CA Forum is moving away from that practice). And even if you managed to retrieve and deploy such a certificate you&#039;d have to repeat the process every 90 days.</p>									</div>

					<p>For more or less internal-only hosts, the alternative DNS challenge (DNS-01) might work better than the default, although that would need quite some integration work as well (and an additional risk of keeping your domain credentials on the router).</p>									</div>

					<p>I was able to get Let&#039;s Encrypt to issue a certificate from OpenWRT CC 15.05 and then use it for an internal host with Luci over HTTPS.&nbsp; No guarantee this configuration will work for you or that it is secure.</p><p>Step 1<br />Create a free subdomain with DuckDNS.org.&nbsp; There are some other free subdomain providers, but they must be registered with the public suffix list to avoid quota limits on certificates with Let&#039;s Encrypt</p><p>Step 2<br />Configure the DDNS package to have Openwrt automatically update DuckDNS with your WAN IP address</p><p>Step 3<br />Install TLS to enable HTTPS on uhttpd<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>opkg update
opkg install uhttpd-mod-tls</code></pre></div><p>Step 4<br />Enable uhttpd to respond to requests to your duckdns.org subdomain from devices on your private LAN.&nbsp; This is required because uhttpd seems to reject by default any requests from a private LAN host to the wan address, which is what your duckdns subdomain resolves to.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>uci set uhttpd.main.rfc1918_filter=&#039;0&#039;

opkg install netcat</code></pre></div><p>Step 6<br />Download and install acme.sh shell script from Neilpang on GitHub.&nbsp; </p><p>Step 7<br />Edit this script to change the stand-alone webserver port to something other than 80 or 443 assuming you have uhttpd already running on those ports.&nbsp; Search for this line and change 80 to an open port number, such as 8080<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Le_HTTPPort=80</code></pre></div><p>Step 8<br />Enable port forwarding on port 80 on WAN to the stand-alone webserver port selected in Step 7<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># open port for HTTP validation
uci add firewall redirect
uci set firewall.@redirect[-1].target=DNAT

uci set firewall.@redirect[-1].dest_port=[THE PORT YOU CONFIGURED FOR THE SCRIPT, such as 8080]
uci commit

# restart firewall
/etc/init.d/firewall restart</code></pre></div><p>Step 9<br />Generate the certificate with Let&#039;s Encrypt using the shell script&#039;s stand-alone webserver for HTTP authentication<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>acme.sh --issue --standalone -d example.duckdns.org</code></pre></div><p>Step 10<br />Assuming step 9 worked, close port 80 from WAN access that was opened in step 8<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>uci delete firewall.@redirect[-1]
# restart firewall
/etc/init.d/firewall restart</code></pre></div><p>Step 11<br />Configure uhttpd to use the Let&#039;s encrypt certificate and key generated in step 9<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cd ~/acme.sh/
cd example.duckdns.org
cp example.duckdns.org.cer /etc/uhttpd.crt

/etc/init.d/uhttpd start</code></pre></div><p>Step 13<br />Assuming that all worked, try to navigate to your duckdns subdomain from a PC on your LAN with HTTPS.</p><p>Note that Let&#039;s Encrypt expire after 90 days, so you&#039;ll need to setup a cron job or something to renew it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>languagegame</strong> on 4 Jun 2016, 08:07)</p>

					<p>Hi languagegame,</p><p>thanks a lot for your description / introduction. Currently I&#039;m trying to get my OpenVPN work (with help from the forum). To prevent side-effects I would afterwards try to make Luci work with your howto.</p><p>Thanks a lot and kind regards,</p><p>Dirk</p>									</div>
