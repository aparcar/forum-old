					<p>I&#039;m trying to add a third SSID to my OpenWRT router which only connects users to an Openconnect VPN network.</p><p>The router has two existing SSIDs which connect to the LAN+internet on 2.4 and 5.0 GHz antenna arrays. I&#039;m able to connect directly to the VPN network via NetworkManager-openconnect on my Linux PC.</p><p>When connecting to my new SSID, I get an IP but no internet connection. I&#039;m also unsure whether the VPN connection is succeeding or not.</p><p>I followed the instructions at github.com/openwrt/packages/tree/master/net/openconnect as well as tried to understand what&#039;s going on in this question (superuser.com/questions/805833/vpn-on-ssid-2-openwrt) but with no success.</p><p>I&#039;d like to find a solution without having to install LuCi.</p><p>Below are the additions to the config files I made:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#/etc/config/network

					<p>Hi, I am trying exactly the same. Furthermore, I still would like to access to my &quot;normal&quot; lan clients.</p><p>I assuming you are not really connecting to your VPN. Check the SysLog, it should tell you. I was not able to connect to my VPN using the URL as the &quot;server&quot; option. But using the IP it worked. But this enforces you to provide the right server-hash. You can get the hash by opening the VPNs URL in your browser and check the certificate (in most browsers you can click on the small icon/lock next to the url to show the certificate). I was able to route all my traffic through the VPN using the following setup:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[b]/etc/config/network[/b]

        option password &#039;xxx&#039;

I would be thankful for every hint!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Protestallianz</strong> on 6 Mar 2017, 21:11)</p>
