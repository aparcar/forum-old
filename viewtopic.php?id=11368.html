					<p>I&#039;ve checked the latest revision of Kamikaze, 7730. When T try to load the kernel module speedtouch I get the following messages:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>speedtch: Unknown symbol usbatm_usb_disconnect
speedtch: Unknown symbol usbatm_usb_probe
usb 1-2: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 2

					<p>Hi,<br />I found this problem sometimes in 7.06 and I solved it just by deinstalling/reinstalling the speedtouch module. I think it happened to me because of I&#039;m playing around with other USB modem (ueagle type) because I need &quot;RFC 1483 Routed with Static IP&quot; to work and I don&#039;t know how with any of these two. Maybe you can help me....</p><p>Regards</p>									</div>

					<p>This doesn&#039;t sounds like a solution. Unfortunately I&#039;m not a kernel hacker, so I can&#039;t solve the problem myself. I just wait for a developer to step in and solve it. I knew the migration to 2.16.22 would take time, so I&#039;m going to complain about it. I just want to report bugs.</p><p>Thank you for your work!</p>									</div>
