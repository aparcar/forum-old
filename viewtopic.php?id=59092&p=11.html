Both have problems with WiFi transfer speed in both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. I have compared WiTi running original WiTi FW with MT drivers with and without HW NAT, OpenWrt CC and OpenWrt DD trunk with TP-Link N750 router running original proprietary FW and WiTi has significantly lower performance with any FW :-( In fact my results showed that the best performing WiTi FW was trunk but the differences are small. On top of that WiTi does not provide reliable performance all the time. There is big variation of WiFi transfer speed during the test and also the teste results vary a lot while TP-Link provides always the same and good performance.</p><p>BTW: For me the biggest issue of WiTi is SAMBA/NFT throughput on WiFi. While on cable connection I have roughly 28MB/s write speed, on 2.4GHz wifi it is only 800kB/s :-( I have tried both NFS and Samba. NFS is slightly better but still &lt; 1MB/s. I tried the same with TP-Link that has USB2 drive connected and I have ~2MB/s write speed. Considering that WiTi has fast SATA drive connected&nbsp; the results is very disapointing.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>KejPi</strong> on 8 Jan 2016, 16:54)</p>

					<p>@KejPi, have you installed heatsinks/radiators on the CPU and Wifi chips of the Witi yet? I believe nitroshift pointed out his experience was that things were very slow/inconsistent due to the thermnal protection features in both chips, and adding heatsinks (which funny enough were in the original Witi prototype but somehow got lost/dumped in actual production) seemed to make a big difference at least in terms of consistent performance. I have not tried yet, but the logic makes sense to me as I have not seen a wireless router without any kind of heatsink on it since the days of my good old 200Mhz WL-500gD!</p>									</div>

					<p>@jolouis: not yet, but radiators are already ordered. But I did another trial - I have decreased WiFi power to minimum (I have my PC less than 1 meter from the router so for the connection speed this should not be any problem) and I can confirm that the wifi performance is more stable ~28MB/s download in 2.4GHz band. So it looks like that proper cooling of WiFI chipset could stabilize WiFi although it looks like it is not helping for overall increase of maximum transfer rate.</p>									</div>
