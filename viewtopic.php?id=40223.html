					<p>Hey all! I&nbsp; came here to ask some questions about some network madness that started occuring when my provider started handing out gateway addresses outside of the standard subnet. I&#039;ve been having to manually assign a route to my gateway once I get&nbsp; my dhcp address like so </p><p>route add $defaultGW/32 eth1<br />route add default gw $defaultGW</p><p>and that seems to get things going. I was trying to find out where I would want to look at networking to change this (of if there was somewhere I could easily change the WAN subnet)?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>darthbator</strong> on 31 Oct 2012, 09:48)</p>

					<p>So I&#039;m actually still dealing with this particular issue. I checked out hotplug and it seems like basically exactly what I am looking for! The only issue is that I am currently getting the gateway IP address by looking at the stderr (I think, maybe it&#039;s even coming through stdout) of the init script that restarts networking. I would need to find a way to get that gateway IP address so I could pass it into the script I am using. Is that information easily exposed somewhere? The IP address I get as the gateway from the dhcp server?</p>									</div>
