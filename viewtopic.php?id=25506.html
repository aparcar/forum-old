					<p>I&#039;ve been playing around with the NAS potential of my little Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH router running OpenWRT. I did some thinking and searching about which filesystem to stick on my 1TB USB HDD. I decided to give XFS a shot after doing some reading about it.</p><p>Well it works ok until it for some reason unmounts improperly and hoses the filesystem log. It refuses to remount after that with strange client id errors in the sys log. We&#039;re not talking power loss here, but just unmounting going awry.</p><p>So don&#039;t use XFS. I just wanted to post and say that to hopefully save someone hours of wasted time. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>swaaye</strong> on 1 Jul 2010, 06:35)</p>

					<p>Did you do an unmount manually, or during reboot? <br />Did you notice any (usb) errors in the system log?<br />Maybe some file system drivers in backfire are not compiled correctly, another user had problems using ext2:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=25255">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=25255</a></p><p>I&#039;m using xfs a lot on ubuntu systems (server and desktop) and never had such problems with unmouning.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yup I did a umount manually.&nbsp; I don&#039;t remember seeing any USB errors. </p><p>I had rebooted the router a few times without issue. Maybe the manual umount is problematic but that&#039;s just a guess.</p><p>I&#039;m using ext4 now. Will just have to see how things go this way.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry for bumping up this old theme.</p><p>IMO, the reason for this error is that the embeddes systems do not have enough RAM to fsck big file systems (the mount of a xfs file system executes fsck too). So in this respect ext4 is not better than xfs, in fact it could be worst. In the case of xfs one is unable to mount the volume but there is no data loss. In the case of ext4 if one mounts a corrupted file system after a failing fsck, sooner or later the file system will be damaged irreparably.</p><p>So it seems the options are these:</p><p>1. Use several small â‰ˆ100GB volumes (provided we have available 100MB RAM) (impractical).<br />2. Modify the file system parameters. My guess is that if one uses 64KB block size this would permit using 400GB volumes (100GB times square root of 64KB/4KB, the last being the default block size). The problem: on Linux xfs doesn&#039;t support large block sizes...<br />3. Use VFAT. I haven&#039;t made any tests here either, but this file system is so simple that I suppose it shouldn&#039;t be a problem to fsck 1TB volume. The only big problem here is that VFAT doesn&#039;t support files greater than 4GB.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zinoviev</strong> on 26 Jul 2013, 21:27)</p>
