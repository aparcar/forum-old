					<p>Hello,</p><p>At present I am using OpenWrt &gt; Luci as the GUI. I have modified the theme to run with jquerymobile and CSS.</p><p>What I am now trying to work out is how do the scripts convert .Lua files to HTML files and output them in the browser. Currently it simply works, and my theme also works with it but i would really like to know how it is done.</p><p>I know where some of the files are and i can add things such as &quot;buttons&quot; lists, styles etc. However i would like to know how i can change the size of the buttons within a specific page. <br />Currently i set everything as global in the /themes/openwrt/header.htm file. And with other files which display everything using .htm files i simply add the CSS and jquerymobile styling to the .htm file which overrides the global settings and allows me to do specific styling to the page.</p><p>Here is a link to show you what i am looking at, (I am just a noob having a go and by no means do i understand even half of it). So any information would be great.</p><p><a href="http://whrl.pl/Rd56jH">http://whrl.pl/Rd56jH</a></p><p>For a look at how the theme looks so far go here (sorry about the low quality video):</p><p>skip ahead to 2:45 min if you want to get past our website:</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=716QNKbaR00">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=716QNKbaR00</a></p><p>This allows me to login and easily use the theme on smart phones and also tablets (cross platform).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Straitvodka</strong> on 29 Sep 2014, 13:36)</p>
