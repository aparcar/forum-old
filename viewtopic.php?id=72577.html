					<p>Hi there I was wondering if OpenWRT is compatible with the Actiontec GT784WN? If it is compatible with OpenWRT where can I download it? The only thing I could find was a syslog here on the OpenWRT Wiki &quot;wiki.openwrt.org/toh/actiontec/gt784wn&quot; If there is no download for GT784WN then will the OpenWRT Firmware for the Actiontec GT784WNV work? &quot;wiki.openwrt.org/toh/actiontec/gt784wnv&quot; I was also wondering if there is any other custom Firmware&#039;s besides OpenWRT for the GT784WN? I Totally Appreciate The Help Thanks! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /> - djcjf</p>									</div>

					<p>If the flash fails, recovery may be much more difficult than breaking it was if at all.&nbsp; It is possible the device will be permanently bricked.</p><p>If you choose to try it and understand the risk, the fimware can be found here:</p><p><a href="https://downloads.lede-project.org/snapshots/targets/brcm63xx/generic/">https://downloads.lede-project.org/snap â€¦ x/generic/</a></p><p>Especially if this device is your primary access to the Internet, I&#039;d advise caution and patience <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />&nbsp; Or maybe its just the excuse you need to get a new router LOL</p>									</div>
