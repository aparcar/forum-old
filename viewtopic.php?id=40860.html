					<p>I just bought a TP-Link WDR4300&nbsp; and tried to use it in bridge mode based on these two links:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient</a></p><br /><p>I connected my laptop directly to a LAN port of the router. I was hoping it could get an IP address in the range of the target router which was in the 10.80.X.X range, but i still got an address of 192.168.1.XXX. So i ran IPCONFIG /release on my laptop to see how it goes. Here is what happened next, i can not access the WEB interface of the WDR4300 anymore. Since it is in BRIDGE mode right now so i can not access from 2.4GHz because there is no SSID broadcast. I can not access from the LAN port either. I tried to push the RESET button on the back but it didn&#039;t help. Can anyone tell me how i can regain access to the web interface of the router? I am hoping the 5GHz band is still broadcasting but i am not sure since i have not found a device that supports 802.11a or n. Can anyone help me out here? Any advice will be appreciated. Thanks.</p>									</div>

When i keep clicking the WDS/RESET button for about one minute the SYS indicator did start to blink really fast. but still 192.168.1.1 is not pingable.

					<p>you did not said that the SYS led started blinking really fast before!</p><p>that&#039;s the &quot;feedback&quot; of the failsafe mode, so you are OK, no need to try other buttons -.-</p><p>did you set a static ip from your ethernet card settings?? for example 192.168.1.2</p><p>anyway it should not be necessary to click for a minute.. as wiki says, when SYS start blinking after poweron, click it! should be 5-10 seconds or so!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nebbia88</strong> on 2 Dec 2012, 00:20)</p>

					<p>Thanks. I tried several more times and finally was able to Telnet 192.168.1.1. I think the settings are:</p><p>ip address: 192.168.1.2<br />Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0<br />Default gateway: I just left blank ( i tried 192.168.1.1 but didn&#039;t work)</p><p>Even though i could access the router via Telnet i could not access the web GUI, so i ran a Reset and it became available. <br />So i figure that Telnet might work even though it shows no network connection at the left bottom corner of windows. </p><p>Thanks again for directing me to the right path. It saved me a great deal of time.</p>									</div>

My guess is that it was a trunk build and those do not include a web GUI by default. There are instructions in the wiki (see the Luci page) for installing it from the command line. Alternatively, flash to Barrier Breaker 14.07, which is a stable build that includes Luci pre-installed. It&#039;s very stable and works great.</p>									</div>

Maybe you should contact them? Alternatively, try installing luci as described in the wiki. Last option is to try reflashing via failsafe mode or TFTP/serial recovery.</p>									</div>
