					<p>I have a Linksys WGRT54GLv1.1 and I&#039;m running Kamikaze 7.09.<br />I&#039;ve done the SD card hardware mod and installed lighttpd to it.<br />I&#039;ve mounted the card at /mmc and all of lighttpd&#039;s binaries have been installed in their appropriate subdirectories (usr, lib, www, etc.) under /mmc.<br />I&#039;m now finding that lighttpd won&#039;t work unless I create the following soft links:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ln -s /mmc/usr/lib/lighttpd/mod_indexfile.so /usr/lib/lighttpd/mod_indexfile.so
ln -s /mmc/usr/lib/lighttpd/mod_dirlisting.so /usr/lib/lighttpd/mod_dirlisting.so
ln -s /mmc/usr/lib/lighttpd/mod_staticfile.so /usr/lib/lighttpd/mod_staticfile.so</code></pre></div><p>However, I eventually want to chroot &#039;jail&#039; lighttpd so I need it to run directly from the /mmc/usr/lib/lighttpd files and not rely on these soft links.<br />My knowledge of linux is not as good as I&#039;d like and I was hoping someone can tell me how I can get lighttpd to look for the /mmc/usr/lib/ files rather than look for the /usr/lib/ files.<br />Any advice you can give is appreciated.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Shagbag</strong> on 5 Apr 2008, 16:11)</p>
