					<p>I&#039;ll be traveling around South East Asia with a couple of friends for an entire year. Therefore, I believe it would be best for us to use a travel router when connected to the hotel wifi (or ethernet), an internet shop, a local coffee shop, etc. We&#039;ll be mostly browsing, watching movies &amp; shows, using cloud storage, plus the occasional download.</p><br /><p><strong>GOALS</strong><br />For me, the router/repeater features are more important than the media features. The goal is to create our own private, secure network that only our devices can be part of, while still having good internet access.</p><p>• Always have the same SSID and password no matter where we go or how we connect.<br />Internet1 Hotel Wifi (SSID1&amp;Pass1) &gt;&gt; Travel Router (<em>MySSID&amp;MyPass</em>) &gt;&gt; Our devices <br />Internet2 Coffee Wifi (SSID2&amp;Pass2) &gt;&gt; Travel Router (<em>MySSID&amp;MyPass</em>) &gt;&gt; Our devices <br />Internet3 Ethernet &gt;&gt; Travel Router (<em>MySSID&amp;MyPass</em>) &gt;&gt; Our devices<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; • Less wifi passwords being stored on our devices<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; • Less hassle having to setup Chromecast every time we are in a new place<br />• Keeping internet performance high would be a bonus, specially in 3rd world countries all over Southeast Asia.<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; • Hopefully, the router/repeater would help boost the signal and connection strength.<br />• The ability to hide our SSID would be a bonus.<br />• The ability to share media from the router would be a bonus, but not important.<br />• The ability to use VPN would be a bonus (and I definitely need/want to learn more about VPN)</p><br /><p><strong>RESEARCH</strong><br />I&#039;ve read some of the posts by RangerZ and others and it seems like the new GL-AR300M fits the bill. However, can I set it up where I can have our network have a hidden personalized SSID and password?</p><p>Here are the top device choices based on what I&#039;ve researched so far:<br />• <a href="http://www.gl-inet.com/ar300m/">GLI GL-AR300M</a> - hardware, firmware and GUI makes this one of the best travel routers in it&#039;s class<br />• <a href="http://www.kingston.com/us/wireless/wireless_readers/mlwg3">Kingston MLWG3</a> - good choice, however, the router side is minimal, the media side is feature-rich<br />• <a href="http://www.hootoo.com/hootoo-tripmate-nano-ht-tm02-wireless-portable-router.html">HooToo TM-02</a> - GUI is basic and unsure if my desired setup is plausible)<br />• <a href="http://www.hootoo.com/hootoo-tripmate-ht-tm06-wireless-router.html">HooToo TM-06</a> - upgraded core, but my concerns are the same as with the TM-02<br />• <a href="https://www.invizbox.com/">InvizBox Go</a> - new company, new device, VPN, although it has no ethernet port so no router?<br />• <a href="http://www.tp-link.com/en/products/details/TL-WR810N.html">TP-LINK TL-WR810N</a> - upgraded core, soon to have open firmware, has potential<br />• Any other device that fits the bill, insert here... (Coredy, RavPower, Comfast, etc)</p><br /><p><strong>QUESTIONS</strong><br />- So which device would be best for my goals?<br />- Would you recommend using VPN when travelling South East Asia?<br />- If you do recommend the GL-AR300M:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; • Should I get it with with two 2dbi external antennas or would the internal antennas be fine?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; • Will the lockout issue still be an issue (no pun intended <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />)? What approach would you recommend?</p><br /><p><strong>Thank you in advance for your time and suggestions...</strong></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jasamour</strong> on 17 Aug 2016, 03:18)</p>

					<p>Once you load OpenWrt on these they all have about the same functionality.&nbsp; The differences are CPU\ram\flash\micro-sd and battery.&nbsp; Switches mostly do not work as in stock.&nbsp; </p><p>I had an old linksys travel router.&nbsp; It had the fold out wall connection.&nbsp; Finding power is not always easy in coffee shops and airports.&nbsp; 5V is much better.&nbsp; You can connect it to a laptop or an external battery for power..</p><p>OpenWrt has no ability to store SSID info (delivered), not sure about other stock firmware.&nbsp; GLi makes this easy to manage with their GUI. You can hide an SSID in OpenWrt.&nbsp; Most, but not all devices can find hidden SSIDs.</p><p>The InvioBox is the only one that comes with VPN (and the service).&nbsp; You probably do not want to put OpenWrt on it (even if you can).&nbsp; Check if the service is supported where you are going.&nbsp; Your service generally needs to have servers in the country you are traveling in.</p><p>For VPN you should look at getting the most horsepower you can get to support encryption, but your gating factor is more likly to be the wireless connection speeds.&nbsp; Free is not usually fast.&nbsp; You need VPN to secure your internet traffic on public wifi.</p><p>I think antennas are a pain to travel with.&nbsp; If you break or loose one your in trouble, you can not just run with out them.&nbsp; You will generally be in line of site in most places other than a hotel room.&nbsp; </p><p>The GLi products are the only ones that come with OpenWrt installed.&nbsp; All the others have various levels of effort to set them up.&nbsp; You will need to add packages for USB, mini-DLNA and OpenVPN to meet the above requirements.&nbsp; The GLi will pretty much have all this.</p>									</div>

					<p><strong>RangerZ</strong><br />Thank you for your reply. I&#039;m very interested in the GL-AR300M because:</p><p>1 - It has the best hardware so far, so it has potential for upgrades (5G 802.11ac, Hi-Gain Antennas, PoE, etc)<br />2 - It comes with OpenWrt along with all of the other requirements installed (USB, DLNA, OpenVPN)<br />3 - Yes, 5V is definitely much better.<br />4 - I do not need to save the SSIDs&amp;PW of any locations, so we are good with that.</p><p>However,<br />• It&#039;s pricy and<br />• I&#039;m still unsure about the lockout issue. Would this still be an issue? What approach would you recommend to make my life easier?</p><p><em>THROWING AN $18 WRENCH</em><br />Xiaomi Mi WiFi Router Nano White - <a href="http://xiaomi-mi.com/mi-wifi/xiaomi-mi-wifi-router-nano-white/">http://xiaomi-mi.com/mi-wifi/xiaomi-mi- … ano-white/</a><br />I just ran into this little device that holds a lot of potential. Small, micro-USB, no DLNA though<br />• MT7620A<br />• 16MB Rom<br />• 64MB DDR2 RAM<br />• PCB antennas<br />• 1 WAN, 2xLAN ports (100mb only though).</p><p>Seems like a openwrt build is almost there. Let me know what you think. Thanks.</p><p><strong>stas2z</strong><br />Thanks. If I choose the Nexx WT3020F...<br />1 -&nbsp; what makes padavan&#039;s firmware so great?<br />2 -&nbsp; where can I get a reliable padavan&#039;s firmware?

					<p>Looked at the Xiaomi, but it&#039;s 12volts.&nbsp; Means you need AC.</p><p>I do not think the AR300M includes DLNA, not the same as file sharing, but not positive.&nbsp; Easy to fix, so not an issue.&nbsp; </p><p>Pricey?&nbsp; Your going to spend a year on the road and worried about spending $35 vs $20.&nbsp; The Kingston is closer to $70.&nbsp; VPN will cost you $7-10/month.&nbsp; The delta should be trivial, even to a bunch of poor college students.&nbsp; Your on the adventure of a lifetime.&nbsp; You will regret pinching pennies, and I&#039;m not just talking about the router.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Hopefully, the router/repeater would help boost the signal and connection strength</p></blockquote></div><p>A router will not &quot;boost&quot; a poor signal.&nbsp; It will help you maintain it (bridge) over distance, though more likely you will be close to the device, as opposed to the device being midway between you and the WISP, so it will really just share the connection.</p><p>The &quot;lockout&quot; issue is easy to fix with a script that disables the WWAN on boot or by a button action to do the same.&nbsp; All OpenWrt devices with a single radio will have this issue.&nbsp; Dev will not fix the connection issue.&nbsp; Advantage goes to GLi on this one.&nbsp; The GLi GUI features include a real easy to use tool that is mobile friendly.&nbsp; Luci is just to hard to use, and one can easily replace the AP when configuring the STAtion (WISP)</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you both for your input.</p><p>RangerZ<br />You are absolutely right. The money is not an issue at all.</p><p>I also appreciate that the GLi GUI is easy to use and mobile friendly.

The button solution works just fine... although this solution is something to look forward to.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jasamour</strong> on 18 Aug 2016, 11:28)</p>

					<p>You have the correct link.&nbsp; I do not have an AR300M, nor do I use this on my AR150, so I can not confirm it works.&nbsp; </p><p>I would change the times in the reset file from 2\5 to 5\15.&nbsp; This will make it easier to disable the WWAN, but more difficult to reset the device (and wipe the config).&nbsp; </p><p>WDS and relayd should not impact your use case.</p><p>What ever OpenWrt device you choose will have the same issue, however the solution relies on a working button, which not all devices have.&nbsp; You can place this in the startup for those that do not have a button, but this means that you will need to rest the WWAN after every reboot.&nbsp; May or may not be an issue in your case.</p>									</div>

					<p>Another solution to the &quot;lockout&quot; problem is to add a USB WiFi dongle to the USB port and configure it on the LAN. This way, you always have wireless access to the router regardless of whether it can connect to the WWAN.</p><p>stas2z,</p><p>Does the Padavan firmware support USB WiFi dongles in platforms with a USB port such as the NEXX?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>unmesh</strong> on 24 Aug 2016, 01:28)</p>

					<p>Interesting thread - didn&#039;t know that routers with all this preinstalled could be bought! If I buy this: GLI Mini Travel Router GL-AR300M with 2dbi external antenna, I could attach the GLI to my fiber box in my holiday house, and via configuring a VPN client, connect to my router at home? But how to bridge the wifi of the GLI to use the VPN? My ASUS router at home has a build-in VPN server (PPTP or OpenVPN). <br />Any advice on how to do this ?</p>									</div>
