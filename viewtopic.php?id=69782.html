					<p>Hi, I want to put a microphone in a Chaos Calmer 15.05 through a usb sound card, to be able to measure noise levels.<br />I was thinking of using the python package soundmeter.

But how do I do this? I have followed this guide with a ubuntu 14 wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build and have built the general openwrt package, but in the toolchain folder, there is no file called mips-openwrt-linux-uclibc-gcc.
