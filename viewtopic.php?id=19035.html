					<p>Working with Kamikaze 8.09 on an Asus WL500g Deluxe.&nbsp; This was from the downloaded binary .trx.&nbsp; I&#039;m having trouble getting pppd/pppoe to connect on boot, and to retain the proper mru and mtu.</p><p>I can manually do it with an ifup wan after it boots.&nbsp; I have also put that in a line in the /etc/init.d/network boot block, but that only works most of the time.&nbsp; Plus I&#039;m concerned that initiating the pppoe connection that way, the connection won&#039;t &#039;persist&#039; if it gets disconned some way.</p><p>First question I have is whether the process ignores what&#039;s in /etc/ppp/options (for example, the persist, mru and mtu settings)</p><p>root@42:/etc/config# cat /etc/ppp/options<br />#debug<br />logfile /dev/null<br />noaccomp<br />nopcomp<br />nocrtscts<br />lock<br />persist<br />mru 1468<br />mtu 1468<br />maxfail 0<br />lcp-echo-failure 5<br />lcp-echo-interval 1</p><br /><p>Thanks,</p>									</div>

					<p>If I&#039;m not mistaken, command line arguments will always override what&#039;s in /etc/ppp/options.&nbsp; I would recommend installing the &quot;procps&quot; package so you can see the full pppd command line with ps.&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying you&#039;re doing anything wrong but there is a default MTU in the pppd startup (/lib/network/pppoe.sh) that sets an MTU default as 1492.&nbsp; If you&#039;re setting that in /etc/ppp/options it <strong>will</strong> be ignored.&nbsp; The right place to set MTU is /etc/config/network in the &#039;interface&#039; &#039;wan&#039; section.</p><p>Regarding the option &quot;persist&quot;, I believe it&#039;s redundant in OpenWRT because the hotplug mechanism will restart the entire daemon if you loose the connection.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, I never was able to track down why pppoe isn&#039;t connecting (or why an ifconfig&nbsp; doesn&#039;t even show ppp0 even coming up) from the off-the-shelf binaries.&nbsp; I did come up with a workaround:</p><p>root@OpenWrt:~# cat /etc/init.d/ifup-wan <br />#!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common<br /># Copyright (C) 2006 OpenWrt.org </p><p>START=99<br />start() {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ifup wan&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />}<br />root@OpenWrt:~# /etc/init.d/ifup-wan enable</p><p>ppp0 now consistently comes up and connects on all three of my WL500gD &#039;s </p><p>from this, from the somewhat arbitrary nature of the problems, from some googling, and from some of my admittedly fumbling logger statements, I would guess there is a timing or coordination issue with pppd and/or /lib/network/ppp.sh.&nbsp; Maybe with hotplug events.</p><p>Nonetheless, the above workaround seems to have solved the issue for me for the time being; perhaps it&#039;ll help someone else.</p><p>Cheers</p>									</div>
