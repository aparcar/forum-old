					<p>What are opinions on what is the most hackable/moddable newer router? By newer I mean something with gigabit ethernet ports and at least wireless n, preferably dual band. I know the Linksys WRT54GL is probably the gold standard of hackable routers in terms of what has been done with it, but it&#039;s also getting to be pretty long in the tooth with limited RAM, Flash, and only 100 MB ethernet ports and a wireless G radio. It&#039;s not totally obsolete, but I&#039;m looking for something a little better, and I&#039;m wondering if there is any consensus on what is the most moddable nextgen router?</p>									</div>

It looks like ASUS may have designed this with the hacker/enthusiast market in mind, given the design. Maybe that&#039;s why it&#039;s the number two seller out of all routers on Amazon. With those kind of specs you could do an awful lot with it, both on the hardware and software side.</p><p>Note: It looks like there is also a newer model supporting the latest AC draft standards, although I prefer to wait until standards are finalized before buying hardware.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>AlgebraicMirror</strong> on 8 Oct 2013, 03:44)</p>

					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>as we talk about hardware hacking let me tell you we are now waiting for a new board that is currently in development phase and is called Cubiejet. As they had a road map where they already develop and sell the Cubieboard and soon the Cubietruck they will now develop the Cubiejet that will normally become a router / server on which OpenWRT will run.<br />If at least the same existing Cubietruck specifications will be respected I think this Cubiejet will become the board that everyone must have.</p><p>As the Cubieboard and Cubietruck already have GPIO I am sure that our router / server could become a real autonomous home / small enterprise router / server (file, printer, mail, web, home automation).<br /><a href="http://www.cubieboard.org">http://www.cubieboard.org</a></p><p>Have a nice day,</p><p>Miguipda ;-)</p>									</div>

This should have been fixed some months ago, but I didn&#039;t check that so far. Common workaround was using a usb 2.0 hub.<br />Also, the 32 MB RAM can be a serious limit these days. The last time I imported a MySQL-database, I had to add some swap space. Besides that, it works quite good.</p>									</div>
