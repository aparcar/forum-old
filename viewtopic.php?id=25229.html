The DockStar comes with 3 regular USB2 and 1 mini USB2 ports. I am sure you won&#039;t have any problem finding vendors selling many different 3G modems with a USB2 connector.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, the bifferboard looks very nice.&nbsp; I only wish it had a mini-pci slot so you could add a wifi card...&nbsp; I suppose you could add wifi via USB.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>LinkZ</strong> on 23 Jun 2010, 23:47)</p>
