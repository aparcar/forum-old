					<p>Disclaimer: This is NOT an OpenWRT issue but I would really appreciate any help.</p><p>I Have a wrt54G V1.0 that was bricked when doing a reset.</p><p>I successfully reflashed using the tutorial (method 2 Grounding pin 16) with the WRT54G_2.02.2_US_code.bin firmware using TFTP.</p><p>After that I upgraded to the latest linksys firmware 4.30.5 using the linksys upgrade utility.</p><p>All was well at this point. I powered off and restarted the router and it was working fine.</p><p>I should have left it alone BUT I thought I would try the DD-WRT V23 firmware and upgraded the firmware using the web interface. The flash seemed to go ok and I got a success message but after that the router would not work. On power on the power LED and DIAG led would stay on and there was no traffic on the LAN port.</p><p>I cursed myself and opened up the box again tried the pin 16 to ground mechanism again and reflashed the WRT54G_2.02.2_US_code.bin again using TFTP.</p><p>Again TFTP said it was ok and immediately after the flash the diag LED went off but no traffic on the LAN port. I powered off and on and again the diag LED stays on all the time with no traffic on the LAN port.</p><p>I have repeated the flashing procedure many times even using the Linksys firmware upgrade utility directly. The flash seems to go ok but the router on power reset hangs with the diag led on all the time.</p><br /><p>Looks like I did not follow the instructions of the DD-WRT install.</p><p>Apparently I was supposed to first install the minimal version and then upgrade to the standard version of DD-WRT .</p><p>On another forum a users says that not doing this could have caused the NVRAM to get corrupted.</p><p>My question is now that it is corrupt how can I recover the device.</p><p>I have already tried<br />1) &quot;Hard reset (holding reset button for 30 secs while plugging in the power). that does not help<br />2) Going back to an older version of the Linksys firmware (tried 1.02 and 2.02 and 4.30. The firmware installs successfully over TFTP but the router hangs with a permanently lit diag light and no traffic on the LAN ports.</p><br /><p>HELP!!!</p><br /><p>/sanjay</p>									</div>
