					<p>I&#039;d like to hear your thoughts on how to best setup my firewall.&nbsp; First off I am using the X-WRT image with VPN&nbsp; (Kamikaze version 8.09.2) which includes a firewall on my Asus WL520GU router.&nbsp; I have AT&amp;T DSL and so I get a dynamic IP address on my WAN.&nbsp; I have gone through the steps of using USB storage so space is not an issue.&nbsp; I have LOTS of room for packages.&nbsp; My goals are to be able to use Shorewall with both VPN and QOS functionality. I wanted to use the functionality in Shorewall to take care of QOS for me.&nbsp; I have been reading through the forums and have come across two different schools of thought on this subject-</p><p>#1 use both firewalls- the stock one as the first to come up and secure the perimeter and then startup Shorewall after everything is initialized. <br />OR<br />#2 Use only Shorewall- this would simplify administration but has a little added complexity in that the interfaces need to be ready so that Shorewall doesn&#039;t bomb out.&nbsp; (one poster warned of making sure everything was setup properly? or you might lock yourself out of the system unless you have a JTAG cable and can setup a proper connection using that method).</p><p>I have a slight preference for option #2 but am definitely interested in hearing your experiences for either.&nbsp; If I choose option #2 I understand that the basic process is to remove the S45 firewall script, turn off the firewall service and replace it with a startup script to run Shorewall.&nbsp; Any other things I should be aware of?&nbsp; Thanks for your input!</p>									</div>
