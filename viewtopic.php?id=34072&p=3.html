					<p>He Guys! Good News. </p><p>I debricked my router without JTAG or Serial or something.</p><p>My Symtoms: After power on the router, Power led was orange for about 5 seconds. Then nothing. No Pings no wlan, nothing.<br/>After a wireshark session and a little trial&amp;error i found following solution:</p><p>In the boot loader is a tftp client which requests a firmware.ram.</p><p>Following steps:</p><p>1. Build openwrt with ram image option (make menuconfig --&gt; Target Images --&gt; ramdisk). For everything else I just followed the guide on post #8. <br/>2. Set your local interface on ip 192.168.11.2 netmask 255.255.255.0 router 192.168.11.1<br/>3. setup a tftp-server. I used TftpServer Version 3.4.1 under osx mountain lion. <br/>4. rename the openwork-lantig-ar9-WBMR-uImage to firmware.ram<br/>5. start the tftp-server<br/>6. connect your pc to one lan port on the router.<br/>7. Power on the router + PRESS AND HOLD THE AOSS Button. If you dont push the button, there will be no tftp request.<br/>8. Now the Powerled should light up red + the AOSS led should light up.<br/>9. After a little while (tftp transfer to the router), change your local lan interface to automatic and you should get a ip-address from the dhcp server.<br/>10. Do a normal sysupgrade with a good image (e.g. AA 12).<br/>11. Wait and prey.</p><p>If you have running wireshark in the background, you will see if the tftp-transfer of the ram-image is successful.</p><p>Please confirm if it is working. And maybe we should then write in the wiki about the uboot-tftp-client.</p><p>have a nice debricking.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rossini</strong> on 20 Sep 2012, 16:19)</p>

I saw in wireshark that a lot of data was transmitted but after that I never get an ip address via dhcp neither did the router respond to ping 192.168.1.1. I took the uImage, which was generated together with my squashfs image. The image worked fine, until I installed 6in4 and rebooted. I will now try the uImage which comes with the openwrt 12.09 beta.</p><p>Some comments to step 7: It is not enough to wait until the AOSS/security led lights up. You have to press the button longer to trigger the tftp client. My first tries did not work because of this.</p>									</div>
