					<p>I use routers as a bridge very often, nebia is right, but it is usually handy to disable nat and dhcp too.

					<p>Ok thanks for your help but no luck so far.&nbsp; I looked at the dumbap recipe but I am not quite knowledgable enough to know which recipe applies to my hardware and how to apply it.&nbsp; I did find a recipe specific to my hardware at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/ubiquiti/routerstation.pro">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/ubiquiti/routerstation.pro</a>.&nbsp; I copied and pasted that recipe into my network config and rebooted but I do not get the wan port bridged to the rest of the ports.&nbsp; Could someone take a look at that recipe and provide me a little guidance with what I am doing wrong?&nbsp; Thanks for your time.<br />David</p>									</div>

					<p>You have openwrt, so the generic dumb ap recipe should work <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> At least it worked for me with different tplink and asus routers. I did not touch the switch section, it was not needed. Only what you will have to &quot;figure&quot; is the lan and wan port naming, but it seems to be eth0 and eth1, as nebia already told you. So your config should look like: (be sure to alter IP and gateway from your range, I prefer static ip, because then I know where to telnet to)</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface loopback
    option ifname    lo
    option proto    static
    option ipaddr    127.0.0.1
    option netmask    255.0.0.0

config interface lan
    option ifname    &#039;eth0 eth1&#039;
    option type    bridge
    option proto    static
    option ipaddr    192.168.1.1
    option netmask    255.255.255.0
    option gateway 192.168.1.254
    option dns 208.67.222.222

config interface wan
    option ifname    eth0
    option proto    dhcp

config switch
        option name     eth1
        option reset    1
        option enable_vlan 1

config switch_vlan
        option device   eth1
        option vlan     1
        option ports    &quot;0 1 2 3 4&quot;
