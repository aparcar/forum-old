					<p>Hi everyone, I am seeing some unexpected behavior on a network that I am trying to set up. I&#039;m hoping that the community might be able to help me out.</p><p>I have a Netgear R8000 with Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 installed. I have been given a block of 5 public IP addresses, and I would like to assign them to various computers which are plugged into the router. I have followed the instructions on this webpage:</p><p>matthewtckr.github.io/uverse/2015/06/23/uverse-static-ip.html</p><p>in order to assign the public IPs to the computers.</p><p>Doing a &quot;what&#039;s my ip&quot; check in a web browser on one of the computer seems to imply that from the outside, the computer does indeed have the public IP that I assigned to it. However, if I try to SSH remotely into the computer, the dropbear on the router seems to intercept the connection and responds instead!</p><p>I am forwarding port 22 in the firewall. I have also created traffic rules to both open port 22 (accept input) and a forwarding rule for port 22 (accept forward) in the &quot;Traffic Rules&quot; section, but no luck. For testing purposes, I have even temporarily &quot;disabled&quot; the firewall by setting everything in /etc/config/firewall to &quot;ACCEPT&quot;, but dropbear still seems to be intercepting all SSH connection attempts.</p><p>Am I missing some configuration step(s) somewhere?</p>									</div>
