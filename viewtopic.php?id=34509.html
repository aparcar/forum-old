					<p>I asked for and obtained a 1043 whitebox from SamKnows. It has arrived dead, no sys or qss led flashing, only lan switching is working.</p><p>I contacted community support and they told me that sh!t happens and they are sending me another unit (I can provide email ticket number if someones think I&#039;m faking).</p><p>I have tried to solder the serial connection to play a bit with the unit but even that doesn&#039;t work. The cable is ok, it works with other TTL connections. (P.S: I am not supposed to use +3V too, correct?)</p><p>Is there anything I could try or should I simply recycle it in the dust bin?</p>									</div>

					<p>I am trying to resolder the headers of the serial ports. The previous attempt was a &quot;surface&quot; mounting as the holes are smaller than the diameter of the headers I own and the pits are filled with soldering metal.
