					<p>Greetings:</p><p>I recently purchased a WNR854T at a great price--$20--and, well, as the old adage goes, you get what you pay for.&nbsp; I have not been pleased at how flaky the Netgear firmware has been so I decided to search for an alternative and found a discussion on experimental builds for the WNR854T here:</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=92403">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=92403</a></p><p>I realized that not everything was going to work, specifically the wireless--which I had turned off because it was too unstable--but things being as they were with the router I figured I did not have much to lose.</p><p>Anyway, I downloaded the webupgrade version of the firmware, installed it via the router&#039;s web interface, and voila!&nbsp; I had OpenWrt running!</p><p>The first thing I did was install Webif2--I like things GUI--and then I set about customizing the settings:&nbsp; changing the router (LAN) IP address (10.1.1.1), setting up DHCP reservations for my various components, forwarding ports, setting up DynDNS, etc.&nbsp; Everything is working great in that regard, so well done devs!</p><p>That said, I have come across three problems that, due to my lack of network experience, I am having trouble resolve, so I was wondering if some kind soul could assist.</p><p>First, in terms of connections, it goes Internet --&gt; Cable Modem --&gt; WRT854T.&nbsp; From there, I have my server (Ubuntu), my WAP (Aironet 1231G I got cheap from a liquidation sale, thus the seeming mismatch of quality versus the router) and my XBMC PC connect to the router itself.&nbsp; Again, everything seems to be working fine--port forwarding, DynDNS, DHCP, web, etc.), but:</p><p>1.)&nbsp; I cannot access the Web Management for the WAP from my server through the router, nor can I ping it.&nbsp; Both seem to be working fine and both show up as DHCP clients.&nbsp; Also, my wireless devices all connect through OK and can access the web.&nbsp; I suspect this is just a network tweak I need to do, but again, I am not well versed on the networking side, so I am not sure how to tackle it.</p><p>2.)&nbsp; As I already indicated, my devices cannot ping each other.&nbsp; I cannot ping my XBMC PC from my server and vice versa.&nbsp; Also, the wireless devices cannot ping the server.</p><p>3.)&nbsp; Finally, and also likely related, I cannot access SMB shares on my server from any of my other computers.&nbsp; It does not matter if a device is connected to the router or via the WAP, I cannot get to my server.</p><p>Again, I suspect this is just a noob quandary, but&nbsp; appreciate any insight.&nbsp; I could not find answers in the forums, but probable was not search for the right terminology.&nbsp; Let me know if any more information is needed--output from logs, commands, etc.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Figured out the problem:&nbsp; the firewall.&nbsp; I had to add a rule to allow the LAN traffic to go through the firewall; thus, in Webif2, under Network -&gt; Firewall:</p><p>&quot;Allow traffic originating from &lt;lan&gt; to &lt;lan&gt;Fix MTU (unchecked)&quot;</p>									</div>
