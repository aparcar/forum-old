					<p>All,</p><p>I had been using AA release for a long time. One thing I had working was that I could add a port redirect for port 443, and then SSL into my router from any internet.</p><p>Using BB release now, a port forward does not work. It appears I need a traffic rule instead? I&#039;m trying to figure out if this is an issue, what the difference is, and why I can&#039;t just use a port forward to my router IP as I used to do in AA.</p><p>Any ideas or help is greatly appreciated.</p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>
