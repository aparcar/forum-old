					<p>Hi<br />When i start Kismet it finds only my own wireless network (another router sitting 2m away) and my notebook&#039;s wireless card. <br />But when I run netstumbler from my notebook (intel pro wireless 2200BG) it finds about 9 different wireless networks. <br />I suppose that WRT54G have to be more sensitive then intel 2200BG. <br />Also wl scan , wl scanresults gives me only my own wireless network<br />i have the following wl parameters:<br />ap 0<br />monitor 1<br />promisc 1<br />wrt is connected to another router through wlan with static ip <br />OpenWrt ver. is RC3<br />Am i doing something wrong (misconfiguration?) or it is sensitivty what 54G have with its antennas (i doubt that)?</p><p>And another question is how do i find how much RAM my box have, is there utility that shows configuration? (WRT54G V4)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>DigitalGhost</strong> on 29 Oct 2005, 04:03)</p>
