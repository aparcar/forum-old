					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>I am not using Open WRT on a router but rather a fiber optics media processor board that uses OPEN WRT for switching. I was able to log into the GUI before using the correct IP address, but messing with the settings, I remember going to LAN options and changing it to BR-LAN. Now I can&#039;t get into the web gui anymore. Talking to a tech support at the company who makes this board, he showed me how to login into OPEN-WRT using putty. I am now confused. I am in the directory /etc/config and do not know how to change back to LAN mode instead of BR-LAN mode. Here is a screenshot of where I am stuck. I am not familiar with opening files in linux but it seems like I need to open the network file to change the setting.</p><br /><p>root@OpenWrt:/etc/config# ls<br />dhcp&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;luci_statistics&nbsp; openvpn_recipes&nbsp; tivideo<br />dropbear&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;network&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; qos&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ucitrack<br />firewall&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ntpclient&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; samba&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; uhttpd<br />luci&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;openvpn&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; system&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;wireless<br />root@OpenWrt:/etc/config#</p><p>When I do cd network, I get an error. I don&#039;t believe it&#039;s a directory. Any help would be appreciated so I can log into the GUI again.</p>									</div>
