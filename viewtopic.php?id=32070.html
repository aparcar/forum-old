					<p>What happens when an openwrt router with factory defaults (ie lan network is 192.168.1.0/24) has its wan plugged to another router that is also using 192.168.1.0/24 for its lan? I am testing an openwrt router plugged to my adsl router that also uses 192.168.1.0/24 for its lan. The openwrt router then has an ip address from the range 192.168.1.0/24 assigned to its wan port through dhcp. It seems to me that this would cause some kind of routing conflict unless the firewall/nat logic isolates this by routing to interface names.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Perazim</p>									</div>
