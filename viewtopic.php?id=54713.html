					<p>So, yesterday I installed, well, upgraded from my old Backfire to Barrier Breaker on my:<br />System<br />bcm63xx/96358VW (0x6358/0x00A1) Processor<br />Broadcom BCM6358 V1.0</p><p>It all went well. And I decided to change the IP, after installing, mistakenly, icecast, which installed without an issue.</p><p>Anyway, since trying to change the IP, I can&#039;t now log into the box. If plugged to another router, it will accept an ip from that router. But using that router&#039;s IP, I still can&#039;t log into this router. </p><p>I&#039;ve tried all the tricks known to me. I simply need to get into this box, give it an IP and configure it. </p><p>Any help would be appreciated. I can even be a test-bed for this router, as the wiki says Barrier Breaker was installed but not tested. So far, before the break, it worked well. </p><p>And I must add, when plugged directly into a computer, it gives a local IP: 169.254.122.227. I can connect to the wifi, but that too gives a local ip: 169.254.86.201</p><p>I manually changed the IP on my machine and could ping the address that I changed it to. </p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>noneofmyseeds</strong> on 23 Dec 2014, 23:13)</p>
