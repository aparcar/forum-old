					<p>We bought a few buffalo WHR-HP-G54 APs, and have been looking into the design of a good infrastructure. current setup is 3 dsl connections, 3 linksys brand APs behind a DSL modem, the primary AP connected to the DSL serves dhcp to the clients, 2 APs are extending the wireless signal so we are currently running wds mode amongst the 3 aps, on each of the 3 DSL lines in different locations. we had been using the services of an external provider but are outgrowing this method. so we setup freeradius with mysql in our office so we could authenticate the three remote wds networks to one place, we then researched chill, coova, wifidog. During the research we have seen posts about wds and chilli not being compatible, though coova, which is a chilli fork claims wds and coova works. can someone states whats reality? does or does not chilli work with wds? or is there a better method for this distributed design to authenticate our clients, this is the last piece to put in place, authentication before we drop our other service</p>									</div>
