					<p>Turns out I had the wrong version of Backfire 10.03.1 in the router.&nbsp; That the kernel version was something other than 2.6.32.27 and thus opkg didn&#039;t have some of the packages I needed for the USB mod.&nbsp; I then SSH&#039;ed into the router so I could do</p><p>cd /tmp/<br />wget <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/brcm47xx/openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 â€¦ uashfs.trx</a><br />mtd write /tmp/openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx linux &amp;&amp; reboot </p><p>And then I had the correct version.&nbsp; </p><p>Went back into the web GUI of Backfire, and did an &quot;update lists&quot;.&nbsp; Once I had the items installed, a couple of iterations of fooling around with the &quot;mount points&quot; I was able to see the files on the USB sticks I plugged into the router.&nbsp; I had a couple more WRT54Gv2&#039;s which I did the mods on, and got them to work.&nbsp; <br />(hey, I&#039;m a hardware guy, not software)...</p><p>See <a href="http://www.wa2ise.com/radios/WRT54Gv2USBmod.html">http://www.wa2ise.com/radios/WRT54Gv2USBmod.html</a> for more details.</p><p>For grins, I used a USB hub connect to the router&#039;s new USB jack to see if I could have two USB sticks connected.&nbsp; At least the particular hub I used, it worked.&nbsp; The first USB stick was &quot;sda1&quot; and the 2nd was &quot;sdb1&quot;.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wa2ise</strong> on 16 Nov 2017, 06:37)</p>
