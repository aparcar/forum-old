					<p>Hi!<br />I&#039;ve installed OpenWRT Backfire on my Linksys router. My question is how can I get internet on it from another router (which handles the internet connection at home).<br />I&#039;m a beginner so I don&#039;t know if there is already a topic with this theme.<br />Thank you for your help.</p>									</div>

					<p>point it at the other router for gateway.</p><p>cable into a lan port rather than wan port.</p><p>decide how you want your subnet numbering to work and set up as appropriate.</p><p>If you are going to use your isp for dns then I assume your old router is picking up dns as part of dhcp from the net.&nbsp; &nbsp;Point the backfire at the old router for these services.</p><p>I&#039;d run the ne router on a static IP although some might set a reserved address in the old dhcp range.</p>									</div>
