					<p>Hey guys,<br />I am new to open source routing and linux in general. I have a script which runs a binary that requires 2 ethernet interfaces eth0 and eth1. Where eth1 is for a wan connection and eth0 is for a lan connection.<br />I am currently using an airlink 101 ar335 which I don&#039;t believe has an eth1 card (if someone can correct me please do)</p><p>What I tried to do was to create a virtual lan by modifying the /etc/config/network file by adding:<br />config switch eth0<br />option vlan0 &quot;0 1 2 3 5*&quot;<br />option vlan1 &quot;4 5&quot;</p><p>and modifying eth0 to be eth0.0 below</p><p>config interface lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp;eth0.0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option type&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;interface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; static<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr&nbsp; &nbsp;192.168.77.111<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask&nbsp; 255.255.255.0</p><br /><p>then creating vconfig eth0.1 and eth0.0, bridging them, trying to associate eth0.0 as eth0 and eth0.1 as eth1. I ran into 3 problems:<br />1) I lost routing to the internet when I created the virtual lans. My router can ping hosts over the internet but my pc connected directly via lan port could not access the internet.<br />2) I did not assign eth0.1/eth0.0 to a specific port (I do not know how) so eth0.1 was not transmitting any packets<br />3) When I pulled the plug off my router I couldn&#039;t access it an IP address so I had to reboot.</p><p>I know this is a lot of questions into a single question but if there is an alternate way to separate eth0/eth1 for lan/wan rather than a vlan suggestions are welcome.<br />Also if I am doing something wrong when setting up a vlan when vlans indeed should meet my needs again point me in the right direction.</p><p>Thank you for your help<br />Hamid</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for your help, however I am still running into problems<br />I ran the ./user-switch command without inputting any parameters so as to see the virtual lans available and I see that vlan1 has &quot;0 1 2 3 5&quot; and vlan2 has &quot;4 5&quot; assigned. Does that mean that if I create a vlan using vconfig and name them eth0.1 eth0.2 that I will be using vlan1 and vlan2 respectively?? It seems that this is not the case as no packets are being sent to or received on either interface when my script is running. Is there some way to assign the virtual lan to an interface, or am I doing something wrong?</p><p>Thank you<br />Hamid</p>									</div>

					<p>Two things:<br />When setting up the switch parameters, the name here must match exactly the directory in /proc/switch.<br />So you must use &quot;0&quot; instead of &quot;eth0&quot; or else you won&#039;t actually change the switch parameters.</p><p>uci set network.0=switch&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />uci set network.0.vlan1=&quot;0 1 2 3 5*&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />uci set network.0.vlan2=&quot;4 5&quot;</p><p>In addition, the reason it still seems to be working is that eth0 still has an IP address set, and still on the same subnet as eth0.1 (so your router is still happily responding on eth0 because it is on the same subnet).</p><p>So you may need to do &quot;ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0&quot; which in the linux ifconfig tells it to remove the IP address from eth0 (you don&#039;t want to ifconfig eth0 down because that will down the whole network including all vlans, you just want to make sure it only responds to the vlan, not to the global one)</p><p>#!/bin/sh<br />vconfig add eth0 1<br />vconfig add eth0 2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>uci set network.0=switch&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />uci set network.0.vlan1=&quot;0 1 2 3 5*&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />uci set network.0.vlan2=&quot;4 5&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>uci set network.wan=interface&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />uci set network.wan.ifname=eth0.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />uci set network.wan.proto=static&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />uci set network.wan.type=interface&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />uci set network.wan.ipaddr=192.168.82.3<br />uci set network.wan.netmask=255.255.255.0</p><p>uci set network.lan=interface&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />uci set network.lan.ifname=eth0.2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />uci set network.lan.type=interface&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />uci set network.lan.proto=static<br />uci set network.lan.ipaddr=192.168.82.5<br />uci set network.lan.netmask=255.255.255.0</p><p>ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0<br />/etc/init.d/network restart</p><p>Can you give that script a try?</p>									</div>

					<p>Well that cause complete connection loss to the router as the communication is solely through eth0. However I did notice 2 things:<br />1) With wireshark active it seems that the router is sending ARP requests to my pc which is responding with the correct mac address. However, the router still does not recognize this and keeps on sending more arp requests. Maybe there is something wrong with the arp table?</p><p>2) From your site:<br />* 990-phyfix.patch</p><p>You may place this patch in target/linux/atheros/patches-2.6.26/ under the Kamikaze root and it should get applied automatically--but make sure to check the drivers/net/phy/phy.c file to make sure it actually got changed to save yourself some frustration. </p><p>When I went to basedir /target/linux/atheros/files/drivers/net/ there is only the ar2313 folder. The phy folder that you mentioned is not available could this be the cause of the problem.</p><p>Thank you <br />Hamid</p>									</div>
