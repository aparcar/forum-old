					<p>The package is currently at a state where I can release an alpha build, the driver requires heavy configuration to get it working currently so don&#039;t expect it to be easy to setup. You must manually set the country in the config file as well as setup the rest of the options. The firewall rules need to be setup as well after the driver is installed, as well as the dchp server.</p><p>Screenshots:<br />imgur dot com slash a slash PYRvM</p><p>WARNING: This is a pre-release version of the driver, I am not responsible for anything bad happening if you use it, It is largely untested proceed at your own risk. Source for the driver scripts will be released when the driver is more stable, if you want the source of the binaries please check the Quantenna code in netgear&#039;s firmware source files for the Netgear Nighthawk X4 R7500.</p><p>If you want to build it yourself here are the files:<br />github dot com /ILOVEPIE/qts1kpcie_wifi_driver</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ILOVEPIE</strong> on 24 Jan 2017, 00:23)</p>
