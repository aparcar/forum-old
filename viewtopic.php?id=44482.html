					<p>This maybe something basic but I was unable to find a solution. I&#039;ve created two VLANs, and I would like Windows PC on either side to be able to broadcast &#039;samba&#039; traffic so they can see each other&#039;s shared drives and printer. Is there a way to allow broadcast to go across different VLANs with different subnets?</p><p>Both VLANs are labelled as &quot;lan&quot; and &quot;dmz&quot; and they are grouped into the same lan zone in the firewall configuration. Is there anything that I can tweak on the firewall to make OpenWRT forward broadcast traffic across both subnets on both VLANs?</p><br /><p>/etc/config/network:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;loopback&#039;

					<p>The whole idea of vlan&#039;s is create different broadcast domains. The only way to link two vlan&#039;s on layer-2 is to create a bridge interface, but you would be better of with creating just one vlan.</p><p>Even if you were to connect those vlan&#039;s together with a software bridge, it still won&#039;t work as the servers have different ip adres ranges configured. You would also need to have the servers in the same subnet.</p><p>I suggest you find another sollution and not link the two vlan&#039;s on layer-2, but find a sollution on your windows boxes. This is very common in other networks (where servers are in another vlan than the clients).</p>									</div>
