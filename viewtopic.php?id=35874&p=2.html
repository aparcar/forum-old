					<p>This is TP-Link wireless configuration:</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://fenski.pl/router.jpg" alt="http://fenski.pl/router.jpg" /></span></p><p>And about OpenWRT it is Linksys WRT 160NL and I guess that after several reflashing it from scratch we can assume that it is with original config from Backfire <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />Now all I want to achieve is linking this WRT-160NL with TP-Link in WDS mode and then be able to connect with WRT-160NL from both wired and wireless clients. In addition OpenWRT itself should also contain internet access.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, I&#039;m thinking it should definately work.</p><p>So for the WRT-160NL starting at defaults you change your computer&#039;s IP to 192.168.1.x (i.e. something not in use 192.168.1.3), netmask 255.255.255.0, gateway 192.168.1.1 and dns 192.168.1.1.</p><p>Configure the LAN interface to use a static IP of 192.168.1.2 (TP-Link has 192.168.1.1?), gateway and DNS of 192.168.1.1.<br />Configure and enable the Wifi as you have on the TP-Link and use the Access Point (WDS) mode.<br />Disable dnsmasq and firewall via System -&gt; Startup in LuCI.<br />That is all there is to it.</p><p>But I&#039;m thinking if it doesn&#039;t work it could be because you need to enable encryption and I suggest you configure it to WPA2-CCMP (AES) on the TP-Link and the same on the OpenWRT router to test this theory.</p><p>If it still doesn&#039;t work try rebooting both routers and testing again.</p><p>EDIT: Actually probably best to try just with WPA-CCMP (AES) as I remember I had problems with WPA2 with backfire and TP-Link stock firmware but it was fine with trunk.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>j8soot</strong> on 4 Apr 2012, 16:21)</p>

					<p>Ok I&#039;ll try it today. TP-Link has 192.168.0.1 address so I&#039;m gonna use 192.168.0.3 or other not in use.</p><p>I can start with trunk version (I read somewhere that it&#039;s more stable) but then I&#039;m not sure how to create working configuration (all that bridging stuff).</p>									</div>

					<p>Assuming I&#039;ll reconfigure TP-Link to have 192.168.1.1 address are you able to provide me needed changes for freshly flashed OpenWRT trunk (so without LuCI) to have working WDS mode and internet for wired and wireless devices?</p><p>I mean the simplest configuration.

					<p>I am still learning like you but maybe someone else could do it. So far I only know a little about configs and I don&#039;t have a WRT-160NL.</p><p>But I think with LuCI you can do it easily as I said above but maybe it needs the encryption for WDS to work.</p>									</div>
