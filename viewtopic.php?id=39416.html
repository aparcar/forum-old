					<p>Well you were right, </p><p>I went to Failsafe mode:<br />&quot;Power up your router. When the &#039;SYS&#039; light starts to blink you have about 1 seconds to press the WPS/Reset button on the back-left of the router and hold it until the blinking gets faster.&quot;</p><p>Then i was able to get into the router by telnet with putty, and write &quot;firstboot&quot; to reset all settings to default.</p><p>From there i upgraded the OpenWrt and install the LuCi gui.</p><p>Thanks a lot, </p><p>Lior.</p><p>a little question: i have 2 computers connected from the router, one is connected Gigabit speed, and the other 100Mb.<br />How can i know that the 100Mb connection comes from slow on board lan device ? <br />how can i check my on-board lan speed, or see the auto-negotiation between the router to the lan-card.</p><p>Thanks again.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lamihai</strong> on 19 Sep 2012, 00:56)</p>

					<p>Friends, I bought WDR4310 unaware that the firmware was in Chinese. I tried to update the firmware WDR4300 and have not had success, now I can not access the router. I&#039;ve tried resetting all ways including pressing the reset button for 10 seconds and pressing the reset button so that the &quot;starlet&quot; start flashing. Could anyone help me please?<br />My skype is guilherme.marinn<br />Facebook <a href="http://www.facebook.com/guilherme.marinn">http://www.facebook.com/guilherme.marinn</a><br />thank you!</p>									</div>
