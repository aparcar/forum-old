					<p>Try this:<br />0) Connect through intermediate switch.&nbsp; Set PC to static IP address in 192.168.1.x range.<br />This is to ENSURE that PC always shows link up instead of waiting for it to notice the<br />router is powered up and making LAN available, which can take too long especially if<br />boot_wait was not set.<br />1) Power up<br />2) Quickly send a TFTP upload attempt</p><p>This may take a number of tries but eventually you will hit the timing where<br />boot-loader stops to accept a TFTP upload.</p><p>I find it MUCH simple to connect a serial console.&nbsp; From the console it takes<br />10 seconds to put the router in upload mode and fix it.</p>									</div>
