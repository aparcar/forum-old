					<p>HI everyone, </p><p>I&#039;ve just tried flashing Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 to my new TP-Link Archer C7 without properly reading the webpage, and it appears that I&#039;ve got one of the new flash chips which isn&#039;t supported until the trunk version. </p><p>Right now, my router boots up, but when I go to the webpage, it tries to load Luci and fails. (It flashes momentarily on the black screen and then on the redirect fails to load the page). Also, the only LED that lights up is the power LED. </p><p>I downloaded Putty and tried to SSH to the device, but SSH doesn&#039;t appear to be responding at all.</p><p>Do I need to flash the trunk version to fix this problem? If so, how do I go about doing this without Luci? Is there a factory reset that I can use somehow? </p><p>Sorry for the very basic questions. I appreciate any help that anyone can provide. </p><p>dave</p>									</div>

					<p>That did it - thank you! That was really helpful, Villeneuve.</p><p>As an FYI for everyone who might have the same problem, it wanted to download the v2 filename, not the v3 filename (there&#039;s some ambiguity in the text). My serial number begins with 2165.</p>									</div>
