					<p>Thanks for the reply! Is there a way/patch to workaround this? The above method (echo 0 &gt;...) worked well on earlier versions of this router, which gives me some hope... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Two years ago OpenWRT worked well on this device, except powering USB port. However in <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/37878">changeset 37878</a> they fixed it (see more <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/13201">here</a>). Now I can not power it off. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> Is that possible at all, or MUST one decide at kernel compile time whether to power the USB port or not?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, like you are saying, decide at compile time.&nbsp; The new version is compiled to take control of pin 4 and force it on so that USB always works right away.&nbsp; If you want the old way you would have to take that out of the kernel, which I think is just a line in the dts file for the model.</p><p>There may be another interface similar to how the buttons and LEDs work.&nbsp; But it isn&#039;t a general gpio like where you were looking.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 23 Mar 2015, 17:34)</p>

					<p>It should also be noted that if your 3G modem keeps crashing, it could be a lack of sufficient DC power from the router.&nbsp; The radio transmitter in those modems can draw a heavy pulsed current that is close to or over the 500 mA maximum, which is hard on the host&#039;s USB power supply.</p>									</div>
