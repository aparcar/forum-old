					<p>I had setup newest trunk on a Netgear WNDR3800, and after configuring OpenVPN I noticed it get&#039;s stuck at 100% after some time. <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/7159">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/7159</a> suggested it&#039;s because of a mismatching kmod-tun. How can I fix this and why is it mismatched when trunk packages were build against the same kernel sources like the trunk image itself? If it&#039;s not easy to fix, how can I flash the router back to a stable release?</p><p>I noticed it just happens when I download, or actually, start a download, or even trigger a download. For example I open a &quot;save to&quot; dialog to download a 100mb test file, and the openvpn client will go up to 98% cpu load, even there is no download happening at that moment (again, Im just in the save to dialoge). It doesnt matter anymore by then at that point if I start the download, or cancle it. Openvpn will stay for a few minutes at that high cpu load, and then will go down to zero again, until I repeat the step. Normal surfing, even with high data load doesnt trigger that behavior, other high load like youtube doesnt do it too.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>knuddel</strong> on 6 Mar 2013, 11:42)</p>

					<p>you can fix (or avoid) mismatches of packages/kernelmodules in trunk by updating to the most recent image before installing additional packages. The precompiled packages of trunk are just snapshots, so a new version is compiled every now and then.<br />So if you have an old firmware-image installed and try to install an new kernelmodules you will get problems. </p><p>to your vpn-question: <br />most browser start the download instantly even before you have selected a destination in the safe dialog. So it sounds like you only get high cpu-utilization when you actually download something. <br />There is no hardware-crypto-acceleration so encryption/decryption is done by the CPU, and your CPU can&#039;t handle more than&nbsp; 20-25Mbit/s (AES-256), and this would produce high cpu-utilization.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 6 Mar 2013, 20:12)</p>

					<p>Hello eleon216, thank you for your answer. I had used the trunk generic base image of the same build date as the packages (05-Mar-2013 for kernel 3.8.2) so I dont think it can be because of a mismatched module.</p><p>And I know what you mean, but that&#039;s not the case here. I bought the WNDR3800 because I thought it would be able to handle higher AES-256 encryption bandwidth, which is not the case so far. OpenVPN just uses up to 100% for just like 600kbit/s, and I dont get any more bandwidth because of the CPU limit, which is another problem right now, but not the one because I started this thread.</p><p>But youre right, I put a 2nd shh window beside htop to look at the bandwidth with iftop, and the 100% cpu is caused by bandwidth. However I don&#039;t download the test file, I just trigger the download and imidialy cancle it. It seems the VPN server &quot;sends&quot; me the whole file, even if I cancled the download, how can that be? And to come up with the 100% problem itself, why is a 600kbit/s download triggering 100% CPU, should the Atheros AR7161 rev 2 not be able to handle like 20-25Mbit/s like you said? Because that was the main reason I bought this router, because I had already max CPU load and bad down speeds via OpenVPN with my old router, a TpLink WR1043ND, and I thought the AR7161 would be much faster than the Atheros AR9132.</p><p>Any hint on why the VPN server seems to &quot;flood&quot; me the whole download even if I cancle it, and why OpenVPN uses max CPU load for a bandwidth of around 600kbit/s? Thanks again for your time answering me.</p>									</div>

					<p>the revision of your packages should be fine. <br />And I don&#039;t think this download behaviour is openvpn related, and I&#039;m really not interested in debugging your browsers download-behaviour, just use wget or curl for testing. </p><p>I&#039;m running openvpn on a WNDR-3700 v1 and I just tested it, I get 2MByte/s with cipher BF-CBC and 1,85MBytes/s with AES-256-CBC. So ok, I was wrong it&#039;s not 20-25Mbit/s (it think you can expect this rate running IPsec) but it&#039;s 15MBit/s with openvpn which is still 25 times faster than what you are getting. <br />So there is something wrong with your setup. </p><p>I have the following versions: <br />Openwrt: AA (r32719)<br />Kernel: 3.3.8<br />OpenVPN 2.2.2 mips-openwrt-linux [SSL] [LZO2] [EPOLL] built on Jul 15 2012 <br />and I&#039;m running openvpn in routing-mode (tun)</p><p>maybe you should try AA_rc1 instead of trunk just to be sure that there is no problem with the new kernel, or openvpn package. Or is there a special reason for using trunk?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 7 Mar 2013, 12:17)</p>

					<p>I have recorded a video showing the behavior: <a href="https://mega.co.nz/#!HIEziJpJ!bg8GLheUtPwaM_EFoegcmHqSYMRE5CvfGyy1v_gs3Hg">https://mega.co.nz/#!HIEziJpJ!bg8GLheUt â€¦ yy1v_gs3Hg</a></p><p>You can see in it, that the download keeps coming from the VPN server, even I have not started it, and I have cancled it in between. Also, you can see my routers OpenVPN CPU usage of about 63% for a max of ~7Mbit/s. What&#039;s your routers CPU usage for OpenVPN of your speed of 1,85MBytes/s with AES-256-CBC?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>knuddel</strong> on 7 Mar 2013, 12:44)</p>

					<p>The 1,85 MBytes/sec are not limited by the network-connection, they are limited by the CPU of the router so openvpn uses all CPU-time that is left (more than 90%).<br />And please just use wget to test it.</p>									</div>

					<p>ok I just checked your video. <br />iftop eats 30-40% of your CPU-time. <br />try a download without htop, iftop,...</p><p>and you use pppoe (on the router), and if I&#039;m not wrong it encrypts the data, so this will eat up CPU-time too. <br />run a download test without vpn and check the CPU-utilisation. <br />And use an ethernet-cable, and wget. Otherwise it&#039;s really difficult to make anything out of your numbers.</p><p>... and disable lzo-compression or stuff like that if you really want to know the bandwith.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 7 Mar 2013, 13:34)</p>
