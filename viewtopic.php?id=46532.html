					<p>Hi, </p><p>couple of weeks ago, trying to roll back to default firmware on my OpenWRT installation I bricked my TL-WR841N v8.2 router. I don&#039;t know what I did wrong, but after unsuccessfull use of mtd I couldn&#039;t do anything (any command would fail with an &quot;memory error&quot;).<br />After some searching I decided to try out serial recovery, using this article as a guide:</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=33906">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=33906</a></p><p>The router described here is a little different then mine (mine is 8.2 revision), but I figured out that things should be alike.</p><p>So, I had a Cisco serial - RJ45 cable, which I connected to router and my laptop, which had a serial port. Alhough the serial section on a router mainboard was placed differently than on my example, I&#039;m pretty sure I got the cabling right. I used this article as a manual, Table A-5 to be exact:</p><p><a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/pix/pix70/hw/installation/guide/append.html#wp1006200">http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/securit … #wp1006200</a><br />So, I connected cable like that:</p><p>RX - 3 pin<br />TX - 6 pin<br />GND - 4 pin (tried on 5 pin, without any result).</p><p>So, I used Putty to connect to router with baud rate 115200, data bits - 8, stop bits - 1, and parity with flow control - none, as I find out in forums and ... got an unreadable output. It was a section of unreadable symbols, repeating over and over again. I checked all the baud rates I could possibly find without any results. Also, I double checked cabling and made sure everything was as it supposed to be.<br />So, do anybody have any idea that my problem might be? I would appreciate any help, because I don&#039;t have any clue what to do. Any help would be awesome.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>you MUST NOT USE a RS232 port without an adapter, and you should stop trying, you can permanently fry the serial line of your router if you throw in more than 3.3V!</p><p>RS232 can work with 12V!</p><p>read for example:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd#serial">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd#serial</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for you answer. I suppose I got it all wrong, but I don&#039;t use VCC pin, so how can I fry the serial line if I don&#039;t pass power through it? I use only RX (receive), TX (transfer) and GRD (ground) pins to connect to it.</p><p>There&#039;s another option eventually. I looked at home and found usb to serial adapter, something like that:</p><p><a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/USB-to-RS232-RS-232-Serial-DB9-9-Pin-Adapter-Converter-/131005833858?pt=US_Parallel_Serial_PS_2_Cables_Adapters&amp;hash=item1e808e6282">http://www.ebay.com/itm/USB-to-RS232-RS … 1e808e6282</a></p><p>Can I use it instead of usb - serial cable? I wouldn&#039;t like to wait a month to get a new cable on ebay (that&#039;s how long it gonna take to ship it to Lithuania ;D).</p><p>If that wouldn&#039;t work for some reason - maybe you have some tutorial which cable to buy and how to connect it to router?</p><p>Thanks again.</p>									</div>

					<p>TX an RX line on standard RS232 have higher voltage than a TTL adapter. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> Buy a cheap adapter (you can find them for $2 on ebay).</p>									</div>
