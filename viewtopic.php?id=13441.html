					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I have got a WRT54GL, Version 1.1, and after a storm, some LAN ports (1 and 3) and the WAN port seem to be defective (I simply get no link). LAN ports 2 and 4 are still working as a charm (how this can happen beats me <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink"/> ), WiFi is still working, the Webinterface is there, etc. Therefore, it would be great if I could get the router to use one of the LAN ports for WAN instead---one LAN port is enough for me (I&#039;ll use a switch anyway), but I&#039;d hate to have to buy a new router...</p><p>Is this at all possible? If it is, does anyone by any chance have any pointers on how this could be achieved? I searched the firmware (just upgraded the router to the latest X-Wrt), but I couldn&#039;t find anything...</p><p>Thanks for any input,<br/>finr.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah, that&#039;s possible. It can be configured by changing the vlan0 and vlan1 options in the switch section in /etc/config/network.</p><p>Using UCI (example is for a WRT54GL v1.1 and OpenWrt Kamikaze):<br/></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>uci set network.eth0.vlan0=&quot;2 5*&quot;
uci set network.eth0.vlan1=&quot;0 5&quot;
uci commit network &amp;&amp; reboot</code></pre></div><p>After a reboot LAN (vlan0, eth0.0) is LAN 2 now and WAN (vlan1, eth0.1) is LAN 4.</p><p>The mapping is a bit strange, because it&#039;s in reverse order <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad"/><br/></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>WAN   = Switch port 4
LAN 1 = Switch port 3
LAN 2 = Switch port 2
LAN 3 = Switch port 1
LAN 4 = Switch port 0</code></pre></div>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>forum2006</strong> on 18 Nov 2007, 17:15)</p>

					<p>Hm, no, I double-checked the commands. What was puzzling is that my router doesn&#039;t even have a file /etc/config/network. Well, anyway, I&#039;m glad that I was able to revive the router <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile"/></p>									</div>

					<p>Just an update, I tried using the UCI commands and fudged it with not using &quot;&quot; quotes on a remote router and had a heck of a time explaining to a non-techy how to put it into fail safe mode (holding reset button for 2 seconds after the DMZ light powers up).</p><p>Anyhow, in the latest Kamakazie (7.09) you can edit it in the configuration file /etc/config/network</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config switch eth0
        option vlan0    &quot;0 1 2 3 5*&quot;
        option vlan1    &quot;4 5&quot;</code></pre></div><p>much easier then commands.</p>									</div>
