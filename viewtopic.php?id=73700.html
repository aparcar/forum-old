					<p>Yesterday I connected my old router, which runs on stock firmware (WR1042ND-v2) to my current router, (WR1043ND-v4, which is running the latest LEDE build made for it) using an Ethernet cable. </p><p>However, when I decided to run a speed test to my old router and compared it to my current one, which runs on LEDE, the down/up speeds were like 50% higher than on my current router with LEDE. </p><p>My speed results are as follows (Measured in speedtest.net):</p><p>` Internet plan promises:<br />~100Mbps down<br />~33Mbps up</p><p>* WR1042ND-v2 with stock firmware / Wired:<br />~94Mbps down<br />~35Mbps up</p><p>* WR1042ND-v2 with stock firmware / Wi-Fi connected:<br />~81Mbps down<br />~35Mbps up</p><p>** WR1043ND-v4 with latest LEDE as of today (April 1, 2018) / Wired:<br />~94Mbps down<br />~35Mbps up</p><p>** WR1043ND-v4 with latest LEDE as of today (April 1, 2018) / Wi-Fi connected:<br />~44Mbps down<br />~22Mbps up</p><p>* WR1042ND-v2 Wi-Fi settings / Channel - 8 (Auto) (All the settings are the default ones, I haven&#039;t changed anything, as the router&#039;s SSID can suggest and I have ran those speed tests after a factory reset):</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZppW3vp.png" alt="https://i.imgur.com/ZppW3vp.png" /></span></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1O7bGhn.png" alt="https://i.imgur.com/1O7bGhn.png" /></span></p><p>** WR1043ND-v4 Wi-Fi settings:</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/q5xohUf.png" alt="https://i.imgur.com/q5xohUf.png" /></span></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LLs24hu.png" alt="https://i.imgur.com/LLs24hu.png" /></span></p><p>As you can see, there&#039;s a big difference in the down/up speeds in LEDE, compared to TP-Link&#039;s stock firmware.

					<p>i have a feeling the reason why you are observing a difference in wireless speeds between stock and openwrt is due to the difference in their channel width setting.&nbsp; i think to make them closer to parity, try changing the channel width to 20M in your WR1042ND-v2 stock firmware wireless setting and retest again.</p>									</div>

Check out these speedtests:</p><p>20MHz:</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/J67bFss.jpg" alt="https://i.imgur.com/J67bFss.jpg" /></span></p><p>40MHz and Auto:</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KuoIh3y.jpg" alt="https://i.imgur.com/KuoIh3y.jpg" /></span></p><p>Those tests make me believe that my current router is stuck in the 20MHz width for some reason, because even if I choose 40MHz, it shows me the same results when I do a speedtest.. That&#039;s weird.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ProudlyTM</strong> on 2 Apr 2018, 13:45)</p>

					<p>it&#039;s my understanding the final 802.11n standard calls for the radio to operate in 20mhz channel width even when you have set channel width at 40mhz, when it senses the presence of neighboring 802.11 radio signals operating in the same channel-- interference.</p><p>it&#039;s quite possible the WR1042ND-v2 stock firmware is a pre-n or a draft 802.11n version hence not &quot;neighbor-friendly&quot; and it continues to broadcast in 40mhz despite the presence of neighboring 802.11 radio signals.</p>									</div>

					<p>perhaps decreasing the transmit power setting to a level that it no longer detects neighboring 802.11 radio signals.&nbsp; that should make the router broadcast in 40mhz channel width.&nbsp; the downside to that approach is potentially weaker wireless range.</p><p>i think the issue is more related to the 2.4ghz band being too congested for 40mhz channel width to properly work without any interference.</p>									</div>
