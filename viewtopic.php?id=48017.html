					<p>I&#039;m trying to wrap my mind around the full sequence of events from an interface coming up (or its address changing) to the scripts in /etc/hotplug.d/iface being called. I&#039;m specifically interested in this for ddns purposes (ddns-scripts packages drops a 25-ddns script there), but the discussion should apply more generally.</p><p>I start in the kernel, where subsystems can inject a uevent using kobject_uevent:<br /><a href="http://lxr.linux.no/linux+v3.12.6/lib/kobject_uevent.c#L322">http://lxr.linux.no/linux+v3.12.6/lib/k … ent.c#L322</a></p><p>That takes an enum for the action, which is stringified according to this LUT for inclusion in the netlink message as &quot;ACTION=&quot;:<br /><a href="http://lxr.linux.no/linux+v3.12.6/lib/kobject_uevent.c#L45">http://lxr.linux.no/linux+v3.12.6/lib/k … vent.c#L45</a><br />The possible values are: add, remove, change, move, online, offline.</p><p>I looked around linux/net/ for call sites of kobject_uevent and it seems like net only delivers add/remove for devices as a whole, plus change for a few protocol/driver specific cases like rfkill. No interface address change events? Anyway, let&#039;s continue..</p><p>From here procd appears to create a netlink socket and pump events out of it:<br /><a href="http://nbd.name/gitweb.cgi?p=luci2/procd.git;a=blob;f=plug/hotplug.c;h=ca1e823b65c5fdeac1c5d30f2633669abb2e5a56;hb=HEAD#l451">http://nbd.name/gitweb.cgi?p=luci2/proc … =HEAD#l451</a></p><p>There doesn&#039;t seem to be much event-specific handling in C code, but there is a mini domain-specific language (why a new language instead of bash or lua?) expressed in JSON that takes care of certain subsystems specially:<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/package/procd/files/hotplug.json?rev=36994">https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/p … ?rev=36994</a></p><p>netifd *also* creates a netlink socket and pumps events out of it:<br /><a href="http://nbd.name/gitweb.cgi?p=luci2/netifd.git;a=blob;f=system-linux.c;h=db78240a59662de9ee548d830ad5ac04fe81a0a9;hb=HEAD#l141">http://nbd.name/gitweb.cgi?p=luci2/neti … =HEAD#l141</a></p><p>netifd seems to handle &quot;add&quot; and &quot;remove&quot; events only, using them to update internal state about device presence and to rebroadcast state changes to internal subscribers. I see calls to device_claim in alias.c, bridge.c, vlan.c, a few others. Do these events somehow end up on ubus? Are there any bash scripts (ala /etc/hotplug.d) executed as a result of these events? examples/hotplug-cmd seems to be a hotplug script, when does this come into play?</p><p>Going back to procd, the openwrt hotplug.json, for &quot;net&quot; events, runs /sbin/hotplug-call %SUBSYSTEM%. This runs the scripts in /etc/hotplug.d/net with environment from the uevent:<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/package/procd/files/hotplug.json?rev=36994#L71">https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/p … =36994#L71</a></p><p>hotplug.json has no configuration for SUBSYSTEM=iface. Are these events swallowed? What about the &quot;ifup&quot; and &quot;ifdown&quot; values for ACTION? (these are documented on the wiki: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/hotplug">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/hotplug</a> and used by the scripts in /etc/hotplug.d/iface) I&#039;m starting to think SUBSYSTEM=iface may not actually exist..</p><p>Does uevent deliver events only for device add/remove, or also when an interface alias is created? What about when the addresses of an interface change? I tried answering some of these questions by running &#039;strace -f -p 1&#039; (stracing procd) and bringing up an alias of lo (ifconfig lo:1 1.1.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0) but it didn&#039;t seem to get any events. I also tried stracing netifd, again with no visible effects. I can&#039;t easily play with the other interface on this router because it&#039;s in active use.</p><p>The reason I&#039;m doing this is I suspect ddns-scripts is not being triggered when my WAN interface gets an IP. It has the following script in /etc/hotplug.d/iface/25-ddns:<br />#!/bin/sh</p><p>. /usr/lib/ddns/dynamic_dns_functions.sh</p><p>if [ &quot;$ACTION&quot; = &quot;ifup&quot; ]; then<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; start_daemon_for_all_ddns_sections &quot;$INTERFACE&quot;<br />fi</p><br /><p>In my case the WAN proto is DHCP - I want an event when WAN gets an IP (*after* the underlying network device has come up). What is the best hook to trigger for this? I have another router that uses PPP on wan so I&#039;m looking for a generic solution.</p><p>Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eigma</strong> on 26 Dec 2013, 05:01)</p>

					<p>Aha, from netifd interface-event.c:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; char *eventnames[] = {&quot;ifdown&quot;, &quot;ifup&quot;, &quot;ifupdate&quot;};<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; setenv(&quot;ACTION&quot;, eventnames[event], 1);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; setenv(&quot;INTERFACE&quot;, ifname, 1);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; if (device)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; setenv(&quot;DEVICE&quot;, device, 1);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; argv[0] = hotplug_cmd_path;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; argv[1] = &quot;iface&quot;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; argv[2] = NULL;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; execvp(argv[0], argv);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; exit(127);</p><p>netifd&#039;s cycle appears to be:<br />- Start some proto-specific mechanism for acquiring interface configuration. For DHCP this is driven by proto-shell.c, which spawns /lib/netifd/proto/dhcp.sh, which is a thin wrapper around udhcpc. udhcpc is long-lived and set up to call back into /lib/netifd/dhcp.script for dhcp events:<br />&nbsp; 833 root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1488 S&nbsp; &nbsp; udhcpc -p /var/run/udhcpc-eth1.pid -s /lib/netifd/dhcp.script -f -t 0 -i eth1 -C</p><p>- dhcp.script packages variables from udhcpc into json and end up doing &#039;ubus call network.interface notify_proto &lt;json&gt;&#039;. This in turn is handled by netifd in proto-shell.c, in proto_shell_notify. Action is 0, which leads into proto_shell_update_link.</p><p>- proto_shell_update_link delivers an event to the interface through state-&gt;proto.proto_event (interface_proto_cb), which calls interface_event, which leads to the snippet above, calling into /sbin/hotplug-call with ACTION=ifupdate.</p>									</div>

					<p>For anyone who is having issues for interface up and down events for Attitude Adjustment (AA), you might want to check out the patches provided by Hans Dedecker which don&#039;t appear to have been incorporated into AA. Here is a link to the mailing list thread where these patches can be found (check out patch 7 and 8).<br /><a href="https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/2013-November/022538.html">https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/ope … 22538.html</a></p><p>Perhaps someone could get them added to AA to allow for this capability?</p>									</div>

					<p>It would appear that the Hans Dedecker patches _did_ make it into the upstream netifd sources, but the default commit used by the tip of AA for the netifd package is old. You should be able to pick up these changes by changing which netifd commit hash you use (edit the package/netifd/Makefile in your copy of AA). I can&#039;t promise this won&#039;t break something, nor can I suggest which commit hash would be a stable hash to go with.&nbsp; The netifd commit hash that includes the Han patches is:<br />7335c3e19ea09674245dda3653d3f40705e68d6b</p><p>Hopefully someone with more experience can comment on more stable commit hash that includes these patches that should be used for AA. Thanks.</p>									</div>
