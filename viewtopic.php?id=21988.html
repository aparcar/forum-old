					<p>Hallo,</p><p>I need a new router and I would like it to be openwrt-friendly, but it&#039;s very hard for me to find one that fits my needs. (And yes I&#039;ve tried look through the hardware list on the wiki <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> )</p><p>I want a 802.11n capable router and I would like it to have a decent amount of flash, so I don&#039;t run out of space on the device like I do on my old Linksys WRT54GL.</p><p>The reason I need a new router is that the WDS setup I&#039;ve at the moment is so unstable that I almost can&#039;t go online for an extended period, and I&#039;ve use way too much time on fixing it. <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=21820">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=21820</a></p><p>I assume that a good 802.11n capable router will have the little extra signal I need to drop the WDS setup. I don&#039;t need much more a few meters should do it.</p><p>And I hope to get a better PC-to-PC transfer speed than the max 750kB/s I&#039;ve at the moment.</p><p>So please, can one or more of you recommend a new router for me?</p>									</div>
