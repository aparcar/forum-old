					<p>Hi All,</p><p>Thanks again for the feedback it has been very helpful.</p><p>We have agreed to make an initial device that may not appease everyone but will target as many features as possible given time and price.&nbsp; </p><p>If we don&#039;t here some strong advice to a specific chip, we are leaning towards the BCM5354 as a starting point (if we can get broadcom to sell them to a small developer).&nbsp; I do appreciate the advice that Broadcom&#039;s driver situation is difficult.&nbsp; This is something we will have to keep our eyes on.&nbsp; </p><p>From your feedback, this is how our &quot;base&quot; unit requirements are shaping up:</p><p>Minimum:<br />-200 MHZ+ Processor (probably BCM5354 @ 266)<br />-32MB Flash / 128MB SDRAM <br />-USB 2.0 Host Controller, at least wired to header if not a connector<br />-TTL headers (probably use MAX3232 like IC to convert to RS232 and possibly wired to DB9 Female)<br />-802.11G Radio (probably integrated on SoC) wired to removable antenna<br />-1 10/100 WAN and 1 10/100 LAN (looking into GiG-E)</p><p>Still Evaluating:<br />PCI<br />PCI-E<br />Crypto / VPN<br />x86 Processors</p><br /><br /><p>We will sell or link to a passive PoE injector and splitter pair for those who need it.</p><p>Nothing here is &quot;dead set&quot; just yet so please continue to help us here!</p><p>Thanks<br />phiz</p>									</div>

					<p>Your specs look good to me eve though it only comes with a single (preferably four) LAN port. One can always attach switches to it. If possible, make the router with a standard modular RAM (with additional empty modular RAM socket) so that end users will be able to plug and/or replace it with a much bigger standard capacity modular RAM.</p>									</div>

					<p>i&#039;d cast my vote in favour of atheros as well. for the mesh project I&#039;m working on I can&#039;t use broadcom as it randomly uses the BSSID of a neighbour instead of the assigned value.</p>									</div>

					<p>How about you take a look at Mikrotik Routerboard. They are a little narrow in their offerings, and you could easily pare down what they offer (a bit) and fill in the spaces they don&#039;t offer anything.</p><p>For instance, I want an 8-port gig-e switch that can route, which you can have USB and some mini-pci ports for wireless. Then you can custom build this sort of thing with people. You can generally build a pretty modular system and offer it at a lower price. Not to mention how complex MikroT makes it to purchase the routers.</p>									</div>
