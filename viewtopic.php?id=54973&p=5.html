					<p>Ok, thanks for the info. It does seem kind of slow though. In the smallnetbuilder test the Linksys EA8500, which has the exact same CPU (IPQ8064) as the Archer, scores 58.7 MB/s. And that&#039;s on NTFS, which I can only assume is through FUSE.</p><p>As for wget, the busybox variant is compiled without SSL by default. I&#039;ll enable that for a future build, but as you noticed there is curl <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Maybe it is a caching problem. When I run the dd command with 1GB it uses all the free memory (350MB) to cache the data.<br />If I create a file with only 300MB, I get a write speed of 46MB/s.</p><p>Do you know how I could disable the caching to test the speed?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Guys,</p><p>first thanks for creating the images for the archer c2600 <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.<br />My Archer C2600 came today and im currently playing around with it. </p><p>I just thought about installing openwrt on the router to use the great eatures. I&#039;m really new to openwrt, so please excuse me if some of my questions might be stupid:</p><p>1. Is there a dedicated tutorial for installing the firmware (arokh&#039;s image) on the Archer C2600?<br />2. Is my understanding right, that i can flash the &quot;factory&quot; Image directly over the stock firmware&#039;s update function?<br />3. What will be the ip of the router after flashing the firmware?<br />4. When i want to update afterwards to a new version of&nbsp; arokhs mage - then i will need the sysupgrade image, right?</p><p>Thank you very much!<br />Regards,<br />powerlinemk</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi powerlinemk, welcome to openwrt.<br />Yes your understanding is correct. You just download the firmware (openwrt-ipq806x-C2600-squashfs-factory.bin) and update it in the web interface.<br />The IP after the update is 192.168.1.1.<br />To update the firmware after you installed openwrt, you download the new sysupdate image (openwrt-ipq806x-C2600-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin) and update it in the web interface from openwrt.</p>									</div>

					<p>All: thank you very much for your excellent work on the C2600 image. It is just what this excellent piece of hardware needs. It is so much faster and more reliable than the stock firmware of TP-Link (of which the latest version is more than 3 months old).&nbsp; The stock firmware gave me issues with WAN not receiving an Ip address from my ISP, my Synology NAS randomly not appearing on my LG 42LA8609 television (DLNA) and no option of link aggregation. So, again: thanks a lot.</p><p>The only thing I came across is that I&#039;m not able to set fixed IP addresses via Static Leases. I get the: &quot;Some fields are invalid, cannot save values!&quot; message. I left the IPv6 suffix blank. I couldn&#039;t find anything generic on this, therefore I&#039;m wondering whether this is something specific for this build (I use arokh v48005) or whether I&#039;m overseeing something. Sorry if this is too much a newbie question.</p><p>Edit: it appeared to be a newbie issue: I tried to use a space in the hostname. Quite stupid, of course, but the error message could have been cleared (ie: mentioning which field causes the issue, for example).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Videopac</strong> on 2 Jan 2016, 21:04)</p>

					<p>For me it is working very good. <br />My setup is a 5 ghz bridge to the main router and it is sending a new 2.4ghz wlan network to expand the range...<br />I have a updtime of over 4 days.
