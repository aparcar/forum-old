					<p>Totally agree and have a similar setup (based on your previous success stories, actually). Mine doesn&#039;t do much web server stuff, but it does handle IPv6 and a rather busy network with no hassle. I too compile and upgrade the trunk build about every 1-2 weeks. Solid over and over again.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yep, I have run 6rd, 6to4 (HE.net) and now native, all work wonderfully. I run radvd on the RSPro and DHCPv6 on a Windows server.</p><p>I run two of the SparkLAN WMIA-199N cards (Atheros AR9160, 3T/3R dual band), and some basic ~7dBi omnis. Like robrob I&#039;ve got the RSPro in the basement and that doesn&#039;t make for really great long-range coverage. Right now I&#039;m trying to get a TerraWave patch antenna to hang on the wall and broadcast across the house. The SparkLAN cards though, for the price ($54-ish), I can wholeheartedly recommend for just about any home setup.</p><p>On the software front, OpenWrt r28442 has been very stable over the last 14 days although I&#039;ve never really had a problem upgrading to the latest trunk at any time.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>doogie</strong> on 29 Oct 2011, 21:30)</p>

					<p>Update: I have added OpenVpn to the RouterStation Pro and it&#039;s now serving up VPN connections--still no sweat.</p><p>I also added a Sparclan WUSB-505 V2 WiFi USB stick as a third wireless access point and it&#039;s working great. The connection is very fast and very stable--faster than any other Atheros or Ralink based USB stick I&#039;ve tried and comparable to the mini-pci 11n cards in my RS Pro.</p>									</div>
