					<p>I have set up my OpenWrt router to get a IPv6 subnet from SixXS. This works, from the router itself I can connect to IPv6 servers on the internet. I have also set up radv and get an IPv6 address on my local workstation via DHCP. So I can connect to the router via IPv6. The setup follows this guide:<br /><a href="http://www.sixxs.net/wiki/Aiccu/Installing_on_OpenWRT#Subnet_Configuration">http://www.sixxs.net/wiki/Aiccu/Install â€¦ figuration</a><br />When I traceroute -6 to an internet server, it stops at first hop on the router. When I ping6 to some server, I get no replies.</p><p>What can I do to analyze this problem?</p>									</div>

					<p>It is long time ago since I have used old Backfire, but you could read this for pointers:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27541">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27541</a><br />(You can forget about the firewall stuff, as 10.03.1 maintenace release already has the then new firewall2.)</p><p>Have you given correctly the ipv6 address from the routed /64 segment to the LAN interface of the router. (The tunnel interface has the tunnel endpoint address, but you need to give local LAN interface a proper address from the routed segment.</p><p>If you want more detailed analysis, you should provide the key segments from /etc/config/network and radvd.</p><p>In general, you should update to AA 12.09.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 8 Aug 2013, 13:43)</p>

					<p>Other point is that Aiccu is not really supported by Openwrt eves any more. Its integration has been dropped from AA12.09 and trunk. If you search the forum (and Sixxs discussion forum), you can find some hot discussion about that.</p><p>I use a static Sixxs tunnel and it works great with both AA and trunk.</p>									</div>

					<p>Just I found this message:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39117">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39117</a><br />it says: <br /><strong>EOL Notice for brcm-2.4:<br />Kernel 2.4 support has been dropped from Attitude Adjustment. For most devices using brcm47xx images is fine, but older models with only 16 MiB RAM or slower CPUs (200 Mhz) will not run properly with it. So for those devices, sticking with backfire is recommended.</strong><br />Because that applies to my Linksys WRT54GL I am afraid AA is not for me. A quick installation on a spare box showed it is very unresponsive.</p><p>What do you mean by static SiXXs tunnel?</p>									</div>
