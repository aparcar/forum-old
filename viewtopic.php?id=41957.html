					<p>Connect your Dslr camera with USB to second Android device. After the Dslr camera is recognised by DslrDashboard in menu you can select the &#039;Start Network client&#039; option. After that you will get a dialog where you need to enter the IP from the server (the IP that was displayed when you started the server). After a short time the client Android device will switch of the screen and the server Android will take full control of your Dslr camera.</p><p>To return control of camera to client Android device in menu select &#039;Stop Network client&#039;, that will close the network connection to server and return the control over camera to client Android.</p><p>To stop the Network server select &#039;Stop Network server&#039; on your Android device that was acting as server device.</p><p>You can connect more clients to the server and switch between them. The server can also have a camera connected via USB.</p><p>Thanks<br />Regards</p><p>Sormita</p>									</div>

					<p>Great job!</p><p>I am also trying to make ddserver work on a TL-WR703N router (quite similar to the MR3020, only smaller and with fewer LEDs). Currently I am out of luck.</p><p>Tried to install the package on a OpenWrt with luci installed, but not enough memory. Tried to remove Luci but to no avail. So next thing I try to make a .bin for the router compiled from source with the ddserver included in the build. Is there any way to do this?</p><p>This guide:<br /><a href="http://www.thepowerbase.com/2012/01/openwrt-build-guide-start-to-finish/">http://www.thepowerbase.com/2012/01/ope … to-finish/</a></p><p>shows how to include various packgages from the standard OpenWrt feeds into the build environment for OpenWrt. But ddserver is not found in any feed. Is there a way to get it into my build environment? I am using Debian 6.0.7 running on VMWare in Windows 7 pro by the way.</p><p>Another related question what packages can be safely excluded from the standard 71xxx build without bricking the router? Would like to have room for both luci and ddserver on the router if possible, but I might have to kick out some other parts to achieve this.</p><p>Anyone know of a prebuilt image containing ddserver for the TL-WR703N router by the way?</p>									</div>

					<p>Huh, is this the answer for compiling with included ddserver to the image? (taken from the documentation on Google code)<br />&gt; Clone the DslrDashboardServer repository to the packages directory on OpenWrt:<br />&gt;<br />&gt; git clone git://github.com/hubaiz/DslrDashboardServer packages/DslrDashboardServer<br />&gt; Run then the following commands:<br />&gt;<br />&gt; execute<br />&gt; make menuconfig</p><p>I thought &quot;OpenWRT&quot; was litterally the OpenWrt installation, not the OpenWRT build environment.
