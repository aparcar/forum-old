					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am working in a build for tl-wr703n including nas and some other features which I will share soon. Since the space is so limited Luci package cannot be included. Actually in my opinion the Luci inteface is not really that useful and I have made a few shell scripts to easily do common tasks instead.</p><p>One of my shell scripts is used to show a list of available wifi networks and automatically connect to the one you select.</p><p>This is an example of how it looks when running it:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/# conf_wifi_client
Available WIFI networks:
    1 : &quot;daikanyama&quot;    (secure) (Signal strength: 100%)
    2 : &quot;MyPlace&quot;       (secure) (Signal strength: 58%)
    3 : &quot;au_Wi-Fi&quot;      (secure) (Signal strength: 42%)
    4 : &quot;007Z_344B599&quot;  (secure) (Signal strength: 38%)
    5 : &quot;Wi2premium&quot;    (open)   (Signal strength: 40%)
    6 : &quot;Wi2premium cl&quot; (secure) (Signal strength: 40%)
Enter the numeric option for your selected network: 3
Enter password of the selected WIFI network: ************


Trying to connect to WIFI network.
(Wait a few seconds and check status with: iwconfig )</code></pre></div><p>The script only works if you have an active wifi interface in &#039;sta&#039; mode.</p><p>Here is the code. You just need to copy all the code in a file, for example &quot;conf_wifi_client&quot;, put it in the /bin directory or wherever you want and give it run permissions with:&nbsp; chmod +x &lt;filename&gt;<br />The only thing you will need to modify a little bit is the uci commands in the end of the script. Just change them to match the labels of your wireless config file.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>killall -9 wpa_supplicant
