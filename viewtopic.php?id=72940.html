					<p>The OpenWrt and the LEDE project are happily announcing the unification<br />of both projects under the OpenWrt name.</p><p>After long and sometimes slowly moving discussions about the specifics<br />of the re-merge, with multiple similar proposals but little subsequent<br />action, we&#039;re happy to announce that both projects are about to execute<br />the final steps of the merger.</p><p>The new, unified OpenWrt project will be governed under the rules <br />established by the LEDE project, which can be found at<br /><a href="https://lede-project.org/rules">https://lede-project.org/rules</a> . Active members of both the former LEDE<br />and OpenWrt projects will continue working on the unified OpenWrt.</p><p>LEDE&#039;s spinoff and subsequent re-merge into OpenWrt will not alter the<br />overall technical direction taken by the unified project. We will<br />continue to work on improving stability and release maintenance while<br />aiming for frequent minor releases to address critical bugs and security<br />issues like we did with LEDE 17.01 and its four point releases until now.</p><p>Old pre-15.05 OpenWrt CC releases will not be supported by the merged<br />project anymore, leaving these releases without any future security or<br />bug fixes. The OpenWrt CC 15.05 release series will receive a limited<br />amount of security and bug fixes, but is not yet fully integrated in our<br />release automation, so binary releases are lacking behind for now.</p><p>The LEDE 17.01 release will continue to get full security and bug fix<br />support for both source code and binary releases.<br />We are planning a new major release under the new name in the next few<br />months.</p><p>The merged project will use the code base of the former LEDE project.<br />OpenWrt specific patches not present in the LEDE repository but meeting<br />LEDEs code quality requirements got integrated into the new tree. The<br />source code is hosted at<br /><a href="https://git.openwrt.org/?p=openwrt/openwrt.git;a=summary">https://git.openwrt.org/?p=openwrt/open â€¦ ;a=summary</a> with a<br />continuously synchronized Github mirror hosted at<br /><a href="https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt">https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt</a> . We accept patches sent to our<br />mailing list via openwrt at lists.infradead.org (is still being setup) or<br />Github pull requests to <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt">https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt</a> .</p><p>Yet open pull requests to both the old OpenWrt and LEDE repositories<br />will be closed after a 30 day grace period. We encourage people to open<br />new pull requests at the new repository or re-send still unmerged patches.</p><p>The remerged OpenWrt project is legally represented by the Software in<br />the Public Interest (SPI) - an US 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.<br />(see <a href="https://www.spi-inc.org/projects/openwrt/">https://www.spi-inc.org/projects/openwrt/</a> ) The SPI is managing our<br />OpenWrt trademark, handling our donations and helping us with legal<br />problems.</p><p>The original OpenWrt codebase has been archived for future reference and<br />is hosted at <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/archive">https://github.com/openwrt/archive</a> .</p><p>The bug tracker is available at <a href="https://bugs.openwrt.org">https://bugs.openwrt.org</a> with previously<br />reported LEDE project issues migrated to it.</p><p>Old pre-15.05 OpenWrt CC releases, which are not supported any more, can<br />be found at <a href="http://archive.openwrt.org">http://archive.openwrt.org</a> .</p><p>Infrastructure currently available under the lede-project.org domain<br />will be moved to corresponding openwrt.org subdomains and redirects will<br />be put in place where appropriate.</p><p>The old OpenWrt buildbot infrastructure will be shut down and its<br />compute resources integrated with the existing LEDE infrastructure in<br />order to maintain build coverage of current and future releases.</p><p>The merger of the OpenWrt and LEDE forums and wikis is not yet fully<br />decided, so all portals will continue to be available under their<br />respective domains until a definite consensus is reached.</p><p>OpenWrt project</p>									</div>
