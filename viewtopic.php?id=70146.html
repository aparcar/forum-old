					<p>Hi all!</p><p>I&#039;ve been getting a Privacy Error when connecting to Lucy ( 192.168.1.1) using Chrome.

					<p>Are you using luci-ssl? If so i think that&#039;s what&#039;s causing this, i believe you have to generate a self-signed certificate when using https, unfortunately i don&#039;t use it myself and haven&#039;t really looked into it so i can&#039;t be of much help, but maybe this will point you in the right direction - </p><p><a href="http://fabianlee.org/2016/09/19/openwrt-enabling-https-for-the-luci-web-admin-interface/">http://fabianlee.org/2016/09/19/openwrt … interface/</a></p>									</div>

					<p>The browser will throw this error when it finds a self-signed certificate.&nbsp; You can either disable https mode in uhttpd or tell the browser to allow an exception.</p><p>Having an authority sign a real certificate for your router would almost certainly cost money.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 8 Mar 2017, 15:52)</p>

					<p>Thanks guys!

					<p>You need to set up the forward so it also translates the port to local port 80.&nbsp; Or configure uhttpd to listen on port 8080.</p><p>Opening luci to the internet isn&#039;t very secure.&nbsp; SSH tunnel would be much better.</p>									</div>

					<p>Disabling SSL is not the right move to avoid warning, it didn&#039;t solve the issue, instead, it make a big security risk because all your information/password are sending by plain html, it&#039;s a suicide when transfer over internet.</p><p>What you should do:<br />1. Re-enable SSL.<br />2. Make sure there&#039;s no untrusted clients in your Lan, then visit Luci https through Lan.<br />3. When you get the warning again, click &quot;view certificate&quot;, and take a screenshot of the fingerprint. <br />4. Add a permanent exception in the browser, so the warning won&#039;t show again aslong as the certificate do not change.</p><p>Also, always connect Luci by https through Wan.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sam1275</strong> on 8 Mar 2017, 22:50)</p>
