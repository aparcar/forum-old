					<p>I just installed the attitude adjustment rc1 on my wdr4300 today and it works but the wireless is a bit slow/buggy. So I was wondering if I could just upgrade it to the bleeding edge through the gui and if that would cause any problems. Would there be any fixes in the bleeding edge trunk for the wdr4300 to make the wireless any better?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>4300</strong> on 10 Jan 2013, 17:28)</p>

					<p>I don&#039;t need to measure it. The stock firmware had better wireless range and/or bandwidth on both 2.4 and 5 GHz. There is also no channels 12 and 13 available. Simple example the wife&#039;s laptop used to connect at 150Mbps and now it only connects at 72Mbps The 40Mhz doesn&#039;t seem to work either.</p><p>I tried the trunk and after sussing out how to install luci I couldn&#039;t get the wireless to work at all. So I reverted back to the RC1. </p><p>I also had a problem that after changing the wireless settings a few times with luci the wireless functionality got progressively worse and the only solution was to backup the config, reset and reload the config and then just not touch the wireless settings. It&#039;s stable but not optimum.</p><p>I&#039;d still be interested to know if there was a way to just update the wireless stuff and how I could improve it as I&#039;m pretty happy with the rest.</p>									</div>

					<p>Do you think it could have something to do with <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/12372">this</a>? As far as I can see, there have been no reports of the WDR4300 being affected, but I think it very well could be: unless I&#039;m mistaken, the platforms are the same. For what it&#039;s worth, I&#039;m still on stock and holding out until this gets fixed, but the ticket has not been updated in twelve days.</p>									</div>

The problem I had isn&#039;t the wireless signal deteriorating after time on its own, it was getting worse/unstable/buggy after repeatedly changing settings with luci. Which is why after resetting and loading the config I just don&#039;t touch the wireless settings at all unless I&#039;m willing to reset and reload due to the wireless possibly giving up.</p><p>If you rely heavily on a strong fast wireless signal then the stock is way better. The stock might have had a stronger/better bandwidth signal but the wife has said this new firmware has made general online surfing more responsive. That&#039;s probably more to do with the stock nat/firewall though.</p><p>This openwrt stuff is pretty hardcore though and I&#039;m struggling to find specifics on getting the wireless improved.</p>									</div>
