					<p>Hello Everyone.</p><p>I have installed OpenWrt firmware &quot;Chaos Calmer 15.05-rc1&quot; with the intent of using it as a hotspot router with the service provided by HotspotSystems.com.</p><p>The firmware flashing went fine, the splash screen prompting me to change my password appeared and configuring the router trough SSH also worked fine, but for the most part I configured all basic settings trough the graphical user interface.</p><p>The problem: After rebooting the router, all settings are just gone, the router acts as if it was never configured it in the first place. It acts as if it was the first time booting OpenWrt.</p><p>I have searched the forum and tried out various commands to try and solve the problem with no success.</p><p>Here is the link to the FTP where I downloaded the firmware from: <a href="http://www.hotspotsystem.com/firmware/openwrt/UBNT/">http://www.hotspotsystem.com/firmware/openwrt/UBNT/</a></p><p>I also tried to go to the &quot;System &gt; Flash Firmware&quot; tab on the GUI and load up the firmware i found here: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ar71xx/generic/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_br … x/generic/</a></p><p>After doing so, nothing seems to have changed, and when I log on trough SSH the &quot;HotspotSystem&quot; domain and splash still appears, meaning the firmware flashing didn&#039;t work?</p><p>I have tried searching for hours for a solution, any help would really be appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>It is because of a new(er) U-Boot installed onto the Ubiquiti devices.&nbsp; You mush downgrade AirOS before installing OpenWRT.&nbsp; Someday it will be fixed in OpenWRT, but for now, this is the solution.</p><p>See:</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=67094">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=67094</a><br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=64326">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=64326</a></p><p><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/ubiquiti/airmaxm">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/ubiquiti/airmaxm</a></p>									</div>
