					<p>what you DO with SSH is that you connect to your router and debug and configure it in various ways as described in the pages that i linked to above.&nbsp; &nbsp;OpenWRT is a (somewhat limited) linux system and you&#039;re logged into a &quot;shell&quot; on it.&nbsp; You are using a &quot;command line interface&quot; (CLI) that is the predecessor of&nbsp; &quot;graphic user interfaces&quot; (GUIs).</p><p>Presumably you are already doing so since you at least tried to install luci and such things. </p><br /><p>You have some existing network.&nbsp; Does that network not have DHCP working on it ?</p><p>Your new router/AP (the d-link) will by default just act as a client on that network.&nbsp; If dhcp is working on the network the d-link would just grab an address like any other computer that you plug into the network.... you shouldn&#039;t need to set it at all.</p><p>For example, on a standard set-up it would look like this:<br />root@OpenWrt:~# uci show network.wan<br />network.wan=interface<br />network.wan.ifname=eth1<br />network.wan.proto=dhcp</p><p>---<br />You seem to have set the IP manually.&nbsp; if you go that route you&#039;ll also have to set a gateway and dns servers (as shown wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/internet.connection&nbsp; under &quot;Ethernet&quot;)</p><p>reading between the lines of what you said above you can probably set both the gateway and the DNS server to <br />192.168.1.1,&nbsp; but if you have DHCP on the existing network it&#039;s probably easiest to just revert the d-link&#039;s wan port to using DHCP so you don&#039;t have to worry about it.</p><p> anyway to see if you have networking&nbsp; try using traceroute from your ssh session </p><p>traceroute -n 4.53.158.42</p><p>then to see if your&nbsp; dns is working just <br />nslookup nytimes.com</p>									</div>

					<p>Hmm... you&#039;ve kind of jumped into the deep end trying to do openwrt.&nbsp; </p><p>Anyway you need to understand:<br />IP address ,&nbsp; netmask and gateway (they work together).&nbsp; &nbsp; (and &quot;gateway&quot; is usually short for &quot;default gateway&quot;)</p><p>and what DNS does and why you need it.</p><p>and what DHCP does.</p><p>And you also need to understand what&nbsp; NAT is (&quot;network address translation&quot;).&nbsp; &nbsp;And realize that at least one of the boxes you already have (probably the cisco &quot;switch&quot; is probably not a switch but a home &quot;router&quot; that is doing NAT already.&nbsp; no guarantee of that, but it&#039;s prob. what&#039;s going on especially since you mentioned something about it doing QoS).&nbsp; </p><p>For your first experiments you&#039;re probably best off plugging in the d-link into your &quot;cisco switch&quot;</p><p>(btw, setting up QoS in a reasonable manner to achieve your wifi throttling goals is about 2 levels of understanding above what it takes to get&nbsp; things basically working)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vhrm</strong> on 3 Mar 2013, 01:20)</p>
