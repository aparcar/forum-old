					<p>Hello! I work in an small agency where we have one AP. For our intern security because our building is big with more companies inside, near us, i want to achieve this thing:</p><p>1) <strong>Explanation:</strong> </p><p>- When any user who is <strong>connected to our AP</strong> go for openwrt.org/page.html (just an example), check if this site is <strong>allowed</strong> by us, if not, <strong>redirect him</strong> to one page to inform that we do not allow that site and he is on his own, (our info page do a redirect in some seconds to the requested page automatically). </p><p>- I want redirect to be able to check for pages not for domains. If it&#039;s possiblle</p><p>- The second time when user try to enter on openwrt.org that redirect should not appear again.</p><p>2) <strong>In Practice:</strong><br />- I type in browser openwrt.org, router receive, check the page/site and <strong>redirect</strong> me to info page. <br />Info page redirect me to openwrt.org after 5 seconds. This time openwrt.org <strong>should work</strong> and so on until 30 days (example).</p><br /><p>How can i do this, first of all i want to know if it&#039;s possiblle inside router by firmware to check all incomming site&#039;s. Some start info would be really apreciated.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drago0sh</strong> on 28 Jan 2017, 15:11)</p>
