					<p>I don&#039;t know this board but if you deleted the bootloader, I&#039;m quite sure your only chance would be flashing it using jtag-interface. But the good news are, as it is a development board, it most likely has a connector for jtag.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 5 Mar 2015, 16:07)</p>
