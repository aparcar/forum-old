					<p>Problem:&nbsp; I, along with several other families, live at the end of a 1/2-mile 1-lane driveway that is very curvy and heavily forrested so you don&#039;t know if someone else is coming the other way until they are right on top of you.&nbsp; When two cars meet each other, it&#039;s a real pain since one of the cars has to back up quite a bit to one of the two turnouts or back to the very beginning to let the other car pass.</p><p>Solution:&nbsp; Have two WRT&#039;s connected to each other wirelessly (probably with antennas) on either end of the driveway and have each control a little light that would be mounted by a sign on a tree that says &quot;Traffic Coming&quot;.&nbsp; If that light is on as you approach, just wait for the car that&#039;s already on the driveway to exit before getting on yourself.</p><p>Method:&nbsp; I need one input (I guess the reset button) and one output (/proc/sys/diag) with the proper circuitry to interface to the outside world.&nbsp; I plan to use break-beam sensors to sense the cars and relays to control the lights.&nbsp; Power to the wrt&#039;s isn&#039;t a problem.</p><br /><p>So, I&#039;ve got most of the programming concepts down but I&#039;m stumped at how to get the two wrt&#039;s to communicate with each other.&nbsp; I need a way to simply pass an alert from one wrt to the other that the sensor was tripped.&nbsp; Once the alert gets to the other wrt, it will keep /proc/sys/diag high until it senses the car pass on its side.&nbsp; Can anyone think of any way to accomplish this passing of the alert?</p><p>One idea I had was to simply do a continuous loop that would wget a file from the other wrt.&nbsp; Normally, the file wouldn&#039;t be there so the wget command wouldn&#039;t be successful but, should the other WRT indeed sense a car, it would &quot;touch&quot; a file on its end which would then be picked up by the other wrt with a successful wget.&nbsp; The file in the source wrt would be deleted seconds later automatically.&nbsp; Two problems - 1) I don&#039;t think I should use files for communication since the flash chip will wear out over time, 2) Seems like a lame way to communicate.</p><p>Any pointers regarding any of this would be helpful.&nbsp; In case it&#039;s useful (and I&#039;m successful) I&#039;ll post back here the source and the schematics in case anybody wants to do anything similar.</p>									</div>

					<p>That is a cool idea.<br />I guess those things are called traffic lights ;-)</p><p>I once read an interesting article about inetd or xinetd, that could be used to write a daemon that is listening on a socket with a few lines of a (b)ash script.

					<p>How about this for a dirty hacked solution:</p><p>Use a wl-500g instead (has parallel port, so its easier to configure - dont need to worry about modding hardware to add serial ports).&nbsp; Use the parallel port essentially as digital I/O.&nbsp; ie binary input on one pin corresponds to the switch, output is to a driver for the light (solid state relay would be easiest).</p><p>Setup samba server on one and use client on other (im not sure this can be done, but i guess so).&nbsp; Have a single file (or two might be better) showing the state of each end.&nbsp; Then need to run a script constantly that loops and does the checking.</p><p>If the road is windy etc - are you sure youll get good signals at each end?</p>									</div>

The idea is to detect objects that are &quot;large enough&quot;. <br />By analyzing the order of interruptions you may get furhter evidence and also distinguish between &quot;car entering&quot; and &quot;car leaving&quot;.</p><p>Daniel</p>									</div>

					<p>On the communication aspect:<br />the two wrt&#039;s don&#039;t even need to be connected in the TCP/IP sense.<br />Both can operate as a station and e.g. by changing the SSID name and a number of other transmission parameters (shortslot, shortpreamble) can indicate the states they are in. Either side can do a &#039;wl scan&#039; for the particular MAC number of the other and get to know a number of parameters of the other side that way, as long as they receive one another. A script with some grep statements in it can keep track of status on either side and give feedback by changing the own transmission parameters.<br />Traffic is a serious matter though, with liability aspects.<br />Make sure that the default is (in case of loss of functionality) don&#039;t go. This kind of signalling tends to lower the attentiveness of the driver and may give a false sense of security. Scripts on both sides that sense the other and change their own state can establish a clear to send and acknowledge system on a high level as long as ultimate speed is not of the essence. <br />Normally a station sends its beacon like 10 times per second, but it can be adjusted.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have written programs to read data from serial ports and parallel ports (on traditional laptop/PCs). Basically you just read the port and wait for data. From what I understand on your project you need to communicate with two different devices. 1) Input from your sensors that detect a car and 2) Output to the sign/light indicating a car is coming. You&#039;ll obviously need a program running to read the input data on both devices. Once a car is detected on WRT1 it has to notify WRT2 to turn on the &quot;car is coming&quot; light. If you don&#039;t want to write a simple client/server program in C (these really are trivial) you could write a simple program to turn the light on and off that would reside on each WRT you could use a system call to &quot;ssh&quot; to execute the command on the remote WRT like: </p><p>system(&quot;ssh remotewrt turnlighton&quot;);</p><p>It sounds like you have logic for determining if a car is entering and/or leaving so you know whether to turn the lights on or off. Here&#039;s the most recent thing I wrote that reads timer info from the serial port:</p><p><a href="http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net/hts/">http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net/hts/</a></p><p>Of course I wrote all that in Perl (except for the small amount of C I stole from &quot;xt&quot; to configure the serial port so I can read from it). If I were to do it for the WRT I would write it in C.</p>									</div>
