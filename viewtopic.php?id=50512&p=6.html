					<p>Thanks for these very usefull informations.<br />I&#039;m a little surprised that this incredible device has not a bigger success with hackers !<br />A linux box, with jack , Toslink, wifi ,USB... at this price ! It is cheaper than a raspberry or arduino !</p><p><strong>Use it as squeezebox :</strong><br />This is very interesting since you can use <a href="http://forums.slimdevices.com/showthread.php?103728-Announce-UPnPBridge-integrate-UPnP-DLNA-players-with-LMS-%28squeeze2upnp%29">UPNP</a> or <a href="http://forums.slimdevices.com/showthread.php?105114-AirPlay-bridge-use-airplay-devices-from-LMS-%28experimental%29">airplay</a> devices like a <strong>squeezebox</strong>. It makes incredible price for a squeezebox audio system with all his advantages (Multiroom, a lot of remote software, web radios, and many more functionalities, <a href="http://schmurtzm.blogspot.fr/2016/04/the-best-music-player-squeezebox.html">see my article about Squeezebox</a>)</p><p><strong>Stream your Windows PC sound to NW11:</strong><br />You can also use it with <a href="http://www.streamwhatyouhear.com/">stream what your hear</a> to send Windows sounds to your M1. No problem with audio files but if you stream a video you will have a delay that can be corrected with good player like VLC or Kodi.</p><br /><p><strong>I keep in mind these informations :</strong><br />- Best price on the market to get upnp / airplay device (22-30$ for M1, 39$ for M2). There a lot of different brand with the same hardware (soundmate M1 or M2, ICY-box IB-MP401, Flylink airmusic, Andoer, Elegiant, Goliton...). Airmusic or soundmate M1 are good terms to find what you want on ebay or aliexpress.<br />- Based on OpenWRT and <a href="http://www.cnx-software.com/2015/04/16/raidsonic-releases-firmware-and-source-code-for-atheros-ar9331-wi-fi-audio-streamer/">firmware sources</a> are available to download. <a href="http://www.raidsonic.de/products/audio_products/audio_streamer/index_en.php?we_objectID=1936">You&#039;ll find these sources here</a>.<br />- Wifi is probably not really good on M1, M2 has an antenna<br />- the new SoundMate WM201 is not open source anymore. <a href="http://www.cnx-software.com/2015/02/20/soundmate-wm201-wi-fi-music-streamer-ezmusic-review/">Review here</a>.<br />- With the right firmware it is possible to use USB for USB key with mp3.<br />- With optical Toslink S/PDIF output, analog chip is probably bypassed which is a good thing<br />- Some interesting articles :<br /></p><ul><li><p><a href="http://www.geekloves.com/downloads/airmusic-firmware.html">Firmware for NW11</a> , <a href="http://www.geekloves.com/airmusic/airmusic-2-0-nw1026a-latest-firmware-release.html">Airmusic 2</a> and <a href="http://www.geekloves.com/airmusic/how-to-upgrade-airmusic-firmware.html">how to upgrade firmware</a>.</p></li><li><p><a href="http://sonoe.strikingly.com/blog/mise-a-jour-firmware">Firmware Multi language for Sounmate M2</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=fr&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fmysku.ru%2Fblog%2Faliexpress%2F36063.html&amp;edit-text=">this russian article</a> is probably the most interesting article on the M2.</p></li><li><p><a href="http://kernelreloaded.com/reverse-engineering-soundmate-m1/">informations about how M1 works</a></p></li><li><p><a href="http://www.cnx-software.com/2014/08/25/uyesee-soundmate-m2-wi-fi-audio-streamer-review/">A good review of the M2</a></p></li><li><p><a href="http://www.raidsonic.de/products/audio_products/audio_streamer/index_en.php?we_objectID=1936">Main page of the raidsonic / ICY-box IB-MP401Air (similar M2)</a></p></li><li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ariic-AirMusic-AirPlay-receiver-Android/dp/B00ID1H7G8/ref=redir_mobile_desktop?ie=UTF8&amp;ref_=aw_cr_t_electronics">Interesting amazon review</a><br /><a href="http://sonoe.strikingly.com/">Sonoe Ieast</a> A lot of additional features, dedicated phones apps.

I would like to swith on my old JBL station or my pioneer VSX AMP. With an ESP8266 if I arrive to execute an URL on the NW11 when something is streamed it could be possible to make it.

Finaly may be it is possible to make the same test without creating a new firmware, I mean is it possible to launch this binary on the old original M2 firmware ? <br />edit: I put the bin file on my M2 with wget but when I run it I can read <span style="color: blue">squeezelite-mips-ar71xx: can&#039;t load library &#039;libasound.so.2&#039;</span> , OK a library is missing... I tried <span style="color: blue">opkg install alsa-lib</span> but <span style="color: blue">opkg: not found </span>.
