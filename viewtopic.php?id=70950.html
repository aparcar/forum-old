					<p>Hello friends,</p><p>When trying to install the new firmware of the router TP-LINK archer C50, something has happened and it does not turn on anymore, it only lights up the red internet LED and nothing else, I have no answer on the network ports, and no ping. Wanted to know how to re-write the router&#039;s firmware, what am I going to need to buy?</p><p>All help and welcome and thanks to all for the help</p>									</div>

The only way out is to re-program the flash chip using a SPI flash programmer, download the firmware from the tplink site, then download dd and run dd if=fw.bin of=uboot.bin skip=512 bs=1 count=64k in the folder where you saved the firmware(rename the firmware to fw.bin), use the SPI flash programmer to write the generated uboot.bin to adress 000000-010000 on the flash(but don&#039;t erase the whole flash, only the first 64kb of it - 000000-010000 hex), then use the TFTP method carefully to re-write the firmware,</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>user5077</strong> on 21 May 2017, 10:39)</p>

					<p>Read again, TFTP/serial will NOT work, because bootloader is dead, you could only use a SPI programmer to reflash it. Otherwise, throw away the router as there&#039;s no other way out.</p>									</div>
