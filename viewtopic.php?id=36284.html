					<p>after trying for hours since yesterday i&#039;m totally frustrated...</p><p>Here&#039;s my Layout:</p><p>DSL Modem (DLink 321B) &lt;-&gt; OpenWRT Router with BackFire (Netgear WNDR3800, 4 eth0 ports + 1 wan) &lt;-&gt; Switch &lt;-&gt; Clients</p><p>I get access to WAN with modem in bridge mode and entering all the ppoe stuff in the wan-section in /etc/config/network.&nbsp; </p><p>Now i want the modem NOT in bridge mode, so i can switch the adsl modem with a cable modem for example without changing any setting in my router.</p><p>But i can&#039;t get it to work <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> My Modem has access to the Internet, but i cannot ping outside from my router.</p><p>What&#039;s the proper setting in /etc/config/network for this, i think it&#039;s not that complicated but i&#039;m stuck here <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>thanks ahead!</p><p>restes</p>									</div>

Today, several websites and a number of other applications in industries, such as corporate, retail, radio and restaurant, music is widely used to both entertain and<a href="http://www.dayomusic.com/">free mp3 music</a>retain customers or clients. This is where royalty free music comes into picture. Many people are still not aware of this term and those who are, are taking full advantage of it in their productions.

					<p>What happens when you plug your PC into the modemdirectly ? What IP do you get assigned? Does it work?<br />What happens when you plug the OpenWrt router? What IP is assigned to wan? When it’s assigned, paste ifconfig.</p><p>I’m surprised it assigns 192.168.1.1 to the router. That doesn’t sound very likely. wan and the modem have to be in one subnet, lan has to be another subnet.</p>									</div>
