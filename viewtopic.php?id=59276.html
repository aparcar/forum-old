					<p>Hi all!</p><p>In general I&#039; want to connect a SMART TV to my home WLAN network (Fritzbox).</p><p>Unfortunately the TV is only equiped with one LAN interface. So I&#039;m using a small OpenWRT router (Alfa AP121) to get the TV connected to WLAN.</p><p>For this I connect the Wifi of OpenWRT router to Fritzbox WLAN in client mode, set a fixed IP for TV and OpenWRT router LAN port. But finally it was not possible to get access to the TV (Ping from PC connected to Fritzbox to TV) or get internet access on TV.</p><p>Can anybody help please?</p>									</div>

					<p>First you need to check if your OpenWRT router has internet access.</p><p>Connect your PC/Notebook to the router, do wifi configurations and then test if you can reach youtube using the ethernet cable.

					<p>I think you wan the following:&nbsp; TV to AP121 by cable, AP121 to Fritbox by wireless, same subnet.</p><p>The AP121 is an Atheros chip set.&nbsp; If you want to be able to do a Bridged Client setup, you probably need to read this and probably need to do relayd.&nbsp; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/bridgedclient">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/bridgedclient</a>&nbsp; Also read the link in the wiki for &quot;Bridged Client Mode Issues&quot;</p><p>Alternatively, if you are willing to dedicated the wireless to the ONE connection to the main router and NOT connect other wireless clients to the AP121, this MIGHT work.&nbsp; This will give you an ETHERNET connection to the TV (or a switch for additional devices).&nbsp; You can connect to the AP121 from the Fritzbox wireless, but not directly other than Ethernet. </p><p>I do not know what a Fritzbox is or if it&#039;s running OpenWRT.&nbsp; It should not matter, but does depend on how/where fixed IP is assigned in relation to the DHCP range (in or out of it).&nbsp; I will assume it allows Fixed IP like OpenWRT , outside of the range.&nbsp; Do not use a static IP on the Fritzbox for the AP121.</p><p>Assume your Fritzbox router is 192.168.1.1 and your DHCP is 192.168.1.100-150,<br />Connect PC directly (Cable) to AP121 and set the AP121 to a fixed IP address of 192.168.1.3 (outside DHCP and not the router IP), save apply. Reboot. You probably will need to manually set the IP on your PC to something else in the same subnet.<br />Log back in to new address, Disable DHCP for the LAN.&nbsp; Save and apply. (Ignore all WAN settings)<br />Check to see that you have the LAN (Ethernet) bridged to your WLAN. <br />At this point you should be able to go to WIFI and Scan for the Wireless connection on your Fritzbox.&nbsp; Do not create a new interface. (off by default, meaning check box is on).&nbsp; <br />Try the internet.<br />If you have issues reboot and check again.&nbsp; <br />If this does not work change your AP121 fixed ip to one at the backend of the Fritzbox IP range. (Caveat above)<br />Check to see that your TV is set to DHCP and not fixed IP.<br />If you have Internet from the PC connected tot he AP121, you can then move the cable to the TV and things should work. You may need to go into the TV and &quot;kick&quot; the DHCP scan.<br />IF this works, and you want, you can assign a static IP to the TV on your Fritzbox.<br />If this does not work, I probably can not help you more with this method, and you will need to go to the Wiki setup above... or buy a broadcom or powerline device.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think relayd has some limitations.&nbsp; The article also said to use WDS over relayd if possible.&nbsp; Also the solution I proposed does not use relayd.&nbsp; Did you try it?</p><p>I do not know what &quot;configuration tool&quot; you are using, but check if you can to see if it is using broadcast or IP, and see if this is a relayd issue.&nbsp; I do not know.</p><p>I found relayd unreliable to use.&nbsp; I added a second radio via USB so I did not need to deal with the problem.</p>									</div>

					<p>RangerZ,</p><p>the device is using atheros. So your proposed solution would be: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds</a></p><p>Correct?</p><p>Problem is that the access point also must be configured for WDS. And this is not possible with my router.</p><p>And reguarding the used configuration tool... My application is a little bit more complicated as just connecting a TV. But it is nearly the same and for my first post it was the simplest was to describe my problem. <br />Reality is that I want to connect a wired PLC and the configuration tool is the programming tool for the PLC. But I think this is to much in detail.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Aquadukt</strong> on 30 Aug 2015, 22:31)</p>

					<p>I really did not expect WDS to work&nbsp; Same problem here.&nbsp; Too many platforms.&nbsp; </p><p>You never stated if you needed the ability to connect other devices wirelessly to the APA 121 or not.&nbsp; If not then try the other solution I offered as it does not use relayd.&nbsp; If your device is a 121U (usb) you can add a wireless USB adapter (I use the EDIMAX 7811) and also eliminate relayd, and then use the device as both an AP and client.</p><p>I think the unit has 2 Ethernet ports, so you could reconfigure the second (I assume it&#039;s WAN) to LAN, and maybe connect your device there.</p>									</div>

					<p>The device is without USB.</p><p>The option with Relayd now seems to work expect of the scannfunction (think this is based on MAC addresses). So I think the solution &quot;Atheros and MAC80211 WDS&quot; (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds#the_access_point">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/ath … cess_point</a>) would be work, because it is described with &quot;layer 2 transparent bridge&quot;.</p><br /><p>I already tried this solution, but is was not possible to connect the WLAN. <br />Now, after uninstalling the OpenWRT component &quot;wpad.mini&quot; and install &quot;wpad&quot; this is possible. WLAN connects successfully in &quot;Client WDS&quot; mode. All further configuration on client was done by me like the linked recipes above. </p><p>Everithing loogs good, but it does not work <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />Also I&#039;m wondering about, that I configure my LAN interface for DHCP, but the interface will not get an IP by DHCP.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Aquadukt</strong> on 1 Sep 2015, 07:26)</p>

					<p>It sounds like you are in territory that I can not help you much with.</p><p>Regarding setting a fixed IP or using DHCP on the AP121.&nbsp; If you set a fixed IP for the device in the LAN subnet you can always have an IP that you can connect to on the device&#039;s Ethernet cable (LAN side).&nbsp; If you have the device get an IP from the Fritzbox then the device may not always have an IP or the IP mat vary.&nbsp; Manually setting the IP guarantees you a IP to connect to.</p>									</div>

					<p>WDS unfortunately is not longer a option, because I learned now, this is not supported by most of regular routers. So I will try to keep a brigde with relad.</p><p>In general the bridge is now working. I have done the set up like this description:<br /><a href="http://cavebeat.blogspot.de/2012/08/openwrt-bridge-with-relayd-pseudobridge.html">http://cavebeat.blogspot.de/2012/08/ope … ridge.html</a></p><p>The problem with scanner/broadcast functions is still existing.
