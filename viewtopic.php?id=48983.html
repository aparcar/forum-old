					<p>Hello, noob here. </p><p>Bricked my TL-WDR3600 in the attempt to flash it back to stockFW. I would now appreciate if someone went through with me if there is anything I can salvage without soldering. I am comfortable with trying that, but only if I have to.</p><p>Here&#039;s what I did:<br />Had the WDR3600&nbsp; working under Barrier Breaker built 140209. </p><p>Downloaded wdr3600v1_en_3_13_31_up(130320).bin from TP-Link&#039;s website, put it under /tmp/tplink.bin<br />Checked that the file had exactly 8126464 bytes.<br />Executed <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> mtd -r write /tmp/tplink.bin firmware</code></pre></div><p>Console said it was writing and then rebooting.</p><p>Waited, but couldn&#039;t get back in. Only the LAN and the Power LED are lit, the star-led stays dark. </p><p>Did a 30/30/30 reset, but that only led to a lit WDS-Led (the two arrows). </p><p>Hints? Thx in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>thanks, that was swift.</p><p>I presume, however, that this doesn&#039;t apply to my case, or does it? <br />Following the instructions I specifically did not use the latest FW for the WDR3600 which has a &quot;boot&quot; in its filename and is longer than the magic 8126464 bytes. The quoted fw for the 4300 also has &quot;boot&quot; in its filename. </p><p>What would I do if I had firmware recovery mode?</p><p>edit: just followed this here <br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=38953">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=38953</a><br />as advised in the post linked above. There is life in the box and it asks for the recovery file, magic!</p><p>Will now set up that tftp server. Question only which FW should I try: the latest with &quot;boot&quot; or an earlier without?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ElFishi</strong> on 14 Feb 2014, 21:04)</p>

					<p>awright - too late<br />I was too eager and tried the&nbsp; last one with boot, only to watch the leds blink for 45min.</p><p>will now try the one but last w/o boot. Save the hassle trimming.</p>									</div>

					<p>I am back in business again! Thanks for the hint.</p><p>What have I done precisely: </p><p>In contrast to the &quot;[HOWTO] Unbrick TP-Link...&quot; I was able to pick up the messages <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> Who has 192.168.0.66? Tell 192.168.0.86</code></pre></div><p>on the LAN port, not on the WAN port. Also note the .0. instead of the .1. described. </p><p>As mentioned above, the latest FW TL-WDR3600_V1_130909.zip contains a &quot;boot&quot; file and does not work when sent over by TFTP.<br />Instead I used TL-WDR3600_V1_130129.zip. This procedure took few mins and was successful. </p><p>I then used the webinterface to flash the router to the latest FW, also successful. </p><p>Cheers!</p>									</div>
