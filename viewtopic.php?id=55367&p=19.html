What you need to do is make sure you have a brcmfmac which uses a table to translate country code, if that table doesn&#039;t exist the country code will not be configured, and that is what we ultimately want. Then you load the original Netgear firmware for the R8000, use the GUI to change the country code to the desired code. Then reload the openwrt image and voila you&#039;re done. The country code will be the correct one. As you don&#039;t need to (and are officially not allowed to) change the country code, this procedure needs to be done only once.</p></blockquote></div><p>What about creating a custom region database where region 00 lists the frequencies appropriate to my locality?

					<p>Hello!</p><p>The R8000 died while trying to flash (not me).<br />Going around, the bootloader is killed: only the power LED is on, nothing is output to the console, no network activity, including TFTP, etc.<br />I am looking for a way to flash FLASH via JTAG. Is there data on the pinout? Judging by the proximity to SoC, it is he:<br /><a href="https://ibb.co/hAK1uG"><span class="postimg"><img src="https://thumb.ibb.co/hAK1uG/2018_01_28_11_26_19.jpg" alt="https://thumb.ibb.co/hAK1uG/2018_01_28_11_26_19.jpg" /></span></a></p><p>P.S.: restored by desoldering FLASH and programmer.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ABATAPA</strong> on 16 Apr 2018, 10:49)</p>
