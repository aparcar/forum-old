					<p>I have to be honest and tell you I have no idea which firmware is on it at this point (I assume none since it&#039;s in this state).&nbsp; I bricked it a few weeks ago and immediately went out and bought a new one because it&#039;s fairly critical for my work.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t get a chance to look at it until a couple days ago, and by now the files I used to flash it and my memory of what exactly happened are gone.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure what trimming the uboot means. The firmware I&#039;m trying to load onto it is &quot;mr3020nv1_en_3_17_1_up_boot(130929).bin&quot; (renamed to &quot;mr3020v1_tp_recovery.bin&quot;).&nbsp; The main reason I was looking into OpenWRT was because the stock firmware has no QOS, and on a lackluster 3G connection that is shared that REALLY would be helpful.&nbsp; Unfortunately, OpenWRT didn&#039;t seem to like my modem.</p><p>I quite like these devices.&nbsp; I have a third one running a Piratebox.</p>									</div>

					<p>What would be the correct&nbsp; position of the switch? AP mode (Access point) or are the switches taken out of the OpenWRT functionality?</p><p>My new 3020 works perfect when directly connected to the WAN or a NULL cable to my PC. when connected as an output of another modem (WAN/LAN mixing?) all seems to work fine but&nbsp; I&#039;m lost in finding admin access somewhere.I assumed that the range from the 3020 offered would have one IP address assigned to this. Any pointers how this can be found?</p><p>Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>peterv999</strong> on 15 Mar 2014, 16:43)</p>

					<p>Hi peterv999 your post misses some critical information.</p><p>let us know some background information about your environment:<br />-What&#039;s your ISP addressing method and connection/authentication? (DHCP/Fixed IP, DSL/PPPoE/etc)<br />-what are the detected address/gateway/dns in your machine? (runs ipconfig/ifconfig)<br />-what&#039;s your prefered OS (to provide the right commands to tests)?</p><p>By the way, your router should be acessible by 192.168.1.1, but prior to that you need to manually configure it to stay on address 192.168.1.2 with the mask 255.255.255.0, thisshould get you directly to Luci interface.</p><p>Let us hear back from you.</p>									</div>

					<p>hello,</p><p>well first of all it was on openwrt attitude.<br />i wanted to return it to tp-link firmware so i&#039;ve connected it on my computer launch a ssh connection then typed the following command<br /> wget <a href="http://www.tp-link.com/Resources/software/TL-MR3020_V1_120320.zip">http://www.tp-link.com/Resources/softwa … 120320.zip</a><br /> unzip TL-MR3020*.zip<br /> mtd -r write mr3020*up*.bin firmware<br />after that he has rebooted and instead of getting lan led with activity and power led, i just have power led on.<br />i&#039;ve tried to ping it with ip 192.168.0.254 since he must be on tp-link configuration but responce from it i&#039;ve reconfigured my computer ip to ping it on 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.254 but still no response.<br />I&#039;ve try the failsafe mode of openwrt no sign of activity same for reset of tplink.</p><p>here the result of &quot;tcpdump -Ani eth0 port 4919 and udp&quot; on 192.168.1.0 and 192.168.0.0 by the way result after 10mn on both</p><p>tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode<br />listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 65535 bytes<br />^C<br />0 packets captured<br />0 packets received by filter<br />0 packets dropped by kernel</p><p>i think that i&#039;ve flashed the bad firmware TL-MR3020_V1_120320 on my mr3020 that hw v1.8 (opened it after the flash operation) or may be because i don&#039;t have switched to wisp prior to flash it.</p><p>so i just wanted to know if the only way to save it is with serial console because if not, it&#039;s useless that i buy a usb ttl.</p>									</div>
