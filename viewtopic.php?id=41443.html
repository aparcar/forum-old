					<p>Following setup with two routers, first is a Fritz!Box-Derivative, second is a OpenWrt-powered Router:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://wiki.openwrt.org/_media/doc/howto/802.3-double-nating.png" alt="http://wiki.openwrt.org/_media/doc/howto/802.3-double-nating.png" /></span></p><p>Everything works.</p><p>Now when I disable NATing on the OpenWrt-Router, the hosts behind it, cannot connect to the FritzBox nor to the Internet. The OpenWrt-Box can connect to the FritzBox and to the Internet. This is due to the NATing done in the FritzBox-Derivative.</p><p>Does anybody have an idea, howto solve this issue?</p><p>As described here: <a href="http://freetz.org/wiki/packages/iptables.en">http://freetz.org/wiki/packages/iptables.en</a> NAT is done by dsld and test with tcpdump done on the OpenWrt-Box, suggest, the FritzBox refuses to NAT unknown IP-addresses. I.e. even if 192.168.2.1 sends packets to openwrt.org, the response-packets are NATed to 192.168.1.50 and not to 192.168.2.1.</p><p>Out of curiosity: in case Router-No1 was an OpenWrt-device as well, following configuration should work, right?:<br />iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o $dsl-interface -j MASQUERADE</p>									</div>

					<p>The firewall is on the OpenWrt-box is not the problem. The problem is, that I cannot get the static routing entries into theAlice IAD! Frustrating. Also, every time I test a setting, I have to copy the entire configartion onto my harddis, edit it there, insert a line that tells that fracking frmware to not calculate hash, then upload it to the IAD and REBOOT the entire thing. Takes about 2 minutes.</p><p>FritzBox does not have NVRAM, but something very similar. Once you got used to OpenWrt, this is REAAAALY a royal PITA.</p>									</div>
