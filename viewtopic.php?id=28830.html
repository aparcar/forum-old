					<p>If you mean that I should download the source and build the SDK, as I said it creates an &quot;sdk&quot; folder in target that doesn&#039;t function as the SDK is said to work. I&#039;ve worked with a mips SDK and you put the package in &quot;package&quot; and make from the root of the SDK. The build SDK doesn&#039;t do that. </p><p>If you mean that I should just put my package in the backfire/packages folder, that doesn&#039;t work because certain headers just aren&#039;t there when building.</p><p>Redownloaded everything from svn and rebuilt OpenWRT. SDK is available in the bin directory. Not sure why it was not building previously.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>napierzaza</strong> on 27 Feb 2011, 02:15)</p>
