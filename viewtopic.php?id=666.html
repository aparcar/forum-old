					<p>Hi all. I&#039;m a developer of wifiadmin, a GPL project aiming to create a web interface in PHP for any wireless extensions enabled driver.</p><p>I wonder if wifiadmin could be intergated into OpenWRT, so as to act as its web interface. </p><p>Wifiadmin is written in PHP4, it is 30something kilobytes tar.gzed and runs with minimun installation effort. We have been developing for about a year now, and the project has reached a certain level of maturity.</p><p>Our homepage can be found <a href="http://wifiadmin.sourceforge.net/">here</a>. It would be nice to see the two projects work together! I must say of course that am a newbe in the WRT world, since our wireless nodes are usually old PCs with pci cards(and wifiadmin).</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi InDio,</p><p>WifiAdmin looks like an excellent project - very nice work indeed.&nbsp; It&#039;s projects like yours that will help to make Community Wireless networks more accessable to a wider user-base, which can only help their growth and popularity.</p><p>The Wireless-Tools package is supported under OpenWRT, but unfortunately, the driver for the WRT54G&#039;s wireless interface is proprietary and hasn&#039;t been fully reverse-engineered.&nbsp; So not all features of Wireless-Tools work on the WRT54G.&nbsp; For full control, you need to use the proprietary &#039;wl&#039; userspace app.&nbsp; &#039;wl&#039; is available as a package for OpenWRT.</p><p>There is an existing web-interface package for OpenWRT - it used to be PHP-based but it has been converted to use Ash-scriping to save space.&nbsp; The web-interface is modular and allows add-on interface packages through the use of style-sheets.</p><p>I must say though, the screenshots of the WifiAdmin interface look very nice indeed.&nbsp; I would be happy to sacrifice the extra space required by PHP if it meant I could use your interface on a WRT54GS. (which has 6Mb of writable space under OpenWRT).</p><p>If you are able to deal with the limitations of the embedded environment that is OpenWRT, I&#039;m sure many OpenWRT users would greatly appreciate an OpenWRT version of WifiAdmin.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you danversj for your encouraging comments!! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" />&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /> We have been developing for about a year, and since our last 0.0.2 release, which adds loads of features, we&#039;ve had little user feedback.</p><p>If WRT fully supported wireless extensions, given a PHP-aware httpd, porting <a href="http://wifiadmin.sourceforge.net">Wifiadmin</a> to the WRT environmet would be a matter of a few hours. Given the circumstances though, we are facing great difficulty. Also consider the fact that we must port to an environment that we do not have access to <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />, at least at the moment. </p><p>Further suggestions are welcome! It would be nice to at least have an idea on the need for a web interface in the OpenWRT community, so that we can proceed with developing a port....</p><p>With some quick calculations, I can say that wifiadmin, WITH the support for RRDTool that will create graphs of various information, will take up to 500k of space.<br />Is there any chance that rrdtool can run in OpenWRT?</p>									</div>

					<p>The function of wifiadmin are looking great, but it will be hard to marriage.&nbsp; I got the sources and would try to install it (first of all I need a NFS_share at /www/cgi-bin ;-)). <br />Please send me your email.
