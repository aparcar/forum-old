					<p>Hi World,</p><p>For the most part, my RT3352 module is running great.I would like to discuss one issue coming in RT3352 module.</p><p>Driver - Rawlink (rt2800)<br />Chipset - Mediatek</p><p>STA floods QoS data and AP sent ACK for this within 2us But after AP is sending ack, still STA is retransmitting Qos data frames with retry bit set. I paste some Sniffer capture for more clarity.</p><p>I checked in driver code Duration to get ACK set to 202us, according to this ACK is coming within 202us still STA re-transmitting the QOS data frame.<br />On further analysis in driver side, I analyzed that QoS data frames are given only once from driver to firmware, and i am not aware from where RT3352 module loads Firmware Image or it is inbuilt on RT3352 SOC.</p><p>37574&nbsp; &nbsp; 150.167582&nbsp; &nbsp; 00:25:f0:6f:76:57&nbsp; &nbsp; 8c:f5:a3:88:76:87&nbsp; &nbsp; 802.11&nbsp; &nbsp; 358&nbsp; &nbsp; Frame is not being retransmitted&nbsp; &nbsp; 11&nbsp; &nbsp; QoS Data, SN=358, FN=0, Flags=.p.....TC</p><p>37575&nbsp; &nbsp; 150.167584&nbsp; &nbsp; 00:25:f0:6f:76:57 (RA)&nbsp; &nbsp; 802.11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Frame is not being retransmitted&nbsp; &nbsp; 11&nbsp; &nbsp; Acknowledgement, Flags=........C</p><p>37579&nbsp; &nbsp; 150.182377&nbsp; &nbsp; 00:25:f0:6f:76:57&nbsp; &nbsp; 8c:f5:a3:88:76:87&nbsp; &nbsp; 802.11&nbsp; &nbsp; 358&nbsp; &nbsp; Frame is being retransmitted&nbsp; &nbsp; 2&nbsp; &nbsp; QoS Data, SN=358, FN=0, Flags=.p..R..TC</p><p>37580&nbsp; &nbsp; 150.195149&nbsp; &nbsp; SugaElec_6f:76:57&nbsp; &nbsp; 8c:f5:a3:88:76:87&nbsp; &nbsp; 802.11&nbsp; &nbsp; 358&nbsp; &nbsp; Frame is being retransmitted&nbsp; &nbsp; 1&nbsp; &nbsp; QoS Data, SN=358, FN=0, Flags=.p..R..TC</p><p>37581&nbsp; &nbsp; 150.195444&nbsp; &nbsp; 00:25:f0:6f:76:57 (RA)&nbsp; &nbsp; 802.11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Frame is not being retransmitted&nbsp; &nbsp; 1&nbsp; &nbsp; Acknowledgement, Flags=........C</p><p>Can it be possible to Fix this Issue in driver? </p><p>I appreciate your response, insight and help.
