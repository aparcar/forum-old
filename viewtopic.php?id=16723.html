					<p>I was able to run revision 11276 (about 2 months ago) with default kernel 2.6.23.17. It was running quite stable on WRT54GL v1.1.</p><p>Is there any revision known to work with kernel 2.6.25 on my HW? Or maybe there are some &quot;suspected working&quot; revisions? I&#039;m eager to test them, if necessary.</p><p>Acoul: thanks for info, but as I said, revision 11276/kernel 2.6.23.17 is working on my HW. That other topic mentions trunk version 6563.
