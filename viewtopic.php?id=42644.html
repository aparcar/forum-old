					<p>How sure are you that your snapshot and the packages are from the same build ?</p><p>The trunk snapshot builds gets rebuilt automatically every&nbsp; day or two&nbsp; &nbsp;so even if you install an image today and then try to install packages tomorrow it may not work (i use the waffley &quot;may&quot; because i don&#039;t know if the signatures on the kernel package change with every build just because of timestamps and such or if it actually means something has changed).&nbsp; &nbsp; That&#039;s an annoyance of working w/ trunk.&nbsp; &nbsp; One way around it is to download the 300MB ImageBuilder archive&nbsp; or just download a snapshot of the packages dir when you install an image you know you&#039;re going to upgrade to.&nbsp; (or, if you are a linux developer/admin type and are so inclined to build your own stuff from source.&nbsp; The ar71xx built quite cleanly for me (though you need to download a few hundred meg of source and&nbsp; need about 6 or 7 GB of disk space) )</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello vhm,<br />I&#039;m realy sure to use the snapshots and packages from the same build. Because I made the sysupgrade with one hour after download the sysupgrade files.<br />I think the best way for me is to make a complete upgrade of the system over tftp. In the last time I used the function for upgrade within LuCI.<br />Can I get the files from the packages over ftp?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Rather than going in for weirder stuff... i&#039;d say just try your sysupgrade again.</p><p>One thing that suggests that things aren&#039;t exactly how you think they are is that about 24hours ago you said that you used the latest snapshot, but r35673&nbsp; was checked in a good 2 weeks ago on 2/19.</p><p>Checking out the build bot output shows that there have already been several snapshots that are newer:<br /><a href="http://buildbot.openwrt.org:8010/builders/ar71xx">http://buildbot.openwrt.org:8010/builders/ar71xx</a></p><p>2/25/2013&nbsp; was already 35770</p><p>Anyway... there are other ways you can do things, some listed here <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.sysupgrade">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.sysupgrade</a> </p><p>You CAN also download the ipk files and unpack them etc. but the kernel and modules also have version checking internally (in addition to what ipk does for all packages) so the insmod will likely fail.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello vhm,<br />I repeated the sysupgrade and now everything is going well.<br />On the way to that result I made the upgrade yesterday and today I had the known error with no sockets bound after the installation of luci. With the manual configuration of uhttp to port 80 I got the connection to Luci. After that I have installed the kmod for the usb printer successfully.<br />Now I have the revision r35847 running.</p><p>Thanks again for your helpful info, vhm</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Christian.Truee</strong> on 4 Mar 2013, 23:38)</p>
