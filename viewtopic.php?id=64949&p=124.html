I&#039;ve been following the OpenWRT, then LEDE and now David&#039;s builds for a while. Yesterday, I decided to take the plunge. Note: I&#039;m a long-time DD-WRT user who wants to switch permanently to LEDE. I have a <strong>WRT1900ACv1</strong>. And somehow no OpenWRT or LEDE build is giving me (stable) WiFi <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> The WiFi would either come on for a few seconds and then turn off on its own. Or it would stay on, and no devices would be able to connect. So, I&#039;m stuck with DD-WRT (or McDebian, which runs flawless as well). The funniest is that the router&#039;s never rebooted on me even once! (using the 4.9.x kernels)</p><p>Here&#039;s where/how things get murky across builds:<br /><strong>1. DD-WRT 07-08-2017-r32597</strong> (Kernel 4.9.38)<br />-No reboots (last I had 8+ days uptime before I attempted @David&#039;s LEDE last night)<br />-Currently on 07-19-2017-r32753 and a solid 7+ hours uptime since I rebooted it last night post re-flash of DD-WRT when LEDE didn&#039;t work out.</p><p><strong>2. LEDE/OpenWRT/David&#039;s LEDE</strong> (Used Kernels: 4.9.x as well as 4.4.x)<br />-Tried all three builds, and both kernel versions, but WiFi (both N as well as AC) is a non-starter right out the gate. I am lost as to why this is happening.</p><p><strong>3. Notable mention: McDebian</strong> (Kernel:4.9.31)<br />-Flawless, just like DD-WRT (and no reboots here either)<br />-Unfortunately it isn&#039;t as frequently updated like the other two, so it&#039;s my backup <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p><span class="bbu">Router load:</span><br /><strong>1. WiFi AC</strong><br />- 1 smartphone<br />- 1 laptop<br /><strong>2. WiFi N</strong><br />- 2 smartphones<br />- 2 tablets<br />- 1 laptop<br />- 1 Amazon Fire Stick<br /><strong>3. Ethernet</strong><br />- 1 desktop<br />- 1 NAS<br />- 1 XBOX ONE</p><p><strong>Total devices handled:</strong> 11<br /><strong>Average devices powered and utilizing the network simultaneously:</strong> 6 (roughly 4 on WiFi, 2 over Ethernet)<br /><strong>Average temps observed:</strong> 69C - 74C (Oddly, while the fan does its spin cycle on power up, I have never seen it turn on any of the above builds for my temperature range. Hope that&#039;s normal - on any of the builds, I don&#039;t change the fan thresholds).</p><p>Last note: When erasing the NAND partitions (mtdX) for McDebian, mtd4 and mtd6 gave me a &quot;bad block&quot; warning, but proceeded to erase successfully and the router has be rock stable as noted above, barring allergy to LEDE/OpenWRT.</p><p>Any insights would be wonderful. I really love LEDE/OpenWRT from a technical standpoint, but my router won&#039;t let me switch <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>Thanks much in advance!</p></blockquote></div><p>@smmankad</p><p>There&#039;s really no 1 thing to point at.&nbsp; If there is no issue and things are good, then there&#039;s no reason to switch. Stay with what works for you and your device.</p><p>Best Regards,</p></blockquote></div><p>Thank you, @David. It still bugs me though, as to why its so <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> Can flashing through USB TTL make any difference? I don&#039;t see how it would, but I noted a couple of posts over in the main 1900AC thread claiming its &quot;better&quot;. I usually prefer not opening up the device unless I actually bricked it.</p><p>Anyhoo - I guess I will stick to DD-WRT (and keep trying LEDE in between to see if I find a (future) build that begins working for me).</p><p>I really appreciate the awesome work that goes on around 3rd party FW.</p></blockquote></div><p>Finally, its working! I was checking some very unnecessary checkboxes when setting up WiFi (my bad, totally).</p><p>Follow-up question/observation:<br />-When I revert to stock using the Advance Reboot (or the SSH command equivalents), I am unable to get DHCP over Ethernet (WiFi works fine). Is that why back to stock must always be done via sysupgrade -n ? (Does the &#039;-n&#039; do a deeper reset of configs?)<br />-When I revert using Advance Reboot, and flash stock from stock (overwriting LEDE), same thing happens - no eth DHCP. Its like once you put LEDE, it doesn&#039;t want you to go back. (DDWRT also exhibits same behavior as stock in terms of no DHCP over eth).</p>									</div>

  swconfig dev switch0 port $port set qmode 0 
  swconfig dev switch0 port $port set pvid 0 
done</code></pre></div><p>c) Run vlan.sh:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>chmod ./vlan.sh +x ; ./vlan.sh</code></pre></div><p>Taken from <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt_ac_series">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt_ac_series</a></p><p>And yes, -n makes it not save the current config, so it is a clean install.&nbsp; But even -n won&#039;t fix the above when reverting to stock Linksys firmware.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>starcms</strong> on 17 Aug 2017, 11:28)</p>
