					<p>Hi @ldpinney I&#039;m keen to use your bootloader with my 3700v5. If anything goes wrong with my custom build of LEDE then I&#039;ve got nice options to recover that don&#039;t involve running a Windows XP utility. I couldn&#039;t find documentation on this but it is possible to manipulate uboot startup options using sequences of the 3700v5 reset button instead requiring serial access and taking the router apart? In your other bootloaders you have these options below. Thank you for your work on this.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Press and hold reset button to run:
Web server (min. 3 seconds)
U-Boot serial console (min. 5 seconds)
U-Boot network console (min. 7 seconds)</code></pre></div>									</div>

					<p>@ldpinney You do realize that at this moment I could kiss you, don&#039;t you? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /> Thanks for the image and the advice.</p><p>Succesful boot after de-/resoldering and programming the chip! I used a paint-stripper heat gun with a very coarse scale from 100-600 degrees Celcius for removing the chip, a 2€ programmer from AliExpress and both the heat gun and a soldering iron for resoldering the chip. Took me hours to get to grips with all the steps, 15 minutes for writing, 15 for veryfying. I am a very happy person, right now: Working router and I now know how to program flash chips!</p><p>Hints for people who thoroughly bricked their router:</p><ul><li><p>Don&#039;t worry. You can reprogram the chip with a CH341A Mini Programmer. If you don&#039;t wan&#039;t to solder: Use a clip</p></li><li><p>If you decide to solder using a heat gun: </p><ul><li><p>I used aluminium tape (used in plumbing) to cover half of the PCB. If some part gets desoldered too, than it stays in place and gets resoldered when cooling down.</p></li><li><p>Take the PCB out of the plastic casing. (I didn&#039;t and some of the plastic support of the antenna is deformed.)</p></li><li><p>Keep the chip in place with aluminium tape: It keeps it somewhat cooler, but most importantly it isn&#039;t pushed away by the air flow from the heat gun.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Don&#039;t worry about damaging the chip. It seems very robust after using the heat gun and a soldering iron on it. When damaged: You can buy 5 others for 5€ on AliExpress.</p></li><li><p>Before programming the chip: Erase the chip, check whether it&#039;s blank and then reprogram it.</p></li></ul><p>If I ever get allowed to post images, I&#039;ll post some snapshots.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Markismus</strong> on 14 Feb 2017, 23:52)</p>

If Sercom Updater crashed at 99% when flashing LEDE, it will boot successfully but you won&#039;t be able to save any changes (they are lost after each reboot). You can fix it by flashing LEDE again via standard sysupgrade.</p><p>2. If Sercom Updater crashed at 99% when flashing stock firmware, the router is soft bricked. However it will start TFTP server after restart - automatically, you don&#039;t have to do any tricks. Then you can flash stock firmware again using standard TFTP instructions.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pamelus</strong> on 17 Mar 2017, 22:41)</p>
