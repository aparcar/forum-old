					<p>I can&#039;t find the gpio for this button.&nbsp; Does anyone know it?&nbsp; I found all the LEDs and the bridge switch and reset, but I can&#039;t find the AOSS.&nbsp; Looking through the web I see the suggestion that this is gpio 0.&nbsp; This doesn&#039;t do anything for me either with a diagnostic hotplug script (that outputs log messages; this works with the other two buttons), or by using the gpio utility (which I have manually polled up to 31)</p><p>Can someone confirm that they have used this button successfully, and that it is on gpio 0?&nbsp; Or whatever it is really on?</p>									</div>
