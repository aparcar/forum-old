					<p>Hello all!</p><p>I would like to ask to the main developers of OpenWRT if it would be possible to add to the trunk, the Python 3.2.3 support as a package, if possible! I believe this would help a lot of people!</p><p>CyBjit provided to me as an answer to <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=168118">this post</a> I opened, requesting help to cross-compiling Python 3 for the Gateworks Cambria GW2358-4 with OpenWRT.</p><p><a href="https://gitorious.org/openwrt-cybjit/openwrt-cybjit-packages/commit/2d542ecef324fe165fcd1b4063876a9f1e6096e4/">In Here</a>, CyBjit provides the proper package Makefiles for a correct compilation of Python 3.2.3 for OpenWRT. I installed it and it seems to work!</p>									</div>

					<p>I did not notice values above normal, but for something specific, you gona have to try it out...<br />Also, the binaries are relatively small and when compared to python 2.7, they have relatively the same size (1.7MB aprox).</p>									</div>
