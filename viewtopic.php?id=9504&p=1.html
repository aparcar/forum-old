					<p>Thanks alot for your work, forum2006! </p><p>I noticed that the x86-2.6_vt.patch cannot be applied any more due to some changes in the kamikaze&#039;s subversion. Anyway, I could update the patch. I also created <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/RunningKamikazeOnVMwareHowTo">http://wiki.openwrt.org/RunningKamikazeOnVMwareHowTo</a> where the two resulting patches are linked. I think a wiki fits better the nature of a HowTo. I also linked a later kamikaze build there together with the vmx config file. </p><p>Feel free to update that page.</p>									</div>

					<p>VMware ESX Server</p><p>It is possible to run OpenWrt on ESX server as well but it adds a few steps and complications in the compile process.&nbsp; Let us try to brake them down in easy to follow steps that someone may be willing to add to the wiki:</p><p>1. Enable SCSI support in the kernel through the standard menuconfig interface (using &#039;y&#039;es and not as a &#039;m&#039;odule).&nbsp; Enable the network kmod-e1000 driver, using the same method (again, not as a module).</p><p>2. Open the file target/linux/x86-2.6/config in an editor.&nbsp; Go to line number 319.&nbsp; Insert the two lines &#039;CONFIG_SCSI_BUSLOGIC=&quot;y&quot;&#039; and below that &#039;CONFIG_SCSI=&quot;y&quot;&#039;&quot;.&nbsp; Save and close the file.</p><p>3. Open &quot;.config&quot; in the root build directory.&nbsp; Search for the parameter &quot;CONFIG_X86_GRUB_ROOTPART&quot;.&nbsp; Change it to read &quot;CONFIG_X86_GRUB_ROOTPART=&quot;/dev/sda2&quot;. </p><p>4. Make the kernel with make parameter V=99, just in case oldconfig/prepare needs input.&nbsp; Accept the defaults by pressing enter if it does ask.</p><p>5. Convert the image file as above by running &quot;qemu-img convert -f raw bin/openwrt-x86-2.6-ext2.image -O vmdk bin/openwrt-x86-2.6-ext2.vmdk&quot;.</p><p>6. Download and install &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vmware.com/products/converter/&quot;&gt;VMware Converter&lt;/a&gt;.&nbsp; Install using the defaults (make sure you install both parts if you insist on making a custom install).&nbsp; Using one of the vmx files above as a template, ensure the vmdk just created is referenced from the vmx-file.&nbsp; VMware Converter can install the image straight into VMware ESX Server.&nbsp; Converter will issue a warning or error at some point but this can be ignored.</p><p>7. Once VMware Converter has completed, open the new VM in your MUI of choice.&nbsp; Remove serial and USB device support since it is unnecessary (there is a VGA console in Kamikaze, at least in the latest SVN source - if not you can use the serial device and map it similarly as has been described previously).&nbsp; Ensure that the SCSI controller is BusLogic and not using the LSI device, since that does not work with the previous kernel options supplied.</p><p>8. Log in to the ESX server using SSH, so that you can access and hand edit the .vmx-file created by VMware Converter.&nbsp; It is usually found on &quot;/vmfs/volumes/...&quot; somewhere.&nbsp; In the vmx-file, for every network interface you have added, add at the bottom of the file &#039;ethernet0.virtualDev = &quot;e1000&quot;&#039;.&nbsp; Obviously you need to increment &quot;ethernet0&quot; if you have further adapters.&nbsp; This tells VMware ESX Server to accept the Intel e1000 network driver.</p><p>9. Done.&nbsp; You can clone away all you like and have a 100 node OpenWrt install within minutes <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" />!</p><p>It would be nice if someone took the time to port the VMware-tools drivers to the build system.&nbsp; I tried porting vmxnet.ko and got it to run and insert into the Kamikaze kernel.&nbsp; However, only ICMP and ARP messages were issued and received, everything else was dropped, as far as I could tell.</p><p>Best wishes,<br />Lucaferr</p>									</div>

					<p>The Wiki page is not very newbie friendly, so I&#039;m having some questions and comments regarding building Kamikaze for VMWare.</p><p>#1 My Setup / Prerequisites<br />Installed Debian 4.0 r1 in a VM with just the standard configuration (no server, desktop, etc.).<br />After installing the mentioned packages from <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=9180">this thread</a> still AWK was missing, which I could install via &quot;aptitude install gawk&quot;.<br />Would be great to list the most typical packages in the Wiki too, including gawk.</p><p>#2 Source / Patches<br />Downloaded the 7.07 source, extracted it in &quot;/var/build&quot; (root:users, rwxrwxr-x) via &quot;tar -xjf kamikaze_7.07.tar.bz2&quot;.<br />The Wiki talks about applying some patches, but there are no patches linked.<br />Are they missing or is the information inaccurate?</p><p>#3 Build / Menu Config<br />In &quot;/var/build/kamikaze_7.07&quot; called &quot;make menuconfig&quot;.<br />Can not find a target profile for VMWare, only a Soekris profile? Is this an aftereffect of the missing patches above?<br />What to do with the kmod-e1000? I assume it has to be built into the Kernel (=Y), doesn&#039;t it?</p><p>A just-for-fun &quot;make&quot; worked fine, but I think I didn&#039;t get a VMWare-compatible image out of it.<br />Also had a short look at the 7.09 release, but couldn&#039;t see any difference.</p><p>Any help greatly appreciated.</p><p>Regards<br />Maddes</p>									</div>

					<p>I added a page for using QEMU: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/RunningKamikazeOnQEMUHowTo">http://wiki.openwrt.org/RunningKamikazeOnQEMUHowTo</a></p><p>I found I had to grow the image using dd (otherwise QEMU reports errors trying to access blocks beyond the end of the file), but nobody seems to have mentioned this above. Am I missing a QEMU option which would allow this to happen automatically?</p>									</div>
