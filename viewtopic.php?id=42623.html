					<p>Forgive me in advance for noobiness, I&#039;m new to all this <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />So I&#039;m trying to open a port on the router, for no real reason for now other than to learn some.<br />Using the Luci GUI, I browse to firewall traffic rules and set a new rule to open port 6112 on the router. It&#039;s set to match: <br />Any TCP, UDP<br />From any host in wan<br />To any router IP at port 6112 on this device</p><p>and the action is set to accept input. </p><p>However, when I browse to some online service that checks whether a specific port is open on my IP, it announces that the port 6112 (at my IP) is closed. </p><p>I then checked the status page of my firewall, verified the rule exists. I then saw whether the counter for the rule increases every time I attempt the test, and indeed it does! Every time I repeat the port checker test, the firewall reports new packets that fall into the rule I set (which has action accept) but the checker still reports the port as closed. </p><p>Note also I installed and configured upnp correctly, and the ports it forwards are open and work correctly, not sure if that&#039;s relevant.</p><p>Any ideas?</p>									</div>

					<p>That&#039;s normal. The port is actually open, but without something on your router using that port it will read as closed.</p>									</div>

					<p>Is there any program that you can configure to &quot;use&quot; a specific port, for testing purposes? I won&#039;t be satisfied till I see it says open for my own eyes <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Not sure I follow. What needs to be done to make port 6112 &quot;used&quot; so I can check whether or not it&#039;s open?</p><p>EDIT: I set dropbear&#039;s port to 6112 instead of the default 22, and created a session, but it still reports as closed.</p><p>EDIT 2: Alright, nevermind! Once I set 6112 to be dropbear&#039;s port AND created a firewall rule, this port registers as open.</p><p>My next question is, is there not a way to have a port be open without a program using it? I realize security-wise it&#039;s a nightmare, I just want to check.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ctlaltdefeat</strong> on 1 Mar 2013, 23:13)</p>

					<p>the installer for that tool you mention fails on my machine.&nbsp; (after i asks me&nbsp; whether to install the ask.com toolbar, i uncheck those boxes, click &quot;next&quot; and then some screens flash by in half a second and the installer exits w/o message and i don&#039;t see anything installed)</p><p>But, setting up a rule as you describe and&nbsp; using this site&nbsp; <a href="http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/">http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/</a>&nbsp; shows the port as open.&nbsp; (as long as i have something listening on that port on my local machine.&nbsp; &nbsp;in this case&nbsp; &quot;netcat&quot; under cygwin but can be whatever you want)&nbsp; &nbsp;nc -l 1234 </p><p>If i kill netcat (w/o changing anything on the router) it reads as closed.</p><p>BTW, if you&#039;re using Luci, did you click &quot;save &amp; apply&quot; ?&nbsp; &nbsp;(top right corner should say 0 unsaved changes)</p>									</div>
