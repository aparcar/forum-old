					<p>Hi,<br />I want to develop a Wi-Fi probe script that would list all the Wi-Fi devices (mobile &amp; desktop) in its vicinity that are not even connected to the AP.<br />I have read documentation that many people have done it but I am unable to find any documentation on how to do it.<br />Thanks for your help in advance.</p>									</div>

The simple reason is, that some people need to stay ahead in research/development to<br />make their living. Be patient, will take some time for docs to show up, as this is still a &quot;hot topic&quot;.</p>									</div>

					<p>To protect the user&#039;s privacy, many devices now transmit only random MAC addresses while they are not connected to an AP. So the usefulness of such a script is not what it used to be.</p>									</div>
