					<p>Greetings,<br />i s<br />I have a WNDR3800 running &quot;12.09 r36088&quot;.&nbsp; The output of uname is Linux XXXXXX 3.3.8 #1 Sat Mar 23 16:49:30 UTC 2013 mips GNU/Linux.</p><p>My wife has an iphone 4 (no jokes, we all make our compromises to stay married) that seems unable to keep a stable connection to my home router.</p><p>If I reboot or do a wifi down then up, the problem goes away for a while but eventually returns.</p><p>1.&nbsp; Any recommendations for isolating the problem?&nbsp; Is there a software package or a way to test the system to let me know if it is a phone hardware problem, a phone software problem, or a router problem?&nbsp; Everybody else seems to be fine with the wifi, including my apple work machine.</p><p>2.&nbsp; Anybody know of upgrades / changes to later versions of openWRT that might impact this issue?&nbsp; I&#039;m willing to do the labor of upgrade if it will help but I don&#039;t want to screw with a well working system if it is not broken.</p><p>Any general advice welcome.&nbsp; Thank you for your time.</p>									</div>

					<p>Try barrier breaker (14.07, now at rc3). It&#039;s very stable and there are several fixes for atheros wifi chips (as used in the WNDR3800).</p>									</div>
