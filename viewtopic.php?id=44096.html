					<p>Hello all.</p><p>My problem was initially being discussed here: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=200180">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=200180</a></p><p>After getting the system to install OpenWRT on a RouterBOARD 750GL, and bring up the VPN (OpenVPN Client), I&#039;m having a problem unclear. The communication through the tunnel (tun0) between the RB and the server occurs normally, but the navigation (WEB) is not established. Anyone have any clue as to what can be? I can spend more data, just ask me.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>alisson</strong> on 9 May 2013, 16:43)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m not sure that I understood your problem correctlyâ€¦ you have got an openvpn server on your router and it is connected with a client. Both can reach each other via ICMP, ect? But you cannot get a HTTP connection to your router?</p><p>If I&#039;m right, check your firewall zones and try to permit the traffic.<br />Otherwise, please correct me!</p>									</div>
