It seems you have some success in connecting with stock TP-Link firmware (or LEDE, im not sure). Did this work with another sim/network? </p><p>I manage to flash LEDE from Heinz (btw thanks for that .bin !!) and log into LTE modem GUI. The system is now reading sim from other network (before flybox only gives error incorrect sim). So its connecting to 4G network, but no WAN connection is established. I tried with 3 different networks (the sim&#039;s all work in mobile phone). I figure its something with LEDE and some settings still in LTE modem firmware? </p><p>Then i used Heinz recovery.bin to flash to TP-Link stock firmware (160412). Not sure if this is also flashing the LTE modem&#039;s firmware (doesnt look like it?)<br />Anyway TP-Link firmware works, but still same problem - it recognizes sim, gives 4G signal strength, but cannot connect WAN. I tried every possible APN setting from provider. </p><p>The TP-Link interface has very limited settings (APN, static/dynamic, username, pass &amp; authentication). There is no port selection, dialup number, server settings etc. </p><p>My feeling is the network (Orange) is locked down on the LTE modem firmware. Some way with LEDE to patch the firmware or see why the sim is connected but not getting internet? <br />Or these networks have blocked all IEMI numbers from devices customized from other networks? </p><p>Anyone have any luck with trying to open up Orange Flybox MR200 to non-Orange networks?<br />Thanks!</p>									</div>

Maybe it has to do with version/region? This model is MR200 (EU) on original &#039;custom&#039; firmware (and the update firmware i tried is also EU version). <br />Is your recovery .bin 160402 based on US? Because I have no idea why it would reject stock firmware update when it&#039;s already on 160402 stock? </p><p>I have updated to official LEDE release, I will try to put stock again and test upgrade, maybe I can try with other region version? </p><p>In your .bin compile for LEDE Did you remove the LTE modem section? I wonder if there is sim-lock on modem? </p><p>Thanks for all the help!!</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve managed to install LEDE on my MR200. Works fine but I&#039;ve noticed none of the settings for the modem part survive a reboot. So password resets to default and also the &quot;dial-up settings&quot; use defaults from my telco. Which work but I&#039;ve been experimenting with IPv6 and maybe eventually use it if I can get it to work but if the modem part resets to defaults after a reboot, well, it&#039;s not going to be much fun since the default config is IPv4 only.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks Heinz &quot;To configure router use address <a href="http://192.168.1.1/">http://192.168.1.1/</a> &quot;<br />Was what I was missing. I just did not know where the LEDE interface was.<br />From <a href="http://192.168.1.1/">http://192.168.1.1/</a> use &#039;system - backup/flash firmware&#039; (that will be within LEDE not the TP-Link modem web interface) to restore oem firmware makes sense now.<br />Also I guess I use ttp://192.168.1.1/ &#039;system - backup/flash firmware&#039; and point it to where I downloaded <a href="https://downloads.lede-project.org/releases/17.01.2/targets/ramips/mt7620/lede-17.01.2-ramips-mt7620-ArcherMR200-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin">https://downloads.lede-project.org/rele … pgrade.bin</a> to upgrade LEDE.</p><p>I am sure that these steps must be in the thread somewhere, but collecting them together in one post or a wiki might be a good idea.</p>									</div>
