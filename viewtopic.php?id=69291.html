I read in another topic that exist a hardware component made to limit current (500mA). So, I found a 5V 3A power supply and adapted it on the USB hub. Nevertheless, I have to be careful with voltage loop, that can transmit power of the hub to the router. Sorry for the bad english.</p>									</div>
