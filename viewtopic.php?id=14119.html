					<p>Hello!</p><p>I upgraded from DD-WRT to X-WRT sometime ago using the web interface. However, I still see DD-WRT stuff in NVRAM. How can I fix this issue? I have used wl500g-clear-nvram.trx file but no success! I have read that if I manually delete something, it might make my device permanently bricked.</p><p>Anyone know how?</p><p>- TKN</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,<br />I would also like to know if it&#039;s possible to clear all the nvram variables set by White Russian and return to the factory settings of the 500gp. I tried this script :<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/Faq#head-71cacf8460752af3f5771d2fae54923ded5beb9c">http://wiki.openwrt.org/Faq#head-71cacf â€¦ 3ded5beb9c</a></p><p>but it does not delete all the openvrt variables. </p><p>Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Tex-Twil</strong> on 25 Feb 2008, 09:47)</p>
