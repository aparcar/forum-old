					<p>This is a request for assistance that is not really OpenWRT related.</p><p>I have an Inventel Livebox and am trying to put on a 2.6.8.1 kernel from another BCM6348 Router (usr9108) source. <br />When I tftp the kernel via RedBoot and then exec it, it does not boot. </p><p>The OpenWRT 2.6.22 kernel does boot. I noticed from some digging that some changes needed to be done to the OpenWRT 2.6 kernel to get it to exec via RedBoot. Can anyone tell me what they are so I can try them on the 2.6.8.1 kernel.</p><p>If this isn&#039;t possible, what&#039;s the chances of 2.6.12.6 closed source drivers working on an OpenWRT 2.6.22 kernel</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Andy</p>									</div>
