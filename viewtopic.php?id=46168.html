					<p>Here&#039;s another alternative for testing from the command line, since speedtest.net doesn&#039;t actually do a complete test. (It only sends a few pings before starting the download/upload test, but ignores what happens to latency during the transfers.) If the latency gets high during the test, the router has bufferbloat. (Is your router bloated? See note below)</p><p>Two good tests:</p><p>* DSLReports Speed Test a nice web-based (no annoying plugins!) speed test <a href="http://dslreports.com/speedtest">http://dslreports.com/speedtest</a></p><p>* For the command-line: The Bufferbloat project (at <a href="http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/cerowrt/wiki">http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/cerowrt/wiki</a> ) created a script - betterspeedtest.sh that tests download and upload speeds (like all the others) but also measures latency *during* the test. </p><p>To run the test on Barrier Breaker or Chaos Calmer, you need to install the netperf package. Do this one time:<br />&nbsp; - Go to System -&gt; Software, click Update Lists<br />&nbsp; - Click the Available Packages tab, and find &quot;netperf&quot; in the &quot;N&quot; section, then click Install</p><p>Next retrieve the betterspeedtest.sh script from Github at <a href="https://github.com/richb-hanover/OpenWrtScripts">https://github.com/richb-hanover/OpenWrtScripts</a> Either copy/paste the script, or use the steps in the README to pull them down using git.</p><p>Finally, run the script with </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>sh betterspeedtest.sh</code></pre></div><p><strong>Note for Bufferbloat on OpenWrt:</strong> Fortunately, OpenWrt has the SQM/fq_codel scripts that basically eliminate Bufferbloat. See this page for instructions: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/sqm">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/sqm</a> )</p>									</div>
