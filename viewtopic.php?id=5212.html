					<p>I&#039;ve read ( <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=4832">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=4832</a> ) that using OpenVPN cuts throughput down from about 600 Kbytes/sec to 300 KBytes/sec.&nbsp; Vincentfix has kindly pointed out that the WRT platform doesn&#039;t have any special encryption hardware, but tosuja mentions that WPA2 traffic can run at up to 12 Mbps ~= 120 Kbytes/sec.</p><p>So I&#039;m wondering if there are any stats on what the Linksys WRT4GS platform can do in terms of throughput in the various modes.&nbsp; The ones I can think of are:</p><p>wired / no security<br />wired / openVPN<br />wireless / 54 / no security<br />wireless / 54 / openVPN<br />wireless / 54 / WEP64<br />wireless / 54 / WEP128<br />wireless / 54 / WPA<br />wireless / 54 / WPA2<br />wireless / 54 speedbooster / (etc)</p><p>A long time ago I read that speedbooster isn&#039;t supported in the OpenWrt world, yet the wl program seems to support it.&nbsp; Will anyone describe the current situation?</p>									</div>
