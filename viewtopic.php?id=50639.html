					<p>A few months ago I replaced my DD-WRT Linksys WRT160Nv3 with a Netgear WNDR3800 with the latest OpenWRT.&nbsp; I absolutely love the versatility of it, being able to script everything and not being restricted to the limited storage and configuration options DD-WRT provides.&nbsp; I looked again recently and found out that my 160Nv3 is now supported as well, albeit with no luci web interface.&nbsp; I installed it and everything seems to be working as far as interfaces go.</p><p>What I want to be able to do with this old router now is use it as a wireless client for multiple Ethernet devices.&nbsp; DD-WRT allowed me to do this on this router but required entering all the SSID/security info in by hand and selecting client bridge mode.&nbsp; With OpenWRT I can more readily scan for wireless networks which is nice and is more in line with what I&#039;d like to do.</p><p>Ideally, I want to script the router such that when I plug it in, it automatically hosts a DHCP server on 192.168.1.1 and provides telnet/ssh/etc.&nbsp; You would then connect from your wired device and scan for available AP&#039;s.&nbsp; Selecting one would allow you to enter the password (preferably selecting the correct security) and connect wlan interface to that network.&nbsp; Then it would shut down the DHCP server, bridge the wired ports to the wlan interface, and take a DHCP address on the wireless network internally.</p><p>Doing a manual run-through of the steps I want to take:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># iwlist wlan0 scan</code></pre></div><p>This displays all the available AP&#039;s correctly.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># vim /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf</code></pre></div><div class="codebox"><pre><code>network={
    ssid=&quot;MyNetwork&quot;
     psk=&quot;MyPassphrase&quot;
}</code></pre></div><div class="codebox"><pre><code># wpa_supplicant -iwlan0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf</code></pre></div><p>Now I&#039;m authenticated and connected to my other router on the wlan0 interface.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># udhcpc -i wlan0</code></pre></div><p>Now this router has a DHCP client IP address on wlan0 and I can ping the other router and other network devices.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># brctl show</code></pre></div><p>I have one bridge called &quot;br-lan&quot; consisting of eth0.1 interface.&nbsp; Now I want to bridge that interface to the wireless.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># brctl addif br-lan wlan0
brctl: bridge br-lan: Operation not supported</code></pre></div><p>It fails.</p><p>I read that using 4addr mode may solve this, so I tried:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># iw dev wlan0 set 4addr on
# brctl addif br-lan wlan0</code></pre></div><p>and now br-lan appears to contain both eth0.1 and wlan0.&nbsp; However, the wlan0 interface quits working.&nbsp; I can no longer ping my other router.&nbsp; Turning off 4addr mode requires removing wlan0 from the bridge, otherwise it fails with &quot;command failed: Device or resource busy (-16)&quot;.&nbsp; Once turning 4addr off however it starts pinging fine again.&nbsp; Obviously the hardware is capable of a proper WiFi-to-Ethernet bridge client as it worked in DD-WRT so what am I doing wrong?</p>									</div>
