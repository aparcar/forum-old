					<p>Hi,<br />I have a N600 router on my network with a PC, Laptop, Blu-ray (DLNA support), Samsung TV (DLNA support) and 2 andoid phones. Only the laptop and phones are wireless connected. Also I have an external WD Passport HDD connected to the router USB.<br />I don&#039;t know why I can&#039;t stream my video files .mkv through DLNA from my external HDD (avi, mp4 works). I can see all the video files but can&#039;t stream .mkv files<br />Is this a problem with N600 routers or with my settings?<br />The firmware is 1.04.<br />If you have a solution for this I will be happy to try it.<br />Please help me!!!</p>									</div>

					<p>I had same mistake and on one of forum I found that after you download firmware to avoid this type of error you have to immediatly instant luci and other packeks. Download again firmware and immediatly install luci and all packages what you need. Time frame is about 24 hours.

I am struggling to get LuCi installed - actually can&#039;t seem to get on the web - connected the router directly to the cable modem - the power light and the globe light is on. </p><p>UPDATE: After a few hours and one cable modem reboot (not sure why I didn&#039;t do that before) I got Luci installed. I then tried to setup repeater using&nbsp; a) <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient</a> and b) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rbsh2zxPnk">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rbsh2zxPnk</a></p><p>The wiki instructions results in a &quot;bridge&quot; interface that is connected to main router SSID. I don&#039;t see a new SSID created at the end. In the youtube video - the person seems to be creating multiple SSID on same radio. I was not able to enable both SSID on the same radio in WD MyNet N 600. Any ideas how to extend signal/use N600 as repeater?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>shikarishambu</strong> on 12 Jan 2014, 02:30)</p>
