					<p>normally you donÂ´t replace the bootloader.</p><p>So normally the question isnÂ´t what is use by kamikaze. it should be which bootloader is running on your device (cfe, redboot, ....) and which partionlayout and&nbsp; binaryformat it can deal with. </p><p>Kamikaze itself is very flexible. you can build various different images, so you should be able to get one that your bootloader can load.</p><p>there are only a few devices where you have to replace the bootloader to be able the run linux on it. Afaik thats often the case for devices running vxworks. </p><p>To find out which bootloader is used by your device, you can look at the documentation (a good place is the device specific information in table of hardware) or you connect a serial console, so you can access the cli of the bootloader.</p>									</div>
