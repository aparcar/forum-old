					<p>I am having some strange issues with HairyDairyMaid&#039;s debricker utility and trying to write a new CFE to my wrt.&nbsp; I totally noobed the router by trying to upgrade to RC6 with ipkg (I know, no need to rub it in)</p><p>Anyway, so I made a JTAG cable and I can read just fine.&nbsp; I trying flashing an NVRAM and read it back and it works just fine.</p><p>Then I try flashing CFE.BIN and if I stop it at 25%, just before getting to the next block, I can read it back and everything is the same.&nbsp; However, at 25%, it seems to go back to the beginning and hose the values that it just finished writing at the start of the CFE section.&nbsp; I have tried various different things but nothing seems to work.&nbsp; Can anybody out there help me?</p><p>PS - Also to note that if I erase the CFE, I can use ./wrt54g -flash:cfe.&nbsp; After that, I have to use the /noemw flag until I erase CFE again.&nbsp; Is that supposed to happen?</p>									</div>

					<p>Thought I would post an update on this, in case anybody ever had a similar problem.&nbsp; Turns out that a tiny piece of solder has fallen on the legs of the flash chip and bridged two pins.&nbsp; Removing that allowed me to flash the router back to life.</p>									</div>
