					<p>Hi<br />I just got my self a MR3020 and flashed it with OpenWrt and I love it. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />I am not new to routing and switching coz I used to be a Cisco CCNP for many many years ago.</p><p>I started to play with OpenWrt and soon found out that I need more RAM and FLASH so I have ordered a 64Meg RAM upgrade and a 16Meg flash upgrade (W25Q128FVSIG)</p><p>I guess RAM upgrade is just to replace the RAM chip on the board and then boot it up. Will the new RAM size be auto detected or do I have to change some other things?</p><p>For the FLASH upgrade I read some that I need to read out some important data from the org FLASH and then put this back on the new chip. Also I read that the boot loader need some modding to recognize the new size?<br />Can anyone help me out here? Like what data I need to copy and what I have to do with the boot loader?</p><p>Also. When I get out the data from the org FLASH. How do you put it back it to the new FLASH?<br />Do I need a SPI programmer or can I use the MR3020 to do the job?</p><p>I have a Teensy 2.0++ that I can use to write to the new chip but this will be a bit hazzle for me so if there is an easier way I would be great full if some of you can share.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p><p>Regards</p>									</div>

					<p>nebbia88: Thanks for guiding me in the right direction.</p><p>After much reading I found a way to program my flash chip. Turns out that there are many ways (three that I know of) to do the flash upgrade.<br />The method I chose was to go with u-boot_mod which will fix everything for you.

AR9331, like probably most or even every Atheros WiSoC, has only 2-bit bank addressing, so it can control a maximum of 4 banks (2 bits gives us 4 values).</p><p>There are 1 Gbit (128 MiB) and even 2 Gbit (256 MiB) DDR2 SDRAM memory in single chip, with 16-bit data bus, on the market, examples:<br />- Winbond W971 series: 8M x 8 banks x 16-bit (64M x 16-bit), 128 MiB in total<br />- Hynix H5PS1G6 series: 8M x 8 banks x 16-bit (64M x 16-bit), 128 MiB in total<br />- Winbond W972 series: 16M x 8 banks x 16-bit (128M x 16-bit), 256 MiB in total<br />- Micron MT47H series: 16M x 8 banks x 16-bit (128M x 16-bit), 256 MiB in total</p><p>DDR space for AR9331 in address space map is 256 MiB, so in theory, if you find DDR1 or DDR2 memory chip organized as 16M x 4 banks x 16-bit (64M x 16-bit) or even 32M x 4 banks x 16-bit (128M x 16-bit)... it should work, again - in theory.</p><p>And here is a good news - there are some DDR1/2 chips with that organization on the market (or were, because most I have found are EOL). But, the bad news is simple - price for 16M x 4 banks x 16-bit (64M x 16-bit) DDR1 in TSOP-II package (which fits in most TP-Link low-level routers) is mega gigantic... ~30 USD per one chip... and MOQ is not 1 pcs.</p><p>So, at this moment, from practical point of view, 8M x 4 banks x 16-bit (32M x 16-bit), 64 MiB in total, is the maximum.</p><p><strong>Important edit</strong>: AR9331 has only 12-bit address bus for external memory (A0~A12)... page 16 in datasheet. So, no way to use chips which needs A0~A13 address inputs... so, no way to use bigger chips on AR9331.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pepe2k</strong> on 3 May 2014, 13:43)</p>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have openwrt on my MR3020 and I take it on the road. It works in many hotels. However, I had some unsuccessful stories, e.g. the hotel I am staying now. I connect the cable from wall RJ45 port to Ethernet port of the router, the router obtains the ip from hotel server(router), my laptop connects to the router via wifi, everything seems right. When I try to open website, it does not open the hotel login page(to enter the password). Tried many times, no success. </p><p>Checked the following:<br />1. Plug in the cable directly to my laptop, hotel login page opens in a second, internet works fine after entering the password.<br />2. The router configuration has not been changed after last successful use, router is able to get ip address, and able to assign ip address to my laptop.</p><p>I believe that there are something to do with hotel login page. What is the possible reason that the login page cannot be opened if I have my router connected in between my laptop and hotel network, Any suggestion?</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks. I soldered a USB hub and attached a USB drive inside. I remember there is a post or wiki that describes the procedure how to extend the router flash memory by utilizing USB storage, but now I could not find it.

					<p>Good. I just cannot recall the proper name. Now I am stuck again because of the space on rootfs while trying to install some packages e.g c2prog in order to format my USB to ext4. The USB stick is already inside the router so I am willing not to open the box and take out it to use my computer for formatting. The space of my router is:</p><p>root@TL-MR3020:/tmp/log# df -h<br />Filesystem&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Size&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Used Available Use% Mounted on<br />rootfs&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.1M&nbsp; &nbsp;1020.0K&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;68.0K&nbsp; 94% /<br />/dev/root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.0M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.0M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0 100% /rom<br />tmpfs&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 14.3M&nbsp; &nbsp; 580.0K&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;13.7M&nbsp; &nbsp;4% /tmp<br />tmpfs&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;512.0K&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; 512.0K&nbsp; &nbsp;0% /dev<br />/dev/mtdblock3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.1M&nbsp; &nbsp;1020.0K&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;68.0K&nbsp; 94% /overlay<br />overlayfs:/overlay&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.1M&nbsp; &nbsp;1020.0K&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;68.0K&nbsp; 94% /</p><p>/tmp still have 13.7M free, but the rootfs is almost full because it has only 1.1M.

					<p>Hello,<br />I just got a new MR3020 v1.7 and we want to use it as a small file server for a local orphanage.<br />I downloaded the OpenWRT (openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-mr3020-v1-squashfs-factory) image and uploaded it using the TP-Link WebUI. The router rebooted and I tried to connect to 192.168.1.1 with no luck... I tried pinging 192.168.1.1 also without luck (I set my IP to 192.168.1.2 and SUBMASK to 255.255.255.0). <br />On my laptop a wireless network appears &quot;carrierwrt-6A65C0&quot; it&#039;s password protected and i can&#039;t any info on it on google.</p><p>I also tried turning on failsafe it worked the WPS led is blinking and when i ping 192.168.1.1 it shows up but i can&#039;t connect to it using putty (telnet just closes without message)</p><p>I have no idea what to do now, and we cannot afford a new router, i&#039;m older and i dont have much technical knowledge about computing and my english is quite rusty. Thank you for any help!</p>									</div>
