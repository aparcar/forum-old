					<p>I bought an Archer C7 V2 and installed 14.07 a few days ago. Everything was working perfectly but there were some problems with ath10k that were supposedly fixed by updating to cc. So I updated via PuTTy but it seemed to freeze up during the &quot;rebooting router&quot; part. I wasn&#039;t able to access anything by going to 192.168.1.1 and I couldn&#039;t get access to the Internet to do opkg update. Eventually I figured out how to edit /etc/config/network and realized that my wan was set to usb0 because I was using USB tethering as my wan. I tried to correct this, but when I did the /etc/init.d/network restart it seemed to freeze after a while (maybe I didn&#039;t wait long enough before starting a new putty session and trying to get back in?) but now I don&#039;t even get a prompt to login when I connect to it via PuTTy. I tried unplugging the and even unplugging it and then holding the reset button, but nothing seems to work.</p><p>I&#039;d like to get it back to factory settings, and I made a backup at the very beginning as instructed. I&#039;ve read the return to original firmware wiki, but I couldn&#039;t seem to do anything with it since I couldn&#039;t download anything through wget.</p><p>Can anyone point me in the right direction?</p><p>EDIT: I think I&#039;m going to order a USB to TTL cord and try to reset it that way. I&#039;ve tried doing it through TFTP, but it seems way too complicated for me to figure out right now.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>inverseParanoid</strong> on 14 May 2015, 01:54)</p>

					<p>If you have command line access to the router, then the &quot;firstboot&quot; command will return everything to default for openwrt, hopefully fixing some of the problems.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, somehow I got internet working but opkg update and opkg install luci are still failing. The System LED is also still constantly on, which is supposed to be an indicator of a system error (it&#039;s supposed to be flashing), but it&#039;s obviously able to give me internet right now so something&#039;s working.</p><p>I thought maybe it was a dns error because i can ping 8.8.8.8 but not google.com (says bad address, or if i type <a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a> it says &quot;bad port spec&quot;). So I tried uci set network.wan.dns=&#039;8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4&#039; but it didn&#039;t seem to fix anything.</p>									</div>

					<p>Opwnwrt flashes the system led while booting, but it goes solid once it is fully booted. This is different behavior from the stock firmware.</p><p>You can use scp to copy a new firmware to the router, but it should be possible to get luci working.&nbsp; What is the exact output from &quot;opkg update&quot;</p><p>Did you do a uci commit and then restart? The uci changes don&#039;t get saved until uci commit is run, and a reboot of the router ensures that the opd settings aren&#039;t being used.&nbsp; It does sound like dns could be the issue.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for you help, and that comment about the light staying on the whole time (now I&#039;ll stop expecting different behavior). I was able to get it working by just trying a whole bunch of things and then all of a sudden it started going again.</p><p>The main problem was that after I did the firstboot to clear it all out I was trying to give it internet through a different router (I had another router hooked up so the family could still have internet while I was trying to get this fixed and I just ran an ethernet from its LAN to this router&#039;s WAN). Once I direct connected it and did a firstboot I was able to get internet connectivity and update opkg and install luci.</p><p>All seems good now, the only remaining issue is that the Tx on my 5G network is capped at 6Mbits, but I&#039;m sure I can tackle that problem through google or finding some other threads.</p>									</div>
