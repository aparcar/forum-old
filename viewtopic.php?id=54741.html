					<p>I don&#039;t see the problem. The webinterface doesn&#039;t use virtual hosts, so any domain which resolves to your ip address should do.</p><p>If you want to use the public interface you&#039;ll have to set a port forwarding from the wan to a lan address. Or set a firewall rule to permit wan access on that port. I&#039;d rather use https than http. In that case you&#039;ll have to enable https either.</p>									</div>

You should point a public domain to the public ip of your router insetad of setting a .lan tld. Then allow port 80 input in the firewall settings.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kh_tsang</strong> on 26 Dec 2014, 11:56)</p>
