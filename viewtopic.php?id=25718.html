					<p>Your client PC resolv.conf should only have the router&#039;s IP. If it points to 127.0.0.1 your client PC will try to resolve locally. Maybe you have already dnsmasq running on the client. If so, stop it.</p><p>Comment out all prepend, append and supersede options of your local dhclient conf file (/etc/dhclp3/dhclient3.conf on debian). Request a new lease:<br /># dhclient or dhclient3</p><p>Check the content of the /etc/resolv.conf on the client. And check how your PC resolves by doing:<br /># dig openwrt.org</p><p>Output should be something like:<br />;; ANSWER SECTION:<br />openwrt.org.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 604800&nbsp; &nbsp; IN&nbsp; &nbsp; A&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>78.24.191.177</strong></p><p>;; Query time: 45 msec<br />;; SERVER: <strong>192.168.0.200#53</strong>(192.168.0.200)<br />;; WHEN: Sat Jul 17 08:42:46 2010<br />;; MSG SIZE&nbsp; rcvd: 45</p><p>The SERVER value in the ANSWER SECTION should show the router IP through which the client tries to resolve the domain name.</p><p>If you want to add different DNS server names you can also add these lines in the /etc/dnsmasq.conf<br />dhcp-option=6,0.0.0.0,xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx,yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy<br />strict-order</p>									</div>
