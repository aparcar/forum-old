					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I was wondering about how a packages travels through my router (TP-Link WR1043ND)? My setup is:</p><p>[pc1 = 192.168.1.2] -- [router = 192.168.1.153] -- [internet]<br />[pc2 = 192.168.1.4] --/</p><p>pc1 and pc2 are connected to ethernet ports, which are one vlan port (eth0.1) and bridged with the wlan interface to br-lan.</p><p>When I sent a package from pc1 to pc2 I thought the following would happen: packages enters router, router makes routing decision (and maybe other stuff), package leaves router.</p><p>Somehow that seems to be wrong because with tcpdump on the router I can&#039;t see any pc1-pc2 traffic, and iptables doesn&#039;t work on any pc1-pc2 traffic.</p><p>Can anyone explain to me where I am wrong or at least have some pointers?</p><p>Cheers,<br />Simon</p>									</div>

					<p>The router only performs routing functions on WAN&lt;-&gt;LAN traffic. Traffic between connected machines doesn&#039;t need routing and is handled by the switch.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks! That means that openwrt doesn&#039;t &quot;see&quot; the traffic because it travels through my tp-link via the switch and openwrt can only work on routed traffic?</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes. You can isolate all switch ports and then bridge them together in software but this will have a huge performance impact, it certainly won&#039;t manage gbit speeds anymore then.</p>									</div>
