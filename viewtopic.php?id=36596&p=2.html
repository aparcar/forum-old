Copy http adress from string in program )<br />4. Run putty. Connect to your router by entering router IP adress - default 192.168.1.1 choose SSH, default port is 22. and press Open<br />5. Login as root. Enter your password. <br />6. Enter commands &quot;cd /tmp&quot;<br />7. &quot;wget http://YOUR_PC_IP/FIRMWARE_NAME.bin&quot; (from HFS)<br />8. &quot;mtd -r write /tmp/FIRMWARE_NAME.bin firmware&quot;<br />9. Wait a little.
