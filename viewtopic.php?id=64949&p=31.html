					<p>Going to have to drop back to r2221. Getting pauses on 5GHz wireless tonight after having been up for&nbsp; 8 days and had been performing without issue running r2446. However, tonight I was watching some videos on my NAS which is Ethernet attached to router. Watching video using a Amazon Fire TV connected on 5GHz wireless. Have done this many times over the last few days without issue. </p><p>Will change to r2221 tomorrow when no one is using the network. </p><p>--bill</p>									</div>

					<p>@david, because of issues with 1124 wifi driver, any chance of either reverting to 1011 for your next release, issuing a release of r2446 with 1011, or issuing a 1011 driver compiled to work on r2446 (kernel 4.4.36)?</p><p>Much thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>David, more bad news, I&#039;m afraid.&nbsp; After booting into failsafe mode with an FTDI USB-232R-3V3 cable (just GND, Tx, and Rx attached to the serial header pins), I get nothing on the serial console, either.&nbsp; And this isn&#039;t the first time I&#039;ve used this device to connect to a serial header -- I used the same cable and setup on a laptop to connect to the serial console in Netgear WNR3500L and -Lv2 routers.</p><p>@starcms:&nbsp; The failsafe recovery is covered here:&nbsp; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe">wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe</a>&nbsp; .&nbsp; One thing I do not understand about booting into the alternate partition:&nbsp; Right now I have the most recent Linksys firmware on the alternate partition.&nbsp; If I boot into that partition, how to I go about modifying files in the LEDE partition?</p><p>Note that I&#039;m not quite bricked here -- I think I can effect a reset to clear the /overlay partition.&nbsp; The problem is, I&#039;ll lose a good couple of days of work.&nbsp; Since I know failsafe doesn&#039;t work now, though, I&#039;ll do more frequent backups.</p>									</div>
