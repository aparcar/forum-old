					<p>Router: TP-Link TL-WR1043ND v1</p><p>Hi!<br/>I just got back to stock (the stripped v1 version) and now I can&#039;t login! Even did a router reset, tried user: root and the previous password I used in openwrt, tried admin/admin / admin/pass / user/pass etc.</p><p>It isn&#039;t the first time doing this. In fact, everytime I go back to stock I will do this. The only way to get over is by doing the Unbrick Method.</p><p>Before getting back to stock I was on openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr1043nd-v1-squashfs-factory<br/>downloaded the TL-WR1043ND-V1-stripped .bin file to the /tmp folder, and did &#039;mtd -r write /tmp/tplink.bin firmware&#039;.<br/>Router rebooted and now I can&#039;t login.</p><p><strong>What to do? Besides unbrick method...<br/><em>I am able to connect to the internet now trough the router because into it&#039;s WAN I&#039;ve got a cable running from another router(the main one).</em></strong></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>AKAndrew</strong> on 3 Jul 2017, 18:55)</p>

					<p>Use the unbrick method.</p><p>We have no way of knowing the user accounts and passwords of random firmware images that you download from the Internet. The accounts and passwords that you use in OpenWRT are <strong>not retained</strong> when you switch over to another firmware.</p><p>The &#039;stripped&#039; firmware images are just TP-Link&#039;s own firmware with the bootloader part snipped out. If you want to know the user accounts and passwords of this firmware, ask TP-Link&#039;s support for help.</p>									</div>

Or are you per chance downloading a firmware that was stripped by someone else and put available into, say, DropBox or Google Drive? If you are downloading it yourself and it doesn&#039;t work, then TP-Link&#039;s support is the place where you ask questions. If you are downloading a firmware stripped by someone else, then who knows what other changes was done to it?</p><p>Nevertheless, if the credentials they say do not work, then they do not work. End of story, you are locked out. Period, finished, finito. It&#039;s the same as forgetting the password of your personal computer.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>AKAndrew wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I will eventually be forced to do the unbrick method, but how am I supposed to get back to stock firmware if it won&#039;t let me login afterwards?</p></blockquote></div><p>How am I supposed to know? OpenWRT is a community open-source project and comes with absolutely no warranty. You use it at your own risk. If it doesn&#039;t work, or something breaks down, then you and you alone are the person responsible for fixing it. You can questions and discuss problems on this forum, but this question that you&#039;re asking is something we cannot possibly know.</p><p>You can try one trick that I used once with a completely different router model. Build a ramdisk version of OpenWRT for your router, and run it directly from memory through TFTP boot or through a serial console access to the bootloader. Once it is running, you can mount the root filesystem of the OEM firmware and hack the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files to clear the passwords of the OEM firmware. Then you reset the router, boot the OEM firmware and log in with a blank password and change it using &#039;passwd&#039;.</p>									</div>
