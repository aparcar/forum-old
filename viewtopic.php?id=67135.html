					<p>I&#039;m a little bit surprised that this utility hasn&#039;t found its way to a package, and google comes up empty on home-brewed custom packages.</p><p>I&#039;ve looked into it a bit and at first glance it looked simple.&nbsp; However, one of the first steps the Makefile takes is it runs a script to detect cpu feature support and I&#039;m not quite sure how to handle that in a cross-compiled environment.</p><p>It&#039;s also configured to build on BSD, but there&#039;s a Posix Makefile that looks identical to the Debian package Makefile so I&#039;m guessing that would run OK.&nbsp; My initial package just copies Makefile.Posix to Makefile before executing make.</p><p>Any thoughts or insight?&nbsp; Thanks in advance...</p><p>The source:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/Tarsnap/spiped">https://github.com/Tarsnap/spiped</a></p>									</div>
