					<p>Hi, below attach pictures from my modded wr710n (US 1.0) running Barrier Breaker 14.07 with smb and ftp server, support for ntfs drive, add micro usb connector for external power supply, repeater and add usb adapter wn722n working as wireless lan (useful when repeated network is not available).</p><p>Some pics:</p><p>USB Hub 4 Ports:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://imageshack.com/a/img538/7365/Ymf62t.jpg" alt="http://imageshack.com/a/img538/7365/Ymf62t.jpg" /></span><br />Small USB Hub 2.0 self powered.</p><p>External antenna mod:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://imageshack.com/a/img673/5318/LptAa5.jpg" alt="http://imageshack.com/a/img673/5318/LptAa5.jpg" /></span><br />For this mod I had remove J1 (0 ohm resistor) and cut ANT1, I let untouched capacitors around original antenna.</p><p>Micro USB:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://imageshack.com/a/img661/3623/elZR03.jpg" alt="http://imageshack.com/a/img661/3623/elZR03.jpg" /></span><br />Micro USB pins connected to C206 pins, reference: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr710n">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr710n</a></p><p>Internal setup:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://imageshack.com/a/img537/4330/PoowZX.jpg" alt="http://imageshack.com/a/img537/4330/PoowZX.jpg" /></span><br />I wanted original USB port working as if unmodified. To do so, I had to insert hub between original USB data lines on motherboard and original USB socket. For this i had lift d- and d+ in original USB port, GND connected to GND below original USB port, while +5VDC was connected to C206 positive pin because original port is limited to 1A.</p><p>Final setup:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://imageshack.com/a/img537/1118/DHwq7G.jpg" alt="http://imageshack.com/a/img537/1118/DHwq7G.jpg" /></span><br />Working with internal (AC) power supply or this setup can work too with external power supply and at least 5V @ 2A is needed, I used for example iPad 2.1A adapter.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gdl2010</strong> on 4 Mar 2015, 04:10)</p>
