					<p>Hi there, <br />I created new wifi network on my TL-WR1043ND for guest, so now I have two and there is all right. But I want to enable/disable the guest wifi after pressing the QSS button with some script, because I so lazy to login into configuration and there enabling or disabling this wifi. However I can&#039;t find applicable solution. I tried this:<br />uci set wireless.radio0.disabled=1; uci commit wireless; wifi<br />but this command disable me all wifi networks on radio0 and i want disabled only one &quot;wifi-iface&quot;.<br />So next i tried this:<br />ifconfig wlan0-1 down <br />ifconfig wlan0-1 up<br />but this didn&#039;t work for starting wifi.<br />I think that I tried one more, but without success. So last idea was to look at source code of OpenWRT web interface.<br />There is onclick event with &quot;wifi_shutdown(&#039;radio0.network2&#039;, this)&quot; in the wifi_shutdown function is a get request<br />&#039;/cgi-bin/luci/;stok=95a5ef950031cda929b3f82048310b23/admin/network/wireless_&#039; + (reconnect ? &#039;reconnect&#039; : &#039;shutdown&#039;) + &#039;/&#039; + id<br />where id = radio0.network2<br />I think that maybe this is the way, but I don&#039;t know how can I continue.<br />I have OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment 12.09 on my device.<br />So if you have any idea to solve this.<br />At least I sorry for my english <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mourse</strong> on 5 Apr 2014, 20:10)</p>
