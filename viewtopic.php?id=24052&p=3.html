					<p>Okay, the reason why openwrt won&#039;t connect at 300Mbps is due to overlapping Bsses. My neighbourhood is crowded with over 15 APs and all the channels are being used , which is why openwrt doesn&#039;t let me enable full N. Any way I can stop it from scanning the area?</p>									</div>

					<p>just use the old tftp method ring.. you know that otherwise you wouldnt have openwrt on there now</p><p>sonicj, ntfs-3g isnt a program youre going to see in the init scripts.. you have to manually mount ntfs-3g, if you want it to be a little smoother, youll probably want to reformat the drive youre trying to share to FAT, and use the luci-app-samba package to configure it.. as ntfs-3g would have to be done from the command-line... but for samba editing things from the command line gives you much more control</p><p>for either method you should have kmod-usb2 and kmod-usb-storage installed from the package manager, kmod-fs-vfat if you plan to use FAT, ntfs-3g if you want to use ntfs</p><p>to add your drive as a readable and writable ntfs drive, you have to open putty (if youre on windows) connect to the command line of openwrt and type &quot;fdisk -l&quot; and thatll list the connected devices, usually its /dev/sda1</p><p>then from the command line youre going to want to create a folder to mount this too... so i used mkdir /mnt, to make the /mnt directory, then to have the contents of the USB disk show up under this folder, i typed ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /mnt</p><p>after doing this, your device will be readable and writable, and you can move into this directory by typing &quot;cd /mnt&quot; and from here you can use the &quot;mkdir whatever&quot; command to make new folders</p><p>after you have the folders you want to share completed, you open &quot;/etc/samba/smb.conf&quot;... since i installed nano from the package manager, i type &quot;nano /etc/samba/smb.conf&quot;</p><p>within the smb.conf file, youll set up samba, under the global section youll want to give it a netbios name.. this can be any name you want to recognize the drive with... and workgroup you should change to match the name of the network your computers are on... for me, since i use windows this will be &quot;WORKGROUP&quot;.. the rest under this section is fine</p><p>under this section you start adding the name and location of your shares... an example of what this should look like is this</p><p>[Justin]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; path = /mnt/Justin<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; valid users = Justin<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; read only = no<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; guest ok = no</p><p>[Shared]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; path = /mnt/Shared<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; valid users = Justin<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; read only = no<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; guest ok = yes</p><p>where inside the brackets is the name of the share, im not sure this matters, valid users would be the username you want... and where it says path, this is the /mnt/folder you created and want to share, read only should be no, and guest on or off is your choice</p><p>after this youll want to set up a username and password for samba, to do this type &quot;smbpasswd yourname password&quot;</p><p>if it gives you the &quot;no valid user found in /etc/passwd&quot; you may have to edit the /etc/passwd file with a test editor and write a line like this</p><p>username:*:1000:1000:username:/home/username:/bin/false</p><p>just replace &quot;username&quot; with your name.. and run the smbpasswd command again and it should work.. once this is all done samba should be set up and running</p><p>do not be intimidated by any of this, its rather straightforward, im not that linux savvy at all.</p>									</div>

					<p>All right... this firmware is driving nuts... i can&#039;t make the WIFI interface to work with my network.</p><p>I mean, after installing kmod-ath9k, i see a wireless interface/device: &quot;RADIO0&quot;, or &quot;wlan0&quot;...</p><p>My latest goal is to use my wireless device (RADIO0/WLAN0) as a client... connect it to an AP (another router which has internet access)... and then use this connection as if it was my &quot;WAN&quot; port, the one that gives internet access to my local LAN (eth0)...</p><p>please give me some guidance, i&#039;m completely lost with LuCI and openwrt... i have 0 experience with command lines (SSH!?...) or linux. Zero experience. so i&#039;m using exclusively LuCI to configure the router. So far this is what i think i understand:</p><p>First of all, openwrt manages the hardware of the router like this:</p><p>eth0&nbsp; = The classic 4 ports designed for LAN.<br />eth1&nbsp; = The classic single WAN port that every router has. WAN = the &quot;internet provider&quot;.<br />wlan0 = The wireless antennas (lol..)<br />br-lan= what the heck is this?. how is this considered an interface/device?.</p><p>Ok, at fist, i tried not to make this setup too much complicated... so i decided to use everything for what it&#039;s supposed to be used. I connected the WAN port (eth1) directly to one of the LAN ports of the MAIN router (the one that has internet)... and bingo, the buffalo router now has internet access..</p><p>Then, i connected my laptop to one of the 4 ports (eth0) on the buffalo router... and i had internet access!!!, everything works perfectly well...</p><p>All that was left at this point was setup the wlan0/radio0 as a DHCP AP... so i did this (LuCI UI):</p><p>Administration------&gt; Network -----&gt; WiFi ----&gt; RADIO0---&gt;</p><p><a href="http://img7.imageshack.us/img7/2204/94378270.jpg">RADIO0 config</a></p><br /><p>After doing this, i tried connecting to my just created wifi AP... and not surprise: limited connectivity... something was missing... so i went to:</p><p>Administration ---&gt; Network ----&gt; interfaces ---&gt; and found this:</p><p><a href="http://img366.imageshack.us/img366/7153/16991834.jpg">Network interfaces</a></p><p>So, i decided to create a new interface called &quot;WIFI&quot;... i&#039;ve tried MANY tipes of configuration, bridged, unbridged... DHCP &amp; static... i&#039;m going nuts!, it doesn&#039;t work!... </p><p>can somebody please tell me if an interface called &quot;wifi&quot; is necessary?... if so, what settings should i use?...</p><p>do i have to create a new entry for this &quot;wifi&quot; interface in the DHCP tab?, any idea on the settings there?</p>									</div>

					<p>This wrong. If you did what jow wrote the router maybe is connecting, but it doesn&#039;t have an ip address as you set the wireless to use the wan network, which doesn&#039;t have an ip address. Also the firewall rules are deny all incoming traffic on the wan interface.</p><p>Here is what you need to do (modified):</p><p>1) navigate to network -&gt; wireless -&gt; radio0<br />- fill out ssid, channel, key etc.<br />- set network to <strong>lan</strong><br />- set mode to client</p><p>2) navigate to network -&gt; interfaces -&gt; wan<br />- choose <strong>&quot;none&quot;</strong> in the interface field and make it empty</p><p>3) navigate to network -&gt; interfaces -&gt; <strong>lan</strong><br />- either select dhcp or a static ip in the interface field</p>									</div>

					<p>No. As far as I know the ath9k driver/module should work as a client just fine. My laptop has a card that uses the ath9k module/driver and it connects to a wireless network without a problem (acting as a client). However, the ath9k can&#039;t act in client bridged mode.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=68 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Client bridged mode is more transparent than regular client mode in the sense that all devices, both in front of and behind the router in client bridged mode, are all on the same subnet. In client mode, it&#039;s more of a double-nat setup, where you have one nat (the client) behind another nat (the regular router).</p></blockquote></div><p>EDIT: lolcatz deleted his/her last post</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pyther</strong> on 5 Apr 2010, 20:39)</p>

					<p>Ops, sorry about that... yeah, i was asking if the ath9k driver wouldn&#039;t work as a client on this router because of it&#039;s, or the router&#039;s limitations... but i felt my question was completely out of place.</p><p>If my daily routine allows me to do so... i will read and try to learn as much as i can about openwrt and clarify my networking doubts... i have an idea of what i want to do, but i don&#039;t know anything about networking... </p><p>Sadly is more likely that because of my daily routine i will have to wait for a working ddwrt release, which i understand a little bit more... and i know what to do in order to make things work just like i want to.. i have an older buffalo router with ddwrt installed running my network like i have mentioned before, and works perfectly well.</p><p>meanwhile I&#039;ll keep trying a little bit more with open wrt ... and wait for more suggestions on where to start <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lolcatz</strong> on 5 Apr 2010, 21:02)</p>

					<p>Because the option network in the wireless configuration already specifies which network the to-be-created vap is attached to.<br />It is bad practice to reference wireless ifnames in the network configuration:<br />&nbsp; - wifi ifnames are not predictable, if you use multiple vaps you do not know which one becomes wlan0, which one wlan1 etc.<br />&nbsp; - in wds setups, additional wifi ifnames are spawned on demand, so there could be wlan0.sta1, wlan0.sta2, ...<br />&nbsp; - it might introduce race conditions since the wired network setup attempts to bring up wireless while the firmware is not even loaded yet</p><p>~ JoW</p>									</div>
