					<p>OK, time to give Kamikaze a try.</p><p>I have been running Whiterussian for over a year with Chillispot and WDS. I would like to give Kamikaze a try, but I am scratching my head because I find the documentation quite limited, to say the least. My most important NVRAM settings in Whiterussian are as follows:</p><p>lan_ifname=br1<br />lan_ifnames=vlan0</p><p>wifi_ifname=br0<br />wifi_ifnames=eth1 wds0.49153 wds0.49154 wds0.49155 wds0.49156 wds0.49157</p><p>These settings are used to break the bridge between WiFi and LAN, and to prepare the WiFi to accept WDS from a number of wireless clients.</p><br /><p>wl0_ifname=eth1<br />wl0_wds=00:14:BF:E3:17:ED 00:04:E2:D7:6E:14 00:18:39:BC:13:C4 00:18:39:BC:13:CA 00:1A:70:6E:D3:77</p><p>These settings are used to define the MAC addresses that I need for WDS.</p><br /><p>Could someone please give me a &#039;translation&#039; of the settings above so they would run on Kamikaze?</p><br /><p>BR</p><p>Arne-J.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ajauberg</strong> on 17 Jun 2007, 13:51)</p>

					<p>I was also unable to get wds to work. But apparently the info for this is somewhat in the documentation, it just appears to not work when you do it :-\</p>									</div>
