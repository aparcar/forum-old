					<p>Hello,<br />I&#039;d like to purchase a Wi-Fi access point:<br />1. Supported by OpenWRT.<br />2. With 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands.<br />3. Prererably with Atheros Wi-Fi chip, I think it has best driver so far.<br />4. With support for choosing WLAN channel 13 in pre-built OpenWRT firmware. With TP-Link I had to manually rebuild even though channels 12 and 13 are allowed in my region and I bought it here. Had to turn on an option in .config.</p><p>Please suggest some hardware <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
