					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I&#039;m new to OpenWRT but so far I really like it.</p><p>I have two wireless routers with the following model #&#039;s, both runnig Barrier Breaker 14.07 / LuCI Trunk (0.12+svn-r10530)</p><p>First model: <br />TP-Link TL-WDR3600 v1</p><p>Second Model:<br />WD My Net N750</p><p>My test client is a Lenvo T440s running Xubuntu 14.10 with kernel 3.16.0-25-generic.</p><p>LSPCI output for wireless card:<br />03:00.0 Network controller: Intel Corporation Wireless 7260 (rev 83) with pciid of 8086:08b2</p><p>If I connect to the tp-link on 2.4ghz band (aes encryption) and do a file transfer, my rx rate shows as 130Mbit/s rx and 65Mbit/s Tx rate.&nbsp; Real world throughput is about 5.2MB/s (megaBYTE not bit) from a local ftp server<br />Same test on 5ghz shows 270Mbit/s RX, 150Mbit/s TX and real-world transfer is 11.9MB/s (megaBYTE).<br />The tp-link is in the basement on the other side of the house.&nbsp; The TP-link is in AP(WDS) mode.</p><p>the WD Mynet 750 with the same wifi settings &amp; openwrt image, as a WDS client, can connect to the tp-link on 5ghz at 300Mbit/s and real world transfer speeds are about 22MB/s (again Megabyte).&nbsp; Fantastic!</p><p>However, if I setup the 2.4ghz radio on the WD My Net N750 as a normal access point for my laptop, and I sit 1 meter away, I can&#039;t get a link better than 54Mbit/s (according to the status page on the wd-mynet).</p><p>What I&#039;d like to do is use the 5ghz as the &quot;backhaul&quot; (at 300Mbit/s) and then offer the 2.4ghz radio as an AP for client machines.&nbsp; However, I&#039;d really need more than 2.2MB/s real world speed.</p><p>Any suggestions on why I am unable to connect above g speeds on 2.4ghz on the MYNet 750?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>RobstarUSA</strong> on 7 May 2015, 03:16)</p>

					<p>I actually set it to auto....so I&#039;d hope that would &quot;just work&quot;.&nbsp; If not I&#039;ll try to find out what is least used around here.</p><p>I am pretty sure the tp-link on the basement is on auto as well. </p><p>For the time being, I&#039;ve set the 2.4ghz band to g only and am using it for some ip phones.&nbsp; That keeps them off the other 2.4ghz n access points I have.</p><p>I&#039;d really like to get at least a single 20mhz N access point/channel up, off of one of these if I can (I have another one I haven&#039;t setup yet).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>RobstarUSA</strong> on 7 May 2015, 14:27)</p>

					<p>Never count on the routers auto - it rarely picks the best channel. not sure if openwrt is any better about that. just do your own site survey and pick the least busy channel between 1, 6, and 11 (the only 3 independent channels for 2.4 GHz). If you want to use 40MHz wide channels, there better not be much competition on the 2.4 GHz band in your area.</p>									</div>
