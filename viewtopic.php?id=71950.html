					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am looking to setup a simple and secure VPN solution between 2 locations using OpenWrt.&nbsp; Here is the back story - I tried to get this working using DDWRT, but I can&#039;t seem to figure it out.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if I had an incorrect setting, or if it is a bug in the DDWRT.&nbsp; Since I have given up on this, I&#039;m thinking about trying OpenWrt instead which I have never ever used.</p><p>In each of the 2 locations, I have an existing router and it seems like the easiest solution from DDWRT was to purchase an additional router for each location to create the tunnel so that I do not need to change (or very minimal change) the config on the existing router in each location.&nbsp; I have purchased two Linksys WRT1900 (v1 and v2) to attempt to get this working.</p><p>Ultimately, I am hoping a CPE device in the secondary location to be able to connect back to the primary location and pull an IP address.</p><p>Does anyone have any guidance about using OpenWrt and also using OpenWrt to create this tunnel?</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>

					<p>First of course install OpenWrt.</p><p>This is the guide I used:<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.openvpn">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.openvpn</a></p><p>You need a TAP configuration in order to &quot;pull an IP address&quot; (DHCP) through the VPN.</p><p>For testing, connect the WAN ports of both routers to another &quot;main&quot; router that is connected to the Internet.&nbsp; That way you can simulate a connection via the &quot;Internet&quot; (actually the LAN of your main router) without actually being in different locations.</p><p>The site that is the server needs to have an ISP that allows incoming connections, and a static IP or a dynamic DNS.&nbsp; If there is another router in between the ISP and the OpenWrt OpenVPN server, port 1194 (UDP) needs to be forwarded through that router to the OpenWrt router.&nbsp; </p><p>None of the paragraph above is necessary at the client end.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 2 Sep 2017, 03:56)</p>

					<p>Thank you... let me digest and I will start working on this.&nbsp; Unfortunately I&#039;m sure I will have many questions.</p><p>PS - the server location is Comcast and the client side is CenturyLink.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, I&#039;ve got OpenWRT installed on my WRT1900ACv2.&nbsp; My first question is since I have the WAN port of the WRT1900 is plugged into one of the LAN ports of the main routers, is there a way to enable WAN http access for easy web GUI access to the WRT1900?&nbsp; Since the WAN port does not face the public internet, this should be ok.&nbsp; I see some articles about tunneling http protocol through ssh, but this seems like overkill.</p>									</div>
