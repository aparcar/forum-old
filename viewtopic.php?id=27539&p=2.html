					<p>I tried it again lately.&nbsp; The results are still the same.&nbsp; For USB drive isntallation, downloaded root-fs and uImage from trunk didn&#039;t work.&nbsp; I replaced uImage with the uImage that I compiled and it works.<br />Anybody know why?</p>									</div>

					<p>I just repeat the question again here: If I install Openwrt in Dockstar USB, my own build is fine with rootfs.tar.gz and uImage.&nbsp; However, if I install from the trunk version, rootfs is fine but it will not boot up correctly with its uImage.&nbsp; If I use my own uImage with the trunk version of rootfs, it works.&nbsp; There must be something different between uImages of the on-line trunk version and my own.&nbsp; My question is: what is the difference?&nbsp; Does anybody know?&nbsp; Or who is the person doing the nightly build so can I send this question to?</p>									</div>
