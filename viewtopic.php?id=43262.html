					<p>If you put more that 5V on WR703n you will fry it!!! Don&#039;t do it with 48V!!! WR703N doens&#039;t have input power regulator, and it expect 5V, anything more than 5.5V will fry it. You have been warned.</p>									</div>

It also varies based on cable quality, device power draw and adapter configuration. You <em>can</em> have working passive PoE at 5v over good quality cables of 10m and 15m. At 50m 12v with 5v step down works fine, which&#039;ll be easier to do than 32v.</p>									</div>

					<p>My router was at 20meters, the cable was not the best <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/lol.png" width="15" height="15" alt="lol" /> and I had to power a USB hard disk connected to the router, the power at 5 or 12V was not enough and caused random freezes or reboots.<br />The next power adapter I had was 32V (from an old printer), so I used it. And it worked <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />I used a PTN78020W from Texas instrument (Got it from free samples):<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://media.digikey.com/Photos/Texas%20Instr%20Photos/PTN7-DIP%20SERIES.JPG" alt="http://media.digikey.com/Photos/Texas%20Instr%20Photos/PTN7-DIP%20SERIES.JPG" /></span></p><p>It accepts up to 36V and can output up to 6amps.

					<p>As I say it depends heavily on the setup, resistance over longer distances determines the maximum wattage that can be delivered at a given voltage. A highly efficient router that takes 2-3 watts will work over a cable of roughly four times the length of average routers that take 8-12w. Of course if you add a USB drive then the power requirements increase further, another 2-5w for a laptop drive and 5-20w for a 3.5&quot; drive. Compared to my 3w router for example your maximum cable length could be reduced by a factor of ten. That&#039;s the main reason &quot;true&quot; PoE (802.3af) uses over 40 volts - so that it can reliably power any properly rated device over any properly rated cable of up to 100m.</p><p>Though on a side note, higher voltages are more efficient - less power is lost to the cable itself - though you have to account for losses in your downconverter.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>qasdfdsaq</strong> on 23 May 2014, 04:53)</p>
