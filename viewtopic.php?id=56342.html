					<p>hi ,</p><p>AFAIK Ubus and Mqtt are based on publish and subscribe models. <br />Is there any page where I can find comparision between both.<br />Is there any concrete reason Openwrt is using UBUS instead of some thing like mosquitto(mqtt broker) ?</p><p>Any information would be helpful and appreciated.<br />Regards.</p>									</div>

					<p>MQTT is much heavier specification with more things to implement than something custom-build just for OpenWRT like ubus. That&#039;s why ubus can be small and only contain as much as needed.</p><p>MQTT was designed to operate with unreliable networks between broker and clients, so it would work if you&#039;re very laggy and jump in and out of coverage spots. So the specification requires you be able to handle such situations on both brokers and clients. ubus on the other hand communicates over Unix sockets on the system itself, which would never run into such issues. </p><p>That said, MQTT is a great way to communicate for OpenWRT to the outside world if you need that kind of pub/sub functionality. But it would be overkill and not fit properly to run just inside one single system, it&#039;s built for networked ones.</p>									</div>
