					<p>Hi, everyone, I am totally new to openWRT and i am facing some problem which I need some guidance. I flashed my TP-Link TL-MR3220 v2.2 with OpenWrt Barrier Breaker (Bleeding Edge, r40363). I have also installed LuCI and olsrd to form a wifi mesh network. However, when I click Status--&gt; OLSR --&gt; Neighbours, I get the following screenshot. I get the same error also when I click &quot;Routes&quot;, &quot;Topology&quot;, &quot;HNA&quot;, &quot;MID&quot;, and &quot;Interfaces&quot;</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/71150695/olsrd1.JPG" alt="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/71150695/olsrd1.JPG" /></span></p><p>I am pretty sure that &quot;jsoninfo&quot; plugin is loaded, and is configured on port 9090 and accepts connections from &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;, as shown in the screenshot below.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/71150695/olsrd2.JPG" alt="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/71150695/olsrd2.JPG" /></span></p><p>Now the problem is, how do i make sure that OLSRd is running? In case it it not running, how do i activate it?</p><p>Many thanks in advance for the reply.</p>									</div>
