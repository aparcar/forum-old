					<p>Hi, I have opwnrt setup with a router setup in wireless client mode and opnevpn running, when the VPN is running all traffic is routing over the VPN unless the VPN is disconnected then all the traffic routes over my default ISP gateway, I need the openwrt system to access the main gateway and only devices connected via the lan ports to be router over the openvpn connection.</p><p>I also dont want to allow access to clients connected via the ethernet lan to the main gateway if the vpn drops.</p><p>I have tried a few methods but either everything is routed over the vpn or the default gateway</p><p>Can someone help me achieve this.</p><p>Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davie</strong> on 11 Dec 2015, 17:38)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m afraid I can&#039;t offer an OpenWrt-specific solution, but I had the same problem with a VPN running on a Linux desktop and after some hunting around the web I found this: <a href="http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=108381">http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php? â€¦ p;t=108381</a></p><p>The post by M51 at 2013-11-02 12:43 has a little shell script which I was able to tweak to suit my purposes, so it might be useful for you.</p><p>Cheers.</p><p>Steve</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>SteveF</strong> on 11 Dec 2015, 23:56)</p>
