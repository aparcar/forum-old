					<p>Hi:</p><p>I have red about an utility for modifiying the kernel command line called &quot;patch-cmdline&quot;. I need this utility because I would like to disable the console through the serial port and then connect a modem to it. I have searched for that utility but I&#039;ve found nothing. So, can anyone tell me where can I find it or other way to modify the kernel command line? I have tried using RedBoot, but doesn&#039;t work.<br />Thanks a lot.</p>									</div>

					<p>Looks like patch-cmdline was created by nbd and committed in <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/7193">r7193</a>.&nbsp; It currently is only built on the adm5120 and rb532 targets, but you could try playing around with the package makefile (and look at the respective target makefiles/patches to see how it is currently used, though it appears that it might not be used in the way that you intend to use it.)</p><p>Edit: Originally said it was created by florian, but it was only committed by him; nbd wrote patch-cmdline.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Bartman007</strong> on 22 May 2007, 14:28)</p>

					<p>Thanks a lot, Bartman007. It looks like a very simple c program, so I think there will be no difficulties for compiling in different arquitechtures.<br />The utility looks for the mark &quot;CMDLINE:&quot; in the kernel especified in the comman line and then changes its value for the desired one.<br />I hope it works for me.</p><p>Thanks a lot to all of you.</p>									</div>
