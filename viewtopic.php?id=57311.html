					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I have flashed BB on a TP-WR703N, increased available space with a USB drive and extRoot. I&#039;ve installed openVPN, configured a server and changed firewall settings as described in the Wiki pages (I&#039;ve tried each configuration, as there are various WIKIs).</p><p>I can connect to the server from outside my network, connect successfully and gain a VPN IP address in the range 10.0.0.x</p><p>With various configs, I&#039;ve been able to ping the VPN server (obviously), but only with some configs can I reach the gateway +/ other devices on the server LAN.&nbsp; At NO point have i been able to reach the internet via my VPN connection.</p><p>I feel that I&#039;m 99% of the way there and just need to fiddle with firewall rules or IPtables on the openwrt box, to push all traffic to the internet, via the gateway modem/router.</p><p><a href="https://forums.openvpn.net/topic18766.html">https://forums.openvpn.net/topic18766.html</a> this person has done exactly what I want and then gone on a stage or 2 further. I don&#039;t need a 3 hour lease, or (hopefully!) dynamic changing of config files. (S)He says </p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>The tricky bits were getting to grips with iptables and trying to understand why the firewall wouldn&#039;t initially allow forwarding in and out of the same NIC (all my previous OpenWRT/OpenVPN installations have been on multi-NIC routers),</p></blockquote></div><p> so I imagine this is my trouble - trying to do too much with one NIC?&nbsp; &nbsp;Alex, if you&#039;re out there, please get in touch - my post from a week ago is yet to appear on the openVPN forum!</p><p>A vague picture of what I&#039;m trying to acheive:</p><p>Remote machine =&gt; Internet =&gt; home broadband router(using dDNS) =&gt; openWRT VPN server (via a port forward)</p><p>Once connected I want ALL traffic from the remote machine to go via my home broadband, so that the outside world will consider me as being at home, in my lounge! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Remote machine for now is Windows 7 PC or Android mobile phone.&nbsp; With any luck, once I&#039;m up and running I&#039;ll configure another travel router to be the sole thing connecting to it, so that multiple devices can connect to its WiFi and browse as if at home.</p><p>Server config:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;openvpn&#039; &#039;lan&#039;
