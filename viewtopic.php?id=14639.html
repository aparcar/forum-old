					<p>Hi guys</p><p>first of all I&#039;m not 100% sure this is the right place for starting this thread so please if there is any other place <br />please move it!!!!</p><p>I bricked my WRT54G V2 a week ago when trying to flash the Linksys original 4.21 FW. I did click on the WIFI <br />auto connect SES and it never came back so I unplugged and finally bricked the box....</p><p>I have tried the pin shortcut method (I know that I shouldn&#039;t but I read that later) with no success however <br />when looking at the pins with a magnifying glass they look ok...</p><p>I have tried then with a Siemens ME45 Serial and an Ericsson T28 cable (based on MAX3232 IC) which <br />according to wiki should work but I never get anything from the box unless I play around shortcutting the TX <br />and RX pins... In those cases I sometimes get CFE&gt; but I cannot send any command or at least I don&#039;t get <br />any answer.... here you have the cables pinouts:</p><p><a href="http://pinouts.ru/CellularPhones-A-N/erics_t28_pinout.shtml">http://pinouts.ru/CellularPhones-A-N/er … nout.shtml</a></p><p><a href="http://www.hardwarebook.info/Siemens_C25/S25">http://www.hardwarebook.info/Siemens_C25/S25</a></p><p>As I understand the CFE through serial console should work no matter the pins are damaged or not so I must <br />be geting something from there!!!! Just for you to know I&#039;m using Hyperterminal with 115200 8N1 but I have <br />also tried with PuTTY...</p><p>Does anyone have any idea why I&#039;m not getting anything on the console?????</p><p>Many thanks in advance!!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>karmacoma</strong> on 24 Feb 2008, 15:17)</p>

					<p>Be sure &quot;Flow Control&quot; is set to NONE (I recall somewhere seeing differently).</p><p>BUT...

					<p>hi guys!!!</p><p>first of all thanks for such quick answers!!!</p><p>I have tried the ping thing several times with no success, maybe I have to do it faster <br />but having ping -t running, the cable connected and connecting the power on the box <br />never gives you any answer....</p><p>I&#039;m also wiring directly since it was faster, I would later think about installing the DB9 <br />connector. However I&#039;m wiring to the pins 1, 4, 6 and 9 since 1 and 2 are Vcc and 9 <br />and 10 GND.... According to the T28 cable pinout (see link above) and the JP1 connector <br />layout:</p><p>JP2-2 +3.3V&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;====&gt;&gt;&gt; Pin 11<br />JP2-4&nbsp; Data TO the PC&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ====&gt;&gt;&gt; Pin 5<br />JP2-6&nbsp; Data FROM the PC&nbsp; ====&gt;&gt;&gt; Pin 4<br />JP2-10 GND&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;====&gt;&gt;&gt; Pin 10</p><p>I have tried with and without flow control but no answer at all.... </p><p>As I mentioned I&#039;m using hyperterminal in my W2k laptop&nbsp; and I have also tried an <br />XP box just in case but I&#039;m not sure if the driver is good enough to handle the <br />&quot;No flow Control&quot; properly.... Shall I use a different program (I tried with Putty as <br />well).</p><p>One more thing in the V2 at least it should be JP1 since JP2 is having 12pins and I <br />understood that is for JTAG.....</p><p>When I shortcut TX and RX in the cable I sometimes get strange characters in the <br />Hyerterminal and sometimes I get CFE&gt; propmt or Invalid command or things like <br />that, for example:</p><p>InvalidÃ Ã¾Â«Ã¼Ã¾&nbsp; &nbsp;Ã¾Ã¾2@[ $[d#I&#039;</p><p>so it looks like the cable is somehow working.

					<p>Thoughts at large...</p><p>You&#039;re likely correct about JP1/JP2 - I have no experience with V2.&nbsp; Pins 1-2 and 9-10 are both +3.3V and GND respectively on my V4.</p><p>I&#039;ve never used puTTY for serial but your 115.2K/N/8/1 is verified for my V4.&nbsp; I&#039;ve used mostly Hyperterminal on Win2K and changed flash in the CFE but never loaded firmware via serial.</p><p>Touching the RX/TX together can create that jibberish all by itself.&nbsp; No surprises there.&nbsp; The router may not even have to be powered on to get that.</p><p>I must admit I&#039;ve never trusted &quot;NO FLOW CONTROL&quot; based on very very old stuff and always connected the pins I mentioned.&nbsp; This may be nothing at all.&nbsp; Those connections simply never failed for me.</p><p>From your description I&#039;m not sure what is happening.&nbsp; Maybe the adapter doesn&#039;t have power (I notice the Erickson setup steals power from any USB port).&nbsp; Maybe the adapter is driving the flow-control pins wrong (I still suggest getting them off the port and replaced with the connections above).&nbsp; Maybe connections are bad (how&#039;s your circuit skill?).</p><p>Hopefully, if there&#039;s a big difference on a V2 someone will jump in with it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Something to test if you can...</p><p>Instead of connecting to the WRT&#039;s pins 4 and 6, connect those data wires only to each other.</p><p>Now, with NO local echo in Hyperterminal, the connection should simply loop back.&nbsp; This means if Hyperterminal happens to have local echo on you SHOULD see double characters you type and it&#039;ll go away if those wires are disconnected from each other.&nbsp; If local echo is OFF then you only see the looped-back characters you type and nothing if disconnected.</p><p>If you can&#039;t get this to work then the adapter has something wrong.&nbsp; If this works fine then the focus shifts to the WRT.&nbsp; You&#039;re testing the whole data conversion both ways.</p><p>Hope I&#039;m making sense. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Also, best I can tell tracing all signals your pin connections are correct.&nbsp; The AFMS/RTS and CTS/ONREQ concerns me (CTS/RTS are flow control) and may need to simply connect together... pins 2 and 3 on the 11-pin Erickson.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Bill_MI</strong> on 25 Feb 2008, 05:43)</p>

					<p>I was thinking of connecting RTS-CTS together because, although RS-232 is well defined, you really cannot trust those names unless that interface is really really correct (some aren&#039;t).&nbsp; RS232 is funny in how ends are defined.&nbsp; One end plays modem and one plays terminal - and the PC will be terminal.&nbsp; But so many ends/chips play terminal anyway and the names get swapped.&nbsp; This long horror story started in the 1960s. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Connecting together doesn&#039;t matter which is really in and which is really out.&nbsp; RTS (RequestToSend) should be from terminal and CTS (ClearToSend) from modem.&nbsp; But the logic levels at the WRT are inverted so CTS to GND should be right (be leery of my fuzzy memory) but who knows...</p><p>The adapter will need 3.3V somehow for the echo to work.&nbsp; The WRT should is fine for that.&nbsp; And I found echo buried in Hyperterminal under Settings tab, ASCII setup - looks like default to off so loopback will reply with typed characters.</p><p>I hope something sparks it working but I don&#039;t want you to blow anything.&nbsp; Logic is pretty robust but some things may not be.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Bill_MI</strong> on 25 Feb 2008, 14:34)</p>

					<p>Hi Bill</p><p>yes I see, I was able to get the complete nvram show printout by setting the variable<br />giving problems to 0, it was &quot;sshd_hostkey&quot; so I don&#039;t think it is needed at this stage....</p><p>However I still get the same problem when booting:</p><p>Boot version: v2.3</p><p>The boot is CFE</p><br /><br /><p>mac_init(): Find mac [00:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx] in location 0</p><p>Nothing...</p><p>Reading :: Failed.: Error</p><p>I have tried to set the proper value&nbsp; (the one in the sticker) in the nvram <br />however it still doesn&#039;t work and the reset button doesn&#039;t seem to have <br />any effect on the nvram either, do you have by chance a default nvram <br />setting, I have been looking for it through the threads but no success...</p><p>The nvram command looks the same in the V2...</p><p>Do you think a JTAG cable could help better at this stage????</p><p>Thanks!!!</p>									</div>
