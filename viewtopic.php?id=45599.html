					<p>Not sure if posting in the right place, but hope someone can help. I have a dlink dsl 2780 and a huawei hg533, I am wanting to put custom firmware on them both but not sure which one is best. after looking about I am all most sure they have broadcom chipsets in them. will openwrt work on them or will I be better using something else. thank you to anyone who offers advice.</p>									</div>
