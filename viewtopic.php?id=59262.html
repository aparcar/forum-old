					<p>Hello. I wanted to use the OpenWRT firmware on my router, Edimax 6475nD, because i was unhappy with the original. Firmware update went smooth, but now i simply can&#039;t connect to the router anymore. The LED is blinking fast, so i know i&#039;m in failsafe, but there&#039;s nothing i can do to connect to it. Here is what i&#039;ve done:<br />1. Unplug and power off router<br />2. Go to IPv4 settings on pc and enter static ip 192.168.1.2 subnet 255.255.255.0 -&gt; Don&#039;t confirm yet<br />3. Power on router<br />4. When settings LED starts blinking, press reset button<br />5. When settings LED starts blinking rapidly, connect the ethernet cable from the pc to WAN port and confirm IP settings on pc.<br />6. Open putty telnet session and connect to 192.168.1.1 port 23</p><p>Putty displays an error with Connection timed out. Can anyone help me with this, please? Thank you.<br />btw, i&#039;m using win 10</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>raduleo</strong> on 28 Aug 2015, 09:57)</p>
