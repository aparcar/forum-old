					<p>Looking for some help on why my speeds are so slow hard wired and on wifi running the latest Davidc502 build on a linksys 1900ac v1. I was getting speeds on fios gigabit 940 down and 930 up using their g1100 gateway once I switched to this build using the linksys hardware the highest speeds I saw on multiple speed-test platforms where no more then 500-600 down and 300-400 up, on wifif the highest I got maybe 10 feet away was 200/150 on Davids build and&nbsp; on the g1100 i was getting on the same spot 500-600 up and 400-500 down. I am not going to sit here and lie that I am no noob when it comes to openwrt/lede then I would be lying, I have read plenty of tutorials and watched videos on how others have their routers setup most of the videos I watched on youtube are from individuals from other parts of the world that are setup running vdsl, so those configurations wouldn&#039;t help me in my situation, if you do a google search on how many people use openwrt/lede with fios you could probably find a hand full of posts, so I ask if anyone on this thread that has fios and are running Davids build, could you please chime in on how you got your speeds to reach the max fios gigabit has to offer running this build and how did you go about configuring it? Thank you, I appreciate your time and consideration. Hopefully I will get to see someone here that can guide me on what I have done wrong and how I can remedy that fault.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Timer</strong> on 25 Oct 2017, 04:59)</p>
