					<p>OK, so I tried to bridging the interface LAN and WAN in WAN interface<br />and also switching firewall zone.<br />seems to be working<br />I then tried to set the firwall zone back to wan, that maybe only bridging was needed, but it stopped working after a while.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/6RZSK6o.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/6RZSK6o.png" /></span></p><br /><p>Now I am trying to figure out if I can change the ip address of the router on the LAN cause it got 192.168.1.27 from dhcp of the modem.<br />I am not 100% sure if I should do that, but it seems that maybe if I would change protocol in &quot;Interfaces - WAN&quot;...<br />seems to be working with this settings, but I kinda feel like I dunno what I am doing, but stuff is working...</p><br /><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/TkURxLm.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/TkURxLm.png" /></span></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>DoTheEvo</strong> on 29 Jan 2016, 21:06)</p>

					<p>Since I am able to find working solution moments after asking in here on my own, I try again.<br />How do I now share files between desktop PCs and on WIFI?<br />I think I need them to be the same network?</p><p><strong>/edit</strong></p><p>ok so I googled, got some guide how to set it as <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap">dumb AP</a>, but they do stuff to LAN, I wanned to do stuff to wan<br />but I followed with the IP setting next to main router, 192.168.1.2 in wan interface if main router is 192.168.1.1<br />then it was just going in to WIFI settings and checkboxing WAN<br />and I see my desktop shares on notebooks connected through wifi</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/iaspMge.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/iaspMge.png" /></span></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>DoTheEvo</strong> on 29 Jan 2016, 21:38)</p>
