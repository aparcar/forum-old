					<p>Hello. First post.</p><p>I just installed OpenWrt on a Raspberry 2. Everything is ok but i can&#039;t get the wifi to work.</p><p>[&nbsp; &nbsp; 3.645591] usb 1-1.4: New USB device found, idVendor=0bda, idProduct=8179<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 3.654069] usb 1-1.4: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 3.662968] usb 1-1.4: Product: 802.11n WLAN NIC<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 3.669151] usb 1-1.4: Manufacturer: Realtek</p><p>I had seen old posts (from 2014) that this have not a good support. But My other Raspberry (with Recalbox) it works out of the box. So i imagine it work&#039;s now. I had installed the 8188 and 8192 but no success.</p><p>Am i doing something wrong or it&#039;s really not supported on OpenWrt?</p><p>Thank&#039;s.</p>									</div>

					<p>No tips?<br />I thought this working on Recalbox would be something good. Should i buy another dongle?<br />I will install Recalbox again and check the driver it uses.</p>									</div>
