					<p>Hello everyone, </p><p>this is my first post so please be kind. <br />I have the TP-Link WR841-N Router. With the original Firmware everything worked just fine but I wanted to give OpenWRT a shot <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>My Network Setup looks like this:</p><p>FibreCable Router --&gt; TP-Link Router --&gt; Switch --&gt; Devices</p><p>Now the FibreCable Router is connected via a normal RJ45 cable to the WAN port of the TP-Link Router. As I mentioned before my WAN / Internet Connection worked just fine, but with OpenWRT I don&#039;t seem to get a working internet connection.</p><p>In the Network overview I can see that WAN is connected but it is still in red colour?! (see picture here: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/fi2i9z1gegl6x83/Bildschirmfoto%20vom%202015-03-25%2012%3A02%3A43.png?dl=0)">https://www.dropbox.com/s/fi2i9z1gegl6x â€¦ .png?dl=0)</a><br />IP address of the FibreCable Router is 192.168.1.254, but with OpenWRT i cannot access the routers interface either (also worked with original FW)</p><p>Any ideas?!</p>									</div>

					<p>not sure(don&#039;t use Luci interface much), but it seems to be connected, see the uptime and the IP address. To telnet/ssh into it you need to connect your laptop on one of the for LAN(not blue WAN) ports on wr841.</p>									</div>

					<p>That red color is normal: OpenWrt assigns a different color to each interface, in a random fashion; as &quot;tavish&quot; pointed out, that interface is up and running fine.</p><p>Your problem is that you have two 192.168.1.0/24 networks, one on each side of the OpenWrt Router. Easiest solution is to configure your OpenWrt router to use a 192.168.0.0/24 (or any other 192.168.x.0/24 network with &quot;x&quot; different to &quot;1&quot;) network for the LAN interface. Or you can configure the FibreCable router to use another network, too.</p><p>You could also bridge the LAN and WAN interfaces together, so you effectively have one single network, but it is a bit more complex; it all depends n what you plan to do with your network.</p>									</div>
