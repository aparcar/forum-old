					<p>Hello,</p><p>sorry for my bad English, am German <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>I just bought a WNDR4300 through Amazon. As I unpacked it I saw it is version 2!<br />As written on the OpenWRT page of WNDR4300 it should be compatible.</p><p>As being no v1 the web gui denies the upgrade process by simply telling me &quot;wrong firmware&quot;.<br />So, I tried for about 10h the TFTP way.</p><p>But I seam to be too silly or whatever ...<br />I tried sth. about 30 tuts for 4300v1, 4100, 3800, 3700, ...<br />Nothing was working for that &quot;premium version&quot; (v2).<br />As I get pings back, the router doesn&#039;t want to allow TFTP requests by several tools (i.e. tftp2.exe by Netgear).<br />I tried several time slots, several reset button pressure ways, ...</p><p>As there seams to be no tut for v2 I&#039;m not sure whether anybody ever tried?<br />Netgear support says they never heard of TFTP!!!</p><p>Any suggestions?

					<p>4300v2 in probably completely different device than 4300v1. It is the sister device for wndr3700v5, which is also re-using an old device&#039;s version number, but contains a different processor etc. To my knowledge there is no support, yet. Openwrt support might be coming, but it seems to require some tweaking.</p><p>You might read these threads:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=272792#p272792">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php â€¦ 92#p272792</a><br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=56737">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=56737</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>just received a WNDR4300v2 (should receive a v1 but heh...). As I&#039;m curious and I have some tools which allows me to look inside some devices (serial cable &amp; screwdriver), I opened the case and welded to the serial port.</p><p>The case is fixed by 6 Torx-8 screws: <a href="http://postimg.org/image/7yxhsdg4j/"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://s21.postimg.org/7yxhsdg4j/IMG_20150430_091356.jpg" alt="http://s21.postimg.org/7yxhsdg4j/IMG_20150430_091356.jpg" /></span></a></p><p>When the case is opened, we can see a serial &amp; JTAG ports. The serial parameters are: 115200 8n1. Using a 3,3V TTL serial cable you can access to the serial console. Once again, it seems there is no write access (I could not type anything to the console, as if the RX pin was disabled...): <a href="http://postimg.org/image/rnyezhu47/"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://s15.postimg.org/rnyezhu47/IMG_20150430_091633.jpg" alt="http://s15.postimg.org/rnyezhu47/IMG_20150430_091633.jpg" /></span></a></p><p>Here is the back of the router: <a href="http://postimg.org/image/ni4l0ck4j/"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://s21.postimg.org/ni4l0ck4j/IMG_20150430_091729.jpg" alt="http://s21.postimg.org/ni4l0ck4j/IMG_20150430_091729.jpg" /></span></a></p><p>Finaly, I removed the 2 faraday&#039;s covers, which hide the wireless chipsets, RAM and CPU: <a href="http://postimg.org/image/lkq172ilz/"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://s15.postimg.org/lkq172ilz/IMG_20150430_104932.jpg" alt="http://s15.postimg.org/lkq172ilz/IMG_20150430_104932.jpg" /></span></a></p><p>Ok, now here is the original firmware bootlog: <a href="http://pastebin.com/rPXNFqUG">http://pastebin.com/rPXNFqUG</a><br />Fun thing, the original firmware is based on OpenWRT and is built using the WNDR4500v3 board:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Kernel command line: console=ttyS0,115200 rootfstype=squashfs board=WNDR4500v3 mtdparts=ath-nor0:256k(u-boot)ro,64k(u-boot-env)ro,64k(caldata_backup),64k(config),64k(traffic_meter),64k(pot),1408k(reserved),64k(caldata);ath-spi-nand:1152k(kernel),24448k(rootfs),25600k@0x0(firmware),2048k(language),128k(mtdoops),-(reserved)

Please be patient, while OpenWrt loads ...

Pushing the reset button does nothing.</p><p>Looking at the original firmware header, if I remember correctly, WNDR3700v4&#039;s firmware is similar: <a href="http://postimg.org/image/fwtkdo8m3/"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://s9.postimg.org/fwtkdo8m3/fw_header.jpg" alt="http://s9.postimg.org/fwtkdo8m3/fw_header.jpg" /></span></a></p><p>I don&#039;t have more information for now, and I won&#039;t be able to do extra researches, I must return this router tonight.</p>									</div>

					<p>Interesting that this is QCA956x based while the WNDR3700v5 is now Mediatek based. I would have expected them to be very similar devices like the WNDR3700v4 and WNDR4300v1.</p>									</div>
