					<p>Support for this router is apparently in trunk (development). To try it you need to download the source and build it yourself. I have no idea how usable it is yet, but I do have one I&#039;m using as a switch that I might test it out on.</p>									</div>

					<p>Can confirm it works. Have been running it on this router for the past 6 wks or so by downloading the trunk build, installing using putty or winscp, and then adding luci. Just follow the tutorials and it should work. That&#039;s what I did and trust me, I&#039;m no Linux genius. I can upload the file I used if that doesn&#039;t violate policy because I can see it isn&#039;t in the snapshot anymore. Honestly though, I think I just flashed it from dd-wrt web interface and didn&#039;t mess with tftp. Haven&#039;t had any issues or had to reset it since.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nchall</strong> on 31 Mar 2012, 11:07)</p>
