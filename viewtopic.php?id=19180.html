					<p>Most propably to reduce size - but as some people(me included) wants it - it most propably should be included in a separate package.. for e.g. samba3-nmbd</p><p>I want it for my nslu2 and I have finally been able to build openwrt under Mac OS X - unfortunately some/most of the packages refuse to build under mac os x - one of these is samba3 <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /> (and samba2 also)</p>									</div>

					<p>I tried to create samba3-nmbd extra package (depends on samba3 and contains missing nmbd) - but for some reason, when I execute it, it just exits the program without error messages in logs/syslog or on-screen, even when I set debug-level to 10 <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /></p><p>Well, that was a plenty of wasted time <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /></p><p>I also built samba-tng (with nmbd) and got it working somehow, but I unfortunately got no time for this <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /></p><p>nmbd and smbd on samba-tng project seem to work somehow (needs some patching, as it doesn&#039;t seem to allow guest logins with default config and it also refuses root login and I don&#039;t know how to create virtual users on samba-tng) _Hopefully someone will carry on from here</p><p><a href="http://www.samba-tng.org">http://www.samba-tng.org</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Actually I have now converted ALL patches that existed for previous version of samba (3.0.24) to work on 3.0.34 - still applying some other patches that fix some other problems caused by my oe.patch.. (patch suggested by openembedded - causes some duplicate code..)</p>									</div>
