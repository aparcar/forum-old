					<p>It is true that adjusting the MAKE_FLAGS, as you suggest is a more elegant solution.&nbsp; However, this only works in Kamikaze.&nbsp; In order to make the code work with White Russian, you need to redefine the whole Build/Compile directive.</p><p>Also, I recently discovered that if you are running Kamikaze, the best solution is to just install the libstdcpp package, which is unavailable for White Russian.&nbsp; If you are running Kamikaze and have the libstdcpp package installed, the above-mentioned flags are unnecessary since you can just link to the standard library.&nbsp; Therefore, it&#039;s rather important that the code listed here works in White Russian -- it&#039;s the only instance when it&#039;s really necessary!</p><p>I have updated my tutorial to reflect this simpler solution for those running Kamikaze.</p>									</div>

					<p>Just because White Russian is no longer being developed doesn&#039;t mean there aren&#039;t plenty of us still running it.&nbsp; My goal in writing this tutorial is to demonstrate how to write a SIMPLE program for OpenWrt, not how to port large complex programs or do serious development.&nbsp; I&#039;d imagine there are still people who either A) are using White Russian and want to compile small, simple programs for their own use or B) want to make sure their new package is backwards compatible.</p>									</div>

					<p>Im one of those people - I got going with my OpenWRT adventure only a week and a half ago wondering about finally getting to that home automation project, so far I&#039;ve done over a Siemens SE505, upgraded the ram to 32MB and booting off the USB Flash plus 2 USB serial adaptors and everything seems to be running very well. White Russian is the supported platform and that&#039;s fine for me as I dont need to be pioneering, I just need a stable platform to accomplish a simple application for now. Send a few X10 commands, read a few, throw a few packets over the network, send an SMS etc etc.</p><p>I did get through the SDK how to, and got it compiling but I have to admit it took me a good few hours and I havent even stopped to think about what standard libraries I might need to include and how, so its REALLY good to see this tutorial!!</p><p>Ive set up a dev machine running ubuntu and eclipse cdt, though eclipse is just working as a fancy text editor, would be nice to see a guide on getting eclipse to produce an ipkg when you hit build.</p><p>Must go and read that tutorial now, I only got as far as the last post, opened the link in the background and thought I d confess I am using white russian, getting to grips with c++ again after some years, and totally appreciating the existance of that tutorial and its backward compatibility...</p>									</div>

					<p>When ipkg exits with a return value of 4 it means that it couldn&#039;t find a valid .ipk file.&nbsp; Are you sure you properly copied the file to the router and that the file path you passed ipkg is the right one?

					<p>Some result. Tahk&#039;s to ebishop.</p><p>The src directory must not contain any compiled binary file! Remove it before do any make. </p><p>The OpenWrt-SDK-Linux-i686-1 is only for mips32 traget processors like the LinkSys WRT54xxx hardver use Broadcom processor based on MIPS32 core. So you never make executable binary for arm or ixp4 based hardver (eg. for nslu2). <br /> But if you have for example LinkSys WAG54xx or NSLU2 then you must use OpenWrt-SDK-[TargetProcessor]-[KernelVersion]-for-Linux-[HostProcessor] SDK from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org">http://downloads.openwrt.org</a> pages. Unfortunately there no compiled i686 host pocessor version only x86_64.&nbsp; This mean you need 64bit processor and linux to make package for.<br />To identify the processor of the hardware see <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware">http://wiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware</a> pages.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have once again updated my tutorial.&nbsp; I made a few minor tweaks to the first two parts including emphasizing the necessity of removing any i686 object file generated from testing locally before copying the code to the SDK directory for cross-compiling.&nbsp; I have also added a third section about how to compile your own Kamikaze SDK since, as kzsolt correctly points out above, the only binaries available for download are for the x86_64 architecture.</p>									</div>
