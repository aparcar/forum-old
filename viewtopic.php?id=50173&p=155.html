					<p>@alirz</p><p>If you have Linux running, you can have an OpenWrt image built in an hour or two with maybe 10 minutes of actual work. If you don&#039;t, you could probably find a pre-built Linux VM (Debian or whatnot) and have an image built in a bit more than that. OpenWrt is designed to be easily built, so there&#039;s no real mystery involved.</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>leitec</strong> on 27 Mar 2015, 19:37)</p>

					<p>@nitroshift</p><p>I did actually reply to you yesterday but no worries at all. I&#039;m thankful that you are helping me with this.</p><p>I would like to keep the same kernel that is in Kaloz&#039;s latest build.<br />i.e 3.18.9 . I want to make sure package compatibility is not broken with the newer kernel. Unless the newer kernel has better performance? <br />Will the image also have all the packages kalzo had in his snapshot? <br />In Any case heres a txt file with all the packages that came in Kalzo&#039;s snapshot and also including the few that installed myself. I would like to have all those in the image. I honestly dont know how much effort it is on your part to include packages in a custom build. Feel free to let me know if it takes too much time on your part and if you wouldn&#039;t want to do a custom build for me. Thanks</p><p>Full package list: <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4883446/openwrt_packages.txt">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/488 … ckages.txt</a><br />Kaloz&#039;s build: <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/people/kaloz/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/people/kaloz/</a></p><p>My custom installed packages:</p><p>luci-theme-openwrt<br />block-mount<br />python-setuptools<br />python-pip<br />ip&nbsp; (ip_3.19.0-1_mvebu.ipk)<br />openssh-sftp-server<br />postfix<br />tcpdump</p><br /><p>Any reason why so much space is reserved for /tmp and only 25MB for / ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>alirz</strong> on 27 Mar 2015, 23:15)</p>

					<p>/tmp is just that, a temporary, in-memory filesystem that is wiped when you reboot. / is on one of two rootfs partitions in the 128MB firmware, and until there is a better way to get around the dual firmware thing (that is, use all available flash space in OpenWrt without breaking compatibility with factory FW) you are sort of stuck with the smallish allocation.</p><p>Anyone could edit the dts to change the flash layout and reconfigure u-boot to boot from that instead. But that breaks compatibility with the dual firmware system and thus the factory firmware. And, of course, you always risk overwriting the bootloader if you aren&#039;t careful.</p>									</div>
