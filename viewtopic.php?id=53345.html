					<p>I am using Image Generator to build an AA-based system. It works like a charm. In order to deal with a recently surfaced problem (see <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/17839)">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/17839)</a> I had to modify a file in the Linux kernel. I managed to build a standard AA-image that fixes the problem in question (default configuration). </p><p>How do I get Image Generator to use this new, modifed kernel? The kernel source is in build_dir/linux-ar71xx_generic/linux-3.3.8 for AA. In the case of Image Generator this directory is empty. Hence, the kernel must be &quot;pre-built&quot; somewhere. But where?</p>									</div>
