Under the hood, though, router hardware varies wildly. At least for the basic configuration, you can re-use almost none of the configuration of one machine on another. This isn&#039;t anything you would have come in touch with if you only used the web interface, so I can see your idea. It just doesn&#039;t work this way.</p><p>Also, OpenWrt varies between releases.

I can see no real reason to reset before flashing other than possibly freeing memory space so the firmware would fit into temporary space. CMIIW.</p>									</div>

					<p>1. If you update the firmware image through LuCI, it already does this. LuCI checksums the uploaded image and presents it to you, along with a &quot;Proceed&quot; button. It is up to you to verify the checksum before you proceed.</p><p>2. I believe OpenWrt generally avoids touching the bootloader of a router. Which means the recovery options are limited to what the original bootloader provides. There is a <a href="https://github.com/pepe2k/u-boot_mod">u-boot modification</a> for some Atheros routers, which pretty much does what you ask for. Having a &quot;micro-firmware&quot; which is booted by the bootloader, and then boots the regular firmware or goes to a recovery mode is an interesting idea, but I don&#039;t know how such a firmware would be made more &quot;bootable-proof&quot; than the regular firmware.</p><p>3. I think the current uci config files are readable enough, but I generally reconfigure from scratch, (too much time on my hands, I suppose) so I don&#039;t know how well preserving and reusing these files work.</p><p>4. A firmware update will reset the router. From what I read in the wiki, sysupgrade preserves configuration files by appending them to the firmware image before flashing. It may be advised to do a manual reset as a precaution, to ensure that there is enough free RAM, and no applications running that may interrupt the process.</p>									</div>

					<p>seems like a great idea to include the checksum in the image as well as something that specifies which device it&#039;s for. This could then *automatically* by checked by the sysupgrade function as suggested. </p><p>It would also be nice to see the modified uboot ported to more routers</p>									</div>

					<p>Metai - seems like you are too fixated on differences - but that&#039;s why we have software -- all kinds of devices &quot;understand&quot; IP addresses, DHCP, DNS, etc, etc.&nbsp; and there are standard formats and commands for configuring Linux - from cell phones to super computers...&nbsp; If I had a customer who wanted to deploy a WRT router at 1000 locations - I&#039;d want to be able to programmatically script the configurations and setup.</p><p>In the old days, memory was &quot;tight&quot;, but today even cheap devices usually have some memory to spare, even in their EEPROMs (or whatever the technology) - if not fine - but if so - use it to good advantage!</p>									</div>

Take your simple example of &quot;its own IP address&quot;: OpenWrt runs on routers that have only one ethernet port, some even have none at all, most have multiple. The LAN ethernet port is sometimes eth0, sometimes eth0.1, sometimes eth0.2, sometimes eth1. Which interface would you apply &quot;the own IP&quot; to? And what should the system do if it doesn&#039;t understand all of your &quot;unified configuration&quot;? Apply just the ones it understands? That&#039;s very much asking for trouble.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>If I had a customer who wanted to deploy a WRT router at 1000 locations - I&#039;d want to be able to programmatically script the configurations and setup.</p></blockquote></div><p>Well, you&#039;d probably get 1000 of the same item that would take the same configuration files, wouldn&#039;t you.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>In the old days, memory was &quot;tight&quot;, but today even cheap devices usually have some memory to spare</p></blockquote></div><p>Oh, you really have no idea how tight flash memory is on embedded systems. I&#039;d wager that, even today, most of the devices OpenWrt runs on come with only 4 MB of flash memory. It&#039;s already an achievement of the OpenWrt developers to fit a somewhat-complete Linux on there.</p><p>Not saying your ideas don&#039;t make sense, they do, absolutely. It&#039;s just that you&#039;re going about it rather optimistic. OpenWrt is not your typical desktop operating system -- which don&#039;t have &quot;unified portable configuration files&quot; either, by the way.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 8 May 2014, 20:14)</p>
