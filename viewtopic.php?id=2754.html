In case of a router not having a modem attached, that&#039;d be pppoe or pptp client/server. So if you dont use those, remove them to save some tiny space. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>No. All ppp packages can be removed. That save you a lot of space on the flash.</p><p>Do this via:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/# ipkg -recursive remove *ppp*
