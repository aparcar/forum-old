					<p>Hello, in my lab we recently started playing with some OpenWrt powered radios an we tried to do a mesh configuration using the 802.11s protocol, I was looking for suggestion about ways to detect the topology. I thought about sniffing traffic at the pcap level expecting that the mac address of incoming packets would be changed to be one of the neighboring radios but I noticed that source mac addresses are preserved between hoops (I still need to double check this but I am fairly sure it&#039;s happening).</p><p>Does anyone have any better idea? Is there any way to query the network interface to obtain some sort of IDs of the radios that are in range?</p>									</div>
