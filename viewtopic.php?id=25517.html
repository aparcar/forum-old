					<p>I was hoping to move forward from using Kamikaze 8.09 on my routers to Backfire 10.03; however, I have discovered that the quagga builds are missing their ospf6d packages. It looks like whoever built the packages probably forgot to tell it to build with IPv6 or something. Would someone be kind to post a copy, or get the repository updated? Thanks.</p><p>P.S. I am also looking at the new &quot;BIRD&quot; in Snapshot, but there&#039;s reported incompatibilities between it and Quagga: probably what I&#039;m seeing today actually, since I tried to use it. Bonus points to anyone who posts a copy of BIRD for the Kamikaze 8.09 routers.</p>									</div>
