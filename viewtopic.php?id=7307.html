					<p>Ok, i&#039;m fairly technical and pretty tech savvy and have read all the docs howtos but cant get rc5 to do the &quot;right thing&quot; for my setup. Essentially i need dnsmasq to offer a DNS nameserver to DHCP clients other than the IP address of the router itself.</p><p>So what i have in my internal network is a DNS bind9 nameserver set up to do &#039;views&#039; so that depending on the internal host that&#039;s querying it. it offers different answers for hostname -&gt; IP resolution. However irrespective of any setting i can think of, OpenWRT always serves itself up as the nameserver for DHCP clients.</p><p>An example: Say my network is like so</p><p>Host A: the OpenWRT router<br />Host B: the Bind 9 nameserver<br />Host C: a Linux DHCP laptop<br />Host D: a MacOSX DHCP laptop</p><p>Now i&#039;ve set nvram_dns on A to point to B</p><p>If i bring up host C using DHCP, then its /etc/resolv.conf always gets set to host A<br />If i bring up host D the same thing happens, it sets host A as the nameserver</p><p>What config do i need to do on OpenWRT to specify that it should push host B as the nameserver ?</p><p>Help, my hair is nearly all gone... What am i doing wrong ? What have i missed ???</p>									</div>

					<p>Guys thanks a lot. That worked perfectly. </p><p>And thanks also &#039;bluesguy&#039; for pointing out that all previous changes to /etc/dnsmasq.conf are totally ignored. Which explains why a lot of my changes were ignored.</p><p>Clever idea to put a dnmasq.conf file in the distribution to give us a false sense that it&#039;s actually being used.</p><p>It&#039;d be nice to have a web interface to the DHCP page to set these values. Maybe i&#039;ll make the change..</p><p>FAQ maintainer, please put this in.</p><p>Thanks again</p>									</div>
