					<p>There&#039;s no way to know exactly... usually broadcom and atheros based sticks works well.<br />You could write down a list of the sticks you can buy to your local stores, google their model numbers to see what chipset are based on, and then check if that chipset are supported by openwrt wireless drivers!</p><p>Mattia</p>									</div>

					<p>Unfortunately you seem to be in the same state as these previous threads this year on usb wireless on kamikaze 8.09 and trunk--no substantive answers.</p><p><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=20149">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=20149</a><br /><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=20059">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=20059</a><br /><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=19520">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=19520</a><br /><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=18280">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=18280</a></p><p>Perhaps because most people using openwrt have devices which already have wireless and don&#039;t have usb, there appears to be little interest on the part of those who might know how in documenting what is needed to get wireless working on a platform like the NSLU2 or the bifferboard or the Sheevaplug or perhaps on an x86 platform.&nbsp; It would be nice to see what needs to be done or which usb sticks &quot;just work&quot;.</p>									</div>

					<p>@Strater</p><p>I looked for infos on the wifi stick you posted about. It should be based on Ralink R73 chip.<br />I took a quick look at the menuconfig of kamikaze 8.09.</p><p>This is what i found:<br />Kernel Module -&gt; Wireless Drivers -&gt; kmod-r73-usb</p><p>So... this stick *should* be supported.</p><p>Make sure your router has usb support, you will need:<br />kmod-usb-core<br />kmod-r73-usb<br />You can retrive them using opkg.</p><p>I&#039;m not 100% sure... but that stick is supported.<br />Can anyone else confirm???</p>									</div>

					<p>@AraKs</p><p>Ok, I have the stick now and it does not work. About which Kernel version do you talk? Since I have a device with broadcom WLAN I use the 2.4 Kernel. For this Kernel the package kmod-r73-usb is not available. How can I get the sourcecode and how can I compile it for my openwrt?<br />Thanks alot!</p><p>Regards<br />Strater</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Strater</strong> on 12 May 2009, 20:00)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m currently using d-link dwl-g122 on Procare eShare ES-8068 running openwrt. I just selected the modules from &quot;make kernel_menuconfig&quot; and other tools from openwrt config. Finally copied rt73.bin in place and punched:<br />iwlist wlan0 scan<br />ifconfig wlan0 up<br />iwconfig wlan0 key off<br />iwconfig wlan0 ap &lt;AP address goes here&gt;<br />iwconfig wlan0 channel 1<br />iwconfig wlan0 essid &lt;essid here&gt;<br />dhcpcd wlan0</p><p>For some reason I&#039;m having hard time making it associate with the AP but running the commands enough many times makes it work. Could be just weak signal.</p>									</div>
