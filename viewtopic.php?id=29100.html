					<p>Is there a package that would allow me to track in detail what hosts on LAN talk to which hosts on WAN? Ideally I would like to access some database where I could see something like:</p><p>on Jan 2nd, 2011 192.168.0.22 sent XXX bytes to 74.125.127.99 and received YYY bytes form there</p><p>I was thinking of either writing a perl script (if it can run fast enough) that would parse output of tcpdump and store the results in some folder from which database computer would fetch it via FTP. If perl script wasn&#039;t fast enough, I was considering writing a binary that would link to libpcap and do the same thing.</p><p>however before I set out to do that I wanted to make sure that I wasn&#039;t inventing a bicycle. Hence this post.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah... I guess I should have researched more before asking. I already see softflowd and ulogd that both suit my purposes.</p><p>Which one of these would be able to account traffic on a ~30 megabit link best?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Ghostrider</strong> on 15 Mar 2011, 11:58)</p>
