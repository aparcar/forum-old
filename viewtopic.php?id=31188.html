					<p>My ISP offers me a 100mbit fiber connection with a MTU of 1500. I read MSS clamping is only needed for low speed dsl connections with a MTU lower then 1500. So i guess i can disable this option?</p><p><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/4522">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/4522</a></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>If you have a remote site that is blocking inbound ICMP fragmentation-needed messages, that site is fairly broken anyway. Any fragmentation for any reason along the path is going to make PMTU discovery break. The connection at your end is only a small part of that path.</p><p>So in summary - no, please don&#039;t make mtu_fix the default, I don&#039;t want to pay a <strong>performance cost</strong> for the sake of of some broken ISPs and servers that I don&#039;t use anyway.</p></blockquote></div>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Alex24</strong> on 3 Aug 2011, 23:42)</p>
