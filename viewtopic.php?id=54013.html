					<p>Hi openWrt developers and all openWrt enthusiasts,</p><p>This is a question addressed to the developers of OpenWrt project. I see now that the last version of openWrt is barrier_breaker 14.07 rc3.<br />I was looking to the hardware database <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start#asus">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start#asus</a> and I did not find there the model from Asus RT-N18U with a chipset Broadcom BCM47081 and saw that it is not supported yet.</p><p>I want to ask if openWrt is in active or is intended for future development for this type of hardware platform. I also saw that dd-wrt and tomato have already this kind of support and I am little surprised that openWrt is not ready yet for this type of platforms.</p><p>I currently have an Asus Wl-500g Premium with OpenWrt - Kamikaze 7.09 and using it from more than 6 years without any problems. (except when the external power source of the main router was burned, 1-2 condensators burned, a known problem with this router model).<br />I want to upgrade now the router and want to use still open Wrt&nbsp; on it and not other software. Because OpenWrt works great and the abundance of packages.</p><p>Can you please tell me if that would be possible and when it is probable to be done ?</p><p>Thank you in advance and many thanks for your efforts on this very nice and beautiful project.<br />BR,<br />youth4ever</p>									</div>

Take for example the brcm2708&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />brcm47xx and brcm63xx platforms which are supported by OpenWrt. Why can&#039;t be done for&nbsp; BCM47081 too ?</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br />youth4ever</p>									</div>
