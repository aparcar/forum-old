					<p>Hi All,</p><p>Am looking for a solution that will allow me to connect site to site over IPSec (Azure) and then also to utilise VPN services such as Nord etc, ideally from the same router.</p><p>I must admit, I am relatively new to VPN connectivity however this is being driven by the standards that are supported by these two organisations and many others similar to Nord.</p><p>I currently have a Draytek 2860ac in place and have now had a Linksys wrt3200 arrive.</p><p>Having read around, I understand the Linksys via OpenWRT/Lede could do this, but am uncertain and before taking the plunge would welcome peoples thoughts/views/advice please?</p><p>thanks for reading</p><p>mbro</p>									</div>

					<p>Having looked into this in a little more detail on here, seems there are additional packages that can be installed that may do what I need, can anyone confirm and point in the right direction please?</p><p>thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Thats right, you can use both IPSec and OpenVPN on your router once you&#039;ve installed LEDE/OpenWrt.</p><p>For IPSec, the package you need is called strongswan. <br />Openvpn is called just that.</p><p>Do note that while it might not be as easy as clicking a few buttons on a GUI, their text configuration is easy to understand and once you&#039;ve grasped the basics you will be able to create complex setups quickly.</p><p>And there&#039;s a lot of tutorials/info online on how to set either of those up.</p>									</div>
