					<p>Hi. I&#039;ve tested Huawei&#039;s cdc driver on trunk/AR71xx. The driver seems work fine on kernel 3.3 (at least in normal situation).

					<p>Hi @cawcaw, nice howto!</p><p>I have one simple question. Lets assume that the cdc_ether driver is working and you have managed to get your dongle recognized by the router&#039;s kernel. It seems that the dongle is recognized like an ethernet device. How you setup the settings needed to connect to the mobile network (apn, user, pass, etc...)? Typically you need a modem to do a ppp dial-up session to your mobile provider&#039;s data network.</p><p>One more question, I have an android smart phone that I setup with a custom rom over a custom kernel - now the usb tethering works out of the box, Do I need the same driver as I intend to connect my phone to the USB port of the router and use it to make my 3G WAN connection via it? My linux laptop recognizes my phone tethering as an ethernet usb0 interface and I can configure it as a normal ethernet device, since the modem operations and 3g connection is done only by the phone.</p><p>Probably this driver works for the router in exactly the same manner, but in the second scenario, we have the smart phone taking care about the connection to the mobile data network, and in the case of using only the dongle on the router, you seem not to configure those parameters.</p><p>Regards,<br />dir2cas</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dir2cas</strong> on 8 Aug 2012, 10:49)</p>

					<p>Hi @marc22, thank you very much for your advice.

This device has dhcp server, dns server and web setting page also. I have to configure apn etc... at the web setting page in advance. Then I open some web page in my PC&#039;s browser, the mobile router automatically begin to connect. </p><p>I am sorry I don&#039;t know how I operate data stick with this driver. Please download the Huawei&#039;s source code and look at scripts in it. On linux desktop, they seem to use &quot;MobilePartner&quot; in order to connect. Though I don&#039;t know how it works, I think probably you can do the same by scripting. I will try when I get my stick. Please go ahead!</p>									</div>
