					<p>Hi all, although not completely OpenWRT specific, I wrote a tool to enable keyed IPSec accross a home network specifically motivated by OpenWRT. In particular, it gives things like secure access to the OpenWRT panel without setting up a self-signed key for https, as well as secure dns, secure nfs, and whatnot. Unlike other systems, it requires no SWAN or racoon style daemon to be run on any systems but does require knowing the hosts that want to communicate in advance. It sets up the kernel IPSec tables once on network boot via a shell script and never touches them again, so it requires no persistent memory or programs to be installed on your router which can be very useful on a resource constrained OpenWRT router. It needs the &#039;setkey&#039; tool from ipsec-tools and &#039;ifconfig&#039; to work though. It is not as general as public key systems, but fills a useful niche of sharing local services or accessing web config portals on your network. My scripts only work out of the box on linux and most bsd systems, but you can use the keys in the scripts with any other ipsec systems config tool of choice and it will work.</p><p>My article is at <a href="http://notanumber.net/archives/196/simple-ipsec-home-network">http://notanumber.net/archives/196/simp â€¦ me-network</a></p><h5>OpenWRT setup</h5><p>The OpenWRT tailored instructions are, for a router &#039;router&#039; and two computers &#039;cybertron&#039; and &#039;lexx&#039;</p><ul><li><p>run on a box with perl<br /><em>perl createnet.prl router cybertron lexx</em><br /></p></li><li><p>This will create the files &#039;setup_crypto_router&#039; &#039;setup_crypto_cybertron&#039; and &#039;setup_crypto_lexx&#039; and &#039;hosts_crypto&#039;. copy the lexx and cybertron files to the corresponding hosts /etc/network/if-up.d directories restarting their networking and the other two files to your router.<br /></p></li><li><p>on the router move hosts_crypto to /var/hosts/ and do a /etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart<br />run &#039;setup_crypto_router br-lan&#039; (assuming lexx and cybertron are on br-lan) on the router and you are done. <br /></p></li><li><p>Access any host via hostname.crypto and it is encrypted and authenticated.</p></li></ul><p>Now you have the hostnames &#039;lexx.crypto&#039;, &#039;cybertron.crypto&#039; and &#039;router.crypto&#039;. Any access via those names is encrypted and authenticted. so anywhere you can use a hostname, just use the crypto version and enjoy fully secure network traffic. The cryptography is point to point, so cybertron and lexx can communicate in an encrypted fashion directly. So by putting lexx.crypto in your /etc/exports file you restrict nfs to encrypted traffic only for instance. Or using <a href="http://router.crypto/">http://router.crypto/</a> to access luci. The normal IP addresses, hostnames, and networking is not affected so an improper ipsec setup won&#039;t hurt reachability or debugability, the crypto names are on a new generated ULA network that is orthogonal to other systems.</p><p>The system is very secure, a host compromise will only allow impersonating that host, each setup file only contains only the keys relevant to that host. The master key is destroyed after creating all the setup files. The main difference between it and PKI schemes is that it uses a persistent symmetric key as opposed to a persistent asymmetric key, which isn&#039;t an issue if you choose the proper ipsec encryption modes. It is similar to kerberos in that sense. The extra paranoid can occasionally rekey by re-running the script and distributing the new setup files.</p><p>on the router you want to arrange for the setup_crypto_router br-lan to be run on network up, not sure the best place to do it in openwrt, i put it in a cron job but perhaps someone can recommend somewhere better or a direct translation of the key setup to uci /etc/config which i can put in my script to autogenerate.</p><p>In any case, it won&#039;t be applicable to everyone, but it fills a useful niche for many. Especially if you use nfs. I think this could be an excellent general addition to OpenWRT for secure access to the web portal rather than https for some.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jwm</strong> on 17 Nov 2014, 00:49)</p>
