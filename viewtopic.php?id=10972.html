					<p>I have a new Linksys WRTSL54GS and am experiencing extremely poor signal strength.&nbsp; With my laptop right next to the router I don&#039;t get above 60-70% as reported by NetworkManager.&nbsp; It drops to about 25-30%&nbsp; and I lose connection if I move more than about 15 feet away.&nbsp; Part of the problem, I think, is that the driver for my broadcom 4318 chipset in the laptop still has some proplems.&nbsp; But I had full coverage of my apartment with my WRT54GL, so there is definitely a big difference between the routers.&nbsp; The WRTSL54GS only has one antenna, and it is, to my knowledge, not removeable, so I can&#039;t switch to a high gain antenna.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure what information would be most useful, but I&#039;m including the output of &#039;iwconfig eth2&#039; for reference.&nbsp; This is just after a reboot.&nbsp; If more info is needed, just ask.</p><p>And a big thanks to the devs.&nbsp; I&#039;ve deployed 8 OpenWRT routers in the last couple of months and I must say that OpenWRT is the coolest thing I&#039;ve had the pleasure to work with in a long time!</p><p>Thanks,<br />Steve</p><p>==========<br />eth2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IEEE 802.11-DS&nbsp; ESSID:&quot;atlantia2&quot;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mode:Master&nbsp; Frequency:2.412 GHz&nbsp; Access Point: 00:10:18:90:20:DB&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tx-Power:18 dBm&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RTS thr=2347 B&nbsp; &nbsp;Fragment thr=2346 B&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Encryption key:off<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Link Noise level:-12 dBm<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rx invalid nwid:0&nbsp; Rx invalid crypt:0&nbsp; Rx invalid frag:0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tx excessive retries:0&nbsp; Invalid misc:0&nbsp; &nbsp;Missed beacon:0</p>									</div>

					<p>I have several WRTSL54GS units running OpenWRT v0.9 and the signal is fine for much longer distances than 15 feet.&nbsp; The SL does have an inferior radio than the GL, but not THAT much worse, it&#039;s just missing the onboard amp.&nbsp; You should get at least 80-90% the range of a GL unit.&nbsp; You can de-solder the existing antenna and add an RP-TNC connector if you want options of a better antenna, it&#039;s not that difficult.</p><p>I would suggest you look at the obvious problems, perhaps interference, defective antenna solder joint, or client issues.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 1 Jun 2007, 23:02)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the help.&nbsp; I can&#039;t find anything obviously wrong.&nbsp; I thought the bcm43xx driver for the broadcom chip in my laptop might have been part of the problem.&nbsp; But I tried ndiswrapper, which is supposed to work well, and see the same results.&nbsp; Also, I see APs from surrounding apartments where I live with stronger signals than from the WRTSL54GS ten feet away!&nbsp; I&#039;ve already opened the case and torn the &quot;warranty voided&quot; sticker, so I guess I&#039;m stuck.</p><p>I think I&#039;ll buy another WRT54GL to do the wireless and just use the WRTSL54GS as a file server.&nbsp; On the whole, the WRT54GL seems like higher quality equipment.</p><p>BTW, I get about 10mb/s transfer to/from my USB drive (LaCie 250GB USB 2.0) locally on the router, and only about 2MB/sec over samba via a 100mbit wired connection.&nbsp; A little more (2.5mb/sec) using the userspace nfs server.</p><p>The nfs server and samba server processor usage seem to be the bottleneck.</p><p>Is this in line with what you have observed?&nbsp; I was hoping for a little better transfer rate.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Steve</p>									</div>
