					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to setup a bluetooth audio sink on my router with the current trunk. Searched the forum but still do not have a clean picture how to do that.

					<p>I am also looking forward to this since a long time ago, but everybody says that OpenWRT Bluetooth support is kinda poor and broken.<br />I have already got a working setup with Shairport for audio streaming over Wi-Fi using an USB sound card with Toslink Optical output, I was hoping to get also Bluetooth A2DP audio receiving support. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>

Set the class ID of your bt dongle to headset profile (using hciconfig of bluez)<br />2. Open a rfcomm connection to the bt device address and channel of A2DP (using sdptool to know what is the channel of AD2P of your device).<br />3. Send the commands AT in the rfcomm connection to active a SCO channel (see the AT commands in the bluetooth official website).<br />4. Open a bluetooth SCO connection.<br />5. Poll both connections in the c program and send the data you get by SCO to a audio sink (the data is received in PCM RAW audio format).</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />Is there a requirement of installing pulseaudio-bluetooth package for using A2DP profile as source and sink? Also if anybody could provide some information on enabling A2DP source and sink on openwrt with bluez, it would be highly appreciated.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
