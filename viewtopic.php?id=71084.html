(Cake supports a number of diffserv profiles that all attempt to do the right thing with packets marked as latency sensitive according to the relevant RFCs (see e.g. <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4594.txt">https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4594.txt</a>), with the exception of the &quot;besteffort&quot; profile). The challenge typically is to make sure incoing packets are marked appropriately, as ISPs are free to re-ap the DSCP field of packets during transfer for their own traffic management purposes. (DSCP markings are unfortunately not guaranteed to be end2end, even though a number of ISPs seem to leave them alone). <br />TL;DR. Try layer_cake.qos instead of piece_of_cake.qos and look at <a href="https://lede-project.org/docs/howto/sqm">https://lede-project.org/docs/howto/sqm</a> for detailed configuration information to make sqm-scripts/cake sign and dance...</p>									</div>

You can test this by running a packet capture on your router while initiating, performing, and shutting-down a call from your phone, that should allow you to easily confirm whether your ATA uses diffserv markings or not. For example mine marks all outgoing packets EF and my ISP lets the incoming EF marks intact (which is not so unexpected giving that I connect to my ISP&#039;s VoIP servers).<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>encore2097 wrote:</cite><blockquote><br /><div class="quotebox"><cite>moeller0 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>(DSCP markings are unfortunately not guaranteed to be end2end, even though a number of ISPs seem to leave them alone).</p></blockquote></div><p>The ISP will do their own QoS <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" />&nbsp; <br />I can only control what happens in my network.</p></blockquote></div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I guess they will use their own QoS and that is the reason why the DSCP field can not simply be trusted without checking actual traffic first. That said, a at least my ISP mostly ignores the DSCP fields, as on the last mile they use a VLAN and use that VLANs PCP for their prioritization needs while their backbone currently seems to use MPLS, allowing them to simply ignore the DSCP field.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>encore2097 wrote:</cite><blockquote><br /><br /><div class="quotebox"><cite>moeller0 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>TL;DR.

And assuming your ATA has its own IP address, per-host-isolation will already help that say your torrent host will have a harder time crowding the VoIP packets out; remember the default is per-flow fairness, so that might be &gt;20 torrent flows versus a single VoIP flow (I assume you only have one concurrent VoIP stream planned). But again the proof is in the pudding, if you test it and it does not work you might have wasted say 15 minutes at worst.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>encore2097 wrote:</cite><blockquote><br /><div class="quotebox"><cite>trismo wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Here a little help for your VoIP device software the value you need for it. <br />RTP Traffic / Voice<br />EF DiffServ decimal: 184<br />EF DiffServ hexadecimal: 0xb8<br />EF DiffServ binary: 10111000<br />EF DSCP decimal: 46<br />EF DSCP hexadecimal: 0x2e<br />EF DSCP binary: 101110<br />For SIP: calling<br />VA DiffServ decimal: 176<br />VA DiffServ hexadecimal: 0xb0 <br />VA DiffServ binary: 10110000<br />VA DSCP decimal: 44<br />VA DSCP hexadecimal: 0x2C<br />VA DSCP binary: 101100</p></blockquote></div><p>I have no where to put this but thanks.

One of sqm-script&#039;s goal is to be the &quot;AQM/QoS system for the rest of us&quot; that should do the right thing out of the box without in-depth tweaking required.</p><p>Best Regards</p>									</div>
