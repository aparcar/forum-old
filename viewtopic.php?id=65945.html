					<p>I had to replace my old router, so I decided to go for Raspberry and OpenWRT on it. I use LTE (cellular) as WAN via E3372 HiLink modem. I installed OpenWRT without any problems. I added WAN based on eth1 from modem. everything is working perfectly so far. then I wanted to return using one of popular VPN providers. and this is a total dead-end. I tried instructions this provider gives for OpenWRT. to create PPTP tunnel. everything from regular OpenWRT GUI. very nice. very easy. all configuration went perfectly. however - nothing happens. and I mean literally - nothing. PPTP tunel (although listed in interfaces) is not opening. I asked this provider for some help, but the only thing they could check is that from my account there was not even a single attempt for past few days. so it&#039;s not that I typed wrong password or something. system is not even trying to start this connection. then I tried OpenVPN. and this is a bloodbath. I found at least dozen of different tutorials. every single one different. many doesn&#039;t fit CC 15.05 (designated components not available to install at all). but some do. and I follow each in details. however - total failure on every attempt. either OpenVPN doesn&#039;t start at all. or it starts but show some idiotic error about &quot;server IP not responding to ping&quot; while I can ping that server easily from shell. every attempt with OpenVPN I made on a freshly installed image. so never leftovers from previous failures. does anyone ever succeeded with any VPN protocol (I can use any : PPTP, OpenVPN, L2TP, SSTP...) on CC 15.05?</p><p>Regards,<br />Vojtek</p>									</div>

So, the answer is yes, it works for the rest or us.</p>									</div>
