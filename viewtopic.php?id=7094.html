					<p>Is it possible to (real)boot Debian using openwrt? Here is what I have done:</p><p>I have WL-500GX, 1GB usb memory stick. On PC I did</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>debootstrap --foreign --arch mipsel sarge /mnt/usb</code></pre></div><p>(!I&#039;m not copypasting this, there may be mistakes, but all the process went on without any significant errors - this code is just to give idea of process)</p><p>I mounted memory stick into WL then and</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>chroot /mnt/disc0_1 sh
/debootstrap/debootstrap --second-stage</code></pre></div><p>As I said, everything went on without errors and after apt-setup and installing some utilities I believe I have basic (although not fully functional) Debian instalation which I can use after chroot.</p><p>Here comes the question. As it is described here:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/UsbStorageHowto#head-4d459de735f85dda1449558f134e95a50d94382a">http://wiki.openwrt.org/UsbStorageHowto â€¦ a50d94382a</a><br />one can easily boot from usb device. Is it possible to exec Debian init instead of OpenWRT one? Or better formulated, wil it bring the router to a working state? As I don&#039;t see inside, I don&#039;t know what can I expect and since nobody stated this question here although I think it&#039;s very straight, it may be total rubbish, but I had to ask.</p><p>I have my router mostly for testing purposes so I would like to run Debian to use all it&#039;s packages playing with http/xxxsql/ipv6 programs and settings and so on, which would be more complicated with only openwrt.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>calavera</strong> on 28 Aug 2006, 14:02)</p>

					<p>The concept of a preinit, or one init routine launching another init routine is pretty well illustrated by the usb storage howto. The only real difference is that it runs &quot;exec /bin/busybox init&quot; instead of running /sbin/init directly (which could lead to a loop if the pivot failed)</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for your answer. I think I will give it a try. In fact I had the exact idea HOW to do it (like you wrote - exec debian intit instead of busybox), but I was not sure, IF I can do it. For example ssh. I suppose that when I use debian init, there will be no dropbear ssh (started by openwrt) so I need to have ssh server prepared and configured in the debian distro (which is not by default). That is one thing that could cause some troubles. I was asking about such things - what should I set up before I do pivot_root. In other words, what is done during openwrt init (and not in debian by default), that is necessary for basic function of a router. I hope i made myself clear, I&#039;m not native English speaker, sorry.</p><p>Anyway since you didn&#039;t tell any objections, I consider it generaly a good idea to exec debian init. That&#039;s enough for me to start testing. I hope I will manage to have full debian server with openwrt kernel in the end. I think it&#039;s a good combination, isn&#039;t it (not regarding the speed:-)?</p>									</div>

					<p>Debian and OpenWrt serve two entirely different purposes; I have no idea what your goals are.</p><p>It&#039;ll just switch the root device and start Debian, it would only start OpenWrt if the pivot failed -- assuming you wrote your init script properly. If you didn&#039;t write your init script properly you could always reflash OpenWrt or stick the USB stick into another machine and try to fix the mess. I have no intentions of providing detailed support.</p>									</div>

Its a waste of time and very slow though (I have done it but on a wgt634u)<br />That will give you a full debian install though (openwrt is not there at all)</p><p>Maybe netbsd would be interesting on one of those devices but debian is too slow to be of use.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve read that, it was an inspiration for me. I chose the init way because I&#039;m to scared to play with cfe. But since I&#039;m not able to get my wl500gx visible on the lan (although booting seems to be ok), I&#039;m working on a serial console now so I can open a console session without any net at all. It would take a long time to find errors without it.</p><p>I&#039;m interested in your experience with the speed of Debian. What do you exactly mean by saying that it&#039;s slow? My router only routes my notebook and my friends pc to 512kb internet so it&#039;s more attractive for me to have full linux box (I&#039;m working on win) ready all the time instead of insisting on high troughtput. But if you confirm that Debian is useless for usual work via ssh because of speed, I&#039;m not interested in Debian at all.
