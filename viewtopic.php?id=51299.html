					<p>Hi, I have a router (TP-Link TL-R470T+ v2.1) and I want to know if it works with OpenWRT. (i have not found it on the supported devices wiki). The product page isn&#039;t very useful[0] and I can not find chipset details.</p><p>Is there a simple and safe way to know if this piece of hardware supports OpenWRT?</p><p>0: <a href="http://www.tp-link.us/products/details/?model=TL-R470T%2B#spec">http://www.tp-link.us/products/details/ … 0T%2B#spec</a></p>									</div>

					<p>The chipset is QCA9533 (Atheros). Another router with the same board (TL-WR841N) appears to have support. I haven&#039;t tried flashing mine yet as I&#039;ve been unable to get the serial connection to work and don&#039;t want to brick my router without a way back. It looks like people have had to add pull-up resistors to the TL-WR841N to get serial working. I&#039;ve tried that, but it&#039;s still not ... connecty. TP-Link may have done something tricky to disable serial that needs to be worked around. If anyone has any other suggestions, please speak up.</p><p>Here&#039;s a look at the PCB:</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i1018.photobucket.com/albums/af308/diepiapaopolopo/IMG_2360_zps0fcee3e0.jpg" alt="http://i1018.photobucket.com/albums/af308/diepiapaopolopo/IMG_2360_zps0fcee3e0.jpg" /></span></p>									</div>

					<p>@carrapato</p><p>Yeah, I soldered those headers onto the serial pads myself. I&#039;ve got a few USB-UARTs lying around, too.

					<p>It looks like your RX (Presumably) line dies at R157, take a look at that. </p><p>Other than that, i really recommend you to get a 3,3v capable UART converter, as the underlying logic at the processor is probably 1,8v / 2,5v mixed, and then scaled to 3v3.<br /> It is my experience that those things don&#039;t like 5V signalling, nor resistor-dividers, as they tend to make the edges of the signals &quot;rounder.<br />Bottomline: there are already enough cows in that bus, get a trustable UART on your side of it.</p><br /><p>I used to have the MAX232 homebrew thing, never let me off hand, until i switched to a RS232-less PC. <br />Then i needed a USB-UART thing, and none ever worked as they should.</p><p>Get an original FTDI one, most others have buggy drivers, or are chinese scam 8081. </p><p>don&#039;t even bother if you have one that has the chip-on-board with that epoxy blob. those make you scratch your head more often than actually communicate.</p><br /><p>Slightly off-topic:&nbsp; I was thinking of getting one of those things [r470+/r480+] to play with, but i got a shipment of rb750&#039;s, and for $40 they do kinda make hell freeze over (if you just want the routing, not the troughpout).</p><p>How bad is the factory firmware? Does that load-ballancing thing work propperly? <br />As a paperweight, is it usefull enough having, or it is too-light even to be a paperweight?</p><br /><br /><p>Edit:</p><p>Can you try to take a Hi-Res picture from the traces between the CPU and the headers? <br />Taking a look at the bottom of the PCB might prove usefull.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>carrapato</strong> on 29 Oct 2014, 04:56)</p>

					<p>Thanks, I&#039;ll look into a FTDI device.</p><p>I saw that R157 gap, too. That could be to make the serial read-only (if I ever get read working :-p).</p><p>The factory firmware on the r470t is pretty lousy. Port forwarding doesn&#039;t work (I found others complaining of the same thing online) and there&#039;s no IPv6. The translation from (I assume) chinese leaves a bit to be desired. Headings don&#039;t really help find some of the bits of functionality one might look for. I haven&#039;t tried the dual WAN feature yet. The metal case is awesome--nice and heavy. The power supply (someone else already ridiculed it slightly) makes a soft hum when the thing is plugged in, but it&#039;s really only noticeable when the case is open. The case is easy to open--two screws that aren&#039;t hidden by rubber feet or anything. The whole thing feels nice and sturdy. The internal hardware seems like it would be pretty capable, too, if it wasn&#039;t held back by the lousy firmware.</p><p>Here&#039;s a better image of the PCB. You should be able to zoom in a long way:<br /><a href="http://s1018.photobucket.com/user/diepiapaopolopo/media/FullSizeRender_zpsdf85a6d2.jpg.html"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i1018.photobucket.com/albums/af308/diepiapaopolopo/FullSizeRender_zpsdf85a6d2.jpg" alt="http://i1018.photobucket.com/albums/af308/diepiapaopolopo/FullSizeRender_zpsdf85a6d2.jpg" /></span></a></p>									</div>

					<p>After following someone&#039;s advice, I got the serial connection working (read and write). Pins are (starting at JP1):</p><p>TX<br />RX<br />GND<br />VCC</p><p>I had to solder bridge R157 and R169. Finally, I currently have to disconnect TX (JP1) while powering on the router and hitting any key repeatedly. Once u-boot drops to a command prompt, I can reconnect TX and have two-way communication with u-boot. I&#039;m not sure, but the have-to-disconnect-tx-on-boot thing might be due to the solder bridge (instead of an actual resistor) on R157 (leads to TX).</p><p>printenv gives the following output (watch the breaks on the long lines):</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ath&gt; printenv
