					<p>Seems that I too have bricked my 634U. I had Openwgt installed, something went wrong when updating the package list - don&#039;t ask me what, but afterwards there was nearly nothing left on the mounted partitions...<br />Since then, I have cut up two mobile phone data cables (one serial and one USB) and get no response when connecting with ms hyperterm, minicom or screen. I have wired the cables as described on nomis, sarwiki et al., set the parameters to 115200 8N1, no or software flow control - nothing.<br />In addition, I noticed that there is a voltage of about 3.3 volt on both the RX _and_ the TX pin of the wgt&#039;s serial port. Can somebody please confirm whether this is normal? Besides, does anybody have any idea what I might have done wrong and what else I could try to get a serial console?</p><p>Grateful for every hint,<br />Markus</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Maf.</p><p>Seems like you did an ipkg upgrade with an old firmware. It results with a very beautiful Kernel Panic <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> Ya I know, it&#039;s not only the kernel who panics but you too (I was into the same position about 2 weeks ago).</p><p>If you have the chance to obtain an official Siemens C55 datacable, cut it off. There is like 7 wires inside it.</p><p>Go to the link below to find the pinouts :</p><p><a href="http://pinouts.ru/data/siemens_c55_pinout.shtml">http://pinouts.ru/data/siemens_c55_pinout.shtml</a></p><br /><p>Here are the interesting ones :</p><p>Vcc = Red<br />Tx = Black<br />Rx = Orange<br />Gnd = Brown</p><p>Hope this will help you.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi givemelove,</p><p>thanks for the tips. I am not sure what did it in the end, but resetting the wgt634U by holding down the reset button for two minutes - first while running and then directly before connecting the power - and letting it rest on my desk while looking for an asus wl-500g deluxe on the net <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> seems to have worked. I haven&#039;t changed my cable wiring or minicom settings or anything - but I finally got the CFE <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />It&#039;s still weird, but at least it works again and I&#039;m currently (a) happy and (b) in the process of compiling openWRT...</p><p>thanks again,<br />Markus</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>maf</strong> on 14 Apr 2006, 19:48)</p>
