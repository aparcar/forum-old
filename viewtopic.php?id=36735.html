					<p>Hi All.<br />This is my first post on this forum :-)</p><p>The documentations says that v3.x is supported by Backfire 10.03.1 and firmware can be flashed via the OEM WebInterface.</p><p>Well, I&#039;m having problem with that</p><p>This is the error message I get when trying to flash from my standard webinterface:<br />Error code: 18005<br />Upgrade unsuccessfully because the version of the upgraded file was incorrect. Please check the file name.</p><p>I flashed successfully from stock firmware to dd-wrt and back, but no luck with openWRT</p><p>ps<br />I had the same error message with my TL-WR741ND v2.4 but I tricked it by flashing gargoyle first, and then openWRT after that</p><p>I have also a serial-TTL up and working against my TL-WR741ND v2.4 but was hoping to avoid that on my TL-WR941ND v3.6</p><p>-=Ketil=-</p>									</div>
