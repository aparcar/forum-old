					<p>So now that snapshots are mostly up, the /snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/generic is still missing. There&#039;s /snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/nand with at least some content, but there&#039;s no generic for ar71xx.</p>									</div>

					<p>Wait some 10-12 hours. <br />There is currently an ongoing ar71xx build at buildbot that has good chances to succeed. Finally.&nbsp; <br /><a href="http://buildbot.openwrt.org:8010/builders/ar71xx/builds/185">http://buildbot.openwrt.org:8010/builde â€¦ builds/185</a></p><p>After buildbot was enabled a few days ago there were first difficulties with uploading (and two successful ar71xx builds were wasted) and then with free disk space at some buildslaves. Devs have since then tweaked buildbot, and right now it looks good. Yesterday morning only a few platforms had new snapshots, while now maybe 3/4 are already available.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 9 Mar 2016, 10:33)</p>
