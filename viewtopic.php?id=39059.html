					<p>Hi all.</p><p>I have flashed my TL1034ND a few times before. This time i have a problem i flashed it the usual way by uploading the bin file to the tmp folder then installing, all seemed good until the router rebooted after the reboot all i have is the power LED i can plug in my WAN and LAN and i can still get access to internet (seems to be in a bridge mode) but no SYS light comes on only for a brief moment during start up when all LED&#039;s are on.</p><p>I have tried Fail safe - didn&#039;t work<br />Tried 30/30/30 didn&#039;t work<br />I have also tried to use a network stiffer to see if there was any packets being sent from the router and no luck there.</p><p>Is this router recoverable?</p><p>Thanks </p><p>Lee.</p>									</div>

					<p>you can try to recover it trough tftp or connecting it to rs232, for rs232 you do need the level shifter mentioned in the tutorial</p><p>tftp:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.flashing.tftp">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.flashing.tftp</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd#oem.installation.using.the.tftp.and.rs232.method">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl- â€¦ 232.method</a></p><p>rs232:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/port.serial">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/port.serial</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd#serial">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd#serial</a></p><p>edit:<br />Well this is interesting, I managed to brick my own 1043ND <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /><br />This forced me to read the docu a bit better, and it seems that you need the rs232 to download a image trough tftp.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>FriedZombie</strong> on 29 Apr 2013, 19:36)</p>
