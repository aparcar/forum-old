					<p><strong>SOLVED!</strong><br /><strong>I can get the conenction working by saying OpenWRT <span class="bbu">not to define a default route on the 3G interface</span>.</strong><br />At the moment I have no idea why this triggers the issue, but I think it&#039;s related to the fact that in my setup I already have a working WAN, which is PPPOE over eth0.2 (aka WAN) interface.<br />Also this connection is done with PPPD.<br />Which is started with this command line:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/usr/sbin/pppd plugin rp-pppoe.so mtu 1492 mru 1492 persist defaultroute replacedefaultroute user username password password ipparam &quot;wanifname pppoe-wan&quot; nodetach nic-eth0.2</code></pre></div><p>(seen in /proc/&lt;ppp pid&gt;/cmdline).<br />It&#039;s also possible that the multiwan package I&#039;ve installed was interefering. But now I need to better understand how it works.<br />In the end I&#039;ll update both the multiwan wiki page and the usb 3g dongle one.</p>									</div>

					<p>This is my current situation.</p><p>First of all it seems you need to reboot the box once you have connected everything (especially the 3g USB dongle) and after every change to the wan or multiwan configuration.<br />Failing to do so can lead to a non working box.<br />This is just annoying as once the configuration is in place you&#039;d not need reboots any more.</p><p>In Network--&gt;Interfaces I can see both WANs (xDSL pppoe, 3g ppp) as up and running as well as the traffic going through both interfaces.<br />I have opened 2 web pages: <a href="http://whatismyip.org">http://whatismyip.org</a>/ and <a href="http://www.ripe.net">http://www.ripe.net</a>/.<br />If I refresh both I often can see two different IPs. This should mean that I am balancing the load. Good!</p><p>In Status--&gt;Overview I am experiencing a major glitch.<br />I can see only one WAN instead of two while on the CLI I can see two default routes, one for each interface (pppoe-wan and 3g-wan).<br />The choice seems to be at random or it could be that only the first one to come up is shown. This is just an annoyance, though.</p><p>I&#039;ve simulated a pppoe disconnection by disconnecting the DSL cable from the modem.<br />From the Status--&gt;Overview I&#039;ve seen that interface going from OK to Failing to KO.<br />But once the cable has been reconnected the interface was still labelled as KO.<br />The Network--&gt;Interfaces was showing the pppoe was actually back, but the multiwan daemon was failing to recognize this situation.<br />A restart of the multiwan by CLI brought the situation back to normal.</p><p>Now:<br />- supposing the DNSs are ping-able is a hard assumption in general;<br />- ICMP pings over a 3G network could not work [<strong>a few 3G operator only allow UDP:53 and TCP&lt;1024</strong>];<br />- if you want to use DNSs for link checks, then you&#039;d better use them as DNSs (nslookup, dig or even netcat), not as ICMP tagets;<br />- there could be some bug in the &quot;link recovery&quot; procedure.</p><p>Finally, it&#039;s not clear to me how to configure a &quot;main link with backup&quot;, which is the final objective I&#039;m heading to.<br />Anyone had this working?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>uqbar</strong> on 23 Jan 2012, 09:53)</p>
