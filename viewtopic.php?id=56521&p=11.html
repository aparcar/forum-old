As I understand it NOR storage very rarely has errors and allow for some simple Flash filesystems, typically used with OpenWrt. NAND on the other hand usually has errors and (therefor?) works better with normal filesystems, like ext4. NOR are usually small (&lt;32MB) while NAND are usually big (&gt;32MB). I understand that anyone who wants to build support for a device, or someone who builds a custom image needs to know if it is NOR or NAND. But for the rest of us, who anyway mostly install prebuilt images from Stable (or trunk), we just focus on getting the right image. Of course, where I am going with this: should we eliminate NAND from the Flash column and make sure it is available in the device detail pages? NAND has anyway not been used consistently before, and there are definitely NAND devices that do not say NAND today.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zo0ok</strong> on 7 May 2015, 01:10)</p>

If I were to count buttons on my router, I think it has a power button and a button to enable/disable wifi. Do these include in the count? Why?

					<p>A wacky thought: </p><p>I have always wanted the ToH to keep the header of a particular model&#039;s router visible at the top of the page while scrolling (until you get to the bottom of that table). This would make it easier to keep track of what&#039;s in each of the many, many columns in the ToH. See for example, <a href="http://borgboyone.github.io/jquery-ui-table/">http://borgboyone.github.io/jquery-ui-table/</a></p><p>I am *not* asking that we do this now. It&#039;s hardly vital to our quest to make excellent info available through the ToH. Nor am I recommending that we use that particular jquery-ui-table gizmo - I simply provide it as an example of what I want to see.</p><p>But since we&#039;re tweaking the form of the underlying &lt;table&gt; ... &lt;thead&gt; ... &lt;tbody&gt; structure, I want to ask if we have encoded enough information/tagging/etc into the automatically generated HTML to make the &quot;fixed header/scrolling table body&quot; possible in the future.</p>									</div>

					<p><strong>A terminology question:</strong> As I write about the improvements we are making, I am struggling with what to call the various important bits. It will help new people be more comfortable if we always use a single name for each concept going forward. I wonder about:</p><ol class="decimal"><li><p><strong>Table of Hardware vs Supported Devices vs ?</strong> We have been calling it the Table of Hardware, yet the wiki home page has a link to &quot;Supported Devices&quot;. </p></li><li><p><strong>Device Page vs Device Details vs Router Page vs ?</strong> The individual page that gives information specific to each router/model/etc. </p></li><li><p><strong>Hardware Highlights vs dataset vs dataentry vs datatable vs Hardware Table vs Table created with data plugin</strong> By this, I mean the chunk of structured text where people who maintain the &quot;Device Page&quot; fill in the specific details. This item will be scanned to fill in the &quot;ToH&quot; automatically.&nbsp; </p></li><li><p><strong>Other names...</strong> Do we also need to come up with (separate) names for the various tables generated from that structured data? (@tmo26 has many examples at <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=275620#p275620">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 20#p275620</a>)</p></li><li><p><strong>Anything else... ?</strong> </p></li></ol><p>I have these preferences:<br/></p><ol class="decimal"><li><p>I like &quot;Table of Hardware&quot; as the public name.</p></li><li><p>I slightly prefer &quot;Router Page&quot; as the public name. </p></li><li><p>During development, I think we have called it the &quot;dataentry&quot;, but that&#039;s exceedingly generic. I would prefer a more specific name, perhaps &quot;routerdata&quot; since it is relatively unique/searchable. It would also double as the public name - &quot;Router Data&quot; in the heading of the block</p></li><li><p>?</p></li><li><p>?</p></li></ol>									</div>

					<p>1) I like toh too. (and I also don&#039;t have a better proposal)<br/>2) &quot;Device page&quot;, since not all devices are routers.<br/>3) &quot;dataentry&quot;, since this creates a direct relation to how this is shown in the sourcecode. Easily recognizeable for the one who edits it. Not all devices are routers, hence &quot;routerdata&quot; doesn&#039;t always fit.</p><p>Reminder regarding placement of the dataentry: While it is absolutely possible to put the dataentry on the device page (top, bottom, somwhere inbetween: doesn&#039;t matter), I&#039;d advise to put it on a separate page, possibly in a separate namespace (e.g. <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/hwdata).">http://wiki.openwrt.org/hwdata).</a></p><p>Reasons:<br/>3.1) Device pages sometimes describe several HW versions of a device, but only one dataentry section is allowed per page. You can add more than one, but only the last one will be the active one.<br/>=&gt; Different HW versions of a device need different pages with dataentries<br/>=&gt; Put dataentry on separate page, not on the device page<br/>3.2) For tryouts and also final implementation, it&#039;s way easier to plug in a whole directory with dataentry pages (and maybe after tryout simply remove the complete directory again), instead of editing each device page and adding the dataentry block there.</p><p>4) The device template <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/meta/template_device">http://wiki.openwrt.org/meta/template_device</a> calls this section &quot;Hardware highlights&quot;<br/>It&#039;s good to name things. Makes finding things easier.<br/>Another reason for naming those datatables: With &quot;named&quot; datatables, you can easily apply customized styling via CSS, see <a href="https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:data#customizing_the_styling">https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:data#cu … he_styling</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Uh oh. I just realized that I have not been paying enough attention to be able to explain (to someone else) how this is all going to work.</p><p>1) What is the source of the original &#039;dataentry&#039; (to use tmo26&#039;s terminology) for a particular device? Is it on the Device Page? Is it in the separate HTML page that zo0ok is maintaining?</p><p>2) Related question: If ManufacturerX releases their new WRT12345 router, who will create the dataentry? Will it be one of our team? Or will the person who ports OpenWrt to the WRT12345 router then be responsible for creating the Device Page, and thus the dataentry?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>richbhanover</strong> on 11 May 2015, 05:09)</p>
