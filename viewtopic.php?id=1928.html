					<p>I have a config setup that works fine between 3 PCs: 1 vpn server and 2 vpn clients.<br />Then I tried to connect a wrt54g as a vpn client but I have problems:<br />I have done &quot;insmod tun&quot; and run &quot;openvpn config.file&quot; and in the log I can see that the certificates are valid, but the tun0 interface doesn&#039;t appear.<br />I do &quot;top&quot; to see the %CPU ussage and openvpn gets a 99% in the initial proccess of authentication and negotiation without any data traffic !!!!&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />I think this is a bug in the mips cross-compiled openvpn binary because the same configuration with PC works, and openvpn with static-keys between two WRT54G works also.</p><p>Any body running openvpn in WRT54G with Certificates instead of static-keys?<br />Any help?<br />Any idea?</p>									</div>

					<p>How high is your router loaded ? In fact openvpn is not requiring too much CPU time if you don&#039;t transfer files on the tunnel. I don&#039;t think the tun interface should disapear on high loaded router, and I think there must be a missconfiguration causing this issue.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, the info in /proc/loadavg starts at 0.03 and then raise upto 1.00 in less than 2 minutes<br />With &quot;top&quot; the CPU usage for openvpn is 99%.</p><p>I don&#039;t think about a wrong configuration because I have the same setup with i386 PCs and it runs fine.<br />I really don&#039;t know what could be the thing that cause this behavior.</p><p>Any idea?</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, &quot;works here&quot;, so I wouldn&#039;t name it a bug in the cross-compiled binary.<br />Do you start openvpn in init scripts, or do you do it manually?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, thanks for your answer.<br />Actually I have moved the VPN to a PPTP-Server so I can connecto Windows Clients easilly. But I&#039;m still interested in OpenVPN.</p><p>Shining, when I run the OpenVPN client in the WRT54G, I did it manually. Can you show me your config setup and openvpn version or links to the ipkgs?</p><p>Thanks a lot.</p>									</div>
