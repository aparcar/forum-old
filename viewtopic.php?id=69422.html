					<p>hello,</p><p>I have a router (ASUS TM-AC1900) which provides enough wifi coverage on the 1st floor but the signal isnt strong enough in my basement. I have another router (Linksys WRTU54G-TM) that I flashed with OpenWRT (NeutronScotts - wrtu54g-tm-jdownj-openvpn.bin) with the intention of using it in the basement.</p><p>I would like to use the ASUS as the primary router and the Linksys as the secondary, question is how do I connect the two routers in a wireless mode (as opposed to connecting the two with an ethernet cable)</p><p>Appreciate any pointers</p>									</div>

					<p>thank you, I started off this project with the idea of flashing DD WRT firmware (given the advantage it offers for connecting routers) but switched to open wrt after realizing DD WRT is not compatible <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" />.</p><p>I will try this bridging option you suggested.</p>									</div>
