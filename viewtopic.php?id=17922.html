					<p>Hi, everybody.</p><p>I&#039;ve got an RDC8610 Evaluation Board. This is in fact a development kit based on a RDC8610 chip. So it is very similar to the openwrt supported devices (Amit, ar525w etc).<br />I managed to build a ramdisk image of kamikaze (trunk @ r13499) with several packages included and to flash the device. It boots, i can execute commands over serial.</p><p>The problem is that ethernet networking doesn&#039;t work at all.<br />Alfer a reboot ifconfig says that &#039;br-lan&#039; and &#039;eth0&#039; interfaces are up and running with correct network config (ip,mask). But arping/ping to the host machine shows 100% packet loss. Wireshark on the host machine doesn&#039;t see any ARP packages from the device (while it sees ARPs from other network devices). It is also not possible to ping the device back. Physical connectivity is ok, since i can ping redboot during startup.</p><p>The device also has another interface eth1. It is down by default, but it is possible to &#039;ifconfig eth1 up&#039; it with given network configuration. The same: arping/ping doesn&#039;t work, no ARP packets are captured on the host machine.</p><p>Any ideas?</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>									</div>

					<p>Some things to try:</p><p>Just doing &quot;ifconfig eth1 up&quot; is not enough--you want to add it to the LAN bridge along with eth0.<br />You can do this with:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>uci set network.lan.ifname=&quot;eth0 eth1&quot;
/etc/init.d/network restart
(if it does not break anything:)
uci commit network</code></pre></div><p>Also, if it is really similar to the AR525W, it may have a ip175c switch chip onboard which needs some patches to be able to change its configuration, but depending on its defaults, you may need to add a vlan interface like eth0.1 or eth1.1</p>									</div>

					<p>In fact i don&#039;t want to bridge an interface that doesn&#039;t work with a bridge that doesn&#039;t work neither :-)</p><p>All i want is one of the two interfaces up. And with one of the previous kamikaze revisions i was able make eth0 work with the following sequence of commands:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ifconfig br-lan down
ifconfig eth0 down
brctl delbr be-lan
ifconfig eth0 hw ether XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

					<p>This might be a side effect of changes I made to the Ethernet driver. Are you still having the issue?</p>									</div>
