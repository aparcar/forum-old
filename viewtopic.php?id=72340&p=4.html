					<p>I would first backup the configuration. In case of need I would also prepare an original ipk wpad-mini package.<br />Of course this has to happen over wired connection as the wpad binary takes a care of wireless authentication.<br />In the worst case the entry points between linked binaries of wpad, libc, libnl-tiny and others will not be found and the wpad process will crash, so you will have no wireless. In windows there are similar issues when having compatibility problems between some dll library versions. Over wired connection you can perhaps repair the package. In worst case you revert to your basic configuration by reseting your router.</p><p>I&#039;d better flash a sysupgrade to Owrt Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 and then apply the github binaries to update Krack issue.</p><p>Note that the wpad binary is not kernel version dependent, but it has its own dependencies: libc, libnl-tiny, hostapd-common, libubus.

					<p>Can someone answer this please:&nbsp; Do the current snapshots contain the KRACK patches?</p><p>downloads.openwrt.org&nbsp; snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/generic/</p><p>What I infer from the developers post (embedded below) is that the snapshots are updated - build date 3 November</p><p>But I just want this confirmed before I go to the hassle of re-flashing?</p><p>This also means that all people have to do is download the latest snapshot image - flash it - and you&#039;re done.. all updated. There&#039;s very very little difference between the snapshot and 15.05.1, so no one should be worrying about the snapshot being &quot;bleeding edge&quot; and risky, simply because there&#039;s been so little development done since 05.1</p><p>Look forward to an informed response</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>wigyori wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>We&#039;ve decided that for CC we&#039;ll do a bugfix release (CC.1a or CC.2), which will only include the upgraded dropbear, *ssl, dnsmasq, and hostapd binaries.
