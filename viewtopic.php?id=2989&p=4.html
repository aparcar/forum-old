I don&#039;t want everyone trying to draw the exact same logo. As such, I can&#039;t provide any samples of what I think are good logos.</p><p>Anyways, some points that I want to make -</p><p>- As andy pointed out, this is a logo and we&#039;d like to be able to use it in print (papers/manuals and tshirts) so the colors need to be kept to a minimum. To simplify things, I&#039;m going to say right now &quot;logos need to be 4 colors or less, not including the background color&quot;.</p><p>- Do not submit logos showing pixelization. Learn how to use vector art or anti aliasing. Should your logo win, you are expected to be able to produce either vector art (eg: postscript) or a high resoultion image (high enough resolution that it can be printed on the front/back of a tshirt without being pixelized).</p><p>- I know this is linux and it&#039;s wireless, but the radio waves and tux clipart are over used. If you&#039;re going to use some sort of radio waves do it in a style other than the &quot;)))&quot; cliche. Also - and I can&#039;t stress this enough - no pictures or represenations of the Linksys WRT54G in the logo. </p><p>- The logo should fall into one of two categories: either completely meaningless or a represenation of what you think openwrt is/means/does. A meaningless logo would be stylized leters and/or an abstract logo. A meaningful logo would be some representation of &quot;open&quot; &quot;wireless&quot; &quot;freedom&quot; or &quot;multi functional&quot; (whatever words you think apply to openwrt) in the form of a logo. The only text allowed on the logo is &quot;OpenWrt&quot; and &quot;Wireless Freedom&quot; (I really don&#039;t care if you upercase them).</p><p>- Keep the logo simple; you do not need to fill the entire area.</p><p>...</p><br /><p>Who know, there may be a prize <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><br /><p>The entries that I&#039;ve liked (in no particular order) -</p><p>josephus, framer99, johnk, andy</p><p>alej00d &amp; RockyGryphon: The box on the O just isn&#039;t working; although I do like the way you&#039;ve tried to match the existing ascii banner.</p>									</div>
