					<p>Hi,</p><p>Since one week I got those warnings each time I run the make menuconfig.

					<p>Yeah, freeswitch has dependencies to non-existing packages. Those dependencies are related to freeswitch modules marked BROKEN, but the recent metadata handling changes have brought those warnings into highlight.</p><p>I suggested fixes in a pull request, but so far the package maintainer has not implemented them:<br /><a href="https://github.com/openwrt/telephony/pull/250">https://github.com/openwrt/telephony/pull/250</a></p><p>(Instead, he today updated the package but left the wrong dependencies in place)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 23 Jan 2018, 18:39)</p>

					<p>This is a good workaround if you do not need the package causing the problems: ./scripts/feeds uninstall freeswitch.</p><p>When problem i as fixed by developer. Just run ./scripts/feeds update -a&nbsp; &nbsp;then&nbsp; run ./scripts/feeds install -a&nbsp; or ./scripts/feeds install freeswitch to just install to problem package in question.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>swedaserve</strong> on 29 Jan 2018, 18:40)</p>
