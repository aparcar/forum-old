					<p>I was wondering if someone here can point me in the right direction of troubleshooting a power issue that recently cropped up with my Asus RT-N13U B1. It could be powered on for 12hrs to 48hrs, and suddenly for no reason all the lights shut off on the router while it&#039;s plugged into the AC outlet. The power adapter works fine with my old Asus WL-520gu with no issues, so I don&#039;t think it&#039;s that. It&#039;s very intermittent. I have a self powered usb hub plugged into it with an external HDD.</p><p>After sitting for a half day, I&#039;ll supple power to the router again, and it powers up! 12-24hrs later it powers off again with the power adapter plugged in. It is plugged right into a surge protector that stays on 24/7. No other electronics plugged into the surge protector has issues.</p><p>Any ideas would be appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>Are you using the original power adapter?<br />Check output of adapter against input requirments of router.</p><p>Open the device, and check for swollen elco&#039;s, an example of such defect elco:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www.pc-helpforum.be/attachments/f186/15387d1324291677-strepen-hokjes-op-beeldscherm-vanaf-opstarten-elco-charger-sony-hamil.jpg" alt="elco" /></span></p><p>The top should be nicely flat, not round like above.<br />If you find such elco, replace it asap <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Otherwise the power stabilisator on the router could be defect, more difficult to replace.</p><p>Regards, DG.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>DGDodo</strong> on 15 May 2014, 02:23)</p>
