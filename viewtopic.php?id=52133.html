					<p>Hi list! </p><p>As many RPI users knows, the tiny computer is not very happy with voltage variations, sudden shutdowns etc, leading to SD card filesystem corruption [1].</p><p>So, I was hoping for a fairly static (under a disk perspective) OpenWRT image for RPI. SquashFS + some overlay or something like that, in order to keep the SD card as quiet as possible, so it would make the RPI way more resilient.</p><p>However, I paid a visit to <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07-rc1/brcm2708/generic/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_br â€¦ 8/generic/</a> and I&#039;ve found ext4 and&nbsp; vfat + ext4 (yuck!) OpenWRT images for RPI.</p><p>This fairly static image would be a damn good idea for unstable environments, and also enhancing RPI&#039;s resilience.</p><p>Anyone dealt with it?</p><p>And a question, what is the 4-MB&nbsp; <strong>penwrt-brcm2708-Image</strong> file at the repo?</p><p>Thanks a lot,</p><p>- RF.</p><p>[1] - <a href="http://bit.ly/1sR0OoL">http://bit.ly/1sR0OoL</a></p><p>---<br />EDIT:<br />Some other users are also interested on it.

					<p>You can always create a ram drive for stuff like /var/run and mount the / read-only. That works with Raspbian too.<br />I think I saw few forum posts out there explaining how to use a ram drive for that on the Pi.</p><p>Just my 2 cents.</p>									</div>

					<h5>Building a JFFS2 OpenWRT Raspberry Pi image with hard float support.</h5><br /><br /><h5>Issue</h5><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The default Raspberry Pi OpenWRT image uses the ext4 filesystem.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Raspberry Pi is known to corrupt the ext4 filesystem if rebooted abruplty or voltage conditions are not optimal.</p><br /><h5>Environment</h5><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Raspberry Pi<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; OpenWRT Barrier Breaker (14.07)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 for cross-compiling the artifacts.</p><br /><h5>Resolution</h5><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Build a JFFS2 OpenWRT image. While JFFS2 is not suited for block devices, its filesystem design won&#039;t corrupt the entire filesystem in case of some data miswrite, but just the corrupted file (bad, bad ext4). It also supports native data compression.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Step by step instructions:</p><p> <strong>Kernel build:</strong><br /></p><ol class="decimal"><li><p>Check out the openwrt image: <span class="bbu">git clone git://git.openwrt.org/openwrt.git --depth 1</span></p></li><li><p>cd to the openwrt directory</p></li><li><p>If you need/want extra packages (such as Luci, etc.), run the following commands: <span class="bbu">./scripts/feeds update -a ; ./scripts/feeds install -a</span></p></li><li><p>Run: <span class="bbu">make defconfig ; make prereq ; make menuconfig</span></p></li><li><p>In &quot;<span class="bbu">Target System</span>&quot; select &quot;<span class="bbu">Broadcom BCM2708/BCM2835</span>&quot;</p></li><li><p>Scroll down to &quot;<span class="bbu">Target images</span>&quot;. Check the box JFFS2. <strong>Do not touch ext4</strong>. If you remove it, it will remove the root partition size config option, yielding a failure when generating the JFFS2 image at the end of the build.</p></li><li><p>Uncheck &quot;<span class="bbu">GZip images</span>&quot;</p></li><li><p>Change the &quot;<span class="bbu">Root filesystem partition size (in MB)</span>&quot; for a suitable value or leave it untouched.</p></li><li><p>Return to main menu. Scroll down and check &quot;<span class="bbu">Advanced configuration options (for developers)</span>&quot;</p></li><li><p>Check the box &quot;<span class="bbu">Target Options</span>&quot;. Enter this submenu.</p></li><li><p>Change &quot;<span class="bbu">Target Optimizations</span>&quot; to the following string: <span class="bbu">-O2 -pipe -march=armv6j -mfpu=vfp -mfloat-abi=hard</span></p></li><li><p>Deselect the option &quot;<span class="bbu">Use software floating point by default</span>&quot;</p></li><li><p>Go back to the main menu. Enter &quot;<span class="bbu">Kernel Modules</span>&quot;.&nbsp; Enter the &quot;<span class="bbu">Block Devices</span>&quot; submenu.</p></li><li><p>Set &quot;<span class="bbu">kmod-block2mtd</span>&quot; to &quot;builtin&quot; type. Press spacebar untill an asterisk shows at the box.</p></li><li><p>Return back to the root menu and select the packages that you want to install</p></li><li><p>And then, build your kernel: make</p></li></ol><p><strong>Setting up the SD card:</strong><br /></p><ol class="alpha"><li><p>Become root</p></li><li><p>Insert your SD card</p></li><li><p>Umount the partitions that might be mounted automatically</p></li><li><p>cd to build directory and cd to bin/brcm2708</p></li><li><p>Write the image: <span class="bbu">dd if=openwrt-brcm2708-sdcard-vfat-jffs2-64k.img of=&lt;device&gt;</span>&nbsp; &lt;device&gt; is where your SD card is attached. i.e., /dev/mmcblk0, /dev/sdb, etc</p></li><li><p>After the write, ensure to commit the data to the SD card, by running: <span class="bbu">sync</span></p></li><li><p>Eject and reinsert the SD card</p></li><li><p>At the vfat partition, edit the file cmdline.txt and replace its content with the following content:<br /><span class="bbu">block2mtd.block2mtd=/dev/mmcblk0p2,65536,rootfs,5 root=/dev/mtdblock0 rootfstype=jffs2 rootwait console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 noinitrd</span></p></li></ol><p>And you&#039;re done!</p><br /><h5>Notes</h5><ul><li><p>Avoid defining a very large partition at the menuconfig step. The <span class="bbu">block2mtd</span> will scan the <strong>whole</strong> partition at boot time, so define a size enough for your business.</p></li><li><p>JFFS2 is <em>not</em> a super-fast filesystem.</p></li><li><p>Double-check where is your SD card inserted when writing the image using the <span class="bbu">dd</span> tool (Step H).</p></li><li><p>The Raspberry Pi will start as a DHCP server, with IP address <span class="bbu">192.168.1.1</span>. If you have defined LuCi at the make menuconfig, just point the browser to this address. Notice that LuCi is not installed by default and needs to be explicitly enabled in both steps 3 and 13. </p></li><li><p>If you didn&#039;t install LuCi, you can&#039;t ssh until you define a root password. Telnet to 192.168.1.1 and define a root password.</p></li><li><p>I strongly recommend the Apple USB ethernet adapter for the 2nd NIC. Rock stable, powered by RPI&#039;s own USB port. See <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_USB_Ethernet_adapters">eLinux</a>.</p></li><li><p>It is not booting? Double-check steps 13 and 14.</p></li><li><p>If you want to write the 128k image, don&#039;t forget to change the erase block size at the step H (it&#039;s the 2nd value on <span class="bbu">block2mtd</span> cmdline).</p></li></ul>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>man</strong> on 27 Aug 2014, 03:47)</p>

					<p>No problem.</p><p>Just wanting to share something here. I used some brand name SD cards with my Seagate Dockstar. The way I did this was to format my SD cards with EXT3 and then filled it by untarring a newly built OpenWRT tarred image. My SD cards usually go bad after 30+ x of reflash with a newly built OpenWRT image. Now, I resort to an old 120GB IDE drive. So far, so good.</p>									</div>
