However, this <a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Hot-Sale-USB-CAT5-CAT5E-6-RJ45-Ethernet-Extender-Lan-Extension-Cable-Repeater-Adapter-with-Retail/756721416.html">USB CAT5/CAT5E/6 RJ45 Ethernet Extender</a> claims it is a self-powered. If so, perhaps this may help unless its self-powered rating is below the power needed by your USB/WiFi dongle.</p><p>For the price of a <a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Hot-Sale-USB-CAT5-CAT5E-6-RJ45-Ethernet-Extender-Lan-Extension-Cable-Repeater-Adapter-with-Retail/756721416.html">USB CAT5/CAT5E/6 RJ45 Ethernet Extender</a>, perhaps you may wanna contemplate to get a Seagate <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Seagate-FreeAgent-DockStar-Network-Adapter-Brand-NEW-NAS-Network-Storage-/330974711760?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item4d0fa14fd0">DockStar</a> / <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Seagate-FreeAgent-GoFlex-Home-Gigabit-Ethernet-NAS-Dock-Power-Adapter-only-/321166572152?pt=US_Drive_Enclosures_Docks&amp;hash=item4ac704fa78">GoFLEX Home</a> / <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Seagate-FreeAgent-GoFlex-Net-Media-Sharing-Transfer-Dual-Hard-Drive-Dock-STAK100-/181062812763?pt=US_Drive_Enclosures_Docks&amp;hash=item2a282f445b">GoFLEX NET</a> device from e-bay or even any <a href="http://www.jr.com/brand/pogoplug">PogoPlug</a> device to bridge between one of the RJ45 ports on your router and a USB/WiFi dongle. Not only will you be able to achieve your goal, but you can also use the DockStar to host your PBX system, files, printer, etc., for the price of the device. If you take this route, then you will probably need to reconfigure your device as a bridge. I had tried to convert my Seagate DockStar into a router as shown <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=42635">here</a> and it didn&#039;t work. However, if you read this <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=207158#p207158">post</a>, you will notice I finally managed to get it working after some helps from Paul Fertser.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: ONLY some PogoPLug devices are supported by OpenWRT.</p>									</div>
