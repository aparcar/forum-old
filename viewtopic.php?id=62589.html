					<p>I wanted to flash OpenWrt on this device, but I then realized that there is not much documentation on the Wikis about it.<br />I searched and found that this device (Edimax BR-6478AC - <a href="https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Edimax_BR-6478AC">https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Edimax_BR-6478AC</a>) has the same hardware, or at least a very similar.<br />Since the Edimax device is supported on OpenWrt and has very similar hardware, it is possible to flash it on the Netis without bricking it?<br />Here is a full resolution image (<a href="http://www.filedropper.com/20160206135250">http://www.filedropper.com/20160206135250</a>) of the mainboard of the Netis. I also have a RS232 to USB adapter to access the logs from the device, if is needed. The only thing I need to know is where do I solder the RX, TX and GND in order to access this thing.<br />I have some basic knoweledge about linux, but it would be very helpful if anyone could help me to flash a OpenWrt Image on it.<br />The router is used as a second router, so if I temporarily soft-brick it, it has not much problem.</p><p>Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Fusseldieb</strong> on 6 Feb 2016, 19:20)</p>

Means that I am capable of &quot;building&quot; a working OpenWrt image for it? Or at least for debugging purposes?<br />I already have dualboot with Windows and Ubuntu here, so building a image should not be a problem... I just need some assistance.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Fusseldieb</strong> on 9 Feb 2016, 20:30)</p>
