Different projects treat the code repository in different ways. It looks like openwrt treats the trunk as the most up to date code (bleeding edge), then for numbered releases they create a branch, stabilize that branch and then release. Once the branch is released it is frozen except to backport fixes from trunk.</p><p>I may not be 100% correct on their code practices, but that&#039;s what I have observed since I started poking around a few weeks.</p><p>If you&#039;re curious about sourcecode management, check out this link at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16142/what-do-branch-tag-and-trunk-really-mean/">Stack Overflow.</a>. Both of the top two answers are correct, it just depending on how the developers decide to manage the code.</p>									</div>

By &quot;end to end&quot;, I mostly meant the end-to-end continuity of the wires as they leave the serial side of the Nokia converter to the header on the board. I recall seeing a problem very similar to yours when my GND connection had come loose mid-wire.</p><p>You can also have a problem if the TXD wire is loosely connected. If the loose wire accidentally &quot;transmits&quot; anything early on during the WNDR3700 boot sequence, U-boot will abort the usual boot and drop you into a prompt.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>edvarim wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>From my understanding the install is not hosed, its just the firewall i managed to fuck up.

(I didn&#039;t read through the fine print to see how well it works in the case that the firewall is hosed, but I imagine that it might.) Of course, you need to have it previously installed before things go south!</p>									</div>
