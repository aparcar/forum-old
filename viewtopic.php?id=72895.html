I get a strong 80% of my rated download speeds all through my 2 story house on the 2.4ghz band. With the latest stock firmware. 2.5ghz channel is 30 db from behind my 65&quot; tv as i sit 2 m away facing it. There is no other router that strong without modding power tables. That and it running cool and ultra stable, is why I chose such a router. Unfortunately the firmware is a bit cumbersome but managable. May hold off on any open wrt or Untangled builds until another year or so, when things level off and are fixed.</p><p>IMO modding power tables is the wrong way to go about it. If needing to expand range a simple extender will do the trick and not mess with neighbors.&nbsp; If everyone boosted their outputs you would not see improvements to do so.</p><p>Always try to keep signals mounted high as possible, more range without needing boost. That&#039;s why I mounted my router upstairs in our Tv room, which is a converted bedroom. Also it is over the largest used area of the house for coverage. The only limitations are garage and 3rd bathroom, located at the far corner of the house.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Notsofast</strong> on 1 Jan 2018, 17:47)</p>

					<p>Smaller flat, in my case.<br />I have older devices, all are G. Cannot say if I might get that linksys.<br />Atheros would be fine, I assume it is broadcom. Or not.<br />I&#039;m open for further advices. The point would be if I could manage to<br />get them here locally.<br />Best regards.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you have neighbors, buying a dual band unit is good for the future as you&#039;re going to eventually want to move out of the crowded 2.4 band.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t have interference issues then a single band router like the 1043 is fine.&nbsp; Definitely avoid anything with Broadcom chips.&nbsp; Depending on your ISP speed you may not need gigabit Ethernet.</p>									</div>
