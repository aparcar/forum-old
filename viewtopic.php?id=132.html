					<p>After about 20 false starts, I managed to get openwrt compiled using FreeBSD as a build system.&nbsp; I&#039;m sharing in case there are others who are interested.</p><p>The changes come in two parts: a set of new files and a patch.&nbsp; They&#039;re all in the tarball at <a href="http://electricrain.com/fenner/openwrt/freebsd-openwrt-20040509.tar.bz2">http://electricrain.com/fenner/openwrt/ … 09.tar.bz2</a>.<br />The README is at <a href="http://electricrain.com/fenner/openwrt/freebsd-openwrt-20040509.README.txt">http://electricrain.com/fenner/openwrt/ … README.txt</a>.</p><p>There was only one piece of code that I had to patch, in squashfs to determine endianness.&nbsp; Otherwise, the only problems were in the differences between GNU tools and BSD - e.g., &quot;install -D&quot;, &quot;xargs -i&quot;, &quot;find&quot; with no pathname, &quot;cp -a&quot;.&nbsp; There&#039;s more detail in the README.&nbsp; My general tactic was to create shell scripts as compatability shims; these scripts are mostly horrible hacks that work only in the current openwrt environment.</p><p>I&#039;d like to see the openwrt build system move towards being more portable, so that eventually the openwrt distribution can build on FreeBSD without patches.&nbsp; There are some thoughts in the README about how to make it there.&nbsp; For now, though, at least those of us with BSD but not Linux are able to build a system!</p><p>Enjoy!</p><p>&nbsp; Bill</p><p>Quick howto:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>wget http://openwrt.ksilebo.net/temp/b4-pre/buildroot-20040509.tar.bz2

					<p>Bill,</p><p>I ran into a problem following your instructions:</p><p>[code]./build_mipsel/WRT54GS/release/src/linux/linux/scripts/Configure[/code]</p><p>was complaining that it needed to run under bash.&nbsp; It was invoked as [code]sh scripts/Configure[/code] by the Makefile above it.</p><p>It looks like setting BASH in the environment to /usr/local/bin/bash (which must be installed from ports) made it all better.&nbsp; I expect you didn&#039;t catch this because you probably use bash as your shell, so that variable was already set.&nbsp; ;-)</p><p>--plambert<br />[/code]</p>									</div>

					<p>Notes for current builders: Among other things, you&#039;ll need gnu find, which is in the ports tree as misc/findutils</p><p>There other things you&#039;ll need to build from ports in order to compile OpenWRT (as of r10539) but I can&#039;t remember them all at this time. But they were easy to find it ports when I made the effort, unlike findutils, (which I assumed would have been named gfind or gnufind).</p><br /><p>I had more problems, so I went back to trying generic 7.09 as it came out of the tar file, no updates.</p><p>There&#039;s also problems, with BSD sed not liking the -E option...have to figure out how to get gnu sed to be used instead of bsd sed.</p><p>I think that the BSD build of OpenWRT should be marked as &#039;broken&#039; and FreeBSD builds marked as &#039;unsupported&#039; until these problems are fixed, and that part of deeming a version a &#039;release&#039; is a successful FreeBSD build. Of course, I just realized that I don&#039;t recall BSD as being listed as a platform for building OpenWRT (In spite of my dire need) so there might not be any changes needed in the dox for this problem.</p>									</div>
