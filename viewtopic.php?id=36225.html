					<p>Hello, sorry if this has been answered but I&#039;ve been unable to find specific details, like MIB information, etc regarding this.</p><p>Question:</p><p>I am looking for a cheaper solution than using a ruggedcom router/switch, it has to be either cheap enough to be disposable or bullet proof like ruggedcom (200$ max to be disposable) to monitor client mac addresses via SNMP I know you can run SNMPD on OpenWRT from the documentation I&#039;ve read so far but before buying a device I want to make sure it can do this. </p><br /><p>So:</p><p>Need to know if SNMPD on OpenWRT can send client mac address info via SNMP and where I can find the MIB information to do so if it is possible.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zeruulln</strong> on 16 Apr 2012, 00:47)</p>
