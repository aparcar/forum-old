					<p>I presently have a WRT54G running white russian and I don&#039;t have enough flash memory to run wireless snort and openvpen and the CIFS client. Snort was one of a long list of apps documented on this web site but don&#039;t see that list anymore. Is wireless snort still supported?</p><p> There used to be some pages on this site called &quot;success stories&quot;. Are they gone?</p><p>Anyway, I want to buy another router so I can run openvpen, the CIFS client and wireless snort. I could add a SD card (as per the directions on the old site) or just buy one with enough memory in the first place, I suppose.</p><p>What would be some favorite models, manufactures and retailers?</p><p>After looking at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware">http://wiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware</a> I see there are a lot of new features like USB ports hmmmmm.... Can I add flash memory with the USB ports?<br />I was just looking at freecom -- I wonder if those Europeon products would run in North America (where I am).</p><p>Hmmmm... WRTSL54GS looks like the only one that supports openWRT and USB. Is it readily available?</p><p>What might be some other favorite features besides USB ports I might be interested in?</p><p>A while a go there was a lot of concern about linksys abandoning linux in favor of vxworks making openwrt compatible hardware scarce. Is this still an issue? <br />Thanks,<br />Siegfried</p>									</div>
