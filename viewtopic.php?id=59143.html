					<p>I have flashed the most recent BB 14.07 and having a difficult time trying to get the wireless to work. In the GUI under Wifi I have two options: 802.11n (radio0) and 802.11bgn (radio1).&nbsp; I have radio1 configured, however it is extremely slow. I am a mere 5 feet from the router and am only getting 39 Mbps. I&#039;ve tried changing the channel with not much difference. </p><p>I had also configured radio0 but after messing around with the channel and other settings to try to get it working it wont come back up. Also was extremely slow. I only need N on this radio as I do not have an AC devices at this time.&nbsp; What are the settings I need to work with to get it connected better than Fair and how do I bring up the adapter?</p><p>Update:</p><br /><p>root@OpenWrt:~# cat /etc/config/wireless<br />config wifi-device &#039;radio0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option type &#039;mac80211&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option channel &#039;149&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option hwmode &#039;11a&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option path &#039;pci0000:01/0000:01:00.0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option htmode &#039;VHT80&#039;</p><p>config wifi-iface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;radio0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option mode &#039;ap&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ssid &#039;home 5g&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option encryption &#039;psk2+ccmp&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option key &#039;hidden&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option network &#039;lan&#039;</p><p>config wifi-device &#039;radio1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option type &#039;mac80211&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option channel &#039;11&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option hwmode &#039;11g&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option path &#039;platform/qca955x_wmac&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option txpower &#039;23&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option country &#039;US&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option htmode &#039;HT40&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option noscan &#039;1&#039;</p><p>config wifi-iface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;radio1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option mode &#039;ap&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ssid &#039;home 2.4G&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option encryption &#039;psk2+ccmp&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option key &#039;hidden&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option network &#039;lan&#039;</p><br /><p>In GUI each adapter shows: &quot;Wireless is disabled or not associated&quot;&nbsp; when I click on enable nothing is happening.</p><br /><p>Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Maverik1</strong> on 21 Aug 2015, 06:51)</p>

However, as mentioned previously the speed is horrible.&nbsp; I loaded ddwrt a few days ago and was getting 150 Mbps on the 5Ghz channel on my Galaxy Note 2 and 72 Mbps on the 2.4 Ghz channel.&nbsp; The phone supports N speeds. These are also the speeds I was getting on stock firmware.&nbsp; </p><p>Currently on the 2.4 Ghz channel I&#039;m getting about 6 - 40 Mbps and the 5 Ghz channel is around 54 Mbps. I can be standing 5 feet from the access point and not see any changes.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also tried changing channels.&nbsp; The settings are a bit confusing and maybe I am missing something.&nbsp; I&#039;d really love to implement this firmware as it would bring support for Vlan tagging.</p>									</div>
