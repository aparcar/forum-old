					<p>The Archer D7 has a Broadcom 63xx modem, which there are no drivers for in OpenWrt. I wouldn&#039;t hold my breath for it.</p><p>Many <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/soc/soc.lantiq">Lantiq</a> based devices are supported, also see <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/tag/adsl2?do=showtag&amp;tag=ADSL2%2B">ADSL2+ devices</a>. I think you&#039;ll have better luck finding a suitable device starting from lists of DSL devices and working your way through them. I don&#039;t know if any of them have an 11ac radio.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makro</strong> on 13 Jan 2015, 22:53)</p>

					<p>An ac radio combined with a DSL modem doesn&#039;t make a lot of sense in the marketplace.&nbsp; If you only have DSL for internet, the ac radio is no advantage over n or even g unless you are also doing heavy LAN traffic such as serving files or video locally.&nbsp; Most people interested in high performance prefer two boxes.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 14 Jan 2015, 15:50)</p>

BCM63xx has been around for many years and is probably the most common SoC with DSL modem, and while there are some efforts to implement support for it, it&#039;s not exactly around the corner.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>&nbsp; Maybe it&#039;s a bit premature buying an 11ac router considering that I&#039;ve got just one device with ac capabilities.</p><p>I&#039;ve found the asus dsl-n55u for a good price.

					<p>I don&#039;t know. If you would like to contribute, you could send an email on the -devel list and ask if anyone knows this device/chipset, and is interested in working on support for it if you donate a device for development.</p><p>Also, I actually found an 11ac DSL modem - Asus DSL-AC68U. It&#039;s an RT-AC68U with a (A|V)DSL modem in it. I can pretty much guarantee that this device will not be supported by OpenWrt, given its Broadcom chipset and radios. I&#039;ve been looking for a replacement modem myself recently, and OpenWrt support would be nice, but not required in this case. I haven&#039;t found any modem supported by OpenWrt with a 5 GHz radio (be it 11na or 11ac). The TP-Link TD-W8980 is supported, but its 5 GHz radio is not (2.4 GHz is supported). So I think you need to evaluate your requirements - OpenWrt support or wireless features/connectivity.</p>									</div>

					<p>It is not that hard.. pick any Atheros non AC hardware .. you should be golden.. don&#039;t go for Broadcom (closed source) or any weird brand chipsets unless you are willing to chip in to help with dev.</p>									</div>

					<p>On the contrary, it is not that simple. Unless you know of a supported Atheros/Qualcomm SoC with a DSL modem, I can&#039;t find any.</p><p>An additional criteria for the_eraser to evaluate, in addition to OpenWrt support and wireless features, is of course using separate modem and router. That will give you the best of both worlds, aside from an extra device and power supply.</p>									</div>
