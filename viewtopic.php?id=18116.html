					<p>Has anyone tried this?&nbsp; One google search showed it on Nico&#039;s &quot;to do&quot; list.&nbsp; :-)</p><p>After a couple of days of trying to build/debug it seems I need bdb compiled with full posix threads and mutexes in order to get slapd to run.&nbsp; From what I can tell uClibc/libpthread/linuxthreads.old does not support mutexes and I&#039;m having a hard time getting any other form uClibc to compile/run.&nbsp; </p><p>I&#039;m most interested in the mipsel target so I&#039;m wondering if the right solution isn&#039;t to use uClibc-nptl - is anyone looking at integrating nptl into the kamikaze trun?</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br />Kevin</p>									</div>
