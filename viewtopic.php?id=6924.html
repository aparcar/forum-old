					<p>Hi</p><p>When I install Olsrd version 0.4.10-1 with either firmware release RC5 or RC4, the DMZ LED stays permanently ON. However, when I use Olsrd 0.4.9-1 the problem disappears.<br />I tried with my own firmware builds and also the ones download from this site with the same effect. </p><p>What is causing this? </p><p>I need to provide users with a single firmware file, and I currenlty using the RC5 base. Am I correct to assume RC5 is stable?</p><br /><p>I will greatly appreciate your help.</p><br /><br /><p>Regards;</p><p>Socrates</p>									</div>
