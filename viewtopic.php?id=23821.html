					<p>We have a problem about how this normally could be done to integrate a new driver to the openwrt buildsystem.</p><p>A friend of mine made the USB driver for the openrb Routerboard working. First he want to do this with the openwrt system but he had alot of problems. There had to be done some changes to the Kernel and if this will be done openwrt buildsystem ignores at the end the changes and took a default config.</p><p>Then he build the Kernel and drivers with his handmade scripts after 2 days of wasting time . So because the driver is now working <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/cool.png" width="15" height="15" alt="cool" /> &quot;We have USB on the PowerPC Board&quot;&nbsp; we would enjoy if this could be integrated to the buildsystem without drilling wholes into our knees.</p><p>There are a lot of tutorials webside&#039;s and stuff outside which explain how to but non of them worked because they are to old or for other versions or something else.In other words all the descriptions are a little mess</p><p>It would be very kind if somebody could describe how to integrate drivers and kernel kernelconfig etc who is familiar with the openwrt buildsystem. <br />So we can use the saved time to optimize the driver for performance.</p><p>At the moment we have about 30% of the max theoretical performance and hopefully with a look of the timing to the signals we could get much more.</p><p>So if anybody out there which could assist in how to fit the stuff into the openwrt buildsystem this would be great for all PPC users.</p><br /><p>best regards Martin</p>									</div>

For readers here, posting question on this very HOWTO/DOCUMENTAION forum is a no no and can be considered as an ignorance or even as an offense, YMMV! The forum is for readers to find/read some HOWTO and/or DOCUMENTATION and isn&#039;t for asking any questions, AFAIK.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>If you are well or better known an answer like this forum is mor for this please post your question there would help much more, ...</p></blockquote></div><p>Please the FAQ!</p>									</div>
