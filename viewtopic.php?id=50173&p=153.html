					<p>I flashed the March 24th trunk build as soon as it was available, was running VERY well for about 16hrs. Then it spontaneously rebooted a couple of times. Last night about 8pm, it rebooted and then got stuck rebooting, had to take it offline as it was stuck in a reboot cycle. Just wanted to send out a heads up.</p>									</div>

					<p>Built an image from trunk 2 days ago and have not had the chronic issues I&#039;ve seen previously. Apple devices are working fine. In addition, under McWRT I had issues with large transfers through the device-- both wired and wifi-- consistently staled out around the 3-4MB mark-- and that was tested from non-Apple devices just to verify. I&#039;ve never had issues with reboots but did have issues with CPU stalls-- but have not seen that yet either. Note currently only testing 5Ghz.</p><p>Note too, my image is pretty hefty-- running bind, postfix, lighttpd, netatalk, avahi, qos (all in the image, not packages and plus the &quot;normal&quot; stuff such as dropbear, dnsmasq, luci, ntp, etc) with an attached 4TB USB drive acting as a TimeMachine.</p><p>Correction-- forgot to mention but I do have one issue that I haven&#039;t been able to track down.. ssh&#039;ing in over wifi and 3 seconds (always about 3 seconds) and I get latency... it&#039;s pretty consistent but then will often go away after some people of time. I&#039;ve also seen some latency is browsing but it&#039;s not consistent and haven&#039;t been able to determine if it&#039;s possibly the same issue.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jklap</strong> on 26 Mar 2015, 16:37)</p>

					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I have followed this thread since the beginning and things now look stable/developed enough that I thought it time to have a go building some images and playing around with my 1900AC and OpenWRT.&nbsp; Nice work everyone getting it to this point.</p><p>First thing I did was install trunk over stock firmware.&nbsp; All worked fine.&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; OpenWRT is go.</p><p>Next I built a minimal image myself and installed that via Luci interface.&nbsp; Installed fine but there was no WAN access.&nbsp; The WRT1900AC would obtain an IP address via DHCP (so network connectivity out WAN was successful) but there was no way to access external or local IP addresses from the router itself or from a computer connected to LAN ports.&nbsp; Fail.&nbsp; Hmmm.</p><p>Back to the trunk buildbot image and WAN working fine again.</p><p>Built a new image using the config file from <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/mvebu/generic/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots … u/generic/</a> figuring I would get the same working image and go from there, but no.&nbsp; The image built fine but once installed there was no WAN access again (other than successful DHCP lease obtained).&nbsp; *sigh*</p><p>This is all with default setup - no firewall rules or anything introduced.</p><p>I&#039;m hoping that someone out there has already run into and overcome this problem.&nbsp; Any assistance greatly appreciated.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>CV</p>									</div>
