					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have installed the latest RoundSparrow build on my TEW-632BRP. It seems to work great. It is better than the original trendnet and D-Link 631 revC firmwares. The router doesn&#039;t restart and the wireless works good in g mode (2.1-2.3 mb/s) and it rarely interrupts. The only feature I would like to install further is qos. I have tried to install it, but some of the dependencies were not available. Also, the space on the device runs low and even if i uninstall some of the unneeded packages (ppp related, or luci), i gain no space. Is there a way to install qos-scripts on this firmware build? Can I compile the .uni firmware image to contain all the packages I need? (meaning what is now in the latest build + qos?). I have tried this on latest ubuntu, but it gave me a compilation nerror. I will try it on fedora 10, too. But I guess it would be easier to install the qos-scripts on the RoundSparrow&#039;s build. I just need some directions.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Mine is 1.0. I have successfully installed on it (using the failsafe boot - meaning rebooting the router with the button pressed, and then accessing <a href="http://192.168.10.1">http://192.168.10.1</a> the firmware upgrade page where surprisingly it writes D-Link DIR-615) the image </p><p><a href="http://sites.google.com/a/roundsparrow.com/openwrt_ap81/Home/openwrt_r14959_ar71xx-tew-632brp.uni?attredirects=0">openwrt_r14959_ar71xx-tew-632brp.uni</a> </p><p>You have to make the following steps:</p><p>1) set your ip manually for 192.168.10.2<br />2) reboot the router in the safe mode (pressing the button from behind the router with a needle)<br />3) access <a href="http://192.168.10.1">http://192.168.10.1</a><br />4) upload the image openwrt_r14959_ar71xx-tew-632brp.uni (you may need to use internet explorer for that, and you also may need to change with a hex editor the last digit from 0 to 2 or viceversa) ant try that many times until it works<br />5) the router then automatically reboots<br />6) set your ip for DHCP (automatically get the IP)<br />7) access <a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a> - you will find the luci web app<br />8) login with root and no password - and then change the password from the menu</p><p>8&#039;)alternatively you can login via telnet with start...run...cmd (from windows) with the command<br />telnet 19.168.1.1<br />and then you can setup your root password with the command<br />passwd</p><p>9) you can access further the router via command line onlyt by ssh (with putty on port 22) and not with telnet (deactivated by the command passwd) or by web interface using the root account and the password specified</p><p>It worked very good on my router. The only thing I am worried about is that i can no longer reinstall the original trendnet firmware<br />Now the router does not connect wirelessly in n mode, only in g<br />I have all i need on it, except thq qos-scripts which i couldn&#039;t install because the dependencies are not compiled and because there is not much space left on the device for that. It seems that the dependencies must be compiled in the kernel, not as modules, and the image must be compiled with the packages preinstalled. But I don&#039;t know how to do that and I don&#039;t really have time to document, so I wait for a new firmware image fromRoundSparrow.</p><p>Also, there are some good firmware images from x-wrt.org, but they use the madwifi driver fo rwireless (RoundSparrow uses ath9k and mac80211) which doesn&#039;t work on my router, or I dont&#039;t know how to set it up. The web interface from x-wrt says that there were no wifi card detected. So I stick with RoundSparrow for the moment.</p><p>Regards</p><p>P.S.: check also<br /><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=19591">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=19591</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have successfully compiled my first firmware image in the uni format. I used my laptop, a Dell Inspiron with Fedora 10, 4 gb ram and core2duo 1.83 ghz.</p><p>Here&#039;s what I did:<br />1) as root I did<br />yum install build-essential binutils flex bison autoconf gettext texinfo sharutils subversion ncurses-devel ncurses-term zlib1g-dev<br />note that some packages names differ in fedora vs ubuntu<br />2) as reguar user I did:<br />mkdir /what/.../ever/svn<br />cd /what/.../ever/svn<br />svn co svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk/<br />cd trunk/<br />3) ./scripts/feeds update -a<br />4) ./scripts/feeds install -a<br />5) i wanted to install luci administration, so i did:<br />./scripts/feeds update packages luci<br />./scripts/feeds install -a -p luci<br />(5) this step actually i didn&#039;t do, bt i guess that if tou want to compile some packages, you can:<br />cd ..<br />svn co svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/packages/<br />i don&#039;t know what is with updating to the latest sources<br />svn up<br />and with<br />make packages/symlinks<br />I would like to compile it with webif, but i didn&#039;t succeed<br />6) i ran<br />cd trunk/<br />make menuconfig<br />chose atheros ar71xx, ad choose to compile most of the wanted packages prebuilt in, not as modules<br />7) done make, but it gave me an error teling me that i hae to do make V=99, so i did:<br />make v=99 world<br />i think it actually built the openwrt from scratch, ecause it downloaded gcc and linux kernel (about 80 mb, and all the sources for the required packages<br />in the end, it built the firmware images, and among them i found what i needed - the uni file<br />I flashed it via the failsafe webui<br />8) it worked, my first firmware imagebuilt from scratch.</p><p>Note: i think it is pretty safe flashing the uni files.<br />I&#039;ll test the qos, and i&#039;lll give you some feedback.<br />I&#039;ll put the image smewhere so you can downoad it.<br /><span class="bbu"><strong>maybe you guys can help improuve this tutorial inserting/correcting some steps, eventually with the option to install the webif or odher packages.</strong></span></p><p>also check out<br /><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=16599">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=16599</a><br />and<br /><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=9180">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=9180</a><br />and<br /><a href="https://svn.openwrt.org/wiki/GetSource">https://svn.openwrt.org/wiki/GetSource</a></p><p>and i&#039;ll put some other links later</p><p>I think that compiling firmware images in .uni format from svn developpement trunk and from scratch with make V=99 is the best solution.</p><p>regards</p><p>I didn&#039;t get the n speed</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fratzicu</strong> on 10 Apr 2009, 12:00)</p>

					<p>OK,At the end of this post you&#039;ll find the link for my google site dedicated to OpenWRT Kamikaze firmware compiling. That page contains also some compiled packages for the latest kernel. Some of them were missing from the x-wrt snapshot page.</p><p>The only errors now are:<br />1) ip_tables: (C) 2000-2006 Netfilter Core Team<br />nf_conntrack version 0.5.0 (512 buckets, 2048 max)<br />CONFIG_NF_CT_ACCT is deprecated and will be removed soon. Please use<br />nf_conntrack.acct=1 kernel paramater, acct=1 nf_conntrack module option or<br />sysctl net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_acct=1 to enable it.<br />2) can&#039;t load conntrack support for proto=24<br />can&#039;t load conntrack support for proto=24<br />can&#039;t load conntrack support for proto=24<br />can&#039;t load conntrack support for proto=24<br />3) UDP: bad checksum.

I guess it&#039;s because of the download and upload link speed settings which I don&#039;t quite know how to set.</p><p>Next, I&#039;ll try compiling with the webif2</p><p><a href="http://sites.google.com/site/fratzicu/">http://sites.google.com/site/fratzicu/</a></p><p>Regards</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Glad it could help. I was compiling so many packages times, because I wanted to have:<br />1)basic configuration, preferably with webif2, miniupnpd, qos, openvpn, cifs and transmission. It seems I succeeded with:<br />a)Kamikaze-(r15213)-webif2light-cifs-transmission-openvpn-12-04-2009<br />b)Kamikaze-(r15213)-madwifi-webif2-cifs-transmission-openvpn-12-04-2009<br />c)Kamikaze-(r15213)-madwifi-luci-cifs-transmission-openvpn-12-04-2009<br />I didn&#039;t test them yet. I don&#039;t know yet if madwifi works.</p><p>I&#039;ll try the a) firmware and then the b) one.<br />Cifs works. Basically, I plan to buy a network attached storage. I wonder if mlnet could be compiled to work with OpenWRT.</p><p>Regards.</p>									</div>
