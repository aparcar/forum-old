					<p>I replaced my old router with a (very cheap) Netgear WNR854T - it had everything I needed - an 802.11n to Wired Ethernet to support a small private LAN of wired servers and wireless clients.</p><p>I went with Netgear&#039;s stock firmware, at first, but its refusal to port-forward, to a different class-C subnet, prompted me to re-configure my DHCP and DNS on my Linux server. This went badly - with thousands of incomprehensible error messages and a &gt;95% failure rate to resolve DNS names... but only from Linux.</p><p>After much cursing at utterly opaque documentation, and pursuing many blind alleys, I decided that I most suspected the Netgear firmware was corrupting my DNS traffic.</p><p>After installing OpenWRT on the WNR854T, to my joy, my LAN-side DNS worked flawlessly... but I am now faced with another problem: the OpenWRT&#039;d WNR854T does not recognise the WiFi card in my WNR854T... though wi-fi worked flawlessly before flashing with OpenWRT.</p><p>I followed the installation instructions here:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wnr854t">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wnr854t</a></p><p>And I have read the section about &quot;Wifi Card&quot; - but am finding its advice difficult to interpret. The linked mwl8k git repository:</p><p><a href="http://git.marvell.com/?p=mwl8k.git;a=summary">http://git.marvell.com/?p=mwl8k.git;a=summary</a></p><p>Seems to have versions for Linux 2.6.32 (same as the kernel on the WNR854T) and 3 rc versions for 2.6.33... but I can&#039;t find any install instructions.</p><p>I can see recommendations for other &quot;they sound wrong for my hardware&quot; drivers too - though it&#039;s not clear if these should work with my standard hardware - or if I&#039;d need to change the Wi-fi component to use them. As I bought the WNR854T for peanuts, I&#039;m reluctant to get involved with upgrading hardware or putting up with flaky drivers... especially as they don&#039;t seem to have been touched for 3 years (Is that a bad or good sign?)</p><p>So... in short, my questions are:</p><p>1. Can I get Wi-Fi working with OpenWRT on my WNR854T using existing available software - without altering hardware?<br />2. If I can&#039;t do this easily, what&#039;s the &quot;best&quot; (i.e. will actually work) inexpensive Wi-Fi/Ethernet router that I could buy, reasonably cheaply, to replace my ill advised WNR854T choice?</p><p>Thanks in advance...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sjh641</strong> on 25 Mar 2013, 21:11)</p>

					<p>The factory WiFi card works in STA mode. That&#039;s mean NO AP.<br />I finally replaced the WiFi card with a TL-WN861N, and use ATH9K instead of fight against MWL8K slow development.<br />I miss the fast start/reboot time of that nice router :,(<br />Every other bit of information was left in <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=12358">this thead</a>.

					<p>The mini-PCI card is cheap. Do you really consider exchange a PCI card &quot;hardware hacking&quot;?<br />It&#039;s a nice Gigabit router, pair it with another cheap AP or get the TL-WR1043D as the cheapest Gigabit router.<br />Or wait for 802.11ac to get cheap.<br />Get the TL-WR842ND if you don&#039;t need Gigabit Ethernet.<br />Explore the &quot;toh&quot; yourself, I really don&#039;t know what are you looking for.</p>									</div>

					<p>Many thanks for your expert advice, Nilfred.&nbsp; I think I&#039;ll buy a TL-WR1043ND - it&#039;s well worth the price to me if it &quot;just works&quot;, especially as I&#039;d have to buy a replacement wi-fi card for the Netgear (install it and mess about...&nbsp; I know it&#039;s relatively easy... but I&#039;m frustrated - I want to be spending time on my other projects instead. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>I had thought my needs were &#039;trivial&#039; - Wi-Fi and Ethernet - each as fast and reliable as possible... bridged - supporting port-forwarding and using my existing server for DNS and DHCP - without corrupting/losing traffic.</p><p>Hardware-wise the Rangemax WNR854T looked ideal - until I discovered the Netgear firmware corrupted my DNS requests and the OpenWrt firmware doesn&#039;t support the wireless card in it.</p>									</div>

					<p>instead of a 1043nd&nbsp; i&#039;d go for the&nbsp; tp-wdr4300.&nbsp; It&#039;s dual band (which is going to be a bigger deal over the next few years), has more ram and a faster processor and it&#039;s only like $30 more.</p>									</div>

					<p>Where you guys looks for prices? I can buy 2 1043 for the price of 1 4300 and it doesn&#039;t make me twice as happy.<br />wdr3600 has same processor and there is no known hardware that make good use of the 3rd &quot;spatial multiplexed&quot; antenna.<br />wdr3500 has been recently baked in the OpenWrt oven and is as good as wdr3600.</p>									</div>

					<p>i was just looking at amazon.&nbsp; &nbsp; $50 vs $85&nbsp; &nbsp;3600 would be fine too i guess.&nbsp; &nbsp;I know prices vary from place to place.&nbsp; i&#039;m pretty surprised how cheap the tp-links are since the competing netgear / Asus/ belkin ones are $150+ right now.&nbsp; &nbsp;Though i guess those are 3x3 /3x3&nbsp; so thus &quot;better&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp; But like you said the difference between 2x2 and 3x3 is not so big.&nbsp; (though it is &gt;0 according to&nbsp; tests: <a href="http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/wireless/wireless-reviews/31687-asus-rt-n66u-dark-knight-dual-band-wireless-n900-gigabit-router-reviewed?showall=&amp;start=4">http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/wireless … mp;start=4</a>&nbsp; )</p><p>Can&#039;t really say from personal experience as most of my devices are single stream anyway.</p>									</div>
