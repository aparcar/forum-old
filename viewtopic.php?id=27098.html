					<p>Hi!</p><p>My problem:<br />I bought a cheap TP-LINK wifi router( Didn&#039;t have enough money for good linksys ). <br />What i wanted it to to was to act as a client in wireless network. Problem is that the soft on this router only &quot;knows&quot; connecting via wireless bridge.<br />This is not an option for me...</p><p>So i thought that maybe i can hack it&#039;s firmware to act as a client and share the connection throught cable to my computer. <br />That would be awesome <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /><br />There was one post here about samekind of router but this thread was too messy for me to understand so i made my own.</p><p>It should be possible - it&#039;s just a mini computer with a wifi card and bad software.</p><p>The router is TP-LINK WR340G<br />( ask for more information if needed )</p><p>How do i do it ??</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Klamber</strong> on 26 Oct 2010, 20:38)</p>

					<p>Hm..<br />Thankyou for your replys so far.</p><p>well i opened it and found Atheros chip<br />AR2317 - AC1A </p><p>Googled and found different info... <br />Some say it has 2 MB some say it has 4 MB<br />I am not shure now...</p><p>Ok let&#039;s view it from different angle. It seems to me that i have made a bad choice when buying it. <br />I am disappointed little in the way things are. My Wifi card that is even cheaper can do it and a box that big is so stupid.<br />But i don&#039;t need it.<br />So i was wondering that ok if it can&#039;t run WRT, it still should be able to run a little linux on it ? <br />( like a little playground <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /> )<br />I see there are some images of vmlinuz etc . Can they be used ?</p>									</div>

					<p>With supported routers available for just $30-$35, I would not spend my time for unsupported routers.</p><p>BTW: WR340G probably can be flashed with some custom firmware, without Wi-Fi support.<br />So it would work as pure router (without Wireless Access Point functionality).<br />But I guess that&#039;s not what you want, right?</p><p>Another option you have is to ask on OpenBSD/NetBSD forums or mailing list.<br />May be they have some builds working on such kind of hardware.</p>									</div>
