					<p>my openwrt router&#039;s wan interface is pluged to another router whose dhcp range is 10.10.51.0/24, while the dhcp range of my openwrt is 192.168.1.0/24, when my notebook is connect to openwrt router, i am suprised to find that the&nbsp; ip my notebook get&nbsp; is 10.10.51.11, which is not in the dhcp range of my openwrt router, what&#039;s wrong? i think the ip i get should be in 192.168.1.0/24, since my notebook is connect to my openwrt router, and not other routers, what&#039;s the matter then? is this a bug of openwrt?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jameslord</strong> on 15 Feb 2012, 04:19)</p>
