					<p>Hi, I&#039;m new on this board and I have had this 703n v4 for a while now. I have not had much time to play with it. I installed openwrt in to it and it worked fine. Few day ago I had some free time and I uploaded 703n-video-3g-nas-31270 in to it. That firmware automatically streams webcam feed to http://ip:8080/?action=streamer and provides snapshopt to action=snapshot. My webcam is Logitech C270 HD. Now I have few questions for surveillance use.</p><p>1. Loaded firmware automatically provides 640x480 stream and snapshots. How could I have bigger pictures, as my HD webcam can handle those?<br />2a. If I mount external usb memory to 703n, could I somehow automatically take webcam snapshot/minute and save it to usb mem?<br />2b. If yes, could it be so that over week old snapshots are automatically removed?<br />3. Is it anyway possible to have motion tracking? If camera noticed movement, it automatically saves 2-5min video to external usb?<br />4. Is it possible to stream over wifi? Now I have RJ45 connected from 703n to switch. It would be great if I could only attach 703n to power outlet and don&#039;t have to care if I have RJ45 around or not.<br />5. Could I have ready made firmware that have webcam, usbstorage and possible wifi streaming possibilities? And motion tracking capabilities would make my day!<br />6. Is there any better way to make surveillance system? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Thanks for advance and sorry about my not so good English <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>PS. I&#039;ve just ordered USB hub and I think that I could mount it inside box like in this thread: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=34188">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=34188</a></p>									</div>

					<p>I haven&#039;t yet done it with the 703N, but yes to all of your questions.&nbsp; I have openwrt streaming wirelessly using mjpg-streamer, with the stream fed to the internet here: <a href="http://www.lyzby.com/cam.html">http://www.lyzby.com/cam.html</a></p><p>This setup is with an NSLU2 running openwrt controlling the camera, and wired to a WRT54G which makes the wireless link from the location in the barn to my network in the house.&nbsp; A single device like the 703n (with a hub) should work for this now.&nbsp; The camera is a Logitech Quickcam Pro 9000 which streams at 1600x1200.&nbsp; </p><p>You can check the documentation here:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.picaxeforum.co.uk/showthread.php?13705-Rivercam-with-PICAXE-pan-tilt-control">http://www.picaxeforum.co.uk/showthread … lt-control</a></p><p>And here:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.picaxeforum.co.uk/showthread.php?9425-Pan-and-tilt-control-of-webcam-with-PICAXE-08M">http://www.picaxeforum.co.uk/showthread … PICAXE-08M</a></p><p>I have used motion to detect motion and snap shots, and have also used motion to take a shot every 30 seconds.&nbsp; I set up cron jobs to zip the files and also to delete files more than a week old.&nbsp; With a large usb drive you could save a lot of snapshots.</p><p>None of this is ready-made, and I don&#039;t know of a better way to make a surveillance system (depending on your definition of &quot;better&quot; and assuming that costs need to be kept to a minimum).</p>									</div>
