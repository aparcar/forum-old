					<p>I have recently built a new router to replace my ageing Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH, an ar71xx platform. By comparison, the new machine is a brute. It is an x86_64 Intel Rangeley C2558 SoC with 16GB RAM running on a <a href="http://www.supermicro.nl/products/motherboard/Atom/X10/A1SRi-2558F.cfm">Supermicro A1SRi-2558F</a> motherboard.</p><p>I have two wireless cards in the new machine. One is a <a href="http://www.compex.com.sg/productdetailinfo.asp?model=WLE350NX&amp;acc1Panel=1">Compex WLE350NX</a> (ath9k) 802.11a/b/g/n 2/5Ghz, while the other is a <a href="http://www.zcomax.co.uk/products/index.php/products/wlan-module/802-11ac-minipci-e-module">Z-com AC-920</a> (ath10k). These are both plugged into a <a href="http://routerboard.com/RB14e">Mikrotik RB14e</a> mini PCI-e to PCI-e adapter.</p><p>I&#039;m currently testing the Compex card, an AR9580 based card. I have setup my new router using the same 20Mhz wide channel as the Buffalo. Since this is a 3x3 card with 3x 12dB antennae attached and pushing out 20dbm of txpower as opposed to the 17dbm from the Buffalo, I was expecting better performance. </p><p>But alas no. The performance is awful. Unusable. 10x slower than the Buffalo from a machine 30cm away from the router. Uploading a 10GB file using ftp to the new router (it has a writeable SSD inside), I&#039;m getting 150KB/s on the new machine as opposed to 1,300KB/s on the Buffalo. </p><p>Looking at the interface statistics shows high retries and a substantial number of fails. </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Station 28:18:78:d0:17:47 (on wlan1)

					<p>My guess is 12+20 dBm for a 30 cm distance is way too much, and creates a lot of interference.<br />Try to reduce TX power to somewhere around 0-5 dBm.</p><p>Wireless throughput doesn&#039;t magically get better just because tx power and antenna gain are pumped.</p>									</div>

					<p>The machine is really only so close because I&#039;m testing, but I did try to both lower the txpower and move the client away, but it didn&#039;t have much effect. Good idea though...</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m cautiously optimistic that this problem is fixed or at least much improved.</p><p>Trunk r40420 contains a large number of patches to hostapd, ath9k and mac80211. Previously a &quot;iw dev wlan1 station dump&quot; showed tx retries that were frequently several times the number of packets transmitted and &quot;cat of /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phy1/ath9k/ani&quot; revealed hundreds of ani resets and hundreds of thousands of OFDM and CCK errors accumulated over the course of 30 minutes. </p><p>After the update, the ani debug file contains no errors and no resets at all. Likewise, much lower tx retries. Speeds seem better. I&#039;ll monitor for a few days, but it appears like this behaviour was due to bugs that have been addressed.</p>									</div>
