					<p>Well, I&#039;m having to exchange the WRT-1900ACS because I accidentally flashed the DD from today built that unbeknownst to be does not include DHCP, TFTP, or Luci. So I couldn&#039;t even flash the right build (davidc502&#039;s build) that includes Luci and udhcpc. Oops.</p><p>I don&#039;t have a spudger handy so I couldn&#039;t access the serial port, and I didn&#039;t want to break the case.</p><p>Has anybody else had a similar experience?</p>									</div>

					<p>You should be able to ssh to the device.<br />You should be able to tri-power cycle to the last image.<br />With DD you will need to ssh in and opkg update, opkg install luci, as luci is not there out of the box.</p><p>Edit: Things are fairly well documented on the wiki:<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1900ac">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1900ac</a><br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1900acs">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1900acs</a></p><p>dhcp is from dnsmasq which if actually was not in the build would be very surprising.<br />You can always assign a static ip on the machine attached to the router i.e. 192.168.1.5<br />The last good image, i.e. the partition from which you flashed the none working image, should be there.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>anomeome</strong> on 29 Dec 2015, 02:07)</p>

					<p>no luci (and no wifi) is normal (in trunk builds). As anomeome said, ssh to 192.168.1.1, and configure from there.<br />ideally just connect your machine via the wan link to your old router (it will pick up a dhcp adress from the old router and use that for internet access, and conncet your laptop via the lan port of your new router.<br />then ssh in, and run opkg update and opkg install luci. after that you can log in via the webinterface, and finish the configuration.</p>									</div>

					<p>You pays your money, you takes your chances.

I&#039;d say that everyone is pretty safe from getting one that is flashed-out. lol </p><p>Heck, if I flashed once a week (ave), and at the most conservative estimates, would be something like 500 years? NAND flash is what SSD drives are made from, and are designed to be erased and written many times.</p>									</div>
