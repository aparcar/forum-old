					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have installed Backfire 10.3 on my TP-Link WR1043ND. I did both BIN files (factory and sysupgrade) and everything worked well.</p><p>Then I decided to &#039;Setting up a DMZ&#039;. I followed the documentation but I must have made a mistake. I can not connect to the router any more. No reply to a ping. I must have made a typing error. I started to look on the forum and found topic <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=11592&amp;p=2">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php â€¦ 92&amp;p=2</a> but this did not work.</p><p>What do I have? I connected the router to a portable. With wireshark I found that the router is &#039;alive&#039;. It does an ARP broadcast to tell him who has a specific IP address. I gave my portable this address and I saw that my portable was replying. The router did not stop and continued to ask the question again and my portable replied. This continued.</p><p>arp -s on my portable works but I still can not ping.</p><p>Is there any way that I can change the file /etc/config/network or flash the firmware? Preferably without hardware modifications ;-) Can I access it in some NETBUI way? Booting with USB? Use the router as a USB stick?</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Marco</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you FYI. I thought I had read all but I must have skipped the <strong>failsafe</strong> part <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> This solved the problem. I could access the WR1043ND with <strong>telnet 192.168.1.1</strong> and after executing the <strong>firstboot</strong> script and a reboot I was able to access my WR1043ND again <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p>									</div>
