					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I saw several posts with people saying they succedded to first flash their MZK-W04NU via the original Planex web interface. But I never succeeded. I tried from all different available Planex firmwares (from 1.00.03 to 1.03.23) but still impossible. I tried tftp at boot but seems it can&#039;t work.</p><p>I tried to flash with the firmware openwrt_r14959_manyUSB1_ar71xx-mzk-w04nu-squashfs.webui and openwrt_r14959_manyUSB1_ar71xx-mzk-w04nu-squashfs.bin from this page : <a href="http://sites.google.com/a/roundsparrow.com/openwrt_ap81/">http://sites.google.com/a/roundsparrow. â€¦ nwrt_ap81/</a></p><br /><p>Did someone succeeded ?

					<p>Well, I answer to myself (the night was long !)</p><p>After comparing official firmwares to openWRT ones with an hex editor, I could figure out why it was not working.</p><p>MZK-W04NU firmwares seems to have a constant size, whatever you decide to include inside. The generated .webui openWRT firmware size was 7,798,818 bytes where the official one was 7,864,320 bytes.</p><p>The actual process is the following :</p><p>1. Padd with 0x00 the .uImage kernel to reach 1,441,792 bytes (dd bs=1408k conv=sync)<br />2. Padd with 0x00 the .squashfs file to reach 6,356,992 bytes (dd bs=6208k conv=sync)<br />3. Concatenate the 2 above files (.uImage + .squashfs = .bin). We now have the .bin file<br />4. Add the Planex header (34 bytes) using (mkplanexfw). We now have the .webui file</p><p>1,441,792 + 6,356,992 + 34 = 7,798,818 bytes. 65,502 bytes were missing in the target/linux/ar71xx/image/Makefile in order the firmware could be uploaded via the Planex http interface :</p><p>5. Padd with 0x00 the .webui image to reach 7,864,320 bytes (dd if=.webui bs=7680k sync=conv of=.webui2)</p><p>After that, I could upload the firmware successfully.</p><p>Note : The last padd must be done AFTER the Planex header writing, if done before, the header won&#039;t be accepted by Planex GUI.</p><p>After that, I could begin to play. Unfortunately, I made a mistake when uploading a new firmare with mtd and I briked it. I just bought a 3.99 euro Nokia cable.</p><p>Note sure how to upload a new firmare with mtd for the lastesk trunk version. Anyone can help about that ?</p><p>Thanks !</p>									</div>

					<p>jintao,</p><p>Unfortunately, you are correct to the best of my knowledge. Boot_delay only controls the seconds that uboot waits for serial input before performing the default boot action. Uboot does not have any tftp server support, as would be needed for a &quot;push tftp&quot; reflash.</p><p>This is really too bad, as the need to hook up a serial line is all that prevents this board from being the perfect openwrt platform.</p><p>However, here is something that might help reduce the pain of doing a &quot;pull tftp&quot; flash via serial console. Uboot can can run simple scripts from environment variables. So here is what I use to automate the process instead of typing the commands in by hand every time:</p><br /><p>filesize=770000<br />fileaddr=A0800000<br />imageaddr=bf050000<br />filename=openwrt-ar71xx-mzk-w04nu-squashfs.bin<br />loadtftp=tftp 0x${fileaddr} ${filename}<br />wipeflash=erase 0x${imageaddr} +0x${filesize}<br />copyflash=cp.b 0x${fileaddr} 0x${imageaddr} 0x${filesize}<br />flashimage=run loadtftp; run wipeflash; run copyflash; reset</p><p>Then you just need to set ipaddr and serverip to correct values for your network. At the serial console prompt, you can type &quot;run flashimage&quot; and it will flash from the tftp server.</p><p>Edit: Oh yeah. Put these in using setenv. For example:<br />setenv loadtftp=&quot;tftp 0x${fileaddr} ${filename}&quot;</p><p>Once you are satisfied (use printenv to check for typos), you can use saveenv to put these into flash.</p><p>Uboot doesn&#039;t deal well with backspace characters, so I suggest writing this up in a text editor before hand and pasting it into the console.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>thalience</strong> on 17 Nov 2009, 20:03)</p>

We first tftp the firmware image file into ram, then wipe flash, and finally copy the firmware into flash.</p><p>The &quot;firmware&quot; mtd partition overlaps all of the kernel, squashfs and jffs2 partitions. It represents &quot;the area we need to flash with the firmware file&quot;. So the start of the kernel partition (0xbf050000) is <span class="bbu">also</span> the start of the firmware partition. There is no difference between flashing with mtd under linux and flashing the same firmware image file with uboot. Both overwrite the same flash areas.</p><p>Now, actually there is one potential difference between the two methods. Mtd is capable of being smarter than just writing a file into an area of flash. It can interpret the firmware image being written and integrate data into the empty jffs2 area. This is how the sysupgrade script (and webui) is able to preserve settings over a firmware upgrade.</p><p>But the default method with mtd is still to just write the raw file to flash.</p>									</div>
