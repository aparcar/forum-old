					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a question that I&#039;ve been trying to solve for the past few days to no avail.</p><p>I have a 6-to-4 tunnel from HE. There is the standart /64 network for the tunnel and I also have a /48 network. I would like to basically daisy chain two OpenWRT routers.</p><p>Right now I can assign a /64 (from the /48 prefix) network to my LAN and it works pretty much as expected. I would like to however connect another OpenWRT router and assign another /64 segment to that.</p><p>I VLAN-ed one of the switch ports of the primary gateway (where the 6-to-4 tunnel is installed) and I can assign a second /64 network to that. That kinda works. However I have another interface on the second router that I would like to end up having a /64 network also that is routable.</p><p>It will look something like this:</p><p>Router 1:</p><p>---&gt;6-to-4 (with /48 prefix) - LAN1 a /64 prefix&nbsp; (this works) - 2001:470:cccc:1::/64<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- LAN2 a /64 (or should it be /127 prefix) for Router-to-Router communication (this one is another /64 segment) - 2001:470:cccc:2::/64 (or /127 I&#039;m not really sure)</p><p>Router 2:</p><p>---&gt; R2R interface (sort of WAN, this is the LAN2 of GW1 to R2R (eth0) interface of Router 2) - 2001:470:cccc:2::/64 (ideally autoconfigured if /64, but /127 would work with static addresses I think, but I suppose I have to write my routing table by hand)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- iface2 (think of it as WiFi) with a /64 prefix - 2001:470:cccc:3::/64</p><p>I can configure all of that, however I do seem to think this will not work as expected because I don&#039;t know how to setup RA, NDP, etc. Also I&#039;m not sure if in a setup like that, all addresses will end up globally routable. Should I think of OSPF or will RA/NDP do it&#039;s job? I&#039;m a bit lost when it comes to IPv6, as the protocol is both very simple and straight forward, but very different from IPv4, where we had NAT, assigning IPs by hand and taking care of collisions, etc.</p><p>Any advice from someone well versed in IPv6 would be welcome, also some reading materials would also help me, although I pretty much learned the RFCs and the Linux IPv6 howto by hard already and I still get lost as you can see.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ilf</strong> on 26 Mar 2016, 20:58)</p>

					<p>Unless, you need to have the routers directly connected, I would suggest a simpler topology:<br />HE 6to4 tunnel-----&gt;R1------LAN1 cccc:1/64------R2-------LAN2 cccc:2/64</p><p>Router 2 (R2) can share the LAN1 with the hosts. Everything is a /64, which makes it easy.</p><p>Then it is just a matter of statically configuring the IPv6 addresses on the upstream and downstream interfaces of R2 (I assume you have R1 working). </p><p>Lastly, you will need to manually put in routes, R2, needs a default route pointing to R1, and R1 needs a cccc:2/64 route pointing at R2, so that packets will be sent to R2 for LAN2.</p><p>If you wanted to use a routing protocol, I would suggest RIPng, rather than OSPF. Much easier to setup, and in small networks, it just works.</p><p>HTH</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, thanks for the reply, I actually completely misunderstood the concept at the beginning, but after finally drew everything on a sheet of paper, I found my mistakes. Unfortunately /64 is just not sufficient for what I&#039;m implementing.</p><p>This is not a production environment, we are simulating a real life scenario where we might end up with thousands of nodes, all on not very common Layer 1 interfaces and IPv6 is our glue.</p><p>I split my networks depending what I wanted to do in either /64 or /60 segments. So far everything works perfectly even with this cascading setup of routers. Thanks for this puzzle I now have a complete understanding of IPv6 network typologies and I&#039;m starting to hate IPv4, with all of it&#039;s idiosyncrasies and complexities <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p>									</div>

					<p>Good to hear you have things working. You want to keep your host networks (the ones with PCs on them) as /64s.</p><p>You probably have already figured this out, but with IPv6, it isn&#039;t how many hosts you want to put on your network, but how many networks do you need, when doing your IPv6 planning. My ISP gives me a /56, which gives me 255 networks just in my house (so far, I am only using 3). </p><p>Hurricane Electric will give you a /48, or 65,000 networks. </p><p>Have fun!</p>									</div>

					<p>If possible avoid more than one router on a single L2 subnet.<br />But in some cases its not very convinient.<br />For example, I use the following :</p><p>inet &lt;&gt; R1 &lt;&gt; LAN &lt;&gt; R2 &lt;&gt; WIFI</p><p>LAN and WIFI subnets have different ipv4 and ipv6 prefixes.<br />WIFI has one router and always can reach any host.<br />for R1 to reach WIFI static route required<br />for LAN to reach wifi extra steps are required.<br /> ipv4 : advertise route to WIFI via DHCP. easy to configure, works for all devices.<br /> ipv6 : need router advertisements from R2. odhcpd cant do that !! radvd required, its absent in packages and need own compilation. Disable odhcpd on LAN, enable RADVD on LAN, add firewall rule to prevent self configuration from RADVD (it will add bad routes). Also for linux devices in LAN sysctl needed or they won&#039;t accept extra ipv6 route</p><p>Too complex, isnt it ?<br />But its worth doing if physical topology suggests<br />No doubt I could have single bridged subnet. But I wanted it routed <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />For example, to be able to easily control and limit wifi traffic with iptables. iptables do not work for bridges and net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1 on my device caused kernel panics.<br />Also I wished to be sure no broadcasts and multicasts from LAN polute the air.<br />Another option would be using ipv6 pseudo bridge. It works but causes 1 second delays for neighbor discovery</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bolvan</strong> on 14 Apr 2016, 09:53)</p>

R1 will &quot;feed&quot; a prefix to R2 to use on the WIFI. Because it &quot;fed&quot; the prefix, there is no static route needed (since that will be put into R1 automagically). By letting your downstream routers obtain prefixes from the upstream routers, everything just kind of magically works, for IPv6. I have tested this with 15.05, and it works quite well.</p><p>For IPv4, you have to do a bit more work. You can run double NAT (at R1 and R2), or you can not NAT at R2 and let it just route, but then you have to distribute routes yourself (from R1 to R2).</p><p>If you are planning to scale this up to many routers (more than a few), then I would recommend running a routing protocol like IS-IS or RIPng (for IPv6) and let it do the work.</p><p> </p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>For example, to be able to easily control and limit wifi traffic with iptables. iptables do not work for bridges and net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1 on my device caused kernel panics.</p></blockquote></div><p>Hmm, I have created a bridging firewall for IPv6, where I use &quot;sysctl -w net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables=1&quot; with no kernel panic.

					<p>Another thought would be to investigate the Homenet package. It&#039;s designed to automatically configure all these things between routers.
