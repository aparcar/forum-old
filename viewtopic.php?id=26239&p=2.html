					<p>Yes but you people here must understand one thing. I, for example have the Sky ( a ISP from the UK ) version of this Netgear router and it has loads of locked out things to prevent unauthorised firmware and all that stuff. It has a green PCB. I used the modified version of NFTP to bypass the checksum verification when uploading firmware. If you have the blue PCB then things may be different. You may even have another type of wireless card. My one for example, has an Atheros removable card but it loads the b43 driver strangely ! In summary, you need to be sure which version of the Netgear you have and what type of wireless device !</p>									</div>
