					<p>I have several remote ar71xx routers all running OpenWrt r38987 with Tinc 1.0.23 in Router mode. This custom build of OpenWrt is rock solid, as is Tinc... on all but one of my routers. On the problem router, Tinc starts up just fine and connects to other nodes. But as soon as I try to make a connection (ssh, http, ping, whatever) to or from the problem node, OpenWrt crashes on that node and immediately reboots. None of the other routers are affected by the event.</p><p>I&#039;ve gone over my settings again and again, reset the system with firstboot, reinstalled tinc &amp; other kernel modules, but nothing helps. The crazy thing is that just last week, this problem router was working fine - tinc and otherwise. Could this be an issue with the Comcast service or hardware at the problem site?</p><p>I&#039;m happy to provide version/config data, or anything that will help.</p><p>Thanks,<br />wbr</p><p>EDIT: I eventually concluded that it was not a Tinc/OpenWrt issue, as I have both working well on several other routers. It may have been a low-memory problem. This particular router only has 8Mb of flash, and I think I was just running too much on it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wbr</strong> on 28 Apr 2014, 04:49)</p>
