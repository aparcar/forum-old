					<p>I&#039;ve just had a d-link 502T come into my possession. I&#039;m currently looking to upgrade as it doesn&#039;t suit my needs as an adsl 2+ router.</p><p>So I figure I&#039;ll have something spare to mess around with.</p><p>I&#039;m thinking of making a wireless stereo system, the only problem being, It doesn&#039;t have a wireless interface. Does the USB on the 502T host devices?, or does the router only act as a device over USB?.</p><p>Any info on this device would be appreciated.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rockofclay</strong> on 8 Nov 2007, 15:01)</p>
