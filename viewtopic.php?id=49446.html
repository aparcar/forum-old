					<p>Hi,<br />I&#039;m a new one on this forum and this matter as well. Sorry if somebody already asked the same, but I couldn&#039;t find a solution regarding to my problem. So, the situation is as following: <br />I subscribed for IPTV over my ADSL modem and now I have internet &amp; IPTV together through the phone line. My ISP gave me STB riciviever and that part works fine. They also offer a additional STB for second TV but they are giving support if you connect ADSL modem and STB receiver by eth cable which is not suitable for me. I bought new router TP Link TL 941ND v.5 (maybe I shouldn&#039;t) and I&#039;ve been wasting 2-3 weeks to establish the connection without any success. First I tried with the original software and after that I installed Open Wrt&nbsp; Attitude Adjustment 12.09 which is still running on. I&#039;m not interesting (so far) to use the new router for the internet but IPTV only even it means that I need additional new router to establish wifi connection instead of cable. <br />So my question is whether that is possible and how I should configure my router(s) to achieved this?<br />I&#039;ll repeat that I tried a lot of things, had to make failsafe a hundred of times (thanks God it&#039;s still alive) and now it&#039;s driving me crazy. <br />Can it be done with original TP Link firmware?<br />Thanks in advance</p>									</div>

					<p>Your router doesn&#039;t have an ATM interface. You have a separate ADSL modem for that. Remove the atm-bridge section and use eth0 as the wan interface.</p>									</div>
