					<p>Yes, we are behind. Kaloz has two new servers to configure, but he has been waiting on me to let him know which virtualization platform we should go with, and the state of virtualization on Debian based distros is &quot;interesting&quot; to say the least. I spent several weeks with mbm trying to track down a Xen instability while also testing KVM to see if it would provide decent performance, (not decent enough.) We resolved the Xen problem roughly a week ago and I was able to switch back to working on the impending release. XOrg is building on all platforms, it has been a major PITA to debug, two days ago I asked thepeople and blogic to help working on that. thepeople and myself have been preparing ipkg and opkg for committing, we will be switching to one of them for the release as busybox ipkg is broken and this is the more time expedient solution.&nbsp; nbd has been committing madwifi and boot fixes like a madman.</p><p>There are several major patches are being testing, but as the feature freeze date has come and gone I don&#039;t know if they will be included in 8.08 or will have to wait until 8.08+1.

					<p>You can tell people have been doing a lot of work to get the latest release ready.

I am quite grateful for openwrt since its allowed me to get networking to my shed reliably vs the crap dlink bridges I had tried to use in the past, and it also reliably lets me roam between the accesspoints at each end of the link, unlike the crappy powerline networking I used in the past. All up pretty good for something that was at no cost and supported in their spare time by a team of pretty damn talented (IMO) people.</p>									</div>

					<p>I agree with posters&#039; suggestions that it would be nice to update the announcement posted at openwrt.org that intended release dates have slipped, but really, it would only be &quot;nice,&quot; not somehow mandatory.&nbsp; Openwrt.org and derivative projects like X-Wrt and Kamikaze are noble volunteer projects that contribute much to the open hardware community, and they&#039;re clearly in need of more volunteers.</p><p>If it helps others, my current difficulty with Kamikaze v7.09 exhibiting a bad memory leak when I try to run the QOS scripts on a Fonera 2100 router has lead me to hunt down newer copies of the Openwrt codebase elsewhere.&nbsp; In particular, this page German explaining how to install the Funkfeuer OLSR meshing software on Fonera...<br /><a href="http://wiki.freifunk-hannover.de/Fonera_mit_OLSR">http://wiki.freifunk-hannover.de/Fonera_mit_OLSR</a><br />...and it links to someone&#039;s unofficial Openwrt repository here...<br /><a href="http://ipkg.k1k2.de">http://ipkg.k1k2.de</a>/</p><p>This repo appears to contain updated Openwrt firmware images for the Fonera with the 2.6.24 kernel (Kamikaze v7.09 uses 2.6.21, by comparison), although the ipkg repository itself looks outdated.&nbsp; I hope to test these newer images on the Fonera soon, and can report back to this forum (or elsewhere) for those interested.</p>									</div>

And having no current and complete documentation for the (build) system does not help either.<br />But this is not a problem special to OpenWRT, it is a general problem of many open source projects (and many closed source projects). Writing documentation is always the least favoured part. I recently tried using GnuCash for online banking, and it seems that this program assumes you have serious background in accounting (and the documentation wasn&#039;t better ... ).</p><p>But I don&#039;t claim to be better, I am also often putting it off in favour of adding new features. And while writing good documentation for other users who have experience in the field isn&#039;t easy, writing documentation for the casual user is much harder.</p><p>It also isn&#039;t that easy to be a volunteer tester for openwrt, as probably many use their router as their main router, and can&#039;t just test builds every few days or just make an upgrade/downgrade (as it is possible in normal linux distributions). At least I have only one router which needs to be running (I am not the one connected to it). So the best I can do is test packages, but not fixes/changes for the kernel.</p><p>But back to topic: OpenWRT-next (lets call it that <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> is done when it&#039;s done, and not earlier.</p>									</div>
