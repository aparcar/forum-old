					<p>I have a WRT54G V8 router that has all lan/wan lights lit on it.<br />I am able to flash / erase via JTAG cable but can&#039;t not get a ping no matter what I do.<br />Tried running a constant ping while rebooting router and never got a single reply on any of the ports.<br />When plugging into the lan ports on router computer will never show a lan connecton.<br />Last thing I tried was loading vxworkskillerv8.bin with same results as above.<br />If I am understanding the forum correctly you load vxworkskillerv8.bin then after the reboot<br />load dd-wrt.v24_micro_wrt54gv8 via lan connection 192.168.1.1 </p><p>But I never get a ping.</p>									</div>
