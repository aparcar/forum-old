					<p>Great!! thank you very much Vincent!</p><p>One more question still: is there a problem or warning with the hardware versions to be taken on account?</p><p>Some of them are v2.0 and some are v2.2 I want to upgrade to experimental or whiterussian (what&#039;s the difference?). Should both work?</p><p>Last thing; any suggestions on how to do it in the cleanest way? Right now, I have cron executing a script which downlads a second script from my server and execute it. This way I can make automatic upgrades just by making the script with the commands I need. This second script also has a little vesioning system in order not to re-execute upgrades. But it has falied in some cases if the conection was interrupted. I guess doing it with ipkg would be more safe?</p><p>Thanks again</p><p>Iurgi Arginzoniz</p>									</div>

In this way you don&#039;t have the &quot;connection interrupt&quot; point of failure in the procedure as u upload everything in one step and then is everything full automated... just a bit more work at the beginning to plan, deploy and deeply test everything, but then you rock 350 units in a few minutes...</p><p>Or, if you do it issueing commands from remote, use screen, to avoid the tty loss while the script is running...</p><p>(hoping to understood what you said, sorry for my poor english)</p><p>ciao</p><p>Renton78</p>									</div>

					<p>thanks vincent and mbm</p><p>Vincent: yes, I&#039;ve done it from a 192.168.1.0/24 ip. I now it&#039;s a typical silly mistake, thanks for the warning. Still doesn&#039;t work.</p><p>mbm: thank you to for the notes. I don&#039;t need to kkep jffs2 info. What I want to do is a completely new installation. I&#039;m preparing a custom image with everything I need. I want to place it in all my boxes and delete every previous thing.</p><p>So, to sum up: <br />- I build the image, put it with scp and flash it.<br />- Then mtd erase nvram.<br />- firstboot<br />- set the nvrams they way I want them.<br />- reboot.</p><p>should that work? I mean, would that be a valid way to upgrade my boxes without need of any physical access to them?</p><p>thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>yissnn</strong> on 13 Jul 2005, 14:58)</p>
