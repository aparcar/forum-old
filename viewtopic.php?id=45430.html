					<p>Hello, I need to radios so to use one just to connect to a remote wifi internet signal provider and the other one works as AP. No, I don&#039;t want to use wireless repeater function. So I need 2 radios. I was thinking if those very cheap ~25 USD wifi router with USB could be used so to connect a realtek rtl8186 USB adapter to operate as the 1st or 2nd radio. If so, what product suggestions do you give me? thank you very much</p>									</div>
