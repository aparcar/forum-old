					<p>Hi guys, recently i&#039;ve moved to DD-WRT to OpenWRT and i must admit, i really like it. I&#039;ve failed to activate IPV6 on DD-WRT but with OpenWRT it works like charm.</p><p>Anyway, atm i&#039;m using OpenWrt Backfire 10.03.1 and it&#039;s ok. Still, i wanted to compile my own image fw from the trunk to be up-to-date. Now the problems arise...<br />I&#039;ve used the informations from :http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence, to get the latest trunk sources... all went fine. Latest trunk is #31059.</p><p>I launch <strong>make menuconfig</strong>, </p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://img594.imageshack.us/img594/3117/20120324100639.jpg" alt="http://img594.imageshack.us/img594/3117/20120324100639.jpg" /></span></p><p>I modify only Target System and Target Profile, like in the pic. I also add radvd / wide-dhcpv6-client / kmod-ipv6 / LuCI. These i want to be build into the image. After all this, i&#039;ve saved and exited OpenWRT menuconfig. On the exit, i&#039;ve seen the below warnings in the console:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[ionut@localhost trunk]$ make menuconfig
tmp/.config-package.in:14822:warning: &#039;select&#039; used by config symbol &#039;PACKAGE_deluge-ui-gtk&#039; refer to undefined symbol &#039;PACKAGE_python-gtk&#039;

#
# using defaults found in .config</code></pre></div><p>... typed MAKE.. and after 1h30m, the image was built. Installed on my router the default Linksys firmware and tried to upgrade to my new compiled FW, named: openwrt-ar71xx-generic-wrt160nl-squashfs-factory.bin. I had no luck, it gave me an error like, Upgrade failed. I said ok, let&#039;s try another aproach.</p><p>I&#039;ve upgraded my router to OpenWrt Backfire 10.03.1, then tried to install my compiled openwrt-ar71xx-generic-wrt160nl-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin. This time the upgrade process was ok but after the reboot, my router won&#039;t boot anymore..... That&#039;s not the problem, i&#039;ve managed to revive him with &quot;tftp -i 192.168.1.1 PUT code.bin&quot; ( with latest Linksys FW ).</p><p>My question is, why my compiled img didnt want to boot? What i did wrong?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p><p>PS: Sorry for the wall of text...<br />PPS: I&#039;ve tried to compile the OpenWRT, on two different linux destros ( openSUSE 12.1, Fedora 16 ), same results...</p>									</div>
