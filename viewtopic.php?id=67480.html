					<p>Hi. </p><p>In the GUI I&#039;ve made a config change, changing </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>wireless.cfg043579</code></pre></div><p>to </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>wireless.cfg043579.hidden=1</code></pre></div><p>. The blue label &quot;Unsaved changes&quot; appear on the top right of the screen, and when I click that and then click &quot;Save and apply&quot;, the staus updates and says that it&#039;s saving the changes to /etc/config/network and finally &quot;Configuration applied&quot;, but the &quot;Unsaved changes&quot; blue label is still there. </p><p>It seems like the changes are stored in the GUI, but gone after a reboot. </p><p>The /etc/config/network doesn&#039;t contain any lines with the word &quot;wireless&quot;, so the config changes I pasted in above (snipped from the &quot;Unsaved changes&quot; screen), seems to try and make changes to /etc/config/network, which fails possibly due to the fact that that file doesn&#039;t contain any wireless settings. </p><p>Any suggestions on what may be wrong here? </p><p>Greetings,<br />kenneho</p><p>EDIT: I should add that I&#039;m running OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05.1.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kenneho</strong> on 10 Sep 2016, 21:21)</p>
