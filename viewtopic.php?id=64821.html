					<p>Hi all,<br />I&#039;m looking for suggestions about a miniPCI wifi adapter to purchase and replace my existing RT2661T-based one.<br />On A226M, in combination with kmod-rt61-pci, it performs really bad and ends up jamming the whole box.</p><p>Any suggestions about a miniPCI wifi adapter performing decently in openwrt to replace my current one will be welcome <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>yes, it&#039;s that unit. I extensively tested Attitude Adjustment and Chaos Calmer, and tried Barrier Breaker obtaining always the same result.<br />The wifi works but has really poor performances, ie. less than 5Mb throughput. When there is some wifi traffic, the log is populated by these messages:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ieee80211 phy0: rt61pci_txdone: Warning - TX status report missed for entry 18</code></pre></div><p>I use the wifi as wan uplink in client mode and what makes the box hang is the country/txpower settings: when the AP radio signal to which I&#039;m connecting is strong, setting country BO / txpower 30 (bolivia, 30 dBm tx power) will make the driver even increase the logging rate of the above message thus jamming the box.</p><p>I don&#039;t need 5G as I&#039;m connecting to 2.4G only AP&#039;s, and would like not to waste too much money on it.</p><p>I&#039;m not familiar with miniPCI sizes, but in the page you linked there is a pretty detailed image of the motherboard including the miniPCI slot (it reads 81YEA and is not populated by any card in the picture). That is the space available for the card.</p><p> <span class="postimg"><img src="https://wiki.openwrt.org/_media/media/pirelli/a226m_board.jpg" alt="https://wiki.openwrt.org/_media/media/pirelli/a226m_board.jpg" /></span></p>									</div>
