					<p>Hi everyone.</p><p>I want to make a&nbsp; modification, adding an external antennas for this little router. I know nothing about wifi wavelengths, etc. So i need help from you.<br />I want to buy a wifi pigtail connectors and 5dBi antennas.<br />So my question is, can i solder the pigtail wires on green circle, and can i need to cut the existing antenna on PCB on yellow line?<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://s16.postimg.org/5ai33rpat/WT3020.jpg" alt="PunBB bbcode test" /></span></p>									</div>

					<p>Okay, i tried this mod but i think, it doesn&#039;t work properly.<br />I soldered only one external connector&nbsp; (on picture below) and attached yagi antenna on it, and the signal strength wasn&#039;t better(AP 100m far from WT3020 ).<br />So i want to change it back (de-solder the pigtail and use the internal antenna), but i lost this little mount capacitor <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> . So my question is, is this capacitor necessary or can i short the pads?</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://s24.postimg.org/kbho07w1x/IMG_1270.jpg" alt="http://s24.postimg.org/kbho07w1x/IMG_1270.jpg" /></span></p>									</div>

					<p>The purpose of those capacitors is to adjust the pcb antennas impedance to match the impedance of the transceiver (or a regular antenna). So, don&#039;t expect to reach the same signal quality that you&#039;ve had before. And I don&#039;t know about the value of those parts. But I would recommend to resolder your pigtail and this time keep the unshielded part of the center wire as short as possible (1-2 mm). Look at this picture to see how manufacturers solder their pigtails: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/_media/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd-v16.jpg">http://wiki.openwrt.org/_media/toh/tp-l â€¦ nd-v16.jpg</a></p>									</div>

					<p>I am interesting to buy WT3020 but I need to mod external antenna too. It looks like there are 2 mod methods here, cut antenna trace method and desolder cap method. Which one is the best?</p>									</div>

					<p>What about scratching of the solder mask on the groundplan on the sides of the capacitor pads.<br />And then mount a U.FL SMD connector.</p><p>I mean: solder the two ground taps to the, now exposed, ground planes on each side, and solder the input and output taps to the pads for the capacitor.</p><p>In my opinion that should keep the impedance matching with in reasonable levels, and possibly leave you with the ability to use the PCB antenna if you disconnect the U.FL pigtale.<br />(you probably need to find space for the PCB-antenna matching capacitor some place else then).</p><p>RAThomas: It seems you have some experience in this. What is your opinion on my suggested solution?</p>									</div>
