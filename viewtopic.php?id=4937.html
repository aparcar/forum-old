					<p>I thought I&#039;d document the symptoms of a power supply failure in a wrt54g v1.0.&nbsp; It can look suspiciously like bad firmware, but the regular tricks to debrick the router will not help in this case, because it&#039;s not the firmware.&nbsp; It&#039;s actually the power supply.&nbsp; And from reading around the Internet, it seems like these old supplies are starting to go out.</p><p><strong>Symptoms of a bad power supply:</strong></p><p>The power and diag lights may blink very quickly, then all will go dark&nbsp; The power supply cannot supply the juice to get things going.</p><p>The power and diag lights may come on solid, and nothing else.&nbsp; The ethernet lights will not come on when a cable is plugged in.&nbsp; This one looks suspiciously like bad firmware, because the lights come on fully but stay stuck.&nbsp; Actually, the PS can supply enough juice to turn it on, but the board cannot boot - i suspect it&#039;s stuck in a cycle, trying to boot but running out of power.</p><p>In another scenario, the power and diag lights came on solid, and all the ethernet lights flashed (like a normal bootup).&nbsp; Then all the lights flashed again... and again.&nbsp; Same situation as above - stuck in a reboot cycle because the PS cannot supply enough power to boot the board.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Obviously, try a new power supply.&nbsp; It MUST be able to supply the rated power.&nbsp; These routers really need it.&nbsp; If the power supply cannot supply enough juice, the above problems will occur.</p><p>The v1.0 wrt54g needs a 5V supply at 2 amps (or more).&nbsp; I believe v1.1 and above use a 12V, 1 amp supply.&nbsp; You can sometimes find random power supplies at second hand stores.&nbsp; I found one for $2.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t matter if the plug doesn&#039;t fit - cut the old one off your dead power supply and wire it to the new supply.</p><p>If you absolutely can&#039;t find a 5V, 2 amp supply, you could substitute a supply with a little more voltage and a little less current.&nbsp; THIS WILL LIKELY REDUCE THE LIFE OF YOUR ROUTER, and don&#039;t say I didn&#039;t warn you, and use at your own risk, etc.&nbsp; But it may work.&nbsp; I used up to 12V on the router (for a short time) and it seemed to work.&nbsp; A 5V, 2A supply can produce up to 10W.&nbsp; Equivalently, a 10V, 1A supply can produce up to 10W.</p><p>Again, this is just informational.&nbsp; Use at your own risk!</p><p>Enjoy!<br />-Jeff</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jcw</strong> on 23 Mar 2006, 19:07)</p>

					<p>Thanks a lot, jcw ! I recently bought a WRT54G v1.0 on ebay - and when it arrived, it wouldn&#039;t power up. Same exact symptoms. I was getting ready to crack the box open when I found this post.</p><p>Luckily, I also own a NSLU2 - which uses the same 5V/2A power supply. Swapped the WRT PS for the NSLU one - it booted up.</p><p>So now to get a new PS for it . . . as said, thanks for the post - it did indeed help me <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m surprised why this comes up so often, and people seem to think they need the factory replacement wart to fix it. If you lost your CD-player adapter, you would just to Wal-Mart and find a generic that will fit.</p><p>Why do you think electronics stores stock these generic replacement adapters? Because they work.&nbsp; The WRT series uses an M-size connector.&nbsp; Just get one with an end that fits, right voltage, and a wart capable of same or more amperage as original and that&#039;s all you need to worry about.</p>									</div>
