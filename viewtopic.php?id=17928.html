					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am trying to find a wireless router that can run openwrt and has an usb port.</p><p>I found the following two models, both around $40:</p><p>WL-520gU : has 4MB flash / 16MB ram, supported according to the wiki. However, USB 2.0 is broken, it only supports 1.1<br />USR5465 : It is not mentioned on the wiki, however the usr5464 is. US Robotics uses a linux-based firmware and offers the source (+build tools) on their homepage, has USB 2.0</p><p>Which one should I buy? The USR has USB 2.0 and seems to be open source by design, however I cannot find out how much flash/ram it has. Does anyone know where to find this information?<br />Btw: According to the source supplied by USR, it is BCM47xx based.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mndflayr</strong> on 3 Dec 2008, 23:04)</p>

					<p>I have the USR5465. It has 4MB flash and 16MB Ram. You need to patch the source using patches from <a href="http://dongsupark.de/openwrt">http://dongsupark.de/openwrt</a>.<br />I&#039;ve got everything working except wireless. You can find more info. regarding serial ports and minor changes to the source and vlan config on my <a href="http://serialize.wordpress.com/2008/12/10/experiments-with-openwrt-and-usr5465/">blog</a> .</p>									</div>
