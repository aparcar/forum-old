					<p>I&#039;m a month late on this thread, but it popped up in a Google search and I just set up a test device on Charter&#039;s 6rd gateway so I&#039;ll share a little.</p><p>6rd is not the same as 6to4 or 6in4. I don&#039;t think backfire supports 6rd. The kernel isn&#039;t quite new enough, and ip didn&#039;t show 6rd as a possible tunnel type. If you&#039;re feeling adventurous you can grab a trunk build, but don&#039;t do that unless you&#039;re sure you know what you&#039;re getting in to.</p><p>If you do use trunk, I don&#039;t think 6rd support is baked in to the scripts yet (I could be wrong, didn&#039;t look too closely). It does, however, work if you configure it yourself. The posted script will work with a little configuration, and you&#039;ll need to fix up ip6tables a little so that the tunnel gets the same rules as the WAN interface. Once you have the 6rd tunnel up radvd will propagate your IPv6 prefix to the internal network, and devices will pick it up if they&#039;re good IPv6 citizens.</p><p>Note that 6rd gives you an IPv6 prefix that&#039;s based on your IPv4 public address. I can&#039;t say how everything will behave if Charter gives you a new dynamic IP, but they are pretty good about not doing that very often. At a minimum, you wouldn&#039;t be able to rely on the Charter IPv6 range for your own internal network connections and would probably want to assign ULAs for internal use.</p>									</div>

					<p>I actually got the 6rd part working, and got an ip6 assigned by charter.</p><p>I just wasnt sure how to get the router to then assign ip6&#039;s to clients, or how to set one in a second router that gateways (ip4) to another network.</p><p>I was just experimenting anyway, and for now its on the back burner. Maybe when the offer it native I&#039;ll play with it again.</p>									</div>
