					<p>Hello to everyone.</p><p>I am new to the forum, I just subscribed.</p><p>I have one of those DIR-615 routers with the 4MB flash (and 32MB of ram) with the stock 4.14 firmware. I wanted to flash the suggested stable build of OpenWRT to my router, but I am unsure about it having a Web Interface like Luci already built in.</p><p>Since 4MB is kind of limiting, can anyone tell me if I have to install any kind of GUI after the firmware flash, or if this router does not support a GUI at all?</p><p>Thank you</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for the kind and quick answer.</p><p>I read that page previously, that&#039;s why I was worried about not being able to install a GUI.</p><p>Sadly I need it, and I am willing to give up more advanced features, due to the fact that other people need to be able to easily set option on that router.</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenWrt 15.05.1 comes with the LuCi web-GUI and should fit in your 4MB. There won&#039;t be much (any?) free space though. LEDE 17.01.4 probably won&#039;t fit.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tunk</strong> on 19 Jan 2018, 16:26)</p>
