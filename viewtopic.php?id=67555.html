					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have a Board where is only the MT7620n, a RAM and a Flash. No RJ45 Jacks or USB or anything else.</p><p>Shouldn`t I be ably to flash any firmware existing for the Mt7620n on it? Because there is no other peripheral?</p><p>I cannot get any firmware running. I really would like to run wrtnode because I need as much GPIOs as Possible. </p><p>I tried flashing via tftp but it goes only to a certain line while loading the kernel and restarts. Do I have to take care about UBoot configs? Set any partitions? When uploading via tftp I don`t set the address where the Image has to be written. UBoot does it all by itself.</p><p>I sthere a general path I have to follow when flashing openwrt?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
