					<p>Hi, i`ve been learning my way trough Openwrt in the past couple weeks, since i won a pair of Ubiquiti Routerstations to play with. </p><p>They are populated with mikrotik`s R52 cards, which are their rebranded name for compex wlm54g AR5414a card. </p><p>I`ve been running the unit pretty smoothly with the ath5k drivers, since ath9k seems not to support those old chipsets.</p><br /><p>iw command shows the card`s supported frequencies, which is the US frequency chart.</p><p>i tried to change it using &quot;iw reg set BR&quot;, but it is like the card passes the US code to the driver, and you can only restrict from those channels. </p><p>Well, i`m in Brazil, and here we are allowed to go to the channels 12 and 13 of the 2.4 band, so, in theory, i could recompile the ath9k drivers, but i don`t have access to a linux box, so i wondered if anybody else has a workarround for this?</p><br /><p>Regards!</p>									</div>

					<p>Dear Carrapato,</p><p>Did you try installing Ubuntu Linux on free VirtualBox VM which can also compile OpenWrt?</p><p>Have a nice day,<br />lion</p>									</div>
