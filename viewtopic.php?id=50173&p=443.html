When I did a &quot;find&quot; for &quot;wireless&quot;, I see that the path does include the &quot;platform&quot; component for:</p><p>/sys/devices/platform/soc/soc:pcie-controller/pci0000:00/0000:00:02.0/0000:02:00.0/net/wlan0/wireless<br />/sys/devices/platform/soc/soc:pcie-controller/pci0000:00/0000:00:03.0/0000:03:00.0/net/wlan1/wireless</p><br /><p>So if I change these paths by hand in /etc/config/wireless and reboot, is that all that I need to do as far as you&#039;re aware? I&#039;m a little leery, since I don&#039;t know why these paths would not be correct if generated by the firmware...</p><p>Update: Doh! Should have known better.../etc/config/wireless is regenerated without the &quot;platform&quot; component by a reboot. I apparently need to do something about how these paths are generated in the first place?</p><p>Update 1: Changed /etc/config/wireless, used &quot;wifi&quot; command to restart wifi, and voila! Luci looking much better. How do I make this permanent across reboots? And again, how can this happen if the firmware generates these paths, and this is a whole new firmware flash? Hmmm...got nothing, here *smile*.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>RogerSC</strong> on 7 May 2016, 02:57)</p>
