					<p>Dear all,</p><p>After reading several WIKI&#039;s forum posts and official how to&#039;s if decided to flash my linksys router. (WRT54GR) </p><p>From these forums I understood that I needed the rdc firmware and that it was working with the Kamikaze rom. </p><p>Nevertheless, I thought, I would try the Backfire (new rom) from which I downloaded the rdc-squashsfs.img file.</p><p>Connecting throuh tftp I issued the following commands:</p><p>binary<br/>rexmt 1<br/>timeout 60<br/>trace<br/>verbose <br/>put openwrt-rdc-squashfs.img</p><p>which outputted something in the order of:<br/>...<br/>sent DATA &lt;block=3322, 512 bytes&gt;<br/>received ACK &lt;block=3322&gt;<br/>sent DATA &lt;block=3323, 512 bytes&gt;<br/>received ACK &lt;block=3323&gt;<br/>sent DATA &lt;block=3324, 512 bytes&gt;<br/>received ACK &lt;block=3324&gt;<br/>sent DATA &lt;block=3325, 512 bytes&gt;<br/>received ACK &lt;block=3325&gt;<br/>sent DATA &lt;block=3326, 512 bytes&gt;<br/>received ACK &lt;block=3326&gt;<br/>sent DATA &lt;block=3327, 512 bytes&gt;<br/>received ACK &lt;block=3327&gt;<br/>sent DATA &lt;block=3328, 512 bytes&gt;<br/>received ACK &lt;block=3328&gt;<br/>sent DATA &lt;block=3329, 4 bytes&gt;<br/>received ACK &lt;block=3329&gt;<br/>Sent 1703940 bytes in 3.4 seconds [4009271 bits/sec]</p><p>After that I rebooted the router, to find out it was not accessible by telnet, http or ssh.</p><p>When the router boots, the power led goes on followed by a flash of ethernet led 1,2,3,4 respectivly and finally a flash of the internet led. </p><p>I do not get an ip address from the router and any attempt to access 192.168.1.1 results in the message&nbsp; &quot;Network is unreachable&quot;</p><p>I have tried a hard 30/30/30 reset, without result.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure what to do next...</p>									</div>

					<p>This is what I found in a similar forum thread (<a href="http://open-wrt.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?id=16563">OpenWRT + Linksys WRT54GR</a>)</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://ranvik.net/privat/router/wrt54gr/pinout.JPG" alt="http://ranvik.net/privat/router/wrt54gr/pinout.JPG"/></span></p><p>I therefor assume that I can solder these cables to the conn1 port and use <a href="http://nuwiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Airlink101/AR525W">this guide</a></p><p>Is this correct? Because in my case it looks like the board has circuitry connections to the JP1 connector.</p><p>From the above mentioned guide it also states that I have both a serial (9pin) as the JTAG(6pin) connector, which one am I supposed to use?</p><p>Regards, Jan</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>JohnieBraaf</strong> on 23 May 2010, 14:51)</p>
