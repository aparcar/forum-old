					<p>Hi</p><p>I have an AR71xx based Nansotation. I would like to be able to use 4.9-6.1 frequencies like the default UBNT distribution has. I tried the patch for compat wireless found here:</p><p><a href="http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-wireless/msg61854.html">http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-wire â€¦ 61854.html</a></p><br /><p>It fails on the last section of the patch and if you take it out the rest of the sections fail. Also the patches for ATH9k are nowhere to be found. Can anyone do a quick fix up? This is a big gaping functionality hole in OPENwrt vs UBNT stock firmware.</p><p>Also, how to extend frequencies to 2.5ghz for BCM43xx devices? I read many 802.11g devices support extended frequencies lower/higher than 2.4.</p><p>Not everyone lives in the US under the thumb of the FCC.</p>									</div>
