					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;ve installed OpenWrt Barrier Breaker 14.07 / LuCI Trunk (0.12+svn-r10530) on my Router Linksys by Cisco WRT160NL:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt160nl">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt160nl</a></p><p>I have successfully added tc and it&#039;s dependencies.</p><p>What I want to do is to have tc netem rules in my local area network. That means two or more computers are connected on different LAN ports at the router and i want to introduce a deterministic loss between them without configuring the computers.</p><p>I set something like:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>tc qdisc add dev eth0 root netem loss 10%</code></pre></div><p>but that configures loss to the router (192.168.1.1) only and not between my different computers.<br />It seems the communication is only going through the switch without passing the router.</p><p>Is it possible to set up some VLANs to get a behaviour as described above?<br />Something like this would be useful:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>tc qdisc add dev eth0.1 root netem loss 10%
tc qdisc add dev eth0.2 root netem loss 10%
tc qdisc add dev eth0.3 root netem loss 10%
tc qdisc add dev eth0.4 root netem loss 10%</code></pre></div><p>How do I create VLANs so that communication between those computers is still possible?</p>									</div>
