					<p>Has anyone already tried to compile Zfone ( <a href="http://www.philzimmermann.com/EN/zfone/zfone.html">http://www.philzimmermann.com/EN/zfone/zfone.html</a> ) for OpenWrt? The licence prohibits to distribute the source or binaries - but I think it still would make a piece of very useful software on a router (everyone who would want to use it would have to get the source and compile for himself).</p><p>Greetings,</p><p>Sav</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello Savek,</p><p>Well the idea is great, unfortunately this implementation is not opensource and therefore cannot be part of the official openwrt repository. As there are ietf drafts, I hope somebody interested in this software will write an opensource implementation, maybe you ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, strictly speaking it is open source, you can request the sources from Phil Zimmermann or jsut Google it. If you have them, you are free to compile them into your OpenWRT router. Furthermore, Makefiles are already included in the FreeSwitch package, see <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=19431&amp;p=2">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php â€¦ 31&amp;p=2</a> .</p>									</div>

					<p>AFAIK, libzrtp-v0.81.514 cross compiled out of the box on OpenWRT. There is an <a href="http://code.google.com/p/open-zrtp/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk">open-zrtp</a> with a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">GNU Lesser GPL</a>. However, it doesn&#039;t come with any GNU (or any) Makefile and/or configure.ac files.</p>									</div>
