					<p>I came across this Ubee wifi &amp; cabel modem combo.</p><p>I couldn&#039;t find anywhere that it supports openwrt or dd-wrt. Is it just this device, or is it possible to port OpenWRT to wifi/cable combos?</p><br /><p>I&#039;m not that experienced in electrical hardware. What I found:</p><p>There&#039;s a BCM 43224 abgn wifi mini-pcie card, rebranded as ubee (has fcc id XCNC2104001)</p><p>I found a chip on the main board &quot;Atheros AR8315-AH1E&quot;. Not sure what it is. Google shows results to chineese electronics suppliers.</p><p>It has a USB 2.0 port it seems.</p><p>When I boot it up, it gets stuck in a loop, trying to establish a cable connection (I didn&#039;t connect it to a coxical cable connection.)</p><p>I&#039;m gettinga usb-serial (TTL) adapter soon, so may try to probe for a UART connection to get serial output.</p><br /><p>edit: pics of board: imgur.com/a/R5kOk</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mushi</strong> on 14 Mar 2017, 17:14)</p>

					<p>Atheros chip is merely the Ethernet PHY/switch; notice it is connected to the Ethernet port transformers.&nbsp; The CPU / SoC will be under the big heatsink.&nbsp; The pin header near the cable port looks like it would be serial.&nbsp; </p><p>Very unlikely it can work with OpenWrt.</p>									</div>

I set flow control to None and was able to type, though characters show up as a gray box. I was able to select &#039;1&#039; to boot the first image. It was similar to image 2 though.
