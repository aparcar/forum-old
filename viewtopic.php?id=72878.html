					<p>Hello everybody<br />I recently got my hands on a brand new, sealed netgear router<br />The only problem is that I can&#039;t flash it to openwrt. I tried the GUI and it complains about incorrect firmware. I also tried tftp, but it doesn&#039;t seem to want to restart after sending the firmware.<br />As far as I understand, it was provided by Shaw in Canada. Is it possible to unlock it so it can be used with openwrt?<br />Thanks in advance!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gixie</strong> on 30 Dec 2017, 01:14)</p>
