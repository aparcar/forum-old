					<p>Hi,</p><p>Some time ago I purchased the ICIDU NI-707533 wireless router here in the Netherlands. Some Google-Fu taught me that it&#039;s a TP-LINK WR1043ND (v1), which should be supported by OpenWRT. Older ICIDU routers have succesfuly been flashed with TP-LINK firmware, which would allow me to upgrade to OpenWRT. Unfortunately, the protection mechanism of the TP-LINK router has been implemented, leading to this error message:</p><p>Error code: 18005</p><p>Upgrade unsuccessfully because the version of the upgraded file was incorrect.<br />Please check the file name.</p><p>Is there a way to find the correct naming scheme? ICIDU provides no downloads for my router except a manual (in Dutch)</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br />Theemuts</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Theemuts,</p><p>Could you tell how u tried to update the device? Only using a update-file within the webinterface will NOT work!<br />Normally you have to open the device and find a TTL (3,3V) serial connector (or JTAG) to &#039;break&#039; the default boot process.<br />Then you can use a tftp program to flash the new file onto the device.</p><p>Regards, DG.</p><p>PS, nice name <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi DGDodo, thanks for the reply!</p><p>I did try to use the web interface, because earlier models of ICIDU could be flashed with TP-LINK firmware from the web interface according to several sources. The model I own is basically a rebranded WR1043ND v1, which includes the simple protection that checks if the firmware filename is valid. It can be circumvented on a WR1043ND router by renaming the firmware you&#039;re trying to flash to the router to an actual filename used by TP-LINK for firmware upgrades, which I assume should work on my router as well. </p><p>At this point I&#039;m trying to flash the router with German TP-LINK firmware, which is required to upgrade a WR1043ND to OpenWRT, and I&#039;ve tried the most obvious substitutions without succes. Using JTAG sounds like an interesting project, I&#039;l certainly look into it. Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Theemuts,</p><p>I did the same kinda trick on a &#039;dead&#039; ZyXEL modem/router (<a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=47957">LINK</a>). Would be your challange to do it on the ICIDU?</p><p>Regards, DG.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>DGDodo</strong> on 14 May 2014, 22:49)</p>
