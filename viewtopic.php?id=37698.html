					<p>A few years back, I bought a Network Management Card (AP9630) for my APC Smart UPS 1000.&nbsp; I figured it would simplify managing the multiple computers I was running on the UPS.&nbsp; I was wrong.&nbsp; The APC software was horrible.&nbsp; The linux version required Java and a graphical interface, and that wasn&#039;t going to cut it on my headless Linux server.&nbsp; NUT looked like a possibility, and after running across <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=26269">this post</a>, I decided to give a shot at installing NUT on OpenWRT.&nbsp; After some effort, I now have NUT running on OpenWRT managing my UPS and serving my local network, and it does everything I had hoped that the expensive Network Management Card should have done.&nbsp; </p><p>By installing it on an OpenWRT router, you gain a few things over installing it on a linux server.&nbsp; The router boots up quickly, is on every hour of every day, and is a low power device.&nbsp; Power can be cut at any time without concern for corruption of the filesystem, and upon return of power, it will always boot back up to a running condition.</p><p>I found this so useful, that I thought I&#039;d share it with the OpenWRT community.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t be opposed to writing a wiki on it, I just don&#039;t have any experience in that.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if people would find that useful or not.&nbsp; </p><p>Here&#039;s what I did:</p><p><strong>Building the NUT Package</strong></p><p>The first thing I did was to build the NUT package.&nbsp; I am running Backfire 10.03.1 with the 2.4 kernel, on a WRT54GS.&nbsp; Prior to this, I had never built a package for OpenWRT.&nbsp; This is the part I have the least confidence in, so I won&#039;t go into detail.&nbsp; I started with the Makefile I found following the link in the post by OpenSys above.&nbsp; After some trouble compiling it, I eventually pared down the file to only include the apcsmart driver and a few other files.&nbsp; Here is the Makefile I used, including the commented out lines:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#
