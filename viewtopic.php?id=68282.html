					<p>Hey, I&#039;ve been working on the new linksys router and have been trying to move some of my QoS scripts from the 1900ACS router to the 3200ACM.&nbsp; The only issues are I cant run any scripts that require kmod-sched, kmod-sched-core, etc. because the current kernel version for the 3200ACM is 3.18.36 whereas the packages depend on kernel 3.18.23.&nbsp; </p><p>This may not be the sole issue, however, it seems to be the only apparent problem I&#039;ve picked up on.&nbsp; I was trying to figure out where to go from here, removing the packages then force installing them hasnt gotten me anywhere.&nbsp; I dont know how hard it would be to roll the kernel version back a release or something like that either. Please let me know if yall have any advice for this issue.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Is building the kmod packages reasonable?&nbsp; As in does that just mean I need to modify the dependencies in the current kmod packages or would you know if I need to rewrite a good amount of stuff and build a flashable openwrt image for said packages.&nbsp; Thanks for clarifying by the way, and it seems to only be the kmod packages that are out of date the rest seem fine.</p><p>Thanks again</p>									</div>
