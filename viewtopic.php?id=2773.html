					<p>Hello Guys,</p><p>i bought a asus wl500g, after 2 days, port1 wasn&#039;t longer functional. But you know, that&#039;s the flashing port. So, i decide to use my guarantee and get a new one. What will i have to do, to get the current status of my firmware to the new router and what will i have to do, to flash a original firmware to the broken router?</p><p>thanks a lot</p><p>daemonb</p>									</div>
