					<p>Hi<br />I&#039;m a bit confused because there are 2 different (though similar) models being discussed.</p><p> - The first link provided (for MR3020) says that mtd is an OK way to revert to factory firmware.<br /> - But the MR3040 wiki page doesn&#039;t list mtd as an option - only says serial console for restoring factory.</p><br /><p>So:</p><p> - Is mtd a valid way to go on the MR3040 v2.1?<br /> - If mtd fails, should the serial console still work?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; -- [If so, then I&#039;m willing to test, so I otherwise need to get to a serial console eventually anyway</p><br /><p>Thanks!</p><p>Adam</p>									</div>

					<p>I was able to use mtd to load dd-wrt, and was able to go back to OpenWrt from dd-wrt via the same method (but they call the destination partition &quot;linux&quot;)</p><p>BUT, I cannot load the stock firmware [mr3040v2_en_3_14_4_up_boot(121017).bin] via mtd.&nbsp; When I try to do it from OpenWrt I get &quot;Failed to erase block&quot;, and when I try to do it from dd-wrt I get &quot;Erasing mtd failed: linux&quot;.&nbsp; If I just do &quot;mtd erase&quot; then it works... </p><p>In these cases of failures, I don&#039;t get kicked out of SSH, so I&#039;m able to get back to relative safety by re-loading OpenWrt</p><br /><p>One thing I notice is that the OpenWrt and DD-WRT .bin&#039;s are exactly the same size (3,932,160 bytes) but the tp-link stock firmware is bigger (4,063,744 bytes).&nbsp; The difference is 131,584 bytes which == 128.5KB.</p><p>When I read the mr3020 wiki which warns about only the older firmware file working, I see:<br /> - The older file that works is the same size as the dd-wrt/openwrt files I mentioned above,<br /> - The newer one that doesn&#039;t work on mr3020 is the same size as the larger mr3040, and has &quot;boot&quot; in the filename</p><p>I could have sworn I read somewhere to make sure your firmware did have &quot;boot&quot; in the filename, but now I can&#039;t find that reference.</p><p>Going to poke around with a hex editor and see if there&#039;s anything obvious occupying exactly 131,584 bytes in the &quot;boot&quot; files.</p>									</div>

					<p>SUCCESS.</p><p>after some analysis with a hex editor, it becomes quite obvious that the .bin&#039;s which are 131,584 bytes larger have an extra* 131,584 bytes at the BEGINNING.&nbsp; I chopped off those beginning bytes from mr3040v2_en_3_14_4_up_boot(121017).bin with a hex editor and was able to flash back to the stock firmware using mtd!</p><br /><p>I repeat: mr3040 v2.1 flashed back to stock firmware with mtd - no need for serial console, just need to modify the .bin.&nbsp; &nbsp;(This presumes you haven&#039;t already bricked your device - you need SSH access at minimum here)</p><br /><p>I just deleted everything before 0x20200, which is easy to find because there&#039;s a large section of zero&#039;s right before the first byte you keep which is 0x01 followed shortly by &quot;TP-LINK&quot;.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a clever way to chop off those bytes using DD, but I didn&#039;t bother.</p><br /><p>Hope this is helpful to somebody else.&nbsp; I&#039;ll try to update the relevant wikis too.</p><br /><p>Adam</p><p>[*This extra bit says &quot;U-boot&quot; 3 times in it, and since the filename also says &quot;boot&quot;, I guess it&#039;s a safe bet that those files include an update to the bootloader.&nbsp; &nbsp;would be great if that new U-boot had a &quot;boot wait&quot; tftp in it...]</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>aberson</strong> on 28 Sep 2013, 04:29)</p>

					<p>Ah so you are correct.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s smart to write it centrally, but also must at least be linked from each router&#039;s wiki page, because I never came across the tp-link start page in my searches - I got right to the mr3040 page via google.&nbsp; But I&#039;m new around here...</p><br /><p>Here&#039;s how I&#039;d write it:</p><br /><p>The router&#039;s firmware must be 3,932,160 bytes to flash via mtd.&nbsp; If you download firmware from tp-link which is 4,063,744 bytes then this 128.5KB larger firmware also has the boot firmware in it (usually says &quot;boot&quot; in the filename).&nbsp; Historically this has been located at the beginning of the file*, but theoretically that could change.&nbsp; (*You can confirm this by opening in a hex editor and scrolling down to address 0x20200.&nbsp; Just prior to that location you should see a large block of 00&#039;s.&nbsp; At 0x20200 you should have a &quot;01&quot; followed by a few 00&#039;s and then &quot;TP-LINK&quot;)</p><br /><p>The first 128.5KB can be removed with this command (after getting the firmware into /tmp via scp or wget):&nbsp; &quot;dd if=original_filename.bin of=modified_filename.bin skip=257 bs=512&quot;.&nbsp; Following this, the file is the correct size (3,932,160 bytes) and can be flashed with &quot;mtd -r write /tmp/filename.bin firmware&quot;.</p><p>When flashing with mtd, if you receive an error such as &quot;failed to erase block&quot;, then DO NOT REBOOT your router.&nbsp; Instead, flash a known good firmware of the proper size (e.g. flash the sysupgrade bin for the OpenWrt version you most recently had)</p>									</div>
