					<p>Hi,</p><p>I don&#039;t want to resurrect this topic, but I would like to know if we still have to recompile Barrier&nbsp; Breaker, now that it has been officially released, to have USB host support in 740n/741nd v 2.x? I don&#039;t mind doing that, but that usually means I have to do my own builds of packages that I need and I would really prefer just to get what I need from the official repos. My main problem is the incompatibility with my kernel build and the official one, hence some kmod I would need later, would mean another rebuild for me.
