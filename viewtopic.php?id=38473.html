					<p>Hi,<br /> There is my my first attempt at using OpenWrt and I have hit a problem.&nbsp; My setup is as follows:<br />TP Link TL-WR2543ND router<br />Virgin Media Ambit 256 cable modem</p><p>I have:<br />*Flashed the openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr2543n-v1-squashfs-factory.bin firmware on to the router<br />*changed the password via telnet<br />*Changed my computers network connection to ip address: 192.168.1.2 subnet 255.255.255.0<br />The routers IP address is 192.168.1.1</p><p>I can ping 192.168.1.1 and ssh into 192.168.1.1 using putty but <a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a> is not displaying a web UI so I assume the firmware doesn&#039;t include one?</p><p>I have tried running opkg update from putty but it says it cant find the download address.</p><p>I have tried a couple changing a couple of configuration options usins UCI e.g. setting the mac address of the wan to the mac address of the cable modem but I still cant get on the internet.</p><p>I have been pulling my hair out over his for the last 5 hours, so any help would be appreciated. Any ideas what I should try next? Is there any diagnostic information that I could post that would help?</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p><p>Nigel</p>									</div>

					<p>I have eventually managed to get the internet connection working, so for the benefit of any one else with the same setup:</p><p>The IP address of the ambit 256 modem is 192.168.100.1 so I set the lan address of the router to 192.168.100.2 via telnet</p><p>uci.set network.lan.ipaddr=&quot;192.168.100.2&quot;<br />uci commit network<br />sync &amp;&amp; reboot</p><p>and rebooted the modem.</p><p>I read somewhere that it can take several reboots of both the router and the modem for the router to be able to pickup a wan address so it may just be that it had nothing to do with the IP address change.</p><p>To install the LUCI web interface telnet into the router then run the following commands:<br />opkg update<br />opkg install luci-ssl<br />/etc/init.d/uhttpd enable<br />/etc/init.d/uhttpd start</p><p>Misc<br />------<br />If you want to see your config from telnet run: uci show<br />To do a factory reset of openwrt on the device power cycle it and immediately start pressing the other button (not power) on and off</p>									</div>
