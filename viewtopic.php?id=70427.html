					<p>Hello,<br />I have a Linksys WRT1900AC with ChaosCalmer and an ethernet to SFP module connected to the WAN port of the router. This module is recommended by my ISP and confirmed to work by other user with various router but they don&#039;t provide the support to configure the router with OpenWRT (they guys at helpdesk is lost when I tell what options I have).</p><p>I have a current a router/modem ZyXel that work on this connection with the following configuration:</p><p>Mode: Routing<br />WANServiceType: IP over Ethernet<br />IPv6/4 mode: IPv4 only<br />VLAN<br />Enable VLAN: YES<br />Enter 802.1P Priority: 7 (but it works with any number I think)<br />Enter 802.1Q VLAN ID: 10<br />MTU: 1460<br />Obtain an IP address automatically: YES<br />Enable DHCP option 60: NO</p><p>Routing feature<br />NAT Enable: YES<br />Adress Mapping Enable: NO<br />IGMP Proxy Enable: NO<br />Apply as Default Gateway: YES</p><p>DNS<br />Obtain DNS info automatically: YES</p><p>6 to 4 tunneling: NO</p><p>How can I replicate this configuration in OpenWRT ? </p><p>It&#039;s the part where I have to enter VLAN ID = 10 that I&#039;m not sure how to configure but I&#039;m not even sure that the rest is correct to begin with. I have found a topic that seams to talk about a similar configuration but when I replicate what was explain it doesn&#039;t work and I have no ideas what is correct or not and what is not working exactly, the topic is this one: id=68206 (sorry no link allowed)</p>									</div>

					<p>This will be a little different depending on which hardware version you have.&nbsp; </p><p>Go to the switch configuration (Network --&gt; Switch page) and change the VLAN number associated with the WAN port from 0 or 1 to number 10.&nbsp; Change it from untagged to tagged on the physical port that goes to the modem cable (seems to always be port 4).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 31 Mar 2017, 14:44)</p>

					<p>Hi all,<br />sorry for reviving an old post.<br />First of all, thanks for all the informations you already provided in this thread.</p><p>I&#039;m going to move from an fttc connection to an ftth one, and i would like to keep my openwrt 1900acs on top of the chain.<br />Could you please provide me an example of the &quot;ethernet to SFP module connected to the WAN port of the router&quot; you used to make this work? Something like the tp-link FBA_MC210CS <a href="https://www.google.it/search?q=FBA_MC210CS&amp;rlz=1C1AVFC_enIT753IT753&amp;oq=FBA_MC210CS&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60.1175j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">https://www.google.it/search?q=FBA_MC21 â€¦ p;ie=UTF-8</a>??<br />I wish my isp&#039;s configuration will allow me to do the same as you did. <br />I think i&#039;ll need to clone the original router&#039;s mac address and find the vlanid for the wan interface<br />Thanks again,<br />K.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>eluc wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Hello,<br />I have a Linksys WRT1900AC with ChaosCalmer and an ethernet to SFP module connected to the WAN port of the router.</p></blockquote></div>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>komodo_1</strong> on 25 Mar 2018, 14:54)</p>
