					<p>Okay, so this is a bit of a mess. This is what my network looks like:</p><p>ISP Router (192.168.0.1) —&gt; Main Router (10.16.99.1) —&gt;&nbsp; AP (10.16.99.3) with [Guest Network (10.23.25.1)]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>So I&#039;m trying to add this AP that has OpenWRT onto a relative&#039;s network using the LAN port, I&#039;ve got the main wifi network with DHCP off and it works fine. On the guest network by following a couple of guides, devices get their own ip address and can see my local network (will change firewall after testing) including my main router but cannot get onto the internet. I guess this is because those devices cannot reach 192.168.0.1 (ISP Router)? </p><p>I know I should be using VLANs and such but I cannot get openWRT on my main router at this time and the ISP router doesn&#039;t have a modem mode.</p><p>Any help?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Adeel567</strong> on 29 Jul 2017, 04:04)</p>

					<p>You should start by including your config files.<br />The above looks like the Guest AP is on your main router, but I think it is really on 10.16.99.3.&nbsp; </p><p>The OpenWrt wiki for Guest AP assumes the AP on the Main router, but there is minimal discussion about using VLAN to move it to an AP as the AP&#039;s guest gets it DHCP from the main router.&nbsp; &nbsp; I am instead using this &quot;recipie&quot; for running the guest AP and DHCP on the guest.<br /><a href="https://blog.doenselmann.com/gaeste-wlan-auf-openwrt-access-point/">https://blog.doenselmann.com/gaeste-wla … ess-point/</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, looks like formatting got messed up when i copy and pasted. </p><p>I used that guide but i could not get internet access, if i follow it until the blocking of LAN devices I can successfully see my main router but cannot reach the internet. </p><p>I&#039;ll figure out how to copy the config files and copy them in tomorrow.</p><p>Am I missing something or not following the guide correctly, or is it because I have my ISP router causing trouble?<br />Because I cannot ping the ISP router on the guest network, I&#039;m guessing that&#039;s the main culprit.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Adeel567</strong> on 29 Jul 2017, 04:07)</p>
