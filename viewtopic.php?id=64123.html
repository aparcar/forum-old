					<p>I want to plug my desktop to a router running OpenWRT, and have OpenWRT keep a list all domains and IP addresses that the desktop attempts to connect. I want to let this set up run for days, and grab the list somehow (download is better but copy-paste is fine too). Duplicates are not a problem, I can filter them out later.</p><p>Here is an example of a list that I expect to get</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>2a00:1450:400d:806::200e
216.58.209.17
alt2.aspmx.l.google.com
1e100.net
193.92.133.2</code></pre></div><p>Is this possible with OpenWRT?</p><p>And if yes, can this be done via the web interface?</p><p>Some background follows, for those interested.</p><p>I want to transition to Windows 10 but also want to avoid the telemetry stuff.</p><p>So I first plan to get a list of all the domains and IPs that W10 tries to connect to, and then block it. I have found that list online, as other people have done the same, but I would like to do this myself.</p><p>The next step is tell OpenWRT to block that list. But that belongs to a later question.</p>									</div>

					<p>A solution where I don&#039;t have to mess with networking would be wonderful! I have stumbled upon this article and plan to test what it says inside a VM (connect a Windows 10 VM with a pfSense VM and cache all domains and IPs).</p><p>However, the little paranoid inside me tells me I should probably try this on the bare metal, just in case W10 can detect it runs inside a VM.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>swapjim</strong> on 12 Apr 2016, 02:48)</p>

					<p>Hahahah! Thanks!</p><p>I&#039;ve posted this topic ton the DD-WRT forums too, and the responses were similar.</p><p>To do the task I want, I&#039;ve been thinking of grabbing a 50USD WRT54GL and install one of the open firmwares in it, but it&#039;s such a challenge that a 300USD pfSense/IPfire appliance looks veeeeery appealing right now. I know that pfSense does everything I want because I tested the setup in VMs.</p><p>Thanks again.</p>									</div>
