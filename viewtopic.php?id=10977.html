					<p>Hey,</p><p>I just got a &#039;so called&#039; defective device in my hands: A Sinus 154 Basic 3 router from the &#039;Deutsche Telekom&#039;.</p><p>After fixing the powersupply it booted up and reacted with a telnet login and a webserver which only says it is running.</p><p>Looking around on the shell shows me, there are no wireless tools, nor anything else useful. Even the whole filesystem is readonly.</p><p>Is there another, a little bit more functional openwrt firmware which I could flash on this device? Wlan would be nice... Or do I have to patch and compile the<br />latest ar7 trunk on my own to get an image which does more than opens a telnet-port?</p><p>Thanks a lot in advance!</p><p>BTW: How could I flash the firmware with&nbsp; &#039;mtd&#039;? Do I have to set a starting address or something like that?</p><p>cheers,</p><p>prefect</p>									</div>
