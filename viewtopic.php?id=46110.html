					<p>Make sure xt_time is installed, its in iptables-mod-extra afair.<br />Also to block a range use &quot;option src_ip 192.168.1.50-192.168.1.59&quot; the uci firewall will map that to the appropriate iprange match.

					<p>due to the fact that most streaming and social media sites have multiple ip addresses, it is hard to block them by simple rules.<br />Of course if you want to disable all internet access on sepcific ip&#039;s you can simply reject the forwarding traffic from that ip</p><p>but if you want to limmit site access, it is recommended to use a proxy. to filter out the domain names. Simply because you can&#039;t predict the ip address it is going to connect to in a lot of cases. and a transparent proxy with iptables REDIRECT or TPROXY with privoxy is a nice solution. Especially because the kids then can still browse the internet for homework stuff.<br />(REDIRECT is the easier one of the two).</p><p>and with privoxy you can go as far as setting up a cron (scheduled) task, to load rulesets on a specific time of the day.<br />(of course it would also be possible to do that with iptables as well, if you only want to reject internet at some time in the day).</p><p>If you want the solution with privoxy, i can chew up something you can easilly use. (because I use a simillar setup, not for blocking traffic thoug. but to modify the request headers to stream the bbc while not in the uk).</p>									</div>

I can write a rule in /etc/config/firewall by doing this:</p><p>config rule<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option src &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option dest &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option name &#039;Host Block&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option src_ip &#039;XX.XX.XX.XX&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option target &#039;REJECT&#039;</p><p>... and that works just fine, but my question is - how can I block a range of IP address instead of writing a separate rule for each IP.</p><p>If some one can help to write it out the config rule correctly (syntax&#039;s wise) i would really appreciate it. Guys... please help... </p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>

I&#039;m not very well familiar how to write and expression in binary mode for the range of the IP address.<br />Could you please be so kind to give example how to write out the binary expression for the range from 10.0.4.240 to 10.0.4.249. </p><p>So, the total number of the addresses with in the range is 10. </p><p>Thank you so much for your help.</p>									</div>
