					<p>Hey there everyone,</p><p>First off, I would like to say I have been browsing these (and other) forums for days and have found nothing thus far that explains my issue.</p><p>I was recently sent a linksys wrt54g v2 wireless router from a guy I&#039;ve done some work for. After repeatedly trying to get it up and running, I finally found that someone at his office at one time was using it as a firewall, and had installed openwrt (white russian). </p><p>Now for one, I had never even heard of this software, so I began searching everywhere for a solution and no one seems to know thus far.</p><p>I&#039;ve downloaded the firmware for this router at the linksys website, along with the tftp client, still not working. I can&#039;t even get into to the openwrt interface, as no one knows the username or pass. I should note that my main workstation is running vista, but I do have access to an xp notebook which is not currently online (not sure if that would be an easier way to go).</p><p>From what I&#039;ve read it sounds as though this software could be very beneficial, but I simply need to get this router back to factory default so I can make my house wireless (everyone is going nuts here...hehe).</p><p>Again, I&#039;ve read through and tried everything I&#039;ve come across so far, but nothing has worked for me. If someone could help me out with this, it would be much appreciated (please keep in mind, I am noobish at a lot of this as I didn&#039;t even know you could do such a thing with a router).</p><p>Thanks advance for any help everyone.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>-Ditch</p>									</div>

					<p>The easiest way to restor the device back to factory, I would think is the TFTP method.</p><p>Using the XP machine may make this easier.</p><p>The timing can be a bit tricky, and you may have to attempt it a few times.</p><p>First thing you need to do is find out the network address of the router,&nbsp; (lets just say it is 192.168.1.1)</p><p>you need to set a static IP on your windows machine so it would exist on the same network as the router.&nbsp; (lets say 192.168.1.5 with a netmask of 255.255.255.0)</p><p>make sure your XP system is plugged directly into one of the LAN ports on the linksys.</p><p>open a command prompt.</p><p>[start menu]<br />[run]<br />run: cmd</p><p>at the prompt type </p><p>tftp -i 192.168.1.1 PUT &lt;FULL PATH TO FILENAME.bin&gt;<br />DON&#039;T HIT ENTER YET!</p><p>should look something like this.<br />C:\&gt;tftp -i 192.168.1.1 PUT C:\WRT54GV4.0_4.21.1_US_code.bin</p><p>now power cycle the router (unplug the power)</p><p>plug in the power and then hit enter, as soon as you see the power light.</p><p>first time I attempted this, it took me several tries.</p><p>you want to play with the timing of when you hit enter.</p><p>if the guy who installed it on the router in the first place left boot wait turned on, you will have a much easier time, if it is turned off.&nbsp; your window drastically shortens.<br />unfortunately without the login to the router, you can&#039;t exactly tell.</p><p>First time I attempted to flash the firmware this way, I had a v3 with bootwait turned on, (linksys default) installed Openwrt on the router. </p><p>It took me almost half an hour to get it uploaded.</p><p>the timing is critical.</p><br /><p>Good luck!</p>									</div>

					<p>This is valid for other routers as well? I&#039;m using Ubiquiti bullets and I want to know if this procedure is right for my equipment.<br />Thanks</p>									</div>
