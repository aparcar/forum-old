					<p>Hi,<br />I have made a wiki page and a benchmark script to compare performance of hardware of different devices running OpenWRT.<br />It&#039;s here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/HardwarePerformance">http://wiki.openwrt.org/HardwarePerformance</a></p><p>I have an ASUS WL-500g, could others that have a different device (Linksys, NSLU) also run the bench and update the page?

					<p>Thanks for your comments guys.<br />The point is that I don&#039;t ask you to give reason why I shouldn&#039;t have done that CPU test. I asked to test your device and report your results!<br />The point is that there *are* differences between devices, especially between WL-500g and Linksys NSLU. That&#039;s what intersts me most. And I don&#039;t know for WRT54g</p><p>For samba file sharing, I have a low IO rate because (I think) the CPU is not that powerful... And the same for SFTP since encryption is heavy on resources.<br />That&#039;s the whole point of the test!</p><p>And I agree that compiler can change CPU bench a lot. But the point is not to glorify your results but to compare them. Just to be able to buy what&#039;s best for CPU &quot;intensive&quot; applications (read SSH and samba)</p><p>Another point is that if you want to do Donkey p2p (amule, mldonkey) you need a *fast* CPU. Also RAM is needed.</p><p>That said, I agree that having made a C++ application (instead of plain C) isnot a good idea... I&#039;ll change that and re-upload.</p><p>Thanks for reading.<br />-jec</p>									</div>

					<p>just a small note to your wiki-page: either you have a wl-500g and a 125mhz cpu or a wl-500g deluxe and a 200mhz cpu - i think you need to correct that!</p><p>also, why don&#039;t you make a package out of your cpu-test or upload the binary somewhere? i wouldn&#039;t want to fetch the whole sdk just to compile the cpu-test!</p><p>greetings, <br />andy</p>									</div>

					<p>I find cpu benchmarks rather amusing.
