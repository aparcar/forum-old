Those changes in hardware aren&#039;t supposed to make any difference in performance or reliability, however, the stories we hear where there&#039;s a one-off or perhaps a few people, who are experiencing a problem, that no one else has, tends to indicate those &quot;other parts&quot; may be the difference. </p><p>It&#039;s just a on going idea based on those &quot;gremlins&quot; that seem to affect just a few, but not the whole.</p></blockquote></div><p>Welllll - I&#039;m now guessing I didn&#039;t run into the issue David describes here, but I&#039;ll describe what happened to me just in case it&#039;s helpful for someone else.</p><p>I flashed my ACS with davidc502&#039;s shelby FW (with the .17 wifi driver) for the first time.

However, when I applied new wifi settings (changed ssid, added security, etc.) and enabled the radios, they didn&#039;t turn on. After clicking &quot;Enable&quot; the text below &quot;Generic...&quot; stated &quot;disabled&quot; and the controller was &quot;disconnected&quot; or &quot;unable to connect&quot;.
