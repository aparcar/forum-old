					<p>I think stock OS performs some checks if the image is compatible with its hardware. Make sure that you&#039;re loading an appropriate image ( there could be multiple versions of the same model). Most of the stock&#039;s UI have a checkbox&nbsp; like &#039;don&#039;t check&#039; image. Uncheck it at your own risk and try to upload again. If all of those fails you might try to look forward to <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/netboot">bootp</a> vmlinux or try luck via <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/port.serial">uart</a></p>									</div>

					<p>If anyone wants to know about my findings:</p><p>The login over telnetenable is nearly as good as the login over ssh. You can do quite many things, if you put busybox into your temp folder you can even use dd to backup the partitions before doing anything else.</p><p>When you are uploading a new firmware to the router there are some basic checks done with javascripts. Afterwards it is sent to check_upgrade.cgi which will then check the firmware itself. I haven&#039;t been able to find the check_upgrade.cgi anywhere on the system using telnet, but modifying the script would maybe help to flash OpenWRT without soldering the serial port.</p>									</div>

					<p>2-3 years ago I bought a DGND3800B cause at that time I had a problem with my VDSL Modem and I could not get a proper replacement.I only used it for some days later I brought back my original equipment. </p><p>These days I need a more powerfull openwrt based router and I remembered that DGND3800B. It&#039;s original Firmware was 3.0.0.10_3.0.10.</p><p>To make it short: No way to flash it with any OpenWrt Release. </p><p>I systematically tried all available Netgear FW from 3.0.0.10_3.0.10. up to V3.0.0.22_3.1.22. With every version I installed the following OpenWRT/LEDE FW:</p><p>- openwrt-DGND3800B-squashfs-factory.chk (V14.07)<br />- openwrt-15.05-brcm63xx-smp-DGND3800B-squashfs-factory.chk (V15.05)<br />- lede-17.01.4-brcm63xx-smp-DGND3800B-squashfs-factory.chk (V17.01.4)</p><p>The result is always the same, after a few seconds the Webif sends:</p><p>&quot;Firmware upgrade failed. Please check your file.&quot;</p><p>That is the same error I receive if I try to install a firmware before 3.0.0.10_3.0.10 eg. DGND3800B-V3.0.0.8_3.0.8.chk </p><p>In the &quot;Release Note for DGND3800B-V3.0.0.10_3.0.10.html&quot; of Netgear 3.0.0.10_3.0.10 FW one can read as new feature:</p><p>&quot;Adds check mechanism to prevent the board with new flash downgrade old firmware&quot;</p><p>So I think thats the reason for all this problems here. </p><p>I saw the picture of the user @danitool here which is showing a downgrade on top of Netgears 3.0.16, I have no explanation why it&#039;s working on his router. But with mine I can&#039;t reproduce that.</p><p>Unfortuantely I&#039;m not familar with the inner life of OpenWRT/LEDE FW so my silly question: Wouldn&#039;t it be possible to change the header of the Openwrt/LEDE firmware, so that it is anouncing itself as an realease &gt; V3.0.0.22_3.1.22.</p>									</div>
