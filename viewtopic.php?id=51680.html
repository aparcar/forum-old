					<p>I came across a Luxul XAP-1020 and discovered it runs MIPS OpenWrt Linux-3.3.8.&nbsp; So I booted the device into failsafe mode, telneted into 192.168.1.1 changed the root password, and now I have access to ssh.&nbsp; According to the opkg.conf file it runs attitude adjustment 12.09-rc1/ar71xx/generic. Packages will not install.&nbsp; They complain missing dependencies.&nbsp; </p><p>Just thought I&#039;d share in case anyone else had one too.<br />The chip is an Atheros 7240-atha, 127009-1b</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gfem</strong> on 17 Jul 2014, 18:31)</p>
