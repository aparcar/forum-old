					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>I have a Netgear WNDR3700 sitting behind a Motorola NVG510 gateway from AT&amp;T (U-verse). For some inscrutable reason, this RG doesn&#039;t have a bridge mode setting, but I&#039;m able to pass its IP and traffic to the router, which achieves a similar effect. However, under the stock firmware (1.0.16.98, the latest available), this setup gives me some performance issues, so I thought I&#039;d try some third-party firmware. I installed arokh&#039;s r29617 build of OpenWRT yesterday, and after initial configuration everything seems to be working quite well.</p><p>...All except the PPTP connection to my work VPN. This worked fine under the Netgear firmware, where I could (essentially) put my home workstation in DMZ, but I don&#039;t see any similar option in LuCI. My computer can connect to the server but then I get a &quot;timeout sending Config-Requests&quot; error. In search of a solution, I&#039;ve gone through the relevant Wiki entries and a number of forum posts, but in the end they&#039;ve only confused me. Perhaps you fine folks can help clear the air around this topic.</p><p>I&#039;ve been hoping for a port forwarding or &quot;PPTP passthrough&quot; solution, but I&#039;d settle for putting my workstation in a &quot;DMZ&quot; like it was before. Is there something simple I can add to /etc/firewall.user or /etc/config/network to accomplish this? Can anybody coach me through the process of making such a change? For my sake and the sake of those who might have the same question later, please assume - and forgive - total inexperience. Thanks!</p>									</div>

After making the changes I&#039;ve tried restarting the router and simply restarting the firewall via LuCI, to make sure the rules were recognized and applied. Even putting the &quot;Simple DMZ&quot; rule (with my own IP address, of course) into /etc/config/firewall doesn&#039;t seem to work for me... but perhaps I&#039;m doing something wrong. Have you gotten this to work yourself? Can you, or someone else, walk me through the setup in more detail? I&#039;d be much obliged.</p>									</div>

					<p>I appreciate your help, fyi, but I don&#039;t think I follow. To be sure we&#039;re on the same page, I&#039;ll post more details about what I&#039;ve already tried.</p><p>Per the Black Manticore article, I put the following code into firewall.user, with no success. (192.168.2.200 is my computer&#039;s static IP.)<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># PPTP: forward initiator 1723/tcp
iptables -t nat -A prerouting_wan -p tcp --dport 1723 -j DNAT --to 192.168.2.200
iptables -A forwarding_wan -p tcp --dport 1723 -d 192.168.2.200 -j ACCEPT

# PPTP: forward tunnel GRE traffic
iptables -t nat -A prerouting_wan -p gre -j DNAT --to 192.168.2.200
iptables -A forwarding_wan -p gre -d 192.168.2.200 -j ACCEPT</code></pre></div><p>Per another discussion in this forum, I tried this alternate approach, with no better results:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -A input_wan -p tcp --dport 1723 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A input_wan -p gre -j ACCEPT

iptables -A input_rule -i ppp+ -j ACCEPT
iptables -A forwarding_rule -i ppp+ -j ACCEPT
iptables -A forwarding_rule -o ppp+ -j ACCEPT
iptables -A output_rule -o ppp+ -j ACCEPT</code></pre></div><p>I had also already tried putting the following at the end of /etc/config/firewall. No joy.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;redirect&#039;
    option &#039;src&#039; &#039;wan&#039;
    option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;all&#039;
    option &#039;dest_ip&#039; &#039;192.168.2.200&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Am I doing something wrong here, or is there some other code that would do the trick? With my background as a web developer, I understand enough to have some idea of what the code is ostensibly doing, but not enough to be sure it&#039;s right.</p>									</div>
