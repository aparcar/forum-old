					<p>I&#039;ve been selling an OpenWrt-capable device called the Bifferboard since January.&nbsp; Your &#039;dev-kit&#039; would involve purchasing the board (choose single or dual-USB version), a PSU and the &#039;console&#039; cable, which is just a USB-serial converter with the right connector on the end.&nbsp; There is no soldering or warranty invalidation required if you want to &#039;hack&#039; the device, since it&#039;s supplied with pin-headers already fitted.&nbsp; We also sell JTAG software for you to restore the bootloader, but not many need that.</p><p>Note:&nbsp; As supplied this is not a router, since it only has a single NIC, but you can add a USB nic if needed.</p><p>See <a href="http://www.bifferos.com">http://www.bifferos.com</a> and follow the &#039;buy&#039; link if interested.</p><p>regards,<br />Biff.</p>									</div>

					<p>Depends what/how much you want to do with it. </p><p>The Routerstation Pro really is a good choice for playing around; it has a fast CPU, plenty of RAM, nice amount of flash and a SD card slot, USB, several GPIOs, JTAG, a DB9 connector (although IIRC you do not need a null modem cable, but a non crossed cable - null modem won&#039;t work), gigabit ethernet, a powerful switch chip for experimenting with VLANs.</p><p>Plenty of RAM is especially nice since it allows you to tftp boot larger ramdisk images, for e.g. quick testing stuff.</p><p>What it doesn&#039;t have is WLAN, an enclosure, or a power brick - you have to buy these separate (WLAN is optional). Also, the support by Ubiquiti isn&#039;t the best (Better don&#039;t expect any from them). But there&#039;s of course the Openwrt community.</p><p>If you just want to tests some builds without extensive setups, the Bifferboard is the cheaper solution.

To access/connect this serial-console port (3.3V) from a computer, one usually uses a USB/Serial data cable from any cellphone. The most common one is the nokia DKU-5 USB/Serial data cable.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>I am just wondering if I can find a development board (that has all the needed component such as RS232 port) for coding and testing the OpenWRT code?</p></blockquote></div><p>As suggested above, I believe a <a href="http://www.ubnt.com/rspro">RouterStation Pro</a> board (US$79 sans WiFi, PSU, and enclosure) is what you are looking for. You will probably end up spending US$100+ to get everything to work with OpenWRT.</p><p>For me, a <a href="http://www.seagate.com/www/en-us/products/network_storage/freeagent_dockstar/">Seagate DockStar</a> (US$39.99 as a whole with PSU) that is now <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/seagate/dockstar">supported</a> under OpenWRT is more than sufficient to develop applications for OpenWRT. Unlike a RouterStation Pro board, this device is based on an ARM chipset clocked @1.2GHz with 128/256MB RAM/NAND (Flash), 1x mini USB2 + 3x regular USB2 ports, and 1x 10/100/1000 RJ45 port. One can connect a USB IP / WiFi / 3G modem dongle to one of its USB ports to turn this device into a NAT/Firewall (3G) WiFi router. If you choose to go with this device, perhaps the posts on <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=25603">HOWTO: install OpenWrt on Seagate Dockstar</a> and <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=26085">Adding Seagate Dockstar to Kirkwood</a> may be of interest for you to read. If you want to turn this device into an inexpensive PBX system, perhaps posts on this <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r24479163-Other-Own-a-FreeSwitch-on-a-Seagate-DockStar-for-2499">Own a FreeSwitch on a Seagate DockStar for $24.99</a> may help. BTW, if you lurk around, you may even be able to get this device for as little as US$24.99 or even under US$20. Nah, that is an offer one just can&#039;t resist! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>
