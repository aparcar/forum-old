					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I have two 3G connections as my primary internet connection at home. I figured it was a waste to just have one of them active and another one just laying around, so I set it up too.</p><p>Now, they both work, but I just wanted to ask for some, perhpas, more optimal usage.</p><p>When the router boots, both of the connections goes up as they should, but if the one that is set latest goes down first, the internet goes down completely, although the other connection is still up.<br />1. How would you guys set up the &quot;default gateway&quot; option?</p><p>I have a VPN that I still would like to use. The thing is that it does connect, but if one of connections goes down, like above, I&#039;d like the other one to become active as primary and connect to the VPN.<br />2. How would I do that?</p><p>3. Is there another, better way of combining multiple 3G connections and still be able to use the VPN?</p><p>Cheers!</p>									</div>

					<p>Try using the multiwan package to manage both of your links. The logic in multiwan should handle the gateways between the two modems and allow for a more robust backup/failover behavior.</p><br /><p>What kind of VPN are you running? OpenVPN? PPTP/L2TP? IPSec?<br />When I had a dual WAN setup and an IPSec VPN, I had to write a little hotplug script to restart the IPSec tunnel whenever the links changed from primary to backup, or backup to primary. I&#039;m sure there are better ways to handle a VPN with a dynamic IP (road-warrior setup) but for me this was the easiest and most reliable solution with the least amount of work <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>aport</strong> on 21 Nov 2012, 20:41)</p>
