					<p>Hey guys,</p><p>I tried to generate an image from trunk, because I&#039;d like to use the igmp snooping function integrated in later kernels. But as soon as I upload a trunk image, I cannot reach the device anymore. That&#039;s valid for self-built images as well as the trunk snapshot from download.openwrt.org . The device boots, the leds are on, they also show network traffic (if there is), but I just can&#039;t ping it or see any packages of it.<br />My backfire image works fine though. Does anybody have an idea how I can get it working, what could be the problem or how I can debug the problem?</p><p>Best regards</p>									</div>

					<p>What is your hardware version?&nbsp; Did you do a straight firmware load or a sysupgrade?&nbsp; Have you soldered on a header for a serial port?</p><p>I&#039;ve got 2 DIR-8251 (vB1) on the bench right now running trunk from a couple days ago.&nbsp; They are working perfectly.</p><p>-Brian</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the response! Seems very strange...<br />I&#039;ve got the B1 revision. I uploaded the images via the backup loader (I think the first one via sysupgrade, then I had to use the backup loader to try several different images until I switched back to backfire).<br />I did not modify the hardware in any way.</p>									</div>

					<p>Just to make sure I understand the process you used:</p><p>1) Download a trunk snapshot containing &quot;squashfs-factory&quot; in the name.<br />-----&nbsp; ie: openwrt-ar71xx-generic-dir-825-b1-squashfs-factory.bin</p><p>2) Follow the loading steps (I used a Win7 machine and the firmware recovery mode) from the wiki.</p><p>3) Telnet-passwd-reboot</p><p>4) Use the sysupgrade procedure from the wiki.</p><p>5) opkg update / opkg install and required for the features/functions you want.</p><p>That is the procedure I followed and it worked like champ.&nbsp; I use a static IP on my devbox to connect rather than DHCP.&nbsp; Once I get my standard set of packages loaded, I can hop into LUCI and go to town.&nbsp; </p><p>What exact process are you using?</p><p>-B</p>									</div>
