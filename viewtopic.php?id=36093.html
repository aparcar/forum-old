					<p>hello,<br />for a school project, I try to make little WAN-emulator on Mikrotik RB450g with OpenWRT (backfire).<br />the aim is to emulate the non-ideal parameters of the Internet - delays, jitter, packet loss, maybe some L1 errors (resulting in wrong ethernet frame FCS). if possible, do it in kernel-space.</p><p>I am trying to find out, where to write code for my stuff, but no success. for example, the algorithm for ethernet FCS -&gt; CRC32 is written in about 10-20 different files all over the source I downloaded from svn. Changing any of them did not produce any change in router&#039;s behavior, so I am starting to suspect, that I have no idea how the whole system works :)</p><p>I was searching for some documentation, to find out something about architecture of openWRT, to see, which source files are actually responsible for handling packets passing throug the router, but did not find anything :(</p><p>So my question is - which source files to work with to be able to manipulate with packets passing through?</p><p>thx very much</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenWrt is a meta distribution that configures and patches external software. You want to look at kernel.org for the Linux kernel sources, stuff is implemented within there. After you figured that out you have to add your additions in the form of patches to the Linux tree.</p>									</div>
