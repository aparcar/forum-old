					<p>As Tony doesnt have the toolchain files anymore, does anyone else have a copy of the toolchain lying around anywhere?<br />If so, could they post it online?</p><p>Thanks. Compiling a toolchain is a horrible job (as I&#039;ve found). Unfortunately the DG834GT router has a different endianness from the it&#039;s predecessor, so the WT54Gv2 toolchain is not compatible.</p><p>Craig</p>									</div>

					<p>I have a copy of what I think is the script used to build the toolchain files. Unfortunately I cannot get it to work as it keeps falling out for various errors. What I am currently trying out is the &#039;buildroot&#039; toolchain available from <a href="http://buildroot.uclibc.org">http://buildroot.uclibc.org</a>. This might be able to build a suitable toolchain for the DG834GT. I am trying it to see if it will build a toolchain suitable for an Inventel Livebox DV-4210 which has the same BCM6348 chip inside.<br />I also have a copy of the target_tinygt.tar.bz2 (the minimal distribution) if anyone wants a copy.</p><p>AndyP</p>									</div>
