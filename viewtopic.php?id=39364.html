					<p>Hi, I&#039;m trying to run a bash script in openwrt but I have a problem executing the xterm command, because it can&#039;t be found. So, there is an alternative or a way to install xterm in openwrt?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>I guess you&#039;re confusing something...</p><p>xterm is a program that shows a terminal on a GUI desktop in a window. It is by no means required to run a bash script.<br />Since OpenWRT (in almost all cases) has no gui, there&#039;s no need for a xterm program. You just ssh into the box and there<br />you&#039;ve got your console session.</p>									</div>

					<p>The matter is this:</p><p>I have the main script which calls the second script with the following command:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>for ROUTER in {1..10}
do
xterm -iconic -e $path/runscript $ROUTER &amp;
done</code></pre></div><p>and the runscript code is:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/bash
#!/usr/bin/expect -f

set arg1 [lindex $argv 0]
spawn ssh root@192.168.$arg1.1 ; 
expect password ; 
send &quot;12345\n&quot; ; 
expect &#039;~#&#039; ; 
send &quot;./script3.sh\n&quot; ; 
interact</code></pre></div><p>And the result is always:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>- bash: xterm: command not found
- bash: spaw: command not found
- bash: expect: command not found
- bash: send: command not found
- bash: interact: command not found</code></pre></div><p>Do you have any clue?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>ok, the first code pice would work this way:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>for ROUTER in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ; do
  $path/runscript $ROUTER &amp;
done</code></pre></div><p>But the latter one is more tricky because you&#039;re using the &#039;expect&#039; program there to enter the password on each host but there is no &#039;expect&#039; package for OpenWRT.</p><p>I would suggest you to use a different (and more secure) approach which would avoid having to set the same root password on each host and storing that in plaintext on your router:<br />Use authentication by public/private key.</p><p>First you need to create a pulic+private key pair on your OpenWRT box:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@openwrt:~# dropbearkey -t rsa -f master.key | grep &quot;^ssh-rsa&quot; &gt;master.key.pub</code></pre></div><p>then you copy the public key (master.key.pub) to each of your hosts that you want to ssh into and append the content of the file to the &#039;authorized_keys&#039; file of root (or any other user you want to login as):<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@slavemachine:~$ cat master.key.pub &gt;&gt;/root/.ssh/authorized_keys</code></pre></div><p>Now you should be able to ssh into your slave machines by using the private key file from the OpenWRT box, test it:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@openwrt:~# ssh -y -i master.key root@192.168.xx.xx</code></pre></div><p>And if that worked, you can use the technique in your script from above:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>for ROUTER in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ; do
  ssh -y -i /root/master.key root@192.168.$ROUTER.1 /root/script3.sh
done</code></pre></div><p>That should work. Guarantee is not included ;-)</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi and thanks for this info, it was really helpful!</p><p>The problem is I don&#039;t have only 1 Master and 9 slaves, I want each router to execute the scripts and interact to each other so that means that I would need one master key for each router and put it into every router I would connect to? </p><p>And another offtopic question would be if there is any way to know when the router is transmitting or receiving so I can make a condition like:</p><p>if (routertx==1){<br />...}</p><p>I have done a lot of research but the only thing I&#039;ve found it&#039;s related to the LEDs and triggers (http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/system in wify activity: phy0tx - flashes on transmission.) But I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s a variable neither if I can read from it how to do it.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>humid</strong> on 18 Sep 2012, 11:01)</p>
