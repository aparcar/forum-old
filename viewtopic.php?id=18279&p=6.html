					<p>I&#039;m having a small problem your built radengr, I find the wan port isn&#039;t working as expected.

					<div class="quotebox"><cite>fuhry wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Builds have been updated to include libiwinfo.</p></blockquote></div><p>Does that include repartitioning setup? I have just noticed that after Snarfing @fuhry&#039;s partitioning setup, I ended up without libiwinfo. I have tried installing libiw, but that was not enough to get the Wireless working. Repartitioning setup is based on Backfire 10.3 and libiwinfo is not listed in the package list (<a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03/ar71xx/packages/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … /packages/</a>).</p><p>So my question is: Can I have repartitioning setup with working wireless. I want the advantage of extra space without a compromise in functionality. I can obviously build my own images that will be based on latest backfire, but I will loose the special partitioning set up by @fuhry. Anyone knows which mtd&#039;s need to be erased updated coming from partitioned setup( 2816krootfs ) back to normal setup (2304k rootfs)?</p><p>Partitioning image file sizes.<br />Partition&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Stock by @fuhry&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Partitioned by @fuhry<br />mtd0 (u-boot)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 210,100&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 262,144<br />mtd1 (u-boot-env)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;65,536&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 65,536<br />mtd2 (rootfs)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2,170,884&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2,359,296<br />mtd3 (user-config)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; N/A&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;65,536<br />mtd4 (uImage)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 871,266&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,179,648<br />mtd5 (language_table)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; N/A&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;131,072<br />mtd6 (rootfs_checksum)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; N/A&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;65,536<br />mtd7 (ART)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;N/A&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;N/A</p><p>So going back to non-partitioned setup will involve erasing mtd 3,5,6 and overwriting the rest.

					<p>I would like to thank <strong>fuhry</strong> and <strong>radengr</strong> for their excellent work with the WNR2000v1. I was totally new to OpenWRT this evening - moved from DD-WRT because of the lack of support for this model, and with your instructions, I have successfully flashed my router. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>I intend to create a newbies guide to flashing this router for people like me who don&#039;t understand the full technical terms of everything. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/cool.png" width="15" height="15" alt="cool" /></p><p>I was wondering, now OpenWRT version 10.03.1-rc6 has been released (as of November 1st), is it possible / what are the benefits of downloading and flashing;</p><p><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1-rc6/ar71xx/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … c6/ar71xx/</a><strong>openwrt-ar71xx-ap81-rootfs-squashfs.bin</strong><br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1-rc6/ar71xx/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … c6/ar71xx/</a><strong>openwrt-ar71xx-uImage-lzma.bin</strong></p><p>Are <strong>radengr</strong>&#039;s files on post 129 patched specifically for the WNR2000v1 ? - or now the u-boot has been flashed - can you simply update to RC6 using the files above? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /></p><p>Only issues I have currently are; is there likely to be a fix to add the LED (i) on for internet connection on the WAN port (or even through LAN or virtual WWAN - maybe initiated by successful ping?) Default loading page on 192.168.1.1 (redirected to 192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/check_hijack.html) shows &quot; No such file or directory &quot;. Is there any way to automatically forward to &quot;192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/luci&quot; ? </p><p><img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/cool.png" width="15" height="15" alt="cool" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>outrage_uk</strong> on 30 Nov 2011, 06:19)</p>

					<p>I just flashed my WNR2000v1 with Backfire 10.03.1 final. Seems to be working well. The good thing is newer builds are a bit smaller now and so there doesn&#039;t seem to be any need to compile OpenWRT from source for this router anymore (unless you need something special?). After flashing I had 176 KB free.</p><p>Here are the instructions for *v1* only (all of this info is already in the thread, but just for good measure I&#039;m repeating some of it here). I strongly recommend doing this with a serial console. If you have one it is much harder to get stuck with a bricked router. It isn&#039;t that hard, you just need a cheap ttl level serial device. On ebay you can get one for *less* than $3 *shipped* with the cables you need for this router. Just search for &quot;USB 2.0 to UART TTL Serial Converter CP2102&quot; or similar. You don&#039;t absolutely have to have one, but it is good insurance. They are just handy to have around anyway, I have about 4 <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p><p>Installation instructions from a new router (running the Netgear Factory Firmware):</p><p>Somehow get access to a command prompt. This is either done by enabling telnet (see earlier in this thread or the wiki) or (my preferred method) hooking up a ttl level serial cable.</p><p>Then the following will install OpenWRT:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cd /tmp
snarf http://fuhry.co.cc/b/wnr2000/ubootenv-stockpartitions.img
snarf http://fuhry.co.cc/b/wnr2000/u-boot.bin
snarf http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-ap81-rootfs-squashfs.bin
snarf http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-uImage-lzma.bin
mtd -e mtd0 write u-boot.bin mtd0
mtd -e mtd1 write ubootenv-stockpartitions.img mtd1
mtd -e mtd2 write openwrt-ar71xx-ap81-rootfs-squashfs.bin mtd2
mtd -e mtd4 write openwrt-ar71xx-uImage-lzma.bin mtd4
reboot</code></pre></div><p>If you are running an older build of OpenWRT I haven&#039;t had much luck flashing without going through the Netgear firmware first. I haven&#039;t tried very hard either though so if someone has a better method please chime in. Remeber to download the factory firmware before wiping your router if that is going to leave you without internet access. To get back to the factory firmware you have two options:</p><p>The first (from OpenWRT):</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mtd erase u-boot-env
mtd erase uImage
reboot</code></pre></div><p>The second (from the uboot recovery console):</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mtdparts default
erase nor0,4
erase nor0,1</code></pre></div><p>Then reboot the router, tftp flash a copy of an official firmware from Netgear, and follow the instructions above. Enjoy, and thanks again to fuhry for patching uboot!</p>									</div>
