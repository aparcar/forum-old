					<p>Easy and to the point question.&nbsp; The best summary I&#039;ve found of the reasons + issues is <a href="https://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Multiple_WLANs">over at</a> DD-WRT. The tl;dr version: the router would need multiple BSSID capability to allocate different MACs (not just different SSIDs) to different virtual APs, and this is a hardware not OS capability so some devices or chips can do it and some can&#039;t. Also a bit about command line querying Broadcom&#039;s. Seems to match other comments online.</p><p>The OpenWRT device pages have a ton of info, but I can&#039;t find any hint in the specs/forum/wiki how to tell if different MAC per virtual AP is supported and achievable under OpenWRT for listed devices, when I buy one, or how to search for routers with that capability in the router platform databases. I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s chipset/driver related but that doesn&#039;t help much either.</p><p>So - my current shortlist is something like Linksys WRT1900AC or WRT1200AC, or similar spec (Netgear R7500/8000? TP-Link Archer C2600?), if that helps. But I&#039;d also like to know how to tell before buying for devices generally, in case something insanely decent spec&#039;ed and cheap suddenly turns up online to be bought&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> Or is this just misinformation/outdated?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stilez</strong> on 10 Apr 2016, 04:37)</p>
