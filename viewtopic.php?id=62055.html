					<p>I have 2 WD MyNet N750 routers operating as Primary and WDS AP+STA.<br />My configuration works without any issues thanks to the WDS Atheros guide.</p><p>But the thread provides no guidance on ipv6.

					<p>OK i see what you mean. However, i have never seen the proper ipv6 settings for using two routers running openwrt in WDS mode. If the settings were correct, i wouldn&#039;t have my (wired) NAS randomly receive a DHCPV6 lease from the 2nd router, even though it is weird to the primary router.</p><p>Maybe if there was only a single authoritative DHCPV6 server on the network, we wouldn&#039;t have this problem? So any ideas how to have only one dhcpv6 server running on the network?</p><p>In the meantime, i can disable the miniupnpd on the 2nd router.</p><p>Thanks and regards,<br />chhatc</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok. Just an FYI but I solved this problem.<br />It turned out that odhcpd is working just fine.<br />Plus, I set the dhcpv6 to &quot;relay&quot; and ra to &quot;relay&quot; on the wds client router (/etc/config/dhcp)<br />Now I&#039;ve got only one authoritative dhcpv6 server (the main router).</p><p>the issue with the SSDP was just miniupnpd as pointed out in the thread.<br />I disabled miniupnpd on the wds client and I stopped receiving the flood of ssdp messages in my syslog</p><p>thanks.<br />chhatc</p>									</div>
