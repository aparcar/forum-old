					<p>I would like to see a notepad option in the webinterface, Or a changelog, that can be backed up in the config file.</p><p>This way a changelog can later be used to turn in a config tutorial. etc.</p><p>Yea i know.. devs are swamped... just sharing the idea, since i can&#039;t write code.

					<p>Thanks,&nbsp; i hope this does the trick.&nbsp; <br />Would be cool though if the web gui had an option to add a text editor that could access all config files.<br />Even if it is read only that would save time, to be able to see quickly what gets changed when you change config settings in the GUI, then look in the text file without the need to also login in a console. <br />It would help me a lot to figure out some gui settings.&nbsp; the firewall for instance, there the Gui is better understandable then the text file.</p>									</div>

					<p>And it would be even cooler if LuCI would write a log of all the actions it performs.

It&#039;s a long set of LuCI commands but I can always get back to where I want to be.
