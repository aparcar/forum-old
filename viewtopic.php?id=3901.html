					<p>Hi there!</p><p>I&#039;ve been looking around this place for some weeks now but I couldn&#039;t find any recent status information on the AR7Port for the NetGear DG834GB-router. The latest information is from september as far as I can tell. Is anyone currently actively developing in that domain?</p><p>Unfortunately I can&#039;t do much more than test the AR7port since I&#039;m involved in other projects actively already and my work is taking much time. But if I can be of assistance anyways (i.e. providing you with information which you need to verify or check for the development) don&#039;t hesitate to contact me.</p><p>Happy new year!</p><p>Cheers<br />Koepi</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, it would be nice to see work done on this product.&nbsp; I would certainly be interested and although i&#039;m not able to do any development work, I would be glad to provide testing and feedback assistance.&nbsp; It&#039;s a nice little package and I&#039;m sure it can do more than the netgear firmware provides.</p>									</div>
