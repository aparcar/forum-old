					<p>When installing new packages on my WL-500gP V2, I see the following warnings in the logs:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Warning: DQ5 raised while program operation was in progress, however operation completed OK</code></pre></div><p>The warning may appear multiple (e.g. 3) times for each package, however everything seems to work correctly.</p><p>As I remember from the old times when I was writing a hardware FLASH controller for FPGA in VHDL, DQ5 going high does not always mean, that the operation has failed, especially if one uses the &quot;data polling&quot; algorithm to monitor the status of the operation (details here <a href="http://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content_type/white_papers_and_tech_docs/22358B.pdf">http://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content â€¦ 22358B.pdf</a>, e.g. in the figure 5).</p><p>Is the above message normal, and may be ignored, or does it mean that some parameters in the OpenWRT require adjustment on this particular platform?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wzab</strong> on 24 Mar 2008, 15:04)</p>
