					<p>Hi All</p><p>Thought I might mention to the brave, I picked up a TL-WR1043ND v1.10 today to give me something to use since I bricked my v1.8 on a bad sysupgrade from trunk to AA beta 2. Both show the same symptoms, where the device boots up, all LEDs flash for one moment, then the router goes into a &quot;switch only&quot; mode where there is no sys light, just power and NIC activity lights, and it does switch between each of the ports but does nothing more than that, certainly doesn&#039;t allow any sort of failsafe boot.</p><p>I have a TTL cable on the way but thought I might warn people since the 1.10 is a new hardware revision and not mentioned in the wiki yet, and I&#039;m unable to update the wiki page, certainly beware that uploading the backfire 10.03.1 image directly on the stock firmware (via LAN of course) has bricked it.</p>									</div>

					<p>didn&#039;t you tried to access via the SSH panel???<br />AA doesn&#039;t have the WEB UI by default.. the only way is through TELNET, SSH.. unless you install the web UI...<br /> OPenwrt by default doesn&#039;t have enable the wifi by default you need to enable it by yourself....<br /> so... just check if it is accesible by SSH (see putty) if it is? then you don&#039;t need to open up your router...</p>									</div>

I&#039;ve got a new brand in amazon and in the S/N sticker says Model TL-WR1043ND(DE) v1.2 the S/N starts with 129... and I think is equivalent to TL-WR1043ND v1.10. </p><p>The problem that I have is no access via IP, but no access via serial TTL/USB cable either.

					<p>Sorry, I have a TTL-USB cable which allows serial access to the Router board. I connect the cable&nbsp; to an USB port on my computer, on one side, and to the serial pins of the board on the other side. Then I run the TFTP32 program on teh computer, and the putty with the known parameters: 115.200 bps, 8 bits, 1 stop, 0,0 but the putty screen keeps blank (or black better).<br />Normally in all the foros says you can rescue a bricked router through serial access, but I can&#039;t get it.<br />Thank you for your interest, and sorry for my english.</p>									</div>
