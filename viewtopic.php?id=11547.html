					<p>I&#039;m having trouble getting WDS working between 2 kamikaze devices.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to use my existing device (wrtsl54gs) as my gateway and &quot;primary&quot; AP, and extend the network using a newly purchased whr-hp-g54.</p><p>However, I can&#039;t seem to make this work.&nbsp; I&#039;ve followed various bits of advice I&#039;ve found on the forums to no avail.&nbsp; I&#039;ve crafted the following config files, but I seem to be missing something.</p><p>Here is my configuration on the already-in-use linksys:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@wrtsl54gs:/etc/config# cat wireless

					<p>Thanks for the reply - now I have another question.&nbsp; Would I be best served by moving to SVN, or can I update some scripts on my existing 7.06 installs to make WDS work?&nbsp; I don&#039;t have any other issues with 7.06, so I don&#039;t necessarily want to upgrade if I can avoid it.</p><p>Also, can anybody verify that my configuration above looks correct?</p>									</div>

					<p>You can&#039;t set your AP to psk and then set the WDS link to unencrypted (or vice versa). WDS should be set to psk (but you can set the AP to any combination of psk/psk2).</p><p>In terms of files that need to be updated to fix wds:<br />(package: filename)<br />base-files-brcm-2.4: /lib/network/config.sh<br />wlc: /sbin/wlc<br />wlc: /etc/hotplug.d/net/20-broadcom_wds</p><p>Given the number of other bugs that have been fixed post 7.06 it&#039;d probably make more sense to wait for the 7.07 release. If you&#039;re really impatient, there&#039;s some early binaries here - <a href="http://nbd.openwrt.org/kamikaze">http://nbd.openwrt.org/kamikaze</a> but I wouldn&#039;t call it a beta, release canidate or anything of the sort; we&#039;re still writing 7.07.</p>									</div>

					<p>I just wanted to mention that everything is working now thanks to the advice above.&nbsp; Using the missing bits from mbm&#039;s pre-release packages enabled WDS to work flawlessly on my 7.06 devices.</p><p>Thanks again.</p>									</div>
