					<p>Hi,<br />I have Asus RT N16 router with trunk version of OpenWrt on it. At my home I have a Openvpn netwrok.<br />Problem is, when I connect router between home network and my computer, router recieves IP from the OpenVpn server, as my WAN is running DHCP, when my computer recieves IP from the router. This make me unable to connect to OpenVpn server and use internet.<br />On network with no openvnp connection I have no problem with this configuration.<br />What should I do in order to connnect to OpenVpn server at home. Once I had a wild idea to change Lan from static to DHCP and was lucky I made it possible to connect to router from WAN interface and sort things out.<br />So please help me. I am new in this area and I don&#039;t want to brick my router guessing what has to be done.<br />Thank you!</p>									</div>

					<p>Fair point.<br />Some screens showing how my interfaces are set up.<br />As you may see WAN get IP from dormitory&#039;s IP range, when my computer get it from routers IP range<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://img703.imageshack.us/i/unled1s.jpg/" alt="http://img703.imageshack.us/i/unled1s.jpg/" /></span></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://img196.imageshack.us/i/unled2y.jpg/" alt="http://img196.imageshack.us/i/unled2y.jpg/" /></span></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://img33.imageshack.us/i/unled3f.jpg/" alt="http://img33.imageshack.us/i/unled3f.jpg/" /></span></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://img840.imageshack.us/i/unled4l.jpg/" alt="http://img840.imageshack.us/i/unled4l.jpg/" /></span><br />The firewall conf file was left without any changes. Only thing I&#039;ve dont was to allow UDP for remote backup.<br />OpenVpn was not intalled by default. I installed it, but left witohut any changes.<br />I&#039;ve decided to try out one thing: attach Wifi interface to WAN, connect my PC to wifi. I was able to log in and use internet. Problem is the conflict between WAN and LAN interfaces, when it come to a network specific, such as one using OpenVpn. As I mentioned before, on a normal netwrok everything works great, with WAN getting IP from fx schools DHCP server and laptop getting IP from router IP range.<br />I really don&#039;t want to experiment, as last time when I changed my LAN from static, to DHCP, I was unable to connect to router from LAN interface.<br />Could use an advice on how to be able to connect to my Openvpn server from my laptop, while router&#039;s wan being connected to dormitory&#039;s network and my laptop being connected to router&#039;s LAN port.<br />Hope was more specific this time <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />, otherwise can look into the conf files for firewall and openvpn.<br />Thanks for any kind of help, as this is very important for me. I looked all around internet for same problem as I am having, but seems there was nothing that could help me.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>AleksandrK</strong> on 12 Apr 2011, 14:38)</p>
