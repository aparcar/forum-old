					<p>Hi,</p><p>I was wondering if it is possible to connect two or more sites, into a single subnet.</p><p>For instance<br />Site A<br />Router 192.168.1.1<br />DHCP pool (locally handed out) .50-.100</p><p>Site B<br />Router 192.168.1.2<br />DHCP pool (locally handed) .101-.150</p><p>Site C<br />Router 192.168.1.3<br />DHCP pool (locally handed out) .151-.200</p><p>Each site uses their own router as default gateway for outgoing internet traffic.</p><p>Traffic within the subnet, e.g. from a NAS on site B to a computer in site A will be transmitted as if the nodes were on the same LAN.</p><p>Is there anyone who has an idea if this is possible, and if so, how?</p>									</div>

					<p>It is possible: <br />From your requirements:<br />- &quot;two or more sites&quot; -&gt; thats often called Site 2 Site<br />- &quot;on the same LAN&quot; -&gt; implies TAP (L2)</p><p>googling &quot;site to site tap&quot; results in one hit at openvpn documentation:<br /><a href="http://docs.openvpn.net/how-to-tutorialsguides/virtual-platforms/site-to-site-layer-2-bridging-using-openvpn-access-server/">http://docs.openvpn.net/how-to-tutorial â€¦ ss-server/</a></p><p>I did have a quick look at the OpenWrt wiki but as far as I see there is no such config there</p>									</div>

					<p>No, it would not be a problem if the hosts on the different sites are on a different subnet.</p><p>As long as a host on subnet 192.168.1.x would be able to reach a host on subnet 192.168.2.x.</p><p>If I setup a site to site VPN using openvpn, would the hosts in the different subnets be able to see each other on the LAN?<br />(e.g. Windows file share available)</p>									</div>
