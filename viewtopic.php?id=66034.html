					<p>Hello. </p><p>I have just spent 6 hours trying to figure out how to do this. </p><p>I have a TL-WDR4900 router running Chaos Calmer, 15.05 r46767. I&#039;m using Luci - don&#039;t know much about command line. </p><p>What I would like to do is to setup an FTP server on a Windows 7 machine. I&#039;m using Filezilla FTP server. </p><p>I have a Raspberry Pi 2 running SSH server, forwarded from WAN port 2022 to the local IP on port 22 - it works. Port forwarding definitely works. I can connect from my phone using mobile data. </p><p>I set the server up to use passive mode, listening on port 14577, and I have forwarded a range of ports from 48000 to 49000. In Luci I have configured it with external port as 14577 and choosing to forward those to 48000-49000. I get a connection denied error. And on canyouseeme.org I get &#039;we could not see your service on port 14577&#039;. </p><p>However, I have tried to set up the server using FTPS on port 990. That works.&nbsp; </p><p>Please tell me what I&#039;m missing. This should be a simple setting. Is it not possible to forward a range of ports using Luci? </p><p>Best regards <br />Hvilsted</p>									</div>

It had always been working well but the control of the router was so limited that I wanted to run OpenWRT instead. </p><p>Also if I Google &#039;forward range of ports OpenWRT&#039; there&#039;s hits with &#039;syntax is start:end&#039;. However, Luci wants - to separate start and end, documentation for the firewall UCI says : to separate. </p><p>I&#039;m left clueless.</p>									</div>
