					<p>Hi all,<br />I tried to flash a new TL WR703 from TP-LINK, which bought in china, with this snap shot <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr703n-v1-squashfs-factory.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … actory.bin</a><br />When I try to upload, I got an chines error number.

					<p>27kb doesn&#039;t seem possible for the original image.&nbsp; What size is your openWrt image (current is 3,932,160)?&nbsp; I successfully flashed trunk to a V 1.6 703N a month or two ago.&nbsp; Perhaps try one of the Sam&#039;s firmware images or Backfire.</p>									</div>

					<p>I tried again to download the original image from the TP, but it is still 27Kb. I think they changed something in the original FW. 3.12.11 Build 120228 Rel.43313<br />The funny thing is, that I can upload that 27Kb file, and it works!<br />This evening I&#039;ll try to flash one of Sam&#039;s firmwares.</p>									</div>
