Not sure if I&#039;m allowed to post the firmware file itself here.</p><p>As I posted before, I may have to fiddle with the settings a bit, as I&#039;m getting an Annex B connection, but I&#039;ve set it to Annex A, which seems a bit strange. Guess I&#039;ll have to try a few settings to see if it something improves. But, maybe it&#039;s just that Telfort uses a different lantiq firmware .bin</p><p>Therefore, I was hoping someone had root access to the original latest Telfort firmware to extract the lantiq firmware and settings.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config globals &#039;globals&#039;
