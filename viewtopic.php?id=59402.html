					<p>Hi, </p><p>i&#039;m having several issues trying to make this work on my WNDR4300 router. Using a custom build based on trunk with two different usb cards (ath9k_htc and RTL8188cus) chipsets and cannot make it work. For example if I use RTL8188cus with driver RTL8192cu compiled for that build,&nbsp; ifconfig hangs and I cannot see any errors it just dies there (no kernel panic since I can close ssh session and login again). <br />Using the Ath9k_htc card (no extra drivers) enables me to scan but, i get no results and then I get an error on luci (don&#039;t have it know but it was related to the scan parsing) . </p><p>Don&#039;t really know how to troubleshoot it. Can somebody guide me on this or point me to the right direction?. Would be extremely thankful.</p><p>Thanks in advance !</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Panderine</strong> on 4 Sep 2015, 16:01)</p>
