					<p>Hello there,</p><p>I&#039; ve been trying to get my network configuration working, but I face the same problem everytime. I want to use 2 (wired) routers: they both broadcast a wireless network and they are connected by a wire (from lan 1 to lan 4, so not to the ethernet port). Now, one of these routers is a DLink (main router, dhcp enabled, ip 192.168.0.1), with the original firmware, and the other one is running openWRT (connected to main router, ip (before changes were made:) 192.168.1.1, dhcp was enabled before changes were made...). <br />I would like to create one big network with all the computers connected to one of the two routers: wired/wireless to router one/two, they all should have internet-access and network-access (windows shares etc).<br />I figured that I should set the static ip of the openwrt router to an ip in the same subnet (192.168.0.*) as the main router, that is free: not in use by any connected computer/not in the dhcp-range), and then disable the dhcp server from the openWRT router. So I did this, and everything is working (internet, shares, ...), except one thing: I lost all access to the openWRT router: SSH/Telnet/Luci-interface, I can&#039;t even ping it. I am sure I am using the right ip-address: I use a lan-scanning utility <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.<br />Can any-one help me solving this problem? I would like to regain access to the router! (I guess that I&#039;ll have to &quot;firstboot&quot; it, and that&#039;s ok, i know all other settings <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />)</p><p>Thanks!<br />Skwirrelww</p>									</div>
