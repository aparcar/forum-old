					<p>Hey Guys,</p><p>I have a few questions about AP and hostapd:</p><p>1) Does anyone know what&#039;s running on OpenWrt when we set it up as an AP? Is it hostapd process?<br />I am curious because it doesn&#039;t have hostapd.conf file that it&#039;s reading. I remember that I was modifying /etc/config/wireless as the configuration file instead.</p><p>2) If it some sort of hostapd that specialized for OpenWrt, then I am wondering if anyone knows how we can make it work with multiple keys like what hostapd does; basically one password per one device/MAC address.</p><p>Any help/insights would be appreciated. Thanks all!</p>									</div>

					<p>The UCI system parses /etc/config/wireless and generates hostapd.conf and wpa-supplicant.conf files in /var/run (which is a RAM disk).&nbsp; Then it launches hostapd and/or wpa-supplicant referenced to those configs.&nbsp; The actual programs should be very similar to those used on big Linux distributions.</p>									</div>

					<p>I wish to use the wpa_psk_file option in hostapd.conf so that I can specify a different PSK for each MAC address that I have. Is this even possible to do with UCI? I don&#039;t seem to find the correct options here: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless</a></p><p>Is it possible to bypass UCI to set up just the wireless part? For example, if I change the hostapd.conf and just restart the hostapd process without restarting the system, so that UCI won&#039;t rewrite all the .conf files?</p>									</div>
