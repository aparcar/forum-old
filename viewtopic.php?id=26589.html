					<p>You did use the correct image, however, the wr841n has had a lot of work done on it in the past weeks. The 10.03.1 rc3 firmware works significantly better, and has all the needed packages built in. You&#039;ll run into some serious and annoying bugs running 10.03.&nbsp; Use the firmware from here: <br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1-rc3/ar71xx/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 â€¦ c3/ar71xx/</a><br />Be sure to use the &quot;systemupgrade&quot; firmware. </p><p>~Jonathan</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for your input. Is this the right procedure: </p><p>--&gt; Install <strong>openwrt-ar71xx-tl-wr841nd-v5-squashfs-factory.bin</strong> --&gt; then install <strong>openwrt-ar71xx-tl-wr841nd-v5-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin</strong>?<br />I&#039;m currently running the original FW again, so can I go straight for the sysupgrade image or do I have to follow the above procedure?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>l1n00x</strong> on 16 Sep 2010, 18:45)</p>

					<p>If you are running the stock firmware (The TP-link firmware), then you have to use the &quot;...factory.bin&quot; image. <br />If you are running Openwrt, then use the &quot;...sysupgrade.bin&quot; image.</p><p>Other than that, there is no advantage to using the sysupgrade firmware. When I said to use &quot;systemupgrade&quot; in my original post, it was only because you said you had already flashed. </p><p>Since you&#039;re back to running stock, use the &quot;factory.bin&quot; firmware.</p><p>~Jonathan</p>									</div>
