					<p>I&#039;ve been trying to set up QoS on my WRT54GL which is running Kamikaze 7.09, I&#039;ve followed the QoSHowto and everything seems to go smoothly without any errors. But when I start up ÂµTorrent my google.com ping goes from 40ms to 400ms and webpages almost timeout because they load so slowly. ÂµTorrent&#039;s traffic should be set to bulk by the default layer7 bittorrent option right? and if that doesn&#039;t work it shouldn&#039;t it be set to bulk by the 1024-65535 port range? I&#039;ve tried setting the layer7 http filter to priority and still doesn&#039;t work...</p><p>I&#039;ve both edited the /etc/config/qos as well as tried editing uci qos.cfg... is there anything command that has to be run after editing the config file?</p>									</div>

					<p>Are you trying to set up QOS for all users of unprivileged ports (1025+)? In that case, your web traffic may be getting caught in the same bucket that is dealing with your BT traffic. Then again, I&#039;ve never set this up and am only going on general networking knowledge.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t use uTorrent, but an other client, if I set it to use encrypt protocol, the bittorrent stream can&#039;t be understood by lay7 filter, so it treat as normal priority. So I just don&#039;t use encryption, I think port range qos setting should also works but I don&#039;t bother to set it up.</p>									</div>

					<p>Would be nice if some1 explained how to setup a working torrent client on 1 PC or on the router itself and for example a prioritized gaming machine or VOIP client.</p>									</div>

					<p>QoS is a concept, it&#039;s implementation is very complex and different for everyone (depending on personal preferences and network situation), so it&#039;s not something you can just explain in 2, 3 sentences and walk away... some ready to use scripts that come with a config file, like qos-scripts, are supposed to make it easier, but it doesn&#039;t help if the syntax of the config file itself isn&#039;t documented and if one does not understand the ideas behind it. So all you can do is either try and see if any of the ready to use solutions (qos-scripts and alternatives, see wiki) work out of the box for you, or can be easily modified to fit your needs. If all else fails you have to learn about networking, traffic, QoS, and the way it&#039;s handled in Linux and build your own solution.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hmm... kinda strange but I removed all the default qos-script options and just added a layer7 bittorrent, and a per-2-per bittorrent bulk option and my web traffic loaded a little faster but my ping was still really high. Then I set ports 80,81 to express and now my web browser loads almost as fast as when I&#039;m not downloading or uploading anything. I think some of the default options interfere with getting utorrent set to bulk. Not been able to get my ping lower than 100ms though.</p>									</div>
