					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am a part time network administrator to some SOHO sized companies which I help out with giving advice and administrating their wired and wireless networks. I&#039;ve mainly worked with the following routers: WNDR3700, Apple AP&#039;s and Draytek Vigor vpn routers with RADIUS servers, but also some work with Cisco IOS switches and routers. Because of my IT experience I think of myself as &quot;well known&quot; person in this field, but not an expert. I don&#039;t make custom firmware software or something. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>I was asked to give advice to a friend who has some specific requirements for wireless guest networks. I thought &quot;maybe that is possible with custom firmware like DD-WRT or Open-WRT, but I would have to find out&quot;. That is why I am here now. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><br /><p>Can someone give me advice if the following is possible with custom scripting or programming? <br /><strong><em>Note I am not asking HOW I do this.</em></strong> I just first want to find out if it is possible at all..</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>1.) If there <span class="bbu">is</span> traffic going over the normal wireless network, enable a bandwidth control on the Guest network. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(For example, if someone is using their own wifi, the guest network is restricted to 2Mbps.)<br />2.) If there is <span class="bbu">no</span> traffic going over the normal wireless network, disable the bandwidth control on the Guest network.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(If no users are using wifi, I dont care about the quality/bandwidth degration caused by Guest users.)<br />3.) Can a router calculate an approximation of the ACTUAL <strong>available</strong> wireless speeds per client? <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11n-2009#Data_rates">MCS index/modulation</a> *50% I imagine?)</p></blockquote></div><p>Thanks for the advice!

You can configure which clients/protocols/ports,... in your LAN (and WLAN), or Internet get which priority. And it makes sure that the traffic you set to &quot;Express, or Priority&quot; get the needed bandwith, and that traffic set to bulk, get as much bandwith as possible, but doesn&#039;t constrain any other traffic. </p><p>To your setup.. when I get it right, you want to be able to allow guest to use your WLAN, but you don&#039;t want to be constrained by them. This would be exactly the setup I suggested. The traffic on the WAN interface is limited, so it doesn&#039;t matter if the traffic is coming from LAN or WLAN. <br />I would recommend bridging LAN and WLAN, and create a separate wifi-interface for the guest-WLAN and don&#039;t bridge it to the other interfaces. create an own firewall zone and limit the traffic appropriate (e.g. only internet access). this interface would have it own subnet, so it&#039;s easy to write a qos-rules for them (e.g. set them to bulk-traffic) <br />this way the guests get only up to about 20% of your bandwith if you need it yourself, but they can use up to 80% of the bandwith if the connection is idle. It&#039;s not a good idea to let them use 100% if the connection is idle, because you (LAN+WLAN) would experience a lag/delay of you initiate new traffic until the bulk-traffic is trottled enough to allow this traffic. This is the reason why bulk traffic can use up to about 80% <br />So this is the default setup and it works quite well at my place, if you want to change the characteristic of the qos-rules you could try to tweak the part of /etc/config/qos which starts with: # Don&#039;t change the stuff below unless you really know what it means <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> </p><p>... and try to figure out what it means first <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Eleon,</p><p>Thanks for your advice! I could follow most of what you said. Had to read up a bit about the bulk bucket to fully understand what you meant with that. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> I understand now I can put different priorities to the different subnets (Guest network on its own isolated network). Thanks for your advice for the 80-20 instead of 100-0. Makes sense ofcourse. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I understand that QoS is normally performed on the WAN interface, and that is how I usually see it used. I&#039;ve never seen it used on the (W)LAN side, so that&#039;s why I asked. The plan is to use a double WAN interface so the guest network gets a dedicated WAN bandwidth. So I don&#039;t have to worry about the WAN QoS, because each subnet already has its own dedicated bandwidth.&nbsp; My whole worry is the quality degradation of the wireless network, because guests users are using the same spectrum/bandwidth as the normal wirelessnetwork users.</p><p>The problem which Im breaking my head on is that the wireless bandwidth can be between 10 ~ 70 Mbps, depending on the location of the wireless router. But how would I know how to setup the QoS on the wireless clients automatically?</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry for the late reply eleon, I had to read up on your WMM links. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I think WMM is needed yeah, but not just WMM because if I put all the guest traffic in the background-priority, the guest users might experience bad latency as well. From what I understand the minimum-wait (AIFSN) is increased in the background-priority. So I imagine that a solution would be to add another class so you have best-effort-high and best-effort-low. From what I read, you can&#039;t limit the max bandwidth with WMM. Its more a queue priority system from what I understand</p><p>Back to bulk QoS. From what I understand, the following must be possible, correct?</p><p> * Normal LAN network: 10.0.1.0/24<br /> * Normal WLAN network: 10.0.2.0/24<br /> * Guest WLAN network: 10.0.3.0/24<br /> &gt; Put the Priority of the normal LAN and WLAN higher then that of the Guest-WLAN<br /> &gt; Using the Bulk class, limit the Guest-WLAN ip range to 5Mbit/sec when no traffic is flowing from the Normal-WLAN ip range</p><p>That last point is doable by setting a &quot;option maxsize x&quot; in the bulk class, am I right? Or is that the maximum size of a packet? Is there a way to set the bandwidth limit in a bulk class instead of a percentage using maxrate? (Reason Im asking is because I can&#039;t be sure of the 100% bandwidth of the wifi, that is different for each location/hotspot.</p>									</div>
