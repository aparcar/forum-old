					<p>Hi, I&#039;m looking for a self-contained device, like the TP-Link M5360 (except that doesn&#039;t yet work with OpenWRT). I&#039;ve got a WR703N and a USB 3G dongle, but I&#039;m looking for an all-in-one, self powered device. USB port that OpenWRT can use is essential (I want to connect a USB device to the mobile internet, so a charge-only port won&#039;t do). WiFi nice for playing but not needed.<br />Any ideas?<br />Thanks,<br />Bill</p>									</div>
