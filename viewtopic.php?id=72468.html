					<p>Is there a way to check if the password entered for the wifi is correct other than looking at the logs? I&#039;m looking at the dmesg logs for now, to check if there is a 4WAY_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT. But it hasn&#039;t proved to be very reliable so far. I want a reliable way to tell when my wireless client is not connecting to the router because of a mistake in entering the password.</p><p>Thanks<br />Aravind</p>									</div>

					<p>I think that is by design.&nbsp; The AP ignores someone using the wrong password rather than tell them it is incorrect.&nbsp; This makes it harder to brute-force attack the AP by trying different passwords.</p><p>You could use 802.1X (WPA Enterprise) to have a log of both successful and unsuccessful logins.&nbsp; That requires setting up a RADIUS server which can be inside or outside the router.</p>									</div>
