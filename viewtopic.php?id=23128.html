					<p>I hope this isn&#039;t a FAQ item, I couldn&#039;t find much on it. I have an old WRT54G v1.1 that I have been running 7.09 on for quite some time now without a problem. I decided to upgrade it to 8.09.1 (2.4) but when I do the wireless doesn&#039;t work as the wl module errors out when it tries to load. I have tried both 8.09.1 and 8.09.2 RC2 with the same result from these images:</p><p><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09.1/brcm-2.4/openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8 … uashfs.trx</a><br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09.2-RC2/brcm-2.4/openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8 … uashfs.trx</a></p><p>Then I thought maybe I should be using the 47xx images because that model has a BCM4710 processor but those images seem to be missing a lot of stuff (iwconfig, iwlist, and much more) and the wireless module doesn&#039;t work on it either (along with a lot more) so I guess those 47xx images probably aren&#039;t for what I thought they were. So I reinstalled my 7.09 backup and now I&#039;m back to where I was before trying the upgrade. Should the new brcm-2.4 8.09.* images work on this router or is there a known problem or is there something special I have to configure to make the wireless interface work in the new 8.* versions of the OS?</p>									</div>

					<p>This is my understanding, and I may be wrong.&nbsp; Wifi for WRT54G (and all 47xx) is not available in 8.09.1 and 8.09.2rc2 for 2.6 kernels, but should be available in 2.4.&nbsp; Wifi for 2.6 is available in trunk but it lacks some 2.4 configuration programs (with Broadcom proprietary code), but has others.&nbsp; Some features are not available at this time, for instance, apparently, client bridge.&nbsp; It seems 8.09.2 is in the process of being released, and it may have the same features as what is in trunk.&nbsp; </p><p>If others have more precise or more correct or more complete information, please provide.</p>									</div>

					<p>As I stated, I am trying to use the 2.4 firmware and the wl module will not load (thus no wi0 interface). It works fine in 7.09 (2.4 kernel) but not 8.09.(2.4 kernel).</p>									</div>

					<p>In 8.09.2 the proprietary broadcom driver was updated to a newer version. Broadcom dropped support for certain older chipsets in this driver revision, this affects the Wrt54G v1.1 as well. Your only choices here are 7.09 or a very recent trunk with kernel 2.6 and b43legacy.</p><p>~ JoW</p>									</div>
