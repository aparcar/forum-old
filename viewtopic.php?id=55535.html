					<p>Hi,</p><p>I recently flashed OpenWrt to my Vizio XWR100. I couldn&#039;t get internet actually working though, so I followed the instructions <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=34277">here</a> because I thought they would work for this browser. Basically, I took the stock firmware from the Vizio website, renamed it &quot;firm.bin,&quot; copied it to /tmp on my router through WinSCP, and ran<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mtd -r write firm.bin firmware</code></pre></div><p>I think it&#039;s bricked now...when I connect my computer to the router via ethernet and ping it as I turn the router off and then on again, I always either get a time out or host unreachable. This is when my computer is configured to have static IP 192.168.1.2.</p><p>A serial cable is coming, but in the meantime, what can I do? What are my chances of saving the router? And what should I do with the serial cable once it comes (like how do I flash OpenWrt back on it...I&#039;ve looked at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.flashing.serial">this</a> but what should the offset and size be)</p><br /><p>Edit: based on <a href="https://wikidevi.com/wiki/VIZIO_XWR100#cat_.2Fproc.2Fmtd">this</a> I&#039;m guessing that the XWR100 doesn&#039;t actually have a &quot;firmware&quot; mtd, so my mtd command just wrote the .bin somewhere random? Do you think uboot and the important stuff was overwritten?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sammymax</strong> on 3 Feb 2015, 00:39)</p>

					<p>The serial cable came! When the OpenWrt wiki says pin 1, does that refer to the pin on the left side, when looking at the router facing the front? Also is it okay not to plug in VCC?</p><p>I&#039;m connecting with Putty and mashing Ctrl-C while the router turns on and nothing is showing...</p><p><strong>Edit:</strong> got tx/Rx mixed up, whoops. It&#039;d be great if someone can give me assistance flashing.</p><p><strong>Edit:</strong> I got this working...I took the linux image and rootfs from <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=229486#p229486">link</a>. I used ymodem, from Extra Putty, to transfer the linux image from my computer to the router (since ethernet seemed to be down) and then did the same for the rootfs. Instructions 9-13 from <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndap360">here</a> helped me a lot--basically, just replace tftpboot with loady and use the proper addresses/file sizes. I put the linux image at 0xbf040000 and the rootfs at 0xbf1b0000. I sort of guessed on the latter address and I wasn&#039;t sure if that was correct, so I did a sysupgrade to a clean OpenWrt after rebooting the router.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sammymax</strong> on 5 Feb 2015, 02:37)</p>
