					<p>Hi,<br />I returned to original firmware on my WR1043, using &quot;<em>TL-WR1043ND-V1-FW0.0.3-stripped.bin</em>&quot; and cannot login to device any more.<br />During installation all went ok. Rebooting fine as well. Login screen is in place, but cannot accept any user/password combinations.</p><p>So far I tried (user/password):<br /></p><ul><li><p>admin/admin<br />admin/password<br />admin/root<br />root/root<br />root/admin<br />root/password</p></li></ul><p>and nothing is working.</p><p>Do you know more?</p><p>I also tried to login via telnet, but ruter is refusin connection (on port 23).</p><p>Any idea what I can try next?</p><p>Regards<br />Greg</p>									</div>

					<p>The OEM firmware doesn&#039;t have a telnetd or sshd running, the only method of access is the webinterface via http, the default access credentials being admin/ admin. While not necessary, resetting the router (again) won&#039;t hurt.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m afraid something went wrong during flashing.<br />Is there any way to upgrade firmware without need to login via webinterface? Without telnet or ssh, might be difficult...<br />Once I flashed router via Rx/Tx, but maybe there is another, more easy, way to make sysupgrade?</p>									</div>

					<p>That depends...</p><p>Originally, the bootloader shipped with the TL-WR1043ND v1 didn&#039;t have the tftp rescue mode enabled, TP-Link changed that only very late during their firmware maintenance. Depending on the last vendor firmware version ever installed on your device, it might be available - or not, you just have to try (checking for tftp requests in wiresharknis a good idea).</p><p>The only other alternative would be to connect a TTL-level serial console (requires opening the caseand soldering).</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks. I will try with tftp, but just one question...<br />If I&#039;m not mistaken, by tftp I can only upload firmware to the router. How then run installation?</p>									</div>

					<p>That TTTT means either transferred blocks or timeouts (while waiting for blocks). I see something similar as timeout symbols in a Netgear bootloader when it looks for possible servers during early boot.</p><p>Are you sure you have a TFTP server running on 196.168.0.5 (and its possible firewall allows incoming TFTP connecitons?)</p>									</div>
