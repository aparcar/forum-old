					<p>Well, the clone command creates a non-standard source repo for you. So, basically you should ask help at 8devices forums (or whatever).</p><p>If you check your feeds.conf.default, you will notice that it defines several source trees from 8devices, and all Openwrt feeds are pulled from a certain ancient commits. &quot;oldpackages&quot; in totally unsupported. so, you may run into errors that havea already been fixed in the proper Openwrt source repos since 8devices created their copy.<br /><a href="https://github.com/8devices/carambola2/blob/master/feeds.conf.default">https://github.com/8devices/carambola2/ â€¦ nf.default</a></p><p>You might ignore those &quot;no feed&quot; warnings, as they should not hurt you.<br />Do a &quot;make menuconfig&quot; or &quot;make defconfig&quot; after the feed installation to check all dependencies.</p><p>And if you get errors with &quot;make&quot;, do it singlethreaded without &quot;j 3&quot;, and you will get more informative error messages. Btw, what is the error message? you never mentioned it....</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, it looks like you have ran into a faulty server when downloading package sources. Either a certificate problem (based on your log) or an other dead server (my own try). Trying <a href="http://nbd.name/gitweb.cgi?o=age">nbd.name/gitweb.cgi?o=age</a> in web browser does not work, either. (It is the home site of a core Openwrt developer, so it should be up.)</p><p>Too bad. Not much you (or anybody) can do except to wait a few hours for the server to be back up again.</p><p>To separate download problems from other compilation problems, you might do &quot;make download&quot; first. That should download all package sources to &lt;buildroot&gt;/dl so that they area then ready for the actual &quot;make&quot;.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 2 Sep 2015, 16:36)</p>
