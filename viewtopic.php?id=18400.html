					<p>I should probably look at the supported devices list but thought of asking in this forum anyway. My application needs video camera using USB and WIFI. Can someone please recommend the ideal hardware. I have already purchased ASUS WLGP500 V2 and Logitech STS Messenger Camera but it does not work. Camera needs 2.6 kernel and wifi works on 2.4!!! I am willing to try out other combinations of hardware.</p>									</div>

					<p>Go by the driver you want, then buy the cam in question. I&#039;m using gscpa on a really bad cam on 2.6 with success on a WL-500gP v1.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I still not buyed it but I read somewhere the Logitech Quickcam Sphere AF could be used with uvc driver and uvc-streamer. When buyed I will try and can give feedback.</p><p>The advantage of this webcam is the fact it has a 2million webcam and its also automatic following mode.</p><p>Have a nice day and please send us a feedback for your experience.</p><p>Sincerely thanks,</p><p>Miguipda ;-)</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />Please do not use the outdated version &quot;uvc-streamer&quot;, I do not update it anymore! MJPG-streamer supports all the features and more and is still updated (from time to time).</p><p>The &quot;following mode&quot; will not work, neither with uvc-streamer nor mjpg-streamer. If someone implements it I would immedialty apply his patches. Your participation in the mjpg-streamer project is welcome.</p><p>Anyway, you can pan, tilt and focus the webcam manually through the webinterface.</p><p>For supported hardware compression modes please see <a href="http://johnarthur.wordpress.com/2008/03/29/further-notes-on-the-nslu2-and-quickcam-pro-9000/#more-21">http://johnarthur.wordpress.com/2008/03 â€¦ 0/#more-21</a>.</p><p>HTH,<br />Tom</p>									</div>
