					<p>Hello.</p><p>I&#039;m writing this story out of frustration over today&#039;s events.</p><p>I live in finland and we have quite large OpenSpark community. So i decided to join in, because i just bought new laptop that is somewhat portable. There&#039;s this firm (sparknet.fi) that offers these boxes pre-configured with OpenWrt-based OpenSpark firmware for 95â‚¬+postage. I was already going to buy mine straight from them to avoid possibility of bricking. Well... Price is kinda much for 30-50â‚¬ piece of hardware, and they only accepted credit card as payment option. So i went and bought mine from local radioshack-clone for 30â‚¬.</p><p>Today i came home and started to flash this buffalo station. First 30 tries were in vein because of this unbelievably stupid boot-wait feature. I followed instructions as closely as possible and finally it paid up.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://mirosol.kapsi.fi/varasto/howvistabrickedmyHWRG54.jpg" alt="http://mirosol.kapsi.fi/varasto/howvistabrickedmyHWRG54.jpg" /></span></p><p>And what a fine job! Well spent 30â‚¬!</p><p>Vista&#039;s tftp just decided to copy 1% of this new firmware over the original one. So, now i have pretty expensive 3.3v power adapter and lan-cable. Thank you microsoft. They&#039;ll be receiving some &quot;happy&quot; customer feedback soon...</p><p>Just thought that i share this with you. So that you can use appropriate OS for your flashing. I can promise that i&#039;m never doing that from M$ OS again.</p><p>Happy surfing everyone!</p>									</div>

					<p>Are you sure it&#039;s completely bricked? I accidentally TFTPed in ASCII mode once. The router, as you would expect, wouldn&#039;t boot. It still responded to pings at 192.168.11.1, however, and I was able to TFTP the firmware correctly and recover the router.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m using Vista (well, actually win 2008 server, but it&#039;s the same core) and never had any problems with tftp. Once I&#039;ve tftped wrong firmware, the router didn&#039;t boot but I was able to tftp another firmware.</p>									</div>
