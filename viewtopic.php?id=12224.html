					<p>V. slow internet connection.</p><p>I seem to have a major problem, first my specs, then what happened.</p><p>ASUS WL-500g Premium Wireless Router<br />Firmware Version WHITE RUSSIAN (RC5)<br />Kernel Version Linux version 2.4.30 (nbd@ux-2y02) (gcc version 3.4.4 (OpenWrt-1.0)) #1 Sun Mar 26 19:02:04 CEST 2006<br />PC: Win 2000 Pro (fully up-to-date)</p><p>Yesterday my internet connection, for no apparent reason, started running very slowly, approx. 65 bytes/sec.</p><p>Thinking the problem was at my cable provider&#039;s end (not ISDN, UK Virgin Media - was Blue Yonder before Virgin bought them) I called them up.</p><p>Tech support said there were no problems in my area, and refused to even check until I&#039;d followed through their question list -typical (India based &#039;tech support&#039; phone service).</p><p>I had to connect my PC directly via RJ45 to the cable modem, switch my IP/DNS to &#039;get automatically&#039;, reboot everything, and hey presto, no internet connection at all - Windows now automatically assigns my IP address as one that looks like a local LAN connection: 192.168.1.100. After ipconfig /release /renew /flushdns etc. no change !! Ah, they say, there&#039;s something wrong with your OS, reinstall it. --Their technical knowledge is less than a 12 year old kid I know.</p><p>So I re-connected the cables back to my router and then the router also gave me a local IP address, this time 192.168.1.10 as the IP vlan1 connects to (which should be the IP of my cable provider) as shown in the connection status of OpenWRT Admin Console (web page connection to router). [Obviously I&#039;d already changed my PC&#039;s IP and DNS back to what they should be to connect to the router.]</p><p>Not able to access OpenWRT docs on the web, and reboots having failed to resolve the situation, I decided to re-enter my nvram settings and reboot. No change. Then I had to go out for the rest of the day.</p><p>This morning, having left everything powered down over night, I&#039;m back to square one. An IP address through my router but getting 65 bytes/sec. I tested directly connecting to my PC again, and got the same &#039;local address&#039; given to me instead of a real live working IP, yes I made sure all the settings were correct, and released, renewed, flushed DNS, etc., no change.</p><p>Back to the router and I&#039;m still getting the mega slow connection, instead of my 10 mega bits/per sec. It&#039;s taken 30 mins just to get this forum loaded to post this message. As a result of this please CC replies to me by email, as it is so much quicker downloading a text email than viewing web pages, which often need multiple re-tries before I can eventually view a page.</p><p>Email is, and I know this is not the right etiquette but given my situation can an exception be made? jmstanfield@googlemail.com</p><p>Please advise steps I should take to resolve this problem.</p><p>Many, many, thanks,</p><p>mattstan</p>									</div>
