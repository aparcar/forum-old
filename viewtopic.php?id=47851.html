					<p>Hi people. My WRT messed up randomly (i don&#039;t know why) so i had to reinstall it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>So, i&#039;ve got a problem with Internet connections from the router. It was running f..... awesome before it crashed, and now, with the system reinstalled, connection is always cutting... sometimes when i&#039;m luck i can be more than 1 hour without a cut, but now my connection is getting cutted each 3 minutes... is really annoying because online services disconnect, i can&#039;t play online, mine bitcoins.... all those last things from computer: i connect some computers and devices to the WRT router too, and they show cuts. But WRT also: i was looking to a ping and was really messed up: 10ms, 50ms, 1420ms, 100ms, 150ms, 12ms, unrecheable, unrecheable, unrecheable, 24ms, 522ms... like this.</p><p>I modified basic values from the INTERFACES option on luci, just the private IP. I have another WRT router running ok (this one fails is an AR5387un, another one, HG556a). I compared HG556a Interfaces config with the config i setted up on 5387 and are the same (except router ip, of course)</p><p>So, i dont know what&#039;s going wrong <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>PD: this router is using &quot;LuCI Trunk (svn-r9915) OpenWrt Barrier Breaker r38342 &quot;.<br />Just same firmware as i used before, that was working great.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>noentiendero</strong> on 15 Dec 2013, 02:07)</p>
