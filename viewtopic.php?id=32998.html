					<p>Multiple network with the same MAC is no problem. Same MAC in the same network is a problem. Multiple brands of professional network equipment make use of this, because registring the vendor part of the MAC address cost money (although not all vendors register their MACs). </p><p>You&#039;ll find that most of the time, when you configure a trunk, you&#039;ll see the same MAC address configured on all layer3 interfaces.</p><p>Although its interesting to know where this MAC comes from, it should not give a problem. Unless of course you connect two of those routers.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Adze</strong> on 24 Nov 2011, 20:16)</p>

					<p>Yes, that&#039;s a workaround. But if you did what I asked, it could help others in the future, i.e. openwrt could use correct MACs from the start.</p>									</div>
