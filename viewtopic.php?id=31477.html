					<p>Hi again samcrawford,</p><p>I have seen you have given some format to the info I added in the wiki, nice <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>After reading what you posted in the wiki about upgrading I doubt about which would be the right image to use when upgrading.&nbsp; ¿should I use &quot;openwrt-x86-generic-combined-ext2.img&quot; or &quot;openwrt-x86-generic-rootfs-ext2.img&quot;? I think the &quot;combined&quot; image contains the kernel and the &quot;rootfs&quot; image doesn´t contain the kernel so I think the right one should be the &quot;combined&quot; one, but not totally sure.</p><p>could you confirm which is the right one to use for upgrade? I want to be sure when upgrading and also want to specify it in the wiki.</p><p>many thanks for your help</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>esplinter</strong> on 24 Aug 2011, 00:41)</p>
