					<p>Hello,</p><p>I was running &quot;openwrt-ar71xx-tl-wr1043nd-v1-squashfs-factory&quot; (rc4), and was having trouble with the UI.&nbsp; &nbsp; So I thought I&#039;d try a newer version.&nbsp; (Based on the openwrt homepage post about the trunk being very stable.)</p><p>I tried to flash with &quot;openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr1043nd-v1-squashfs-sysupgrade&quot; (trunk) via the web interface.&nbsp; &nbsp; The&nbsp; router did stuff, but rebooted to just the &quot;power&quot; light on.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>After some time (10 minutes), I tried power cycling the router, and the lights flash for a second or two, but again just settle down to only the &quot;power&quot; light being on.&nbsp; The LAN/WAN leds do light up depending on if a cable is plugged in.</p><p>Clicking or holding the &quot;QSS&quot; button on power up does not change anything.&nbsp; (The SYS led never starts to blink.)</p><p>Did I just kill my $65 router?&nbsp; Is it fixable without soldering in a new flash chip?</p><p>Thank you</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>OoJoo</strong> on 15 Jun 2011, 06:06)</p>

					<p>The message about trunk being stable is a few months old I think and the builds were broken for a while lately as well when they switched to 2.6.37.<br />Last time I did a sysupgrade through the webinterface I was not able to connect at all by telnet/ssh, only using LuCI. I upgraded using sysupgrade -n to reset all config, but nothing was true less, almost all files were still there, telnet was disabled, etc.<br />Does the SYS never blink at all? or just not starting to blink faster if you press the QSS button during boot?<br />Which things have you tried from the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd#debricking">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl- â€¦ debricking</a> page?</p>									</div>

					<p>I had a similar experience with my wr1043nd a week ago. In the end resorted to soldering in the serial head, buying a TTL serial to USB cable and reflashing using serial console and TFTP server.</p><p>Andre</p>									</div>

					<p>The next build (r27153) after the problematic one was OK. I flashed it and it&#039;s working. There is an issue I reported in <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/9561">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/9561</a> , but it&#039;s been there for a while and not related to your problem.</p><p>My symptoms were very similar: I flashed the router and after rebooting it would only blink once with all the LEDs and then only the power would remain on and that&#039;s it.</p><p>I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LC54ZY">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LC54ZY</a> . Had to reshuffle the pins in the connector to match the ones on the board though.</p><p>I don&#039;t believe the bootloader could be affected in your case, so you can try the serial console.</p><p>Andre</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>AndreZ</strong> on 16 Jun 2011, 15:20)</p>
