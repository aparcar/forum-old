And I have no real idea how it works...</p></blockquote></div><p>Hi abnoeh,</p><p>Good work! I booted it and it runs. Congratulations! ;-)</p><p>I post here some comments:</p><p>- How to boot the INITRAMFS firmware?<br />&nbsp; 1) Boot your device using the SERIAL connection, and stop the U-boot with key &#039;4&#039;.<br />&nbsp; 2) Copy the firmware-initramfs to one TFTP server running in address 192.168.0.100.<br />&nbsp; 3) Type in the U-boot console: &quot;tftpboot 0x82000000 openwrt-ramips-mt7620-ArcherC2-initramfs-kernel.bin&quot;<br />&nbsp; 4) After END the TFTP download, type &quot;boot.m 0x82000000&quot;<br />&nbsp; Voil√†! Your OpenWRT will boot in your device WITHOUT CHANGING ANYTHING IN THE FLASH.</p><p>- After booting OpenWRT I recommend to do a backup of your STOCK firmware:<br />&nbsp; 1) Connect using SSH to your device (change the IP using the SERIAL connection if you need it).<br />&nbsp; 2) Execute:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # mkdir /tmp/backup<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # cat /proc/mtd &gt; /tmp/backup/mtd.txt<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # dd if=/dev/mtd0ro of=/tmp/backup/mtd0ro.u-boot<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # dd if=/dev/mtd1ro of=/tmp/backup/mtd1ro.firmware<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # dd if=/dev/mtd2ro of=/tmp/backup/mtd2ro.kernel<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # dd if=/dev/mtd3ro of=/tmp/backup/mtd3ro.rootfs<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # dd if=/dev/mtd4ro of=/tmp/backup/mtd4ro.rootfs_data<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # dd if=/dev/mtd5ro of=/tmp/backup/mtd5ro.config<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # dd if=/dev/mtd6ro of=/tmp/backup/mtd6ro.rom<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # dd if=/dev/mtd7ro of=/tmp/backup/mtd7ro.romfile<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # dd if=/dev/mtd8ro of=/tmp/backup/mtd8ro.radio<br />&nbsp; 3) Using the SCP command copy these files to your computer and save them in a safe location.</p><p>- More or less, all seems to work with this firmware... except:<br />&nbsp; 1) The 5GHz radio seems to have troubles.<br />&nbsp; 2) In the booting process I see some problems. DMESG shows:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;Omitted&gt;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Two main things worry me:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A) The mismatch of the SPI FLASH! My is &quot;mx25l6405d&quot; instead of &quot;s25fl064k&quot; described in the Wiki.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I hope this doesn&#039;t creates troubles when flashing, but I&#039;m not sure. My device is &quot;v1-EU&quot;. Please, update the Wiki.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;B) The errors with the 5GHz MT7610 radio driver.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I feel the driver needs to be improved or updated for solve the problems. Any idea?</p><p>- Changes proposed in the &quot;.config&quot; for improving the development (in the sense of helping to fix the firmware):<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;# CONFIG_PACKAGE_kmod-block2mtd:&nbsp; enable for mounting flash partitions (see wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/block_mount)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;# CONFIG_PACKAGE_kmod-fs-squashfs: enable for accessing to the squash partition in the flash<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;# CONFIG_PACKAGE_kmod-mtd-rw: enable for write access of the flash using MTD tools (useful for writing the firmware section in MTD1 [mtd2+mtd3] without touching the rest)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;# CONFIG_PACKAGE_kmod-mtdtests: enable for testing/checking the flash structure<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;# CONFIG_RT_CFG80211: I&#039;m not sure, but this is not required to be enabled for controlling the radio using standard tools?</p><p>I hope soon you can generate a PR for merge with the mainstream.<br />Regards.</p></blockquote></div><p>I already flashed it and it works. (I don&#039;t have serial cable for it or spi clip so I&#039;m playing russian roulette <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" />) and they works on my C2 (V1,KR version). <br />and I can&#039;t fix 5G wifi driver because this uses binary driver so we can&#039;t touch it. (well not they I know C well enought to patch a driver even if it&#039;s a open source driver)</p><p>P.S I port @zaccaria &#039;s commits to newest lede 17.01 build repo(not trunk) with git cherry-picking.<br />github.com/orangepizza/openwrt-archer-c2-lede17.01 (use lede 17.01 branch) <br />&lt;back up your setting before flashing this&gt;<br />builded image: github.com/orangepizza/openwrt-archer-c2-lede17.01/releases/tag/archer-c2<br />+ it has newer kernel 4.4.14 -&gt; 4.4.120<br />+ it now can be compiled on a 64bit linux<br />- somewhy it won&#039;t keep your setting on flash, but importing backuped setting will work.<br />I already finished to compile a image and flashed it on my C2, and it boots and I&#039;m using it right now<br />about: flash mismatch..

I have a serial cable and opened the case of C2). So, please request to @zaccaria to generate also the INITRAMFS version.</p><p>Regarding the flash mismatch I suggest to update the code. I feel the official merge will requires that this be fixed. My suggestion is to support both types already indentified.</p><p>Please, remember to add my suggestions about the &quot;.config&quot;. Without it will be more difficult to help you for testing. The main idea is: if we boot using the initramfs version, then we can flash anything in the MTD; even recover to the stock version. So, we really need one version with full MTD write support and INITRAMFS enabled.</p><p>And finally, about the 5GHz driver. At ime it only exists a binary version?</p><p>Regards.</p>									</div>

But your compilation is missing! Not found: h*t*t*p*:*/*/*abnoeh.eu.org/filestore/lede-c2-debug-march-20-03.tar.xz</p><p>Let me to explain why and what...</p><p>- Until we can merge the port with the official repository we&#039;re doing <strong>testing and developement</strong>.<br />- During this phase is <strong>required</strong> that we can start/check/flash/reflash/etc the firmware without bricking devices.<br />- Futhermore, is <strong>mandatory</strong> to have a failsave firmware for recovery in case of necessity.<br />- Then the most <em>simple</em> solution is: 1) Enable access to the Bootloader through the device&#039;s physical serial port. 2) Use bootable kernels from the Bootlader without flashing the firmware. 3) Enable the option for flashing <em>any</em> kernel in the flash using a <em>running</em> firmware. 4) Have the option for restoring a backup of the stock image to the flash using a firmware that can boot from the bootloader.<br />- <span class="bbu">All of these four points are required for a safe development</span>.</p><p>So, at time, we need to compile <strong>all</strong> firmwares in INITRAMFS <em>and</em> SQUASHFS forms. The first for booting from the Bootloader; the second for testing the boot from the flash. However, is still <strong>mandatory</strong> that all images have <span class="bbu">full MTD access enabled</span> (r/w). That is for flashing squash images or restore the stock firmware.</p><p>The problem is that now you only provide tools for flashing using the U-Boot restore method. And this can brick your device... Why? Because if you overwrite the bootloader, or overwrite the radio partition, then you can lose important data. The best method <strong>during the develpment</strong> is flash only using mtd tools. So, you can safe flash what you really like.</p><p>So, please complete all your compilations with MTD TOOLS and INITRAMFS. And provide all images in the release section of the Github. This will speedup the development.</p><p>Regards.</p>									</div>
