					<p>Hello guys. I have my tp-link mr3040 &quot;bricked&quot;. Now the story..&nbsp; I was playing with some 3g settings and linux commands. It almost perfectly works on openwrt fw, when i accidently removed the main folder in root .. i dont remember the exact name of it, but i think it was /etc folder. Now i have such result - my PC on win 8.1 can see unrecognized network connection after a long identification process. Router does not have any infinite reboot, as i&#039;ve read on many forums of common problems... but it doesn&#039;t have any reaction at all. It&#039;s just a one single light indicates the power on. No reaction on switcher and lan cable plugged in, no reaction on short or long reset. I have been searching the information about my issue on the web a lot, and did not find anything precise... maybe it&#039;s cuz i am quite a newbie in this quiestion. I&#039;ve seen many pages of how to recover using serial port or smth, but a have one question: Do i have a chance to recover my mr3040 using lan connection? cuz i&#039;ve heard that if PC can see smth - it&#039;s not the end of lan story... and the booter might be OK. I dont actually understand the organization of router&#039;s system, therefore i don&#039;t know what to do.&nbsp; So i hope you can help me with that.</p>									</div>

					<p>man, i did all the instructions here:</p><p>Failsafe Mode<br />Switch on the router<br />Wait almost 5 sec<br />Press the &quot;Reset&quot; for ~3sec<br />The device is now in Failsafe-Mode<br />You may access it by using telnet 192.168.1.1/24 or serial<br />Keep in mind: The LEDs won&#039;t flash in Failsafe Mode!</p><p>but nothing changed. btw there&#039;re no any info of what to use, and how exactly, and what is 192.168.1.1/24, is that a port&nbsp; 24? are there any special network configs, static IP or smth? i&#039;ve tried all variations in putty, 192.168.1.1 with port 24 via telnet, and 192.168.1.1 by default and 192.168.1.1/24 in one line, but it always an error, or the putty is just closing up. i dont know is the failsafe mode active on my router, i&#039;ve tried it many times and waited less or more 5 and 3 seconds in both cases with power and reset!</p><p>there is an example on other model, but that guy has LEDs work well, and in my case no flashes at all, just when i switch it on they all lights up with green, and than only power always lights<br /> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axQvgqvlhcU&amp;feature=youtu.be">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axQvgqvl … e=youtu.be</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eugenekoiner</strong> on 13 Oct 2014, 19:27)</p>
