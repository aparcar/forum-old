					<p>I was looking for a secure firmware for my device that is updated only when there are major bugfixes or security issues. In AA12.09 there are at least several security issues in dropbear. So an update would be convenient; mabe as a beta version to AA12.09.1.<br />Keeping track of security issues of all packages to build a new version is inconvenient for the enduser (and for me) and daily flashing of BB trunk poses an elevated risk of bricking the device.<br />Would it be possible to annouce somewhere when there is an securtiy issue? Thus one would know, when to build and flash a new version.<br />For me, OpenWRT is nicely configurable also via LuCI, so I don&#039;t want to switch to e.g. Gargoyle. But it seems, that they offer updates. Maybe I&#039;ll give it a try.</p><p>Thanks for the reply and for the nice work done so far for OpenWRT.</p>									</div>
