					<p>It would be nice if this feature was included in LuCi, but as of this post it is not.</p><p>For those who would like to use their WNDR3700v2 in place of the Actiontec router, you will have to give a VID 35 (for Bell/Aliant) on the WAN Port. Currently this feature is not available in the web interface, however it is still possible by modifying the configuration file in the router itself.</p><p>Using PuTTy, connect to the router. (Default 192.168.1.1)</p><p>login using root and use the password you set in the web interface.<br />issue the command: vi /etc/config/network<br />Scroll down with the cursor keys until you see the following:</p><p>config interface &#039;wan&#039;</p><p>you will want to add the line, option ifname &#039;eth1.35&#039; and option macaddr &#039;xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx&#039; where xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx is the mac address of the actiontec router which can be obtained by looking on the underside of it under WAN MAC.</p><p>as an example, my configuration looks like this:</p><p>config interface &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option proto &#039;dhcp&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option _orig_ifname &#039;eth1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option _orig_bridge &#039;false&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option ifname &#039;eth1.35&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option macaddr &#039;11:22:33:44:55:66&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option hostname &#039;R1000H-Router&#039;</p><p>remove the actiontec from the ONT and replace with the wndr3700v2. Reboot the router if not already done so, and you should have internet access now.</p>									</div>
