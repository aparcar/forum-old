					<p>Hello guys,</p><p>I&#039;m using OpenWRT as a platform for building a media streaming application (which will hopefully be released OS by March ...). But since the app is driving my Asus Router to its resource limits, I would like to run an alternative disk scheduler to overcome certain problems. The anticipatory disk scheduler introduced in Linux 2.5 would be a feasible solution.</p><p>How could this be done? For the last 15 minutes I have been trying to find a backport to Linux 2.4 on the net, but I have not been successful with that yet. The other way would be to run Linux 2.6 on the router. I see that there have been attempts to do this, but exactly what is the status of this?</p><p>I am willing to investigate further into this issue and contribute, whatever I am allowed to, back to your project. However, I cannot make any promises since for the time being, I am working in a corporate environment and I do not own the source code I am writing.</p><p>Anyway, I would definitely appreciate any help, be it just a few pointers of where to start.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Johannes Ball√©</p>									</div>
