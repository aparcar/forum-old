					<p>Hello,<br />just a quick question about development.<br />They told me that a big part of adm5120 code is being rewriting to enlarge the support of some devices (e.g. Compex WP54) which are currently forked from OpenWrt project. If I well understood, perhaps this support will be possible on next 7.07.<br />Just for information, I would like if what I said it&#039;s true, and in which date approximately you are planning to complete 7.07.<br />Thank you.</p>									</div>
