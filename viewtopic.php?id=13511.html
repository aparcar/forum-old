					<p>Let me rephrase my question - <br />Anyone have experience with Atheros 5312 WiSoC which contains one 5112 and one 2112 rf unit.<br />I have found one thread on here that discusses problems with a related device and says that this unit only has 11a on the first wireless device and b/g on second, which, according to <a href="http://www.atheros.com/pt/bulletins/AR5002AP-2X.pdf">http://www.atheros.com/pt/bulletins/AR5002AP-2X.pdf</a> (Atheros documentation on this device), is not true. They say that the AR5112 (the first wireless device of 5312 chipset) supports frequencies 2.3-2.5 and 4.9-5.8 and AR2112 (the b/g unit) 2.3-2.5. This chipset is a dual-radio setup, not a single a/b/g that has somehow been made visible through madwifi as two separate devices.</p>									</div>
