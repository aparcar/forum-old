					<p>I compiled the latest svn snapshot of kamikaze.&nbsp; I loaded it on a buffalo WHR-G54S and it will load the driver, but it does not detect the right chipset.&nbsp; It has a broadcom 4318 which the website for b43 says that it supports it.&nbsp; I can get the wifi interface up.&nbsp; The wierd thing is that it will set my router into bridge mode (the bridge light is on in the front).&nbsp; I use dmesg to look at what it is detecting and its showing WLAN 0000 found.&nbsp; Anyone else having this problem or know how to fix it?</p>									</div>

					<p>After looking at the b43 website, this problem maybe due to the fact that with b43 and 2.6.24 kernel you are supposed to use firmware from broadcom-wl-4.80.53.0.&nbsp; With b43 and 2.6.25 or newer you are supposed to use firmware from broadcom-wl-4.150.10.5.&nbsp; Possibly this could be the problem?&nbsp; I think the brcm47xx target is only using 2.6.23 kernel.</p>									</div>
