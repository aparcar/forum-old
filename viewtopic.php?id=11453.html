					<p>I&#039;ve just moved to openWRT from DD-WRT and i love it! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>I have had a minor issue however, with testing of pptp it is creating a lock file. However, on a fresh install/boot it complains that it cant create a lock file in /var/lock. I mkdir this directory and all is well, im just wondering if im missing something as surely this should be made in the init scripts?</p><p>I am running latest version of whiterussion, feb 2007.</p><p>thanks guys,</p><p>chris</p>									</div>
