In fact, if I give it a value below 200 when the fan is stopped, it won&#039;t even start. If I spin the fan down from 200 to 150, there is a loud grinding sound. My fan isn&#039;t much quieter as 200 than it is at 255, just a lower pitch, but I see that people are having success with values like 150 and report that it is quiet (I assume the fan is actually spinning up at that value).</p><p>To address this, I bought two 40mm x 10mm fans: a Sunon quiet ballbearing fan that uses the same 0.8W power as the stock fan (might even be the same model), and a Sunon high-rpm fan that operates at 0.96W. When I opened up my router, though, it appears that the fan has been attached with screws from the underside of the heat sink. I tried removing all the screws on the heat sink, but I couldn&#039;t remove it, it wouldn&#039;t budge. Has anyone removed their heatsink? Is it just stuck because of thermal grease/glue? Do I need to remove the smaller, shiny heatsink first before removing the larger one?</p><p>Does anyone know how I can remove the existing fan? There doesn&#039;t seem to be a good place to mount a fan other than where the old one is, but trying to pry it off didn&#039;t work. Should I just attack the old fan with a Dremel tool?</p></blockquote></div><br /><p>The bolts of the fan are on the other side. To remove them you have to remove the heat sinks. They are glued to the components below with heat conducting tape. You have to be very careful and start with the heat sink on the wifi card. I used a flat screwdriver and gently removed it. Then you have to remove the second heat sink the same way starting from the other side (the side that is opposite to the WiFi card). I replaced the fan with 50x50x10mm. I&nbsp; made some cuts in the sink to remove some of the ribs. I used a bigger fan, because it is a lot quieter and has a lot more CFM.</p><p>Good luck.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>i.trankolov</strong> on 13 Oct 2015, 09:42)</p>

					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>I&#039;ve bought a wrt1900AC-V2 about 2 weeks ago and installed CC-final on it. It&#039;s currently my main internet router.</p><p>My home internet connection is a FTTH connection, symmetrical 100-100mbit, pppoe based. But the provider does not cap the upload speeds.<br />Currently i&#039;m puzzling with the fact that after one or two days of uptime, the downloadspeeds (via wifi!) drops to about 20mbit, while upload stays &quot;limitless&quot; (&gt;250mbit/sec)<br />Changing from wl0 to wl1 does not have any effect, performance stays bad until i reboot the device. it seems that the issue is wifi related, but due to a lack of wired laptops, i can&#039;t check the performance via the lan ports.</p><p>Anyone have any tips to debug and fix this issue?</p><p>[edit] just did some wgets on the router of larger bin files &gt;/dev/zero and download from the internet is indeed still ~100mbit, confirming my idea the issue is wifi related.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>JohnnySL</strong> on 15 Oct 2015, 00:16)</p>
