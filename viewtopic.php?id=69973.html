					<p>I am looking for a new router to replace the one I got from my ISP as the Wifi coverage and speed is not great.</p><p>ISP: Hyperoptic<br />Speed: 1Gbps dl/ul<br />Current Router: ZTE ZXHN H298N</p><p>The connection comes straight into my apartment via an ethernet cable, so no need for a modem. I do a lot of gaming so low latency would be great. I also have a plex server and subsonic server that can be accessed from outside my network. I have been told that it would be more secure to have these behind a VPN, so VPN would be useful feature. I use my PC as network storage so no need for high speed USB ports. I would like to be able to manage and limit traffic to individual devices (Qos?). Wifi coverage and speed must be good, but coverage is more important than speed. I would prefer AC capabilities. Budget is £100 to £150.</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>									</div>

					<p>Openvpn and gigabit NAT are completely different things. The WRT series does gigabit NAT with ease. Most x86 hardware isn&#039;t capable of gigabit vpn either.</p>									</div>

					<p>riskywhat,</p><p>35Mbit is quite respectable for an embedded cpu; me thinks stangri isn&#039;t using the available crypto hardware here. 1Gbit VPN is definitely enterprise level and is usually a dedicated hardware appliance somewhere behind the firewall.</p><p>Wireguard is an alternative you could look into.</p>									</div>

					<p>35Mbit is roughly what I&#039;d expect if the encryption is done in software (using the cpus). There are two crypto modules (CESA) on that board that could be leveraged. What to expect when doing so I have to little experience though as to make a guess but a noticeable boost should be possible.</p>									</div>
