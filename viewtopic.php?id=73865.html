					<p>Hey all,</p><p>My current modem and router and pieces of junk. On Sunday I&#039;ll be getting a higher end modem and higher end router. I want to make sure I set these things up correctly.</p><p>I&#039;m first obviously going to unplug my current modem and router.</p><p>After that, I will hook up my new modem. After I hook up the new modem, do I call my cable provider to activate it, or do I also connect the router before calling them?</p><p>I thought I had heard somewhere it is bad to hook up the router to a new modem that has not yet been activated by the cable company. Can someone just list the appropriate steps to doing this?</p><p>If it helps, my new modem is a <a href="https://shop.optiwella.com/modem/sagemcom-fst-3686-ac-docsis-30-wireless-gateway">https://shop.optiwella.com/modem/sagemc â€¦ ss-gateway</a>, and my new router is a TP-LINK AC1900.</p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>The TP-LINK AC1900 is not supported by OpenWrt and probably never will be (broadcom softmac wlan).</p><p>Once the modem is in bridge mode (as it should be), the ISP only sees and uses your router&#039;s MAC address on the wire - and uses it for authentification. So you do want to switch both at the same time (if you&#039;d like to avoid hacks like MAC cloning et al).</p>									</div>
