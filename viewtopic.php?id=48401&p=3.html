					<p>Hi everyone, I&#039;ve managed to brick the device! No wireless, just the bridge led. So I popped it open to try and fix it, and there seems to be quite some room for modding as well. My main question is how to flash the firmware through serial. Has anyone done it? Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>So I would either use option 2 or 7, right? I have an ethernet cable soldered straight to the pads, which is not ideal but should work. Can I use serva or do I have to stick to Linux? Also, would option 7 work, and if yes, how do I set things up? I know, I could just search all that stuff, but I really need the NAS up and running again. And that&#039;s just the beginning, so thank you all in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>Got it working again! all it needed was a wireless config regeneration. <br />so, here comes the tricky part, how do we access the nas from outside the repeater network? meaning that there&#039;s a master network and a client one and you have access to everything from the master network, but not from the client. bridging them doesn&#039;t do much.<br />also, how do we get the Ethernet port to work? eth0.1 is a vlan, but why is it necessary?</p>									</div>

					<p>This is not as easy.&nbsp; I assume the request is to access the LAN of your MLW221 from the LAN of the &quot;AP&quot;.&nbsp; The AP(STAtion) is on a different subnet and coming in the WAN, so to speak, is, as you say, hitting the firewall.&nbsp; So the basic answer is no by design.&nbsp; The device is working as a &quot;Router&quot; and separating your local traffic from the outside world.</p><p>If you convert the device to work as a &quot;Dumb AP&quot; of sorts then this is possible, but it is not something you want to take into the outside world.&nbsp; It&#039;s not safe.&nbsp; There is a package called &quot;relayd&quot;, which will let you connect to your AP (STAtion) and be on the the same SUBNET as the rest of your devices (wireless on both sides).&nbsp; I used it briefly, on another RAMPIS and it works.&nbsp; It&#039;s a bit odd to configure.&nbsp; Search the wiki and read, read, read.&nbsp; </p><p>If you wish to go down this road, I will suggest you make a backup of your working &quot;Router&quot; config and do the same when you get a &quot;relayd&quot; config working.&nbsp; Then you can just load one up and reboot for your needs.&nbsp; If you search the forum and wiki I think you will find some have authored scripts to do this.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you, RangerZ. Pardon, I might have misled you. We don&#039;t have a router scenario in mind, but a portable music server. The standard use case would be for the device&nbsp; to sign on to our wifi network and share music with other wifi clients on that LAN. Only if the device does not have access to our wifi network, e.g. on the road, the device&#039;s own wifi would be used to let other clients connect to it and access the device.</p><p>So essentially, it&#039;s great that we now have the device act simultaneously as both wifi client <em>and</em> access point. All we&#039;d need is the ability for it to expose its samba and http ports to both sides -- no routing or traversal of data required. Shouldn&#039;t there be a smart solution in openWRT for this seemingly simple scenario?</p>									</div>

					<p>I am still not sure I am following you.&nbsp; The MLW221 is the music server.&nbsp; You want users to be able to connect to it&#039;s internal AP on the WLAN, which generally&nbsp; means they have no internet access while they are connected, unless the client has multiple interfaces (like a laptop might, but not most other devices).&nbsp; </p><p>You also want the MLW221 to be come part of the LAN as a client (like another PC on the network) so that other LAN clients can also stream from it.&nbsp; If you can accept the IP coming THROUGH the MLW221 from the main LAN then relayd might work.&nbsp; Just not sure how transportable the device is to other LANS (ie different subnets) with out reconfiguration. </p><p>If you want the MLW221 to act as a DHCP for those connected to it&#039;s AP, then you need a traditional router.&nbsp; The only way I can think that you could also come in the other way would be to modify (heavily) or possible disable the firewall.&nbsp; Not in my skill set.</p><p>It&#039;s not as simple as you would like to think it is.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have a little problem. After I flashed the mlw221 with lede I tried to switch back to openwrt. Now the mlw221 isn&#039;t booting into openwrt and via serial I get this message:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>3: System Boot system code via Flash.

So my question is, can sombody give me the right values? The firmware file I have has this size (according to windows) 9,50 MB (9.961.528 Bytes) It&#039;s from this package <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0CKglNyN0URdHJqZ25rczhZc00/">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0CKgl … 5rczhZc00/</a></p><p>Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rj-45</strong> on 5 May 2017, 10:50)</p>
