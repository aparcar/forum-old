					<p>The package installation system is sometimes picky in noticing new packages from feeds, especially is the packages has already been present in another feed (and has been &quot;installed&quot; from there).</p><p>There might e.g. be a leftover symlink in ./package/feeds/packages to the old location (the attempt to have it in the packages feeds dir). Check for that. Menuconfig might find that empty link first and then not look for your new oscam feed at all. Those symlinks in package/feeds are sneaky.</p><p>You might also try to create the downloaded feeds from scratch. (delete all from ./package/feeds and ./feeds )</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 27 Aug 2016, 15:12)</p>
