					<p>I would also like to know how to do automatic e2fsck. Sometimes my Asus WL-500gP V2 unmounts the filesystem and remounts as read-only, and can&#039;t mount as writable until I manually do e2fsck and confirm every problem with y. Would be nice if it could do e2fsck and fix the problems automatically and then prefereably remount the filesystem as writable. It is also ok if it does the repairing at bootup.</p>									</div>
