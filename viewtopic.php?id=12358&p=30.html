How to add this correctly to the trunk?
Are files from /trunk/package/base-files and
/trunk/target/linux/orion/base-files merged?
Or should I use /trunk/target/linux/orion/base-files/etc/uci-defaults?
Can this be added just for WRT350Nv2 only or will it be set for all
devices with Orion boards?</code></pre></div>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>maddes.b</strong> on 7 Apr 2010, 21:43)</p>

					<p>I think i got the USB LED figured out with hotplug. here&#039;s the patch for it to work: <a href="http://hosting.upexia.nl/wrt350n/160-wrt350nv2-usbled.patch">http://hosting.upexia.nl/wrt350n/160-wr … bled.patch</a></p><p>What it does basically is overwrite the default 10-usb hotplug.d rule and toggle the USB LED on the WRT350nv2 only for the port itself. It should also work with USB hubs, e.g. the LED has to stay on even if there&#039;s no device on the extra hub. I couldn&#039;t test this because i don&#039;t have such a hub currently.</p><p><strong>edit</strong><br />I thought of making the LED configurable like the other LEDS, but i figured 99% wants default behavior for this and the people who don&#039;t are free to make changes to the system anyway...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dirkNL</strong> on 9 Feb 2010, 19:01)</p>

					<p>No, it&#039;s just a normal ftp server with 2 connections per IP. FTp setup has not changed since 2 years.<br />Just tested and I could download big files from a customer network.<br />It can be a problem with your internet provider, the proxy you use, your network or just downloading more than 2 files at once from the ftp server.<br />Also try a browser or different ftp client.</p><p>Maddes</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>maddes.b</strong> on 12 Feb 2010, 17:10)</p>
