					<p>Hi All,</p><p>I hope someone here can help me out as I am literally stuck!</p><p>I am using a TP-Link Router (TL-WR1043ND) and I upgraded the router&#039;s OEM firmware with Attitude Adjustment 12.09 Beta version.</p><p>The router was working fine and I had been filtering access to the internet by creating entries under Traffic Rules (Network --&gt;&nbsp; Firewall --&gt; Traffic Rules). However, in recent times I have tried to create more traffic rules and can only go as far as creating a &quot;New Forward Rule&quot; and after clicking &quot;add and edit&quot; I am prompted with a response saying &quot;The CGI process did not produce any response&quot;. Funny enough, I am able to &#039;delete&#039; an existing traffic rule by clicking on &#039;delete; however when I click on &#039;edit&#039; the process seems to execute very slowly and after about 20 seconds I am prompted withe above mentioned error message.</p><p>In an effort to try and solve the problem I have upgraded the firmware from 12.09 Beta to the full stable 12.09 version but I am still getting the same error message.</p><p>Does anyone know how to solve this error. In the meantime I am not able to create new traffic rules and thus can&#039;t add more computers to access the internet via the router and network.</p><p>I hope one of you would have come across the same problem and would be kind enough to let me know of a solution.</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p>									</div>
