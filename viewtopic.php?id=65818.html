					<p>I have been having a similar issue to your being unable to run the new DLNA. If I install a program not part of the squash FS, it won&#039;t run. This may help you, or not, but I thought perhaps you may want to know.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rdragonrydr</strong> on 30 Jun 2016, 15:09)</p>

Also, how do you know the kernel isn&#039;t using memory for cache which can deplete your free memory? I haven&#039;t noticed any memory leakage with minidlna 1.1.4.</p>									</div>
