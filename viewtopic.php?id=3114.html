					<p>My english is very week, but I hope I could help someone with this.</p><p>In the last month I tried a very long time with wpa_supplicant and xsupplicant to use a WRT as supplicant on the WLAN.<br />I use EAP-PEAP for authentifiaction.</p><p>The first I tried was WPA, but that is&#039;nt working cause Broadcom has WPA-PSK Code included in the driver (I read that in this forum),<br />with makes that incompatible.</p><p>Then xsupplicant worked for me but there a some points to keep in mind:</p><p>1. Use the xsupplicant and libssl package from NICO (<a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/people/nico/testing/mipsel/packages/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/people/nic â€¦ /packages/</a>)<br />2. as certificate-file from the Radius server take the root.pem (generatet with CA.certs from freeradius), the others will crash xsupplicant.<br />3. set the date on the WRT to a date that is valid for the certificate.&nbsp; i used date to do this.<br />4. make sure that the wrt-client is accociated to the AP, that means equal essid, sta-mode AND wep, even with a wrong key.<br />5. use whiterussian RC3, xsupplicant needs the fixes of the wlcompat package.<br />6. I was successfull with hardware version 2.0 and 2.2, but not with 3.1, I dont know why! (we have buyed 60 WRT version 3.1!!! f**k)<br />EDIT:&nbsp; Now its working on 3.1 too, it was my fault. (be sure that you have no br0)</p><br /><p>Here is my config:<br />* AP is a Openwrt Whiterussian RC3, nas with options:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;nas -P /tmp/nas.lan.pid -l br0 -H 34954 -i eth1 -A -m 32 -r $RADKEY -s $ESSID -w 1 -I 1 -K 12345 -h $RADIUSHOST -p 1812 -t 36000</p><p>* Freeradius 1.0.5<br />&nbsp; Activated peap in eap.conf<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>  eap {

					<p>I don&#039;t use xsupplicant so can&#039;t be of specific help, but re hw v3.1, are you erasing nvram after flashing openwrt? I&#039;ve found that most 3.1&#039;s (depending on shipped firmeware version) have a lot of extra nvram variables that clutter things up and might also be interfering.</p><p>- DL</p>									</div>
