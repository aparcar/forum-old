					<p>As arokh suggested, I took his latest source and built image for my TL-WDR4300 based on 3x00. As this router only has 8MB flash, I had to &quot;loose&quot; a few packages. I chose to remove tor, miniupnpd and unfs3. Also, the original image packs default hosts adblock list which makes image 130k larger. Since I spent a few days tuning different settings and reading through all the posts of this thread (yes really) I wanted to make a few suggestions for improvements.</p><p><strong>1. netlink: 11 bytes leftover after parsing attributes in process `ip&#039;.</strong><br />In my logs I noticed this message and found ticket created by a friend of this build @hnyman: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/20470">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/20470</a><br />I was able to make the message disappear by disabling building of IP applets (CONFIG_BUSYBOX_CONFIG_IP, CONFIG_BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_IP_*) in BusyBox which is anyway not needed since this build includes PACKAGE_ip required by SQM.</p><p>The ticket also discovered strange behaviour of <strong>$PATH</strong> variable changing from &quot;/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin&quot; to &quot;/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin&quot;, which might have much bigger impact on all startup/init scripts and is something you will need to consider in your builds.</p><p><strong>2. improved adblock.sh</strong><br />To further squeeze the build I removed the &quot;bad hosts&quot; list included in the build which shaved off 130k of data. As users need to be able to tune this file due to increasing use of anti-adblock scripts I think it is better to dynamically build the bad hosts list in the /tmp folder (where there is enough space). Below are the changes I made to arokh&#039;s adblock.sh script which combines downloading part from his build.sh and creates the file in /tmp/hosts folder instead. The /tmp/hosts folder is being automatically created and configured by /etc/init.d/dnsmasq. As an added bonus you can add a cron job to update this list at a desired frequency.</p><p>Drop-in replacement for: /usr/sbin/adblock.sh<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

Editing the hosts.bad file will move it to /overlay which would be impossible on routers with little place left.
