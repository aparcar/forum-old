					<p>Hi,</p><p>sorry for my bad english, but I didn&#039;t find any german community for openwrt.</p><p>I have running a TP-Link TL-WR1043N/ND v1 with OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 / LuCI 15.05-149-g0d8bbd2 Release (git-15.363.78009-956be55) as an Access Point behind a FritzBox 7490.</p><p>Mainly it&#039;s working as it should, but I found out, that some devices which are connected to openwrt via WLAN do not appear in the device list of the FritzBox.<br />It seems that this happens especially Android devices. Windows, Apple and other systems appear without problem.<br />It sees that the android devices get the same IP as another device connected to openwrt.</p><p>Directly connecting to FritzBox works fine and all devices appear in the device list.</p><p>Maybe anyone has an idea whats working wrong?</p>									</div>

					<p>Is &quot;port 1 of OpenWrt device&quot; a LAN port or the WAN port?
