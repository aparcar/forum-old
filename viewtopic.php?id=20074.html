					<p>Hi<br />I think it&#039;s easy to do with standard utilities such as netcat.<br />start a program that grabs serial port on WRT54G #1 and pipe the output to netcat<br />start netcat on WRT54G #2 and pipe the output to a program that outputs to the serial port</p><p>You might have to do this in each way if you want bidirectional communication.</p>									</div>
