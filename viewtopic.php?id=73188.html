					<p>Hello guys!!<br />New on the forums and coming from Gargoyle, still runnning on the old 1043ND, which is OpenWRT based.<br />The guy is doing as good as it can but I guess I want some more goodies (can&#039;t solve my troubles with transmission) and I&#039;m looking at other routers, so here they are:</p><p>This boy:<br />ZBT-WG3526</p><p>It should be already supported from OpenWRT, it runs some custom version and I saw a youtube video showing it is possible to upgrade with no trouble.<br />CPU is MT7621, can you confirm it has no troubles?<br />EDIT, FOUND ON THE WIKI, THIS ROUTER IS SUPPORTED!</p><p>This boy:<br />MTK MT7623A Network Process Platform&nbsp; U7623-06</p><p>Both these look like good hardware for money, other options include the Linsys WRT line.</p><p>Here&nbsp; things get tricky. It runs with the same CPU as the Banana Pi R2, MT7623 and it runs on custom version of android too, but I have no evidence I can just throw at it newer releases and I have found no answer so far.<br />Can you help me?</p><p>Argent</p>									</div>
