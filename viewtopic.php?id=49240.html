					<p>My situation is the following: I live in a flat-sharing community and my inmate thinks WLAN is bad for him. So he&#039;s turning it off as often as he can.</p><p>So I set up my wireless options to a hidden ssid since he isn&#039;t that into this stuff. However, his Windows 7 still discovers the hidden wlan as &quot;Other Network&quot; - after pulling out my LAN cable, which made the WLAN disappear, all excuses for my part got redundant.</p><p>Is there any way to make the access point completly invisible, at least to Windows?</p><p>I&#039;m using latest openwrt on my TP-Link TL-WA801ND v2.1.</p><p>Regards</p>									</div>

					<p>Using an (maybe illegal) US channel in Germany was the solution.</p><p>This hack (<a href="http://luci.subsignal.org/~jow/reghack/README.txt">http://luci.subsignal.org/~jow/reghack/README.txt</a>) allows the usage of channels 12 and 13 - windows won&#039;t scan those channels in Germany, with or without hidden ssid - it won&#039;t find the access point.</p><p>An android system for example still requires the hidden ssid. Not sure about iOS.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah but a lot of appliances seems to not recognize them, I&#039;m in Germany too and the Xbox 360 I brought here is unable to see any Ch 12 or 13 network either. Same for the Windows Laptop of my flatmate.</p>									</div>
