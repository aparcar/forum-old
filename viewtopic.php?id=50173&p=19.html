					<p>Hello all, I am new to this community (but not to open source or modding) but have jumped on the opportunity to snatch myself a new router and as you have guessed it is the wrt1900ac! I&#039;m currently running the stock firmware but coming from an asus rt-n56u with a custom firmware it lacks many features <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /> Now I understand that there are 2 prebuilt openwrt firmwares the first being AA and the second BB.

Slow enough I don&#039;t need to buy/lease a docsis 3 modem, fast enough I can play games/watch hd content with no lag.

Most people do not transfer files within their LAN very frequently(if at all.) The people that do may not benefit from 802.11ac enough to merit the cost. <br />I use netdrive on my laptop to allow streaming of content from my pc to my laptop.

I think even if they have the capability, the interoperability issues and lack of usefulness continue to make 802.11ac of little benefit to smartdevice users.
