					<p>I could not picture your setup. You have an AP and a client. <br />If then, which two APs you want them to talk to each other ?<br />Have you verified if rf connectivity is there and dhcp assigned ip addresses and etc ?</p>									</div>

					<p>i was testing connectivity of mikroti running as ap on 133c<br />config are <br />AP<br />133c<br />mode : ap bridge<br />wdis : dynamic</p><p>client :<br />wp54g<br />openwrt R12608<br />mode : sta<br />wds = 1<br />its back to back so no issues of connectivity jus less than 5mts apart.<br />there is connectivity but no pings. Clear issue of unsupported client bridging. Looks like wds is mikrotik is incompatible. Had anyone connected wrt station with mikrotik ap&nbsp; in bridging mode. I&nbsp; &nbsp;hope it clears the scenario<br />regards<br />norms</p>									</div>
