					<p>I&#039;ve been reading until my eyes are sore and I can&#039;t seem to find anything which clearly says how to simply configure openwrt to use the dns servers provided by the upstream dhcp server. </p><p>I cannot hard code my dns servers into the device because I use the device on different networks so need it to pick up the dns servers from the dhcp server. The openwrt is NOT going to be serving any dhcp clients, it is only a client itself.</p><p>Help!!!!!!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>projects</strong> on 11 Apr 2014, 06:36)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m a bit confused as to what your network configuration is / what your desired outcome is.. </p><p>However DNS server&#039;s are not specific from network to network.&nbsp; For example 8.8.8.8 is google&#039;s DNS, and can be used on any network, anywhere in the world (unless it is being actively blocked).&nbsp; The network dependent type of DNS; is DNS Mascarading, which allows you to assign names to internal network resources (EX. //toms-pc vs 192.168.1.10); but I don&#039;t believe that is what you are talking about.</p><p>In general, when a client connects to DHCP enabled network, the client will also defer to the same router for the proper DNS server.&nbsp; If none is listed, the settings supplied by the internet service provider at the dsl or cable modem is used.</p>									</div>

					<p>I found this on a web site, unfortunately, I didn&#039;t catch the URL. Thanks to whom ever posted this.</p><p>-----------------</p><p>OpenWRT and resolving private ranges</p><p>For quite a long time, I have a problem, that DNS in my OpenWRT box does not resolv local range on wan interface. Today I have learned that it is doing it in order to protect me:</p><p>dnsmasq[15709]: possible DNS-rebind attack detected: jmnet.czf</p><p>But hey, my wan interface has 10.* address and I want to resolve 10.* domains there!</p><p>A little bit of googling revealed that this is caused by --stop-dns-rebind passed to dnsmasq. Okay, the easiest fix is to disable it. You need to change /etc/config/dhcp:</p><p>config &#039;dnsmasq&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;rebind_protection&#039; &#039;0&#039;</p><p>After reading source of /etc/init.d/dnsmasq I realized there is also way to whitelist some domains, what sounds like a slightly better idea. After fighting with syntax, I found the solution to be (again in /etc/config/dhcp):</p><p>config &#039;dnsmasq&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; list &#039;rebind_domain&#039; &#039;/czf/&#039;</p><p>-------------------------</p><p>More specifically, in my case, I want to use the upstream dhcp server provided dns servers so the fix was;</p><p>option &#039;rebind_protection&#039; &#039;0&#039;</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>projects</strong> on 11 Apr 2014, 07:12)</p>
