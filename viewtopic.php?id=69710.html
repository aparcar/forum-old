					<p>Hey Guys</p><p>I&#039;m new to OpenWRT but thought I would give it a try. I&#039;ve procured a TP-Link Archer C7 router (V2). I tried to flash it initially but there was a block on it which I managed to remove after reading the following thread at thread on the DD-WRT forum, which I can share if allowed.</p><p>I worked through the process and managed to flash my router to the DD-WRT firmware, after this I flashed it to a previous stock firmware version that did not have a block on it. After this I attempted to flash it to OpenWRT using the guide found here:</p><p>wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/archer-c5-c7-wdr7500</p><p>On this page I saw the warning that my V2 might have an hardware change. My V2 serial number was later than prescribed so I downloaded the sysupgrade image as described: &quot;If you want to install 15.05.1 with support for the new gd25q128 flash chip you can download this factory or sysupgrade image&quot; and flashed it.</p><p>I am not able to access the web server at 192.168.1.1 or at 192.168.0.1 after the router rebooted. Any suggestions?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey Guys</p><p>I am able to ping the router at 192.168.1.1 and I am able to make a connection using putty/ssh. When I connect using putty, I am prompted for a password. I&#039;ve tried the following combinations:</p><p>User: admin<br />Password: admin</p><p>User: admin<br />Password: password</p><p>User: admin<br />Password:</p><p>User: root<br />Password: password</p><p>User: root<br />Password: passwd</p><p>User: root<br />Password:</p><p>But I am unable to access the router.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>Last night I also tried to get the roueter into recovery mode to try and reflash the unblocked TP Link firmware onto it using TFTP. The OpenWRT guide to activate the recovery mode states the following:</p><p>To activate TFTP Recovery press and hold WPS/Reset Button during powering on until WPS LED turns on. Setup your computer to 192.168.0.66 (SubnetMask /24 = 255.255.255.0) and connect it to LAN1. Start TFTP server and provide recovery file with it.</p><p>However I am unable to get recovery mode to activate. I do see the WPS led turn on but then it turns off again and when I run IP config then I&#039;m still tied to gateway 192.168.1.1. I&#039;ve tried pining 192.168.0.86 as well but it just times out.</p><p>I&#039;m hoping that you guys can walk me through installing Luci and that installing Luci would resolve my concerns, fingers crossed.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you can enter failsafe -- there&#039;s no password required for ssh in failsafe mode. You can reset your password once you ssh into your router in failsafe mode.</p><p>PS. Do not press and hold the button -- rapidly press and release it during the bootup until you see one of the LEDs (forgot which one) flash rapidly. You can then recover your router.</p><p>PPS. Make sure NOT to flash stock firmware with _boot in the filename!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stangri</strong> on 5 Feb 2017, 21:53)</p>

					<p>Hello Everyone, I managed to resolve this. I didn&#039;t enter my recover mode correctly but found the following Youtube video that helped me to do it correctly:</p><p>Part that follows watch at the end watch in the address bar Fi0pC_ON5Vo (sorry can&#039;t share links)</p><p>I also managed to flash the firmware back to an official version. After this I downloaded the factory binary for my router and flashed it again. Still no access to Luci, but I managed to connect with Putty following the following the howto-firstlogin guide. After this I was able to install Luci following the howto-luci.essentials</p><p>And from there I had access to everything I needed. Sorry guys, newbie here with regards to all these things. Needless to say, I&#039;ve learnt a lot over the past 2 days and also stepped up my security around the house etc.</p><p>Thanks for the comments, it pointed me in the right direction.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Dirka</strong> on 6 Feb 2017, 06:48)</p>

					<p>@Dirka</p><p>Most likely you flashed a trunk image, which doesn&#039;t have LuCI included.</p><p>nitroshift</p>									</div>
