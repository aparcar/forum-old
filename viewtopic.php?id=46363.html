					<p>Hello all,</p><br /><p>I&#039;m currently using a TP-Link TL-WR703N router with OpenWrt to repeat a FON Free Network.</p><p>As most of you already know, the FON Free Network is an open network which uses a browser authentication method for its users to access internet (based on WISPr protocol I believe).</p><p>While it strengths the signal well (accomplishing its repeater function), obviously it asks for authentication as it would if I was connecting to the original FON Free router.</p><p>I intend to go to the next level and automate the authentication on the repeater, making sure the network repeated accesses directly to the internet. Can OpenWrt do this (or other firmware/method for that matter)?</p><br /><p>Thank you!</p><p>References:<br /><a href="https://code.google.com/p/androidwisprclient/">https://code.google.com/p/androidwisprclient/</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Sure very possibly, but since I don&#039;t have such an access point nearby it is too hard to stick it together (for me).</p><p>But some additional stuff about this:<br /><a href="http://wiki.maemo.org/WISPr_Wireless_ISP_Autologin#Automated_WISPr_hotspot_login">http://wiki.maemo.org/WISPr_Wireless_IS … spot_login</a><br /><a href="https://github.com/matsuu/auwifispot-client/blob/master/wispr_login.pl">https://github.com/matsuu/auwifispot-cl … r_login.pl</a></p><p>only it is written in perl, but it could be ported to an sh script or proper c coding.</p><p>edit: Well the fonera info I found on Google got me interested enough to order one <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> so I guess stay tuned.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>FriedZombie</strong> on 20 Sep 2013, 11:44)</p>

					<p>I realise this is an old topic but as my broadband went down I actually needed to figure out how to do this to keep things online via nearby <strong>BTWiFi-with-FON</strong> hotspots.</p><p>I couldn&#039;t figure out how to get all the dependencies for the perl script above so downloaded it and picked out the bits I needed to authenticate manually with <strong>BTWiFi-with-FON</strong> spots.</p><p>I saved the following script as <strong>/root/fon</strong>, <strong>chmod 755 fon</strong> and then added it to <strong>/etc/rc.local</strong> so it starts at boot:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>#!/bin/sh</p><p>while [ 1 = 1 ]; do<br />&nbsp; DATE=$(date)<br />&nbsp; CONNECTED=$(ifconfig wlan0 | grep &quot;inet addr&quot;)<br />&nbsp; if [ -n &quot;$CONNECTED&quot; ]; then<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ROUTER=$(route -n | grep UG | awk &#039;{ print $2;}&#039;)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; AUTHENTICATED=$(ping -c5 -W 1 -w 5 8.8.8.8 -q | grep &quot;100% packet loss&quot;)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; DATE=$(date)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; if [ -n &quot;$AUTHENTICATED&quot; ]; then<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; logger &quot;BTFON: $DATE Internet access is blocked, attempting to login to BTFON...&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wget -O /tmp/fonlogin --quiet --no-check-certificate &quot;<a href="https://www.btopenzone.com:8443/wbacOpen?username=BTFON/email@dress&amp;password=password">https://www.btopenzone.com:8443/wbacOpe … d=password</a>&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sleep 10<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; else<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; logger &quot;BTFON: $DATE FON is working!&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; fi<br />&nbsp; else<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; logger &quot;BTFON: $DATE wlan0 has no IP, waiting for DHCP to complete...&quot;<br />&nbsp; fi<br />&nbsp; sleep 5<br />done</p></blockquote></div><p><span class="bbu">Dependencies:</span><br />You need to install the full version of wget as the busybox version does not support SSL.</p><p><span class="bbu">Customisation:</span><br />wlan0 above needs to be the wifi card used to connect to FON.<br />If you are using this to login with a BTFON account you just need to change the <strong>email@ddress</strong> and <strong>password</strong> to your own.&nbsp; If you want to login with a BT Broadband account you will need to change the <strong>BTFON/</strong> prefix as well although I cannot remember off the top of my head what it needs to be.</p><p>If you are wanting to use <strong>BTFON</strong> spots or any other FON provider, the URL will be completely different.&nbsp; You can find this out from the page source of the login page.</p><p>Also, it WILL fill your log with messages but as I am using a router dedicated to this task it made sense for it be as verbose as possible for me.&nbsp; Just comment out <strong>logger &quot;BTFON: $DATE FON is working!&quot;</strong> to remove the majority of the log messages.</p>									</div>
