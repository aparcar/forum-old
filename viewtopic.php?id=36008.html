					<p>Hi there,</p><p>Firstly, I&#039;ll explain, I am very new to modding routers so please go easy! Now, we are about to get a new router which means I get the old router (hooray!). Therefore, obviously, I am going to hack it as I want to use it either to extend signal or to use it as a wireless receiver. However, that can be sorted later, need to install the firmware first! I looked it up and the first thing I did was go to the DD-WRT forums. I soon realised my router was not compatible and they didn&#039;t really have an urge to help me, so I have come here in the hope my router is semi compatible, I may be able to write some firmware myself of necessary. So I started with compatibility list and didn&#039;t find anything so looked at the old list. I found a router that was called Prestige 660HW-61. Now, my router is the P-660HW-D1. I couldn&#039;t help seeing the similarity. I looked at the status and it said untested. I am more than happy to be the tester though! I put a lot of info about my router on the DD-WRT forums and as I am currently on a very dodgy phone and phone connection, I can&#039;t put all that info into this post so I will just have to give a link for the time being: <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=153226">http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=153226</a> I hope it is sufficient. Reading through that thread will probably help as well. So, overall, my question is, is my router compatible and if not, what do I have to do to make it compatible? I am sure you are all busy like me but any help would be much appreciated. I hope you are able to help.</p><p>Music Guy</p>									</div>

					<p>Please can someone help or at least please can someone tell me what I need to do. It would be so much appreciated. I really do want to get this working for my router. If you guys could give me help, I would be happy to start writing patches, I have a couple of friends who are very good programmers that I know would help me. So, I would be able to add another router to the compatibility list! All I need is a little help to hopefully point me in the right direction so, please can someone help?</p>									</div>
