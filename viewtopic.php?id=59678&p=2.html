					<p>I use a GL-iNet router coupled with a rather bulky Aukey 20,000 mAh USB battery device and don&#039;t find it to be too much of an inconvenience. Software wise it is setup with an OpenVPN connection and with a little finessing using my phones hotspot I can connect it to any wifi I want. It does have the potential for a secondary wifi adapter via the USB port assuming you can find the right openwrt drivers for the wifi dongle to use. Considering it uses openwrt the availability of things it could be made to do (samba or minidlna) are certainly expanded. However personally I wouldn&#039;t want to use my &quot;travel router&quot; as a media or file server of any sort. </p><p>I plan to use a script I found for AAP to see how well that works allowing the router to default to my home or hotspot networks when other available networks aren&#039;t around. Ideally it would be nice to get the AP setup regardless of client status but I haven&#039;t found information on this quite yet.<br />The OpenVPN requires a manual setup through ssh, but once I ironed out the problems it was quite easy to have it brought up and it can be stopped/started/reset from the openwrt menu as necessary.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have a HooToo TM02 set up with OpenVPN and a USB Wireless adapter, and it works well, but I can not disagree more about the external battery.&nbsp; It is VERY inconvenient, and I rarely use it for this single reason.&nbsp; Again, would you walk around with an external battery on your phone?</p><p>I am amazed how this community defends an external battery.&nbsp; My post premise is it is not acceptable.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want a hacker or breadboard solution.&nbsp; I need something that fits in a pocket and does not come apart.&nbsp; Look at the HooToo product line.&nbsp; All but one now have batteries. <a href="http://www.hootoo.com/portable-travel-router.html">http://www.hootoo.com/portable-travel-router.html</a></p><p>I do not know what AAP is and it is not in the wiki.&nbsp; Any tools that help the wifi config are welcome,&nbsp; The current wireless tool set in OpenWRT, with portable devices, is outdated functionally.&nbsp; It worked OK with a stable bridge at home, but does not in a dynamic world and frequently changing connections.&nbsp; </p><p>The new Material theme is a promising design, and I hope it can be made to perform better&nbsp; It solves no technical issues, other than usability on a smart phone.</p>									</div>

					<p>Considering that it does function as an external battery for my phone I don&#039;t see what the difference is. Obviously something like the GL-iNet would be nice with a built in battery. But since I am already carrying around the external battery to charge devices as needed it can function to power the GL-iNet without trying to find some router that has all the features that make the GL-iNet appealing while also having a built in battery.</p>									</div>

					<p>NO, your phone CAN function with out the battery.&nbsp; The GL.Inet can not.&nbsp; Big difference.&nbsp; An external battery is BACKUP.</p><p>If your a real road warrior and go between APs 4-6 times a day for short periods, this is not workable.</p><p>Maybe we can agree to disagree.</p>									</div>

Lots of C, lua, bash, and html5/javascript added with touch screen support. No Luci. Saves wifi hotspot passwords just like ur cell. Disables station mode if no known station is detected within timeout, so you can access the router using wifi. Integrated VPN interface where one screen configures all supported VPN protocols i.e&nbsp; IPSecure, OpenVPN, IKEv2, L2TP, PPTP. Supports both incoming and outgoing VPN. The travel version of the router does the same stuff minus incoming VPN. We use our own C code to handle high speed multipart/form-data for efficient file upload handling with http upload speeds reaching same&nbsp; as FTP/SAMBA.&nbsp; No temporary files generated by upload code. No large memory foot print like in php scripts. No file upload size limits over http. HTML uploads can be a pain if com is lost, so we added auto retry and continue upload feature that works behind the scenes to ensure file uploads are successful. The file sharing feature can convert your travel router into a http server over the net for the files you chose, even when your travel router does not have a public IP address. </p><p>Essentially VPN, full control of USB storage using any modern browser,&nbsp; EZ file sharing with efficient wifi hotspot handling. Most of the stuff that you will need when you travel. I will provide the links soon.</p>									</div>
