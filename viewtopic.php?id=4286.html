					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m looking for a way to graph network/bandwith usage on a per-host basis. Ideally, I&#039;d like something that&#039;ll have a single graph, with colour-coded lines based on hostnames/ip addresses. I&#039;ve looked at a few of the docs on the openwrt website, but they all seem to deal with snmp to graph usage per physical interface. </p><p>Anyone have any ideas what i could use to do this?</p><p>Thanks</p><p>--Eoghan</p>									</div>

					<p>There&#039;s some discussion about graphing in dd-wrt phorum ... <br />Maybe it will help <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br /><a href="http://forum.bsr-clan.de/ftopic4802.html">http://forum.bsr-clan.de/ftopic4802.html</a></p><p>Dino</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, DD-WRT forums accesible but not main page?&nbsp; Also&nbsp; linksysinfo..... *sigh*</p><p>Anyhow, I have used MRTG for years to get the 10,000 foot view. Often this suffices.</p><p>In the sense that this shows me when there&#039;s an issue and I drill down from there.<br />I haven&#039;t tried this cacti program, but anything that aggregates SNMP data should be<br />lightweight enough to run on a WRT without impacting flow rates.</p><p>I have also used NTop, which is impressive and will let you do all the stuff you mentioned<br />and more.&nbsp; However I ran it on a PIII-850 Linux router with 3 interfaces and the load when<br />it was inspecting packets on all 3 interfaces was noticable. Worth a look though. I do not run<br />it constantly, but I sometimes run it to track down particular problems.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 31 Jan 2006, 19:33)</p>
