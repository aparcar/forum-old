					<p>I followed this instructions :<br />1. Connect your PC to the WR703N and configure it with a static IP of 192.168.1.2<br />2. Visit <a href="http://192.168.1.1/userRpm/SoftwareUpgradeRpm.htm">http://192.168.1.1/userRpm/SoftwareUpgradeRpm.htm</a><br />3. Upload the latest OpenWrt snapshot for the TL-WR703N (http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … actory.bin)<br />4. Wait 4-5 minutes for the firmware to upload and the device to reboot. The blue LED will be lit solid when it&#039;s finished.<br />5. You should be able to telnet to the device on 192.168.1.1 and receive an OpenWrt prompt (no password required)<br />6. Set a password on the device (use the &quot;passwd&quot; command). Note: once you&#039;ve done this you will need to SSH to the device, telnet will be disabled.<br />7. Configure /etc/config/network with an IP address, gateway and DNS servers that allow the device to access the Internet. Either reboot the device or run &quot;/etc/init.d/network restart&quot; to apply the settings.<br />8.

					<p>You need to add a line in the lan section:<br />option dns &#039;xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx&#039;, where the ip address of dns server can be either your gateway address or, as I usually do, using some public domain dns servers, e.g., &#039;208.67.222.222&#039; which is an opendns server.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>									</div>

POE remote power supply, the application is idle foot 4/5 and 7/8 foot DC power supply to the remote device. <br />2. cable fine, relatively high resistivity, so generally the higher voltage transmission (typically 12-48V ), to reduce line losses.<br />3. distal generally require the voltage drop back to normal voltage suitable for the route used.</p><br /><p>poe :<br /><a href="http://www.eidusa.com/Electronics_Kits_PoE_injector.htm">http://www.eidusa.com/Electronics_Kits_PoE_injector.htm</a></p></blockquote></div><p>The power supply fitted inside the WR703N is an MP2307-based DC-DC step-down power supply &quot;KIS-3R33s&quot; module with 4.75-23V 3A input and 95% efficiency. Just search for &quot;KISS-3R33&quot; on eBay, you can find some &lt; $2 with free shipping.</p><p>Then basically, it says that usually only wires 1,2,3 and 6 are used in an RJ45 10/100 BASE-T Ethernet cable, so you can use the available 4,5,7 and 8 wires to carry power, but as these wires have high resistivity, you should power with at least 12V-48V to minimize losses.</p><p>However, it looks like they count on some voltage drop, as the KIS3R33 only withstand up to 23V.</p><p>You better have some spare WR703N to experiment <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
