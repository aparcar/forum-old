IPoE, PPPoE or any tunnel type like PPtP or L2TP?</p><p>Atheros AR9132 can give you about 150-170 mbps through NAT via IPoE, ~100-120 mbps via PPPoE or 70-80mbps via L2TP/PPtP using AA firmware or optimized BB build, with CC or DD you need substruct about a quarter of theese values</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stas2z</strong> on 2 Jun 2016, 12:48)</p>

In other words, a 330 Mbps is way much slower than a 120-130 MBps, i.e. 1 MBps ~= 8 Mbps. So, if your former measure of 330 download was in Mbps (~ 41.25 MBps) while the later 120-130 download was in MBps (~ 1Gbps or ~ 1,000 Mbps), then obviously the later is at least 3x faster than the former.</p>									</div>

					<p>Comparing the speed of a direct connection to the modem with one through a router running OpenWRT is not a useful comparison to determine whether OpenWRT is causing the bottleneck. It may simply be the limitations of the hardware. If you want to know, then try reverting to stock router firmware and see what speed you get then.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Degeneratescum</strong> on 3 Jun 2016, 17:58)</p>
