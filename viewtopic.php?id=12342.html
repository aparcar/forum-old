					<p>I&#039;m using the WRT54GL as an access point to access a server that is connected to one of the 4 LAN ports.The WLAN is configured without security.&nbsp; There are at least 50 clients using the AP at the same time. </p><p>The big problem: The WRT54GL is rebooting from time to time, the reboot interval ranges from just a few minutes to several hours. I have tried whiterussion rc0.6 and whiterussion 0.9, and even the original linksys firmware, the problem is always the same. I have tried several different WRT54GL&#039;s, that doesn&#039;t change anything as well.</p>									</div>
