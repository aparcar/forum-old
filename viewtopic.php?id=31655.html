					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I am having an issue with the IPERF UDP test. I was hoping someone could point me in the right direction. We have Backfire fire installed on a Buffalo router with openwrt. I am using a Windows 7 machine one on end at the head office and Openwrt at a regional office. Connectivity through the vpn is fine, user are able to access shares, VoIP works (most of the time). I am working on doing some benchmark testing inorder to improve our VoIP issues down the line. When I set up the Windows 7 machine as the server and run the TCP and UDP from the openwrt (which is the client) everything works fine. Going the other way (Windows 7 sends data as the client and openwrt receives as the server) TCP works fine, but Windows 7 machine reports read failed: connection reset by peer. I checked the firewall logs of the Firewall on Windows 7 side and no packets from the Windows 7 machine were reported as dropped, so I assume it must be the Openwrt side of things that is the problem. The firewall.users also has a router setup accepting traffic from my ip range. I also created a rule to forward udp traffic on port 5001, which is the port used for testing.</p><br /><p>config &#039;rule&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;src&#039; &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;udp&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;des_port&#039; &#039;5001&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;target&#039; &#039;ACCEPT&#039;</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Shawn</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>shodg001</strong> on 31 Aug 2011, 12:50)</p>

					<p>Hi Shawn,</p><p>I would start with some simple packet captures. The OpenWRT device you can install tcpdump to see if the UDP traffic is even reaching the OpenWRT device. Note that if you apply a tcpdump filter to only catch UDP then you should also catch ICMP (i.e. use the filter &quot;udp or icmp&quot;), as ICMP is used to communicate errors back to the client. On the Windows box you can of course use Wireshark to do the same.</p><p>That&#039;s where I&#039;d start, but it does still sound like a firewall somewhere is causing you issues. Is there any NAT&#039;ing going on with your VPN?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Sam</p>									</div>
