					<p>Hi,</p><p>The LED blinking issue is resolved for the R02. Currently working on the VLANs. I&#039;ve not tested the USB ports yet. I&#039;ll do that after the VLAN issue. Maybe merge the 2 topics together and make 1 VGV7519 support topic?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello mkresin, thanks for your attention.</p><br /><div class="quotebox"><cite>mkresin wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>That&#039;s the point I don&#039;t get. Either the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch/">switch</a> isn&#039;t initialized...</p></blockquote></div><p>I did not see any information in the boot log about the initialization of the switch and had the fenomeen that traffic was going between eth0 and eth1 that not shout be there. A client PC connected tot the lan ports (eth0) was getting a DHCP ip from the wan (eth1) DHCP server, I did see all the traffic with tcpdump on the wan port, strange the eth0 and eth1 where bridging as one hub. Even with &quot;swconfig list&quot; I did not see a switch and experimenting with vlans on the eth1 port did not work.</p><p>Did see your update at <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=322432#p322432">fix</a>, interesting!</p><br /><div class="quotebox"><cite>mkresin wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>... as long as it isn&#039;t <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger&#039;s_cat">schroedingers</a> switch.</p></blockquote></div><p>LOL</p><br /><div class="quotebox"><cite>mkresin wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Regardless what&#039;s your real problem, please <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build">compile the latest development version of openwrt</a> (<a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/wiki/GetSource">How to download the OpenWrt source</a>) and check whether the problem persist!</p></blockquote></div><p>I did used the Chaos Calmer in the beginning, after that I used a own build.
