					<p>Make the folders &quot;chmod ugoa+w folder&quot; to give full permissions. How do I create&nbsp; user and group in passwd. If possible give me your configuration. I need that because I can&#039;t access to my share. Windows ask for user and password.<br />Please help</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pbernardino</strong> on 6 Sep 2007, 11:14)</p>
