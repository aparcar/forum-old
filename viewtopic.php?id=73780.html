					<p>Hi, I&#039;d like to be able to install make in my uClibC environment with OpenWrt 15.05.1 Chaos Calmer, but I see that there is no package available for make in this version. Could we backport one?</p><p>I am aware that OpenWrt v17 LEDE is an option, but I am interested in v15 for its uClibC support.</p>									</div>

					<p>While I&#039;m not an OpenWrt developer and obviously can&#039;t speak for them, it&#039;s rather safe to assume that the Chaos Calmer branch is in &quot;critical-bugfixes-only mode&quot; (if even that) and won&#039;t gain new features, that&#039;s what the master branch is for. The same obviously applies to your other suggestions for new package additions to Chaos Calmer as well.</p>									</div>
