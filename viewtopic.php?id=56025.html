					<p>Until I switched ISPs recently I had WDS set up across two openwrt routers so that I could connect my wired network printer to my wifi network. My new ISP gave me a new router and as a result I no longer have WDS and hence cannot connect the printer using wifi.</p><p>I tried using a pseudobridge, but I got some odd behavior. I couldn&#039;t resolve the hostname of the printer, so I couldn&#039;t print from Windows, only Linux. Also ARP requests kept on being sent by the printer as they went unanswered. I get the feeling the ARP translation was screwing things up.</p><p>I was thinking of writing a very simple fully transparent bridge between the wifi interface and a wired interface on the router. The wired interface would be a single-port vlan running in promiscuous mode. The printer would be connected to that port. To get round the 3 MAC addresses / 4 nodes problem, the wifi iface MAC address would be the same as the printer&#039;s wired one. The bridge would relay packets in both direction unaltered. And because they are unaltered, all protocols like ARP, DNS etc should work transparently.</p><p>Please let me know if there is already is a solution that does this though.</p><p>The only downside is that the bridge would be running from user space, as I will be using the recvfrom and sendto syscalls. Typical bridges run in kernal space, so I&#039;m not sure how much of a performance hit it would take.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah I&#039;m running Barrier Breaker on the Buffalo WBMR-HP-G300H too, following those exact same instructions. I might give it another shot just in case I fudged something, but I remember doing it two or three times in an attempt to get it fully working.</p><p>I read somewhere in the openwrt documentation that the relayd/pseudobridge works on the same principle as Broadcom&#039;s proprietary WET and that has issues too. So I&#039;m guessing both are suffering from the same problems when using MAC address translation.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;d say reset the OpenWrt installation to defaults and then start again with just the relayd recipe.</p><p>I managed to get relayd installed and working on a Nano Station Loco 2 with Attitude Adjustment on Saturday evening and it works like a charm.&nbsp; That said, during the recipe when it called for restarting wifi I got various errors in the SSH terminal.&nbsp; At that point I logged out and power reset the Nano and from then on the recipe proceeded without a hitch.&nbsp; I also did the very last step so the Nano would be accessible over the network just in case.</p><p>My Buffalo is a WZR-600dhp, not that it really matters.&nbsp; The only issue I have had with this setup is if the AP is reset for any reason, then the Buffalo client loses its association (of course) and I power reset it.&nbsp; Perhaps it will associate again after a time but I am generally too impatient to wait that long.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Nate</strong> on 2 Mar 2015, 17:50)</p>
