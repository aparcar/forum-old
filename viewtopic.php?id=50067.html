					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I would like to have real multi-user for web, so I want to use and know more about LuCI2. It seems not much discussion on LuCI2 in recent time. <br />It looks like LuCI2 project is still in update not long before, I don&#039;t know if there is a released version.<br />I remember a few weeks ago when I installed luci package, it was automatically LuCI2 installed and shown in menuconfig, but I cannot remember which version of OpenWrt it was. I cannot find the way to install LuCI2 for neither Barrier Breaker nor Attitude Adjustment now.<br />Is there any body using LuCI2 as web interface? <br />If I want to immigrant my module on LuCI to LuCI2, is it straightforward, such as just a copy work?<br />Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>@Zajec: LuCI is a contraction of Lua and UCI. As LuCI2 is no longer based on these but rather on JS, XHR and ubus, I suggest using a completely different name to avoid confusion.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Zajec, thank you for reply. I see it is totally different from LuCI, maybe Squonk have a good suggestion.</p><p>I built LuCI2 with Barrier Breaker. When I visit 192.168.1.1/luci2.html, I think this might be same as index.html, it has a login option. I fill up username and password, it is stunned at “Loading data…”。<br />I don&#039;t know the reason of it. it sounds like a silly question, I am sorry.</p><br /><p>And also, I failed to build it on 12.09 for a board. Error is below.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they are set to NOTFOUND.

					<p>In trunk, build process is all right. But it seems not quite stable.<br />As I mentioned, I use LuCI2 on Compex WP543, I cannot login.<br />I also tried LuCI2 on Tplink tl-wdr3600. I can login this time, but I cannot do changes, such as setting password, flashing image, reset configuration and so on.</p>									</div>
