					<p>Dear All,</p><p>I&#039;m new here. I have an problem with an D-Link DGS-1248T switch. I know this site is mostly for routers but i will give it an try. I think there is a lot of simularity with routers.</p><p>First of all i will give all info i could discover:</p><p>Brand: D-Link<br />Device: DGS-1248T<br />Hardware Rev: B1<br />Initial FW: 3.00.07</p><p>CPU: Marvell - 88E6218-LG01<br />RAM: Mira - P2V64S40ETP<br />ROM: Intel - JS28F160C3BD70</p><p>There are 2 places for headers i populated:<br />1) 6 Pin - UART Connection to CPU<br />2) 20 Pin - JTAG Connection to CPU</p><p>The issue is that the switch doesn&#039;t run, the CPU LED on the front stays off. I connected the UART to my PC and started the terminal. The CPU runs ARMboot. The &quot;Hit any key for boot setup&quot; appears.</p><p>If i do nothing the CPU will boot and after the message &quot;wss-ii driver initialization done&quot; the CPU hangs and the terminal stops working.</p><p>If i hit any key during boot i get into the ARMboot Menu.</p><p>I think the ROM flash is corrupt or broken. D-Link only supplies .hex files for the firmware. Should I load this file in the CPU or in ROM Flash memory? And how?</p><p>Would great if somebody could help me get this thing running again.</p><p>//Kevin</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Zitz</strong> on 15 Nov 2017, 11:40)</p>
