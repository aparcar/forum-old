					<p>I upgraded (my TP-Link Archer C20i) from CC RC1 to CC RC2 using the LuCI web interface. I checked &quot;Keep settings&quot;. The upgrade completed perfectly fine.</p><p>Later I realised I could not use opkg properly, and it turned out I had to replace 15.05-rc1 with 15.05-rc2 in /etc/opkg.conf.</p><p>I don&#039;t remember having to do this before. It was not much of a problem, but also not what I expected.<br /> - feature?<br /> - did I do anything wrong?<br /> - bug with CC?<br /> - bug with my ralink/mt7620 target?<br /> - bug with Archer C20i?</p>									</div>

					<p>I have noticed the same when switching between CC versions or from trunk to cc &amp;back.<br />/etc/opkg.conf gets preserved as a config file, while it should change to reflect the new download repo.</p><p>I would classify that as a feature, although I am not quite sure how long it has been that way.<br />Earlier the possible location error was not that visible, but the new package list signing key system highlights the possible error more prominently.</p><p>The proper opkg.conf can be found as /rom/etc/opkg.conf</p><br /><p>EDIT:<br />Well, it has been that way (preserved as a config file at sysupgrade) since r12319 in 2008...<br /><a href="http://git.openwrt.org/?p=openwrt.git;a=commitdiff;h=d5dc9a90873047ab07107833a950320ae3b2b41f">http://git.openwrt.org/?p=openwrt.git;a â€¦ 0ae3b2b41f</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 16 Jun 2015, 23:05)</p>
