					<p>If I understand right how pppoe works then PADT (termination) only informs the other end that the connection was terminated. So I think just ignoring PADT will do nothing because the side that sent PADT doesn&#039;t wait for confirmation.</p><p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2516">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2516</a></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>5.5 The PPPoE Active Discovery Terminate (PADT) packet</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This packet may be sent anytime after a session is established to<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;indicate that a PPPoE session has been terminated.&nbsp; It may be sent by<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;either the Host or the Access Concentrator.&nbsp; The DESTINATION_ADDR<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;field is a unicast Ethernet address, the CODE field is set to 0xa7<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;and the SESSION_ID MUST be set to indicate which session is to be<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;terminated.&nbsp; No TAGs are required.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;When a PADT is received, no further PPP traffic is allowed to be sent<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;using that session.&nbsp; Even normal PPP termination packets MUST NOT be<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sent after sending or receiving a PADT.&nbsp; A PPP peer SHOULD use the<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;PPP protocol itself to bring down a PPPoE session, but the PADT MAY<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;be used when PPP can not be used.</p></blockquote></div><p>Isn&#039;t the router trying to reconnect after disconnect?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>thedukesd</strong> on 22 Jun 2016, 01:33)</p>
