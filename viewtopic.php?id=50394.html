					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve waded through all the information I could find and I&#039;m stuck.&nbsp; I have a TP-Link TL-1043ND router running Backfire 10.03.1.&nbsp; I&#039;ve successfully configured it to authenticate all wireless clients to an external RADIUS server using EAP-TLS.</p><p>The problem is that I&#039;d like to extend that to the wired portion of the router.&nbsp; I can&#039;t seem to find any information on the topic (or if it is even possible). It is really a trival matter to set it up for wireless and it seems everybody writes information for that, but what good is it when you can plug a cable up and get instant access with no authenication.</p><p>Any help/insight would be appreciated!</p>									</div>
