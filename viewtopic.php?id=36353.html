					<p>I&#039;m sure I&#039;m doing something wrong. I just installed openwrt on my router and that went smoothly.<br />I changed the root password.<br />setup secure wifi and can connect to it.</p><p>But for some reason I can&#039;t get to the internet from the LAN/Wifi side of the router. The internet connection is live, because if I connect my computer to it directly I can get on the internet.</p><p>I have only been using the web interface, because I&#039;m not a great with Linux or CLI. If I need to drop to CLI to fix the problem I will.</p><p>If I go to Network&gt;Interfaces the WAN connection says it is up and has pulled a IP address. BUT if I click on Status (opening screen) under Network, IPv4 WAN Status says Not connected. I dont know why.</p><p>All other config is out of the box at this point. Oh currently running backfire 10.03.1 on ver 1.8 hardware.</p><p>UPDATE: I used Putty to ssh into the router and tried to have it ping google.com. No dice.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dTardis</strong> on 20 Apr 2012, 20:27)</p>

					<p>It should just work unless the internet is provided by a cable modem. A cable modem must be rebooted after you connect it to the OpenWRT router.</p><p>Post the contents of /etc/config/network.</p>									</div>

					<p>The WAN interface showing an IP and the status showing not connected suggests something isn&#039;t configured properly.</p><p>You could reset to defaults and test but it may be unnecessary if you are confident your changes aren&#039;t causing the problem:</p><p>Reset router to defaults.<br />Connect PC to a LAN port and using DHCP it will receive a 192.168.1.x IP from the router.<br />Connect internet connection to the WAN port and using DHCP the router will receive an IP, DNS and gateway IP from whatever provides the internet connection.<br />Use putty to telnet 192.168.1.1 and run ping <a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a>.</p><p>If the problem still exists after the default configuration test you should switch your attention to the configuration of the internet connection device for example perhaps both devices are configured to use the same broadcast domain? You can check using the route command when you ssh into the OpenWRT router. If that is the problem you could configure the OpenWRT router to use 192.168.2.x instead of 192.168.1.x.</p><p>You have not mentioned the purpose of the OpenWRT router but if it is to work as a wired/wireless switch you could configure OpenWRT appropriately and connect the internet connection to a LAN port.</p>									</div>
