					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I work for a reasonably well known game developer in the UK, whose systems are 99% Windows based, and whose IT staff of three (including myself) have a very limited knowledge of Linux. Now we&#039;ve hit a rather large snag!</p><p>One of our external testing teams has come across a bug in one of our Xbox 360 games that <em>only</em> happens when the NAT type is reported by the Xbox as strict. Since Thursday we&#039;ve been desperately trying to induce a strict NAT type, and have tried rules in our main firewall (a Cisco PIX), scouring Google for reports of routers using it - and then buying them, to various different firmwares for our Buffalo WHR-HP-G54.</p><p>So far the closest we&#039;ve come is with the Netgear WRG614, reported to use strict NATing and available in our local computer store. We duly bought one and upon setting it up could get nothing but open and moderate types! Further research suggests that the main offender was actually version 6 of the hardware, whereas we have version 9. A dead-end.</p><p>Pending any further hardware acquisitions, our hopes now rest on OpenWRT. We can see that this setup has the potential to be incredibly powerful, and we&#039;re convinced that it has the ability to force its NAT type to be strict, but as none of us are Linux professionals we&#039;ve really just hit a brick wall. Of course it doesn&#039;t help that any information about strict NATing we can find online is just about how to avoid or fix it, not how to induce it!</p><p>We&#039;ve installed OpenWRT 8.09.1 Kamikaze on the aforementioned Buffalo router (hence posting here) but are quite happy to switch over to White Russian if necessary.</p><p>Can you help us to get this working? None of us are averse to using a command shell or getting our hands dirty with VIM so please post anything you think will help!</p><p>I can&#039;t promise anything, but I&#039;ll do all I can to get anyone that gives some useful advice into the credits of our game.</p><p>Much thanks in advance,</p><p>Max</p>									</div>

					<p>Just realised that it might not be obvious what a strict NAT type relates to, so here&#039;s Microsoft&#039;s definition:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p><strong>Port Assignment Policy</strong></p><p>After it receives a packet from a client device on the internal subnet, the NAT process selects a public port to represent the private client device and source port leading to the external network.</p><p>The NAT uses two techniques to accomplish this.</p><p><strong>*</strong> The NAT can assign one port to each source port that is used by a client device, regardless of the destination of the packet. This is often called a minimal port assignment policy, because NAT assigns the minimum number of ports.</p><p><strong>*</strong> The NAT can assign a different port for each packet destination. This is often called an aggressive port assignment policy, because NAT assigns many ports. This policy makes it very difficult to establish peer-to-peer connectivity between two devices that are behind NATs. Users behind a symmetric NAT can connect to the Xbox LIVE service. They can also join some games. However, they can also fail to establish peer-to-peer connectivity. This can lead to problems with in-game voice communication, or the inability to join some game sessions.</p><p><strong>Port Filtering Policy</strong></p><p>NATs often applies filters on incoming traffic, much as a firewall does.</p><p>The three NAT filtering policies are the following:</p><p><strong>*</strong> No Filtering. Any packet that is addressed to a port that the NAT has assigned to a client device is forwarded.</p><p><strong>*</strong> Address Sensitive Filtering. A packet that is addressed to a port that the NAT has assigned is forwarded only if it originated from an IP address to which the client device communicated previously.</p><p><strong>*</strong> Address and Port Sensitive Filtering. A packet that is addressed to a port that the NAT has assigned is forwarded only if it originated from an IP address and port to which the client device communicated previously.</p><p><strong>Xbox LIVE Port Assignment and Filtering Policies</strong></p><p>Xbox LIVE internally defines seven main categories, based on the matrix of NAT port assignment and filtering policies.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>*</strong> 1 = No NAT<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>*</strong> 2 = Minimal port assignment and no filtering<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>*</strong> 3 = Minimal port assignment and address-sensitive filtering<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>*</strong> 4 = Minimal port assignment and port-sensitive filtering<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>*</strong> 5 = Aggressive port assignment and no filtering<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>*</strong> 6 = Aggressive port assignment and address-sensitive filtering<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>*</strong> 7 = Aggressive port assignment and port-sensitive filtering</p><p>When NAT interacts with Xbox Secure Networking Layer functionality, many of these categories behave similarly. Therefore, they can be grouped into three larger categories. These are represented by the following types, which are part of the XONLINE_NAT_TYPE enumeration.</p><p><strong>Description</strong></p><p>XONLINE_NAT_OPEN (categories 1-3)</p><p>Players behind an XONLINE_NAT_OPEN NAT usually can connect to or receive connections from all other types.</p><p>XONLINE_NAT_MODERATE (category 4)</p><p>Players behind an XONLINE_NAT_MODERATE NAT can usually connect to or receive connections from players behind an XONLINE_NAT_OPEN NAT or another XONLINE_NAT_MODERATE NAT. They cannot usually communicate with players behind an XONLINE_NAT_STRICT NAT.</p><p>XONLINE_NAT_STRICT (categories 5-7)</p><p>Players behind an XONLINE_NAT_STRICT type NAT can usually connect to or receive connections from players behind an XONLINE_NAT_OPEN NAT only.</p><p>When a user logs on to Xbox LIVE, Xbox 360 automatically runs tests to classify the type of network connection and determine the relevant<br />*XONLINE_NAT_TYPE*. First, it detects whether the address that is seen by Xbox LIVE servers is identical to the address that the client was assigned locally.</p><p>If the addresses are identical-if no address translation has occurred-the type is set to XONLINE_NAT_OPEN, and no further work is performed. If the addresses differ, clients connect to additional Xbox LIVE servers and detect whether ports are aggressively assigned, and whether there is port-sensitive filtering. These results determine the NAT type.</p><p>A NAT device that implements a Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) Internet Gateway Device behaves like category 2 (XONLINE_NAT_OPEN), for ports<br />that have been mapped. Therefore, when the logon process successfully creates a UPnP port mapping, the NAT type is assumed to be XONLINE_NAT_OPEN.</p></blockquote></div><p>Thanks again,</p><p>Max</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MaximumFish</strong> on 27 Jul 2009, 21:57)</p>

					<p>Not a real suggestion to your problem, but &quot;netstat-nat&quot; (available in the OpenWrt repos) is a useful tool that displays NAT connections and their port assignments, it might be useful in your testing.<br />&quot;conntrack&quot; (in package &quot;conntrack-tools&quot;) might be useful, too.</p><p>As for filtering, the stateful Linux connection tracking will almost surely be of &quot;Address and Port Sensitive Filtering&quot; type. Check with &quot;conntrack&quot;, just to be sure.</p>									</div>

					<p>We&#039;ve finally got it working through our new Stonegate firewall. After all that, all it took was a 10 minute dabble with the settings.</p><p>Thanks anyway though, everyone. Sorry about the false alarm!</p>									</div>

					<p>a bit late to the party, but this will be helpful for anyone who needs to get a &quot;strict nat&quot;</p><p>i had the same issue as the OP (strict nat bugs needing fixed) but solved it a different way (couldnt get the firewall)</p><p>we managed to get a strict nat by routing through a windows 2000 pro (or server, we used pro) machine. no special settings apart from enabling routing in the registry and enabling internet connection sharing</p><p>hope this helps</p><p>cheers</p>									</div>
