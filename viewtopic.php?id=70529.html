					<p>The vnstat package, by default, only logs to RAM, which means it doesn&#039;t write to flash at all (this also means that all values are lost over a reboot).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>slh</strong> on 9 Apr 2017, 21:13)</p>

					<p>No, everything under /var and /tmp is on a RAM disk (tmpfs).&nbsp; It is in the RAM chip.&nbsp; Writing a file there does not affect the flash chip at all.&nbsp; But it will be lost when power is cut off or the router is rebooted.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 9 Apr 2017, 23:13)</p>

					<p>I guess I&#039;ve been a bit confused about what gets written/read using flash. I thought everything in /tmp for example is flash, temporary, RAM basically while the build is in ROM, permanent.</p>									</div>
