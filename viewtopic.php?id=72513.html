					<p>Look near the yellow RJ45 jack<br />There is some 4 pin unsoldered header.<br />This look like some serial line.</p><p>Try to figure out which pins are GND, TX, RX and maybe 3,3 Volts.</p><p>Use some 4 pin USB to serial adapter.</p><p>NOTE/IMPORTANT<br />Don&#039;t attach the red wire from the usb serial adapter.<br />There are 5 Volts which will damage your board.</p>									</div>
