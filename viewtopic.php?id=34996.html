					<p>Dear all,</p><p>Currently I&#039;m running Openwrt on my TP-Link WR1043ND.<br />Since my ISP want&#039;s me to use theire modem with a build in router which can not be bridged, I&#039;m using the TP-Link router as a AP to extend my wireless network.</p><p>I already installed the cifs package so I&#039;m able to mount my drives on my Windows server. (it is now mounted to my /mnt/Fileserver)<br />Furthermore I like these files by means of FTP server.<br />Therefore I installed the vsftp package.</p><p>Allthough there&#039;s I quite some information on this topic on the internet I can not figure it (yet)</p><p>All I want is to add a user and give it access to my /mnt/Fileserver mount.<br />There must be no anonymous login.<br />Furthermore I want to have the possibility to change the FTP port 21 to a higher port number to mislead the standard portscanners&nbsp; </p><p>Since I&#039;m already behind a router I have to open port 21 on my ISP router, I&#039;m not sure if I have to do this also on my TP-Link.<br />My guess is that this is not neccessery since there is no routing invloved.</p><p>Can you help to setup my vsftp.conf file and to add a new user to the Openwrt system.</p>									</div>
