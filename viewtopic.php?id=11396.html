					<p>It&#039;s amazing what happens if you go searching Amazon.com for the word &quot;OpenWrt&quot;; it seems that we&#039;re mentioned in a few publications. I really wasn&#039;t expecting much, and indeed the first publication is nothing more than a footnote in &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Hacking-Projects-Wi-Fi-Enthusiasts/dp/193183637X/">Wireless Hacking: Projects for Wi-Fi Enthusiasts</a>&quot; from 2004, but then things got interesting: &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Roomba-ExtremeTech-Tod-Kurt/dp/0470072717/">Hacking Roomba: ExtremeTech</a>&quot; from 2006 seems to have a section on OpenWrt -- I&#039;m confused.</p><p>The latest in this trifica seems to be the just-now-released &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Linksys-WRT54G-Ultimate-Hacking-Asadoorian/dp/1597491667/">Linksys WRT54G Ultimate Hacking</a>&quot; which claims &quot;Full coverage on embedded device development using the WRT54G and OpenWRT&quot;. Spiffy.</p>									</div>
