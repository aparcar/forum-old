					<p>Hello,<br />I&#039;ve installed Kamikadze 8.09.1 on my WRT54GL and have experienced a strange problem: when I&#039;m trying to connect my PC (Intel PRO/100VE onboard LAN on 865 chipset), I receive address by DHCP, but there are no responses to pings, DNS requests or whatever. Moreover, I recieve address during reboot/enabling interface, but ipconfig /renew fails with message &quot;Unable to contact DHCP server&quot;.<br />Well, actually I changed settings a bit, but it (my changes) is barely the reason for such strange behaviour: from notebook I perfectly see router either via wifi or cable (the same physical cable connected to same router&#039;s port that I tried to use with PC).<br />Can please somebody help me to solve this? Searching solution in google brought nothing and I&#039;m completely stuck at the moment...</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I found out the problem source finally... Surely it was nothing common neither with router nor with OpenWrt. After flashing OpenWrt my home subnet addressing was changed to (default) 192.168.1.0/24 and legacy persistent route (which I made about a year ago to access LAN on my work over VPN -- with the same default 192.168.1.0/24 address space) came to play...</p>									</div>
