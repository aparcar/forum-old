					<p>Hi all--</p><p>Feeling a little bored today, I decided to poke around with my 54g.&nbsp; Pulling /proc/pci over to another linux box, and running lspci against it shows me 2 usb devices that caught my eye...</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>00:03.0 USB Controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM47xx Sentry5 USB Device Controller (rev 01)
00:04.0 USB Controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM47xx Sentry5 USB Host Controller (rev 01)</code></pre></div><p>Intrigued, I installed the usbcore and usb-ohci modiules...&nbsp; Both of which loaded cleanly, and spit some output via dmesg:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>usb.c: registered new driver usbdevfs

					<p>yes I have the storage modules loaded and I get the same errors after reboot..... and my connector on the board is 12 pin, however i just grabbed a usb dongle from an old motherboard and its only got a 10pin connector?! maybe 2 or are unused on the board? or maybe im missing something</p>									</div>

					<p>The Broadcom BCM47xx/5325 chips the WRT54G(S) units are based on do indeed contain an internal USB port, but its not implemented on the board.

Yep, same hardware, different boards.</p><p>The Belkin 7230-4 is again the same platform, but does have a better spot on the board where a USB port should go.
