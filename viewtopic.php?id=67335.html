					<p>I am looking for a portable travel router with mesh support. The best would be if the router is batterypowered, but powered by USB is good too!</p><p>I would like to use it for a mesh/ad-hoc network. In this case it is so to provide a relatively stable connection to, eventually, a single router. This must be without the need for a public network like 4G or GPRS. Can you guys help me out?</p>									</div>

					<p><a href="http://www.gl-inet.com/mifi/">http://www.gl-inet.com/mifi/</a> is available in various configs, which include a battery option. It is delivered with OpenWrt and a custom GL.iNet GUI in addition to LuCi.&nbsp; The latest SW (2.21) has WDS included, though this GL.iNet firmware is still beta.&nbsp; Not sure if it&#039;s also in the delivered 2.20.&nbsp; </p><p>Its an Atheros 9331 based unit. I think for WDS you want a solution that has a chipset that is the same as the rest of your network, so not sure this is &quot;best&quot;</p>									</div>

					<p>802.11s is not the same as WDS<br />That said. From my experience 802.11S requires something with &gt;4M flash or a custom build. If you want encrypted 802.11s then Atheros appears to work ok but i&#039;ve had no success with ralink encrypted 802.11s</p>									</div>

I posted up about issues with it at the time (search on 802.11s)<br />I think I ended using various CC and trunk versions.</p><p>Without checking, I don&#039;t think the older WR841 has enough flash storage as is, so extroot and/or maybe the newer ones have bigger flash.</p>									</div>
