					<p>Hi there,</p><p>I&#039;m often downloading Linux distros such as Debian and Ubuntu. It&#039;s also often convenient to do so using a torrent client, due to the size of some of the files. Deluge has become my preferred client because it&#039;s the only one I&#039;ve been able to get working were I am. So, I was wondering if it&#039;s possible to get it &quot;reinstated&quot; in OpenWrt ?</p><p>The past problem seems to have been that rblibtorrent was broken in OpenWrt - <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/bittorrent">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/bittorrent</a> - &quot;6888 deluge needs rblibtorrent, which is broken and won&#039;t probably be fixed anytime soon&quot;. The reason seems to be a dependency on libboost which had become broken. It seems that libboost and therefore rblibtorrent has now been fixed - <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/6880">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/6880</a></p><p>If the problem is fixed, then - How do we get deluge/libboost/rdlibtorrent back in OpenWrt ?</p><p>Cheers</p><p>Don Charisma</p>									</div>
