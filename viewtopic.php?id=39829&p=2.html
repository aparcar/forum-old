					<p>I have no previous experience with this technique, but I would try to include the PCB into transparent resin to fix it on the milling machine, so even if the thickness goes very low, it will stay rigid enough.</p><p>Then the tricky part will be to have the PCB flat relative to the tool itself, so you have a chance to expose the full layers one by one at once....</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Squonk</strong> on 4 Dec 2012, 15:51)</p>

					<p>Here are some photos about the grinding process:</p><br /><p>The PCB is glued on a wood block with double sided adhesive tape. The two small pieces are from an old PCB and help to stabilize the block on the belt sander. They should be at least as thick as the middle PCB.<br /><a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/255/pcbgrinding02.jpg/"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://imageshack.us/a/img255/332/pcbgrinding02.th.jpg" alt="http://imageshack.us/a/img255/332/pcbgrinding02.th.jpg" /></span></a></p><br /><p>The belt sander is used with two different belts. A rough and a fine one.<br /><a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/401/pcbgrinding06.jpg/"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://imageshack.us/a/img401/5811/pcbgrinding06.th.jpg" alt="http://imageshack.us/a/img401/5811/pcbgrinding06.th.jpg" /></span></a></p><br /><p>The support pieces are grinded down to the thickness of the middle PCB. This is done with the rough belt.<br /><a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/841/pcbgrinding08.jpg/"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://imageshack.us/a/img841/1089/pcbgrinding08.th.jpg" alt="http://imageshack.us/a/img841/1089/pcbgrinding08.th.jpg" /></span></a></p><br /><p>Move on until the next copper layer becomes visible. Use only slight pressure and be patient. This takes some time.<br /><a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/62/pcbgrinding09.jpg/"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://imageshack.us/a/img62/1131/pcbgrinding09.th.jpg" alt="http://imageshack.us/a/img62/1131/pcbgrinding09.th.jpg" /></span></a></p><br /><p>Switch to the fine belt as soon as the first parts of the next copper layer become visible. Especially monitor the corners. Use the fine belt until the copper layer starts to become damaged. Monitor the corners again.<br /><a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/9/pcbgrinding10.jpg/"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://imageshack.us/a/img9/3153/pcbgrinding10.th.jpg" alt="http://imageshack.us/a/img9/3153/pcbgrinding10.th.jpg" /></span></a></p><br /><p>The process can&#039;t be finished on the belt sander. Stop using it as soon as the copper layer starts to get damaged. Take care to not bend the PCB too much when removing it from the wood block. Move on with manual grinding and two or three different types of sand papers. You can generate pressure on the PCB with two fingers at the exact position where you need to remove some material. The last sand paper is very fine and used for polishing.<br /><a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/854/pcbgrinding12.jpg/"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://imageshack.us/a/img854/5349/pcbgrinding12.th.jpg" alt="http://imageshack.us/a/img854/5349/pcbgrinding12.th.jpg" /></span></a></p><br /><p>Alternatively keep the PCB on the wood block and move the sand paper instead of the PCB. This way it&#039;s a little bit easier to grind at a specific location but it takes more time.<br /><a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/24/pcbgrinding14.jpg/"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://imageshack.us/a/img24/7476/pcbgrinding14.th.jpg" alt="http://imageshack.us/a/img24/7476/pcbgrinding14.th.jpg" /></span></a><a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/203/pcbgrinding15.jpg/"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://imageshack.us/a/img203/1276/pcbgrinding15.th.jpg" alt="http://imageshack.us/a/img203/1276/pcbgrinding15.th.jpg" /></span></a><a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/402/pcbgrinding16.jpg/"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://imageshack.us/a/img402/5194/pcbgrinding16.th.jpg" alt="http://imageshack.us/a/img402/5194/pcbgrinding16.th.jpg" /></span></a><a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/834/pcbgrinding17.jpg/"> <span class="postimg"><img src="http://imageshack.us/a/img834/9773/pcbgrinding17.th.jpg" alt="http://imageshack.us/a/img834/9773/pcbgrinding17.th.jpg" /></span></a></p>									</div>
