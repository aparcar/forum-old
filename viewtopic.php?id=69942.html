					<p>We use OpenWRT on a mobile Client-Device. The mobile&nbsp; client device is used in an environment with multiple access points. But, we can&#039;t access the APs. We are stuck with their configuration. At the moment we have the problem that our Client does not switch toward the best/closest AP. I&#039;ve read about 802.11r, but it seems like it requires for an AP configuration. Is there any measure I can solely apply to the client in order to improve the current situation?</p>									</div>
