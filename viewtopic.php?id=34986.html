					<p>Hi guys.</p><p>I have a number of the above that I have been using as serial to ethernet bridges for a little sensor project. I am running r24038 with the Luci front end but decided to upgrade to the recommended r29614 that is recommended here <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr741nd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr741nd</a> . (the squashfs, sysupgrade version)</p><p>I did the upgrade via the Luci interface and all seemed to go well and after about 2 mins it stated &#039;rebooting&#039;. It then sat like that for 10+ mins, so I then power cycled. I cant now reach the router either with SSH or via HTTP, either on its original set IP 192.168.119.x or back on the default 192.168.1.1.</p><p>I have noted that the &#039;gears&#039; light is flashing steadily on boot, but the wireless and LAN port lights don&#039;t now react. I cant ping it either.</p><p>Have I toasted it? If you any ideas what I did wrong for such a seemingly simple upgrade? Am I into serial cable and TFTP territory now?</p><p>Thanks in advance for any assistance.</p>									</div>

					<p>did you flashed the lastest trunk from snapshot folder?</p><p>if so, there&#039;s not gui, you should do the initial config from telnet and install luci:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/firstlogin">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/firstlogin</a></p><p>or eventually try to failsafe:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr741nd#failsafe.mode">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl- … lsafe.mode</a></p><br /><p>anyway, i don&#039;t understand where did you find your previous image r24038 with luci...</p>									</div>

					<p>It wasnt the latest snapshot, it was specifically r29614 that was referenced on the TP741nd wiki page. Should I be assuming that latest supercedes any earlier ones proven to work (ie 100% backwards compatibility).</p><p>I want clear originally- of course Luci wont work (yet) but I was expecting ping / telnet / SSH. I can&#039;t get ant of those, and the sys light flashes continually, rather than stopping and staying steady as it does on my other working 741&#039;s.</p><p>I tried failsafe, but the QSS button made no difference to LED flash speed and telnet was still not usable. Holding reset during boot gives a faster flash - I&#039;m assuming this is TFTP mode being activated and I will need to set up a TFTP server to be able to get anywhere from here?</p><br /><p>(UPDATE)</p><p>By continually pinging using ping -t -w 10 192.168.1.1 there is a brief window on power up when the unit responds. TFTPing then using tftp -i 192.168.1.1 PUT file.bin times out. Alternatively, holding down reset on boot then releasing gives me &#039;fast flash&#039; on the sys LED and&nbsp; the router continually then responds to ping - BUT the tftp still times out. Am I correct in thinking the TFTP server on the router should be running at this time?</p><p>Thanks for your help, much appreciated.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>warwick</strong> on 25 Feb 2012, 12:12)</p>

					<p>it&#039;s really strange that when you get fast SYS flash you cannot &quot;telnet 192.168.1.1&quot;, while it responds to ping!!!</p><p>BTW you flashed TRUNK image, the build varies every few day, it was NOT the one written in wiki!!</p><p>look at the NOTES in the first column of the fist table, on trunk it&#039;s written r29XXX</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr741nd#installation">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl- … stallation</a></p><p>and &quot;Release number vary more frequently than Wiki update&quot;</p>									</div>

					<p>Solved: I could telnet in then the ping responded, i was then able to mount the partitions, do a firstboot, then set a telnet password, access via SSH and then load Luci (but see later)</p><p>I *didnt* reload any firmware - so I&#039;m not actually sure what I did wrong initially or what I did to fix it?</p><p>I can now access the router and pass traffic fine, having configured via Luci. I even have a little embedded processor talking down a serial line and sending commands - so all is well (well apart from killing Luci somehow - see other thread!)</p><p>Thanks Nebbia88 for your interest and help!</p>									</div>
