					<p>My device is 99% similar to this:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/cisco/epc3825">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/cisco/epc3825</a></p><p>I am new to OpenWrt but I am not new to programming. <br />I have built OpenWrt.<br />I can read the bootlog from my device via UART.<br />I have a console shell via SSh or Telnet to my device. I have access to Flash and Non-Vol from the console.<br />I can upload firmware to the device no problem over tftp.<br />I have two different versions of the original firmware which I have unpacked.</p><p>The question is this cpu has no known source code available, but it is similar to the bm63xx CPU&#039;s, which OpenWrt is supporting.<br />I think the only thing missing for the bmc33xx would be the docisis or DSl driver support, but that is fine for now.</p><p>My question is how, where do I start to develop in OpenWrt for this CPU, can I use an existing&nbsp; bm63xx port in OpenWrt and adapt to my needs?<br />Am I dreaming to make this work? </p><p>I am not asking for my hand to be held, just a shove in the right direction.</p><p>I have read <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/add.new.device,">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/add.new.device,</a> and various other pages in the wiki and also some forum posts but nothing is available for my situation.</p><p>This is just a side thought, would it be possible in the future to get the DSL driver working?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>slayeruk</strong> on 22 Oct 2014, 02:38)</p>
