Sorry that I have tons of questions and hopefully didn&#039;t bother you too much!</p></blockquote></div><p>@clancom <br />The fist connection setup you mentioned is correct. You need to connect your pc with static ip address like 192.168.1.2 straight with a cable to WR703N&#039;s etherenet port.</p><p>When WR703N is in failsafe mode (fast flashing led light) it will assign itself an ip of 192.168.1.1 and you can telnet that ip address from your pc. </p><p>As James pointed out please disable your firewall if possible just in case it blocks the apache&#039;s port 80. Please also make sure that apache is working on your pc by opening <a href="http://192.168.1.2/">http://192.168.1.2/</a> from your pc and you should see a &quot;It works&quot; page.</p><p>After you logged into (via telnet) WR703N. Run the following commands one by one:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cd /tmp/
wget http://192.168.1.2/FIRMWARENAME</code></pre></div><p>Assume you have set your pc&#039;s ip address 192.168.1.2 and replace FIRMWARENAME by what ever the filename you copied to your apache&#039;s folder.</p><p>If the wget reports no error you can then start flashing the firmware as mentioned in my previous post.</p><p>The firmware I created does not have any ability to broadcast its name/services over network. Therefore the WR841N you saw on your pc has nothing to do with it.&nbsp; If for some reason that WR703N cannot be accessed from http://nas/&nbsp; (blame your router for that) then you will need to use ip address to access it, which usually can be found on the &quot;dhcp client list&quot; (refer to your router&#039;s documents) and remember to cross check the mac address printed on the back of the WR703N.</p>									</div>

You probably can flash my firmware on MR11U. If it does not work you can always recover it with TTL.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>s7mx1</strong> on 9 Jan 2012, 13:46)</p>

The time to extract that tar ball on WR703N is very long (5-10 minutes on nfs share) though I can literately extract it within seconds on a machine with very weak atom.
