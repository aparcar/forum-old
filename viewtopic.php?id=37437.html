					<p>While working on a new version of my tool Bluelog (<a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/packages/utils/bluelog">https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/packages/utils/bluelog</a>), I&#039;ve found that after running a few inquiry scans, BlueZ seems to get jammed up. At that point, trying to do things like &quot;hcitool scan&quot; or &quot;hciconfig -a&quot; will result in an error:</p><p>hcitool returns:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Scanning...
Inquiry failed: Connection timed out</code></pre></div><p>hciconfig -a shows:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Can&#039;t read local name on hci0: Connection timed out (110)</code></pre></div><p>I can get things working again by pulling out the Bluetooth adapter and reinserting it, but the error comes back eventually.</p><p>My TP-LINK MR3220 running a snapshot from ~4 months ago does <strong>not</strong> have this problem; it only occurs on my TP-LINK WR703N running the June 9th snapshot.</p><p>Can anyone with a Bluetooth adapter confirm this issue on trunk? Installing the build of Bluelog from the repos (1.0.3) and running it for a few minutes seems to trigger the problem 100%, though hammering &quot;hcitool scan&quot; enough times has done it for me as well.</p>									</div>
