					<p>Is there a way to configure OpenVPN using Luci and an ovpn file.&nbsp; The only way I have been able to see that one can use the ovpn file, is to start the VPN from the command line using the ovpn file. Or struggling through stripping the file down to it&#039;s pieces (key, cert, ca, and individual options) and entering them manually.&nbsp; It seems that if OpenVPN designed this file for ease of use, it should make it easy to use!&nbsp; I must be missing something.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>baxterdmutt</strong> on 6 May 2016, 06:56)</p>

					<p>Ok, I kinda figured this out.&nbsp; First let me say that the Wiki&#039;s on Openwrt to do with Openvpn are out of date and missing key ingredients for newbies like me.<br />1) It looks like OpenVPN no longer uses the /etc/openvpn/ directory as the default config directory and nor does it recognize .conf or .ovpn files.&nbsp; The (only) config file is /etc/config/openvpn.&nbsp; It needs to be formatted like this:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option dev tun<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option persist_key 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;etc.<br />The old way that I read about using a conf file would have just had:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dev tun<br />Openwrt Chaos Calmer just ignores that format.</p><p>2)Chaos Calmer does not install the openvpn-openssl package when the openvpn is installed.&nbsp; I think it should be a dependency because nothing works without it. For example without the openvpn-openssl package the &#039;/etc/init.d/openvpn enable&#039; command returns a not found error unless openssl is installed.&nbsp; The /etc/config/openvpn example config file does not exist without openvpn-openssl.</p><p>You do have to strip any of the certificates and keys out of the ovpn file as well and create .key and .crt files and Luci puts them here by default:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option key &#039;/lib/uci/upload/cbid.openvpn.-your-.key&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option cert &#039;/lib/uci/upload/cbid.openvpn.-your-.cert&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ca &#039;/lib/uci/upload/cbid.openvpn.-your-.ca&#039;<br />It was a pain finding them (for a newbie) because Luci doesn&#039;t give a hint and the wiki and even the openvpn config file that openvpn-openssl gives suggests they are in /etc/openvpn. But nothing is there unless you create the directory yourself and put stuff there.&nbsp; </p><p>Hopefully the 2 days of my life that are now gone can be of some help to other newbies trying to follow out of date wiki pages <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

Either the wiki is out of date for Chaos Calmer or it&#039;s not running as it should (seems unlikely because everything is working fine now that I have everything installed properly). Putting a valid .ovpn file in the /etc/Openvpn directory and renaming it a .conf does nothing. I have a working system, so I know the config I transcribed into the /etc/config/Openvpn file works. If I take the .opvn (which incidentally works on my Openvpn app on my Mac and iPhones and put it in that directory and rename it, I get the same results as if I&#039;d put nothing there.</p>									</div>

					<p>So in the interest of figuring this out,&nbsp; I&#039;ve uninstalled luci-Openvpn-app, Openvpn-OpenSSL and removed all my config files and the /etc/Openvpn directory I created. Then I reinstalled both apps<br />The /etc/openvpn directory was not created on a new install so I created it myself and put the .ovpn file there and renamed it .conf. Luci does not see the configuration. I checked the privileges and they were 644 so I changed to 777 and luci still sees nothing. I restarted the router and still nothing. So what am I to think. Can you point me to the wiki that says changing .ovpn to .conf works. Maybe I&#039;m missing something. Although I can&#039;t see what.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>baxterdmutt</strong> on 7 May 2016, 18:46)</p>
