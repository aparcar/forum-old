					<p>Hi all</p><p>AFAIK this question has not been raised before: are there any plans to produce a custom firmware for the Netgear MBRN3000 3G+ router ?</p><p><a href="http://www.netgear.com.au/home/products/mobile-broadband/3g-mobile/MBRN3000.aspx">http://www.netgear.com.au/home/products â€¦ N3000.aspx</a></p><p>It has the Broadcom 6358 chip so there&#039;s a difficulty providing things like DSL support but since this router is 3G only, that ought not to be a problem.</p><p>Cheers<br />J</p>									</div>

					<p>Still interested to know whether this router is likely to get a firmware in future. I&#039;m not sure what I can do to influence that but it would be interesting to hear views.</p><p>Or, alternatively, if there&#039;s a page on this site that newcomers can view which gives advice on how to do this yourself (probably in outline I guess), that would be very helpful. In order to make a decision on whether to embark on this kind of project I think I would need to know:<br />- what development hardware is likely to be needed e.g. minimum 1 linux PC<br />- how much time is likely to be involved<br />- how to determine if there are obvious show-stoppers with router ABC<br />- how much knowledge of inner workings of OpenWRT is required (and whether that&#039;s documented)<br />- whether soldering will be required (I&#039;ve seen documentation on this for when it is required)<br />- &lt;add here&gt; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>It&#039;s a real newcomer&#039;s post, I know !<br />Cheers<br />jeq</p>									</div>

					<p>Started to find lots of useful detailed information now. I guess the most important discovery is that there&#039;s more than one way in which a new firmware can be developed.</p><p>In a thread on this forum about a year ago another router with the 6358 chip was discussed. It was the ct-6373. <br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=34707">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=34707</a></p><p>The OP wanted to know if an OpenWRT f/w would ever be available. Just a few months later it was all done and dusted. And at least one other forum user has since flashed their router with the image. At that time (it seems) nobody other than the OP had physical access to the ct-6373 hardware.</p><p>Some information about the MBRN3000 which might be helpful :<br />CFE board ID : 1.0.37-102.9<br />source:&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=35153">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=35153</a><br />(this person was referring to DGN2200v1 I think)<br />Flash chip: (maybe) Macronix MX29LV640DBTC-90G<br />source:&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://wikidevi.com/wiki/Netgear_DGN2200v1">http://wikidevi.com/wiki/Netgear_DGN2200v1</a><br />(I wish to confirm this brand)<br />For info, the wikidev for MBRN3000 is here :<br /><a href="http://www.wikidevi.com/wiki/Netgear_MBRN3000">http://www.wikidevi.com/wiki/Netgear_MBRN3000</a><br />Flash is 8MB, RAM is 32MB (but actual chips not named)</p><p>I haven&#039;t opened up my router but if that&#039;s necessary maybe that&#039;s what needs to happen.<br />All help appreciated !<br />J</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jeq</strong> on 3 Mar 2013, 22:37)</p>
