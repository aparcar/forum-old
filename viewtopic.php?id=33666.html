					<p>Hello All,</p><p>I am looking to get some guidance and then help as I determine which sound setup would suit my situation best and then proceed to set it up.</p><p>My goal is to be able to listen to the same audio(syncâ€™ed) throughout three rooms.&nbsp; One of the rooms has an Ethernet line going into it, and the other two do not.&nbsp; Two of the rooms already have an amplifier and speakers so I thought taping into the amplifier would be ideal.</p><p>I am aware that Sonos does have a good solution for my dilemma but I think that they are a bit pricey and I am not quite sure of which boxes I would need to get.</p><p>My initial thought was to use pulseaudio to send the audio via rtp and receive the stream on either netbooks or an openwrt router with a usb soundcard.&nbsp; I would then plug that into my amplifiers.&nbsp; After a little experimentation with a netbook and my desktop, I was able to get this to work with the netbook as the receiver.&nbsp; Unfortunately the audio quality was very choppy, and dropped every second or so.&nbsp; I did find that if I plugged the netbook into the router things worked perfectly.&nbsp; I am still exploring this option but am also looking for another.</p><p>So, I was wondering if I could use mpd and possibly a few openwrt routers (with usb soundcards) to solve my problem.&nbsp; I have never used MPD before, but after reading some forum posts from others who wanted to accomplish similar tasks, I got a little hope.</p><br /><br /><p>I also have stumbled upon a project called USB-IP<br /><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/usbip/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/usbip/</a></p><p>I am curious if anyone has set this up so that a 520gu router acts as the usb server</p><p>Does anyone know whether this is possible? Simple? Worth while?&nbsp; Any other thoughts are welcome, Thanks!</p>									</div>
