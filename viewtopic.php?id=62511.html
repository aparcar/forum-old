					<p>I was thinking about adding &quot;a OpenWrt recipes&quot; page in the wiki where someone with experience (or anyone really) could put down a bunch of lists of packages needed to make images with imagebuilder in a way to make firmwares that have the usual flash chip mb sizes.</p><p>As it is now, making a firmware is mostly down to guesswork and trial-and-error to figure out if I can fit &quot;my favourite list of packages&quot; in X mb of flash size, which is tedious as %$££, even while the autobuild/image-maker tools make this a pretty easy and painless process from the compilation side of things.</p><p>Like the one you find in the extroot (root swap page), about a VERY minimal image to get a working firmware that can extroot.<br />( <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/extroot">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/extroot</a> )</p><p>An example list:</p><p>&quot;recommended 4mb wifi-router firmware&quot;</p><p>&quot;recommended 4mb firmware for extroot&quot;</p><p>&quot;recommended 8mb wifi-router firmware with X but without Y&quot; (for example: a more media-oriented firmware)</p><p>&quot;recommended 8mb wifi-router firmware with Y but without X&quot; (another example: a more hardcore-networking firmware with wifi mesh and whatever)</p><p>Also &quot;modules&quot; like &quot;+8mb of filesharing and downloaders by user1&quot; (assorted to the liking of &quot;user1&quot;), or &quot;+6mb linux filesystems and utilities&quot;, that are modules added on top of an already working firmware.</p><p>Doing something like this is more flexible and free than just making a ton of different or maybe conflicting metapackages like I&#039;ve seen with some of the more obvious stuff (USB) where it actually makes sense.</p><p>This wiki page would mimick a bit dd-wrt&#039;s own page you can see here, where they standardized things much more. <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/What_is_%22DD-WRT%22%3F#K2.6_Build_Features">http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Wh … d_Features</a></p><p>Ah, this would also help out a lot people that want to buy a router and aren&#039;t already OpenWRT gurus.</p>									</div>
