					<p>I&#039;m in Taiwan.&nbsp; I just purchased what appears to be the preferred WL500Gp (version 1) just to get started with OpenWrt.</p><p>Logically, Asus didn&#039;t include V1 in the label as they didn&#039;t anticipate there would ever be a V2.</p><p>I have researching visual identification and there is some indication that I must open the box and void the warranty in order to confirm I have the right Wifi chip.&nbsp; </p><p>On the other hand, I have had some indication that the V2 has BOTH a different box layout and that by merely reading the additional V2 of the FCC label or its absence, I can confirm which I have.</p><p>The V2 boxes I&#039;ve seen have a diagonal venting rather on top rather than the rectangular array of holes with Asus in the center.</p><p>My FCC label reads &#039;FCC ID MSQWL500GP&#039; , but I have seen &#039;FCC ID MSQWL500GPV2&#039; lables by Googling &#039;WL500gpv2 image&#039;.</p><p>The backsides appear to be different as well. Looking at the back of the unit, I have a red button, two USB ports [over and under] and a black button.&nbsp; This seems to indicate a V1.&nbsp; On the V2, the buttons are to the left of WAN port.&nbsp; V2 appears to have the antenna on the left while V1 appears to have it on the right.</p><p>At this point, I&#039;d rather not open the box and move on with loading new firmware.&nbsp; So, did I get this right? Or must I really open the box to find out?</p>									</div>

					<p>I have happily resolved that I indeed have a V1.&nbsp; If you see the package in a retail outlet, it will merely be labled WL500 Premium without any indication of version.&nbsp; If you see Version 2 in the package, that is clearly labled on the front of the package.</p><p>Version one package shows the antenna of the left side in the picture on the package.&nbsp; While version two shows the antenna on the right side in the picture on its package.</p>									</div>
