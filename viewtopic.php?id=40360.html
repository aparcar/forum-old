					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;ve been reading through the forums on how to setup Tor and i&#039;m getting myself a little confused, so i&#039;m hoping some kind people out there will help me understand the process more clearly.</p><p>Firstly i have a TP-Link TL-WR1043ND Firmware Version OpenWrt Barrier Breaker r33993 / LuCI Trunk (trunk+svn9413) Kernel Version 3.3.8 </p><p>My setup is as follows :-&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;PC&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ---&gt; WR1043ND (OPenWRT)&nbsp; &nbsp;----&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;ADSL router&nbsp; &nbsp;-------&gt;&nbsp; Internet<br />(DHCP)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(192.168.1.1)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(192.168.1.2)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>I would like all connections through the OpenWrt router to be forced through Tor Network to hide my ip, weather it be LAN wired connection on Wireless connection.

					<p>Wow i&#039;m just blown away by the levels of support from this supposed community.............not 1 person willing to help ? So much for community spirit...... It&#039;s not even like i&#039;m just another newbie who has asked for help without reading other posts, i&#039;ve at least had a try at what i think the config might be, and was just asking for a little guidance.</p><p>I had hight hopes for OpenWrt, but it seems like it&#039;s all been a complete waste of time and money now...... Thanks....</p>									</div>
