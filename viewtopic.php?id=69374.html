					<p>There is no reason they shouldn&#039;t work simultaneously.&nbsp; The two radio systems are in separate chips.</p><p>You need to use a firmware that matches your ath10k version somewhat closely.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />I&#039;m struggeling with the same problem as OP. I updated the packagemanager and installed kmod-ath10k as instructed on the routers wiki page. Did iw list as suggested by mk42, and tried different channels/dBms that went toghether. Still no activity on the 5ghz.. </p><p>I was actually intending to buy a new router because I had a lot of troubles with this one. I tried a lot of configuring with the original firmware with no luck. After I installed openwrt, the router at 2,4ghz is much more stable then it ever was with Netgears firmware (been testing openwrt for 24 hrs or so), If I just could get the 5ghz up and running it would really be great. I haven&#039;t used any unix based systems for years, so debugging is a bit difficult. The web GUI is good, but seems like I have to get my hands dirty and SSHing in to fix this (as I see others here have done). I do have some basic network understanding, but any help here would be greatly appreciated,</p>									</div>
