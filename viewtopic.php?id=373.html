					<p>Some WRT54G V2 have 32MB of Ram, but it will only recognise 16MB of Ram (probably for firmware compatibility). It looks like the Ram size is hardcoded into the bootloader (cfe/pmon). Is there any way to enable the full 32MB of Ram?</p>									</div>

					<p>The ram size is determined atleast partially by the sdram_* variables in nvram. Setting these variables wrong will prevent cfe from booting, even to the point of recovery. The result is a bricked WRT54GV2 -- it&#039;s been tried.</p><p>A better strategy would be to extract the ram initialization code from cfe and run it again after bootup, which would allow you to safely play with ram options without breaking cfe. It&#039;s entirely possible that the ram isn&#039;t even wired to allow access to the full capacity.</p>									</div>

(two 512Mx16). But my question are:<br />- Does the Broadcom BCM47x2 do support this? <br />- What is the maximum what the chip can adress?<br />- I there a signalisation on the board which inform the chip how much memory could be used (like in SDRAM modules of your PC)<br />- Does the length of the &quot;words&quot; changed by adressing more memory?<br />Is there any tools to run on the box to get more information about the memory? like:<br /><a href="http://www.pl-berichte.de/work/tuning/dimm.html">http://www.pl-berichte.de/work/tuning/dimm.html</a><br />But /proc/sys/dev/sensors/ will only exist when the kernel has the module &quot;lm_sensors&quot;. Any other ways to get more informations about the RAM?</p><p>Greetings, rob</p><p>PS: &quot;Avenger 2.0&quot; or sombody else, could you please publish a photo of the board with 32 MB?</p>									</div>

					<p>The SDRAM chips used is addressed with 16 bit, but as you may know SDRAM chips use address multiplexing with row/column addressing to select a specific word. <br />It is usually up to the CPU at a very early stage (assembler in bootloader) to set the correct row/column parameters in the SDRAM controller..</p><p>On a normal PC the SDRAM module contains a small EEPROM with <br />the correct memory parameters, these are the values read by the BIOS as startup as well as displayed by the lm_sensors package. </p><p>Without any Broadcom datasheet and info about their SDRAM controller I would say that it is very hard to get another memory chip to work.</p><p>The following nvram variables on the WRT54GS could perhaps be&nbsp; of interest to you if you&#039;re still not convinced.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>sdram_config=0x0022
