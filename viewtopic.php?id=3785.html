					<p>Hello.</p><p>I am currently running OpenWrt on a WRT54Gv2. I came across this very unique program known as &quot;cutter&quot;, which allows users to terminate specific TCP/IP connections routed over the router, and could be found here: <a href="http://www.cyberciti.biz/nixcraft/vivek/blogger/2005/12/cutting-tcpip-network-connection-with.php">http://www.cyberciti.biz/nixcraft/vivek â€¦ n-with.php</a> .</p><p>I don&#039;t know much about how the program works, but from what I read, it works on iptables based firewall routers, and it seems like a pretty useful tool, especially for OpenWrt. I was wondering if it was possible to get it working on OpenWrt.</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br />leetsauce</p>									</div>
