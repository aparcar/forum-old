					<p>You have to:<br />-Enable Wireless n/g<br />-Enable 40MHZ Fat Channel<br />-Enable No Scan<br />-Make sure the wireless adapter you are using is able to negotiate 300Mbps as well. NOT ALL Wireless N supports 300Mbps<br />Wireless N defines 150 per Transmit and Receive so your adapter needs to be 2 Transmit X 2 Receive to negotiate 300Mbps<br />1 Transmit X 1 Receive only negotiates 150Mbps</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>alphasparc</strong> on 11 Apr 2012, 06:37)</p>

There is a reason for this scan, so that one AP don&#039;t fill up the whole available spectrum at 2.4GHz (ok not the whole only 82%, but still too much). If 2,4 GHz is so crowded that is doesn&#039;t work with 40MHz without the &quot;no scan&quot; option there is a really good reason for it, and you won&#039;t be happy if your neighbor would use this option, either. </p><p>so it would be a good idea to figure why it can only use one stream before you show anti-social behaviour like the &quot;no scan&quot;-option. </p><p>what&#039;s the receiving device? laptop with build-in antennas? a usb-stick (with sticks it&#039;s often impossible to get more than 1 stream because the antennas are too close)<br />how near is the device. try a few meters, maybe with an obstacle in between. being too near isn&#039;t good for MIMO.&nbsp; </p><p>And sure you can try to set 40MHz (but please without &quot;no scan&quot;) but be aware that some wifi-cards don&#039;t allow 40MHz on 2,4GHz e.g. the intel 4695.</p>									</div>

					<p>Many thanks. I do agree with eleon, if I have wireless n/g enabled and 20MHz channel on the stock firmware, it does connect at 135 MBits. OpenWRT should be able to do the same thing. My wireless space is crowded, so trying for 2 channels (40MHz) is silly, so 2 statial streams @ 20MHz works well.</p><p>As for the receiving devices, I&#039;ve tried 2 laptops @ 1m, a desktop with two wireless antenna&#039;s @ 2m, and an HTC Incredible S. Nothing will connect over 65 MBits even though I&#039;ve had all running at 135MBits with stock firmware.

					<p>how do you test the connected speed? </p><p>if you want an accurate rate run &quot;iw wlan0 station dump&quot; on the router to see the connected clients and the&nbsp; brutto-bandwith and coding scheme for rx and tx you can check the datarate table here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11n-2009">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11n-2009</a> to see if its using 1 or 2 spatial streams (MCS 0-7 -&gt; 1 stream, MCS 8-15 -&gt; 2 streams)</p><p>And make sure that your client makes some (or better a lot of) traffic. If there is no or only litte traffic a slower MCS is used.

					<p>Theoretically, it should be capable. However remember WiFi certification, 802.11n interoperability, and general good practice requires devices to automatically switch off 40Mhz if it detects other access points in any part of the overlapping band. Which will be the vast majority of the time, unless you are in a very isolated environment.</p><p>OpenWrt obeys this by default as well, so more than likely it has switched off 40Mhz to avoid interfering with nearby access points.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>qasdfdsaq</strong> on 10 Jun 2014, 20:14)</p>
