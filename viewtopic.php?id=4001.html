					<p>They have to make available the sources for packages that are released under a license that requires the source to be available - read GPL. Reverse engineering the AirGo driver is possible, you just have to find someone who has the time and the knowledge to do it, and then find someone who can write the opensource driver based on the documentation created - read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_wall#Computer_science">Chinese wall</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design">Clean room design</a></p>									</div>

					<p>I recenly purchased a WRT54GX4 MIMO router. I thought it would useful to get a terminal into it (assuming it is running a Linux OS)<br />After cracking the case I noticed there&#039;s is port labeled JP1. </p><p>JP1 has 4 pins which I took a guess, this is a serial port. I have tried adding RS232 line drivers and several pinouts however no success.<br />Has anyone gone down this path?<br />Is this not a serial port? (suppose it could be JTAG, USB or may other things)<br />Is there a way to ssh into the router and get a shell prompt?</p><p>I also noticed the RTL8651B microcontroller which has two onboard UARTS (as well as a USB 1.1 host adapter)<br />My assumption the JP1 port is one of these ports.</p><p>Any help or experience would be appreciated.
