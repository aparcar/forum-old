					<p>Hi, I tried the above procedure with DIR-615, and hexedit and I still get the error message that it&#039;s the incorrect firmware. Sometimes I also get a lag response from the web interface which eventually times out or reports the incorrect firmware error. Both times orange light continues to flash with little activity on the wired connection.</p><p>Version E3 of the router.</p><p>Any ideas?? Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Can you post the link to your firmware? May be couple screen shots? I have 2 615E3 and running dd-wrt in WDS mode. I would like to run it in just repeater mode, but I can&#039;t do this in dd-wrt. Do you think I can do this with OpenWrt?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
