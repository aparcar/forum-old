					<p>Hello everyone, </p><p>I have a Sagem F@ast5350 GV, and the modem system it is based on OpenWrt Kamikaze, it uses a BCM63168 Soc. </p><p>The problem is that it comes with a very bad and very limited web-gui. </p><p>I have it Linux root access through the serial port, I realized that it seems to use uci, OPKG etc ... </p><p>My question is if I could add the path to the file opkg.conf compiled packages for the platform brcm63xx ? For example, I want to install the web-gui Luci. </p><p>Will it work? </p><p>Thanks it helps</p>									</div>
