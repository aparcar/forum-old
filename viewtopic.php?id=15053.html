					<p>Hi there! <br />I finished porting last Kamikaze trunk to the StorLink Gemini platform. I added again kernel 2.6.15 support to OpenWRT to keep our vendor-specific kernel patches. Now, i&#039;d like to release snapshots of binary firmware, packages and sources but i dont link putting them on an ftp server.</p><p>Is it possible to have these on official OpenWRT site?<br />Is it possible to integrate my patches on the Kamikaze trunk?</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>									</div>

					<p>In OpenWrt, we would prefer not adding new targets based on obsolete kernels. Could you try to port it to a newer kernel version, either 2.6.23 or 2.6.24?<br />If you don&#039;t have the bandwidth for serving the files, just send them to me and I&#039;ll mirror them somewhere.<br />Thanks,<br />- Felix</p>									</div>

					<p>i know that supporting older kernel is not nice, but i have no time to convert ugly vendor code to newer kernels. <br />but for how much time 2.6.23 will be kept and when discarded for a newer kernel?</p>									</div>
