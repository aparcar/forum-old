					<p>I am currently using a Draytek Vigor router, and wish to power it through a managed UPS.&nbsp; To save the expense of purchasing a ups with network port and/or management card, I decided that this may be a suitable task for a Raspberry Pi, running apcupsd.</p><p>I originally thought of installing ArchLinux for this purpose.&nbsp; However, I think that I might be able to us the Pi for some other services - particularly those that my current router doesn&#039;t handle too well:<br /> o A cacheing DNS server/relay<br /> o An NTP server/relay<br /> o A DHCP server<br /> o A PXE boot server</p><p>This led me to consider installing OpenWRT.</p><p>So, I downloaded the &#039;attitude adjustment&#039; Image Generator onto my Ubuntu desktop machine, and set about building a customised image.</p><p>However, even without adding any customisation, the &#039;make image PROFILE=RaspberryPi&#039; command fails.</p><p>I see the following reports at the end of the process:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Collected errors:

					<p>Okay, so I must be doing something wrong!</p><p>I download one of the images from the Attitude Adjustment release, for instance:<br />openwrt-brcm2708-sdcard-vfat-ext4_128.img, dated 03-Apr-2013</p><p>I&#039;m not clear why there are four different images:<br />openwrt-brcm2708-Image<br />openwrt-brcm2708-sdcard-vfat-ext4_128.img<br />openwrt-brcm2708-sdcard-vfat-ext4_192.img<br />openwrt-brcm2708-sdcard-vfat-ext4_224.img<br />.. something to do with the amount of memory assigned to the GPU?</p><p>So, on my Ununtu desktop, I use gparted to format a 4GB SD card as fat32 with an msdos partition table.&nbsp; This sdcard mounts on Ubuntu, and displays an empty file system, as device /dev/sdg1.</p><p>I then do <br />sudo dd bs=2M if=openwrt-brcm2708-sdcard-vfat-ext4_128.img of=/dev/sdg</p><p>This reports:<br />38+0 records in<br />38+0 records out<br />79691776 bytes (80 MB) copied, 0.806261 s, 98.8 MB/s</p><br /><p>I eject the SD card, place it in the SDCard slot on a RaspberryPi.</p><p>When I power up the Pi, it shows one red status LED and displays nothing on the connected hdmi screen.</p><p>If I power up with an identical SDcard, with RISC OS installed, all five status LEDs light or flicker, and the RO desktop is displayed.</p><p>Similarly, if I power up with a Raspbian, all five status LEDs light/flicker and the boot sequence displays.&nbsp; I can then login and reach the desktop with startx.</p><p>Why do I have no success with OpenWRT?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Peterb</strong> on 13 Mar 2014, 14:55)</p>

					<p>After a while experimenting with OpenWRT on the Raspberry Pi, I found that some of the packages I required simply weren&#039;t available for the build which I had running.</p><p>Judging by the lack of response here, not many have managed to achieve a working system.&nbsp; The one person who did respond (thank you Ramponis) offered an image which, apparently, works for him, but fails to boot on my devices.</p><p>I gave up and reverted to my original plan to set up ArchLinux - this went reasonably smoothly and I had all the functionality (apcupsd, dnsmasq [dns, dhcp, pxe], and ntp) I was looking for within a couple of hours.&nbsp; I am confident that if I wish to add further functionality in the future, this will be similarly trouble free.</p><p>That system has now been running my network for a week without any problems.</p><p>My conclusion is that OpenWRT for the Raspberry Pi simply isn&#039;t ready yet unless, perhaps, you are prepared to build everything from latest sources.&nbsp; Maybe, one day, it will be viable but, for the present, it is for the real OpenWRT enthusiasts only.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Peterb</strong> on 24 Mar 2014, 05:24)</p>
