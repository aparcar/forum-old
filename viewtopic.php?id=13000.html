					<p>Hi All</p><p>OK I&#039;m using Kam 7.09 on a wrt54g in a specific configuration and setup, this I think is then causing a problem with 20-ntpclient starting up.</p><p>I&#039;ve had a look at the script in /etc/hotplug.d/iface/20-ntpclient and (I&#039;m not a bash expert so I&#039;m trying to work it out) what&#039;s happening is that the script checks to see if the wan interface is up and connected and then (and only then) it runs ntpclient against the settings entered.</p><p>However my setup is unusual in that my wan interface is my wifi connection (I don&#039;t use the physical WAN connection on the router at all) and my ntp server is on my internal LAN.</p><p>So I think if I&#039;ve understood what&#039;s happening correctly is that during the reboot either because the WAN connection (physical) is not used or because the wifi connection is setup as the WAN connection and it&#039;s taking a while to come up (during which time 20-ntpclient says the iface is not up so I&#039;m bombing out) ntpclient doesn&#039;t start.&nbsp; Either way I&#039;m stuck.</p><p>If anyone could give me some advice as to how to change the 20-ntpclient script or an idea for how to work around the problem I&#039;d be grateful.....at the moment I&#039;m feeling very dumb!!</p><p>TIA</p>									</div>
