					<p>I am planning to hang cameras outside and about 2-3 inside, i tried extending the usb wires with cat cables. problem is that the distance is to much and they aren&#039;t recognized anymore.</p><p>I don&#039;t need like 20fps but at least 3-4fps will be enough, and even 3-4fps with 4 cams will be to much cpuload</p><p>So I was looking for a usb extender, and a router is the easiest option.

					<p>Be aware: Even with webcams that support mjpeg, you might run out of USB bandwidth when connecting multiple cams to your router, e.g. Logitech C270 -&gt; impossible to stream two C270 simultaneously on the same USB. Some webcams behave nice in regards to bandwidth, others behave nasty.</p>									</div>

					<p>I tried it yesterday and when I used webcamxp to get the second stream from a uspip camera it disonnected in the command interface. When i switch there is not a problem.

					<p>Some more detailed info on bandwidth from my own notes:</p><p>==== USB bandwidth ====</p><p>When streaming multiple webcams simultaneously (e.g. with mjpg_streamer), you have to keep in mind, that the bandwidth of your USB is limited to 480mbit/s (or more strict: 80% of 480 = 384mbit/s). This can become a problem, if you exceed the bandwidth-limit<br />&nbsp; * by too high resolution of your streams -&gt; lower the resolution of at least one cam<br />&nbsp; * by nasty cams that even at comparably low resolutions like 800x600 request the max bandwith (e.g. C270) -&gt; take at least one different (=not &quot;nasty&quot;) cam</p><p>When this happens, you will most likely get an error message from mjpg_streamer like &quot;no space left on device&quot;.</p><p>To get the bandwidth the camera requires, search &#039;&#039;lsusb -v&#039;&#039; for </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>   wWidth                  640
   wHeight                 480
   dwMinBitRate       24576000
   dwMaxBitRate      147456000

   wWidth                  800

   dwMaxBitRate      230400000

Note: Same values for C270 and Pro 9000!</code></pre></div><p>Alternatively, look at &#039;&#039;/sys/kernel/debug/usb/devices&#039;&#039; and search for something like &#039;&#039;B:&nbsp; Alloc=485/800 us (61%)&#039;&#039; while the camera is connected and transmitting video.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><p>&nbsp; * Pro 9000 = not nasty = requests less than max. bandwidth of 230,4mbit/s @ 800x600<br />&nbsp; * C270 = nasty = <span class="bbu">always</span> requests max. bandwidth of 230,4mbit/s @ 800x600</p><p>&nbsp; * 2x Pro 9000 + 1x C270 @ 800x600 -&gt; works<br />&nbsp; * 0x Pro 9000 + 2x C270 @ 800x600 -&gt; doesn&#039;t work; Error: **no space left on device**, since 2x 230,4mbit/s &gt; 384mbit/s<br />&nbsp; * 0x Pro 9000 + 2x C270 @ 640x480 -&gt; works</p>									</div>
