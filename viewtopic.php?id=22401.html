					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I am new to OpenWRT although been doing networking professionally for many years, which makes me almost ashamed to ask this but here goes... :-)</p><p>I spent the last week or so searching the forums and could not find a hint on what I am doing wrong. I have a feeling that I am missing something incredibly simple. I am just trying to connect the dir-615 C1 running openwrt to my main wireless router.</p><p>Installed various versions of Kamikaze (currently running on 16722 I think) and the same behavior.<br />Basically I cannot figure out how to make the DIR-615 router connect to my AP in client mode.</p><p>I don&#039;t need it to act as a wireless repeater (although that would be a bonus). The primary use for this is as a cheap wireless interface for an XBOX360 game console.</p><p>It&#039;s been a while since I messed with unix scripts so I am using Luci to put it into client mode and I am able to scan the area and see my AP, but for the life of me I cannot figure out how to actually make the thing Connect. Am I missing something?</p><p>I have a cheap linux based wireless router that I got years ago (Blanc) which works very well right now connected to the XBOX, it&#039;s acting as both client and AP (repeater), but it&#039;s a G class, and I would like to move to N with this DIR-615 (client only is fine).</p><p>I would appreciate a hint in the right direction.</p>									</div>
