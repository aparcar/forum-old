					<p>Thanks for that, appears the reboot on mamba happens on OpenWrt as well as LEDE. I just have not experienced it with any of my owrt builds, but that would be the nature of this issue.</p><p>@doITright, thanks, I still have that particular build on my drop. Good to know that the issue also happens with later kernels. I was beginning to wonder if maybe the reason I had not seen it on a owrt build was because I was always doing a linux-next image.</p><p>But(just a wee one), how to isolate this? No crash log file generated, assumption is that it is the kernel (probably correct), and I have not found any repeatable/identifiable method of forcing.</p>									</div>
