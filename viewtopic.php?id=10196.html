					<p>Hi, i&#039;m not being lazy, but have trawled and googled but not found a definitive answer.</p><p>Hopefully adding this to the list so it can be googled and may help others even if the end result is pointing me to a faq or other doc.</p><p>So, i&#039;m not asking about forwarding from the external interface vlan1 to internal machines. That&#039;s easy enough.</p><p>Briefly, i want a certain host in my local network to have all it&#039;s traffic forwarded back and forth to a openvpn tun0 interface. Thus i need two MASQUERADING (or SNAT ??) rules i think.</p><p>So, on my openwrt, i essentially have two WAN interfaces</p><p> 1. vlan1 to the WAN (lets say this ip is WAN_IP0 and gateway GW_IP0)<br /> 2. br0 internal LAN (lets say the ip addresses in the LAN is 10.0.0.x)<br /> 3. tun0 to a remote WAN p-t-p host&nbsp; (lets say this is WAN_IP1 and ptp IP is GW_IP1)</p><p>Now i need all traffic from an internal lan host, say 10.0.0.5 to be routed thru tun0. I should just be able to use iproute2 to do the forwarding, but can&#039;t for the life of me get it to work.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to integrate this into the /etc/init.d/S45firewall scripts so i don&#039;t have to make too many changes. </p><p>If i can do this then the next step would be to just tunnel HTTP(s) traffic to that interface by doing traffic classification (policy routing) using iptables and iproute, but first i need to know how to get all the traffic from a single host to be forwarded to the secondary WAN interface. I don&#039;t have the luxury to try too much combinations as i&#039;ve already locked myself once out of the router and had to reboot, so wife-approval-factor is diminishing.</p><p>Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dm66</strong> on 4 Apr 2007, 12:12)</p>

					<p>Stoopid me, had a typo in my rules. Here is the answer.</p><p>First choose a iproute2 table that is not being used already (use &#039;ip rule show&#039; to see the lookup tables).</p><p>I&#039;m choosing table 7 (for good luck) and i mark all packets from a host in my internal lan (say 1.0.0.5) with a mark of 7 also. Then assuming my previous explanation, here is the rules (also assume my internal br0 ip address is 1.0.0.1)</p><p> ip route add table 7 default via $GW_IP1<br /> ip route add table 7 1.0.0.0/24 dev br0 proto kernel scope link src 1.0.0.1<br /> ip rule add fwmark 7 table 7<br /> iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -s 1.0.0.5/32 -j MARK --set-mark 7<br /> iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o tun0 -j MASQUERADE&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /> iptables -A FORWARD -i br0 -o tun0 -j ACCEPT</p><p>Thats it</p>									</div>
