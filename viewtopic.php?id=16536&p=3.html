					<p>Finally mini_fo wants to behave. Applied some OpenWRT patches from the brcm-2.4 branch. Had to go back a few months. They removed the brcm-2.4 branch recently... But I&#039;m gonna give it a burn-in test for a bit to make sure it&#039;s not going to break and leave ya without access like a previous image I released -- ended up sending someone my spare serial cable to fix it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p><p>It&#039;s lean and mean. Simply boots up and jumps on an open wifi, dishes out 192.168.2.x IPs and does NAT. Anything else needs to be configured, via shell scripts. The storage is persistent tho, and the wiki will be updated with common configurations..</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve done a lots of good work on the wiki. I&#039;m unsure how well my work is on the firmware though. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> heh j/k.</p><p>For those interested, the firmware is here:<br /><a href="http://wiki.scottn.us/wrtu54g-tm:firmware">http://wiki.scottn.us/wrtu54g-tm:firmware</a></p><p>Client mode was unreliable for me as well using the opensource rt2x00 legacy drivers latest CVS release! So the wifi client mode uses Ralink&#039;s official source. It works very well, just uses old school iwpriv calls a lot. It&#039;s kinda it&#039;s own thing, rather than integrating into the available kernel wireless tools so much. It&#039;s nice tho. The firmware is OpenWRT-like, and could probably be completely OpenWRT with little efforts, I just don&#039;t understand their enormous build system!! Sorry..</p>									</div>

					<p>just flashed build 44. I&#039;m a little more lost than your previous builds. Nano is gone so i used vi instead. This time around the files you said to edit look drastically different. Not sure if the same procedure in the wiki firmware page is the same for this build.</p><p>Also, it says that the new build has a limited web panel. How can i access it? The default root/password is not working for the web panel.</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenWRT with Linux kernel 2.6.35.7 is built. This uses much more flexible and standard wifi modules. Hope this is a great help for anyone. Of course, one big plus of this router is it&#039;s inclusion of USB (via hardware modification) at such a low price! I regret that USB is not included.
