					<p>I&#039;m a network admin admin and am in the process of designing a wireless metwork. (sort of like a cell net), and not a newbie to linux or embedded linux</p><p>I&#039;d like to do the following.</p><p>1. have each node (ap) responsible for doling out a specific dhcp range (ok easy)</p><p>2. directly route all the node traffic to our centeral servers. (no nat just a direct route) the client IP needs to be at the servers (not the gateways)</p><p>3. The WAN is very big 255.248.0.0 (private space), any client IP in that range should be able to use any access point (regardless of where the IP came from) but it must be in that range...</p><p>4 sent the syslog to a remote server (simple)</p><p>The D-link ent AP (dwl1000ap) fits the bill, BUT it&#039;s not linux :0 and is $$$ </p><p>Any thoughts appreciated</p>									</div>

					<p>Use OpenWRT and a compatible ap and:</p><p>1. setup dnsmasq or udhcpd to give a different range of ip&#039;s on every access point.</p><p>2. setup the default route on every node as your central server. Edit the iptables rules and remove any lines which end -j MASQUERADE. Remove the wireless bridge (ifconfig br0 down followed by brctl delif br0). </p><p>3. Use&nbsp; 255.248.0.0 as your netmask on the wireless interfaces but have each machine only give out dhcp addresses from a small range. This way any AP will accept traffic from any ip in that range but will only allocate IPs in its specified range. </p><p>4. Use scp to send syslog every hour?</p><br /><p>Or, if your AP can do bridging (linksys AP&#039;s do this if you disable dhcp, dunno about dlink):</p><p>link every AP up to an ethernet switch/hub and connect them to a central router. This runs the dhcp server, does routing etc. All packets just pass through at the ethernet level from the wireless network to your ethernet. If your going long distance you&#039;ll have to encapsulate the ethernet in something else. You can get ethernet to ISDN bridges, LAN extension services from your telco, bridge back to wireless again or if your AP runs linux put the ethernet inside PPP and use the internet to carry it.</p>									</div>

					<p>The bridge is created due to lan_ifname being set to br0 .. any time any of the *_ifname variables is a br* the script will create a bridge and parse the corresponding *_ifname<strong>s</strong> variable.</p><p>So, you could do the following:</p><p>lan_ifname=vlan0<br />wan_ifname=vlan1<br />wifi_ifname=eth1</p><p>(assumes a v2 or above)</p>									</div>

					<p>Each access point has dhcp set to allow a subnet of the &#039;big net&#039;&nbsp; as it&#039;s pool.<br />The clients attach to any of the node access points (each having a different dhcp range).<br />They can then use (once they have any ip in the &#039;big net&#039;) any of the access points. This way they don&#039;t need to get a new dhcp ip (because they already hae one in the &#039;big net&#039;, and the lease is valid)</p><p>So in short the access points all give different sub-ranges in the &#039;big net&#039;</p>									</div>

					<p>I use the following code on an old laptop to do straight through routing from its wireless (eth1 - 192.168.2.x) to wired (eth0 - 192.168.3.x) interfaces. One problem i&#039;ve noticed with this is that every machine on the wired network must be told where to route packets to reach the wireless network, if I use nat this isn&#039;t the case. As i&#039;ve only got a small network I do this by adding rules manually to the each system, but in a large setup you&#039;d need to get DHCP to supply this or use something like RIP. </p><p>For this to work you&#039;ll also need your default route set correctly. </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

#turn on ip forwarding to let packets pass through
echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

#reset iptables
iptables -F
iptables -t nat -F

#set default policies
iptables -P INPUT DROP
iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
iptables -P FORWARD DROP

iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -j ACCEPT

iptables -A INPUT -i eth1 -s 192.168.2.2 -m mac --mac-source 01:23:45:67:89:AB -j ACCEPT
iptables -A FORWARD -i eth1 -s 192.168.2.2 -m mac --mac-source 01:23:45:67:89:AB -j ACCEPT</code></pre></div><p>This only lets through a single ip, which must have the correct MAC. If you want to let everything through then take out the -m mac and --mac-source bits, and change the -s bit to 0/0 or the CIDR notation for your network (e.g. 192.168.2.0/24). For example:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -A INPUT -i eth1 -s 192.168.2.0/24 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A FORWARD -i eth1 -s 192.168.2.0/24 -j ACCEPT</code></pre></div>									</div>
