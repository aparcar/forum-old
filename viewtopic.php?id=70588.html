					<p>I downloaded Davidc502&#039;s <strong>Moderately Customized Development [DD] Build</strong>&nbsp; LEDE system image for my Linksys WRT1900ACS V2 router and verified the checksum of the downloaded file using both MD5 &amp; SHA checksum verification utility and the Quick Hash GUI application. I downloaded the file multiple times and ran both application numerous times. The file&#039;s hash is supposed to be </p><p>873110f295ac8f7c2e5ac2a3bfcb2f33edf4d405e0489ee483bd23837d46124e <strong>*lede-mvebu-linksys-wrt1900acs-squashfs-factory.img</strong></p><p>But the SHA256 hash reported is</p><p>3E9B7D4C1118278DD1D96EE02330594B4CA7E9445E0DD7D40599D67B3A99701A</p><p>Both Checksum verification programs return the same exact hash, and none match the expected hash </p><p>The stable version Chaos Calmer has the correct SHA-256 hash, however I would like to flash my router with Davidc502&#039;s build but because the hash does not match I am worried it might be a corrupted download. I have downloaded the file with both Firefox and Chrome with the same results. I really don&#039;t want to proceed any further.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>aweir14150</strong> on 13 Apr 2017, 21:39)</p>
