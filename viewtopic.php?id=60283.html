					<p>Hello All,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;So I flashed OpenWRT, but now have to connect it via a EE Broadband router (Yes I now know I could of probably flashed the EE Router instead).&nbsp; Anyway as the EE Router is pretty simplist settings and so can&#039;t be configured as a bridge I&#039;ve disabled the DHPC on the EE Router, enabled DHPC on the OpenWRT Router and set the DNS names on the OpenWRT Router to my ISP ones, BUT on connecting to the OpenWRT Router (Wifi or RJ45) I can ping names (i.e. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk">www.bbc.co.uk</a>) resolves a 212.58.246.104 BUT no traffic gets through (Request Time Out).&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m &quot;guessing&quot; this is something to do with routing rules?, but am stuck to see which.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Also The WAN port on the OpenWRT router can&#039;t be used (no DHCP would work when EE Router was connected to OpenWRT wan port (which I guess is fair enough)), but this now means my EE Router is connected to LAN1 and my &quot;actual&quot; LAN is connected to LAN2, and this means I can&#039;t identify which is which in LUA (as all are grouped under br-lan).&nbsp; How can I name LAN0 (eth.0??) as &quot;wan&quot; so I can apply different firefall rules?</p><p>&nbsp; Regards</p>									</div>
