					<p>Hello,<br />I would like to replace my current network (powered by two wrt54g) with a more powerful router.&nbsp; OpenWRT Kamikaze support would be preferred, but Debian would be okay too...</p><p>here&#039;s what I&#039;d like:<br />- support for at least two MiniPCI interfaces (802.11a and 802.11g, with 802.11n in the future)<br />- 64 MB of RAM or greater (32 MB could be tolerable)<br />- fast enough to handle routing 10MBit of internet traffic with QoS of P2P and VoIP and some firewalling, along with light OpenVPN traffic<br />- (internet connection is PPPoE; could be done on-modem but the modem&#039;s implementation is slow)<br />- and WPA2/WEP across multiple SSIDs on Atheros cards <br />- internet traffic will flow mainly over Internet, but high-performance for wifi is preferred for file transfers/media playing<br />- with rflow and snmp<br />- with adequately sized onboard flash or support for CF, SD, IDE, or USB 2.0<br />- with two ethernet interfaces (lan and wan)</p><p>I have determined that the following devices could possibly work:<br /><a href="http://www.soekris.com/net5501.htm">Soekris net5501</a><br /><a href="http://www.soekris.com/net4826.htm">Soekris net4826</a><br /><a href="http://www.routerboard.com/rb500.html">RouterBoard 532A</a><br /><a href="http://www.pcengines.ch/wrap1e103.htm">PC Engines WRAP 1e</a><br /><a href="http://www.gateworks.com/avila_processors.htm">Gateworks Avila</a></p><p>Does anyone have any experience with any of them or know of any other resources for this kind of stuff or other devices to consider?<br />I&#039;ve heard that the Geodes have poor IO and/or CPU performance.&nbsp; So far, one of the Gateworks boards look like the best choice with the RouterBoard in second.</p><p>The other option would be to go with PC hardware; however, I prefer something small, low-power, and passively cooled.<br />edit: I suppose an older laptop with two PCMCIA slots and/or miniPCI slots could suffice as well, if it had a ULV Pentium M or other similarly low-powered fanless CPU..</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fdl4</strong> on 8 Feb 2007, 02:30)</p>

					<p>You could use an old P3 and underclock and undervolt it. I am currently making a router with a 733MHz P3 underclocked to 550MHz and running on 1.3v. It has 384MB of RAM and will run off a custom DC/DC converter powered by an old 65w laptop power supply. (Expecting actual load under 45w.) I have plans to make a custom case from laser-cut steel and it has a front panel LCD. I also used a 2.5&quot; hard drive (3GB) to reduce heat. It should need a very small fan for cooling at the most.<br />Very cheap and recycles some old hardware. You should be able to find someone who would give you one for free or sell it for a very low cost.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t think it will actually use 45w. The TDP of a stock 733MHz P3 is about 20W - comparable to modern mobile CPUs. Underclock and undervolt and it goes down. I will measure actual current draw when I&#039;m finished building the router. (I highly doubt it&#039;s going to actually use anywhere near 45w based on heat output. The 45w is a worst-case calculation.)<br />Besides, with as little power as we&#039;re concerned here, hardware costs will wipe out any savings.</p>									</div>

					<p>I wonder how the performance of the RouterBoard 532A compares to the Gateworks and SC1100 boards.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t realize it had a CF slot in addition to two mini PCI slots.&nbsp; It uses a MIPS CPU up to 400MHz.&nbsp; It&#039;s cheaper and easier to find accessories for than the Gateworks board, and is easily upgraded for two or six more mini PCI slots.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fdl4</strong> on 11 Feb 2007, 20:27)</p>

A system using a 733MHz P3 underclocked to 550MHz/1.3v (along with 512MB of RAM and 2 NICs, both active) drew a mere 0.5A at idle on 5v, rising to 1.6A at full load. Draw on 3.3v was 2A at idle, rising to 3A at full load. Draw on 12v was 0.3A largely independent of load. (Note that the 12v drawn by the motherboard itself is only 0.1A, with the OLED backlight of the front panel LCD and the CPU fan accounting for the remaining 0.2A. Also note that it does not include the main disk, although laptop hard drives draw about 0.5A to 1A on 5v and Flash cards draw 0.1A or less on 5v or 3.3v...)<br />Since I ordered 6A voltage regulators for the 5v and 3.3v, looks like the calculations suggest something way overkill, especially for the 5v... I&#039;ll get a nice safety margin, though...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>star882</strong> on 21 Feb 2007, 02:39)</p>
