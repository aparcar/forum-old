					<p>I&#039;ve read the current docs on how to install Kamikaze on the Meraki.&nbsp; These docs represent the result of a lot of great work by candlerb and others.&nbsp; But me being fairly time-poor, and wanting to deploy Merakis in a largish community network (Melbourne Wireless), I would like to be able to install OpenWRT using a method as easy as with the WRT54G - i.e. by uploading a single binary file that &quot;just works&quot; as is.</p><p>It&#039;d be nice to just SSH in to the Meraki vendor firmware, upload a single file, and issue &quot;mtd -r write openwrt.bin linux&quot;</p><p>As far as I can see, things that prevent this are:<br />* Meraki&#039;s Redboot can&#039;t load LZMA kernels<br />* There seems to be no Linux tool to label/remap flash partitions - this has to be done in Redboot<br />* Meraki&#039;s stage2 loader doesn&#039;t read the flash to get the partition boundaires - they are hard-coded in<br />* Meraki&#039;s stage2 loader wants a silly CRC checksum added to the Kernel</p><p>From <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=7189&amp;p=2">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=7189&amp;p=2</a><br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>nbd wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I do intend to add LZMA loader support.

					<p>The both essentially the same. I do hope one day, the developers can write a new 2nd stage loader but for anyone that is eager to hack the meraki in the meanwhile, my offer still stands.

					<p>I think your making things too complicated for yourself.<br />however, that would indeed work. slightly different commands would be needed from ssh to flash the images (you wouldn&#039;t flash stage2 on fon, probably different mtd numbers, etc)<br />plus, if you don&#039;t go into redboot, you are stuck with the default flash layout, which is not ideal on the fon (but OK for most uses), and DEFINITELY not ideal on the meraki.<br />make it easier for yourself and hook up a serial console to each unit, run a few scripted commands, and be done <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>if you make a configuration in advance you wanted to use on multiple machines, you COULD update it from linux, by using mtd to write the redboot config area. this is actually pretty easy to do since the default firmware is set up to allow it (copy the config area from a device with the desired setup)</p><p>do not change the &quot;board config&quot; partition. all that has is mac address, serial number, radio configuration, etc</p>									</div>

					<p>thanks Kevin, that&#039;s useful info.</p><p>If we are using a stage2 loader, do we really need to update the flash map in Redboot?&nbsp; So long as our new stage2 loader fits in the same partition as the vendor (Meraki) stage2, could our new stage2 work out for itself where the new partition boundaries are?&nbsp; Is there a problem if we overwrite the part1, part2 and /storage partitions and don&#039;t tell Redboot about it?</p><p>I&#039;m thinking that when we change the flash map we aren&#039;t actually doing anything to the flash partition boundaries themselves, we are just creating a list of start and end addresses in the &quot;redboot conf&quot; partition for use by Redboot.&nbsp; If the actual boundaries are different to what Redboot thinks they are, is this a big issue? - Redboot only needs to know where stage2 is.</p><p>I don&#039;t know this, I&#039;m just guessing - tell me if I&#039;m wrong. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>you could have data wherever you want on the chip, but linux uses the redboot informtion to determine the partition layout, unless you include a static mapping or use some other method. redboot itself will not complain about the data unless you overwrite redboot (well it wouldn&#039;t complain then either, would it..) or the redboot/fis config or board config</p><p>you could use the original stage2 loader only if the kernel image is in the proper position (part1, part2 for backup image if wanted, but part2 is better used as storage in this case), and has the proper header added.</p>									</div>

					<p>After mucking around for the past day with my new Meraki mini, I&#039;ve learned some pretty good tricks for easing the flashing and reflashing of OpenWRT.</p><p>The Wiki greatly over complicates things.&nbsp; It is quite easy to automate the flashing via the ethernet port without using a serial cable.&nbsp; The biggest trick is interupting Redboot when you telnet into it.&nbsp; As I found out the hard way telnet on my SuSE machine never sends the Ctrl-C.&nbsp; There are several great solutions to automating this on the NSLU2-linux site: <a href="http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/HowTo/TelnetIntoRedBoot">http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/HowTo/TelnetIntoRedBoot</a>&nbsp; I&#039;ve been using the netcat method and it never misses.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just remember that for the Meraki you need your machine set to 192.168.84.9 and the Meraki is at 192.168.84.1.</p><p>Forget keeping the Meraki partitioning.&nbsp; It&#039;s a mess.&nbsp; I wanted to use a squashfs partition with a jffs overlay like on broadcom routers, so here&#039;s what I did:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>fis init
load -r -b 0x80041000 -m tftp -h 192.168.84.9 openwrt-atheros-2.6-vmlinux.gz
fis create -r 0x80041000 -l 0x200000 -e 0x80041000 linux
load -r -b 0x80041000 -m tftp -h 192.168.84.9 openwrt-atheros-2.6-root.squashfs
fis create -r 0x80041000 -l 0x650000 -e 0x80041000 rootfs</code></pre></div><p>Then I ran fconfig and changed the boot script to:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>fis load -d linux
exec</code></pre></div><p>Be patient.&nbsp; The flash on these things are very slow to write and you will see many AHB errors.&nbsp; Redboot quits talking to telnet whenever a fis command is running.&nbsp; Any network activity at these times creates these errors.&nbsp; Just ignore them.&nbsp; When the write operation is complete you will see telnet come back to life.&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#039;t be fooled that something is wrong when you enter the fis create commands.&nbsp; You will see nothing back from Redboot until the command completes.&nbsp; </p><p>Some explantion of this flashing method:<br />The first partion created for the kernel is approximately 1.5mb.&nbsp; You only need about 1mb, but I left extra room so I can upgrade for the forseeable life of these without ever getting into redboot again.&nbsp; Ideally I want to automate upgrades while these things are running in the field so reconnecting to the ethernet port is out of the question.</p><p>The second partition is allocated the rest of the free space and the squashfs image fills just the beginning.&nbsp; Once OpenWRT boots for the first time it will create a jffs partition in any remaining space not taken by the squashfs partition and mount it in the typical overlay fashion.&nbsp; </p><p>Now for upgrading OpenWRT all you have to do is scp the kernel and new squashfs image to the /tmp directory and run the following command:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mtd -e linux write openwrt-atheros-2.6-vmlinux.gz linux;mtd -e rootfs -r write openwrt-atheros-2.6-root.squashfs rootfs</code></pre></div><p>Again be very patient as the flash is much slower than on any other hardware that I&#039;ve run OpenWRT.</p>									</div>
