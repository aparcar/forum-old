					<p>I&#039;m messing with the LED configuration on my Archer C5, and I have a couple of questions. First, the two LEDs to the left and the LAN/WAN LEDs seem to be already configured and working properly, but there are no entries for them in LuCI. Where can I change their functionality if I need to? Second, to the left is what I suspect is the power LED, but what is the one next to it configured as? On my router it just seems to be constantly on.</p>									</div>

					<p>Isn&#039;t the second one from the left the one that is blinking for a few seconds during bootup to indicate that OpenWrt can be put in failsafe mode by pressing the reset/wps button before it stops blinking, then blinks really fast if you actually do this?<br />If so, you may find a reference to it in the C5/C7-specific implementation of the preinit shell function set_state or in a similar specific version of diag.sh .</p><p>As for the LAN and WAN LEDs, on the C5/C7, all 5 Ethernet sockets are connected to the switch IC, so I guess those LEDs are mostly controlled by the switch IC, though there may be I/O options (via GPIO or switch control ports) to adjust their use.</p>									</div>

					<p>More specifically, the second LED from the left is &quot;tp-link:blue:system&quot; (it&#039;s in target/linux/ar71xx/base-files/etc/diag.sh).</p>									</div>
