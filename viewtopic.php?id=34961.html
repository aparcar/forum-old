					<p>I have a Netgear WNDR3700 with Backfire Firmware Attitude Adjustment (r30676) running.<br />I tested Openvpn and L2TP/IPsec with my Android Phone to this router.<br />The Up/Download Speed is always 700kbit. (Router has 16Mbit DSL connectivity and Phone tested through Wifi/HSDPA)<br />I checked CPU on Phone and Router and its maximum 5%<br />What could shape the speed so drastic?</p>									</div>

					<p>a 680MHz Atheros CPU should be enough for at least 15Mbit/s, so I don&#039;t think that the cpu-speed is the problem.</p><p>My first tip is the phone or the networkconnection of the phone. maybe qos on the router.</p><p>You should get a better test-client. e.g a PC connected directly to the wan-port of the router.</p>									</div>
