					<p>NSLU2 with Kamikaze 7.09</p><p>I&#039;ve installed my main system on the slug itself but any subsequent pacakges are installed on an external USB stick.<br />I now have a problem with starting apps during boot time which are installed on this USB stick.<br />When I add a script in /etc/init.d to enable and start the script during boot time I have the problem that my USB stick is not mounted yet even if I create the init script as last one to run (i.e. S99....).<br />How can I control these boot order dependencies?<br />Should I look at adding something to /etc/hotplug.d/usb/10-usb-storage and run the app from there?<br />How can I make sure the USB drive is ready when I want to start my app?<br />I don&#039;t want to log in everytime and start all these apps by hand.</p>									</div>
