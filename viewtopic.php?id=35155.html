					<p>All,</p><p>I have been running another firmware for years, and really for the past couple of years the firmware quality has become unacceptable. I&#039;ve heard about OpenWRT for a long time, but was always &quot;afraid&quot; of the CLI with no GUI. It&#039;s not that I can&#039;t do CLI, it&#039;s just that I am uncomfortable in LINUX and like to visually confirm settings.</p><p>Anyway, I need to ask a few questions I didn&#039;t see in the WIKI (I&#039;ve read these pages (http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/user.beginner <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/basic.config">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/basic.config</a> <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials)">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials)</a> and some others.</p><p>My main questions are these:</p><p>1) I have downloaded both &quot;factory-NA&quot; images (EDIT: Stable and Trunk) for my WNDR3700v2 router. Can I TFTP these images over the old firmware in recovery mode? Or do I have to do this from the update area of the vendor firmware?<br />2) Is LuCI included in the download? I see how to use OPKG to install it, but is it actually in the image? If not, where do I need to go to read on how to do this?<br />3) Is LuCI tied into every setting of OpenWRT? The previous firmware I was using, the GUI would &quot;override&quot; the commands in a weird way, so the man pages would tell you one thing, and the GUI would turn those commands into something else and would override. My main use for the firmware is compatible DHCP static leases utilizing dnsmasq I can copy and paste into multiple routers.</p><p>If any of these are answered in a more advanced Wiki page, I&#039;d be happy to read first. I just didn&#039;t find them in the pages I was looking in.</p><p>Thank you.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>thetoad30</strong> on 2 Mar 2012, 18:32)</p>

I can do as you suggest, but I don&#039;t really learn anything and I&#039;ll be right back to my questions.</p><p>I really feel that if I can get a web interface up, and that web interface links in with all the settings, I&#039;ll be able to configure the router easily.</p><p>Thank you</p>									</div>

					<p>1)This you have to look in the router model wiki it will tell you how to get openwrt on it<br />2)LuCI is not always included, the only way to tell is to either find the config file which auto generate the image or flash and try<br />3)It is suppose to be able to config the config file correctly but after a while you will rather vi the files</p>									</div>

I have seen this page (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3700">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3700</a>) and have updated my switch LEDs as shown but I wanted to also update the wireless radio LEDs. Do I need to add a device or how do I edit the network file to point to the device?</p><p>Thank you for the help! I really like OpenWRT so far.</p>									</div>

					<p>Dear the Toad:</p><p>Anyway, I need to ask a few questions I didn&#039;t see in the WIKI (I&#039;ve read these pages (http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/user.beginner <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/basic.config">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/basic.config</a> <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials)">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials)</a> and some others.</p><p>I have read these but I am going to read them again. Maybe I will find a reason to add/config luci. I don&#039;t need to configure this router remotely and I don&#039;t think that I need a gui either. Unless there is something luci can do that can&#039;t be done by the interpreter. </p><p>You guys carry on like school children. Sometime people are smarter, some more knowledgeable.&nbsp; I t won&#039;t take long and I will surpass your knowledge too.</p>									</div>
