					<p>Hello. I&#039;m new in OpenWRT.<br />I bought TL MR3020. Then I tried to install OpenWRT. I used this firmware (goo.gl/Y97Iv ). I tried installing it through WebGUI. Progress bar was updated to 77% or something like this, than I get out to take some cofee and when I came back, there was connection error on screen (sorry, I can&#039;t remember correct error). After router reboot, it died. Ping (192.168.1.1) fails, telnet cannot connect... And browser too. When I turn it on, there once lighting all 5 LEDs and then only Power LED is ON. And there is no reaction on button pressing (or how should I say here?).</p><p>I have no connection to my router, that&#039;s awful. I don&#039;t know what to do now. Can anyone help me? If you need more info, I&#039;ll try to tell all, but I don&#039;t know what should I say more..</p><p>P.S. Sorry for my bad English.. =\</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kenik2006</strong> on 26 Nov 2012, 15:48)</p>

					<p>Did you try to connect using Ethernet (not wireless)?</p><p>Also, when unpluging/repluging the router, you say all LEDs turned on, then only Power LED. No WPS LED flashing?

This is an invaluable source of information, and you should try to find information in it yourself, BEFORE posting into the forum, or there will be a lot of useless duplicate posts there, for a large&nbsp; loss of time and energy.</p><p>So, please, take the time to read it carefully: it is really worth it, you will learn a lot about OpenWrt in there!</p><p>Back to the cable, you can take any UART TTL &lt;=&gt; USB cable, but you will have to figure out the wiring by yourself.</p><p>All you need are the RX/TX/GND signals, so only 3 wires. The best way to find out for an unknown cable is to take a multimeter: the GND is the lowest voltage and is stable. The TX from the cable that should be wired to the router&#039;s RX will have varying voltage when you type in characters in the PC terminal emulator. The router&#039;s TX (cable RX) is the latest one if you have only 3 wires, or you may have to experiment...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Squonk</strong> on 26 Nov 2012, 18:30)</p>
