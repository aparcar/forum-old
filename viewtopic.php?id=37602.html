					<p>Hi hopefully this is a simple fix, have installed OpenWrt Backfire 10.03.1 on my WNDR3700v1. Everything is working fine, except for all four of the ethernet ports. They correctly display the port speed, so link level is OK, just not anything above that. The LEDs for each connected port all blink at the same rate, once a second roughly.</p><p>Here is my /etc/config/network&nbsp; - any suggestions welcomed:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# cat /etc/config/network

					<p>I&#039;m going to try the default network config again - there&#039;s traffic to both WIFI radios, everything is fine except no ethernet port is functioning. AFAIR all I changed was setting static IP for the WAN port, but I&#039;ll try again.</p>									</div>

In my Backfire it has always been just the simple eth0. <br />I have also never seen _orig_bridge or _orig_ifname options. <br />So, I wonder if your config is coming from some customized build or something like that... It definitely is not the official default Backfire config for WNDR3700. Which build is your Backfire? Have you downloaded it from the Openwrt repository <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/ar71xx/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/ar71xx/</a> ?</p>									</div>
