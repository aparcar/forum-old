					<p>Hello</p><p>I bought a Zappiti Media Player with Android and OpenWrt inside.<br />I discovered there is a BitTorrent inside too<br />I installed a 1TB Harddrive and would like to write torrent files on it.<br />When I use Transmission on my Win 7 PC or Vuze (Android app) on my Zappitti player, I can download torrent but it write on the internal memory which have only 8GB left so the memory is almost instantly full.</p><p>My question is : How can I write to the HDD, which path do I have to set in the transmission web page options ?</p><p>I tried &quot;/storage/1E5451CB5451A5F5/Android/data/com.vuze.torrent.downloader/files/Vuze/Torrent&quot; or &quot;/storage/1E5451CB5451A5F5/Torrent&quot;</p><p>1E5451CB5451A5F5 is my HDD ID</p><p>Downloading start but it write nothing on the disk and after a few seconds, I get a &quot;Unable to save resume file: No space left on device&quot; on Transmission remote (Of course I have 1TB free on the HDD)</p><p>Original OpenWrt path is &quot;/tmp/transmission/done&quot; (which work but on the internal very limited memory)</p><p>Thank you for your help</p>									</div>
