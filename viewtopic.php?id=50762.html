					<p>Hi, everyone, I am not sure if I bricked my router (TP-Link TL-MR3220) but now the problem is, I can&#039;t login to (both telnet and access the web interface) the router with the default IP address (191.168.1.1). Every time I connect my laptop to the router, I get the IP address as shown in the picture below</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/71150695/problem1.JPG" alt="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/71150695/problem1.JPG" /></span></p><p>Meanwhile, I roughly remember that the last setting I made to the router (before the problem occurred) was as following(screenshot was taken using another router)</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/71150695/problem2.JPG" alt="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/71150695/problem2.JPG" /></span><br /><span class="postimg"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/71150695/problem3.JPG" alt="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/71150695/problem3.JPG" /></span></p><p>I am not sure if the setting I made above was the root cause for the problem. In case it is, what should I do to bring my router back to function?</p><p>Thanks for every comment in advance!.</p>									</div>

					<p>Have you tried the failsafe mode?<br />When the router starts - pick the reset button untl the led blinks rapidly.<br />Then give yourself a static IP address of 192.168.1.2 and telnet to your device (now 192.168.1.1)<br />to repair your configuration. If your OpenWrt installation uses the squashfs file system - then use<br />the &quot;mount_root&quot; command to be able to make permament changes.</p><p>Edit: clarifications</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mwarning</strong> on 24 May 2014, 16:21)</p>
