					<p>Hi,</p><p>Many routers using proprietary OS&#039;s have the ability to take a single public IP address and use it on the router to provide NAT services to client PCs WHILST AT THE SAME TIME allowing that same single public IP address to be used by one of the client PCs so that it does not have it&#039;s connections NATed. Thomson Speedtouch, Westell, and other routers can all do this.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure how they actually do this, my guess is that they have a NAT connection tracking table and they track the sessions which the public IP holding client PC initiates and then &quot;stay away&quot; from using those ports, possibly also using very high &gt;60000 dynamic ports which I think are actually intended for NAT usage. What they do if the client PC chooses to use a port which the router is already using for NATed traffic I don&#039;t know, possibly they forcibly PAT it.</p><p>I&#039;ve been relying on this functionality for years, but now I&#039;ve got a VDSL connection and would like to use OpenWRT but I really need this functionality back.</p><p>Does anyone know how it is possible to do this with OpenWRT or even have a clue about how you&#039;d start doing it with Linux/IPtables in general?</p><p>Thanks,</p>									</div>
