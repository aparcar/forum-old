					<p>Hello,</p><p>You could check my question in this forum too: <a href="http://serverfault.com/q/646856/255461">http://serverfault.com/q/646856/255461</a></p><p>I have an Ubiquiti AirRouter wich I&#039;ve configured using CoovaAP. After CoovaAP installation the router has OpenWRT on it, and you can access to the router configuration using a Java application, or connect via SSH to configure the router manually.</p><p>I&#039;ve configured a Hotspot that&#039;s working in the IP Range 10.1.0.0/24</p><p>This Hotspot works only for Wifi, It doesn&#039;t works for Ethernet. If you connect via Wifi you&#039;re redirected to the captive portal, but if you connect via Ethernet, you have full access to internet, and I want to change this.</p><p>I want to redirect all the Ethernet ports to the Hotspot (I supose this is the easiest solution), or create a VLAN for ethernet ports 1&amp;2 and redirect them to Hotspot. </p><p>I don&#039;t care if I need to redirect all the Ethernet ports, I need to redirect to Hotspot via Ethernet and I don&#039;t have any idea.</p><p>It&#039;s enough if somebody knows a good tutorial/guide/man page where I could understand how to redirect Ethernet to Hotspot</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>liarezz</strong> on 26 Nov 2014, 10:32)</p>
