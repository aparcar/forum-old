					<p>hey everyone,</p><p>I just wanted to let you know that it is possible to replace the wifi-nic in the Asus WL500gp.<br />I bought that AP some time ago, because of its powerful cpu, enough ram&amp;flash and the usb ports,<br />but I was disappointed about the wireless range/performance.<br />I then decided to try the following and it works fine for me. <br />Sorry if you all already know this, I wasn&#039;t able to find something about that in the wiki or forum and so may be you find this useful:</p><p>1. Hardware<br />You can open the Asus WL500gp case easily by removing the bolts at the bottom of the unit. (they&#039;re covered by the gum-feet, remove them).<br />I think I don&#039;t have to mention that you may lose your warranty because of that...<br />Have a look at the inner-life of your Asus, I guess you will immediately notice that it uses a regular minipci wireless-nic (broadcom).<br />Remove it and replace it with (whatever) wireless-nic you like.<br />The built-in broadcom minipci with the asus label is glued to the board, so be careful when removing it.<br />(I&#039;m now using an Ubiquiti XR2 (600mw)(atheros) as replacement and it works fine..)</p><p>2. Software/Firmware<br />Your firmware/OS/openwrt will need drivers for your new wireless-nic, so make sure you chose a card, that is supported.<br />Anyway, I suggest you first flash to OpenWRT and make sure it works before you replace the wireless-nic.<br />I&#039;m using Kamikaze broadcom 2.6 release of OpenWRT together with the madwifi drivers (available as easy-to-install package),<br />don&#039;t forget hostapd if you want to run an ap, but that not part of this thread...</p><p>So after this little &quot;tweaking&quot; my Asus WL500gp became exactly what I was looking for.. :-)</p>									</div>
