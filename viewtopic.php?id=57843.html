					<p>I have some software I wish to run on the tplink 703n 15gb extroot, 1gb swap, but it is fighting me every step of the way.</p><p>I am currently using chaos calmer r45886 and I tried to install python-pip which was successful, but every command I issued from &quot;search&quot; to &quot;install&quot; resulted in a &quot;SSLError: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] unknown error&quot; I&#039;ve tried rectifying this the best I could such as applying a CACERT from a good company but nothing I did could fix it.</p><p>I gave up and downloaded and installed pip 1.2.1 which I believe was the last known version that didn&#039;t use SSL. But now with that installed every time I try to install a package it searches in the wrong base directory and tells me the package does not exist even though it clearly does (after all &quot;pip search Twisted&quot; showed results). It keeps wanting to search <a href="http://pypi.python.org/simple/">http://pypi.python.org/simple/</a> even if I specify the -i flag to change the url it doesn&#039;t help.</p><p>After that I tried to download the Twisted source itself and use easy_install to install it, but it was complaining about mips gcc not being found, go figure.</p><p>So now I&#039;m here with a project I wan&#039;t to get working on this router and no way to get the packages I need on it.</p><p>Is there a guide or a simple way to cross compile the python modules I need? I have the buildroot installed and working and I need at least 10 python modules which I can&#039;t find anywhere in the openwrt repos.</p><p>Here is a list of some packages I need. I may not need all of these, but most of them I do:</p><p>Twisted<br />requests<br />scapy<br />msgpack-python<br />dnspython<br />dnslib<br />configobj<br />Pillow<br />pefile<br />ipy<br />pyopenssl<br />service_identity<br />watchdog<br />impacket<br />capstone<br />pypcap</p><br /><p>Thanks for any help or suggestions for getting any of this working.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>abduct</strong> on 8 Jun 2015, 00:05)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m a Python noob but I thought that point of Python was that it doesn&#039;t need compiling. But regarding recompiling packages, why not start by looking at existing OpenWrt Python packages and how they are compiled, maybe that gives you a clue.</p>									</div>
