					<p>TrendNet 452BRP is a WiFi+4xLAN(ethernet-100) router. <br />There are 3 different devices, marked as different revisions. Mine is initial revision A.<br /><a href="http://www.trendnet.com/en/downloads/info/TEW-452BRP.htm">http://www.trendnet.com/en/downloads/in … 452BRP.htm</a> - images of different revisions.</p><p>This model is not listed in known hardware at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware?action=show&amp;redirect=toh">http://wiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware … direct=toh</a><br />So to run the OpenWRT i need the advice to identify hardware and proper build for it.</p><p><em>This model has quite buggy firmware and no chance for update of it. Its look-and-feel looked much better than one of wired-only D-Link (604P? 704? no mater) I used before i wanted Wi-Fi, however it turned out that despite of techy look it was cut on features and had clear bugs at the same time.</em></p><p><em>Especially buggy to my experience was Wi-Fi: somedays computers (notebooks with intel centrino, desktop with trendnet USB stick) were working quite nice. Other days the Wi-Fi connection freezed after several minutes of work and needed to reconnect via disabling and re-enabling radio ot Wi-Fi network cards. Maybe that may be due to Ostankino TV tower quite close to the window, but signal level meters were fine and distance was 3-7 meters w/o anythign between antennas, but 1cm-think wooden table legs. And qutie frequently routing was lost (until reset of the device) between wired and Wi-Fi PCs. Each group saw another, each group was finely ruoted into WAN, but none could access (even ping) each other.</em></p><p><em>Together with other bugs, this make me put some hope on the OpenWRT. And... What the beast is this router ?</em></p><p>Below is info that i hope wil help people, familiar with hardware, to identify it, suggest build and perhaps put the infro into known-hardware wiki table.</p><p>1) it seems that some Asus routers are made by the same OEM as TrendNet 452BRP Rev.A<br />&nbsp; <a href="http://wl500g.info/showthread.php?t=4858">http://wl500g.info/showthread.php?t=4858</a></p><p>2) Here is its PCB - i hope it to be quite usual and generic, so i hope someone will just recognise it.<br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/60489289@N00/2121185290/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/60489289@N00/2121185290/</a></p><p>3) below are markings on the chips:</p><p><em>a: perhaps RAM</em><br /><strong>MX</strong>S051411<br />29LV800BBTC-70<br />2L407000<br /><em>70 seems to be 70ns timings, LV - low-voltage... Guess i can find the datasheet, but maybe the arkking is already easy to read to someone here - so what are the features of the chip?</em></p><p><em>b: perhaps flash-RAM?</em><br /><strong><em>ESMT</em></strong><br />M12L64164A-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7T<br />SZP1C50GM&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0518</p><p><em>c: Wi-Fi processor</em><br /><strong>ATHEROS</strong><br />AR2313A-00<br />B30583B<br />0525<br /><em>this &quot;-00&quot; - does it mean initial and most buggy revision of chip?</em></p><p><em>d: CPU and wired LAN</em><br /><em>MARVELL LOGO</em><br />88E6060-RCJ<br />A36554.3<br />0451&nbsp; &nbsp;B0E</p>									</div>
