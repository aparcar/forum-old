					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am working on VR9 - lantiq soc and I am using Lantiq&#039;s UGW software.<br />I would like to use spi as a bus between the VRX and the FPGA.<br />I need to write a user-space application in UGW that acess some registers in the FPGA using spi.<br />As far I as I know, the only way to use spi in the user space is to use spidev</p><p>I have spidev.ko as a module in my software and to test if the driver works correctly I executed spidev_test.c!</p><p>1- spidevB.c is not created in /dev/<br />2- spidev exist as class under /sys/class and spi exist as a device with major number 158 in /proc/devices but no spidevB.C is created<br />3- I created another driver that is called &quot;ebbchar.ko&quot; (bzy following this tutorial: [derekmolloy.ie/writing-a-linux-kernel-module-part-2-a-character-device/ ) that creates a device uder /dev/ ButI couldn t find the device under /dev/ but it exist under /sys/class/ebb/ebbchar and if i create manulally by mknod the problem is resolved which is not the same case as spi,</p><p>the mapping of the GPIO pins with the different signals of spi is already defined in vr9_ref_board,c</p><p>Ps: the board does not support any GPIO_support or SPI_gpio.</p><p>I hope that someone is able to help me with this! I have been stuck since a long time in such a problem.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p><p>Best Regards,<br />Dhouha</p>									</div>
