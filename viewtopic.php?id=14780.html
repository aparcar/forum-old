					<p>Hi all, Hi all,<br />I&#039;ve been using linux and OpenWRT for a good few years, and any problems I&#039;ve had have always been solved by someone previously, often on this great forum. However, this one has me stumped, so I thought I&#039;d better ask the experts.</p><p>I&#039;ve got a small LAN at home, consisting of my media pc (Fedora 6), a Dreambox, an Asus WL500g running OpenWRT Kamikaze(7.09, acting as a file server, with the attached usb storage), an old laptop running Slackware (wireless), and a Linksys WRT54GS (also OpenWRT Kamikaze 7.07). This setup worked great (or so I thought) for about 6 months, until I tried to stream video between the devices (specifically between the PC and Dreambox). I originally had the asus acting as a wireless bridge to the main Linksys router, so I put the 2MB/s(ish) transfer rate down to wireless networking problems.</p><p>I recently bought a couple of Powerline adapters to try and improve the streaming. They didn&#039;t . I was still getting 2MB/s max transfer. So I thought I&#039;d investigate. I&#039;ve now found that ALL the devices can only communicate with each other at a maximum of about 20mbps. I&#039;ve got this maximum using both &#039;iperf&#039; and by netcatting /dev/zero between devices, as well as ftp&#039;ing, scp&#039;ing and NFS&#039;ing between devices.</p><p>Even single hops (e,g, PC to router) will only get 2MB/s. I had a go at changing things like TCP window sizes through /proc/sys/..., in line with what I&#039;d found from google, but I get no difference. I think something else is wrong, and I&#039;ve no idea what it could be. Might cable quality be a factor? I&#039;ve connected everything to everything, using about 5 different cables, and everything still gives the same 2MB/s max throughput.</p><p>I&#039;m sure there must be something stupid I&#039;ve missed, but for the life of me I can&#039;t think what it is.</p><p>I&#039;ve run ethtool on the PC, Asus and Linksys, and it comes up with Connection speed 100mbps for all the devices.<br />For instance, here&#039;s the output from &#039;ethtool&#039; on the Linksys WRT54GS:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Settings for eth0:

					<p>I can see similar speeds running iperf -s and &quot;netcating&quot; /dev/zero between the router and any PC. It never goes beyond 20.1 Mbits/sec. This happens over wired and wireless link.

Are your videos bigger than two GB/hour? I suspect not. Now, I can&#039;t really play .avi files off of my NAS as the player programs seem to want to read through the whole file before starting, maybe that is what you are seeing?

					<p>Running iperf on the router is affected by the CPU performance of the router. Two PCs communicating over the built-in switch do not involve the routers CPU. Communicating between LAN and WLAN *does* involve the routers CPU, and that&#039;s the bottleneck :-(<br />LAN to WLAN throughput on my WL-500gd is about 2.6MByte/sec.<br />If you cannot reach acceptable performance on LAN to LAN, i&#039;d the check cables of the attached devices. <br />Do you have an additional switch to test?</p>									</div>

					<p>My vague understanding is that Linux has no device drivers to make use on onboard DMA engines, so all data copying has to be done by the CPU.&nbsp; Most units have DMA engines because the CPU is not meant for these high bandwidth applications, theres just been no attempt to use them. </p><p>I dont know anything at all about the onboard switch and whether it should be able to give you fast copy speeds / bypass the CPU.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry I&#039;ve not replied. Just got back from holiday. Anyway, glad to see it&#039;s not just me that&#039;s having issues. I had the chance to run a direct file transfer between two fast PC&#039;s across the network (just the fedora media pc and a windows laptop, so no real performance testing, just sending large files across), and it got up to around 6-7 Mbytes/s, so I think that part of the problem must be trying to use a router as one end of the test (i.e. I max out the CPU). It&#039;s strange that I get exactly the same values for both routers though, since the WRT is over twice as fast (at least according to the bogomips) as the Asus.</p><p>Anyway, the reason it&#039;s a problem is that I am streaming files larger than 2gb/hour, or more specifically, raw DVB TS streams are transfered from the dreambox to a network share on the PC. I&#039;m going to get hold of a gigabit switch to directly connect the two to check if it makes a difference.</p><p>Out of interest, the dreambox is using an NFS share for it&#039;s root filesystem (which is located on the Asus). The target recording directory is then mounted on top of that as either a samba or nfs share (neither really work well). I naively thought that the rootfs being on NFS shouldn&#039;t affect performance, since read/write operations on the samba share wouldn&#039;t need communication with the root nfs. Am I wrong about this? When the kernel writes to a samba share, does it have to communicate constantly with the root fs? If so, maybe this is a problem. I&#039;ll get tcpdump on the case to see what&#039;s happening.</p><p>Thanks for your time</p><p>Beady</p><p>@mpeterson: The reason your udp is so low is that you&#039;ve got to increase the udp bandwidth (I fell for it too). Try something like:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iperf -b 100M</code></pre></div><p>You&#039;ll see lots of dropped packets (most of them actually). Keep changing the -b value until you find you don&#039;t loose packets.</p>									</div>
