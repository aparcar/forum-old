					<p>How big is your image exactly? According to your df, you have 2880 kB of flash available for Openwrt. I assume every image requires an /overlay partition (for custom configuration files), probably at least 64 kB, so that leaves 2816 kB for the image. Does yours fit in that? Otherwise you probably have bad luck... try to leave out some packages to make it fit I guess...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>avbohemen</strong> on 7 May 2012, 14:42)</p>

To make sure some amount of RAM is available for &quot;normal use&quot; tmpfs size can not grow beyond 1/2 of RAM, but if you put something on tmpfs it&#039;s removed from &quot;free ram&quot; immediately and you remove something from tmpfs is&#039;s available for other uses immediately.</p>									</div>
