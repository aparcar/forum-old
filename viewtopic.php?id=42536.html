					<p>Followed the first part of the tutorial on wiki, but copper tracks on R15 and R17 almost where striped off pcb (damed wires, still to large!). Managed to resolder the resistors thanks to capilary efect and lots of flux, but wires in there are out of question.</p><p>can i use the gpio20 and gpio18 in the sliding switch for i2c bus? i dont see much use in them. </p><p>If yes, how i define wich one is SDA or SCK?</p><p>And i would like to keep the status led on, is it realy necessary to remove leds and buttons kernel modules? cant i just remove the sliding switch module?</p><p>thanks 4 ur time.</p>									</div>

					<p>You need to physically remove the switch, and get rid of of gpio-buttons.<br />You might need to edit the source, but see how you get on.<br />The LED kmod shouldn&#039;t need to be touched.</p>									</div>
