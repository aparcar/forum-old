					<p>Hi,</p><p>I just bought the new ASUS RT-N66U.<br />Some of my test results and some Linux-OS data can be found in my post here:<br /><a href="http://forums.smallnetbuilder.com/showthread.php?t=6446">http://forums.smallnetbuilder.com/showthread.php?t=6446</a></p><p>The source code for this firmware is available on Asus homepage.<br />It&#039;s written that this is an open-source router.</p><p>When can we expect OpenWRT support for this router?<br />I&#039;m running OpenWRT on my DIR-825 today and like it more than DD-WRT. Would like to install and use OpenWRT on this router as well.</p><p>Regards<br />Geraner</p>									</div>

It&#039;s just a &quot;wl&quot; - well known closed source driver. You&#039;re partially right about using ancient kernel. DD-WRT doesn&#039;t have to use it, because they have access to the &quot;wl&quot; sources and recompile it against whatever they want. We could only use &quot;wl&quot; from DD-WRT and stick to the kernel they&#039;re using (hoping it isn&#039;t modified too much). This is not an option for OpenWrt.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Hauke said here: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/10852">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/10852</a> that Ethernet is now working and that was about 3 months ago.
