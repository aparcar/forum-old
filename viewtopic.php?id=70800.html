					<p>Hello, I am new on this forum, And I am here asking if there&#039;s a way to config a OpenWrt Router to permit that anyone in the LAN (preferably anyone connecting through WiFi) can access ONLY to WhatsApp servers, so nobody can open Any other website, just use Whatsapp. It&#039;s servers are kinda public, so it&#039;s only a matter of implementing that, but My question is, how do I that? Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>

Guess I didn&#039;t need to whireshark those after all. <br />Hopefully this will block VPN from working since I am ONLY permitting those IPs....and if it doesn&#039;t....at least I tried.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Shyiro</strong> on 13 May 2017, 02:05)</p>
