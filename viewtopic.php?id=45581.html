					<p>Hopefully someone can tell me where I&#039;m going wrong with this one, its not my first OpenWRT device but, I&#039;m at a bit of a loss, firstly some details .... as the board has <strong> no working Ethernet configuration </strong> , I&#039;m building from trunk so that I can include extra packages when flashing, the build is <strong> Bleeding Edge, r37482 </strong> and I am of course using ttl-serial access, my primary issue revolves around the Ethernet, or lack thereof. The switch behaves perfectly during CFE, accepting pings from all &#039;lan&#039; ports but not the wan, and it functions quite happily as a &#039;dumb bridge&#039; passing data between my pc and the rest of the network while they are both connected to the &#039;lan ports&#039; ( no traffic passing by if one cable is connected to the &#039;wan&#039; port ), but after CFE, the router will not respond at all to the Ethernet. it seems to be detected at boot indicated by : </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> [    0.564000] b53_common: found switch: BCM63xx, rev 0 </code></pre></div><p> but start to go haywire when the interface is brought &#039;UP&#039;, the command </p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>swconfig dev eth0 show | grep port</p></blockquote></div><p> gives </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>       ports: 0x0136

					<p>Hi, I built a working firmware for this router.</p><p>- Switch with vlans works<br />- Built firmware for upgrading via luci, or Netgear http firmware, works<br />- Both wifi radios work, I used broadcom wl drivers. I made light tests and can only say the performance is acceptable<br />- Bult against AA, 12.09 stable version, for compatibility of installing new packages.<br />- All leds working<br />- All buttons working<br />- Openwrt failsafe mode works using &quot;Restore Factory Settings&quot; button at the bottom of the router.<br />- The NAND flash still have no drivers, it doesn&#039;t work<br />- ADSL/VDSL doesn&#039;t work, and never will, no drivers available.<br />- SMP doesn&#039;t work, next versions of Openwrt may include support for&nbsp; both CPU cores in BCM6368 SoCs, but currently there is a known bug causing corruption in the NOR flash. This is well known by Pteridium</p><p>The existing code for 96368MVWG board isn&#039;t for this router. It seems Netgear used this board ID but using a totally different board layout, the existing code for 96368MVWG shouldn&#039;t be used, it is already ok but it is for other routers. The firmware I provide is built with an overriding board ID through a CFEFIXUP.</p><p>I&#039;ve included the firmware, patches and the Netgear utility to convert the OpenWrt firmware to a Netgear .chk firmware:<br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-EMoBe-_OdBUEo2NHp6eWVjbmc/edit?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-EMoB … sp=sharing</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>danitool</strong> on 27 Dec 2013, 18:30)</p>
