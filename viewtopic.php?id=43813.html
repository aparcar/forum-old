					<p>Please help me in understanding the images created by building OpenWRT source files and also how to use them for my Speedport W303V Type A. </p><p>With great difficulty I compiled the latest OpenWRT code&nbsp; on my computer. It produced the following files in &quot;bin\lantiq&quot; directory:</p><p>&nbsp; openwrt-lantiq-xway-ARV7525PW-uImage&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (1171 KB)<br />&nbsp; openwrt-lantiq-xway-ARV7525PW-squashfs.image (3073 KB)<br />&nbsp; openwrt-lantiq-xway-ARV7525PW-jffs2-64k.image&nbsp; (3713 KB)<br />&nbsp; openwrt-lantiq-xway-ARV7525PW-jffs2-128k.image(3841 KB)<br />&nbsp; openwrt-lantiq-xway-ARV7525PW-jffs2-256k.image(3841 KB)</p><p>Since I am new to OpenWRT, few simple questions:<br />&nbsp; Which files are important? <br />&nbsp; Which one should be used a &quot;firmwire&quot;?<br />&nbsp; <br />Thanks in advance for any help that you can give me.

					<p>No, I could not succeed in making my Speedport W 303 V Typ A a OpenWrt machine!&nbsp; (Image could be loaded but the box will not boot up! So I had to load the original image.) Only an expert can do this kind of tricky tasks. So I gave up the idea of having a OpenWrt box!</p><p>Good Luck! (if you wish to continue with the work)</p>									</div>
