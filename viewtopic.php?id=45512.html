					<p>I need to be straightened out once and for all about switch configuration on a BCM6358 based board that contains a BCM5325 switch.</p><p>Environment: Attitude Adjustment 12.09 running on BCM6358 based Westell 7501 router with BCM5325 switch<br />Router has 5 physical ports: 4 labeled as LAN, one labeled as WAN, no DSL ports (not that I would have cared if it did).</p><p>Most documentation state to enter the following in the /etc/config/network to get networking:</p><p>root@OpenWrt:/# cat /etc/config/network<br />config interface &#039;loopback&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;lo&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;127.0.0.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask &#039;255.0.0.0&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth1.0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option type &#039;bridge&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;192.168.1.1&#039;</p><br /><p>config interface &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;dhcp&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option _orig_ifname &#039;eth0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option _orig_bridge &#039;false&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth1.1&#039;</p><p>config switch eth1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan0 &#039;1 2 3 4 5t&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan1 &#039;0 5t&#039;</p><br /><p>However this does not seem to work.</p><p>I found robocfg (which I was suprised to find out was not included in the standard menuconfig setup for 63xx platform) and installed it, afterwords successfully configured the VLANs based on robocfg&#039;s suggestion in its help, which seems to be what the &#039;config switch eth1&quot; section in etc/config/network should have done, and that worked, however the switch configuration did not survive rebooting the router; all ports reverted to being assigned to VLAN0.&nbsp; How do I get the configuration to stick, short of having to stick it in an init file somewhere?</p><p>swconfig dev eth1 doesn&#039;t find a switch.&nbsp; Perhaps I am not selecting the correct &quot;dev&quot; parameter, but there&#039;s not much to go on in where to look to find the correct parameter for &#039;dev&#039;<br />I assumed that perhaps kmod-swconfig was needed for swconfig to work but kmod-swconfig fails to install via opkg.&nbsp; Would that be because it needs to be compiled as part of the kernel?</p><p>I thougth I read somewhere where there&#039;s supposed to be a page in LUCI for switch configuration.&nbsp; How do I get that, or is it compatible with Robocfg?</p><p>The 7501 can&#039;t run the CFE bootloader, as the CFE does not support the flash chips on the 7501, but with hardcoding CFE/BCM tag information into the sourcecode, I was able to get OpenWRT to run via the proprietary Westell bootloader.&nbsp; &nbsp;I configured a new board under the 63xx platform using the 96358GW2 as a template, hardcoding the NVRAM to provide the new board name to the kernel and configuring the MTD partitions as the kernel would have expected it based on CFE boot.</p><p>Here&#039;s what I have for the board definition in board_bcm963xx.c:</p><p>static struct board_info __initdata board_A90_750115 = {<br />&nbsp;

Would that have created a default config where the WAN is on VLAN1, and the other 4 ports on VLAN0, all tied to eth1 through the switch?</p><p>While I am at it, the buttons do not seem to be effective in getting one into failsafe mode, although through hotplug scripting, I have shown that OpenWRT is indeed aware of the buttons.&nbsp; Perhaps there is other code somewhere that I need to patch for this new board?</p>									</div>

					<p>Incidentally, I have been able to confirm that the switch is tied to eth1 on the SoC since if I eliminate any reference to VLANs, configure eth1 with a static IP, I can ping that IP from any of the ports, including the physical WAN port, so I know that all 5 ports are controlled by the 5325, which in turn is connected to eth1 on the 6358, and that eth0 is effectively useless.</p><p>My goal is to have a standard working router from default OpenWRT firmware install.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>danman32</strong> on 29 Jul 2013, 03:44)</p>
