					<p>Heey all,</p><p>My goal is to put a router (wndr3700) with connected webcams on a hub to stream video feeds. I started with extending the cams with cat5/6 cables, didn&#039;t got recognized afterwards because of the length</p><p>Then tried to use mjpeg-streamer and fswebcam, but due to not supported mjpeg webcams I canceled that idea because of cpu overload.</p><br /><p>Now I&#039;m using USBIP to remote connect my webcams trough lan to my server. Which will encode and stream it with webcamxp. It all works fine when viewing 1 webcam at a time, but when opening 2 webcam feeds, it disconnects in the command window. </p><p>The notification on windows 10:<br />usbip err: usbip_windows.c: 444 (write_to_dev) read from sock ret 0 not equal a usbip_header</p><p>On windows xp the notification also says: <br />[usbip_xmit] recv&lt;&gt; returned -1 -1 error 10053: The software on your hostcomputer has the connection disconnected</p><br /><p>So my busspeeds aren&#039;t allowing 2 or more webcams at a time. My idea is to lower the speeds of the webcam if possible. </p><p>- perhaps by forcing the cams to get recognized as 1.1 devices <br />- By setting maximum speeds or bitrate in openwrt host<br />- Changing settings in device manager on client machine<br />- I saw this coming by: cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/usb1/speed ,editing the file did&#039;t allow me to save it, perhaps it IS possible?</p><br /><p>(I also saw the pogoplug with 4 usb ports, will this have a separate bus for each port or is it a hub by itself as well)</p><br /><p>It doesn&#039;t have to be perfect as long as some video comes trough at a lower rate or quality, because I found out, remote connecting webcams is a sh*tt* work and seems almost impossible by now. Or just give up and get some ip cameras:P</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>trnase</strong> on 25 Mar 2015, 20:30)</p>

					<p>I tried it with an usb 1.1 hub. At least if I plug in de camera&#039;s is says on openwrt it&#039;s not running at full speed.<br />But same problem accures, ofcourse....</p><p>Lowering the resolution isn&#039;t possible, when I change it, it keeps remaining on the same settings. I tried to use a logitecht m4000 camera because that one is better then the ones I am using, but got some problems getting that one to work at all..&nbsp; And I think it won&#039;t work with all the options i&#039;ve tried already...</p><p>I think this is a project without a happy end. I think i&#039;m just going to look for an mini laptop or something and just plug it all in that machine and done.&nbsp; Power usage of an eeepc is just 10watts anyways...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>trnase</strong> on 26 Mar 2015, 16:00)</p>
