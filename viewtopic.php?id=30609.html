					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;ve just started dabbling with LuCi (0.10.x) on OpenWRT trunk and would appreciate some advice. I&#039;d like to create a very cut-down user interface that would just provide System Status, WiFi AP Configuration, Firmware Upgrade and Reboot functionality.</p><p>What would be the best way to approach this? I realise I could just hack away at the /usr/lib/lua/luci directory, but I&#039;m keen to know what the recommended approach is.</p><p>Also, once I&#039;ve got it working on one device, what&#039;s the best way to fold this back into a firmware build? Would it involve creating a luci-admin-custom package in the packages/* directory?</p><p>Any suggestions would be appreciated!</p>									</div>
