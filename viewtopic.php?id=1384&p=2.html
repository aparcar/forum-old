					<p>Some more observations:</p><p>1) Just in case anyone who is looking at my NVRAM contents is wondering, no, I&#039;m not insane; boot_wait is set to off not because I want it that way, but because PMON in this unit automatically changes it BACK every time I set it to on.&nbsp; Yes, it is VERY annoying.&nbsp; I probably won&#039;t be able to do anything about it until I get a JTAG header soldered on or something and can put on a bootloader that won&#039;t do that.</p><p>2) Just to bring this slightly back on-topic, I ran some more experiments today.&nbsp; I wondered if what was causing my particular unit to crash was the binary driver for the Prism card.&nbsp; So I removed it and ran just with Ethernet connectivity.&nbsp; Then I set up a local computer on my network with Apache and a CGI script that piped out data from /dev/urandom and then used wget on the WRT54AG to stream this data and output it to /dev/null; that way I could have a constant stream of random whatever being sent to the WRT54AG.&nbsp; Even only doing this, with no wireless being used at all, the unit managed to crash several minutes later.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t seem to be the wireless driver.&nbsp; And as I pointed out in the other thread, I&#039;ve already ruled out the ethernet driver by trying out three different revisions of it (one of which was supposedly the fix to the problem).&nbsp; Others have already reported that the various gcc 3.4 builds of experimental haven&#039;t fixed the problem for them, either.</p><p>I&#039;m about to tear my hair out!&nbsp; I was going to put the &quot;old&quot; official Linksys firmware back on, but I put it off hoping that someone would stumble upon the answer, but it doesn&#039;t look like that has happened yet and I certainly haven&#039;t gotten any closer to the answer myself, so I will most likely try 1.07 out again in the next day or two.&nbsp; Linksys has, unfortunately, still been eearily silent about my requests to have them release the sources to 1.08 or even just a binary.&nbsp; Grrr.</p><p>-- Nathan</p>									</div>

					<p>TX is no problem, but only RX:</p><p>On my WL-500G I have same problems, like NathanA. I have done some tests with netio (freshmeat.net/projects/netio/) and found out that the box only crashes when revieving data blocks larger then 1KB, TX is no problem and works with about 2Mbit/s stable. </p><p>This problem not only appear with th propritary et (in any version), but also when I&#039;m using the open source driver b44. So I think the &quot;large file transfer reboot bug&quot; problem on WL-500g (BCM4710 125MHz ...) is not the driver, but may by an buffer overflow in an other part of the kernel network implementation ( ip layer?).</p>									</div>

					<p>fwiw, clkfreq=216 does not work on my older wrt54g v2.0.&nbsp; its too fast for the device.&nbsp; it was still salvagable either as described here using boot_wait and another firmware as well as just holding the reset button to restore minimal defaults into nvram.</p>									</div>

					<p>gps, I think that the 216MHz clock rate was only ever meant to help out with v2.2 and above devices...</p><p>As far as my WRT54AG saga goes, get this: I rolled back to the official Linksys firmware for my device (much to my chagrin...I still only have the very b0rken v1.07 in my possession...it sucks), and it is SOLID AS A ROCK stable.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been sitting here now for over 30 minutes, conducting the same constant speedtest that I used previously to repeatedly and demonstratably crash OpenWRT as well as listening to a 128kbit/s MP3 stream at the same time, and nary a hiccup can be observed.&nbsp; With OpenWRT, I was never able to get more than 5 minutes out of it without it giving up its lunch.</p><p>So there is SOMETHING about OpenWRT that does not agree with this piece of hardware.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s an issue with the kernel or with the compiler used to build the kernel.&nbsp; Perhaps I&#039;ll try to &quot;backport&quot; the Linksys kernel to the latest OpenWRT snapshot and see what happens...</p><p>-- Nathan</p>									</div>

					<p>Don&#039;t suppose anyone has managed to solve this for the WRT54g v1.1? Mine reboots after a few hundred meg of data is transferred over the wifi interface and needs to be power-cycled to use wifi again. Tried overclocking to 150mhz but that just made it worse. </p><p>Everything was fine on the old build of openwrt I was using!

					<p>It&#039;s not the fault of openwrt. It&#039;s the fault of the new ethernet/switch driver which has been integrated into experimental. The reason this driver is used, is because it supports both V2.0 and V2.2 hardware.</p>									</div>
