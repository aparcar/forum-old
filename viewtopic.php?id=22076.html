					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have a kamikaze router acting as a client of another wireless access point. For some reason, from time to time the link is broken and it is only reestablished some hours later or even needs a router reboot in order to associate again.</p><p>I was wondering if there is a way to create a keep alive function in wich the client router pings every specified time the gateway&#039;s IP adress and forces a self reboot in case it gets no response from the gateway.</p><p>Another option could be forcing a wl join to the access point SSID.</p><p>How can this be done? Crontab?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>
