					<p>Issue: I want to block access to my NAS from an increasing number of (IoT) things on my LAN. I want to whitelist devices (by static-lease ip or MAC) that have permission to access my NAS. I am a noob to OpenWRT (having just switched from DD-WRT).</p><p>My preference is to use LuCI to achieve what I want to do, but I&#039;m happy to manually edit &quot;/etc/config/firewall&quot; if that makes more sense (I assume it will flow back through?).</p><p>With reference to <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/firewall">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/firewall</a> I came up with the following rule set. I have not tried implementing it yet (my limited knowledge suggests that &quot;option src/dest&quot; can&#039;t use the same zone, as that isn&#039;t a real interface), but it captures in concept what I&#039;m trying to do:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config rule
        option src              lan
        option dest             lan
        option src_ip           192.168.1.101         &lt;= white-listed device
        option dest_ip          192.168.1.99          &lt;= NAS
        option target           ACCEPT

config rule
        option src              lan
        option dest             lan
        option src_ip           192.168.1.102         &lt;= white-listed device
        option dest_ip          192.168.1.99          &lt;= NAS
        option target           ACCEPT

config rule
        option src              lan
        option dest             lan
        option dest_ip          192.168.1.99
        option target           REJECT</code></pre></div><p>Can anyone help me configure what I&#039;m trying to do? Firstly, I guess, is confirming what I want to do is possible. Secondly, whether the Firewall is the place to achieve it. And, thirdly, how do I configure the Firewall (or the correct tool I should be using instead).</p><p>Another idea I had was to create a new Zone for IoT things, in which they can talk to each other and the WAN, and devices on my primary LAN can talk into, but I have even less idea as to how to set that up correctly (quite a different beast to the Guest Zone)...</p><p>Thank you, in advance, for any assistance you can give.</p>									</div>

					<p>In openwrt typically devices on the same network talk directly to each other, so the firewall will not be able to see traffic on the typically included LAN switch nor on each of the wireless networks. In addition per default openwrt bridges the wifi and LAN interfaces, so they act at one big network where netfilter typically can not be used.Note the last is not exactly true the ebtables tool can actually be used on a bridge, but that still will only work if your NAS lives on a different &quot;segment&quot; than the hosts you want to isolate, NAS on LAN and all I(di)oT devices on WIFI. Also I believe that ebtables is not really exposed in the GUI.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What about using encryption to access the NAS, so that all devices that want to connect need the correct certificate or password beforehand as an alternative? Then the router would not care and you would handle the &quot;white-listing&quot; on the NAS...</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for your reply, moeller0 - I was suspicious that UCI Firewall / netfilter was the way to go here - your suggestion makes more sense. Cheers.</p>									</div>
