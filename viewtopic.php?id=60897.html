					<p>Hi, I need to copy Certificate for wired authentification at my uni onto the router. The general linux setup guide suggest to copy it to &quot;/etc&quot;.</p><p>I tried using winscp for it but it returned that the fodler is write only. Same thing for the .conf file which i need to put in /etc aswell.</p><p>So i wanted to ask what directory i should actually use for the certificate and the conf file. Also where would i put the cron job needed for this since the default folder for that is within /etc as well.</p><p>And another question. Can I prepare the .conf file and cron job on a PC and copy it with winscp or am i forced to use vi via putty to not get complications?</p>									</div>

					<p>/etc is not read-only.</p><p>You can easily create config files on a PC, if the PC runs Linux ;-)</p><p>As for Windows, you can edit files using WinSCP, if you edit them in the right side of WinSCP. This way you edit files directly in the router. If you edit files in the left side, you will have problems with Windows end-of-line character.</p>									</div>

					<p>I tried to create the conf file with winscp and vi with putty and both times i wasn&#039;t able to write. I thought that was a feature of squashfs. That it is read only and a part of the flash is writeable.</p>									</div>
