					<p>Anyone has an idea on how to get more txpower in the wr841n? I used the jow reghack but I can only get up to 23 dbm, there were claims of 27 dBm on the same router by using a hacked art partition or whatever, if so can someone share the hacked ART? I really need more txpower because the router is not placed correctly for best signal and I can&#039;t move it elsewhere, so the signal nearly disappears at only about 8 meters from it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>user5077</strong> on 20 Dec 2015, 08:45)</p>
