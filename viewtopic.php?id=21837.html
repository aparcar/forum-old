					<p>Could someone summarize the current status of support/development for the Atheros 8316 Gigbit Ethernet switch? I understand these are used in both the RB-450G and the RouterStation Pro and as a new RouterStation Pro owner I&#039;m interested in doing what I can to get support for this switch.</p>									</div>

					<p>I tried emailing Felix who wrote the 8216 (non-gigabit) Atheros switch driver to see how I could help and received no response. I&#039;m not really a developer but I&#039;m willing to do what I can to support getting the 8316 switch supported (it is also used in the Routerboard 450G and a couple other devices). I thinking that one possibility would be to see if Atheros is willing to release the SDK to someone who could work on the switch control software. An example of the driver for the 8216 switch can be found at <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/target/linux/generic-2.6/files/drivers/net/phy/ar8216.h">https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/t … y/ar8216.h</a> and I would imagine the 8316 would be fairly similar.</p>									</div>

					<p>i got some documentation (under NDA) from Atheros, I&#039;m seeing what can be done with it. I&#039;m still not completely sure if there is enough documentation for what needs to be done. I haven&#039;t had a chance to look at it in detail. I got some GPL snippet&#039;s from Atheros also, which i reckon i could upload somewhere, but i want to consult with someone before i get in trouble <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Unfortunately, I&#039;m also not entirely sure how much i will need to change in the 8216 driver, but definately looks like the 8316 is VERY similar to the 8216.

I would also be willing to work on this development if someone gave me some initial direction.</p></blockquote></div><p>I didn&#039;t understand sth. If this development project&nbsp; complete with success, the 3 swithc ports will work as separrate lan interfaces, or they will continue to work as switch-vlan?</p></blockquote></div><p>As far as I know chipset AR7161 has only two ethernet interfaces by it selfs -- eth0 and eth1. RB450G (and RB750G too) has AR7161 chip and AR8316 integrated into one board. eth0 is directly connected to Eth1/PoE of RB450G and eth1 is connected with internal port of the AR8316. So in a best case we can get only two real ethernet interfaces or one real and 4 vlan&#039;ed ports or several vlans or etc.</p><p>At this time switch does not work in openwrt. So we can not use eth1 at all.</p>									</div>

					<p>Just to clarify a little (this is my understanding, please let me know if I am wrong)... the switch works (RouterStation Pro at least) you just can not manage the switch. In my system with the RouterStation Pro all of the ports that are exposed from the switch work and they operate like a dumb switch is connected to the eth1 interface. If you check the status of the eth1 interface it always states that it is &#039;up&#039;, because it is connected to the AR8316 switch. You can not get the status of the external ports because we can not access the ship. </p><p>I think that we would like to be able to configure the switch so that we can read back the status of the individual ports as well as provide the ability to configure the features of the chip (VLANs and such). In openwrt we could then map these VLAN interfaces to make it appear that they are &#039;real&#039; ports instead of switched ports.</p>									</div>

					<p>Exactly true, Paul.&nbsp; I was just pointing out that on the RB450G, you can&#039;t even use a port if you boot from flash because the switch isn&#039;t initialized at all.&nbsp; So there are two issues:</p><p>1) On RB450G (and other RouterBoards with the AR8316), get ANY standalone functionality so it is at least up to the functional level of the RS Pro.</p><p>2) On ALL platforms, get full switch capability.</p><p>I guess my point is that even if a new switch driver is works perfectly for the RS Pro, it won&#039;t help anybody with an RB450G until the initialization issue is resolved. Obviously this can be done because RouterOS does it.</p><p>So UBNT initializes the switch in Redboot for use by the kernel, and Mikrotik does something in the kernel itself.</p>									</div>
