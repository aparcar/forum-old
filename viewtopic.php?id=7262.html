					<p>I&#039;m running RC5 and try to use cisco vpn client (4.8) from my laptop. </p><p>The vpn connection established OK. but vpn traffic doesn&#039;t pass through. I can&#039;t ping anywhere but the vpn server. When I check the stat of the vpn client I found that both &quot;received bytes&quot; and &quot;decrypted bytes&quot; are 0 which seems that my router blocked/dropped all the incoming vpn packets. </p><p>I searched extensively on this forum and from other places, below are what I did<br />1. VPN works, I hook up my lappy to cable modem directly and everything is OK. <br />2. I disabled the qos by remove /etc/init.d/S50qos, so nbd&#039;s qos issue shouldn&#039;t matter here.<br />3. I followed the MiniHowto adding &quot;iptables -t nat -A postrouting_rule -p 50 -j ACCEPT&quot; and &quot;iptables -t nat -A postrouting_rule -p 51 -j ACCEPT&quot;. No effect.<br />4. I installed kmod-ipt-nat-extra. No effect.<br />5. Did same thing chapelhill posted in <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=5813">this</a> thread. No effect</p><p>Any idea would be very appeciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi!</p><p>I&#039;m using cisco vpn 4.6 + the fon openwrt (0.6.6)...</p><p>I have also done the iptables modifications, and after that the cisco vpn still has the problem.</p><p>But I have found a strange workaround. If I donwload a media stream from a radio from a different host connected to the same fon router than the vpn connection works from my laptop to my company through the router... It works if I start the <br />wget http://mediastream -O /dev/null <br />command on my router, and after that I start to connect from my laptop through VPN...</p><p>If I close the mediastream, the vpn connection breaks...</p><p>Can somebody understand this??? What does the continous download do with the router?</p><p>[2006/okt/26]<br />It seems to me that the root cause is that pppd breaks the connection, and after that the vpn is dead...</p><p>Now I have started a ping loop, to have some minimal traffic, but I think I have to reconfigure the pppd, to keep the connection alive without any traffic...</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>BR,<br />Sandor</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>esanya</strong> on 26 Oct 2006, 12:33)</p>
