					<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>I am experiencing a problem similar to the one described at <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/6853">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/6853</a> . I have a board based on the Ralink RT5350 chip, 32MB of RAM, 8MB of Flash and I am trying to use various 3G/4G modems with it. The kernel is 3.8.13, the firmware is based on <a href="https://github.com/kaechele/openwrt">https://github.com/kaechele/openwrt</a> . </p><p>Some of the 3G modems are only detected if they are inserted _after_ the board is powered up. If they are already in the USB port at the time the board gets power, the system acts as if there is nothing inserted. A soft reboot doesn&#039;t fix it. Removing the 3G modem and re-inserting it makes it show up.</p><p>The modems that exhibit this behavior are:</p><p>Pantech UML295 <br />Franklin U770 <br />Novatel MC930D<br />Netgear 340U and 341U</p><p>The same problem also appears when using the standard Ralink firmware (using Ralink&#039;s 3.6.0 SDK, not OpenWRT) but only with the Netgear 340U and the 341U. The other 3 (Pantech UML295, Franklin U770 and Novatel MC930D) are detected fine.</p><p>I suspect it is some sort of timing issue. The Ralink firmware appears to put the USB port into power-saving mode (by setting UDEV_RST and UHST_RST to 1 in the RSTCTRL register, then turning off the associated clock by setting UPHY0_CLK_EN to 0) at boot time. The OpenWRT firmware appears to do something similar (the exact patch is this one: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/target/linux/ramips/patches-3.8/0204-owrt-MIPS-ralink-add-usb-platform-support.patch?rev=36260">https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/t â€¦ ?rev=36260</a> ) but it appears to do so at a later time (when the USB port is enabled).</p><p>Has anyone else seen this before (on this particular chip or a similar one)? On this particular board there is no GPIO to turn off the power to the USB port, so if the power fails and the board + modem reboots, it will not be detected until someone physically unplugs the modem and plugs it back in.</p><p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</p><p>Thank you,<br />Razvan</p>									</div>

					<p>Already tried that, there is no GPIO attached to the USB power. I&#039;ve also talked to the manufacturer and they claim they didn&#039;t install a GPIO line to control the USB power (but can modify the board for us for a fee, obviously <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> ).</p>									</div>

					<p>If your manufacture not planed Power for USB, so how we can help you? Only way find place where you can tak 5V and connect it to USB power pin. or that resister respond for this pin, but then you need to show good quality pictures from your board</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m hoping for a software solution that would at least make _some_ of the modems work (that is bring it to the same situation as the Ralink firmware that works with all the modems I mentioned except the Netgear 340U and 341U). There must be something that the Ralink firmware does and the OpenWRT firmware doesn&#039;t that makes modems like the Pantech UML295 not appear (fail to handshake) on the OpenWRT version.</p><p>The USB power cut would be a last resort - it would not get to the bottom of the issue but instead simply simulate a re-insert of the modem. I would rather get it solved in software (if at all possible).</p>									</div>

					<p>I suspect my problem is the usb-modem takes a little time to init and the &quot;usbmode -s&quot; is not done yet when devices are assigned. I don&#039;t have good enough understading of the boot process I&#039;m afraid.

					<p>Hi to everyone,</p><p>I installed BB rc3 on my tl-1043-nd V1 and having the only chance to access internet through a 3g modem (vacation) I installed the needed packages but:</p><p>-To allow the mode switching I had to add the file /etc/modules.d/60-usbserial with the instruction: usbserial vendor=0x12d1 product=0x1506 (my modem is a huawei E3131) as described by someone on another post</p><p>-I experienced the same issues described by Widmark on post 17 and I think I solved the problem with following commands in rc.local:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ifdown 3g<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; /etc/init.d/usbmode restart<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; sleep&nbsp; 5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ifup 3g<br />where 3g is the name I have given to the 3g interface. I would very much like to try the solution Widmark has adopted, but I&#039;m not so sure about where to set the sleep command in /sbin/hotplug-call, can anyone help me?</p><p>-The 3g connection becomes VERY VERY slow randomly and the only way to restore normal speed (without rebooting) is to reconnect to the isp (through LUCI or command line). But sometimes the benefits of this action doesn&#039;t last more then a couple of minutes and I have to reconnect again so that it becomes impossible to work on internet. Does anyone have this same problem? Btw I had this same issue I&#039;m describing here with BB rc2 and the latest version of AA.</p><p>Many thanks for the help</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>skyarrow92</strong> on 4 Sep 2014, 13:48)</p>

					<p>I know this topic is quiet old, but i face the exact same problem as described in the first post from user drazvan.<br />Nothing gets detected or shown in dmesg,lsusb or cat /sys/kernel/debug/usb/devices.<br />Only replugging after boot solves the issue.</p><p>In my case it&#039;s a HooToo HT-TM02 with a Ralink chip. Modem is a ZTE MF823.</p><p>Any progress on your side drazvan.</p><p>I&#039;m using LEDE 17.01 at the moment but same problem with Chaos Chalmer.</p><p>I&#039;ve opened a ticket at LEDE Bugs:</p><p>ID 661</p><p>Any suggestions for me.</p><p>THX</p>									</div>
