					<p>Regarding this problem and after many tries and different approaches, I was able to change the direction, value and resistor type.<br />However, this kind of change is not visible with the command &quot;cat /sys/kernel/debug/gpio&quot;, only exporting the gpio to sysfs and doing a cat on its properties I can check that something is different. Also, this didn&#039;t solve the DisplayLink chip problem and with this change, even if I try to issue the previous commands or force an reset or enable/disable on the usb enable gpio, I cannot see the device being enumerated (neither after rebooting as before).</p><p>I am currently testing with an AP148 board (Qualcomm Reference Board Design) which is fully supported by OpenWrt...and this is the situation:<br />- custom image with linux kernel version 3.18: usb works fine and enumerates an usbdisk properly;<br />- custom image with linux kernel v4.1: bootlog shows that the usb hub are enumerated and loaded successfuly (lsusb can list them also) but when I connect my usbdisk, after one or two silent seconds, I receive an &quot;usb usb1-port1: connect-debounce failed&quot; error message; after this error, nothing related with usb works (connecting/disconnecting, ls command, whatever...)<br />- custom image with linux k4.4: works perfectly...</p><p>Since this is not due to an hardware faulty, I have checked the device tree and the patches applied.<br />Since I didn&#039;t found anything, I am suspecting that it could be something on the usbcore stack or the xhci driver.<br />Has anyone experienced this error or have knowledge of some patch for it?<br />Any additional suggestions where I can look and check why the K4.1 does not behave normally?</p><p>This board does not have the DisplayLink internal chip connected so I am not debugging that particular problem. However, this same message also happens on my other board/router, reason why I was suspecting about the gpio.</p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>
