					<p>I had my old WRT54G router messed with last time by some irate neighbour, and I decided that I needed to password-protect it.&nbsp; So, after I picked up another router (I&#039;m still trying to de-brick the last one) I decided to compile the firmware with all the options turned on.&nbsp; Now, I have a working router, except for the fact that when I telnet it, it asks me for a username and password.</p><p>What makes matters worse is that it was running new firmware before, and I couldn&#039;t turn on the boot_wait. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>Is there anything else I could try first before debricking it and transferring new firmware?&nbsp; To prevent this in the future, where in buildroot would I shove a /etc/passwd file?</p>									</div>
