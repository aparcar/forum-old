					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;ve started tinkering with an Asus WL700Ge router in order to get a custom firmware on it. I started with OpenWrt which I can now compile and also flash using TFTP, however the build does not seem to function on the router (the router starts blinking as if it is in &#039;ezsetup mode&#039;). When I put the Asus firmware back (again using TFTP) the router functions as normal. So my conclusion is that the firmware is not correct / appropriate for the router. I want to fix this by debugging it through a serial connection between my PC and the router. I used these pages to add this interface:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://static.freesa.org/WL-700gE/">http://static.freesa.org/WL-700gE/</a><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://wl500g.info/showthread.php?t=17271">http://wl500g.info/showthread.php?t=17271</a></p><p>I&#039;ve used both pin setups (first says Tx, Rx, GnD, second says Rx, Tx, GnD). As for the serial communication I&#039;m using a Eminent EM1116 USB to serial converter cable. The problem is that in either case the router does not seem to boot (no lights start blinking) and I receive nothing on my serial port...</p><p>Does anyone have any thoughts?</p><p>Thanks you in advance,<br />Frens Jan</p>									</div>

					<p>You serial adapter seems to provide standard RS-232C voltage levels, whereas the WL-700gE uses 3,3V TTL.<br />You will need an adapter with integrated voltage converter, usually found in data cables for mobile phones.<br />There are data cables with USB interfaces or plain serial ones (e. g. Nokia DLR-3P).</p>									</div>

					<p>Anyhow, the ASUS WL-700g Encore is not supported because of the little 2MB flash is too less even for the basic system you need to pivot_root to the HDD.</p><p>Minimum for OpenWrt is 4MB flash and 16MB RAM.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Dogge</strong> on 11 Jul 2009, 12:53)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the info! As for the small flash: I was aware of that and was planning to use the HDD indeed. As for memory it should have 64mb so that should work... I&#039;ll go and find me some mobile phone data cable then <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
