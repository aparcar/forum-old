					<p>my tunnel to sixxs.net is running. also radvd is running. All clients get an ipv6-adress and are able to ping <a href="http://www.kame.net">www.kame.net</a> or use ipv6 in firefox etc.pp.<br />also i can ping my ipv6-adress of the router (ip from tunnel-end and ip from my subnet). But i&#039;m not able to ping any client behind the router. ip6tables standard policy for input/output/forward is ACCEPT. /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/*/forward is 1. * = br1 (bridge vlan1/tap1). </p><p>any ideas? if you need more input, let me know.</p><p>best regards</p><p>mape2k</p><p>EDIT: if i setup ipv6 on another vlan-device - it&#039;s working. It seems that the bridge is the problem.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mape2k</strong> on 15 Mar 2006, 12:59)</p>
