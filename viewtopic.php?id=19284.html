					<p>First post... Hi!</p><p>Now I am in the process of modding sevral wrt54g routers, and one of them is a WRT54GS (Version 4). </p><p>I have tried uploading the firmware via the default linksys web interface for the firmware, no luck there.</p><p>I am now trying to-do it via atftp method.</p><p>The connection to the router looks like this..</p><p>PC ---&gt; 4 port router ---&gt; WRT54GS</p><p>I have set the connection up like that so there is always a constant connection to the NIC card, so atftp always thinks there is a live connection.</p><p>I run the atftp commands (as shown on the openWRT wiki), then plug the router into the power, and get this message from atftp..</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>tftp&gt; put openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin

tftp: aborting</code></pre></div><p>From what I have read it seems when it does connect and tell me Invalid Passoword, I have connected to the tftp server on the router, not the bootloader.</p><p>I have tried this sevral times and get the same error, any ideas?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi</p><p>If I&#039;m following you here, I believe you want &quot;openwrt-wrt54gs-squashfs.bin&quot;, not &quot;openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin&quot;</p><p>Try that with the web loader and see what happens.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gloomrider</strong> on 9 Mar 2009, 17:10)</p>
