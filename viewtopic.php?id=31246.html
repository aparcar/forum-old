					<p>Hi everyone,<br />in the last few days I was trying to set up a tp-link mr3220 to work as a samba server for my home network. The sticker under the AP report it as 1.2v hardware, but the firmware say 1.0000v. Anyway, I flashed it with trunk r27832, it work like a charm. After a bit of setup I&#039;ve started to remove packages to free up the necessary space to install samba, but I noticed that even if opkg info report a certain amount of space in fact df -h report just a couple of kb of difference. I&#039;ve removed all the packages related to wireless (this AP will be connected to another AP with wireless enabled, so no matter to setup another wlan), like wireless-tools, but even if opkg info report a size of 23165, only a few kb of free space were gained. I know that there are better way to achieve what I want, extroot just to say one, but this solution would avoid to use an extra hub for the other usb port (the drive to mount can&#039;t be left attached to the AP all the time, so in this case I should use a dedicated drive for the extroot).<br />Can anyone explain why the packages size doesn&#039;t fit with the space that should change after removed it? I was thinking about something related to filesystem type, cause I&#039;ve noticed this behaviour only for the packages already installed in the image (but maybe I can be wrong). Maybe I must compile a custom version of the image without some packages?<br />Just as reference I&#039;ve used the squashfs-factory.bin image as suggested in the wiki. Actually I&#039;ve removed all the unnecessary packages then I installed the minimum requested to mount ext partition (mount work perfectly) and I&#039;m using it as an ftp server for now, but I really need to switch to samba and I still need about 50kb to install samba3 package.<br />Tanx all for support, have a good day.</p><p>P.S. Sorry for my bad english.</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenWRT uses squashfs.&nbsp; Read about squashfs at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SquashFS">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SquashFS</a></p><p>In short you cannot remove preinstalled packages such that flash space it released.&nbsp; But preinstalled packages have the advantage of being compressed in flash and therefor take a lot less flash space.&nbsp; Packages installed using opkg are not compressed on your router so they are less efficient in regards to the amount of flash space they occupy but they can be removed.</p><p>To do what you want you need to build your own version of openwrt using make menuconfig to select the packages you want preinstalled.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for the suggestion pbix, after reading a bit of wiki and docs some facts appear more clear now, as the wiki say a custom image with the necessary packages built into the flash will solve my need of space, unfortunately doesn&#039;t seem to be an ar71xx trunk version of the image builder, so I must go for the standard compiling way. Tanx again.</p>									</div>
