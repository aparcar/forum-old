					<p>Luci is a simplified GUI for adjusting settings. Luci is not meant for editing/saving/running scripts. There is a module &quot;luci-app-commands&quot; that enables you to run commands from Luci, but even then you first need to save the script to your router.</p><p>If you have a shell script, you better enter the scary world of console, i.e. the command line interpreter.</p>									</div>
