					<p>Hello.</p><p>Even if the &quot;rules&quot;-list tells me not to post &quot;can anyone help me?&quot; topics I&#039;ll dare it now because my question seems to be not that simple <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />And if this topic somehow already exists - sorry: didn&#039;t use the right search terms.</p><p>What I have:<br />2 WRT54Gv2.2 with OpenWRT whiterussian RC2 and a set up WDS-bridge with WPA (like in Jean-Michel Smith&#039;s HowTo). Works perfectly till now.<br />Nothing else (concerning OpenWRT <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />)</p><p>What I want:<br />On one of the two WRTs I&#039;d like to have the 4 LAN-ports &#039;separated&#039; from each other that means e.g.:<br />client on port1 can&#039;t connect to client on port2, and so on.<br />BUT: each of the 4 LAN-port-clients should be able to access the other WRT and/or its internet-connection.<br />That would be just like what AP-isolation is in wireless-mode.</p><p>Can anyone tell me where to look or what to setup?</p><p>The best would be a detailed step-by-step HowTo, for sure. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Would be awesome if someone could help me.

The IP scheme used should be depending on what you plan to connect to those ports... From the previous posts, I believe that you want to have 4 sepparate LAN&#039;s, is that correct? You could use a few subnets from the 192.168.x.x range, like for example:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ifconfig vlan1 192.168.10.1
ifconfig vlan2 192.168.11.1
ifconfig vlan3 192.168.12.1</code></pre></div><p>And then the machines would get IP&#039;s in the corresponding subnets, depending on what port they connect (I am not sure if dnsmasq cand handle this, but I see no reason it shouldn&#039;t).<br />If you enable ip_forward then they would be able to communicate with each-another, otherwise they will simply be invisible. For finer-control you can use the firewall rules, of course.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>Netzfetz wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Do vlan0 and vlan1 already have an assigned ip?</p></blockquote></div><p>No, you need to supply one to them via the corresponding xxx_ipaddr, xxx_proto etc. nvram variables (where xxx is the name you supply to ifup as in <strong>ifup xxx</strong>).</p>									</div>

					<p>Hmm, I think the iptables somehow don&#039;t take affect: e.g. if I make the rule &quot;<strong>iptables -A forwarding_rule -s <em>&lt;IP of a network card&gt;</em> -d <em>&lt;IP of another network card&gt;</em> -j DROP</strong>&quot; and vice versa, both cards still can ping each other perfectly (the network cards are installed on different PCs and connected to the same WRT).</p><p>So either something bypasses the iptables DROP-rules or on my setup there is something blocking the iptables.</p><p>Any idea for a rule to test that?<br />Or a solution? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>I would have to search for the link, but I think that the ebtables patch has been dropped which means that you can&#039;t use iptables to limit traffic on the bridge.&nbsp; I think you just need to recompile having switched the patch back on, but I will have to look see what the option is.&nbsp; Search the forum for ebtables and iptables and see if you can spot what I mean.</p><p>P.S. I want to do something similar to what you have done, but putting all the vlans in the same address pool.&nbsp; ie I want a single address space, but ability to limit traffic from a given port to speak to other ports.&nbsp; Can this be done?&nbsp; I found that setting multiple vlans to have the same IP address just locked me out of the box...</p>									</div>

Why dont you break the bridge, create a virtual interface<br />(xxx1 xxx2 xxx3 xxx4) on each port (including the wireless interface) with ip addresses in different subnets and use<br />a combination of ip routing and filtering?<br />This way you can use your outside (aka WAN) interface as the default gateway for all networks (functionality)<br />with the ability to restrict traffic between the networks (security).<br />You may have a look on fwbuilder (<a href="http://www.fwbuilder.org">http://www.fwbuilder.org</a>) to create your firewall - just replace the openwrt<br />firewall script (/etc/firewall.user) with the one installed by fwbuilder (/tmp/your_name_here.fw).</p>									</div>

					<p>iptables cannot influence traffic running across the bridge in kernel 2.4.&nbsp; This is fixed by the patch I referred to, which also used to be in openwrt by the way, but was removed because it caused too much of a performance hit in general (apparently).&nbsp; The patch is in kernel 2.6 by default</p><p>So you can &quot;route&quot; traffic and then iptables works again, but you can&#039;t use iptables to control traffic running across the bridge (but I see no reason why you can&#039;t limit the traffic entering and leaving the box itself, if you see the difference?)</p>									</div>
