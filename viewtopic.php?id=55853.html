					<p>If you finally decide to go to step 2, all the configuration you must do now to achieve step 1 will have been useless; those are not two steps of the same path, those are two completely different paths. So, which path will it be?</p>									</div>

An accesspoint doesn&#039;t have a WAN port. So if your TP-Link has a WAN port (logical), it&#039;s not an access point, but a (wireless) router.</p>									</div>

					<p>A general rule to deploy a router as an accesspoint (or switch), is to connect the uplink to a LAN port, not a WAN port, and switch off the DHCP server.</p><p>Of course in OpenWRT it should be possible to re-use the WAN port as a LAN port by bridging them, but maybe it&#039;s also possible to just reprogram the internal switch, to ditch the difference between the WAN and LAN ports. Which you should have to undo for step 2. So keep it easy and just use a LAN port.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>in back side have 4 yellow ethernet ports and 1 blue &quot;internet&quot; - that blue i thought is the wan port (correnct?)</p></blockquote></div><p>Correct.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>the problem is that i cant access the devices that are connected on ethernet port of old router ( i cant understand why - probably something i make wrong or i just dont know ) and i want to solve that problem ... thats all<br />my old router is 192.168.1.254<br />my new router&nbsp; is 192.168.1.1 (gateway 192.168.1.254) <br />when i make ping from ssh terminal on openwrt in internet address work perfect , when i make ping in local ip i take &quot;nothing&quot; the same when i ping the 192.168.1.254 !!! (that confuse me , because how i have internet but i cant ping the router ???!!! )</p></blockquote></div><p>You can&#039;t ping the &#039;outside router&#039;, because it&#039;s in the same subnet as your PC, and yet it isn&#039;t. Because it&#039;s in the same subnet your PC tries to connect directly, which fails, because there is a router in-between. When you try to connect to an internet host, the PC <em>knows</em> it&#039;s not in the same subnet, and just sends it to it&#039;s default gateway (192.168.1.1). That router also can&#039;t handle it directly, and sends it to <em>his</em> default gateway (192.168.1.254), and the package arrives.</p><p>BTW, in many cases this setup wouldn&#039;t work at all because the 2nd router can&#039;t decide which subnet to use to connect to it&#039;s default gateway. It has the same subnet at both sides, and so the gateway could be at both sides.<br />A router needs to have a different subnet on it&#039;s WAN port and it&#039;s LAN port(s).</p>									</div>
