					<p>If you have the option, check that its PSU still provides its nominal voltage under load. These cheap PSUs easily break over time (can&#039;t hold the voltage in use), making that a common error condition - and pretty much the only one which might still be worth fixing considering the age and slowness of the device involved (but only if you can be sure that it&#039;s really &#039;just&#039; the PSU).</p>									</div>
