					<p>Hi there,<br />I just compiled the firmware for a DIR-615 H1 router from current trunk (@36713). I want to use it as a WDS client.</p><p>The main router is shown as &quot;Associated Station&quot; in OpenWrt, but the DIR-615 does not appear in the WDS client list of the main router. Hence, I cannot associate the DIR with the main router. Also, according to the System log it seems to be stuck in a kind assoc&lt;-&gt;deassoc loop...</p><p>I am pretty sure that this worked some time (months?) ago with OpenWRT on this device, but still I am not sure if it&#039;s a bug...So can anyone confirm that WDS client mode is working? If it&#039;s a bug I would be happy to help debugging - Just tell me where to look at.</p><p>Uh and yes, this is my first post here, so please excuse me if this is the wrong place...</p><p>System Log:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>May 24 16:50:04 OpenWrt kern.info kernel: [    0.680000] VFS: Mounted root (squashfs filesystem) readonly on device 31:5.

					<p>Well, I have three routers connected using WDS. As they are different brands/chipsets the maximum encryption I could use is WEP - I know it&#039;s insecure and it reduces throughput, but better than nothing...</p><p>My hope with OpenWRT is, that I might be able to use WPA2 some day. Currently I couldn&#039;t find compatible routers for the main Vodafone box.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well the kind of WDS OpenWrt supports is not the same WDS used by proprietary systems, it will not be compatible.<br />The &quot;option wds 1&quot; setting merely enables mac80211 4addr mode, that is different to the static wds thing that only supports wep.</p>									</div>

					<p>I agree that the implementation - when using encryption- might be proprietary.</p><p>However: Even with no encryption the main router (which by the way is also based on Ralink) should recognize the DIR-615 as WDS capable device. Currently it doesn&#039;t, which might be an issue with mac80211 WDS mode indication in current trunk.</p><p>Using DD-WRT everything works correctly when turning encryption off. If encryption (doesn&#039;t matter which one) is turned on, the main router still recognizes the DIR-615, but there is no data flow.</p><p>So it&#039;s not about WEP, it seems to be a general issue.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, thats what I said above - OpenWrt uses a different WDS implementation, regardless of which crypto you use. The underlying 802.11 protocol extensions are different compared to the kind of WDS DD-Wrt or OEM firmwares implement.</p>									</div>

					<p>Got your point...I assumed DD-Wrt uses the same stacks. My fault.</p><p>So I guess the only chance I have to get it working is adding another OpenWrt router wired to the main router, and using that as AP to distribute wireless.</p><p>I really wish IEEE would have standardized WDS <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" />.
