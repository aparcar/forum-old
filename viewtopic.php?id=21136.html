					<p>Hi all<br />I am totally new to openwrt.<br />My past experience with third party firmwares&nbsp; was with dd-wrt for my wrt54g&#039;s routers.</p><p>I did use this file &quot;openwrt-ar71xx-tl-wr841ndv3-squashfs.uni&quot;<br />and flashed a TL-wr841ND successfully via the vendor web interface.</p><p>However i have &quot;zero&quot; knowledge how to use kamikaze since its a console and i would like very much either know how to install<br />webif or LUCI to be able to flash back to vendor firmware .<br />This TP-link router does not seem to have a firmware recovery like the trendnet.<br />I can ping the router and open&nbsp; &nbsp;with putty.</p><p>Help would be greatly appreciated.<br />Btw i did use &quot;openwrt-ar71xx-tew-632brp-squashfs.uni&quot; on my TEW-632BRP&nbsp; <br />and it work quite well and have web interface LUCI which is great !!!<br />thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>I&nbsp; forgot to mention that i did try all kind of ways&nbsp; using the wiki&#039;s<br />but so far none work. Tried with under slackware, ubuntu, win xp so far&nbsp; nothing.<br />Tried TFTPD32, TFTP in all sort of ways with no success, also tried to uninstall kamikaze with<br />the wiki&#039;s procedure.... nothing work<br />How could it be possible&nbsp; to reflash with a file located on an url if the router isnt configure to reach it?<br />I am curious to know why this file is available here <br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/</a></p><p>i wonder if the person who posted this file have made any test with a wr841nd ?<br />(openwrt-ar71xx-tl-wr841ndv3-squashfs.uni)&nbsp; or simply retagged a firmware to make it flashable<br />and see.....</p><p>Plus nobody answer here which is not really helping</p>									</div>

					<p>less nouby now<br />after a lot of patience and trying all sort of tricks<br />(install LUCI and few other packages) <br />under linux convert bin file to trx then upload this firmware.trx on a web server<br />to proceed with the uninstall procedure found in the wiki<br />(cd /tmp<br />wget <a href="http://www.example.org/original.trx">http://www.example.org/original.trx</a><br />mtd -e linux -r write original.trx linux)&nbsp; and&nbsp; blabla&nbsp; <br />it never worked. <br />My conclusion: i do know its open source but the big guns are certainly not philantropic.....</p><p>Owners of tl-wr841nd or 941nd do not use theese unless you are rich and do not care to throw your money<br />away because the proposed firmwares are not immature, they are worse than that.<br />Its a shame not to WARN newcomers of the inoperability of their device if they happen to use theese<br />very very sketchy firmwares.<br />Sorry but its what i think<br />you should rename this whole thing&nbsp; either mysticwrt or guesshowwrt or tellmehowyoumadeitwork_wrt</p><p>end of my interest</p>									</div>

					<p>Woooooouuuu.....<br />Interestingly enough. But if is not present Internet through a router but nevertheless possibility to extort packages is, there is a good decision! We lift file http a server it is established it in a local mode (that in its network would be visible) and wget http://yuoulocalserverip/nameofpakeg.ipk, all is natural it in local ?????????? \tmp and then opkg instal packet name. Further all is clear))) But here wi-fi to lift to me it was not possible ((((on this model ((((</p><p>Or you can downgrade to old firmware!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>manofsan</strong> on 7 Dec 2009, 12:22)</p>

					<p>Its unfortunate that nobody could help you, nouby. But this is no reason to bash the devs. You flashed a pre-release of a _beta_ firmware onto a device that has no official support, you should not expect the full-blown OpenWRT experience.</p><p>For the record, I put together the information floating around the forum concerning the 841ND on the wiki page: <a href="http://nuwiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd">http://nuwiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd</a></p>									</div>
