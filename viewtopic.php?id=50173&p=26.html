					<p>After reading and verifying most facts and deducing some facts only said between the lines I am of the opinion that Linksys (or rather VEriK Systems) did a pretty good job on the WRT1900AC, but got mislead by one of their providers which have caused major headache for the Open Source aspect of the product.</p><p>The current progress with splitting the binary wlan driver is a major step forward, putting WRT1900AC at the same Open Source level as most Broadcom etc based router. It will allow the driver to be maintained with newer kernel releases and also fixing many of the kernel interface issues, but only to a limited extent. Very much improved situation compared to some weeks ago.</p><p>But it is not sufficient for an &quot;Open Source&quot; stamp on the product. But quite sufficient for making the product open source friendly. This combined with the other aspects of the product makes it a very promising alternative imho.</p><p>There is also some doubts on the stability of the new wlan driver, but it is unclear if that&#039;s firmware or driver issues, or simply wlan interference.</p>									</div>
