					<p>I&#039;m trying to replace the DG834Gv3 without success.</p><p>I have replaced the boot loader with a PSP one, thanks to a jtag interface. It was a locked ADAM2, without FTP access and with no SERIAL console access.<br />I&#039;m now able to do everything on this router, but i still cannot build up a running OPENWRT.</p><p>I uploaded the kernel files, the kernel decompressor launches and then i see &quot;Lanching Kernel&quot; on serial interface.<br />And then, the silent.</p><p>I&#039;m not able to view anything on serial console (9600,19200, 38400, 115200), and don&#039;t see the device at 192.168.1.1.</p><p>What can i do? I have full control on the device, but OPENWRT seems to not work. On a DG834Gv2 it worked successfully.</p><p>I can post any information that you need.</p><p>Thank you i.a.,<br />aNt1X</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>aNt1X</strong> on 24 Mar 2007, 13:52)</p>

					<p>the JTAG is the JP102 connector, near the serial JP603 connector.<br />IF you keep your ethernet connectors to the right with the adsl connector to the bottom, and the wireless chip on the top, the JTAG connector will be at top-left corner of the board, it&#039;s the 14-pin connector that you have to mount.</p>									</div>
