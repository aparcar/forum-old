					<p>*FIXED* (wish i could edit the title)</p><p>I am looking for a way to pass assigned DNS servers onto the hosts on my network.&nbsp; I have attempted to do it by going into the gui and adding the DHCP option: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>lan,6,8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4</code></pre></div><p>which in the /etc/config/dhcp file it looks like it adds:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;dhcp&#039; &#039;lan&#039;
