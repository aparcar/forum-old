					<p>All variants of Shorewall in HEAD have a missing dependency that is not selected in the netfilter.mk&nbsp; According to the Shorewall documentation, <a href="http://www.shorewall.net/shorewall_logging.html">http://www.shorewall.net/shorewall_logging.html</a>, the minimal shorewall installation depends on netfilter syslog target, which is provided by iptables-mod-extra.&nbsp; According to the same page, shorewall may alternatively use ULOG or NFLOG to satisfy its logging requirements.&nbsp; ULOG is provided by iptables-mod-ulog, but NFLOG is not currently directly selected by any default packages.&nbsp; I propose the following, provided the makefiles be capable of such a function, that the Shorewall packages depend on either iptables-mod-extra or iptables-mod-ulog, with a predisposition towards iptables-mod-extra since openwrt firmwares default to syslog capabilities.&nbsp; I could be pursuaded the other way if the combination of packages required for ulog logging resulted in a smaller disk footprint.&nbsp; I have not analyzed this aspect.</p><p>Stanley Pinchak</p>									</div>
