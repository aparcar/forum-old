					<p>Dear nbd and Florian,</p><p>almost since one year I observe the development process of kamikaze.<br />The both issues I do observe are the broadcom-2.6 and the zd1211 developments.</p><p>We all know broadcom-2.6 wireless isn&#039;t working. I do not ask, when it will be working, because you are not the main developers for that driver.<br />On the other hand, I am free to consider your zd1211 driver changes, efforts and policy as questionable.</p><p>Florian did cancel the zd1211 suppport for 2.4 with <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/3636">Changeset 3636</a> because it did not compile.<br />So I could not bring Broadcom-Wireless [2.4] (Asus WL-500gx) and zd1211 USB together.<br />I played with compile parameters and other things in zd1211, 2.4 and it did compile but with a lot of unresolved symbols when insmod.<br />I am am not firm with kernel modules and I dig and dig in forums and driver-sites but the solution is far away and I didn&#039;t find co workers.</p><p>So I focused Kernel 2.6, zd1211-r85 and one other usb-wlan-device with the aim, they do work together as a real wlan-bridge.<br />Therefor I need the zd1211 device as master (ap-mode).<br />Which driver does this task for me? zd1211-rX can work as ap, zd1211-rw not (<a href="http://www.linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers/zd1211rw#zd1211rw">linuxwireless.org</a>).</p><p>I dont wont loose so much words, easily take a look at <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/search?ticket=on&amp;changeset=on&amp;q=zd1211&amp;page=2&amp;noquickjump=1">Changeset 7433, Ticket 1806 and Changeset 7461</a>. It&#039;s self explaining.</p><p>I don&#039;t want feel as guard of zd1211 but make me please understand the withdrawel of zd1211-package/driver again with <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/9372">Changeset 9372</a>.</p><p>Yes, there are concurrent versions of a zd1211 driver and in my very humble opinion, there are good reasons for that as long as there are diffierent approaches of the driver structure.<br />Therefore please leave this concurrency or correct me if I&#039;am wrong and/or blind.</p><p>So far as you can&#039;t become broadcom-wireless on kernel 2.6 working, who want&#039;s to help me, that zd1211-r85 will work with kernel 2.4?<br />Can the compiling problems really be so big, that you move that package from that tree completely?<br />When I play with compiling and I had i little success but after all the insmod fails, I had the feeling, that I was so near to the solution. But I have not the lot of knowledge of kernel modules, compiling options and so on.<br />The only thing I can do, is reporting my efforts, collecting informations, and testing things. I am no kernel hacker.<br />In the meantime (six months ago) my son was born. Isn&#039;t that a good reason, not learning kernel hacking, but other things?</p><p>Thanks a lot and CU,<br />Sven</p>									</div>
