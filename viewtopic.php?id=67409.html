					<p>This is most likely a driver problem.&nbsp; The driver tries hard to work around a number of firmware issues, which includes some firmwares which will use the wrong mac address for the host side.&nbsp; To &quot;fix&quot; fhis, the driver replaces &quot;unexpected&quot; mac addresses with its own.&nbsp; That does not work well with bridging.....</p><p>This particular workaround should probably be disabled whenever an interface is part of a bridge.&nbsp; Maybe look at the promiscuous flag?&nbsp; Or something else?</p><p>I deeply regret ever falling for the ethernet emaulation of these devices BTW.&nbsp; It&#039;s all just smoke and mirrors to make an IP point-to-point tunnel look like an ethernet, and the number of firmware bugs related to the header manipulation is just ridiculous. It would have been much cleaner to treat the modems as the IP-only devices they are, and let you deal with setting up a half-bridge instead. And I think you are better off if you do that anyway. Don&#039;t try to bridge DHCP.&nbsp; Run a local DHCP server serving the address config you retreive from the modem instead.. And don&#039;t bridge packets.&nbsp; Route them, using the same tricks the modem uses:&nbsp; rule based routing using incoming interface to select outgoing interface.</p>									</div>

					<p>The problem with lte modems is, that you usually cannot configure them as you would like to, i doubt you can configure routing. I have lte modem in rndis mode and nothing can be configured at all, not even dmz, I can not even password protect the web interface. But the bridge worked for me. First I followed &quot;dumb ap&quot; recipe, configured lan IP in /etc/config/network from modem&#039;s range and set gateway to the ip of the usb modem, specified dns and finally made a bridge:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;lan&#039;
        option ifname &#039;eth0 eth1 usb0&#039; # &lt;-----
        option type &#039;bridge&#039;
.
.</code></pre></div><p>This worked for me fiine, I have avoided double nat and dhcp is assigned by the usb modem, but it has no adventage, because I cannot configure port forwarding or dmz (at least with the particular usb modem I have). It has really many disadventages, but one adventage it has though, it is easy to set up and connection is stable. You don&#039;t have to dial up, reconnect in case of connection drop, figure apn, user name, password, dial number, etc. On lte you don&#039;t get public IP anyway, so dmz or port forward is not needed.</p><p>How works QMI I have no experience, but if it is just another network interface, you can see its name in ifconfig and probably bridge it like I did.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 8 Sep 2016, 22:21)</p>

					<p>Thanks to bmork for pointing me in the right direction.</p><p>The RNDIS /CDC_ETHER and QMI drivers both emulate ethernet devices but are not related as far as I know.

I also configured a new firewall zone for both interfaces, allowing forwarding. Of course I didn&#039;t forget to install relayd from the repo.<br />Surprisingly this contraption worked as expected (DHCP forwarded to core Firewall) and I will post configs for people with similar needs once I get the right SMA adapter (it&#039;s a mess) and tested it in production (fallback for VOIP in my case).</p>									</div>

					<p>SMA Adapters arrived today and boy what can I say. I am nothing short of impressed by the throughput this little combo pulls.</p><p>I have been using a Huawei E3372-153s in ppp mode using a PocketPort2 (pricy..) and a Lancom 1780EW-4G (******* expensive, no bridge mode and catastrophic configuration / debug) and everything was at least 20% if not more slower than my ZTE MF831 in QMI mode and a crusty RaspberryPi 1 even though the Lancom has one of those Sierra mpcie modems. <strong>Commercial products for 4G bridging are either not existing or are a cumbersome fail.</strong> I manage to get 26 M/bits down and 20 M/bits up at my location (not seeing the tower) and the Pi is using up to 70% of it&#039;s CPU during the download test. I don&#039;t now If I could get more throuput using the Pi 2 but question is if relayd / firewall use more than one core properly(?). But I think right now I am limited by my location, phones don&#039;t even manage to get 20 down and I&#039;m happy with that.</p><p>I&#039;m moving for my bachelor thesis so I will come back to write a doc when I got that sorted out. Who is the right Person to talk to to get this published on the wiki?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>joellinn</strong> on 14 Sep 2016, 23:57)</p>
