					<p>Hello, I have a simple TP-Link TL-MR3420, i installed openWRT v1 and I trying to connect it with USB LTE-GSM modem&nbsp; Huawei E3372. <br />Unfortunately In default configuration TL-MR3420 didn&#039;t see E3372, so I found drivers for linux from forum <a href="https://unlock4modem.in/install-huawei-data-card-driver-linux-fedora-os/">https://unlock4modem.in/install-huawei- â€¦ fedora-os/</a>&nbsp; at huawei page.</p><p>Of corse it was a bug in compile time but I fix it by comment unexpected line with debug statement.</p><p>After instalation I was able to connect to internet on my ubuntu laptop, so I was thinking &quot;If I can compile it on ubuntu I will be able to install on openWRT&quot;</p><p>I simply login by SSH to TL-MR3420 and I download by SSH drivers it has something like 5MB and my TP-link has Flash: 4 MiB, so After download I got command &quot;there is no space on device&quot; so I cant unpack it or compile.</p><p>Is possible to omit this flash limitation? For example by mount external drive? (I tried with pendrive but openWRT didn&#039;t mount it correctly.</p><p>Or is any way to cross-compile and install only binary file on TL-MR3420?</p><p>I am new with openWRT so any idea will be helpfull how to solve this</p>									</div>
