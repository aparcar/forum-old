					<p>Ok, we&#039;ve got some new stuff for you guys to play with -</p><p><strong>Features:</strong><br /><strong> Â· </strong> new buildroot (much cleaner sources)<br /><strong> Â· </strong> new kernel (2.4.29 - thx wbx)<br /><strong> Â· </strong> based on the 3.37 firmware (that means v2.2 support)<br /><strong> Â· </strong> support for jffs2 only layout (vs squashfs + jffs2 overlay)<br /><strong> Â· </strong> much more ...</p><br /><p><strong>DOWNLOAD:</strong><br /><a href="http://openwrt.org/downloads/experimental/">http://openwrt.org/downloads/experimental/</a></p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong><br />The experimental stuff is just that, experimental.
