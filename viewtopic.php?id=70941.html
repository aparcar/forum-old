					<p>Folks,<br />I have a wireless device running OpenWRT Chaos Calmer 15.05 version. The wireless chipset is Atheros 9000 series. The mac80211 and cfg80211 subsystems are used internally. I was able to successfully enable and run station<br /> mode using iw, ip and wpa_supplicant commands. Background scanning was enabled by using bgscan in the wpa_supplicant.conf.</p><p>Now, I&#039;m trying the same using uci commands instead. But bgscan is not supported in UCI. I tried a hack: booted the device up, enabled station mode using UCI. Then manually edited the config file under /var/run/wpa_supplicant-&lt;dev&gt;.conf, added the line &#039;bgscan=&quot;simple:40:-75:120&quot; in the network section, then went to wpa_cli and &#039;reconfigure&#039;, which re-reads the wpa_supplicant conf file. Now background scanning works.</p><p>I&#039;m wondering if there is a better way to do this using UCI instead of this hack approach.</p>									</div>
