					<p>The Firmware Image I uploaded contains incorrect Checksum that&#039;s why you are unable to Upload the BIN file through the Web Interface of TP LINK Official Firmware.</p><p>Follow Below Listed Steps to Upgrade to OpenWRT</p><p>1. Change your Computer Ethernet Interface IP Address to &quot;192.168.0.66&quot; (its compulsary else it will not work)<br />2. Download TFTP Server on your Computer from Here <a href="http://tftpd32.jounin.net/download/Tftpd32-4.52-setup.exe">http://tftpd32.jounin.net/download/Tftp â€¦ -setup.exe</a><br />3. Download OpenWRT Firmware for WR841n v10 from here <a href="http://www.megafileupload.com/dyhP/OpenWRT-WR841v10.bin">http://www.megafileupload.com/dyhP/OpenWRT-WR841v10.bin</a><br />4. Rename the Downloaded OpenWRT Firmware Filename to &quot;wr841nv10_tp_recovery.bin&quot;<br />5. In TFTPd32 Software Set your &quot;Current Directory&quot; path to same Folder Location where you have saved &quot;wr841nv10_tp_recovery.bin&quot;<br />6. Now Plug the CAT5 Cable Connected to Your Computer to Port 1 of TP LINK WR841n v10<br />7. Now Keep Holding the &quot;WPS/Reset&quot; Button on Back of your Router and at same time Press the Switch ON Button Now wait for 10 Seconds and Release the &quot;WPS/Reset&quot; Button.<br />8. Your Router is Now being Upgraded to OpenWRT Firmware and in about a Minute when Successfully Upgraded You will see 3 Lights in your Router Power, Port 1 LED &amp; Lock LED.<br />9. Now change your Computer IP Address to &quot;192.168.1.66&quot; and You can now access the OpenWRT as Usual Open the Command Prompt on Windows and Type &quot;telnet 192.168.1.1&quot; and Now OpenWRT Screen would come up and you can execute any commands as usual and refer to the Official OpenWRT Wiki/Documentation regarding the configurations You can also access the OpenWRT Luci Web Interface at <a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a></p><p>Hope this helps, This is working perfectly I am using OpenWRT on TL-WR841n v10</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lohchab1</strong> on 18 Sep 2015, 18:15)</p>

					<p>@lohchab1,</p><p>Many thanks for compiling this version. I used the exact procedure above described and openwrt is working like a charm.

					<p>I have also observed that When OpenWRT is Installed on WR841n v10 Only Internal Antenna Seems to be Working External Antennas do not work Due to which It gives very Low Coverage/Range.</p><p>Help would be appericiated, if some developers can look into it I have simply Compiled OpenWRT Chaos Calmer built for v9 and Have Simply Changed it to v10 So, Hardware Version do not mismatch which would prevent the upgradation process from TP Link Firmware to OpenWRT everything else seems to be working perfectly in v10 Just Coverage is very low..</p><p>I have both v9 and v10 and Have observed v10 has 50% less coverage when OpenWRT is Installed on it..
