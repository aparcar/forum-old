There are certainly mismatches.</p><p>You need to pull the same revision for both of them. Either the current head 34530 or the same old 29763 for both.</p><p>If you wan an old version for packages, use direct svn up for that :<br />svn up -r VERSION ./feeds/packages</p><p>(after updating them normally first to create the svn storage)</p><p>You don&#039;t really need the &quot;make download&quot;. However, it is useful in the sense that it downloads all the sources at once. If a download fails, you haven&#039;t wasted time for the building work itself. (If you don&#039;t do that, your build may break after 44 minutes compiling work when the last package to be downloaded fails....) Downloads very rarely fail, so that is not that essential.</p><p>EDIT:<br />and you do not probably need the old version 29763. The Wiki article just specifies, in which version the support for that device has been added. Just try with the current version.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 6 Dec 2012, 14:32)</p>

					<p>Actually I too am having troubles downloading various packages during compile. I don&#039;t think that I had problems with dropbear (or at least, I didn&#039;t have them yet), but I do remember that for example asterisk wouldn&#039;t download in trunk or attitude_adjustment. That&#039;s my main reason for using make download, since this way I&#039;m able to see which packages can&#039;t be downloaded and remove them from menuconfig. Still, the progress on this front is slow and painful and there seem to be quite a few packages that have problematic addresses.</p>									</div>
