					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve a basic OpenWRT architecture question. Looking at UCI source code in C and UCI wrappers, I got the impression that UCI scripts only change the config files. Who makes the actual changes by invoking Linux shell commands or restart a daemon or whatever needs to be done to make the actual change? <br />For example, follow this X-WRT flow. Let&#039;s say we change the Start and Limit ranges on the DHCP server page (cgi-bin/webif/network-dhcp.sh). Internally, it calls uci_set &quot;dhcp&quot; &quot;$config&quot; &quot;start&quot; &quot;$start&quot;. Now uci_set will change the config file /etc/config/dhcp to change the &#039;option start&#039; and &#039;option limit&#039; lines. So far so good. But who will inform the DHCP daemon to let it know the new IP range?<br />Any pointers to docs or right place to look into code will be appreciated!</p><p>(Reposted from Kamikaze - general Discussions forum since this is probably the right forum.)</p>									</div>
