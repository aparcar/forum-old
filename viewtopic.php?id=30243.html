					<p>That worked, thanks!</p><p>I was able to flash the modified cfe and it boots fine.&nbsp; Dumping the default config shows my changes are there like boot_wait=on, however holding down the reset button during power-on doesn&#039;t load these defaults.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t seem to do anything at all as far as I can tell so not sure whats going on there..</p>									</div>

					<p>No, I had issues with it even before the change.&nbsp; I think I only ever got it to reset once.&nbsp; I tried pushing the reset and plugging in the power while still holding it, I tried pushing it once the power light starts to blink.&nbsp; Even if I push it when the dmz light comes on openwrt never enters safe mode, so I assume there&#039;s something wrong with the button on a hardware level.</p><p>Is there some command line utility that can detect the button push and tell me if its working or not?</p>									</div>
