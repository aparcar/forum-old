My guess is that in your network no server can saturate the 1Gbps speed of the switch anyway, so I assume this capability will not make any difference in your network. But then I do not know what you actually use and hence could be wrong.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>RangerZ wrote:</cite><blockquote><br /><p>Also what is the practical difference in a 4K and 8K mac address table?&nbsp; I have about 30 devices in my static list of IPs.</p></blockquote></div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With 8K you can attach twice as many downstream ethernet devices to each port than with 4k; given your 30 devices this limit does not matter at all (also putting even 4K devices in one L2 domain sure is asking for trouble, but I digress). TL;DR: no practical difference for your stated use case.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>RangerZ wrote:</cite><blockquote><br /><p>Finally, I had an issue configuring Jumbo frames in the past.&nbsp; If I recall the cards and the switches were not exactly the same size.&nbsp; If I recall I need a 9216 byte frame size, and that a switch with 9K frame size may not be adequate.</p></blockquote></div><p>So, according to google, a 9K payload will result in a ethane packet larger than 9K, depending on the required headers for the used encapsulation. If you really want to use 9K jumbo frames it seems safest to make sure the switch will allow all reasonable overheads and leads to requiring &gt;=9216 byte frame support by the switch. What encapsulation will you be using? On the other hand pMTUd should deal with different MTUs along your network path just fine.</p>									</div>

That said some routers enforce the use of VLAN tags internally, if all external connections are routed via one switch for example.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>RangerZ wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>The second is do I need what I want?</p><p>I have a PC Engines ALIX which does not have a switch or VLAN.&nbsp; It has 2 Ethernet ports which I can run separately or bridged.&nbsp; There is a third port set as WAN.</p></blockquote></div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am quite shire you could still configure and use VLANs on each interface, if you really wanted, I just doubt that you really want that <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>RangerZ wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I would like to be able to prioritize traffic for VOIP.</p></blockquote></div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Okay, both qos-scripts and sqm-scripts will do that almost out of the box by virtue of voip traffic being relatively sparse, now if you have very little bandwidth you might need to to more that just relay on fq_codel&#039;s goodness. If you have VoIP issues, please post more specific details to help diagnose those (caveat, I am not a voip expert by any means, so posting information will most likely not fix your problem <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> )<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>RangerZ wrote:</cite><blockquote><p> I also have a Silicondust Digital Cable Card Network Tuner <a href="http://www.silicondust.com/products/hdhomerun/prime/">http://www.silicondust.com/products/hdhomerun/prime/</a> .&nbsp; I am having some issues with the picture freezing and do not know if it is network or PC related as yet.</p></blockquote></div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have you tried using this with all non-essential devices turned off? If this is still freezing with no compeition it most likely can not easily be solved by using VLANs and ethernet QoS (as these basically only help with managing congestion better/differentially).</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>RangerZ wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I may also want to prioritize traffic for this, if it is network related.&nbsp; Most traffic goes through 3 switches.</p><p>I mostly have Netgear GS-108 and GS-105, but one D-Link DG-2208(which appears to be failing at the power connector)</p></blockquote></div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fo testing I would connect the Silicondust to the switch directly connected to the alix and if that works move it back to its normal position.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>RangerZ wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I guess what I was not clear on is how big a MAC address is.</p></blockquote></div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A MAC address is 48bits, but I believe most switches specify how many MACs they can learn. and not how many bits of memory they use for the cache, but even then 4000/48 = 83.3 &gt;&gt; 30...<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>RangerZ wrote:</cite><blockquote><div class="quotebox"><cite>moeller0 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>(also putting even 4K devices in one L2 domain sure is asking for trouble, but I digress).

But I am by no means an expert on optimal L2 domain sizes...<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>RangerZ wrote:</cite><blockquote><br /><div class="quotebox"><cite>moeller0 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>What encapsulation will you be using?

One of the disadvantages of jumbo frames is that they high the medium longer and hence make latency control a bit harder (then again on a &gt;= Gbit ethernet that should not really matter that much).</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>

If you are uncertain how to set up sqm scripts. richbhannover created a great how-to document under <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/sqm">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/sqm</a><br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>RangerZ wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I just did not want the switch to rule that out, so I guess I am willing to spend the extra $10 to get a switch with 802.1p even if I never actually end up using it.</p></blockquote></div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I really think that you neither want nor need ethernet qos on the switch, but if the difference really is just $10 I would probably also opt for the higher spec&#039;d gear <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>RangerZ wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I have run a cable from the same switch that the SD tuner is on directly to the PC (on the floor and up the stairs), bypassing 3 switches and some punch downs.&nbsp; I think the problems dropped by over 50%.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have all the wall jacks wired with at least 2 cat 5/6 and can, with not too much effort, move the service direct to the switch inside the wall (as opposed to the floor as it is now for test).&nbsp; I am also thinking of wiring the routers second LAN port to a switch with just the tuners and PC on it.&nbsp; Not sure if it&#039;s technical improvement or just a feel good idea.</p></blockquote></div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I think that isolating tuner and PC on the same switch without other heavy network users sounds like a very reasonable network design. Also you could then use wireshark/tcpdump on that PC to see what actually floats around the network segment that might affect your tuners outout. Heck maybe you could try to connect tuner and PC directly without any switch (or just a fully isolated switch) to see whether the freezes go away...<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>RangerZ wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I will try moving the tuner to the routers other LAN port first and benchmark the drops. </p><p>I have not tried shutting down all the other devices.&nbsp; I have a number of IoT devices, so it&#039;s challenging just to turn off things like my sprinkler.&nbsp; Just have to unplug things.&nbsp; From a more practical perspective, all the devices are idle, save background tasks, when I am watching TV.&nbsp; I kill most of the auto this and that updates, so my mail client polling every 10 is the only real traffic that I can think of.&nbsp; It&#039;s me myself and I.&nbsp; I&#039;m not fighting a hoard of streaming teenagers for bandwidth.</p></blockquote></div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A that might work as well, but if one of the devices actually misbehaves and floods the network periodically with broadcasts it can still screw up your TV experience; but what about leaving all in place and just connect tuner and PC directly (using fixed IP addresses temporarily) which will have a similar effect from removing all other devices, while being potentially more convenient to implement.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>RangerZ wrote:</cite><blockquote><br /><p>I am not clear that jumbo is worth the effort.</p></blockquote></div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor am I, but I would be amazed, if that would be the your bottleneck.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>RangerZ wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Again my issues go back to having a 10/100 LAN and trying to get it working.</p></blockquote></div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was under the impression your LAN was 1000, having 10 and 100 in the mix can explain some of the issues you see, especially if the slower machines are broadcasting I believe. It might make sense to isolate the slower devices on dedicated switches and then use a router to combine those switch uplinks again, but that might be severe over-engineering <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><br /><div class="quotebox"><cite>RangerZ wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I just clocked 687/664 Mbps read/write across my LAN to a PC 1 switch away with a RAM drive.&nbsp; Not outrageous, but not any practical bottleneck.</p></blockquote></div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I agree, not bad for an actual file-transfer. You might want to use flent&#039;s RRUL test (www.flent.org basically a nice wrapper for netperf that also creates fancy graphs) to measure your networks performance. The RRUL test might be a good idea as it will also measure the ICMP latency during network load, and machines spewing garbage into your network should also affect the ICMP traces in the RRUL test. Thinking of this, this would be a decent approach to test whether the network affects your TV streams, if you see issues in the RRUL plot you can use that to also isolate the root cause more easy. (As an anecdote, I had periodic (every 56 seconds) issues in my home network that were caused by a broken wifi-AP that wrecked havoc every 56 seconds only to become quite in between, took me a few month to notice and I only diagnosed it using the RRUL test and luck (it was pure chance that I did two tests one with the AP powered and one without back to back, so that the issue became so obvious I could not avoid noticing it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> , but I digress).<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>RangerZ wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Thanks for all your detail advice.&nbsp; I&#039;ll report back in a week or so.&nbsp; I try to run each scenario for at least 2 days to count the failures.</p><p>For reference, what are your favored switches at the moment?</p></blockquote></div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have to admit that I have no preference at all, since I only have 6 devices in my network (and only one of those wired, the rest just on wifi) I have no need for a dedicated switch (beyond the 4 ports in my router). In the past I always used the cheapest 8 port Gbit switches since I knew that my expected traffic was &lt;&lt; 1 Gbps so I assumed all switches should be able to pull this off.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am sure there are people here with better recommendations; I seem to recall that there are switches that allow to mirror all traffic on a dedicated port which might be a good idea to diagnose issues (in a switch it can get hard to snoop/dump traffic not going to the snooper as the switch tends to isolate flows, as you know, so the monitor port helps working around that)</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>
