					<p>Hi, </p><p>can some one explain the difference what exaclty disabling /etc/config/wireless radio0 section and executing wifi do. In wifi.sh there is a part to handle this situation that echo the radio0 is disabled and do &#039;set disable&#039;&nbsp; and call disable_mac80211<br />how this is different from just executing wifi down radio0 without disabling the radio section in /etc/config/wireless</p>									</div>

					<p>I had a DSA switch (one cpu port -&gt; wan/lan[1-5]) no vlans in a TP-Link 941N. I made the mistake of putting an IP address on it.</p><p>All the ethernet frames were getting scrambled and duplicated after that. Game over - no working lan port. No failsafe (because I was JFFS)</p><p>I think it&#039;s a good idea to enable wifi only on first boot (before /overlay is set up) without bridging (to the router only). No static config to keep it enabled as a good back up.</p><p>All you would need is a /etc/config/wireless file in rom and wifi start, and have it load from a uci-defaults script. It&#039;s also good to have a default wireless config file in the /rom partition as a reference.</p><p>You could use the devices mac address as a wep or psa key. Remember it&#039;s only a one boot event, and it&#039;s only loaded from a small script in rom once. That would stop people bricking their routers. Seriously EAD deamon is not worth it.</p><p>The one time login (telnet warning banner) could tell them to reboot the router once all needed settings have been applied, and execute /etc/passwd.</p><p>If someone really doesn&#039;t want to set it then they can ctrl-c out of it.</p>									</div>
