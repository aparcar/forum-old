					<p>Can the Dirty COW exploit be triggered without user access to a openwrt device? for example remotely could a virus re-write privileges to the openwrt system to gove it root access or would it first need some sort of user access to begin with trigger the vulnerability? also is there a way to apply a patch without rebuilding an image?</p><p>Thanks for any advise</p>									</div>

					<p>Its local exploit. Attacker needs to run non-privileged code. The only attack vector in default openwrt seems to be dnsmasq because its the only process running as non-root.</p>									</div>
