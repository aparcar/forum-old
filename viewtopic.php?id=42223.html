					<p>Hello,</p><p>I often need my serial console to fix stuff on my TP Link WR703N. I like my router to be in a closed case. There are howto&#039;s on that already, see 2.5 cinch mod. However I have a CP2102 based serial cable. The PCB with the chip is nice and small. I think smaller then the PL2303 PCB. This comes in handy as it gives enough space for an internal USB Hub. So I opened up the CP2102 case and made pictures of it.<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-zfYzN5W-Wno/URZJnZD56yI/AAAAAAAAAtE/Axg2_5jvFy4/s1440/DSC_0054.jpg" alt="PunBB bbcode test" /></span></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-3VuXH_Uq_yI/URZJrz-X5bI/AAAAAAAAAtI/pEWuTDNxRgw/s1440/DSC_0055.jpg" alt="PunBB bbcode test" /></span></p><p>The idea is as follows. I want to put the cp2102 inside the router enclosure and cut a hole for the usb port. This would allow me to have access to the serial console with a closed case and just a ordinary usb cable. As the serial chip has a 5V pin this could be connected to the micro USB socket. So I could deliver power to the device and have a serial console just with one cable. mveplus at <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=35682">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=35682</a> had a similar idea but with the microUSB cable.</p><p>The question is now, would I have the same issues as described in the thread above or would it work ?</p><br /><p>Another problem to solve :</p><p>The USB connector on the PCB is a male one. This needs to be replaced with a female connector.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ianmcmill</strong> on 9 Feb 2013, 15:26)</p>

					<p>As I also mentioned in the thread before, the enumeration of the usb-serial adapter will take a few seconds, so you will miss the first seconds of serial console output (and if you need to enter the bootloader, this may become very tricky). So, it may be a good idea to add a power switch.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ah okay I understand now. Did take a bit longer. Adding a power switch would be to much of grinding into the case. So I think I&#039;ll just stick with the idea of including the adapter with a male USB type a socket and let the micro USB as is.</p><p>Or would it be possible to add some circuit that delays the power from getting to the microUSB? I don&#039;t know much about electronics. Maybe a relay ? Oh wait. I have some 555 laying around <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
