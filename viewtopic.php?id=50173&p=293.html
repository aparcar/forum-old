There are a few standard swconfig commands/interfaces that will be stable from switch driver to switch driver. But you can also define commands specific to your switch/driver.

					<p>@slan<br />That has been an ongoing issue for me also. I am using a wrt1900ac v1. I understand the caching but usually wireless will drop once the memory is used does not matter if you use samba or ftp. You can flush the cache by &quot;echo 3 &gt;/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches&quot;<br />It seems like there should be a way to reserve say 10% of memory for everything else, but I have not found a way.</p>									</div>

					<p>@RickStep<br />I normally believe, live and let live, but contribute something&nbsp; useful or GTFOH! unlike you I bought my router to learn, not to have it handed to me on a platter. When you quit learning, it is time to give it up! So someone likes an old version...So what? I flashed a new ver. of the trunk build bot it would not last more 8 min. using 33.8% on core #0&nbsp; softirq and found out it is still the 10.3.0.8 replaced the mwlwifi.ko and my33.8% cpu0 went to nothing. This is to benefit all...... And to be a sheep........Let&#039;s just say I&#039;m not going there. &quot;Done feeding the troll&quot; </p><p>One question though why has the revert not taken on the trunk?</p>									</div>
