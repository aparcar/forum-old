					<p>I have a router that lacks a USB port so I am very limited. it&#039;s a Motorola WR850Gv2 and runs open-wrt very well.<br />It has two serial ports available and a couple open GPIO pins. I know that digital sound only need hi&#039;s and low&#039;s to work, is it possible to write a package that will allow mpd or similar to output sound digitally(in a decodable standard) to one of these gpio pins?<br />I welcome any advice, but i am trying to not run out and buy another router just to play around.</p><br /><p>The idea doesn&#039;t seem to unrealistic, and i would only run the signal through coax, not optical.</p><p>happy hacking,<br />phyxl</p>									</div>

					<p>You would need to send the data in bursts, and have some kind of buffering, otherwise any system activity would result in interrupted sound.&nbsp; It may be better to simply send mp3, where the decoder chip will do some buffering for you, and the data rate will be lower, see:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.pjrc.com/mp3/sta013.html">http://www.pjrc.com/mp3/sta013.html</a></p><p>OTOH, if you just want sound (not music), there is an interesting page here: <br /><a href="http://www.sunspot.co.uk/Projects/SWEEX/beeper.html">http://www.sunspot.co.uk/Projects/SWEEX/beeper.html</a></p>									</div>
