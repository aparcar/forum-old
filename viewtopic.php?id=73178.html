					<p>If the repeater AP&#039;s are running AP interfaces with the same SSID as the master AP, they need to have bssid set in the client interface to force them to connect to the right place (usually the master AP, unless you need to make a chain of hops between the repeaters).&nbsp; Otherwise the repeater APs may connect to each other in a loop, and no one in that loop will have access to the Internet since there is no connection to the master.</p><p>It works best to use your DSL modem as a bridge so it is not doing any DHCP, routing or firewalling.&nbsp; The OpenWrt router connected pppoe to the modem will handle that.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 6 Feb 2018, 16:10)</p>
