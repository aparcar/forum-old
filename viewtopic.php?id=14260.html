					<p>Hello,<br />is there any possibility to get kernel support for ebtables? I try to get it work really hard, but probably I&#039;m still missing something. I don&#039;t understand complet meaning of this changeset post:<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/9801">https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/9801</a><br />As I understand it, there is principal possibility to build kmod-ebtables from current development branch. But when i review downloaded patches after:<br />svn co <a href="https://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk/">https://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk/</a><br />then i don&#039;t see ~/trunk/target/linux/generic-2.4/patches/116-ebtables-brnf-11.patch at place. When I try to download and install patch manualy, then I get &quot;only garbage&quot; message.<br />There is no option to move on 2.6 kernel (where is native support for ebtables) for me, because I have some 18+ asus WL500gP routers with broadcom wifi and tthere is not working driver for this wifi.</p><p>Thanks for response</p>									</div>

					<p>The patch was removed because it was causing problems (neighbor table overflows), even when ebtables itself was not used.<br />If someone manages to fix those problems, we can add the patch back to trunk, but until then it needs to stay out of tree.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have been including ebtables in openwrt for some number of months now, without problems.&nbsp; Perhaps if someone can help me trigger the problem, we can work out a fix of some sort?&nbsp; Perhaps there is some kind of traffic condition that helps trigger the problem?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>netprince</strong> on 26 Jan 2008, 18:24)</p>

					<p>Hi Prince,<br />soon I&#039;ll intall some 6+ WL-500gp routers on whiterussian (kernel 2.4.30). Now I have 3 working peaces and 1 of them after 3 days up-time started to allow DHCP traffic, which should be blocked. 1 of routers is installed and working for more then one year and never leaked any DHCP message. This is priority #1 for me, so when I&#039;ll have more routers running, I&#039;ll setup some observation environment. I know nothing about c++/kernel stuff so I&#039;ll ask you for some advice how to track problem (should I use strace/ltrace or something different for debug)?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi zedd,</p><p>I&#039;m not familiar with the kernel debug stuff either.&nbsp; </p><p>Perhaps you can look into using iptables to block dhcp packets?&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure you can enable iptables in a filtered bridge by setting a flag somewhere in /proc.&nbsp; </p><p>I dont use ebtables very often, but I do leave it compiled into all my firmwares.&nbsp; I was hoping to hash out the neighbor table overflows, but I forget who specifically was having the issue...</p>									</div>
