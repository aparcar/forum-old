					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve got kamikaze installed on a wrt54gl v1.1 (broadcom chipset) and am wondering if it is at all possible to do a scan and detect clients that are not associated? Essentially, I am looking to scan all channels and display rssi for all stations whether or nor they are associated with the AP performing the scan.</p><p>thanks<br />dave</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>daverod</strong> on 10 Aug 2007, 23:21)</p>

					<p>You should first be in &quot;monitor&quot; mode with the wifi adapter... The way to get there is diferent from Atheros chipset (try iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor ?). Then, you see all the packets on air, on a specific channel. The problem is how to read their level of RF (rssi) .</p>									</div>

					<p>I am trying to do this with an Atheros chipset -- how can this be accomplished?&nbsp; I have set the wifi adapter to &quot;monitor&quot; mode, but I don&#039;t know how to actually see the signal strrengths of anything beyond that.&nbsp; </p><p>I have tried to use iwlist ath0 scanning last, but this only shows a fraction of the available APs (compared to my laptop scan).</p><p>I&#039;ve also put the AP into sta mode and done a scan, and this returns a list of AP&#039;s, but it does not show anything else. </p><p>I want to see, as dave does, all objects emitting RF, be it AP or client.&nbsp; The sta mode scan doesn&#039;t show me my laptop, which would be in an ideal scan. </p><p>Any ideas?</p>									</div>

					<p>to scan APs and stations at the same time use airodump from aircrack package. Wlan interface should be in monitor mode.</p>									</div>
