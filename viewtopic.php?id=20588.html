					<p>Apologies in advance.&nbsp; I&#039;m a newbie to this.</p><p>I belong to a small community based WISP in Santa Fe, NM.&nbsp; We are currently evaluating Ubiquity Nanostation2 boxes as replacements for our current APs.&nbsp; We tried using them with the native firmware (AirOS 3.4), but we&#039;ve noticed that it is spewing certain packets which are hosing our gateway router.&nbsp; For that reason I&#039;m evaluating several other firmware loads.&nbsp; I was able to flash the latest Kamikaze on to the box and get it configured, but what is missing is any way to monitor the box using SNMP.</p><p>How does one get SNMP working in Kamikaze?</p><p>Thanks in advance for you help...</p>									</div>
