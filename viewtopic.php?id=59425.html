					<p>Hi everyone, cord cutters with 2 small children so losing wifi tv is bad news.&nbsp; Here is what we are running</p><p>tp-link tl-wr841n v9.3 it started <br />running openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr841n-v9-squashfs-factory.bin<br />all default settings except turning on Encryption: WPA2 PSK (CCMP)</p><p>Everything started 2 weeks ago, our amazon fire tablet kept not connecting to the mfgr firmware and we were rebooting both systems constantly.&nbsp; I upgrade the router firmware to the newest version of the mfgr and that made so every wireless device would stop connecting.&nbsp; Tried their helpdesk with little to no help.&nbsp; Devices that won&#039;t connect include&nbsp; Amazon firestick, amazon fireHD, iphone, android phone, sharp TV.&nbsp; Windows 8 laptops still connect without hesitation.</p><p>Read about openwrt today and decided to give it a shot.&nbsp; Everything in the firmware upgrade went smooth as silk. Same problems are persisting.&nbsp; </p><p>Its got to be hardware failure, right?&nbsp; Tried all types of security, open included.</p><p>Wireless devices see the network, it validates the password (if I enter a bad password it complains), but then it never pulls an IP address and actually connects. The router sees the device trying to connect, data is coming from the phone to the router, but nothing is returned.</p><p>All router settings are defaults still.&nbsp; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SSID &nbsp; &nbsp; MAC-Address &nbsp; &nbsp; IPv4-Address &nbsp; &nbsp; Signal &nbsp; &nbsp; Noise &nbsp; &nbsp; RX Rate &nbsp; &nbsp; TX Rate<br />[Signal: -39 dBm / Noise: -95 dBm] &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenWrt&nbsp; &nbsp; XX:XX:F3:20:6E:74&nbsp; &nbsp; 192.168.1.160&nbsp; &nbsp; -39 dBm&nbsp; &nbsp; -95 dBm&nbsp; &nbsp; 24.0 Mbit/s, MCS 0, 20MHz&nbsp; &nbsp; 72.2 Mbit/s, MCS 7, 20MHz<br />[Signal: -24 dBm / Noise: -95 dBm] &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenWrt&nbsp; &nbsp; XX:XX:36:9F:0D:C0&nbsp; &nbsp; 192.168.1.164&nbsp; &nbsp; -24 dBm&nbsp; &nbsp; -95 dBm&nbsp; &nbsp; 144.4 Mbit/s, MCS 15, 20MHz&nbsp; &nbsp; 144.4 Mbit/s, MCS 15, 20MHz</p><br /><p>Thanks for looking,</p>									</div>
