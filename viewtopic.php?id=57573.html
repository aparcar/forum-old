					<p>On my 2 routers, D-Link DIR-825 rev. C1 and D-Link DIR-835 rev. A1.&nbsp; I can only get HT40 to work on the channels 153 and 161.&nbsp; I believe it works on the lower channels as well, but their transmit power is lower so I&#039;d rather not use them.&nbsp; 153 is free, so that works well.&nbsp; 161 on the other hand is occupied by a few other networks.</p><p>149 - Sets the channel as 153<br />153 - Works as expected<br />157 - Sets the channel as 161<br />161 - Works as expected<br />165 - Doesn&#039;t work at all</p><p>If I set HT mode to HT20 I can choose the channels above and they are set as expected.&nbsp; If I use the Force HT mode checkbox then 149-161 work as expected, 165 however still doesn&#039;t work at all.</p><p>Is this expected behavior or am I missing something?</p>									</div>

					<p>AFAIK: HT40 uses two channels at the same time, so HT40+ at channel 165 needs a channel higher than 165, and that is not possible; try using HT40-, or a lower channel.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you manually configure you can specify + or -, don&#039;t know about the GUI.&nbsp; Realize that HT40- on 165 would put the secondary signals on 161, which the neighbors are using, so you don&#039;t want that in your situation anyway.</p>									</div>

					<p>The web interface only does HT40 now, doesn&#039;t do + or - any longer.&nbsp; I tried manually adding the + and - to the config then rerunning &#039;wifi&#039;, results seemed to match what I was seeing through the web interface.&nbsp; I&#039;ll double check on this.</p>									</div>
