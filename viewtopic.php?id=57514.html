					<p>I am trying to set up a separate VLAN for a guest network (with a TL-WR841N as a second AP). Now on my WNDR3700 (which has a Realtek switch) the CPU is tagged by default, but on these TP-Link devices, it&#039;s not.</p><p>Default config on the TL-WR1043ND v2 (<strong>15.05 RC1</strong>):</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config switch
    option name &#039;switch0&#039;
    option reset &#039;1&#039;
    option enable_vlan &#039;1&#039;
    option mirror_source_port &#039;0&#039;
    option mirror_monitor_port &#039;0&#039;

config switch_vlan                    
        option device &#039;switch0&#039;       
        option vlan &#039;1&#039;               
        option ports &#039;0 1 2 3 4&#039;  

config switch_vlan                    
        option device &#039;switch0&#039;       
        option vlan &#039;2&#039;               
        option ports &#039;5 6&#039;           </code></pre></div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>Since the CPU needs to be in every VLAN afaik, and a port in more than one VLAN should be tagged, this is what should be working:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config switch_vlan                    
        option device &#039;switch0&#039;       
        option vlan &#039;1&#039;               
        option ports &#039;0t 1 2 3 4t&#039;  
                                                                
config switch_vlan

       option vlan &#039;2&#039;          
       option ports &#039;0t 4t&#039;  

config switch_vlan                    
        option device &#039;switch0&#039;       
        option vlan &#039;3&#039;               
        option ports &#039;5 6&#039;         </code></pre></div><p>As soon as I apply this, I cannot connect to the router anymore over the LAN (no ping, no nothing). Wireless still works though.</p><p>On the TL-WR841N, I have a similar problem. It seems they use the same (or a similar) switch, the AR8327N, however, the WR841N is running <strong>14.07</strong>. The default VLAN looks identical:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config switch_vlan
    option device &#039;switch0&#039;
    option vlan &#039;1&#039;
    option ports &#039;0 1 2 3 4&#039;</code></pre></div><p>After adding an extra VLAN (and tagging the CPU and the shared port in both VLANs), LAN connectivity disappears. I cannot reach the device anymore except for the port part of the additional VLAN. All the other ports stop responding. Wireless seems to work (the TL-WR841N has no DHCP-server anymore and I didn&#039;t try with a static IP over wireless).</p><p>Likewise, when one (or both) the devices have an extra VLAN defined, I cannot ping from one to the other. I have tried restarting the network (/etc/init.d/network restart) or powercycling multiple times to test (you know how Einstein said only a fool tries something more than once expecting a different result...).</p><p>Would be very grateful if anyone knows how to fix this.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Borromini</strong> on 23 May 2015, 18:36)</p>

					<p>I believe that the issue is caused by the fact that you tagged the cpu port ( port 0 ) without change the br-lan config.<br />The br-lan by default is bridged to eth1 and now needed to be bridged to eth1.1 . Without this the traffic incomming from lan is always tagged by port 0 and goes nowhere.</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zhadoom</strong> on 25 May 2015, 00:28)</p>

					<p>Thanks, that makes sense, seeing as the WNDR3700&#039;s LAN is on eth0.1 and the CPU is already tagged in that case.</p>									</div>
