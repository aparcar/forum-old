					<p>I&#039;ve been using a 1043ND and an 8816 modem for over a year.</p><p>The modem needs to use PPPoA to connect to your ISP.<br />The router needs to connect PPPoE to connect to the modem (PPP over ethernet, and you&#039;re connecting them via ethernet, right?) so forget PPPoA on the router, you can even uninstall the module.</p><p>The PPPoE settings in OpenWRT allow you to enter the user/pass and it will send those over to the modem.</p><p>ONE MORE THING. Looks like you&#039;re using Sky via BT&#039;s wholesale since its ADSL and not cable? I&#039;m with IDnet, who also use BT wholesale lines around here, but the week before last I had connection problem just like yours, &#039;no device found&#039;. This despite the fact it&#039;d been working fine for over a year and I&#039;d changed nothing <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>After two days of trying to find out what the hell was wrong and talking to IDnet tech support (who were no real help), I saw a tip on another forum to try sing LLC encapsulation instead of VC-mux. It worked! So simple.</p><p>So despite the fact that my ISP says use VC-mux, and everything you read says use VC-mux, only LLC encapsulation works.</p><p>Personally I think BT are screwing around in the exchange and haven&#039;t told anyone...</p>									</div>
