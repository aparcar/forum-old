					<p>Absolutely, the same could be said about my builds. The difference being my reputation as a contributor on this community for years, and the fact that my build is built and hosted on a server belonging to the OpenWrt project. Of course, even if I was honest someone could have hacked the server and injected something. You can get around the risk by downloading my diffs, optionally inspecting them and then build yourself.</p><p>This guy on the other hand has contributed nothing, and has a seemingly intense wish to host my builds. When I refused he did it anyways, adding nothing apparently. That in itself is cause for concern. Why so anxious to host something he did not make himself on his servers?</p><p>I&#039;ve reported this to the mods, and the response I got is that this guy is a notorius troll around here for years with several registered users.</p><p>Anyways, I&#039;ve said my piece and will ignore this guy from now on.

For me, my preference is always to take a hard road to build my own firmware from scratch (including the toolchains).

					<p>I don&#039;t see the purpose of completely ripping off Arokh&#039;s build (and adding the possibility of malware and backdoors) and hosting it on another website. I had thought about rehosting these builds while back, but it isn&#039;t really necessary.</p>									</div>

					<p>TBH, I don&#039;t think anyone here has ever downloaded from the site, but the OP is free to prove me wrong. That said, given some times, I believe eventually the OP will get tired and will decide to abandon the project as well as updates new releases here.</p>									</div>
