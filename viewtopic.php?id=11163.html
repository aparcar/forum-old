					<p>I want to know more detailed about repeaters. Example: I have an AP and 100m away a repeater. How does it now work? Does the repeater repeat every signal he gets, simply stupid? When a client is connected to the AP, but the repeater cannot see him, so he wont repeat anything, right? This means, only if the client is in the area where the repeater can see him, the speed is half? If the Client is in the area where the repeater and the AP can see him, the signal will everytime be repeated, although it is not needed?<br />So it is a better idea to use repeaters with two wlan interfaces (different channels)?</p>									</div>

					<p>It works like any regenerative repeater does. A signal is received and decoded. Assuming it was received correctly a duplicate is transmitted.&nbsp; Back in the early days of 10Base2 hubs the word &quot;repeater&quot; was often used to describe their role.</p><p>Yes.<br />Right.<br />No.<br />Yes.<br />No.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Clear now?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 13 Jun 2007, 11:56)</p>

					<p>Have you already done your homework and read up on these topics?&nbsp; No offence, but you get better results if you have specific questions and show you have already done some study and serious thinking on the problem. See here:</p><p><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html</a></p><p>Your question makes no sense. A client associates with a single Access Point. Whichever one it associates with, will the one that replies.&nbsp; If it associates with the WDS &quot;repeater&quot; node, that AP will be responsible for backhaul to it&#039;s partner which will imply repeating the packets.&nbsp; If it associates with the &quot;master&quot; AP unit, then there would be no need for it to repeat anything on WiFi, it will be doing that via the bridge to the wire.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 13 Jun 2007, 18:53)</p>
