					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I just installed OpenWrt experimental few weeks ago after having had a nice discussion at the LinuxTag booth.<br />This is a WRT54GS-DE (FCC: Q87-WRT54GV2) which used to have its original firmware v2.07.2.de.</p><p>What I noticed after experimental installation was that I couldn&#039;t get ppp working.<br />This happened because /etc/init.d/S50pppoe expected IFNAME=$(nvram get pppoe_ifname), yet the pppoe_ifname setting was UNSET by my original and never updated firmware!!<br />I&#039;d thus guess that /etc/nvram.overrides is somehow incomplete for the status left behind by my particular vendor firmware version (please fix!).<br />I then configured pppoe_ifname NVRAM setting to vlan1 and I was finally (after almost an hour of confusion) able to get back my internet.</p><p>I&#039;m having additional confusion over ppp0 vs. vlan1 usage, BTW (e.g. in the case of traffic shaping; specifying vlan1 does NOT work properly there...).<br />I fortunately caught a NVRAM variable list right before firmware update (available on request; the list is far too big to post here), so I still know what the old settings list was and can think of whether ppp0 or vlan1 should have been used for a particular purpose.</p><p>And a second suggestion: for the squashfs + jffs2 firmware image, why not put all *pre-installed* ipkg packages on hold flag?<br />That way people will only automatically upgrade their newly installed (and space-eating) packages, not the ROM packages that would take a LOT more space when &quot;installed anew&quot;.</p><p>Thanks a lot for some very cool stuff!</p>									</div>
