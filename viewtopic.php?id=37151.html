Reinstalled packages and now after some attempt I can&#039;t use commands to update manually or check state of ipupdate (those ones on the guide) because I receive this message :&nbsp; line 12 : can&#039;t open /lib/functions/network.sh</p><p>Tried to reboot but nothing!<br />Do you have a solutions please? Don&#039;t want to start over again with firmware installation <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />Thank you!</p><p>EDIT: The file doesn&#039;t exists!!!!!!
