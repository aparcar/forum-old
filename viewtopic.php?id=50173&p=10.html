If the ubifs partition is reformatted when switching to the new firmware (seems about 1 out of 4 times I switch) I simply mount the USB drive manually and extract the tar and reboot.

But I&#039;ve only been able to trigger one disconnect so far... I&#039;ve transferred 16GB from client to WRT1900AC (attached USB drive) and tested client to client... from 5GHz to ether, from 2.4GHz to ether, from 5 to 2.4, from 2.4 to 5-- only failure thus far is 2.4GHz on client... which matches my testing a week ago.. I could not get 5Ghz to fail under volume, only 2.4. BUT 5Ghz would fail randomly later-- with little or no volume. And in those cases it seemed to be memory related-- a couple of memory errors on the WRT1900AC. But I wasn&#039;t watching memory during the time, just noticed in dmesg.</p><p>Looks like I&#039;ll be using this as my default router today and see what happens.</p><p>Edit: Just got 5Ghz to fail-- 5GB to USB drive on WRT1900AC... 4.49 of 4.59 transferred <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> No memory issue I can see.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jklap</strong> on 21 May 2014, 19:00)</p>
