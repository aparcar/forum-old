					<p>your last paragraph tells the whole story - you need to configure the internet connection (WAN) on your router properly. Since Luci is not up and running, you need to do this through the command line. If you have another router, my suggestion is to again reset to defaults on the WDR3500, then connect the WAN port of the WDR3500 via ethernet to the LAN side of a working router with functional internet connection. Make sure you can ping a known working server (e.g. google.com) to verify that your internet connection is working before trying to install Luci. Then follow the instructions you already tried. Once you get Luci working, please install a version that has Luci built-in so you won&#039;t have to go through this again if you ever reset to defaults. 14.07-rc3 and the pending 14.07 both qualify as such.</p><p>If you can&#039;t get your internet connection working and therefore can&#039;t install Luci, I suggest downloading 14.07-rc3 (or 14.07 final, which should be out any day now) to our PC, then use WinSCP or similar to transfer the firmware flash to your router. Then flash that via command line (see the wiki) and you&#039;ll have a fully functioning router. WinSCP requires SSH to be enabled.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drawz</strong> on 1 Oct 2014, 05:27)</p>

Firstly, a telephone wire does in my ADSL Router which connections to the Internet automatically, then a LAN wire comes out from the ADSL Router to a Wireless Router through which I am connected to the internet. So now what I need to do is, connect a wire to the LAN port of the Wireless Router and the other end to the WAN Port of my WDR3500 Router and then connect WDR3500 to my laptop and try the same commands after resetting my router. Please let me know if this is what I need to try and if you have any questions.</p><p>I also wanted to understand, I already installed Barrier Breaker (14.07-rc3) from the link <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07-rc3/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wdr3500-v1-squashfs-factory.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_br … actory.bin</a> located on site <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr3500.">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr3500.</a> I have installed factory and not sysupgrade. Please let me know if this is wrong. Isn&#039;t this the latest version available?</p><p>Apologies for my bad english.</p><p>Thank you so much!!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hooray! Glad it worked. </p><p>You can revert to stock through Luci *IF* if you have a firmware file that does not have a bootloader included by default. Not sure what TP-Link offers for this model. There may also be users on this forum that have already removed the bootloader from the stock firmware. You can of course follow the wiki instructions carefully to trim and flash the stock firmware file yourself from the command line. </p><p>To be honest, unless you have a strong reason to go back to stock, OpenWrt is much more stable and feature-filled. It is a little more advanced/complicated, but not that hard to learn for the most important things.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drawz</strong> on 2 Oct 2014, 01:51)</p>

					<p>Just installed barrier breaker on brand new tl-wdr3500 via firmware upgrade page with no difficulty. So, not sure the statement </p><p>&quot;Tplink&#039;s newest firmware does a validation check and doesnt allow you to install 3rd party firmware.&quot;</p><p>is correct. Unless f/w on my new router is not the newest. Here&#039;s what the stock firmware reported:<br />Firmware Version: 3.14.3 Build 150518 Rel.73041n<br />Hardware Version: WDR3500 v1 00000000</p><p>What is the firmware version that does the validation check?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>suncup-jd</strong> on 21 Jan 2016, 03:02)</p>
