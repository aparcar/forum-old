					<p>Hello guys, new here <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I&#039;ve tried to look for a solution to my issue but without any success.</p><p>I&#039;ve a no name/unbranded Wifi Extender, I bought on a local store but saw that it&#039;s pretty common on internet and on chinese marketplaces, here a photo: images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31FsafBJmLL._SX355_.jpg</p><p>I&#039;ve also this one: i.ytimg.com/vi/200TktoSxoI/maxresdefault.jpg</p><p>They have the same web page as configurator: youtube.com/watch?v=DTgZlNg3uNA</p><p>Why I&#039;ve to install OpenWRT on it? I&#039;ve a WPA2 Enterprise that should be extended. It needs username/password to login and this extender only allow to use the password.</p><p>After looking around the web I found out - on an Italian website - that with OpenWRT I can &quot;upgrade&quot; my extender to use the WPA2 Enterprise (using TP-Link or other well know brands). But I don&#039;t know if my extender is capable to do it.</p><p>The extender&#039;s homepage have something that allow me to upgrade the firmware so I believe that I should be able to install a kind of custom firmare into and be able to login to this WiFi, isn&#039;t?</p><p>So to sum up:<br />- I&#039;ve this cheap wifi extender<br />- I can upload custom firmware - or at least I can upgrade the firmware<br />- I&#039;ve a WPA2 Enterprise</p><p>Is something easy to do or it&#039;s better to find a new wifi extender?</p><p>Thank you so much!</p>									</div>
