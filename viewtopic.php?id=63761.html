					<p>Hi.</p><p>I&#039;m trying to setup a (new) network at the office. In average, there are around 10-15 devices connected, but the router should be able to handle 30-40 in the worst scenario. Network traffic consists mostly of regular web surfing (viewing online documents, use of communications platforms like slack, etc.) and video conferences with people from other countries. My idea so far is to use TP Link Archer C9, but I&#039;m not sure if its cpu will be able to handle that amount of devices connected.</p><p>Which router(s) (openwrt supported) would you recommend for this scenario?</p><br /><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>I think such a use-case is out of the scope of a consumer-grade OpenWrt machine. Not because of the robustness of the system, but because of the hardware specs you can get with a SOHO router.

Zyxel&#039;s USG/UAG line comes to mind, but there are certainly others. The price of those can be daunting at first, but consider even a short downtime of half an hour for 15 people and the resulting loss of billable hours.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 29 Mar 2016, 03:03)</p>

					<p>I have machines with 20 to 100 devices over openwrt. You need a better hardware, I recommend use Ubiquiti AP LR for example. With one or two of this you can easily handle your requirements.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>metai wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I think such a use-case is out of the scope of a consumer-grade OpenWrt machine.
