					<p>Hi Guys,</p><p>currently im running ddclient on my debian machine which is updating all my DNS-Hostnames because with DD-WRT on my Router it was very untrustworthy - sometimes it was working and sometimes it wasn&#039;t working!</p><p>Now, i have OpenWRT on all of my 1043ND so i&#039;ve decided to use now the DDNS from OpenWRT.</p><p>The Problem is now that i have no forced reconnect of my ISP and i have a &quot;pseudo&quot; static ip - this means, if i reconnect to my isp the ip is in 90% of all attempts the same.</p><p>With my old ISP it was no problem, every 12 hours i got a reconnect and a new ip - this is important for DynDNS, because within 30 days of inactivity the hosts expired AND the host will be banned too if im tryining to update the host too often with the same ip.</p><p>normaly, the ddns-script is self-explaining ... i have the luci-app installed, too.</p><p>But i have a Question about the Check Interval and the Force Update.</p><p>1.) As an Example - I let check my OpenWRT Router every Min. for a new IP. If the IP is the same, NO action (or update) will be send to dyndns (otherwise, my account gets banned due to flooding) ?<br />2:) Whats About the Force Update? this will send an update to dyndns, even if my IP is still the same ? if this is right, my account will be banned, too in case of update flooding with same ip. Is It possible, to deactive the force update?</p><p>So, what can i do ?<br />The only chance i have is to force an ip-change (with an wan-port mac change) every 1-2 weeks. so should i deactivate the force update or set it to - maybe - 720h (30 days) ?</p><br /><p>Any Help is well appreciated <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>I used to use ddns-scripts to keep a legacy dyndns account alive, the default settings worked fine for me without any flooding. I too had a cable isp connection with an IP that never changes.</p><p>The check interval will just check and compare the current wan ip at the given interval but do not trigger an update if the IP didn&#039;t change. The force update will send an update even if the address didn&#039;t change. It should be fine to set that to 15 days or something.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, i will try that in this way <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>hopefully no of my hostnames will be banned <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p><p>...updating is working already, force an ip change and the new ip was delivered to dyndns in the same minute. i hope it&#039;s reliably, too - but @ OpenWRT i&#039;ll not bother about that <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p>									</div>
