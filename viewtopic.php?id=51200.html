					<p>Hello,<br />I&#039;m new to OpenWRT and was wondering if there needs to be explicit support in OpenWRT for a particular wifi device, for it to work.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;m using a CSR WF111 Wifi driver in the kernel, and can use &quot;iwlist wlan0 scanning&quot; to correctly scan for wireless networks, but I can&#039;t get it to appear as an access point or scan for networks when using the LuCI web interface.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Will.</p>									</div>

					<p>I couldn&#039;t find this chip by some quick searching. What driver/kernel module does it use? From the docs it seems UCI (and thus LuCI) only supports mac80211 compliant drivers, in addition to Madwifi (old Atheros chips) and Broadcom proprietary driver. Also, what OpenWrt version are you running? (Trunk/AA, revision?)</p>									</div>

UCI configures the driver, and it seems you will need to modify UCI in order to support the specifics of the csr_wifi driver and its userland applications, as it is not a mac80211 compliant driver. I can&#039;t provide extensive advice, but I suppose you could look at UCIs Broadcom specifics, as it is the same situation (driver with its own application (wlc/wl) to control it).</p>									</div>

					<p>While it may still be present in the backports snapshot currently used by OpenWrt, the csr wireless drivers have been removed from the linux kernel again with the following <a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=ade7615de0643a9da628688e661e08148cd7c463">commit message</a>:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>commit ade7615de0643a9da628688e661e08148cd7c463
Date:   Tue Jul 16 22:37:09 2013 -0700

    staging: csr: remove driver
    
    This driver is not being updated as the specifications are not able to
    be gotten from CSR or anyone else.  Without those, getting this driver
    into proper mergable shape is going to be impossible.  So remove the
    driver from the tree.
    
    If the specifications ever become available, this patch can be reverted
    and the driver fixed up properly.</code></pre></div><p>Accordingly it&#039;s very likely to disappear from OpenWrt very soon as well, which makes it pretty much a dead end. Preceeding discussions leading to the actual removal also implied that the driver apparently couldn&#039;t be configured without (unavailable) proprietary means.</p>									</div>
