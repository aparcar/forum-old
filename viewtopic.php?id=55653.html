					<p>It seems that I have an issue with NTP<br />I recently upgraded a TL-WDR1043ND v1.8 to Barrier Breaker (14.07) however it seems that sysntpd daemon is not running, I have tried to enable it manually using <br />#&nbsp; /etc/init.d/sysntpd start <br />But there is no trace of any ntp process (using ps) or any pid file. </p><p>These are my entries for the timeserver config:<br />config timeserver<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option enable_server &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; list server &#039;cronos.cenam.mx&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; list server &#039;0.north-america.pool.ntp.org&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; list server &#039;1.north-america.pool.ntp.org&#039;</p><p>Regards and thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>Just in case... I just found out that my config is wrong...<br /> I updated the /etc/config/system file entries like this</p><p>config timeserver &#039;ntp&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option enabled &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option enable_server &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; list server &#039;cronos.cenam.mx&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; list server &#039;0.north-america.pool.ntp.org&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; list server &#039;1.north-america.pool.ntp.org&#039;</p><p>I reviewed <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/system">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/system</a> and then I noticed I was lacking &#039;ntp&#039; after config timeserver... This worked and seems to work jsut fine with the WebUI. However it is odd that the WebUI also worked without the &#039;ntp&#039; parameter (May be it is a bug in the WebUI??)</p><p>Anyhow this worked like a charm <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>As a remark, I upgraded from 10.03 and the config was the one left after the upgrade, so it may be an upgrade issue...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gilb_4</strong> on 26 Feb 2015, 09:08)</p>
