Sometimes things don&#039;t always work so well on the actual hardware. I haven&#039;t played around with that Asus router, but from what I&#039;ve read it&#039;s a stellar box. I would be very surprised if it didn&#039;t work on the router itself.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey an update to my project--<br />I have the ASUS WL premium v2 router <br />I install openwrt version recommend in the Devices WIKI.However the router does not detect the usb modem.In the wiki again it lists the packages to be installed in order to detect a USB device.However i do not have an internet connection directly .Can I direct the http traffic on the router to my pc which uses the usb modem? So that all web traffic can pass through the pc so I can install the packages and then proceed to set up the usb modem on the router.</p><p>I guess what I am trying to say is how to set the default gateway on the router as my pc (aka IP addr) which has a connection to the internet (via USB modem -brand mentioned in previous posts)</p><p>thanks for help.</p>									</div>

					<p>It would be better to compile your own firmware image from the SVN sources. This way, if you wanted to reset to defaults, the modules would still be on the router.</p>									</div>
