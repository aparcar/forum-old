					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have recently moved over to O2 in UK and have been handed a crappy TG587n v2 router by O2. My nice Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH (openwrt trunk) is biting dust at the moment. Has anybody tried converting the router into a dumb modem.</p><p>Also, does anybody know settings would be required in openwrt to connect to O2?</p><p>Cheers</p>									</div>
