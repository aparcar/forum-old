					<p>Hi,</p><p>After a first misplaced topic, here is my question again!</p><p>I have searched for some time now and since I cannot find anything on it, I try the topic here!</p><p>Context is the following : at work, there is a very annoying proxy that keeps me from accessing some sites (yes, porn among those but I actually do not attempt to access them from work <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> ) including FTP and some I could use accessing.<br />So, I tested a SSH tunnel to a friend&#039;s machine running a SSH server (under Cygwin) and, using his connection at home, I can access everything using PuTTY.</p><p>Problem is, for this to work it needs my friend&#039;s PC running and I use his connection.<br />So, I bought an integrated controller card at Omnima that can run OpenWRT, and I intend to use this device to connect from work and use my own connection.</p><p>I made OpenWRT run on the board using the Squidge distribution and I installed what was required for OpenSSH to work, Zlib and OpenSSL library, then OpenSSH-server and OpenSSH-client.</p><p>Then, I ran ssh-keygen, and it went well.<br />But when I try &quot;ssh localhost&quot; :<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/# ssh localhost
ssh: connect to host localhost port 22: Connection refused
root@OpenWrt:/#</code></pre></div><p>And I do know what to do next. I guess I have to add users but I could not find any tutorial about this simple task, and I could not find any topic on this forum about that.</p><p>Could anyone help me?</p><p>By the way, I entered the commands using HyperTerminalon RS232 link, so the network part is detached from the command prompt.</p><p>And the command &quot;netstat -l&quot; gives me the following :</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/# netstat -l
Active Internet connections (only servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State

					<p>Usually, you would use dropbear to enable ssh on your board. If dropbear is not currently installed, look for it in&nbsp; /www/squidge/packages. Once installed, you set the root password. This will enable SSH, but it will also disable telnet.</p>									</div>

					<p>It looks like those files are being provided by openssh and not dropbear. Openssh might work, but I&#039;ve never tried it. You probably will need to do something like &#039;/etc/init.d/sshd enable&#039; to make sure openssh starts on boot. To change the root password use &#039;passwd&#039;.</p>									</div>
