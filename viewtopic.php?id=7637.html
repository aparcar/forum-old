					<p>Hello again,</p><p>after making some progress with kamikaze on the WL-HDD, I&#039;ve hit a roadblock again. I have most of the hardware up and running, except the USB controller.</p><p>The problem is quite simple: the ohci_hcd driver and the serial driver both claim IRQ 2.<br />When both are compiled into the kernel, this causes a kernel panic, when ohci_hcd is a module, it just refuses to load.</p><p>I first thought simply disabling the serial driver would take care of that, however, the code in arch/mips/bcm947xx/ fails to compile if the serial driver is disabled or a module. Besides, when using development kernels, the serial console is highly useful (and that doesn&#039;t work without the serial driver compiled right into the kernel).</p><p>So now, to make the USB controller work, it&#039;s necessary to either give the USB controller another IRQ via the PCI interrupt mapping, or to change the serial driver&#039;s IRQ (which may be more complicated, as it&#039;s already initialized in arch/mips/bcm947xx/setup.c). What&#039;s the easier way?</p><p>Florian</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi!</p><p>I think the easiest way is to &quot;fix&quot; the bcm47xx_fixup_device which get called when some device is initialized by the coresponding driver. This device_fix takes care of assigning proper resoruces or any other &quot;tweak&quot; neccessary.<br />This function is located in arch/mips/bcm947xx/pci.c</p><p>Or, if you just go through setup.c and pci.c you&#039;ll see where the PCI IRQ&#039;s gets assigned to external device etc... besides, you can always &quot;fix&quot; the irq assignment of the serial driver as SHARED. That couls also do the trick.</p><p>Regards,<br />M.Culibrk</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your tips - they worked up to a certain point. I changed bcm47xx_fixup_device to change the IRQ from 2 to 5 (the only other device using IRQ 5 is the internal HomePNA adapter and as it&#039;s disabled, that seemed like a good choice). The ohci_hcd module now loads, unfortunately, it still doesn&#039;t work. Here&#039;s the relevant dmesg output:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>&lt;7&gt;ohci_hcd: 2005 April 22 USB 1.1 &#039;Open&#039; Host Controller (OHCI) Driver (PCI)
&lt;4&gt;PCI: Enabling device 0000:00:04.0 (0000 -&gt; 0002)
&lt;4&gt;PCI: ugly USB controller hack, changing irq 2 to 5..
&lt;7&gt;PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:00:04.0 to 64

&lt;6&gt;hub 1-0:1.0: USB hub found
&lt;6&gt;hub 1-0:1.0: 2 ports detected

&lt;- At that point, I plugged in a USB Bluetooth stick:

&lt;6&gt;usb 1-1: new full speed USB device using ohci_hcd and address 2
&lt;3&gt;irq 2: nobody cared (try booting with the &quot;irqpoll&quot; option)

&lt;3&gt;handlers:

&lt;0&gt;Disabling IRQ #2
&lt;4&gt;ohci_hcd 0000:00:04.0: Unlink after no-IRQ?  Controller is probably using the wrong IRQ.</code></pre></div><p>After that, the serial console (which <strong>did</strong> use IRQ 2) was dead.<br />So some part of the kernel is still convinced that IRQ 2 is responsible for the ohci_hcd.. anybody has an idea where?</p><p>Florian</p><p>P.S. I added the following code to the beginning of bcm47xx_fixup_device:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>  if ((d-&gt;bus-&gt;number == 0) &amp;&amp; (d-&gt;device == 0x4715)) {
    printk(&quot;PCI: ugly USB controller hack, changing irq %d to 5..\n&quot;,d-&gt;irq);
    d-&gt;irq = 5;
    pci_write_config_byte(d, PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE, d-&gt;irq);
  }</code></pre></div><p>P.P.S. The lone handler from dmesg at 0x8011d550 is serial8250_interrupt, so obviously the ohci_hcd didn&#039;t register IRQ 2 any more, but it&#039;s still triggered by the hardware.. even though lspci and /proc/interrupts are convinced it&#039;s at IRQ 5.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>floe</strong> on 8 Oct 2006, 21:11)</p>

					<p>Unfortunately, I don&#039;t have that log anymore. However, I found a workaround: I compile the serial driver into the kernel, but remove the external UART (which isn&#039;t part of the original hardware anyway <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> ). As no UART is present, the serial driver doesn&#039;t register any IRQ, the ohci_hcd module can be loaded and USB works - I mounted an USB stick yesterday just to check.</p><p>Of course, that&#039;s not really a fix, but if the USB interrupt can&#039;t be changed, then the only other solution would be changing the serial interrupt, and from what I&#039;ve seen in arch/mips/bcm947xx/broadcom/sbmips.c,&nbsp; this is set in sb_mips_init by sb_setirq. I doubt that simply changing it to 1 or 5 would work, though?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>floe</strong> on 10 Oct 2006, 21:09)</p>

					<p>I fixed it in r5160 by chaging the code that assigns the IRQs to sb cores on BCM4710. I simply removed the IRQ assignment for the unused ILINE20 core and gave that IRQ to the USB stuff... Seems to work now</p>									</div>
