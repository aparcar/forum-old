					<p>Hello</p><p>I got from a colleague an old but working Asus WL-500g deluxe router. I`ve got few ideas what to do with it. I have already added an additional USB port. I will use it as a print server, access point and a little NFS server. Since the router has only 4 MB of flash I need extroot to get more space. <br />print server must be CUPS - so it needs additional space for it jobs.</p><p>I have searched the forum for informations and read that the jffs2 is needed or Squashfs with building an image.<br />I build a jffs2 image but then only the default build takes 94% of space on /. So that gives me no space to install additional packages (usb support,&nbsp; file systems, ...):</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# df -h
Filesystem                Size      Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/root                 2.8M      2.6M    172.0K  94% /
tmpfs                    14.5M     32.0K     14.5M   0% /tmp
tmpfs                   512.0K         0    512.0K   0% /dev</code></pre></div><p>So even if I would include all the needed packages in the jffs2 image I would not be able to install it to the router.<br />I guess that the only way for me would be to build the Squashfs image. Now, all the tutorials presume that the extroot is performed on jffs2. Nobody wrote/tried to make an Squashfs extroot system with the needed packages in the compilation. </p><p>Could anybody please explain me which packages I have to include in the Squashfs image build to be able to perform extroot from it?<br />I will use external USB disk with ext4 partition + swap partition.<br />I have read the <em>Connect stuff to the USB port, USB Basic Support, USB Storage, Rootfs on External Storage (extroot), Fstab configuration</em> wiki documentation and I understand the concept. I just do not know which packages to include in the Squashfs image build to realize the system.</p><p>Thank you all in advance!</p><p>have a nice day,<br />vedro</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello</p><p>@ mazilo</p><p>So the only package I have to include during a Squashfs image build has to be block-mount? For the image building I use trunk version repository.<br />So in the Squashfs image is no the same when block-mount package is installed after the build? It has to be included during the new build?</p><p>I have installed Backfire RC5 on the router, installed the block-mount package and had no luck (although I went throughly the wiki documentation).<br />I tried the /overlay move to the external media and also had no luck. I have similar issues like in this <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=30923">forum topic</a>. When the /overlay had moved to external media, it`s size was the same as the size on the router memory and not as the usb drive size. Setting in fstab:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config mount
        option device   /dev/sda1
        option fstype   ext4
        option options  rw,sync
        option is_rootfs 1
        option enabled  1
        option enabled_fsck 0</code></pre></div><p>for extroot does not work for me. This is all done by the RC5 image version. So after that I started digging and found that with Squashfs image for extroot to work, has to be specially build. </p><p>So to sum up: the only package I have to include in the build is block-mount and the extroot for Squashfs image will work? (Sorry if my questions are a nag )</p><p>@ Thongil</p><p>Like I have written above to mazilo. I have installed backfire RC5 Squashfs image, tried extroot - had no&nbsp; success<br />Have also tried tomount external /overlay and the overlay partition on the external media was the same size as it was on the router.</p><p>Thanks you both for a quick reply.</p><p>Have a nice day,<br />vedro</p>									</div>

					<p>Vedro for mounting external /overlay you need to install block-mount block-extroot and block-hotplug. If you don&#039;t have these 3 packages it won&#039;t work, i had the same problem as you. Using backfire RC5 and these 3 packages you should do it.</p>									</div>
