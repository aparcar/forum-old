					<p>I have a configuration that depends on support Linux network namespaces (netns) in OpenWRT.&nbsp; The namespaces feature is unfortunately something that cannot be loaded as a module.&nbsp; Would this be a reasonable feature to enable in the official builds?<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>CONFIG_KERNEL_NAMESPACES=y
CONFIG_KERNEL_NET_NS=y</code></pre></div><p>The specific case that netns solves is: I have two routers in master-slave configuration.&nbsp; Both routers are configured with the same IP address.&nbsp; The master (OpenWRT) gets its IP address via DHCP from the ISP, then offers the same IP via DHCP to the slave.</p><p>While (to the best of my knowledge) this is not normally possible with Linux, but it can be done with namespaces.</p><p>An example manual configuration might look like the following.&nbsp; The slave router in this example would be plugged into a switch port on VLAN 101.&nbsp; Inbound ports can be forwarded to the slave device by redirecting them to 192.168.101.2 in OpenWRT.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>GATEWAY=9.8.7.1
PUBLIC_IP=9.8.7.123

# Create a namespace and enable forwarding
ip netns add fakewan
ip netns exec fakewan sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

# Create VLAN device on eth0, and create a VETH pair so we can route
# to and from the &quot;fakewan&quot; namespace
vconfig add eth0 101
ip link add slave0 type veth peer name slave1

# Move the VLAN and one of the VETH devices into the fakewan namespace
ip link set slave1 netns fakewan
ip link set eth0.101 netns fakewan

# Bring the interfaces up
ifconfig slave0 192.168.101.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
ip netns exec fakewan ifconfig slave1 192.168.101.2 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
ip netns exec fakewan ifconfig eth0.101 $GATEWAY netmask 255.255.255.0 up

# Set up default route and NAT rules
ip netns exec fakewan ip route add default via 192.168.101.1
ip netns exec fakewan iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o slave1 -j SNAT --to 192.168.101.2
ip netns exec fakewan iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -d 192.168.101.2 -j DNAT --to-destination $PUBLIC_IP</code></pre></div><p>I have this set up and fully automated with scripts I uploaded to github (<a href="https://github.com/Voltara/openwrt-fakewan">https://github.com/Voltara/openwrt-fakewan</a>), but it depends on custom-building OpenWRT with the requisite namespaces support.&nbsp; Although I can take care of myself in that regard, it&#039;s a potential barrier for others who might find this useful (i.e. anybody who has followed this guide <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/faq/16710">http://www.dslreports.com/faq/16710</a> and would love to remove an unnecessary device from their network.)</p>									</div>
