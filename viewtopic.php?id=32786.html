					<p>I probably could but rants like yours make me loose the interest to invest my spare time into your problems.<br />Go buy some support or hire a developer which you can yell at or ridicule his work.</p><p>Alternatively get your hands dirty and tweak the regulatory limits, its all open code, no binary blobs, no hidden firmware files.<br />Also if the UBNT firmware works so well for you, why using OpenWrt at all?</p>									</div>
