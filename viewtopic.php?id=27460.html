&quot;WDS&quot; &quot;Ad-hoc&quot; and &quot;client&quot; options).<br />I am sure there is no more hardware chipset needed,and DHCP server already install with OpenWRT. Is there anyone know how to set it as a wireless Router?<br />BTW, I dont think Vlan is good idea, first,the board looks like do not surpport VLAN, second, is there going be an problem of multi DHCP server in a LAN if I use VLAN?<br />Thank you in advanced.<br />Please help me here.</p>									</div>
