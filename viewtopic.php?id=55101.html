					<p>Well, you clearly know how to read a logfile, how much do you expect to shave off the boot time, what&#039;s the package(s) that take(s) too much time for you? In a regular boot process, most time is spent on network and wifi initialization, there&#039;s not really very much to save there.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 13 Jan 2015, 12:12)</p>

					<p>Sorry, I am not very skilled in understanding the logfile. I just read that some Linux systems can boot in a few seconds. Would it help to make a buildroot?</p>									</div>

					<p>No, not really. You <em>may</em> be able to shave a few seconds off the boot process, but that&#039;s about it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 13 Jan 2015, 14:19)</p>

					<p>Check your bootloader and minimize the boot delay if possible.</p><p>A lot of it is intentional delays to avoid &quot;race conditions&quot; like trying to up an interface before its kernel driver has probed the hardware.</p>									</div>
