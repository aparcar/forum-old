					<p>Hello-<br />&nbsp; In the Archer C7 V2 using DD, I noted that the popular USB3 HUB by &quot;Pluggable&quot; is not recognized when plugged<br />into the router directly, however it is recognized if it is plugged into a USB2 hub that is plugged into the router.<br />Works:&nbsp; C7 -&gt; USB2_HUB -&gt; USB3_HUB<br />Doesn&#039;t C7 -&gt; USB3_HUB</p><p>This result is unexpected, as USB3 hubs are backward compatible with USB2, and the C7 has 2 USB2 ports.</p><p>Full details of the USB configuration are in forum_dot_openwrt_dot_org/viewtopic.php?pid=340980</p><p>&nbsp; When using DD on a C7 with Samba, the ability to hang multiple drives off the hub is very nice.&nbsp; It would be good<br />to figure out why a setup that *SHOULD* work doesn&#039;t.<br />Best,<br />-Tom</p>									</div>

					<p>Anyone?&nbsp; This is a weird bit of non-functional behavior - surely someone is intrigued ?? (who has enough knowledge to root cause this)</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry - is the question whether this hub works with a PC? Answer &quot;yes&quot; - it works great - it&#039;s a very popular and excellent USB3 hub.</p>									</div>
