					<p>Sure.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t done it myself, but you should be able to compile on OpenWrt just like any other Linux box (if your platform has the resources needed).&nbsp; Just make sure you have gcc installed (and any other required packages).&nbsp; Also remember that you are limited on memory in comparison to a PC...&nbsp; and if you&#039;re compiling on your jffs partition, you are subjecting your flash to a lot of writes.&nbsp; It would be better to compile on an external device, such as a USB flash drive.</p>									</div>

					<p>one point to add from my side. i was working on some marvel 1ghz board with 512mb ram, it was a part of some project, I got debian on it. But compiling on it always too some 1:45 hours, while on my dual core desktop it took under 8 minutes.<br />so a word of caution. another thing is, if your flash if of bad quality it will die faster bcoz of all the temp stuff being created.</p>									</div>
