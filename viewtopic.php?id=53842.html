					<p>Hi, folks. I kinda figured this would be a FAQ but couldn&#039;t find anything here or elsewhere - not sure if I just got the wrong search terms, or what.</p><p>I&#039;m using CC (r42926) on a Zyxel NBG6716. I have a fairly default setup, and have configured all my various systems with static DHCP leases, so they get the same IP address from the router each time via DHCP.</p><p>It seems that if I have to restart the router for one reason or another, dnsmasq does not keep the DNS entries for the DHCP clients. So they&#039;re all still connected and working fine and can be reached via numeric IP addresses, but none of them can reach each other by their hostnames. I have to laboriously ssh into each one and restart its networking, or wait X hours until their DHCP leases expire.</p><p>Is there any way to avoid this, so the DNS entries will remain over a reboot, or say configure OpenWrt such that dnsmasq will always have an entry for any static DHCP lease configured, regardless of whether that clientt is actually currently connected?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenWrt does not store the dhcp client list into the non-volatile memory by default, because the write cycles on the flash memory is finite. and often guaranteed for about 10 000-cycles or so.</p><p>The default location for the lease file is: /tmp/dhcp.leases<br />You could simply edit the file /etc/config/dhcp and change the option leasefile to /etc/dhcp.leases for example.<br />Or via the command line using uci:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cp /tmp/dhcp.leases /etc/dhcp.leases
uci set dhcp.@dnsmasq[0].leasefile=&#039;/etc/dhcp.leases&#039;
uci commit dhcp
/etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart</code></pre></div><p>But a better solution is to add a inexpensive usb stick to the router to store the dhcp leases on that.<br />of course you could also add dns entries manually next to the static dhcp leases.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>FriedZombie</strong> on 6 Nov 2014, 22:11)</p>
