					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have build openwrt from trunk and flashed it on my DIR-300, but after rebooting I can&#039;t login via telnet. The firmware seems to boot fine (leds flashing from&nbsp; right to left twice), but it doesn&#039;t answer to telnet or ping. Considering my configuration strategy[1], is there a list of packages and configurations absolutely necessary for telnet to work?</p><br /><br /><p>[1] whenever I see a kernel-style menuconfig, I disable everything I don&#039;t know and wait for error messages</p>									</div>

					<p>You would be suprised. However, hotplug2 is definitely needed. Now, as I can login and set a password, I got stuck at the networking config. I put a preconfigured file in trunk/files/etc/config/networking which turned up in the image but was modified. Is there any way to protect this file from vlans and wan interfaces? The real problem is, when I change the files in /etc/config, they get reset after every reboot. Now, I have a pretty much standard build configuration and overlayfs seems to work. What could have gone wrong here?</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># mount
