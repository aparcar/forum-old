					<p>Good Afternoon,</p><p>My friends and I are working on a project pertaining to wifi channel switching based on interference. We purchased the Netgear WNDR3400v3 router as a cheap testing platform. We successfully installed Openwrt onto the router but inside of ect/config/ there is no wireless configuration file. We have searched this site for about a week and cant find a list of devices that support wireless. Can anyone give us advice.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the advice. I recently read the purchasing guide and it says to stay away from those as well. I had searched the hardware link before hand. We have the v3, which should have wireless capabilities. We will most likely try and re-flash the firmware and if there still isn&#039;t ect/config/wireless, we will purchase a better router without the Broadcom drivers.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hmm, I had to install the wifi driver separatly.</p><p>Check the wiki page of your device what wifi chip your router has, then go to the Wireless owerview wiki page<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/wireless.overview">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/wireless.overview</a><br />And check the driver section. Maybe you just need to install &quot;kmod-b43&quot; to get wifi working<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>opkg install kmod-b43</code></pre></div><p>If you got wifi working but you also need wpa security you also need the packag &quot;wpad-mini&quot;<br />for more details see the config wifi encryption page:<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless/encryption">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless/encryption</a></p>									</div>
