					<p>Oh sorry, but what i meant was that the way that they used the openwrt is a shit. Openwrt allows you to improve your router and let you use it the way you want and what they&#039;ve done is to remove it&#039;s all features...</p>									</div>

					<p>Matheuz, you&#039;ve got a serious problem, and it&#039;s not in the firmware. Openwrt is a good firmware and there are good people in this forum, but the way you speak you will be in the wrong section everywhere.</p>									</div>

					<p>telnet or ssh are ways to connect to the console (linux-shell) of the router.</p><p>I guess you are using windows so get <a href="http://www.putty.org/">putty</a> and try to connect to your router. username is root.<br />if you can connect through ssh. check is sysupgrade or mtd are available than use WinSCP to copy the firmware to the router and use sysupgrade or mtd to flash it.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you don&#039;t know the password, you should reset the router first. This is done by quickly pressing and releasing reset button during startup. After a while, one of the leds starts flashing quickly (now is router in failsafe mode with ip address 192.168.1.1), you will have to set your pc manually to use it 192.168.1.2 and then you can telnet to the router using tool putty (you will have to use radio button to switch to telnet in putty, ssh is checked by default). Telnet user name is root, no password needed in failsafe. You will have to write command firstboot (which will erase current config) and then using command passwd you can set your password for user root, which will also disable telnet. Then turn router off and on and it should be in a clean state, ready to flash new firmware, or for your config. Finaly you can use putty to ssh to your router.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 8 Feb 2013, 22:52)</p>

					<p>You will have to follow exactly what I told you, or you will not get anywhere, you have to use 192.168.1.2 as your comuter&#039;s ip address (set it manually on ethernet interface) and to the putty box write 192.168.1.1.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi! I believe I have the same problem, I installed an alternative version of AA called SIMETBOX ( <a href="http://simet.nic.br/firmware/simetbox-tl-wr740n-v4.bin">http://simet.nic.br/firmware/simetbox-tl-wr740n-v4.bin</a> ) but after some time it stopped connecting to internet (the wan Interface doesnt seem to work and i could not fix it). I want to go back to the original firmware but I&#039;m not sure if there is anything I shoud care about first, like if there is a bootload on that image etc. Is there any way to install the firmware by putty?</p>									</div>
