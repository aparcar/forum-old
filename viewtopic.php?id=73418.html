					<p>Am using LUCI to monitor and configure my openwrt device. I can create/delete user using the LUCI web interface. </p><p>My aim is to create an anonymous user which will not be displayed in the user list of LUCI interface. For that I edited the files /etc/passwd. This was a success, I could create user,use this him to do my stuffs and also he is not displayed in the LUCI interface. </p><p>The real issue is when I create a new user from LCUI the user which i created using /etc/passwd disappears. <br />Am I doing some mistake.?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Oops,</p><p>this subject interests me very well, because it would be very useful for me to have a user who could only see reporters without changing anything of configuration, I could not be able to do that, and in the searches I did not find anything talking about how to do, can you guide me?</p>									</div>

					<p>As I said earlier I Just wanted a user who is not displayed in the LUCI web interface. And its very easy to achieve, that you can add a user manually, by editing the /etc/passwd file. And also I have done some modification in LUCI application to support multi layer user login. That is giving user privilege to specific user groups (Super admin/Admin/User)</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Very interesting, you could pass which LUCI files and what you changed ?, my idea and create only a user who can only see the interface without being able to change any aspect, just follow the various reports displayed ....</p>									</div>
