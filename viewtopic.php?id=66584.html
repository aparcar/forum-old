					<p>well ive done this before what ive done is</p><p>1. setup a client mode wifi all you have to do is scan for your WISP SSID broadcast and connect to it.<br />2. once youre connected to your WISP you need to register that as a WAN connection so edit or create a new interface and select the interface of the wireless client. Set the firewall to WAN and after that your WAN interface should get a IP from your WISP provider.<br />3. at this point you should have a internet connection if youre connected to your router wired. <br />4. to make a AP just go to wifi and create a new wireless AP and make sure to include that new wifi interface to your br-lan interface or whatever your local network interface is.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, </p><p>Trying to understand the operating mode(s) of OpenWrt I found a tutorial (original in Portuguese) that helped me to understand some concepts and I decided to share it in the forum:</p><p>(Source: <a href="http://luizluca.blogspot.com.br/2012/01/openwrt-turbine-seu-roteador.html)">http://luizluca.blogspot.com.br/2012/01 … ador.html)</a></p><p>&quot;...<br />During configuration of OpenWRTwe do not see the usual Linux interfaces (eth1, wlan0, ...). What we find are interfaces of &quot;higher level&quot; as LAN and WAN. These interfaces can be mapped directly to a single router interface (now yes eth0, etc.) or joining them into a bridge. By default, there are two interfaces: WAN (Wide Area Network) and LAN (Local Area Network). The WAN is usually composed only of an interface (eth1), usually detached from other ports used to connect to the Internet. The LAN is a bridge that joins the eth0 (LAN ports) and the wireless interface (wlan0). In general, it does not change the LAN, and WAN operates configured by DHCP, PPPoE, depending on your Internet provider.</p><p>OK, so far as any router. But now comes the flexibility of OpenWRT. The functions of the interfaces can be: modified switched, joined, or divided as the administrator wants.</p><p>The wlan0 interface can join with the WAN, the LAN ports may be used for multiple connections to the Internet or put it all together and make the router a single point of access (access-point) without any routing. Someone might ask, &quot;but the ports of the local network, those 4 are mapped to a single interface, eth0?&quot;. Yes, they are. But this is not a limitation. Although, by default, they are together, the ports, if the HW permits, can be isolated in several networks send packets with VLAN tags, and so on.</p><p>And what about the operating modes. There is a good range of operating mode options from the classic &quot;AP&quot;, through the simple Ad-hoc and more interesting things like mesh networking (802.11s), WDS client or server, or even behaving like a of wireless client common, connecting to another wireless router. There is also the mode &quot;monitor&quot; to perform capture of wireless packets.</p><p>Another interesting thing may not be noticed. In setting the Wifi there is a button to &quot;Add.&quot;</p><p>Add what?</p><p>Another wireless configuration. If the HW enable, and usually allows, you can have multiple wireless network settings, operating in different ways, with different passwords with different SSID, each representing an interface.<br />...&quot;</p><p>(Translated with Google Translator)</p><p>Many thanks for attention,<br />Markos</p>									</div>
