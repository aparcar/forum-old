					<p>Hi all, new to the forum and OpenWRT in general</p><p>I was able to install OpenWRT onto my WNDR3400, I got the webGUI installed, and the wireless &#039;working&#039; but only the 802.11bg protocol. 802.11a doesn&#039;t work, and more importantly, neither does 802.11n. I used ssh and opkg install brcmsmac which seemed to install correctly, but that did not help solve my problem either. </p><p>Any advice for a noob?</p>									</div>
