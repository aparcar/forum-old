					<p>So how come i can&#039;t select 5ghz and then enable 40mhz in advanced, it just disables itself then. Only 20mhz will work, why?</p>									</div>

					<p>I have a wndr3700 and the hardware can do 40MHz both in 2,4GHz and 5GHz, in 2,4GHz you are only allowed to use 40Mhz if your neighbourhood&nbsp; is not to crowded, I&#039;m not sure if this applies to 5GHz too. But if this is the case check if there is another AP on your channel(s) or if you are using a channel that allows only 20MHz. And check if your clients networkcard supports 40MHz (I have a Intel 4965 which allows only 20MHz on 2,4GHz, 40MHz works only on 5GHz) </p><p>And maybe post /etc/config/wirless and the output of &quot;iw list&quot; and &quot;iw wlan[0 or 1] station dump&quot;&nbsp; for a start.</p>									</div>

					<p>And make sure that you enable a &quot;legal&quot; 40 MHz channel. Select a channel from the middle of the spectrum and test there.</p><p>E.g., if you use 1 as the main channel, make sure to use HT40+ (you can&#039;t use HT40-, as there is no channel 0). Similarly, do not try to use a channel that is not allowed by the crda settings for your country.&nbsp; See also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels</a></p>									</div>
