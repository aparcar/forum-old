					<p>Heya!</p><p>I have some performance issues with the wifi using my wl-500gp and my laptop.<br />Wifi works fine when im in close proximity to my router, however if i move away (quite a bit) i get packet loss and the connection is unstable and eventually lost.<br />(I suppose im at the edge of the area a wl-500gp supports, so i dont think its anything wrong with my unit.)</p><p>Now i have read some posts where the broadcom miniPci was exchanged for a Atheros based card.<br />And since i have nothing against running a 2.6 kernel i thought i might give it a go.</p><p>However i do have a few questions before i rush to the store and buys the first best card.</p><p>From what ive read the AR500X based cards works fine.</p><p>Do a/b/g work flawlessly?<br />Is 108Mbps supported, and does it work?<br />Is there any performance gain to the signal quality / strength / range?</p><p>And as stated here: <br /><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=11620">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=11620</a> and here <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=12261">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=12261</a></p><p>The XR2 / SR2 based models work.<br />How well do they work?<br />Are there power supply issues as stated in post 2?<br />Is there any performance gain to the signal quality / strength / range?</p><p>Since my main objective is to get a greater signal strength and range im hoping the XR2 / SR2 works.</p><p>I appreciate all the help i can get.</p><p>Greetings</p>									</div>

					<p>Changing to a higher powered card will do nothing for range if the laptop is not also increased in power.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>I would recommend a higher gain antenna on the router which helps in both transmit an receive.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have gone as high as a 15 dbi gain omni with awesome results.&nbsp; &nbsp; Of course these require pigtails and external mounts.&nbsp; But you can also get quite a bit of improvement with the 9 dbi rubber duck antennas.</p><p>15 dbi omni:<br /><a href="http://www.bizsyscon.com/product.php?id=1952">http://www.bizsyscon.com/product.php?id=1952</a><br />Pigtail:<br /><a href="http://www.bizsyscon.com/product.php?id=2448">http://www.bizsyscon.com/product.php?id=2448</a></p><p>9 dbi omni:<br /><a href="http://www.wlanparts.com/product/O24-9RPSMA/2.4GHz_9dbi_Rubber_Duck_RP-SMA_Antenna.html">http://www.wlanparts.com/product/O24-9R â€¦ tenna.html</a></p><p>The stock antenna if I recall is only 2 or 3 dbi gain.&nbsp; &nbsp;About every 3 dbi gain doubles your range, but walls and other obstacles will still be a larger factor than distance with indoor wireless.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lschweiss</strong> on 26 Oct 2007, 18:34)</p>
