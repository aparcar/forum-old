					<p>Hi,</p><p>I compiled my own OpenWRT for a WAG354Gv2 to be used as a simple ADSL modem. Another unit is handling the firewalling and routing.</p><p>I have it configured ok to connect to the ISP using PPPOA.</p><p>I don&#039;t need it to NAT as the other unit has a public IP too.</p><p>My question is, how do I get OpenWRT to transparent? Ideally have the public IP address given by PPP also assigned to the LAN port. I think this might be called &quot;half-bridge&quot;.</p><p>Cheers.</p>									</div>
