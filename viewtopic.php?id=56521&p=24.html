					<p>Don&#039;t feel bad about not spending time on the documentation. The work that you both have done so far is critically important, and thus far, wasn&#039;t even visible to anyone who wasn&#039;t looking hard. (Besides, you can&#039;t write documentation for a process that we don&#039;t fully understand - I would say that we&#039;ve only come to that point in the last week or so...)</p><p>Now our task is to create a comprehensive guide to how we want people to add new routers. This includes finalizing the Technical Detail template, creating a similar Device Details template, and a final form for the new ToH (which will probably have some instructions on it...) </p><p>I don&#039;t think we should look at the Bureaucracy plugin now - it&#039;s a new piece of technical work that could take us weeks to get working the way we want. (Or not - but I still think it would be a distraction from getting the new ToH published.) Besides, there won&#039;t be too many new routers added to the ToH while we&#039;re figuring out how the Bureaucracy plugin works. </p><p>Finally, I encourage you to update the demowiki page with any improvements you have.

					<p>@richb: Your deletion of the () for the example values and your request to simplify the creation of new dataentries made me think, also triggered by the dropdowns mentioned above.</p><p>Why triggered by the dropdowns?<br />The dropdowns are self explanatory and show you what is expected.<br />Dropdowns make some comments and example values unnecessary, e.g. yesno values like serial, vlan; or like modem (i.e. predefined comma separated list of valid values. Definition is done in the dokuwiki admin area). </p><p>1) Now if we start with a completely empty copy of the template, we see ... almost nothing of the dataentry when viewed as normal wiki page (i.e. not in the wikisource).<br />Reason: Fields with no value are not shown by the dataplugin, when viewing the normal wikipage. However, those empty fields will be shown in the editor.</p><p>Seeing almost nothing of the dataentry is bad. The user needs at least a slight hint. -&gt; Include at least Brand = (EXAMPLE) in the otherwise empty template.<br />This way, the dataentry box will show at least &quot;Brand: (EXAMPLE)&quot; -&gt; hint, what to do next -&gt; &quot;Edit the box showing Brand: (EXAMPLE)&quot;</p><p>Only when the user edits the dataentry via the editor (not via pageedit), he will see the full dataentry with all fields.</p><p>-&gt; Turns out, that completely empty template does not really help the user in estimating what to do next. No good look&amp;feel.</p><p>2) Since the above empty template has issues, example values are needed in the template to show all available fields already in normal page view (i.e. not in pageedit mode).</p><p>3) Users do not remove example values, if they don&#039;t know what to enter instead. -&gt; Example values without any marking will stay there forever, or until someone verifies it (which may take long).</p><p>4) Example / Bogus values must be marked somehow -&gt; add () around them.</p><p>5) Coming back to the dropdowns from above: No example value needed -&gt; No confusion if values are to be entered with or without () :-)</p><p>To close the loop from the beginning and to summarize:</p><p>Simplification of creation of new dataentries<br />- by reducing number of example values in ()<br />- by introducing dropdowns for selected fields (clickable ¿, no need to enter it manually:)<br />- by telling the users more exactly what to do with the values in () -&gt; to be done</p><br /><p>Further simplification: No &quot;create new page, then copy&amp;paste,...&quot; etc. any more.<br />Instead, click a button, enter brand, model, version -&gt; new page in correct namespace created automatically -&gt; edit further via the dataentry editor.</p><p>This is a bit different compared to the method I was talking about in the past (bureaucracy plugin).<br />I have been playing around with bureaucracy, and although it offers some nice functionality (dropdowns), it lacks some of it in other areas (no comments shown). This makes me think of bureaucracy as only second best.</p><p>IMHO currently best in terms of functionality and ease of use: A dataentry page, filled with example values. Still to do: Creation of new page &#039;with a click&#039; only. I&#039;ve seen some plugins around for this purpose -&gt; should be doable.</p><br /><p>To close the loop from the beginning and to summarize once more:<br />Simplification of creation of new dataentries<br />- OLD: via bureaucracy plugin<br />- NEW: via (tbd)-plugin + template filled with example values in ()</p><p>You see, your stone-throwing made me think, which lead to a new idea on how to proceed.<br />Keep on throwing those stones! ;-)</p><br /><br /><p>P.S.: If this posting seems too long and confused, I blame it on the high temperatures %-)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tmo26</strong> on 7 Jul 2015, 00:07)</p>

					<p>I&#039;ve been away, but you&#039;ve all been working.</p><p>Now that the ToH-generation machinery is in place, my primary goal is to make this self-sustaining. To do that, we need to give people enough information to &quot;do it right&quot; when they add a router to the wiki.</p><p>- On a macro scale, that means we need the introductory material I put at the top of the demowiki page. It may not belong there (I&#039;m not sure where it goes), but it needs to be visible at the point that someone realizes, &quot;Hey, I want to add a router to the ToH!&quot;</p><p>- On a micro scale, I&#039;m trying to guess (and that&#039;s all it is) what the template should contain so that people will &quot;do it right&quot;. In the current example, putting (...) around bogus entries will tell *us* that people haven&#039;t changed it. But my first thought (a couple months ago) when I saw the parentheses was that these were *required*, and that I dare not leave them out because &quot;something might break&quot;.</p><p>So this is a hard design process, and we&#039;ll probably make mistakes. But we shouldn&#039;t let that concern paralyze us.

					<p>I know, it was supposed to be a background task... however, I couldn&#039;t resist in checking out ways to easily create new dataentry pages. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I came back to the bureaucracy plugin, but only for the pure creation of the page and filling in Brand, Model and Version into the page.

					<p>@zo0ok:</p><p>The creation of new dataentry pages implies some changes to the brand-naming you apply: Since the namespace and filename are derived from the user input &quot;Brand&quot;, which may be D-Link or TP-Link, we need the &#039;-&#039; inbetween. Otherwise we would have the pages created by you in dlink/, whereas the automatic created pages would be in d-link/.</p><p>Changes needed for dropdowns in the dataeditor: Adding of special datatypes<br />Supported Since Rel_release<br />Supported Current Rel_release<br />Target_target<br />Flash MB_flash<br />RAM MB_ram<br />Modem_modem<br />VLAN_yesno<br />WLAN Stds_wlanstds<br />Serial_yesno<br />JTAG_yesno<br />LED count_led<br />Button count_button<br />Bootloader_bootloader</p><p>Can you update the datapages accordingly, please?</p><p>Further suggestion: Split &quot;Wired ports&quot; in &quot;Wired ports 100M&quot; + &quot;Wired ports Gbit&quot; -&gt; enables dropdowns also for these fields -&gt; More clicking, less typing, less inconsistent data.</p>									</div>
