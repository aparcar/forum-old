					<p>I am not 100% if this is the right category or not but here goes.</p><p>I can compile a AR231x/AR5312 (&quot;atheros&quot;) based pico2 image and flash it just fine (recent SVN checkout) which only can do up to 802.11g (the Picostation M2-HP can do 802.11n at 2.4GHz).</p><p>Now if I select the AR71xx/AR7240/AR913x/AR934x one from the menuconfig and compile, it generates a bunch of different images but not a &quot;pico2&quot; one.<br />The image for the &quot;bullet&quot; (&quot;openwrt-ar71xx-generic-ubnt-bullet-m-squashfs-*.bin&quot;) that is made does not work (it will fail to flash with a &quot;invalid firmware&quot; error).</p><p>I wanted to find out how I can make a new target for the Picostation M2-HP so that it&#039;ll use the proper modules/drivers for the wireless and also use the proper signatures so that it&#039;ll be recognized when flashing.<br />Any suggestions?</p>									</div>
