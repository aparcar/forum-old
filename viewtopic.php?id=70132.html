					<p>Hi,</p><p>I want to create a network of OpenWrt docker machines which are connected(virtually) via wireless interfaces (like how a normal IOT home system would be connected). <br />I am currently running an OpenWrt image using docker on my desktop. Wireless interfaces are not supported on my desktop.</p><p>I just wanted to know if someone has tried simulating a wireless interface&nbsp; in OpenWrt virtual machines.</p><p>I build the OpenWrt image from scratch using the build system.<br />I am able to simulate a wireless interface on my host system (running ubuntu 16.04) using mac80211_hwsim kernel module and it is working fine. But I am unable to replicate it on my openwrt docker machine.</p><p>I have tried various configurations for the OpenWrt docker system but nothing seems to be working.</p><p>This is the hostapd config file that I used :</p><p>interface=wlan0<br />driver=nl80211<br />logger_syslog=-1<br />logger_syslog_level=2<br />logger_stdout=-1<br />logger_stdout_level=2<br />ctrl_interface_group=0<br />ssid=Vamonos Pest<br />country_code=US<br />hw_mode=g<br />channel=1<br />beacon_int=100<br />dtim_period=2<br />max_num_sta=255<br />rts_threshold=2347<br />fragm_threshold=2346<br />macaddr_acl=0<br />auth_algs=3<br />ignore_broadcast_ssid=0<br />wmm_enabled=1<br />wmm_ac_bk_cwmin=4<br />wmm_ac_bk_cwmax=10<br />wmm_ac_bk_aifs=7<br />wmm_ac_bk_txop_limit=0<br />wmm_ac_bk_acm=0<br />wmm_ac_be_aifs=3<br />wmm_ac_be_cwmin=4<br />wmm_ac_be_cwmax=10<br />wmm_ac_be_txop_limit=0<br />wmm_ac_be_acm=0<br />wmm_ac_vi_aifs=2<br />wmm_ac_vi_cwmin=3<br />wmm_ac_vi_cwmax=4<br />wmm_ac_vi_txop_limit=94<br />wmm_ac_vi_acm=0<br />wmm_ac_vo_aifs=2<br />wmm_ac_vo_cwmin=2<br />wmm_ac_vo_cwmax=3<br />wmm_ac_vo_txop_limit=47<br />wmm_ac_vo_acm=0<br />eapol_key_index_workaround=0<br />eap_server=0<br />own_ip_addr=127.0.0.1</p><p>Has anyone been able to do this successfully? If yes, what are the modules and drivers&nbsp; I should&nbsp; be using to get it working?</p><p>If any extra info is required from my side, please let me know. I am new to all this.</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenWrt wifi and other settings should be configured through the uci system.&nbsp; uci reads files in /etc/config and generates &quot;low level&quot; configuration files (such as hostapd-phy0.conf) dynamically into /var/run.&nbsp; /var/run is on a RAM disk so it must be regenerated every boot up. </p><p>So install kmod-mac80211-hwsim then set up /etc/config/wireless as if you had a real wifi device and see what that does.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the reply.</p><p>But any attempt to start the wireless service (or even the network service) fails with &quot;Failed to connect to ubus&quot; error.<br />I tried debugging it but the internet has not proved useful in debugging the error.</p>									</div>
