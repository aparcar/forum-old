					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am currently using an init.d script to initialize a GPIO using &quot;/sys/class/gpio export&quot; command. This works fine, but It takes far too long after bootup before this gpio is initialized. </p><p>I am wondering if it is possible/how to initialize this gpio to my preferred settings (direction, active low) from &quot;make kernel_menuconfig&quot; or some other place, essentially removing the need for an init.d script in hopes the gpio is initialized far quicker after power up. I have the build environment setup so I can edit any files and build the image, just need to know where to look. Any ideas? </p><p>Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>supergeen</strong> on 24 Apr 2018, 02:09)</p>
