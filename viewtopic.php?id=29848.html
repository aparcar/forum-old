					<p>Hi!</p><p>What is the antenna orientation of Netgear WNDR3700v2?</p><p>I used it to replace an old Canyon CN-WF514 and noticed, that a distant client (different story in building) had about 10 Mbps internet transfer speed with the Canyon, while with the Netgear it has 5 Mbps.</p><p>The WNDR3700v2 is placed horizontally and the client is above it.</p><p>I could try N different positions, but I thought I listen to the wisdom of other users first.</p><p>Regards,<br />David</p>									</div>

					<p>That is not an option, as the WNDR was purchased to replace the old one:<br /> - to better handle NAT load<br /> - better WLAN performance<br />Having both somehow defeats the purpose... (and add more light to the bedroom at night...)</p>									</div>

					<p>1. no problem, use the netgear as the router and the canyon as an AP<br />2. you will have better performance on both bands<br />3. duct tape the LEDs <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Not as many as 2.4 GHz parts of course. This article is from 2010: <a href="http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/wireless/wireless-reviews/31089-80211n-adapter-roundup">http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/wireless â€¦ er-roundup</a></p><p>BTW if G clients are used at the same time as N clients on the same band, performance will suck for everyone. Although, if either one is not used often, you can get away with it.</p>									</div>
