					<p>I have been through the process of setting up OpenVPN and PPTP clients on OpenWrt VLANs, but in this case, I just want a LAN client to be able to connect to the VPN at my office.&nbsp; I am unable to connect from either my iPhone (iOS 8.4) or laptop (Windows 7).&nbsp; Both are configured correctly and can connect successfully when accessing the internet from any other router/connection.</p><br /><p>I have never had a problem connecting to it on any router or firmware in the past, so I am wondering what the deal is.&nbsp; I know that on the server-side router, you need to open up 1723 and accept gre traffic, but I have never been required to do any configuration on the client-side router to allow for connections to be made.</p><br /><p>I am on CC trunk (WRT1200AC).&nbsp; Any thoughts?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fecaleagle</strong> on 22 Aug 2015, 21:00)</p>
