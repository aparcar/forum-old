					<p>Hi, I&#039;ve been trying to configure this router for a few days and now it seems to work, but when it has been working for an hour, more or less, it erases every torrent on the download list. Doesn&#039;t seem to have any kind of configuration wrong, and don&#039;t give any error...</p><p>Any ideas?</p><p>thank you for your help <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m having another troubles getting this to work, and it is that when I plug an usb device, the router hangs and i can&#039;t access or do anything. I thought it could be a power supply problem, so I tried to make de HDD get its power from another USB (USB cable with 2 usb plugs) and it kept doing it. Now I&#039;m trying with an USB pendrive, and it does as well...</p><p>Just stay with the WPS light blinking and do nothing...</p><p>Also, as I said early on this post, there was a moment when work fine (except for the download list erasing itself...)</p><p>Sorry if I&#039;m not understandable, the english is not my first language XD</p><p>Thanks for all</p><p>PS: This is the router, for more info:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://cdn0.sbnation.com/entry_photo_images/2291883/TL-MR3020-portable-3g-wireless-router_large_verge_medium_landscape.jpg" alt="http://cdn0.sbnation.com/entry_photo_images/2291883/TL-MR3020-portable-3g-wireless-router_large_verge_medium_landscape.jpg" /></span></p>									</div>
