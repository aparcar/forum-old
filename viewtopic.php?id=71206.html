					<p>I&#039;ve been trying for a couple weeks to get an openwrt WAP working in esxi. I have been able to install openwrt and pass a usb wireless adapter through to the vm successfully. After that I run the following commands...</p><p>opkg update&nbsp; <br />opkg install kmod-rt2800-lib kmod-rt2800-usb kmod-rt2x00-lib kmod-rt2x00-usb&nbsp; <br />mv /etc/config/wireless /tmp&nbsp; <br />wifi detect &gt; /etc/config/wireless</p><p>I then restart the VM and when I go to the network tab in the Luci interface there is a Wifi option, but I have the dreaded &quot;0% Wireless is disabled or not associated&quot; message. At this point I have been looking all over the past couple weeks and tried everything I could find including...<br />-changing the channel to auto, and various numbers<br />-changing the hwmode to n, g, ng, etc.<br />-adding the disabled &#039;0&#039; line<br />-changing the htmode to HT20, HT40, etc.</p><p>...and various others. No matter what I do I can&#039;t seem to get the wifi interface to enable. Is there something blatantly obvious I&#039;m missing?</p>									</div>

					<p>The appearance of the SSID on the air means that the wifi driver and hostapd are generally working.&nbsp; Run <strong>logread -f </strong>to watch the system log while you attempt to connect.&nbsp; Since hostapd is a user-space process, it does not log to the dmesg kernel log.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 13 Jun 2017, 15:24)</p>

					<p>While I did do research about the adapter, maybe I didn&#039;t dig deep enough. Is there a specific nano USB adapter that someone has tested with openwrt on ESXi and everything works?</p>									</div>
