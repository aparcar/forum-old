					<p>You can ignore the warning.<br />OpenWrt&#039;s gcc/g++ is patched to search all its libraries and includes relative to the $STAGING_DIR environment variable. If this environment var is not set, you get the warnign above.</p><p>Best is you do something like &quot;export STAGING_DIR=/path/to/your/target-dir&quot; prior to calling make. The target-dir is the directory that contains the &quot;lib&quot; and &quot;include&quot; subdirectories with includes and libraries for your target system.</p><p>I think eclipse should offer some option to export environment variables somewhere, put in the STAGING_DIR there.</p>									</div>

					<p>mitja.gti</p><p>Sorry I don&#039;t have time to evaluate your settings in detail, actually OpenWrt is just a hobby during my spare time...</p><p>Since you don&#039;t have completed the 2nd step , you wont be able to debug with eclipse because gdb does not know where the source code is located.<br />As far as I know all(most?) source packages are extracted and built in build_dir/.., some build results are copied to staging_dir e.g. toolchain binaries. c-header , etc.</p><p>You have to change the debugger settings not the project properties settings.<br />Please see last picture of chapter 8 (gdb Debugger setup), there you can see the gdb &quot;Source&quot; settings window, on the right side next to &quot;Debugger&quot; settings:<br />open that window and add your desired &quot;Source Lookup Path&quot; somewhere located at build_dir/target*/libmircohttpd*.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m afraid this topic has nothing to do with compiling packages. It&#039;s about remote debugging.</p><p>You&#039;ve already posted 3 posts in 3 different topics.

					<p>eclipse configuration has changed since this OpenWRT with Eclipse Howto was published. The v 3.8 eclipse command File -&gt; New -&gt; C++ Project now shows only one toolchain option &quot;GNU Autotools Toolchain&quot;. Is this the correct option for OpenWRT?</p><br /><p>Should one use File -&gt; New -&gt; Makefile Project with Existing Code?</p><p>Any pros offer a little guidance, pls?</p>									</div>
