					<p>Hi,</p><p>We have openwrt 12.09 (r36088) on a customer with qos-scripts enabled. The router gets the IP from PPPoE, and the speed tests before enabling QoS are normal. 10M/800K.</p><p>The thing is there are issues when uploading stuff (sending big email, launching iperf against a server on the internet). Sometimes the machine with XP stalls (specially when there is other traffic from other computers going on), meanwhile the Win7 computers have no trouble, they just adapt to the available bandwidth.</p><p>When we disable qos-scripts, both machines work correctly (apart from the increased latency, obviously), but the point is that the packet loss at the router (because the DSL is maxed out), doesn&#039;t make the XP machine to stall... not even once.</p><p>Does anybody else experience this behaviour? I&#039;ll make some packet captures when I get there, but I&#039;d appreciate any clue on what&#039;s happening.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Julian.</p>									</div>
