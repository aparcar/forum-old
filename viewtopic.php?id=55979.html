					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to make an owncloud server accessible from the internet with self signed certificates (obviously it needs to be encrypted). I have a separate linux box, which would serve as the owncloud server. I&#039;ve got the owncloud server working with internal 192.168 beginning address, in LAN. I have spend hours googling, but I can&#039;t find the answer how to forward the traffic coming to WAN port 443 to the owncloud server port, so that it works with https... I&#039;ve tried to adding a alias IP to owncloud servers eth0, the same as my WAN IP... might be that its either openwrt configuration issue, or apache/certificate configuration issue...</p><p>I&#039;m really/clearly not an expert in networking or https... Am I trying to do impossible things? Would really appreciate advice. I have Attitude Adjustment installed on my router/AP box.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Looks like the problem is in your HTTP server: it should respond with external name as server name, not internal ip address; this is not a &quot;man-in-the-middle attack&quot;, as your router is just redirecting packets.</p>									</div>

So you have done it, you can help. Here comes the answers...</p><p>1. In Luci, Network -&gt; Firewall -&gt; Port Forwardings: </p><p>copy paste from luci interface:<br />htpc ssl<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />IPv4-TCP<br />From any host in wan<br />Via any router IP at port 443<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />IP 192.168.10.2, port 443 in lan</p><p>and this configuration is made the same way for SSH. Only difference in creating it, was that I did not include UDP. SSH just works.</p><p>2. I&#039;m testing from WAN, as in, with my smart phone using the 3G connection. Definately different IP. Not via WLAN.</p><p>3. I have no such restrictions on my network connection. I have used network scanners found via google, that scan my ports. Even one, which tests the https server. That port is open.</p><p>So, this must be just my failure to configure the apache correctly. And / or create self signed certificate correctly. Can you provide me with copy of your apache config? Method of creating certificate, with all inputs?</p><p>Thanks <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

Or you could use the external IP address (or a FQDN that resolves to that address), but you will have to configure the router to redirect all internal traffic to your public IP address (never did this, either). Or you could use the external name, and configure the DNS in your router to resolve that name to the internal IP addres; this is what I did.</p>									</div>
