					<p>I tried using &quot;netstat -luntp&quot; to identify listening services along with their process IDs (PID), but the Kamikaze 7.09 netstat (dropbear?) version does not allow the &quot;p&quot; option for listing PIDs. </p><p>The best I can do is &quot;netstat -lunt&quot;, but this does not show the PIDs.</p><p>Is there a way for me to identify listening services along with their PIDs without installing additional packages that may be available for OpenWRT (such as lsof, fuser and sockstat), or do I have to install one of these?</p><p>Are the PIDs stored in a file somewhere by default, or is there an option to create/enable such a file with dropbear at startup?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>SR</p>									</div>
