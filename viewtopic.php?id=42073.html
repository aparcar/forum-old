					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;m wondering if there is anybody who has a working Site 2 site VPN tunnel between an openwrt device and a pfsense firewall.<br />I&#039;m struggling to get this to work and do not seem to find what i&#039;m doing wrong.<br />The tutorial of Ville leinonen seems pretty straightforward but helas...</p><p>I just want to create a openVPN client to connect to PfSense with certificates. (not a shared key).<br />How do i set the correct configuration? Do i need to create a new interface? Do i jave to set firewall rules?<br />And if so, how do i do this?</p><p>greetings,</p><p>Stijn</p>									</div>
