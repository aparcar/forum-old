					<p>FWIW, I installed the daily build (from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/)">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/)</a> as of a few days ago and it failed to come up normally.&nbsp; It would come up in failsafe mode if I hit the button a few times, but I was unable to make it come up in normal mode.&nbsp; I suspect it was due to the mtdblock not getting mounted correctly, as mount_root also failed to work in failsafe mode. I spent a little time trying to debug it with rtz on IRC, but was unable to get it to work. I&#039;ve since switched back to the factory firmware.</p><p>Anyway, my question is: is there a better build or source of a build that I should be using?</p>									</div>

And with 9K frames I can achieve about 50MB/s copy speed from NSA-220 nas to workstation. With default 1.5K its about 20MB/s.<br />I think when chip supports it then its down to module and kernel network stack to do the rest.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sala</strong> on 15 Feb 2010, 13:10)</p>

					<p>Hi Guys,<br />thanks for your efforts for this, to all involved.<br />i have been following this thread but cannot understand everything because for some reason i cannot find what I need to strat understanding OPENWRT. <br />I took a leap of faith and installed this firmware<br /><a href="http://openwrt.groov.pl/WR1043NDv1/r19581/">http://openwrt.groov.pl/WR1043NDv1/r19581/</a><br />logged on via telnet. changed password for root and installed webif (i could not get luci to work + i do not know which is better at what).<br />I managed to setup the wireless and have changed some settings, namely hwmode, in the /etc/config/wireless file but the maximum wireless connection i get is 130mbps.<br />anyway i can get this to connect at 300mbps? Also I am from Malta. I set the country to MT is it correct? </p><p>Another thing i would like to ask is if i can make the router block incomming connections from certain ip ranges. idealy I edit a file like the ipsec.conf on the QNAP ts-210.</p><br /><p>Thanks again and I apologise if i went of topic for some reason....<br />Not intentional.</p>									</div>
