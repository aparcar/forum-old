					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;m considering replacing my current ADSL router with a D-Link DSL-G604T running OpenWRT (I&#039;m aware that I&#039;ll need to hack on it to make it work).</p><p>Before I do so, I&#039;ve got two simple questions:</p><p>1) How is the IP175A switch configured? Is there an EEROM attached for storing its configuration data, is it programmed via the MII registers, or is it hardwired?</p><p>2) Where can I find the TI WLAN driver source mentioned in <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/AR7Port">http://wiki.openwrt.org/AR7Port</a>?</p><p>As background, I&#039;d like to end up with the following setup:</p><p>* ADSL using PPPoA, with native IPv6 and IPv4 - my ISP provides both native IPv6 and tunnelled,&nbsp; and the goal is to stop using the tunnel (purely for the geek value).<br />* WLAN, ADSL, and all but one of the switch ports on three different VLANs; these VLANs going down the final switch port to my existing firewall (OpenBSD based, and I&#039;d rather not change it). This can be done if I can program the switch chip (I&#039;ve checked the datasheet), assuming the WLAN is handled by the CPU (as in the AR7 reference designs).<br />* Some form of encryption on the WLAN, maybe WPA, maybe WEP, whatever I can get working <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>If doing this with the DSL-G604T isn&#039;t going to be possible (hardware limits), recommendations for alternate ADSL2+ and OpenWRT hardware would be appreciated.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Simon</p>									</div>
