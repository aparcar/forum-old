					<p>Hello Folks</p><p>First post here - but, many posts to X-WRT forum; on that topic I&#039;d just like to say how sad I am that the activity on that project seems to have dropped off and say a big thank you to thepeople and lubek who have offered me their wisdom on many occasions.&nbsp; I notice that the forum is no longer up and wonder if it could be offered as an archive somewhere so the information it contains might still be available for all?</p><p>Problem: I attempted to flash my WRT54GL to openwrt-10.03-wrt54g-squashfs-xwrt-extra.bin about 6 months ago via web interface (1st mistake, I know).&nbsp; It failed about 1/2 way through, all subsequent attempt to flash either via web interface or via tftp also failed and it seemed I had bricked my machine.&nbsp; Then in desperation I tried to flash the latest linksys firmware (4.30.14 build 5, Oct. 26, 2009) which to my surprise, worked.&nbsp; I have finally become totally frustrated with the linksys firmware (again) for all sorts of reasons too numerous to mention.</p><p>So, what&#039;s happened?&nbsp; I wonder if somehow I&#039;ve left a chunk of broken firmware on the rom which is preventing me from uploading the openwrt firmware, but which allows enough space for the linksys firmware - trouble is, size of openwrt-10.03-wrt54g-squashfs-xwrt-extra.bin is 3.1MB and size of FW_WRT54GL_4.30.14.005_US_20091026.bin is 3.2MB, so the math for that hypothesis doesn&#039;t work.&nbsp; Is there any tool for &quot;reformatting&quot; the rom and leaving it in a known good state?</p><p>Does anyone have any other idea what the problem might be?</p><p>Also, can anyone help with the location of the latest xwrt builds of openwrt as I can no longer find the openwrt-10.03-wrt54g-squashfs-xwrt-extra.bin I downloaded 6 months ago (though that might be a more descriptive renaming of the original; it might haven come from somewhere like <a href="http://downloads.x-wrt.org/xwrt/kamikaze/10.03-snapshot/brcm47xx/extra/openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin">http://downloads.x-wrt.org/xwrt/kamikaz â€¦ uashfs.bin</a> , but that&#039;s not there any more).</p><p>Many thanks,<br />Morgan.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pseud</strong> on 21 Aug 2011, 02:17)</p>
