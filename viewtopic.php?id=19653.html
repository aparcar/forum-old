					<p>Hi,</p><p>Im trying to bridge traffic received from eth0 to ppp0 and traffic received from ppp0 to eth0.&nbsp; I can&#039;t use NAT.&nbsp; I am able to create a bridge and assign eth0 to use the bridge but when i try to assign ppp0 to the bridge I get the following error.</p><p># brctl addbr bridge1<br /># brctl addif bridge1 eth0<br /># brctl addif bridge1 ppp0<br />br_add_interface: Invalid argument</p><p>Is there another way to bridge eth0 and ppp0? In my current implementation I am using a bridge that bridges eth0 to eth1 and it works great, now i want to use ppp0 instead of eth1.&nbsp; Anyone have any ideas how I would do that?&nbsp; Is there another tool that I should be using or is a bridge the wrong approach?</p><p>Thanks</p><p>watts</p>									</div>

					<p>Is there another way of doing this then.&nbsp; I basically need all IP traffic that comes in eth0 to get routed out to ppp0 and all ppp0 IP traffic to get routed to eth0.&nbsp; I need this to look like 1 interface such that the IP address of the ppp interface is the only IP address of the system.&nbsp; Its similar to bridging but not really.&nbsp; I have been looking at the advance IP routing how-to&#039;s but haven&#039;t found much.&nbsp; Ill post something if I find anything but if someone has a recommendation on how to do this it would be greatly appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>you want the unit to route (= send packets from one interface to another on basis of criteria) but that requires the interfaces to be distinguishable, i.e. not be bridged (= anything happening on a bridged interface gets replicated to the other interfaces it forms a bridge with).</p><p>I guess you can do what you want on basis of source routing:<br />Disable in the ppp0 setup the setting of a default gateway.<br />Usin the &quot;ip route&quot; and &quot;ip rule&quot; commands:<br />create two route tables that contain different default gateways, and one table with common routes.<br />Create rules that depending on source interface assign the other interface as gateway.<br />Some script snippets:</p><p>pubip=$(ifconfig ppp0 | grep &#039;inet addr&#039; | awk &#039;{print $2}&#039; | sed -e &#039;s/.*://&#039;) # public dynamic IP<br />gwyip=$(ifconfig ppp0 | grep &#039;inet addr&#039; | awk &#039;{print $3}&#039; | sed -e &#039;s/.*://&#039;) # ISP P-t-p gateway IP<br />### populate the table [200] with routes equal for all <br />ip route flush table 200<br />### the native interfaces (are set by OS in &#039;main&#039; but need being set manually in table [200]) <br />ip route add to $gwyip dev ppp0 protocol kernel scope link src $pubip table 200&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # ppp0<br />ip route add to 192.168.1.0/24 dev vlan0 protocol kernel scope link src 192.168.1.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; table 200&nbsp; &nbsp; # vlan0 here as example 192.168.1.1 <br />ip route add to&nbsp; &lt;vlan1 subnet&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; dev vlan1 protocol kernel scope link src &lt;ip address vlan1&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; table 200&nbsp; &nbsp; # vlan1 <br />### populate table [201], the ppp0 gateway<br />ip route flush table 201<br />ip route add to default via $gwyip dev ppp0 table 201<br />### populate table [202], the eth0 gateway<br />ip route flush table 202<br />ip route add to default via &lt;vlan0 ip address&gt; dev vlan0 table 202<br />### now define rules for table selection, starting with highest priority<br />ip rule delete from 0/0 priority 50 table 200<br />ip rule add from 0/0 priority 50 table 200<br />ip rule delete&nbsp; &nbsp; iif eth0 priority 51 table 201<br />ip rule add&nbsp; &nbsp; iif eth0 priority 51 table 201<br />ip rule delete&nbsp; &nbsp; iif ppp0&nbsp; &nbsp; priority 52 table 202<br />ip rule add&nbsp; &nbsp; iif ppp0&nbsp; &nbsp; priority 52 table 202</p><p>In the above deletions precede additions.

					<p>I did some more research.&nbsp; Turns out this IS possible.&nbsp; It&#039;s called Half-bridiging or PPP bridging.&nbsp; I just cant seem to find any info about it in modern kernels.&nbsp; It seems to be from an old 2.4 patch that seems to be lost.&nbsp; Anyone know much about this, this is what i really need.&nbsp; If someone could find the 2.4 patch i would happily port it to 2.6.</p>									</div>

					<p>The the cradle point box in the link below is EXACTLY what I need to do.&nbsp; Any ideas on how I can do this.&nbsp; I should be able to do this with my NSLU2 right?&nbsp; I am configuring a 3G Mobile gateway for my car and as a backup modem connection if my cable goes out. I also want to hook up my laptop in the car to get a public IP address via Ethernet (what I really want to do).&nbsp; I need to get a public IP address just like the cradlepoint described in the link below.&nbsp; I also want to use it as a high availability failover system with a bonded Ethernet interfaces.&nbsp; I already got the 3G modem working, i just want to pass that IP address on to whatever device is plugged into the Ethernet interface.Your thoughts and suggestions are greatly appreciated, I&#039;m stumped.&nbsp; &nbsp;If cradlepoint can do it Linux can do it, even though they use a proprietary OS it should not be that far fetched.</p><p><a href="http://store.drwireless.com/crceippabrad.html">http://store.drwireless.com/crceippabrad.html</a></p>									</div>
