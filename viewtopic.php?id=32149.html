					<p>DAP-1305: <a href="http://www.dlink.ca/products/?pid=753">http://www.dlink.ca/products/?pid=753</a></p><p>First of all, the DAP-1305 is meant for people who travel a lot.. even has a faux-leather travelling case, USB to DC-AC adapter, USB-A to USB-A for power and host (..untested).</p><p>The device has a small &quot;mode&quot; switch, AP/RT/CL, for Access point (bridge), Router or Client.</p><p>I got this device a little while ago to work around some of the current limitations of OpenBSD&#039;s 802.11 stack, mainly, HostAP support is incomplete and a lot of portable devices don&#039;t play well with it.. due to lack of Wifi power saving features.</p><p>While unpacking it a GPL notice slip fell out, I had hoped there was already some sort of community support for custom firmware on this particular device from 2010.. however, all that exists is two source tarballs on dlinks ftp server.</p><p>I spent a few days installing a distribution of Linux on my laptop to sort through the source dump and try to see if it included everything needed to build a firmware. The good news is, yes, it does. Unfortunately a lot of modifications are needed to get the build system to play nice, it assumes root permissions.. and bails trying to build the bundled applications.</p><p>The really good news is it includes a copy of the rootfs image as a tarball, all firmware modules (..blobs/cgi/http docs) are in the image, and the included kernel does compile.</p><p>Once I extracted that, I had to modify a few build scripts, fix up permissions and create a suitable image that can be flashed via the HTTP interface.</p><p>So far all I&#039;ve changed on the firmware other than the kernel is rc.d/rcS (..to start telnetd), add a few iptables rules and add a dmesg binary so I could include it with my post:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>&lt;5&gt;Linux version 2.6.21 (brynet@xxxx) (gcc version 3.4.2) #423 Thu Sep 8 19:35:30 EDT 2011

					<p>Hello, newbest of all newbies here.&nbsp; also i&#039;m lazy at times (choosing my binges).&nbsp; </p><p>i have been frustrated by the fact (?) that the usb port is not shareable (usable) in the DAP 1350 client mode (does the usb self power thing prevents its use for signal transmission?).&nbsp; I was wondering what changes, if possible, and with a lazy perspective, would the code you presented or the original GPL code, need to have in order to allow usb port sharing in wireless client mode, allowing some sort of print server ability to this nice little device.&nbsp; </p><p>I don&#039;t need the usb powerability, btw.</p><p>Also, do you think i could build the binary that could be flashed via http interface, in a virtual linux machine on my windows, on some minimal linux-windows interface (smaller than cygwin).</p><p>Would you be able to provide me with a binary of your code for flashing?</p><p>Any answer or bits or hints are welcome.&nbsp; Also, if i&#039;m completely and appartently clueless, feel free to point that out.</p><p>PS: also please allow for some english syntax singularities, not my first language. %-)</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not sure if I should be redistributing this, but here is a my firmware for the North American DAP-1350. It&#039;s modified stock, mostly original with the exception of a few changes.</p><p><strong>UPDATE OCTOBER 2014, I&#039;m no longer hosting this firmware. You should<br />be running OpenWrt Barrier Breaker 14.07 or newer instead. The factory<br />stock firmware is STILL VULNERABLE. So don&#039;t use it, or mine! :-)</strong></p><p><strong>NOTE: This firmware was based on 1.11, the latest firmware is 1.13. A<br />vulnerability was also discovered effecting stock firmware (..including<br />the one below). See <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=187150#p187150">here</a>.</strong></p><p>=====</p><p><a href="http://devio.us/~brynet/DAP-1350_A1_FW_111NA_telnetd.bin">http://devio.us/~brynet/DAP-1350_A1_FW_ … elnetd.bin</a><br />SHA1 (DAP-1350_A1_FW_111NA_telnetd.bin) = 091faaae24dc88a89c053f119068e1db4b82c040</p><p>1) The kernel was recompiled, the build configuration was changed to enable <strong>CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_PHYSDEV</strong>.<br />2) The companion iptables module was added to <strong>/lib/iptables/libipt_physdev.so</strong>.<br />3) <strong>/etc/rc.d/rcS</strong> was modified to block port 23/80 over wireless to the device (..but still forwarded), this prevents access to the web configuration interface over HTTP and also restricts telnet access.<br />4) I compiled and added <strong>/bin/dmesg</strong> to the image.<br />5) I have customized <strong>/etc/passwd</strong>, the root password is <strong>dap1350</strong>.. and it can&#039;t be changed.</p><p>The rest of the userland is from the rootfs image distributed in the GPL source tarball, unmodified.</p><p>I&#039;ve only tested this firmware in AP mode, but I don&#039;t predict any issues running in the other modes. No guarantees or anything etc, also, it&#039;s a RAM filesystem so any changes you make will not be preserved.</p><p>You can flash back to a vanilla firmware over HTTP.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>brynet</strong> on 26 Oct 2014, 21:25)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the quick responses!&nbsp; I&#039;m not worried about USB support or exploits, I&#039;m just looking for a tiny device to use as a wireless-&gt;ethernet bridge on my (secured) home network besides the TP-Link TL-WR703 (which will take like a month to ship from China).</p><p>I&#039;m specifically looking for OpenWRT-compatible devices -- of which there don&#039;t seem to be many in a &quot;pocket-sized&quot; form factor -- because I&#039;ve already encountered some routers that don&#039;t support bridging, and have been able to easily install OpenWRT on a cheap Asus router to achieve a similar goal at my brother-in-law&#039;s house.</p>									</div>
