					<p>Hi Guys,</p><p>The same as my post in the White Russian thread... I was just wondering if there are any supported routers that have a built in ADSL modem?</p><p>I have a project that I need to get into that requires a single device as apposed to the WRT54GL and DSL modems that I have been using until now.</p><p>I don&#039;t really care about the make/model and if the price is below $100 retail that would be a bonus.</p><p>Any thoughts will be appreciated.</p><p>Shawn</p>									</div>
