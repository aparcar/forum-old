					<p>Hey there.</p><p>Well. The subject sounds like &quot;dude, RTFM&quot;. But let me explain why I raise this question.</p><p>Think about this:<br />* Network A has a couple of hosts<br />* Network B has a couple of hosts as well<br />* Networks A and B are connected through a NAT router allowing A to connect to B but not the other way around.<br />* I can freely place any hosts in both of those networks<br />* But I cannot place a host in both of them</p><p>I need to achieve routed connectivity in both directions, so basically work around the NAT limitation from A to B.</p><p>My idea was to simply put a VPN server in network B, a VPN client in network A, make them connect and deploy static routes from A to B and reverse throgh that VPN.</p><p>So: Security is not my convern. </p><p>The only requirement is getting the link with the least possible configuration established.<br />A VPN setup with username/password is o.k., copying some certificate strings from one UI to another works as well. But being required to adjust configuration and credentials via command line is a no go.</p><p>I just tried openconnect. But even when its configured nicely and working, just rebootig one of both routers results in an 80% chance both nodes refuse to connect.</p><p>Any suggestions?</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>									</div>
