					<p>I have been working with my WRT54GL 1.1 quite a bit. I&#039;ve been reading how to&#039;s and googling info quite a bit as well. I am trying to get the setup described in this documentation: <br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/KamikazeConfiguration/NonBridgedWiFi">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Kam … ridgedWiFi</a><br />to work on my WRT.</p><p>I believe that I have a fairly solid understanding of the Kamikaze/WRT54GL network setup (and I think that I&#039;ve got it setup correctly), I can get the interfaces setup and the DHCP working correctly.&nbsp; But when I try to start shorewall,&nbsp; I&#039;m stuck with errors similar to:</p><p>/var/lib/shorewall/.start: /var/lib/shorewall/.start: 1374: ip: not found<br />ERROR: Unable to determine the routes through interface &quot;wl0&quot; </p><p>This causes my shorewall to fail out and not start. This happens whether I try to start shorewall with &#039;/etc/init.d/shorewall start&#039; or &#039;/sbin/shorewall start&#039;, the latter being more verbose in it&#039;s progress. I have also disabled the built in firewall with the &#039;/etc/config/firewall disable&#039; command prior to trying to start shorewall.</p><p>I thought that this may have something to do with the routes on the system (as the error describes). So, I have manually entered routes. (route add -net 192.168.2.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.2.1 dev wl0). This shows correct (to my knowledge) in the &#039;#route&#039; command. But, I get the same errors when I try to start shorewall after the route is in place. If I disable the wl0 interface and only do the lan and wan interfaces (eth0.0 and eth0.1), I get similar errors referencing the eth0.0 interface.</p><p>I found out that installing the shorewall package from the ipkg package didn&#039;t get all the required pre-requisite packages and I have run the following to get what I think is necessary prior to installing the shorewall package: </p><p>#ipkg install iptables iptables-mod-extra iptables-mod-iprange iptables-mod-ipset iptables-mod-nat iptables-mod-ulog iptables-utils</p><p>Does anyone see anything obvious that I&#039;m missing or have a direction to point me in? Help much appreciated.</p><p>I would edit the iptables directly, but frankly, I don&#039;t know enough about iptables and hoped that shorewall would give me an abstraction layer that would help to get the firewall setup in place.</p><p>-b</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you!! That worked and it has put to rest hours of searching around.</p><p>For other novices like me, this is the format that I&#039;ve used for loading needed pre-requisite packages (and the shorewall package) to get shorewall running:</p><p>#ipkg update<br />#ipkg install ip iptables iptables-mod-extra iptables-mod-iprange iptables-mod-ipset iptables-mod-nat iptables-mod-ulog iptables-utils shorewall</p><p>Note the &#039;ip&#039; entry at the beginning of the 2nd line. After I loaded ip as suggested above, all appears to be working correctly. Charlie, thanks again.</p><p>-Brian</p>									</div>
