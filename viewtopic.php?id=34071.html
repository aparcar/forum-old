					<p>Hello,</p><p>As a newbie on this forum I hope I&#039;m not breaking rules and if yes ...sorry for that. I Googled for this problem but could not find a solution.</p><p>I have a WNDR3700 with openWRT and it works like I want except after the update the LuCI is switched off and the root password has changed.</p><p>i first installed the factory.img (<a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-wndr3700v2-squashfs-factory.img">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … actory.img</a>) for my router. No problem here. no I updated yesterday with this <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-wndr3700-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … pgrade.bin</a><br />I update because my WD USB disk wouldn&#039;t mount in any way.</p><p>After this the Vlan, pppoe and everything works like before except the root password has changed and LuCI is unavailable. Telnet is off. So all settings seem to be there only I have no acces to the router anymore</p><p>What can I do to restore the password and get Luci up and running again?<br />I tried the changeme, just enter or my original but no luck.<br />I need to setup a VPN and minidnla.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>
