					<p>Another misconception is, that when you put your own code under GPL that you loose any copyright of it.<br />(and that other&#039;s think they can do whatever they want to do with it)<br />You can still use it in commercial programs.</p><p>And yes, you can mix GPL PROGRAMS&nbsp; and not so open/commercial programs&nbsp; - Suses YaST was an example for that (now also open source).<br />For example, you can take openwrt and write a commercial closed source GUI&nbsp; for it.

					<p>Well at least some of the semi-knowledgable people just moved other places.&nbsp; As I said, I don&#039;t even mind the idea of paying for a support forum. Providing a place with a useful roof over your head implies rent. If occasionally the owner drops in and provides help too that&#039;s nice. I used SveaSoft on about a dozen WRT in a community Wisp for quite a while.&nbsp; I paid the $20 subscription fee. The software was pretty cool, and the forums were useful.&nbsp; I used to post a lot there, helping the n00bs, as repayment that some of them had helped me out with my issues.</p><p>Around the time of Talisman first release, I dared to question James one day about why his download site was down for 3 days without notice, he called if flaming and booted me. All I said was it didn&#039;t seem very professional to have the site down but refuse to comment on what&#039;s going on. He would log onto forums, answer other questions but ignore any questions about the download site.&nbsp; I work in a datacenter and within minutes of any service being down we post notices everywhere about system status.&nbsp; It avoids a lot of pestering and it&#039;s professional. He doesn&#039;t believe in that sort of thing. First I was threatened with a terse email, then I noticed some of my posts deleted and one that mentioned DD-WRT had &quot;an Alchemy fork&quot; substituted in the text. Very childish. Then I was booted entirely when I refused to agree to be silent about it.</p><p>The trick in doing a good organization, is to have someone sharp and personable at the front of it like Linus. They don&#039;t have to answer every question or personally DO all that much. But they have to attract the kind of people who can make it all work. As the example of the kind of person you do NOT want at the center of a community that judges people based on merit and their cooperative nature, I would name James Ewing. The thing succeeded so well for a while not because of him, but in spite of him. There are many people who have neat ideas.&nbsp; Sometimes those people are ill-suited for the task of running the show.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 21 Mar 2006, 01:19)</p>

					<p>It seems that paranoia never ends. My access to sveasoft site has been completly denied. It seems he is silently droping any connection atempt from my static ip address. As if there are no dial-ip, dynamic dsl ip addresses, and anonymizers anymore ..... <br />If only he used all that time programming and supporting subscribers instead of chasing ghosts .... :-) James, James ... did I treat you so badly?
