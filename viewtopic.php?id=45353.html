					<p>I&#039;ve been trying to get a usb interface working for this router.&nbsp; It has the pinouts for a header on the board less some resistors and such. I am not even entirely sure the interface I wired up is correct but I followed the idea from the TP-LINK tl-wr741nd.</p><p>I need a version of the firmware compiled with usb in the kernel (if I understand correctly) to be able to access the usb port. I can&#039;t even verify if my interface is working properly otherwise. I issue lsusb and I get the error &quot;unable to initialize libusb: -99&quot;</p><p>I decided to do a bit of digging because other routers I know require a patch to get the usb to work. In luci the dlink router says its a TRENDnet TEW-712BR. I decided to add the lines #include &quot;dev-usb.h&quot;&nbsp; and ath79_register_usb(); to /target/linux/ar71xx/files/arch/mips/ath79/mach-tew-712br.c&nbsp; but this doesn&#039;t do anything, so my guess is this is not the right file and or I am not in the right place.</p><p>I&#039;ve also socketed the eeprom so any changes I make to the firmware can very easily be reverted back to stock firmware. I noticed that the luci interface doesn&#039;t seem to want to flash new firmwares as I compile them so this has helped me a lot.</p><p>I really appriciate any help I might recieve. I will be in the meantime tinkering on my own and see how far I can get.</p><br /><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y72/Nedemai/1_zpsce7a8d27.jpg" alt="http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y72/Nedemai/1_zpsce7a8d27.jpg" /></span></p>									</div>

					<p>is it possible that is something related to R211 and R212 on the board...? which are just beside the usb connector and seems to be missing.</p><p>is your usb port is working... do you have any power on?</p><p>this could be useful :<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr703n/ar9331_pinout#usb.interface">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl- … .interface</a></p>									</div>

					<p>I have a DIR-601 B1 as well as a WR703N which also uses the ar9331 SoC. Here is a zoomable, reverse-engineered schematic for the WR703N:</p><p><a href="http://squonk42.github.io/TL-WR703N/">http://squonk42.github.io/TL-WR703N/</a></p><p>The two inline resistors R101 and R102 (R211 and R212 on this board) are 0R or zero ohms. As well, there is an MMBD7000 power switching diode on each data line (D1, D2). I&#039;m guessing those diodes are replaced on this board by C173 and C174 which seem to be grounded. On the VBUS line from the USB connector there are two capacitors C113 and C115.</p><p>Dunno if that helps.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lobonse</strong> on 10 May 2014, 02:50)</p>

					<p>How about this? It&#039;s ar9331 based.

					<p>-- SOLVED --, I just got USB working! You were right about editing the file mach-tew-712br.c although your directory may be wrong. What worked for me was to run make and THEN go to build_dir/target-mips_34kc_uClibc-0.9.33.2/linux-ar71xx_generic/linux-3.10.34/arch/mips/ath79/ and edit that version of the file, same as you did:</p><p>#include &quot;dev-usb.h&quot;<br />and<br />ath79_register_usb ();</p><p>In the same directory, also edit this file:</p><p>Kconfig</p><p>Add</p><p>select ATH79_DEV_USB</p><p>after editing the section looks like this:</p><p>config ATH79_MACH_TEW_712BR<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; bool &quot;TRENDnet TEW-712BR support&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; select SOC_AR933X<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; select ATH79_DEV_ETH<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; select ATH79_DEV_GPIO_BUTTONS<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; select ATH79_DEV_LEDS_GPIO<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; select ATH79_DEV_M25P80<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; select ATH79_DEV_USB<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; select ATH79_DEV_WMAC<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; select ATH79_NVRAM</p><p>then run make again, and use the sysupgrade file.</p><p>For the hardware mod, I used this for reference:</p><p><a href="http://img198.imageshack.us/img198/6154/usb740nv4png.jpg">http://img198.imageshack.us/img198/6154 … nv4png.jpg</a></p><p>I used a 100uF capacitor and two 10k resistors, then drew the 5v from a 5v bus running off the router power adaptor. The hardest part was the soldering of the two data lines where the resistor pads are empty. Just a couple pieces of wire to bridge the gaps are fine, since they are supposed to be 0R or zero ohm resistors.</p><p>Pictures near the bottom of this page: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=33231&amp;p=4">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 31&amp;p=4</a></p><p>Cheers!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lobonse</strong> on 14 Jun 2014, 22:19)</p>
