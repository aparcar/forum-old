					<p>I uploaded from the web interface.

					<p>Thanks to RinaGute for providing the patched firmware, I was able to reuse it in my own Kimax U35WF.<br />However, when trying to bridge wireless and ethernet interfaces and setting it as DHCP client, it never got IP address and I couldn&#039;t access it any more.<br />Failsafe mode wasn&#039;t helpful (I couldn&#039;t access it on 192.168.1.1), so I had to use the Serial console. Using info from this post: forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=305747#p305747 I managed to connect the UART pins to Teensy board and over a serial console I was able to set the proper IP address to access the device again.</p><p>I don&#039;t know what was the problem, but it&#039;s working fine with a static IP address, so that&#039;s how I&#039;ll leave it.</p><p>If anyone is interested, here is the code for Teensy 2.0 to translate characters from virtual COM port on computer to physical UART serial port and back:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#define HWSERIAL Serial1
const int ledPin = 11;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  HWSERIAL.begin(57600);
}

int lastLight;

void light() {
  lastLight = !lastLight;
  digitalWrite(ledPin, lastLight);
}

void loop() {
  int incomingByte;

  if (Serial.available() &gt; 0) {
    incomingByte = Serial.read();
    HWSERIAL.write(incomingByte);
    light();
  }

  if (HWSERIAL.available() &gt; 0) {
    incomingByte = HWSERIAL.read();
    Serial.write(incomingByte);
    light();
  }
}</code></pre></div><p>Here is a photo of the setup:<br />postimg.org/image/l6xt09hrj<br />Note that you have to connect both grounds, Teensy RX, TX (pins 8 and 9, marked D2 and D3) to TX, RX pins on U35WF (pins 6 and 7 counted from left on the front of the big connector between the two boards - fortunately it&#039;s more accessible than on the U25WF), respectively.<br />TTL voltage levels difference (3.3V in U35WF, 5V in Teensy) seems to cause no trouble without any conversion.</p><p>I guess any Arduino or similar board could do the same job as Teensy, I just had it lying around.</p><p>Sorry about the unclickable links, I guess I&#039;m not allowed to post links (that&#039;s really stupid, OpenWrt, btw.)</p>									</div>

					<p>I just received my Kimax BS-U35WF (the bigger, boxier one that fits a 3.5&quot; drive, had MTK MT7620N written on a chip inside).

					<p>Well, I got impatient, uploaded the #3 &quot;full&quot; image, and promptly regretted it. My BS-U35WF turns on, lights flash, but I can&#039;t find any way at all to interface with it.<br />When it starts there&#039;s plenty of LED activity - red, blue, both, Ethernet LEDs, but after about a while it settles down to a steady red LED and intermittent flashes from the Ethernet LEDs.<br />It doesn&#039;t have a wifi signal.<br />Connecting the USB3 cable causes a greyed-out drive to appear among my devices - can&#039;t do anything with it.<br />It&#039;s connected via Ethernet to my router. The router log shows only this after turning on the BS-U35WF.<br />Jan 16 21:40:32 E3000 daemon.info dnsmasq-dhcp[707]: DHCPDISCOVER(br0) 20:0a:8e:7b:14:bc <br />Jan 16 21:40:32 E3000 daemon.info dnsmasq-dhcp[707]: DHCPOFFER(br0) 192.168.1.3 20:0a:8e:7b:14:bc <br />I can also find the device under the &quot;Device List&quot; section of my router shortly after it starts. It shows it&#039;s a &quot;br0&quot; interface, which I think means &quot;bridged&quot;. Not sure of the implications of this. However, it disappears after a minute or two, or if I try to use PuTTY to ssh or telnet to the IP address. PuTTY or browser requests time out.</p><p>If there&#039;s any way to fix this, please let me know. Otherwise I&#039;ll just trash the device in a couple weeks. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>Thanks,</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>alazyworkaholic</strong> on 17 Jan 2017, 01:54)</p>

					<p>Hello friends.<br />I tried all the available firmware for this device, which is only found. And work khshad, phuonglm, RinaGute, and they all behave completely differently in so far as concerns mount that drive.<br />Firstly, there is a problem with the mounting section mtdblock5, I understand that it should expand the root partition? Here is the log from the firmware of all authors:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> 0.490000] 4 ofpart partitions found on MTD device spi32766.0

What am I doing wrong.<br />Third, I have never failed to enter safe mode, telnet interrupts the saints according to the timeout.<br />Who needs the firmware, please, I have the original version since 1.2.2 to 1.3.5 and dump flash memory.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>filin.rsb</strong> on 29 Jan 2017, 18:54)</p>

					<p>I tried and Breed loader, very much, but it does not work the original firmware.<br />Someone tell me how to connect to the firmware of the author RinaGute disk with partitions ntfs? Tried different options, or ntfs-3g is not installed, or does not see the drive when added to the fstab file, although blkid sees it.<br />My native language is Russian, I ask forgiveness for the mistakes.</p>									</div>

Then disable DHCP server for Ethernet.<br />You may also config wlan to act as a DHCP server on a different network and config forward rules on firewall {my first choice until configuration got stable) or config wlan as a AP bridge with no DHCP server.</p>									</div>
