					<p>Dear members and visitors,</p><p>Recently I bricked my TP-LINK MR-3420 v1 router and had to debrick it. </p><p>In order to share what I learnt I have written a tutorial and published it in my blog. For anyone that is interested here is the link:</p><p><a href="http://redacacia.me/2013/03/07/debrick-your-tl-mr3420-router-with-a-serial-ttl-cable/">http://redacacia.me/2013/03/07/debrick- â€¦ ttl-cable/</a></p><p>The tutorial is mostly covered ground.
