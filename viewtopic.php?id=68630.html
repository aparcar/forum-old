					<p>Hello.&nbsp; My goal is to build a better (and cheaper) 4G router than my current Netgear LG6100D (Sprint).&nbsp; I purchased a Sierra Wireless MC7455 and a wwan to usb adapter with sim card slot.&nbsp; My router is a brand new Linksys WRT1900ACS which I have loaded a fresh copy of the latest stable OpenWRT firmware.&nbsp; My problem is I can&#039;t get any of the drivers to load for the MC7455.&nbsp; I have installed the following packages:</p><p>kmod-usb-net-sierra<br />kmod-mii<br />kmod-usb-net<br />kmod-usb-wdm<br />kmod-usb-net-qmi-wwan<br />uqmi</p><p>When I look at the devices (cat /sys/kernel/debug/usb/devices), the end of every driver line says (NONE).&nbsp; It recognizes the Sierra MC7455 correctly so I know it&#039;s seeing it at least.&nbsp; It just refuses to load any drivers, hence when I run the command ls -l /dev/cdc-wdm0 it always says no such device.&nbsp; One thing is I tried with both the uqmi and sierra packages loaded and also with just the uqmi loaded, but not with just the sierra package.&nbsp; I will try that tonight.&nbsp; I have also taped up pins 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, &amp; 33 on the MC7455.</p><p>I just don&#039;t know much about Linux to even begin to troubleshoot this.&nbsp; I was hoping to issue a few commands and get it working.&nbsp; The more websites/forums I read the more confused I get. I even read somewhere that I would have to install it in my Windows computer and load Sprint specific firmware onto the MC7455 first.&nbsp; And another site says you can&#039;t just switch the module back and forth between Windows and Linux because it&#039;s mode would change or something.&nbsp; </p><p>Are there any step by step instructions on getting a module like the MC7455 working as a 4g USB modem in a router with OpenWRT software?&nbsp; This 4G Netgear Router from Sprint is a big pile of crap and I need something fast and reliable.</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help you might offer me and if I can provide any other specific information.</p><p>Keith</p>									</div>
