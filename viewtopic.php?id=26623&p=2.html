					<p>B1 and B2 are vendor hardware revisions. Trunk refers to the SVN tree, and r18621 to the version of the SVN tree from which version on it supports a given feature. Kamikaze is not trunk; Kamikaze is a branch, just like Backfire, and specific versions of those branches will be (or has been) tagged as release version.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Borromini</strong> on 11 Nov 2010, 15:25)</p>

Usually runs DHCP server as well.<br />In typical scenario it connects to provider using PPPoE, PPTP or L2TP.&nbsp; Or using WISP (Wireless ISP)</p><p>--&gt; for such scenario <a href="http://www.netgear.com/products/home/wirelessrouters/work-and-play/WNR3500L.aspx">Netgear WNR3500L</a> is a good choice. It has 8MB Flash/64MB RAM<br /> You can avoid problems with Broadcom (if any) by disabling wireless</p><p>2) Wireless Access Point (WAP)<br /> Connects different wireless clients in your apartment/building to this WAP.<br /> Another device (Router/IGD) handles connection to Internet and NAT.<br /> NAT/Firewall are not needed. DHCP is optional.</p><p>My choice here is Atheros chipset - as it would work well for item 3) too.<br />Just make sure that you are not paying extra for functionality you don&#039;t need (NAT, Firewall, Extra Ethernet LAN port)<br /><a href="http://vplessky.blogspot.com/2010/10/tp-link-tl-wa801nd-wireless-access.html">TP-Link WA801ND</a> or <a href="http://www.tp-link.com/products/productDetails.asp?class=wlan&amp;pmodel=TL-WA901ND">WA901ND</a> offer good value.<br />And they would work with stock firmware (which is using Linux kernel 2.6.15)</p><p>3) Wireless Range Extender/Bridge/WDS Station<br />Required functionality is similar to item 2) - WAP.</p><p>My choice here is Atheros chipset.&nbsp; And it would work well for item 2) too.</p><p>See my recommendation for item 2).</p><p>4) NAS device /shared USB printer<br />Router needs at least one USB port for this.<br />Wireless or ANT/Firewall are not required.</p><p><a href="http://www.netgear.com/products/home/wirelessrouters/high-performance/WNDR3700.aspx">WNDR3700</a> is a good choice here.<br /><a href="http://www.netgear.com/products/home/wirelessrouters/work-and-play/WNR3500L.aspx">Netgear WNR3500L</a> would work fine as well, buthas much lower price tag (about $100).</p><p>But if you need high-performance NAS functionality, you may consider buying dedicated NAS device.<br />Dedicated &quot;Print Server&quot; box is also good choice for USB printer sharing over LAN.</p><p>5) Extend wireless coverage in your area, without buying one or more AP/Routers<br />You need external detachable antennas for this.&nbsp; 2x2 MIMO or 3x3 MIMO is a plus.<br />If your router doesn&#039;t detachable antennas, you can&#039;t do it. So WNDR3700 is not an option here.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>ccdoggy wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I LOVE the distance i get out of the router, its at some points ridiculous.&nbsp; I tested it by walking outside and down the block over a bit and sat on a swing, and still has connectivity.&nbsp; a friend a block away through one of their walls was on my wireless for internet.&nbsp; This does heavily depend on the client&#039;s abilities also though.&nbsp; </p><p>Openwrt gives me hope of getting rid of this kernel panic which kills just the two wireless connections.&nbsp; but i must say again that this problem has not been reported by anyone else anywhere in dd-wrt or anywhere... frustrating.</p></blockquote></div><p>Distance you can get from router to connect at reasonable speed depends on:<br />- chipset<br />- wireless transmission power (indoor 14/outdoor 26 - typical values) of Router/AP<br />- antennas (1, 2, or 3; antenna&#039;s gain)<br /> I switched standard antenna on my ASUS WL-500G Premium for 6dBi high-gain Yagi, and result was wonderful!<br /> Old notebook with Ralink RT2500 chipset and weak antenna was able to connect to AP from kitchen. <br />- MIMO - yes/no; 2x2, 3x3, etc.<br />- chipset, antenna for wireless client(station)<br /> Atheros with external antenna would work great.</p><p>So all this depends on your budget and time you are ready to spend on deployment.<br />If notebook supports just Intel Centrino (any flavor) and you are not ready to buy ExpressCard or USB stick with Atheros chipset and External Antenna, and you have coverage problem - you need to change your router to a better one, or buy WAP/router capable to work in WDS mode or as Repeater, or upgrade antenna to a high-gain directional or omnidirectional.<br />So, not everything depends just on router itself, or its firmware. :-)</p>									</div>
