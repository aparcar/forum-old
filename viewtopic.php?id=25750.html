					<p>What exactly is a *.ipk? I know it&#039;s OpenWRT package file but what is it? I mean is it a compressed archive?</p><p>I was doing a little experimenting and renamed a random ipk file to tar.gz and viewed it with winrar. Inside the archive were 3 files:</p><p>Control.tar.gz <br />Data.tar.gz <br />debian.binary</p><p>The control.tar.gz had a text file also called control and had details such as Package name, Version, Dependencies i.e libpthread, libopenssl, libpcap and so forth.</p><p>The data.tar.gz which seemed to have all the good stuff in it. Such as the actual program.</p><p>And finally the debian.binary text file which just had the text &quot;2.0&quot; inside of it. </p><p>Ok, So assuming the ipk doesn&#039;t already exist, how do I turn my favorite linux program into a ipk?</p>									</div>

					<p>Since the ipk will most likely be installed on a different architecture, you can not convert a .deb to a .ipk. You&#039;ll need to make an OpenWrt Makefile which will download the source code, cross compile it, and then create an ipk with all the necessary information and files, much like the .deb archive. </p><p>A good place to start is by downloading the OpenWrt SVN buildroot and take a look in package/ to get a feel for how it works.</p><br /><br /><p>edit: it sounds a bit complicated, but it&#039;s actually pretty simple. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>aport</strong> on 20 Jul 2010, 01:31)</p>

I know this stuff must seem like child&#039;s play for you but literately just yesterday I learned my first linux commands such as ls, cd, and pwd.

					<p>Ok, help me out here. I&#039;m super new to this.</p><p>I have this sslsniff v0.6.tar.gz sitting on my windows desktop. I want to convert it into a ipk. and I&#039;m looking at the wiki which looks like a forgn laungage to me. </p><p>What do I do? Do I take a new text document and rename it to makefile and paste in the template I see on the wiki? Some of the things I would edit in the template are common sense but others are not. I guess I&#039;ll just read it over and over again until it make more sense.</p><p>Just need a little guidance here.

					<p>I know the below is wrong but this is how far I got. I made a folder on my win7 desktop called New folder. Inside that folder is sslstrip-0.7.tar.gz and my makefile.

PKG_MD5SUM:=How do I get the checksum if I havn&#039;t made the ipk yet?
PKG_CAT:=zcat

include $(INCLUDE_DIR)/package.mk

					<p>first of all, you need a running linux-system to use the buildsystem, you cannot do this with windows. So install linux (for beginners I would recommend ubuntu) either on your harddrive or in virtualbox or vmware. and the checksum and url is from your source-package (sslstrip-0.7.tar.gz)</p>									</div>

					<p>no, prob, I have a live CD&nbsp; I can pop in and I think I can figure how to get the checksum (which is 7fedb46e682c2d8ef3fbc52da5e002da) now that I know it&#039;s the checksum of the original tar.gz. What about the rest of the makefile? What else needs fixing?
