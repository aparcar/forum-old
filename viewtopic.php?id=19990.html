					<p>The 520gu has issues with the USB port and is unstable when using a EVDO card or phone as modem.&nbsp; Trust me, I&#039;ve tried everything I could to make it work.&nbsp; I have used a Linksys WRT350n which works okay, but you must build the image yourself as the stock images you can download don&#039;t support the LAN chipset.&nbsp; Also, I could not install kmod-usb-serial-option, which fixes the limit of USB serial devices only running at 500kb/s. There are other older Asus routers that would work, just not the newer ones that use the same CPU as the 520gu.</p><p>What ended up as my ultimate EVDO router was a small x86 board and a Dlink (Atheros) PCMCIA card.&nbsp; I use a compact flash card as the hard drive.&nbsp; Runs on 12v and less than 800ma, so it works in my car as a mobile hotspot without killing the battery.</p><p>There are some tutorials I believe floating around and are worth a look at.&nbsp; I wish I still had the links to give you but I don&#039;t.&nbsp; Google is your friend, you can find others that have done this and have really good tutorials that helped me a lot.&nbsp; Post back if you need help and I&#039;ll try to help you out.</p>									</div>
