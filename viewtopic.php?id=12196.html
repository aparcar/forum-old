					<p>Hello,</p><p>sorry if I ask a stupid question, but I seem stuck, and could not find the anwser by searching the forum.</p><p>Because of an error in squid, that TRAC (<a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/1839">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/1839</a>) claims as known and now solved, but post 7.07, I wanted to rebuild using the SVN rather than install stock 7.07. </p><p>I followed the documentation (<a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/docs/openwrt.html#x1-280002.1.1">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/d … 280002.1.1</a>) but I get stuck where it tells me to &#039;make menuconfig&#039;.&nbsp; That is, I know what this does and how it works, I did build my own kernel before, but I would simply like to use the exact same .config as normally used for the WRT54GS. And apart from that, I would also like to tell it to only build that one target, I have no need for building the other platforms.</p><p>So, question is, where do I find the .config of the stock images as they are distributed? Any help is appreciated.</p><br /><p>Oh, BTW: I also found an error in the build documentation (<a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/docs/openwrt.html#x1-280002.1.1">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/d … 280002.1.1</a>) : I am pretty sure the symlinks to the packages cannot work as instructed:</p><p>$ ln -s packages/*/* kamikaze/package/</p><p>should be</p><p>$ cd kamikaze/package/<br />$ ln -s ../../packages/*/* .</p><p>Maurits</p>									</div>
