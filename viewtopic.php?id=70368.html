					<div class="quotebox"><cite>pyed wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I solved it by replacing dropbear with openssh</p></blockquote></div><p>Ok, then the culprit really is dropbear like I guessed.</p><p>MIPS16 is disabled per package. Package Makefile can have a line &quot;PKG_USE_MIPS16:=0&quot; that disables MIPS16 code generation for that package. You might check that your dropbear Makefile has that line (package/network/services/dropbear/Makefile). The line should be there like this: <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/blob/master/package/network/services/dropbear/Makefile#L24">https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/blob â€¦ kefile#L24</a></p><p>Alternatively, you may set the config globally. Your .config has &quot;CONFIG_HAS_MIPS16=y&quot; line. That is due to the mips16 feature declaration in the target makefile. By rermoving that mips16 item from the feature list in the target Makefile, you can do a global change for all packages.</p><p>But it is not certain that mips16 is the reason for your slowness.</p><p>You might just be content with the solution of using openssh server instead.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 29 Mar 2017, 10:44)</p>
