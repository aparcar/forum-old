					<p>Hi,</p><p>does someone know, how to flash a firmware, when the firmware at the router is broken? I don&#039;t know how it happens, but after a reset the router doesn&#039;t react to anything. Only the LED&#039;s power and internet alternate blinks when i connect a network cable to it. I can not ping it at 192.168.2.1 (doesn&#039;t respond to the ARP request of the OS). It&#039;s acting only as a hub now.... Strange thing..</p><p>Any suggestions but sending it back?</p><br /><p>(Sorry for my bad english)</p>									</div>

					<p>I hope there is a better solution here; however, it sounds like the only solution is to use a JTAG cable to revive the unit.</p>									</div>
