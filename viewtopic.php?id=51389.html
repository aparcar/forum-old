					<p>Which web interface are you using and how did you install it? Did you upgrade from a previous version?</p><p>I&#039;ve seen this a few times before but never found a concrete cause for it, in a few cases it&#039;s been due to stale browser cache data, in others its been due to mismatched versions of Luci components being installed.</p>									</div>
