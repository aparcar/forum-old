					<p>Hi All,</p><p>I have a shiny new WHR-600D from Buffalo. I can see someone has committed the <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/target/linux/ramips/dts/WHR-600D.dts?rev=38550">layout</a> for the board, but I can&#039;t find a build of it anywhere. </p><p>In the supported hardware page for Buffalo, there are <em>similar</em> model numbers, but not the same, and there&#039;s a variety of chips too.</p><p>So,</p><p>- Is it possible to install OpenWRT on WHR-600D?<br />- Do I need to build the image myself based on that .dts file above?<br />- Any tips appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, so that file didn&#039;t make it into the attitude adjustment release branch - it&#039;s in the trunk. Looking at the trunk builds for ramips (<a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ramips/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ramips/</a>) there are lots in there, but not the WHR-600D. How does a model get added to the overnight builds?</p><p>I&#039;ve read the easy.build guide, but the thing I&#039;m not sure about is which config to use. How does the .dts file relate to the config file (<a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ramips/config">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ â€¦ ips/config</a>) ?</p>									</div>
