					<p>Here&#039;s a nice tip for you. I wanted to unrar the files that were downloaded from torrents with my openwrt machine and searched a bit for package/way to make package for openwrt.&nbsp; But hey, it is extremely simple...</p><p>just download this: <a href="http://www.rarsoft.com/rar/rarlinux-3.7.1.tar.gz">http://www.rarsoft.com/rar/rarlinux-3.7.1.tar.gz</a></p><p>in the archive you will find a bunch of files and one special file.. named rar_static which, i suppose is statically compiled/linked. It works perfect in openwrt. (x86)</p><p>for mipsel, i have found one while searching packages before.. i can&#039;t remember exactly where but it&#039;s there somewhere build by someone. never tested this one though.</p><p>.................<br />Extracting from ./halcyon-28days.720p-x264.r68</p><p>...&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;halcyon-28days.720p-x264.mkv<br />...............</p><p>sweeet... now i can stream everything directly from the server.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dlbogdan</strong> on 30 Apr 2008, 09:09)</p>
