					<p>Hi there! </p><p>My name is Sebastian and I&#039;m very new to custom firmware for wifi routers, and I need some help before I brick my router. I&#039;ve got a Huawei HG532 modem / router that I would like to install openwrt into in order to convert it to a repeater, so I can give wifi to a part of my house that does not reach the main modem (another HG532) Somewhere else on this forum I saw that some people could install a version of the firmware in the hg but I don&#039;t quite understand if its possible. In the wiki for the HG532 mentions that is possible to install it, but again, I&#039;m not sure on how to do it, and if it would work. </p><p>Thanks for any help, <br />Sebastian</p>									</div>
