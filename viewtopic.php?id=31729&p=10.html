					<p>Hi,<br/>I played with the config and changed the 3g modem device to /dev/ttyUSB2 and it started working fine. I assumed that all 3 devices are equal but apparently thats not true.

					<p>Hello everyone I bought a Tl-wr703n specifically to use linux with it as many here, and I need it to work as a wireless access point for a network that will set it&#039;s ip address via dhcp. I want to use it as a fileserver and music player with a usb hub and usb sound card. I found this link to a firmware <a href="http://ubuntuone.com/5FEDGTZ1GfDbgY3CzHXuwQ">http://ubuntuone.com/5FEDGTZ1GfDbgY3CzHXuwQ</a> on the forums, and was able to get it to run as specified as a router, but it had such a limited amount of free space, that I could not install kmod-fs-ext4 and block-mount for extroot without filling up the memory. I really must have restorefactory installed as i will probably end up bricking the device without it. (i know about serial, but I don&#039;t especially want to open this device right now) does anyone have a firmware that would fit me, (has necessary programs to set up AP mode wireless access point, enough space to install extroot, and restorefactory), otherwise what is the best revision of the trunk for me to build my own. my device is 1.5 if that matters.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi I have a problem with setting the baud rate on the on board serial port on a TL-WR703N (ttyATH0).</p><p>I bought the ultra low cost and compact router in china. I plan to interface a PIC 16F628 with it using serial communication@9600 8N1. Everything works great except the fact that the serial port is transmitting in 115200 instead of 9600. I guess that the main problem is that I can’t get stty to work on the device. (it’s included in the ipkg, but not the opkg that the device is using). I have searched forum for days, but most solutions seems to be for USB2serial converters (FTDI)<br/>This is the device I’m using:<br/><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr703n">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr703n</a></p><p>This is what I have done:<br/>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; installed this version of openwrt&nbsp; <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr703n-v1-squashfs-factory.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … actory.bin</a><br/>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; disabled serial console by adding “#” to /etc/inittab<br/>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; installed the following packages:<br/>a.&nbsp; &nbsp; opkg install picoterm empty<br/>b.&nbsp; &nbsp; opkg install coreutils<br/>c.&nbsp; &nbsp; opkg install microcom<br/>d.&nbsp; &nbsp; opkg install setserial<br/>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; I also manually copied stty to usr/sbin, but it does not seem to work… (<a href="http://www.jbprojects.net/projects/wifirobot/stty.tgz">http://www.jbprojects.net/projects/wifirobot/stty.tgz</a>)</p><p>I’m testing it with the following command:<br/>echo &quot;hello&quot; &gt; /dev/ttyATH0<br/>This works, I can receive the message on a pc running terminal program and hardware voltage level conversion. But it is with the wrong baud rate (still 115200).<br/>I have tried the following commands:<br/>empty -f picocom -b 9600 -p n -f n -l -r /dev/ttyATH0 -&gt; (nothing happens)<br/>empty -f picocom -b 9600 -p e -l -r /dev/ttyATH0 -&gt; (nothing happens)<br/>setserial /dev/ttyATH0 baud_base 9600 -&gt; (Cannot set serial info: Invalid argument)</p><p>If I just run setserial I get this message:<br/>root@OpenWrt:~# setserial /dev/ttyATH0 -&gt; (/dev/ttyATH0, UART: undefined, Port: 0x0000, IRQ: 11)</p><p>During boot I have seen this message:<br/>Serial: 8250/16550 driver, 1 ports, IRQ sharing disabled<br/>ar933x-uart: ttyATH0 at MMIO 0x18020000 (irq = 11) is a AR933X UART<br/>So I tried the following command:<br/>root@OpenWrt:~# setserial /dev/ttyATH0 port 0x18020000 irq 11 -&gt;(Cannot set serial info: Device or resource busy)<br/>I guess that getting a stty that works might solve the problem, but I can’t find it as a install package, and my manual install attempt didn’t work (was built for fonera kamikaze). Does anyone have any idea for how to proceed?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>konow</strong> on 9 Dec 2011, 11:14)</p>

					<p>I installed the firmware from <a href="http://www.ip6.ro/firmware/tp-link/wr703n/AP-BRIDGE_NO_WEB_INTERFACE/">http://www.ip6.ro/firmware/tp-link/wr703n/AP-BRIDGE_NO_WEB_INTERFACE/</a> thinking that i could plug in my 3g dongle and use the router as a wireless access point to access the dongles internet through wireless. It is acting as a bridge, and now i am in a situaton that i can only telnet the device in failsafe mode via an ethernet cable connected directly to my windows laptop, which has internet access via a 3g dongle. And i dont know how to give the device internet access to change firmware because i am using the ethernet port to telnet the device...Please tell me a good way to get the other luci-capable firmware on my computer to the device. I am lost:S</p>									</div>
