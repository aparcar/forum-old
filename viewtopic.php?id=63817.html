					<p>again to the point I made above, what your asking does not make any sense.. what you provided in your post is irrelevant to cross-compiling.</p><p>have a look at this, follow it step by step and if you get stuck on something post what has got you stuck and any relevant error messages and we will gladly push you along .. but to try and explain the entire process to you in a thread when you obviously have a minimal understanding of the process does no one any good. trail and error and ask well thought out and coherent questions .. that&#039;s how I learned the ropes </p><p><a href="https://manoftoday.wordpress.com/2007/10/11/writing-and-compiling-a-simple-program-for-openwrt/">https://manoftoday.wordpress.com/2007/1 â€¦ r-openwrt/</a></p>									</div>

					<p>On which system/distribution are you trying to cross-compile?</p><p>I cross-compiled OpenWrt on both Ubuntu Trusty 14.04 and Debian Jessie 8 and didn&#039;t find any problems or incompatibilities there. I just followed the wiki instructions on setting up the build environment (i.e. installing some required packages) and was good to go.</p>									</div>
