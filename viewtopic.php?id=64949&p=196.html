I don&#039;t see anything to be concerned about so far but I have a question for anyone who wants to answer: why is it loading the bluetooth modules? Does anoyone have a usb bluetooth adapter installed? And if so, what do you do with it?</p><p>Something else: I realize this build has a kernel that is more than a year more modern than the old one but I would expect that to make the .img bigger, not smaller. This experiemental .img is 15.6 MB while the norm for the older builds using the 4.9 kernel is about 16.4 MB. That is a pretty big drop in size and I&#039;m curious why that would be.</p><p>Cheers.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nick59</strong> on 3 Mar 2018, 23:48)</p>
