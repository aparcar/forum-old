					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I have had a chance to look at an early version 1.9 wr1043nd.&nbsp; I have encountered the same WAN port problem experienced by some people with recent version 1.8 models (1,2). </p><p>Just as a quick summary for those who haven&#039;t come across it, the WAN port works fine when the stock TP-Link firmware is used but stops working all together when flashed with openwrt (backfire 10.03.1 in my case).&nbsp; The theory appears to be that it is the new bootloader that is responsible for disabling the port.</p><p>The fix is quite straight forward: </p><p># if you think that a stock box might have a problem (3) then you can use the web interface to flash an older version of the firmware (4) and then proceed as usual.&nbsp; I have tried this and it works but I&#039;m afraid I can&#039;t attach the specific firmware I used.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p># if you have already flashed openwrt to the device before finding that the WAN port doesn&#039;t function, you should (I haven&#039;t tried it personally) be able to flash the older TP-Link firmware version from the openwrt shell cmd line and then proceed as usual.&nbsp; </p><br /><p>I have a couple of questions though:</p><p>for the second case, if a stock firmware with &quot;boot&quot; in the title is used, I believe that some of the binary needs to be skipped with a command such as &quot;dd if=wr1043nv1_de_3_9_17_up_boot_100331.bin of=tplink.bin skip=257 bs=512&quot;.&nbsp; I assume from the flash diagram (5) and the &quot;dd&quot; command help that this is designed to ignore the bootloader portion of the image.&nbsp; </p><p>Is this correct and, if so, how does flashing an old image have any effect on the bootloader (or the WAN port) if we skip the bootloader portion of the image?&nbsp; </p><p>Any extra info would be much appreciated as would speculation about why TP-Link might have made the change and how we might work around it in the long term without the extra firmware flash.&nbsp; </p><p>Cheers</p><br /><p>fluxfumes</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>1) <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/11898">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/11898</a><br />2) <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=34682">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=34682</a><br />3) mine came with ver 3.13.12 build 120405<br />4) ie the link from (1), <a href="http://rghost.net/36040799">http://rghost.net/36040799</a><br />5) <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd#flash.layout">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl- â€¦ ash.layout</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Wiki user kami147 posted a great grep statement to find the currently loaded bootloader revision.<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd</a></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# grep -a U-Boot /dev/mtd0ro | cut -d&#039;I&#039; -f1
U-Boot 1.1.4 (Nov 17 2009 - 11:56:26)</code></pre></div><p>I&#039;m not sure of the exact hardware revision, but I have no issue with the above U-boot (found in firmware wr1043nv1_en_3_9_17_up_boot(091118).bin) using Backfire (10.03.1, r29685).</p><p>As for your question of moving to an older bootloader from a working OpenWrt install; I believe the procedure of removing U-Boot from a factory image was done for safety purposes. It is possible (as per the Wiki) to upgrade/downgrade U-Boot from the OpenWrt CLI, but is perhaps considered dangerous since we lack JTAG. Whoever whote that probably preferred using the TP-Link scripts to update the bootloader from the factory GUI.</p><p>I personally wouldn&#039;t want to downgrade to an older bootloader in the off chance that there are actual hardware changes on the board. Just give it some time and I&#039;m sure juhosg will find a method of initializing the switch properly across all versions of U-Boot. It sure would be nice to know what version of U-Boot he is using to test with though.</p>									</div>
