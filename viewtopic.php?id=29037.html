					<p>I just bought device but there doesn&#039;t seem to be any hardware info about it on the OpenWRT wiki so I created it:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr940n">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr940n</a></p><p>It looks like the WR940Nv1 is a WR941NDv4 with fixed antennas, which in turn is similar to the WR741ND.</p><p>Anyway, it seems to boot fine but I haven&#039;t started doing anything with it yet.</p><p>/Simon</p>									</div>

					<p>If you have a TP-LINK router that seems to be cooked, but you can still ping it you should be ok and recovery is easier then you think.</p><p>This works perfectly for the TL-WR1043ND, and from what I can gather it just may save you on the WR940N as well. </p><p>1. unplug the power<br />2. Plug the power back in<br />3. Wait until the SYS light blinks then HOLD DOWN the QSS button<br />4. wait until you see the SYS LED flash VERY quickly then you can let go of the QSS button. you are now in recovery mode</p><p>you should now be able to Telnet or TFTP into the router via 192.168.1.1</p><p>If you are unfamiliar with that procedure you can try</p><p>1. make sure your LAN adapter in your PC is set to 192.168.1.2 for IP and 192.168.1.1 for GATEWAY<br />2. plug in VIA LAN cable to a LAN port on the back of the router<br />3. now open up a command window and use TELNET or any other TELNET or TFTP application (easiest on XP, on vista and win 7 you will hve to install Telenet)<br />4. In the command window type&nbsp; &nbsp; telnet 192.168.1.1&nbsp; &nbsp; You should now see the login (NO USER OR PASSWORD REQUIRED)<br />5. at the command window you can now perform any action via command line. I normally wipe it back to OpenWrt defaults and that should get you back to square one.<br />6. The command line to reset everything to default is&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mtd -r erase rootfs_data</p><p>Good luck and let me know how you make out!</p>									</div>
