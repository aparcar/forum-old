					<p>I would like to accept/deny traffic from a host but based on a fully qualified domain name. How is that possible?</p><p>For example i have a nodogsplash hotspot but i would like to allow users access to facebook. Since facebook uses multiple cdns it would be best if i could put a firewall rule to allow all domains *.fbcdn.net and *.facebook.com without having a full list of ip range of akamai and facebook.</p>									</div>
