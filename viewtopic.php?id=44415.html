					<p>Hi,</p><p>i want my OpenWRT to </p><p>- open his own Wifi &quot;OpenWrt&quot; AND<br />- connect to a certain WiFi which you can choose via web interface (e.g. hotel hotspot).</p><p>The traffic via the own wifi should be routed through the second wifi, so that there is only one external IP adress.</p><p>What i did so far:<br />1. installed openwrt <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />2. installed luci<br />3. installed relayd and luci-proto-relay<br />4. set up wlan interface to &quot;access point&quot;, master, (interface wlan), static IP (192.168.30.1), dhcp on<br />5. set up wlan interface to &quot;client&quot;, interface: wlanclient<br />6. created a interface &quot;relay bridge&quot; between &quot;wlan&quot; and &quot;wlanclient&quot;<br />7. set the firewall to accept forwarding.</p><p>But: still does not work. however, the openwrt always seems to lose his static route.<br />my clients connect to openwrt and receive ip adress from dhcp. they can connect to luci. but no connection to the internet.</p><p>any hints?</p><p>and, if i get this to work - is there a possibility to chance the &quot;client&quot; side to another SSID without having to reprogram all static routes etc?</p><p>thank you <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
