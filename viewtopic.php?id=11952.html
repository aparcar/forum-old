					<p>If you&#039;re familiar with the *nix shell, then the stock versions of OpenWRT should do fine. There is WhiteRussian, which is labeled &#039;stable&#039;, but works with its settings in NVRAM, and there is the development version named &#039;Kamikaze&#039;, which is more rough around the edges, but stores its settings in real config files. I find the latter to be easier - a lot. </p><p>If you prefer GUI-based setup, you can get x-wrt images of both versions (WhiteRussian + Kamikaze) from the <a href="http://x-wrt.org/">X-wrt homepage</a>.</p><p>After trying out both (and fiddling and messing up a bit), I went with Kamikaze, and installed X-wrt on top of it (I do most, if not all, of the configuration through SSH, but X-wrt is still nice to display stuff, and it works to some extent on Kamikaze, albeit not as good as on WhiteRussian).</p><p>Both OpenWRT versions provide the stuff you are looking for, so it&#039;s up to you to decide. WhiteRussian is better documented than Kamikaze, though, keep that in mind <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi All,</p><p>My recommendation would be White Russian RC6. As the Borromini said it is documented nicely. I started to use it almost with none Linux knowledge and it helped to learn a lot. Right now im able to use: torrent, storage, swap, WPA2+AES and I had separated LAN from WLAN. </p><p>But most of the time I use command line for configuring. I only use web interface for listing avaliable packages.</p><p>Greetings,</p><p>Bart</p>									</div>

					<p>You can install Whiterussian 0.9 and it has a interface (built in) that will allow you to configure all of those options quite simply. It&#039;s very stable and reliable. You won&#039;t have to use a unix prompt or handle and interface any harder than the stock Linksys kind. Also if you want you would be able to install XWRT which is a secondary interface which is a little better than default, but that&#039;s only optional considering the limited functions you&#039;re looking for.</p><p>A note: You may want to use WPA encryption instead of WEP.</p>									</div>

					<p>I firmly recommend using WPA(2) too, if some of your devices does not support it, consider upgrading (unless it is a Wii or something, I don&#039;t know why the heck Nintendo decided to make it do WEP only).</p>									</div>

					<p>Khazar,</p><p>Not that RC6 is bad, but the <em>vast</em> majority of the documentation for WR RC6 also applies to WR 0.9.&nbsp; Also, I&#039;m not sure if RC6 is still officially &quot;supported.&quot;</p>									</div>

					<p>If all your devices can use WPA, I think it is much easier to administer than WEP. As I understand WEP, the network key is an easily messed up string of numbers.&nbsp; With WPA, I pick a network key that is easy for me to remember and maintain; I can use a text string or phrase like any secure password, only I can use more characters than most passwords.&nbsp; Plus, since I can pick something readable rather than a bunch of numeric jibberish like in WEP, it is easier for me to see if I have made a mistake when entering it.</p>									</div>
