					<p>So I have two buffalo whr-g54s routers that I upgraded from white russian to kamikaze via the web interface.&nbsp; Now they don&#039;t seem to load completely.&nbsp; I can ping their ip addresses and successfully tftp new images to them, but they never seem to fully boot.&nbsp; I can&#039;t access them via telnet, ssh or the web interface.&nbsp; Did I brick these guys?</p>									</div>

					<p>If you can ping them and you can reflash them then they are not bricked. I don&#039;t know what the problem is though. If you can&#039;t figure it out reflash them with white russian.</p>									</div>

					<p>I can successfully tftp kamikaze, white russian and I even tried dd-wrt.&nbsp; They all transfer without error.&nbsp; I can always ping the default ip.&nbsp; But I can&#039;t telnet, ssh or browse to it via web.&nbsp; It&#039;s like the images are getting transferred, but not loading.&nbsp; Is there any way I can take them back to factory defaults and try again?&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried holding the init button for more than 30 seconds and letting it come back up, but I still get the same behaviour.&nbsp; TFTP looks good, but never seems to fully load....</p>									</div>
