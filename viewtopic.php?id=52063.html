					<p>Hi all,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; We use the SW version and development environment as follows:<br />Development Environment: OpenWrt trunk version <br />Linux Wireless: compat-wireless-2014-05-22(ath9k, mac80211, cfg80211, nl80211)<br />SOC: Atheros AR9344 chip</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Currently, our product is testing AP 20/40 MHz Coexistence for WiFi certification, and this test can not pass it. We want to know whether Linux wireless of OpenWrt trunk version can not support this feature or not? Whether you could tell us which OpenWrt version support 20/40 MHz Coexistence or not? It is highly urgent for us to test 20/40 MHz Coexistence. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So far, we only can not pass this feature(20/40 MHz Coexistence), and other feature has been passed it for WiFi certification. Hoping sincerely that you can give us to a reply.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks,</p>									</div>

					<p>Hostapd handles all that. At least it won&#039;t let you start HT40 access point operation if other wifi networks would occupy overlapping channels. You should ask on the hostapd mailing list if you need details.</p>									</div>
