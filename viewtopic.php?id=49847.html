It worked althought the interface shows &quot;unknown&quot; (corectly deteced via the serial console). I even managed to connect it and its working. Actualy there&#039;re a lot of &quot;goodies&quot; for the good old Wrap. I made it show the cpu temp with &quot;sensors&quot; command. <br />You&#039;re right about restarting. Mine also refused to restart. It says &quot;machine restart&quot;, but nothing hapens. </p><p>BTW: My goal is to start airmon-ng on that board (so far without success - it starts the airmon software but there&#039;s no output on the serial console), have you ever tried this?</p>									</div>

In that scenario I can flash your firmware directly on the wr740n, instead of byuing a new one.</p>									</div>
