					<p>Hi guys,&nbsp; &nbsp;I have a WRT54GL v1.1 running Tomato 1.21 and want to attempt a ram mod to increase my connections potential.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would be happy with a 32mb upgrade but guess 64mb would be even better.<br />I&#039;ve read another thread on this board and conclude that I should get either of the following 3 chips</p><p>Hynix&nbsp; HY5DU56822DT-D43<br />Nanya&nbsp; NT5DS32M16BS-5T<br />Micron MT46V32M16TG-6T</p><p>My questions are:<br />1) Are the above chips correct?<br />2) once I solder the chip to the board, it will read 32mb.&nbsp; Do I telnet connect, then input the following commands to detect the full 64mb or is there more commands?</p><p>nvram set sdram_ncdl=0x000000<br />nvram commit</p><p>3) Once I get the ram upgraded, are the settings written to ROM or do I need to commit the new commands evertime I clear NVRAM for Tomato upgrades?</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>									</div>
