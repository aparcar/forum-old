					<p>seems like <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/19570">here is</a> your problem<br />heavily recommend you to finally get a serial connection to unbrick first two devices</p><p>try to flash breed u-boot, compatible with wt3020 board<br /><a href="https://app.box.com/s/4hecy7shljzuokj1lenf">https://app.box.com/s/4hecy7shljzuokj1lenf</a></p><p>the link above points to translated breed image (original one is fully chinese and lives here - <a href="http://breed.hackpascal.net/)">http://breed.hackpascal.net/)</a><br />it provides web interface and dhcp in the recovery mode, also itll be easy to flash your router via breed web instead of serial+tftp mode.<br />If your third device is still alive, you can test it first on it. To flash breed try to telnet to your stock firmware<br />username: nexxadmin<br />password: y1n2inc.com0755</p><p>put breed image to the flash drive and insert it, then<br /># cd /media/sda/sda1<br /># mtd_write write u-boot-nexx-3020-7620.bin mtd0</p><p>u&#039;ll see</p><p>Unlocking mtd0…<br />Writing from u-boot-nexx-3020-7620.bin to mtd0… [w]</p><p>and after device will reboot</p><p>to enter recovery mode just press reset button before powering it up and hold it for ~5 seconds<br />after entering recovery mode your pc will get ip address from dhcp and web iface will be ready at 192.168.1.1</p><p>here what breed is looks like <a href="http://img.mysku-st.ru/uploads/images/01/87/22/2014/12/03/575b33.png">http://img.mysku-st.ru/uploads/images/0 … 575b33.png</a></p><p>BUT<br />be careful, mistakes made while flashing u-boot can be solved only by unsoldering and reprogramming</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stas2z</strong> on 20 Dec 2015, 21:53)</p>
