					<p>I bought this router a couple of months ago in the hopes to feed a house with many wireless devices, but things changed. I ended up keeping it for future use. I recently moved into an apartment that has Gigabit FTTP service through Centurylink, which uses PPPoE, a Vlan tag of 201 and the MTU set at 1492.</p><p>I was able to get this router working for those requirements by flashing it with OpenWRT Barrier breaker 14.07<br />I finally got it working on the fiber connection today but I seem to have encountered an issue with wan performance.</p><p>This is what I get when using the centurylink Technicolor C2000T router:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://puu.sh/hYkyD/d209a8625d.png" alt="http://puu.sh/hYkyD/d209a8625d.png" /></span><br />And this is what I get when using the TP-Link with openWRT (mtu set to 1492):<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://puu.sh/hYkqK/d8bab76efe.png" alt="http://puu.sh/hYkqK/d8bab76efe.png" /></span></p><p>I found a few older topics on these forums of people having similar issues (though I didnt see any from people using a gigabit WAN connection). Is this some kind of limitation of how OpenWRT operates?<br />Is there something i can change to fix this (so i dont have to rent/buy the CL router)?<br />or do I need to stick with the CL router or buy a business class router that has configurable VLAN settings from the factory?</p><p>any help would be greatly appreciated, Thanks.<br />-Nemesis</p>									</div>

					<p>openwrt won&#039;t support hw accelerated nat, so you won&#039;t get gigabit wan speeds:</p><p><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/11779">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/11779</a></p><p>you could MAYBE use a cheap gigabit router as wr1043nd (with openwrt) just for doing the vlan tagging, using the C7 with tplink firmware for NAT.</p><p>I&#039;m totally unsure of the performance you could get.</p>									</div>

					<p>I see, that was what I was reading in the older posts i mentioned. I guess I could try going back to the stock FW and see if it works with CL removing the VLAN tag requirement. otherwise I guess Im stuck with their router. Thank you.</p>									</div>
