The router has been up for over two days with no issue except some warning in system log.

I have Logictech squeezebox radio and it connected with the 2.4G radio with no issue with r5113 firmware. The same device won&#039;t hold connection with 3200 with DDWRT or older LEDE firmware.<br />I installed LEDE from Linksys firmware; then restored configuration from previous LEDE archive.</p>									</div>
