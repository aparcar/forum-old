					<p>I tried it but the issue remains. the 5ghz led is on and it seems as though the network is enabled but signal is 0%, tx/rx is 0 etc.<br />as for the firmware i cant really remember anymore. you think i might be better off with dd-wrt? or where could i find the newest fw with gui? sorry, im quite new to this, and the info i find about this topic in general is so overwhelming and half of it i cant even understand.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jzakarias</strong> on 4 Mar 2015, 00:00)</p>
