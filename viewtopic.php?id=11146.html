					<p>I want access to a serial console on a Linksys wrt54gl from a PC. From What I read using a usb phone data cable is the easiest solution.<br />I&#039;m thinking of buying a Nokia DKU-5 cable since I&#039;ve seen other users having success using that cable.<br />Assuming I cut of the phone connector and identify vcc, rx, tx and gnd, and get them connected to the router, how do I proceed from there? Does the OS need a special driver and if so what driver would that be? (Linux or Windows, I have both). I assume after maybe installing a driver I would just use a terminal program to access the console the same way I would if i was connecting through a normal serial port.</p><p>/Mikkel</p>									</div>

					<p>Windows will be able to find the driver for the chip in the USB end.&nbsp; Linux should have it already.</p><p>I believe all you will need is RX, TX, and GND.&nbsp; The chip should be powered from the USB port not the WRT if I understand correctly.</p><p>I prefer using the very similar (and slightly less hacky) setup outlined in section 3.1.2 of this document:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WRTSL54GS">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har â€¦ /WRTSL54GS</a></p><p>In Windows it shows up as a COM port, in Linux as /dev/ttyUSB0.&nbsp; Nice part is for me you can have multiple.&nbsp; I am wiring up a closet at a WISP now so that I have 3 of these cables running to 3 WRT units from a Linux PC so that I have consoles to all of them.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 12 Jun 2007, 18:54)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the pointers. It looks appealing. It will probably cost a little more but on the other hand you can just solder a $1 jack plug in another router and use the same cable if you don&#039;t need concurrent access. All in all it seems like the better solution. <br />Thanks again.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yep that&#039;s my motivation. I equip every router that passes through my hands with that simple stereo jack now.&nbsp; I keep a USB cable in my laptop bag. Problem with a WRT? No trouble to jack in and fire up HyperTerminal.</p>									</div>
