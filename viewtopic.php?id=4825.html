					<p>Hello,<br /> I&#039;ve recently read <a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2006/086">http://eprint.iacr.org/2006/086</a> which discusses<br />/dev/random of linux. It also says that because of the hardware openwrt<br />runs the randomness gathered is really few and not to be trusted (for ssh<br />or anything). They suggest saving the randomness state across reboots<br />and add other ways to gather randomness. Has this issue been discussed<br />before? Do you know whether there are openwrt platforms where the kernel<br />cannot really fill its random pool?</p><p>regards,<br />Nikos</p>									</div>

					<p>I was thinking of the following scripts to save the random states across reboots (since openwrt doesn&#039;t shutdown explicitly the normal /etc/init.d/urandom from a debian would not work). The idea is to have a normal initialization of /dev/urandom from a saved file and update the file immediately with the output of /dev/urandom. Then initiate a daemon that will read every now and then /dev/urandom and update the saved file. What do you think?</p><p>/etc/init.d/S11urandom:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#! /bin/sh

AD-conversion noise plus receiver noise could be an entropy source (at least at low RSSI levels).</p><p>A random input based on RF should probably be considered rather critical as &quot;physical access&quot; might be just another WLAN router standing nearby. </p><p>Also using the RSSI only addresses a small aspect of the paper you cited so being able to optionally use a script like yours would be a good idea!</p>									</div>
