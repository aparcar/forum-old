					<p>I just received a nice new WNR100 v2 and I&#039;ve opened it up to find:</p><p>* a cpu covered by a heat sink<br />* 256Mb ram chip (32MB)<br />* Atheros ar9285-AL1A wi fi chip<br />* no byte wide flash<br />* a serial flash chip - 25L3205DM2I-12G (32Mb or 4MB)</p><p>I also found the <a href="http://kb.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2649">Netgear Open source software</a> page.

					<p>No, as we don&#039;t have access to the board. The cpu should be an AR7240, so if you decide to add support for it, use the ar71xx target as a base.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m thinking that if you just change the value in the file /module_name from WNR1000v2-VC to WNR1000v2 (or maybe WNR1000v2-NA) you should be able to get past the module name check and just use the firmware update page to upload WNR1000v2-V1.0.1.1NA.img</p><p>Unfortunately the squashfs filesystem on /dev/root is marked read-only and it&#039;s not a symbolic link to a writable file. I haven&#039;t been able to figure out how to use mtd to temporarily mark the filesystem read-write so that I can change the /module_name using cat. If anyone can explicitly spell out how this might be done, it would be very helpful.</p><p>My next step is to compile the 1.0.1.1 firmware but change its module name check to WNR1000v2-VC so that it uploads correctly.</p>									</div>

					<p>while looking things over earlier today, i noticed that the GPL firmware src on the netgear site has very few almost miniscule differences between the WNR1000v2-VC and the WNR1000v2. Most of which can probably be contributed to the software version differences.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(downloaded both and looked through everything with winmerge) </p><p>The most notable difference is the addition of some files in the VC version, mainly custom configs, and patch files, and more importantly, the declaration of the module version / name in the makefile.. (I&#039;m sure if i dig a little further, can figure out where and how to disable the rejection of non-VC firmware, doing this once, should allow us to flash a different version) <br />an easier example to get the latest netgear firmware for the WNR1000v2 on the VC version would be to download the GPL source for the normal v2, and simply tack on the &quot; -VC &quot; at the end of the module name declaration line here:<br />line#: 9<br />File Location:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>WNR1000v2_V1.0.1.1_gpl_src/target/linux/wnr1000v2-2.6/image/Makefile</code></pre></div><p>by doing so, you should be able to flash the device with normal WNR1000v2 firmware, and forgo the outdated VC version that doesn&#039;t seem to be actively developed anywhere.</p><p>now i haven&#039;t tried this as of yet, but worst case scenario, you&#039;de have to send the router back to comcast as non-functional. If i remember right, i read somewhere that they will provide postage to ship it back.. or you could go to your local office and say &quot; it stopped working, can i get an exchange &quot;</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ArcAIN6</strong> on 27 Sep 2010, 07:55)</p>

					<p>I have acquired the WNR1000v2-VC V1.0.0.3NA firmware that can be used for recovery of these particular routers which were provided by Comcast. I attempted building the firmware in different Linux environments according to the instructions included with the GPL source code and it ended prematurely with GCC errors. After 3 weeks and 3 tiers of support, I received the firmware from Netgear. It took an &quot;engineer&quot; to provide me with the firmware which none of technical support could provide. This was the most horrible technical support provided by a company that I&#039;ve ever experienced, especially for such a simple request of wanting the firmware for THEIR GPL source code.</p><p>I uploaded the firmware image at the DD-WRT forums.

Hence, the added -VC to the model number. I know this because I was able to modify the header of the firmware image for V1.0.1.1 for upload to the router and it detected a corrupt kernel. According to NETGEAR technical support, the router hardware for the WNR1000v2-VC and WNR1000v2 are identical. So, if anyone has the U-Boot boot-loader for the WNR1000v2, then could you share it or retrieve a copy from your router? Also, once I have the U-Boot image then is there a way to change the boot-loader, other than JTAG? I don&#039;t believe this unit has the interface.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>computer.technician</strong> on 29 Nov 2010, 07:02)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m sorry to bring up what appears to be a dead thread, but I&#039;ve been trying to get OpenWRT on this router and I&#039;ve made some progress I wanted to share. So first of all, I have the WNR1000v2-VC version that was handed out by comcast. I&#039;m not sure what the differences are between the VC and normal version. Someone above me mentioned something about not being able to upgrade the firmware, but I downloaded v1.0.0.12 from netgear&#039;s site and was able to update to it. In any case, what I really want is OpenWRT running on this router. Towards that end, I&#039;ve actually made some progress, and I have a WNR1000v2-VC-OpenWRT.img file you can upload through the router&#039;s web interface. It boots the OpenWRT kernel but right now I&#039;m stuck trying to determine the correct boot arguments. But before I get to that part, let me tell you guys how to build the image file yourselves.</p><p>First, download and extract the GPL sources from netgear;s gpl source site. I used this toolchain <a href="http://www.downloads.netgear.com/files/GPL/WNR1000v2-VC_V1.0.0.3_gpl_src.zip.">http://www.downloads.netgear.com/files/ â€¦ l_src.zip.</a> Now, I wasn&#039;t actually able to compile any kind of firmware with this toolchain, but that&#039;s not why we need it. The important parts are the programs in the &#039;tools&#039; directory. Follow the build directions in the toolchain and make changes as needed (I had to make several, and unfortunately I didn&#039;t document some of them) until the mkimage and mksquashfs-lzma programs are built. That&#039;s all you need from this toolchain.</p><p>Next, checkout the latest OpenWRT attitude_adjustment toolchain from subversion. I configured the toolchain using the console based menu, but for brevity here&#039;s a tinypaste link to the configuration file I used <a href="http://tny.cz/04cc1b8b">http://tny.cz/04cc1b8b</a>. Go ahead and build the images using &quot;make&quot;. Now what we have to do is use the filesystem tools from netgear&#039;s toolchain to assemble an image containing the kernel and rootfs created by the OpenWRT toolchain. Here&#039;s a script I wrote to accomplish this. Make sure to update the NETGEAR and OPENWRT variables to point to the respective SDKs.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/bash

I&#039;m not sure if there&#039;s a way to auto-detect it, but I got that address from the output of the &#039;readelf -a vmlinux.elf&#039; command. Once you run this script, you should have a file &#039;WNR1000v2-VC-OpenWRT.img&#039;. You can upload that through the router&#039;s firmware upgrade page.</p><p>Now here&#039;s the part I&#039;m stuck on. The kernel boots but can&#039;t find the the root partition. Here&#039;s a tinypaste link to my boot log <a href="http://tny.cz/3e8f1d20">http://tny.cz/3e8f1d20</a>. Obviously, the boot arguments that worked for the netgear firmware aren&#039;t working for OpenWRT. I&#039;ve tried to omit the root and rootfstype options hoping for some kind of auto-detect, but I get the same error (with block (0,0)). I&#039;ve also tried guessing several variations, and no luck there either. Guys, we&#039;re like one step away from running OpenWRT on this router, and I could use your help.</p><p>Does anyone have any idea how we can find out the proper boot arguments to use? Also, if there&#039;s an OpenWRT developer reading this, I&#039;d like to eventually update the OpenWRT image builder to make proper images for this board (hopefully without the outdated utilities from the netgear dsk), but I don&#039;t know how to go about doing that. Help!?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ctrlc-root</strong> on 5 Mar 2013, 03:54)</p>

					<p>Ok, well I&#039;ve done some digging, and it seems there&#039;s more work to do than I first though. We need to add support for a new device following <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/add.new.device">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/add.new.device</a>. My only gripe is that the page seems to be somewhat out of date. I picked the latest support revision I could find in subversion (<a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset?sfp_email=&amp;sfph_mail=&amp;reponame=&amp;old=35840%40trunk%2Ftarget%2Flinux%2Far71xx&amp;new=35789%40trunk%2Ftarget%2Flinux%2Far71xx&amp;sfp_email=&amp;sfph_mail=">https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset?sfp_e â€¦ sfph_mail=</a>) and I&#039;ll be working off that to try and add support for this board. I&#039;ve extracted some information about the router from uboot, namely the flash layout, so I&#039;ll start working to add support to the openwrt build system for this board. My first goal is to get the kernel to boot. Then I&#039;ll worry about all the nice hardware like ethernet interfaces, leds, and other things. Lastly, we&#039;ll have to add support for building firmware images for these kinds of boards. I&#039;ve subscribed myself to this topic, so if anyone with development experience (in particular with this not-so-fully-documented-openwrt sdk), I would appreciate the help.</p><p>Here&#039;s some of my notes on the board&#039;s flash layout <a href="http://tny.cz/59e75343">http://tny.cz/59e75343</a> and a work-in-progress mach file <a href="http://tny.cz/8d5d8064">http://tny.cz/8d5d8064</a>. Hopefully, this thread won&#039;t die again until we&#039;ve added hardware support for this board <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p>									</div>
