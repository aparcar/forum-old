					<p>I&#039;ve been looking for the same thing, but didn&#039;t have any luck either. I finally downloaded the image builder, but haven&#039;t had a chance to work on it.<br />I still need to do some research to find what are the essential packages, but I know I don&#039;t want luci on it. I want to have openvpn on the squashfs.<br />Let me know what packages you need and what size are you looking for. I can probably build you one if mine works. My router has 4MB, so I&#039;ll try to fit as many packages as I can. I&#039;ll try to work on it next weekend, but I can&#039;t promise anything.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you have only 4MiB Flash and want to &quot;fit as many packages&quot; as you can, you should generate your own image.</p><p>If you then want brcm-2.4 and new packages, you may even need to compile stuff yourself.</p><p>You really want this proprietary stuff? Broadcom people themselves offer FOSS drivers for their hardware.

					<p>Hi Any luck with this?<br />Thanks for the help but I actually bricked my router so if i get it fixed please can you post your image.<br />I&#039;m looking for cifs, cifs mount, mpd, mpc usb and audio. Isnt it best to make an absolute minimum image and then add the needed packages afterwards?<br />The other option is to use a usb hub with a flash drive for mpd which is the biggest component i need.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the tips Orca. Well, I tried image builder. I built the images so that they would not have any luci packages because I thought that would free up more space for other packages, but that&#039;s not what happens. The generated images were 2.6MB, which is bigger than the one for download in the openwrt website (about 2.4MB for a wrt54g). I don&#039;t know if I did something wrong or that&#039;s just how it works. The command I used was: make image PROFILE=Broadcom-b43 PACKAGES=&quot;-luci* -ppp -ppp-mod-pppoe&quot;. During the building it showed the packages being installed and there was no luci. I also built another with openvpn, and it was 3.2MB. I&#039;m thinking we are gonna need a different method to make it smaller. If you (boozelclark) still want me to build you an image that is this big, let me know. I looked into the packages you want and I could not find these packages: cifs, audio, usb, but for usb I found usb-modeswitch, usb-modeswitch-data, usbutils.</p>									</div>

					<p>boozleclark is probably talking about kmod-usb-core, and perhaps kmod-usb-audio and kmod-fs-cifs.</p><p>On a Windows PC, there are a number of options for installing linux so that you can build the openWrt system you want.</p><p>You can also install Linux (Ubuntu, for instance) alongside Windows to create a dual-boot PC.</p><p>What device are you installing to?&nbsp; Is there a reason why you cannot flash a precompiled openWrt and then install the packages you need?</p>									</div>
