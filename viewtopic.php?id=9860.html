					<p>Hi,</p><p>I wonder if a Linksys WRT54GL (200 MHz, 4 MB Flash, 16 MB RAM) with OpenWrt can be used as a gateway for a small enterprise with about 30 users and a dedicated server that does webserver and mail tasks? The connection to the Internet is 100Mbit... I wonder since I guess that the purpose is rather for the home use...</p><p>Or I could use another router that has better specs.</p><br /><p>mcoe</p>									</div>

					<p>I would recommend looking at a low power (if that is what you are looking for) x86 box with some distribution of linux on it. I have used clarkconnect myself for such a purpose but you could use debian or centos or whatever distro you like.</p>									</div>
