					<p>I have an OpenWRT based router that was recently infected with Linkbucks malware, it uses an iptables PREROUTING rules to create malicious redirects to <a href="http://159.203.81.47/ga.js">this</a> malicious javascript file. This particular router didn&#039;t have a strong password on it so that may have been how the attacker got in, my guess is that this attack is not specific to OpenWRT routers as it doesn&#039;t manipulate any uci config files but instead just adds an iptables rule. Rebooting the router removed the malicious PREROUTING rule(I also reset it and added a strong password as well to be safe).</p><p>This is the malicious PREROUTING rule being used:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Chain PREROUTING (policy ACCEPT)

					<p>I&#039;ve seen reports online of this attack but no exact details on how exactly it was carried out, most posts online just said to reset your router and made it out to be a DNS based attack, since it&#039;s not persistent across reboots it&#039;s hard to investigate unless you know what you are looking for, since I had ruled out DNS or local computer compromise fairly quickly I figured it would be in iptables as basically every linux based router uses iptables. This was just a test router of mine so I was able to quickly isolate the issue to this particular router since I had another working network segment(I have multiple public WAN IP&#039;s).</p>									</div>
