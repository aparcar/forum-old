					<p>I guess your WLAN + LAN network is in the range 192.168.0.0/24, and thus any computer connected to the WLAN gets an IP address in that range; then, attaching your LANVOIP to the same WLAN does not work, because computers in that network are in a different range. It is like putting two groups of people in the same room, each group speaking one different language.</p><p>What you want is to set up three separate networks:</p><p>- WAN, to connect to to the internet.<br />- LAN + WAN, for your local network.<br />- VOIPLAN, for the VOIP clients.</p><p>Now you want to route (using masquerading) packages from the LAN + WAN to the WAN (I guess this is already working for you), and also route (not bridge) packages from your LAN + WAN to your VOIPLAN. Thus, VOIPLAN must not be attached to WAN; you must use your &quot;firewall&quot; configuration to route packages between LAN + WAN to VOIPLAN (sorry, but I have never used AA, and cannot go into details here).</p>									</div>

					<p>I think you just don&#039;t understand what I want. All what I want is <strong>explanation why and how one could attach two networks to wireless one</strong>. It is <strong>possible</strong> through OpenWRT web interface (see screenshot above) and can be done through directive <strong>option network &#039;lan1 lan2&#039;</strong> in wireless setup.</p><p>There is no such configuration as ip adresses range in wireless setup. You can only set abstract &#039;network&#039; by &#039;option network&#039; directive.</p><p>Thank you anyway.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ulrith</strong> on 12 Jan 2015, 16:05)</p>

					<p>I have the impression that you have already attached two networks to a wireless network, but it does not do what you want it to do; so I tried to understand what is the final picture of what you want to achieve, and try to help you make it possible.</p><p>Your WLAN + LAN network is configured as 192.168.0.0/24 (that is what the &quot;config interface &#039;lan&#039;&quot; says in your other post), and your VOIPLAN is configured as 192.168.1.0/24 (your own words on the other post). Computers in one range are not going to &quot;see&quot; computers on the other range if you attach/bridge both networks, you need to route them.</p>									</div>

					<p>So, if route will be properly configured, you CAN attach different networks to one wireless device, right?</p><p>Regarding </p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Your WLAN + LAN network is configured as 192.168.0.0/24</p></blockquote></div><p> - how do you know this from configs?</p><p>There is clear information that <strong>LAN</strong> network is configured as 192.168.0.0/24 and that wireless somehow connected to both LAN and LANVOIP - they look equal in wireless config. (Probably if I change an order - like that: <em>option network &#039;lanvoip lan&#039;</em> - WLAN will connect to 192.168.1.0/24?)</p><p>Anyway this option to connect several &#039;networks&#039; to wireless interface looks unclear to me...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ulrith</strong> on 12 Jan 2015, 17:35)</p>

					<p>What is the point of separating the VOIP network, if a rogue wifi client can just use DHCP to &quot;jump the fence&quot;...?</p><p>Go to your wifi configuration, add a new network on radio0 (call it &quot;VOIPWLAN&quot;, for example), and give it a different SSID than the SSID used for the WLAN. Now bridge that VOIPWLAN interface to the VOIPLAN (in other words, &quot;attach VOIPLAN to VOIPWLAN&quot;), and use VOIPWLAN for your wifi-enabled VoIP devices. You could even use DHCP (in the 192.168.1.0/24 range) on that network, and forget about static IPs.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t like the idea to have two ssids and select to which of them I should connect.
