					<p>Actually ALWAYS make sure you have a fixed static LAN IP on the HooToo, and DO NOT rely on the primary router to assign this, even statically based upon MAC.&nbsp; If you need to access your device off the LAN for service, it will not have an IP and appear inaccessible.</p><p>I agree with mmmdonuts on the printer too.</p>									</div>

Also, a certain package required for samba service would be missing. like he said on page one, do not try and upgrade with the systemgrade.bin.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi all! I need some help here. I have an HT-TM02 that was not working properly and was totally smashed during flash update, so factory flashing is no longer available. I got the serial console soldered and I can access it through putty but I am having trouble setting the tftp server.<br />When the router is booted I press I in order to access the menu, than I need z to access the prompt, but I seem unable to go any further. I have a flood of &quot;ArpTimeoutCheck&quot; each time I try tftp... any hint?</p>									</div>
