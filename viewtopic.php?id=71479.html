					<p>Hello dear community - sure this has been covered before but it was intensely difficult to find, and since I got help via email from Matthias Schiffer regarding this solution, I decided to post it publicly.</p><p>TP-Link, as BrainSlayer points out in post viewtopic.php?id=63123 in the forum, has a verification, of sorts, that results in the dreaded 18005 error when flashing from stock to openwrt or LEDE. </p><p>One fix was to add a USB with a script, and have it run via modification of the WIFI SSID (too complicated but actually rather brilliant), </p><p>Another fix, rather time consuming, was to flash dd-wrt (with the region fix incorporated), flash back to stock (pre-region-code-validation), and then flash OpenWRT.</p><p>And this new Fix, which is actually here &gt; </p><p>git lede-project org/?p=lede/neoraider/staging.git;a=commitdiff;h=72fd20205fe26b434b6a292926ccc569c6b1ce0c</p><p>Which all it does is add this line:</p><p>IMAGE/factory.bin := append-rootfs | mktplinkfw factory -C US</p><p>right before &quot;endef&quot; inside target/linux/ar71xx/image/tp-link.mk</p><p>Example Before for TL-WR710N:</p><p>define Device/tl-wr710n-v1<br />&nbsp; $(Device/tplink-8mlzma)<br />&nbsp; DEVICE_TITLE := TP-LINK TL-WR710N v1<br />&nbsp; DEVICE_PACKAGES := kmod-usb-core kmod-usb2<br />&nbsp; BOARDNAME := TL-WR710N<br />&nbsp; DEVICE_PROFILE := TLWR710<br />&nbsp; TPLINK_HWID := 0x07100001<br />&nbsp; CONSOLE := ttyATH0,115200<br />endef</p><br /><p>Example After:</p><p>define Device/tl-wr710n-v1<br />&nbsp; $(Device/tplink-8mlzma)<br />&nbsp; DEVICE_TITLE := TP-LINK TL-WR710N v1<br />&nbsp; DEVICE_PACKAGES := kmod-usb-core kmod-usb2<br />&nbsp; BOARDNAME := TL-WR710N<br />&nbsp; DEVICE_PROFILE := TLWR710<br />&nbsp; TPLINK_HWID := 0x07100001<br />&nbsp; CONSOLE := ttyATH0,115200<br />&nbsp; IMAGE/factory.bin := append-rootfs | mktplinkfw factory -C US<br />endef</p><br /><p>THAT&#039;S IT!</p><p>The more in depth explanation from Matthias is:</p><p>&quot;<br />Correct.</p><p>The default IMAGE/factory.bin definition used for TP-Link devices doesn&#039;t<br />set a region code (the default is defined in Device/tplink, which is<br />included by Device/tplink-nolzma, which is included by Device/tplink-8m,<br />included by Device/tl-wr710n-v1). The arguments &#039;-C US&#039; are passed to the<br />mktplinkfw tool (through the Build/mktplinkfw definition, but that&#039;s a bit<br />more complex...)</p><p>&quot;</p>									</div>

Not really, far easier and less chance to goof.<br />Besides, NO command lines (or similar) for the 75-90% that prefer not to go that route mostly because it&#039;s too complicated and/or confusing.</p><p>Use the factory-to-ddwrt-us bin to get rid of the &#039;locked&#039; TP_Link F/W (from Oct or Nov 2015), then the wdr3600v1_webrevert (your model number) bin to revert back to the origibal TP-Link F/W and lastly, your choice of the replacement Openwrt or dd-wrt F/W.</p>									</div>
