					<p>David suggested that I bring my questions to this thread.</p><p>I am bringing up a new WRT1900ACS with the build, and have some ipv6 (wan) to ipv4 lan issues.&nbsp; Please feel free to redirect as I know is more of a ipv6 to ipv4 config issue, but since it is probably relative to whats included in the package, I&#039;m starting here.</p><p>I am coming off a WNDR3700 running an older build of CC.&nbsp; My LAN is IPV4(and needs to stay that for now) , and I believe my CC build is still using 6relayd.&nbsp; The WAN gets both IPV6 and IPV4 addresses, connected to a bridged cable modem.&nbsp; The ISP is Comcast if that helps.</p><p>I know the stock is using odhcpd. I&#039;ve not configured/setup odhcpd before, and my ipv6 memory is fuzzy, as I set and forgot on the wndr.</p><p>Using the uci stock defaults&nbsp; for wan and wan6 config from the davidc502 build, the WRT1900ACS receives an IPV6 address (only) from Comcast on WAN6, but no IPV4 address, on WAN.&nbsp; And maybe thats by design, intending to default to native.</p><p>And at the router, using diags I can ping over wan, traceroute&nbsp; wan using ipv6. Obviously, not so much for IPV4, and my IPV4 clients on LAN cannot get out to WAN.</p><p>Apologies if its rudimentary, whats the right way to do this to get the IPV4 LAN clients working? I need to config and/or add dual stack, or other?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p><strong>@sera</strong>&nbsp; Thanks! =]&nbsp; @hnyman also mentioned samba.org changed it&#039;s download requirements, requiring all downloads to now use https <em>(I think he mentioned he was going to push makefile changes to OpenWrt to fix that issue)</em>.&nbsp; I edited the makefiles for samba and rsync to only use https as a quick fix, however your idea makes sense since another thing I noticed is when I redid the buildroot the first few times on a new Ubuntu install, a wget hst file was auto modded to 777 permissions, requiring a manual change.&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking the problems are stemming from my home mount since it&#039;s stored in a separate vhdx and imported into every new install, possibly from an inadvertent change(s) made when I setup mount points for my Android and Kali buildroots <em>(they&#039;re mounted within folders contained in my home folder).</em></p><br /><p><strong>@joekane</strong> Since U.S. ISPs haven&#039;t switched to IPv6 for 95% of customers, I&#039;ve never had to deal with IPv6, however, in the meantime until someone with more knowledge can reply, if you haven&#039;t already done so, I&#039;d check out the following OpenWrt wikis<br /></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/dhcp">DNS &amp; DHCP</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/odhcpd">oDHCPd</a><br /></p><ul><li><p>Per the <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/odhcp6c">oDHCP6c</a> wiki: <em>&quot;The OpenWrt embedded DHCPv6-client odhcp6c is a minimal DHCPv6 and RA-client for use in embedded Linux systems.&quot;</em><br /></p><ul><li><p>The <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/odhcp6c">oDHCP6c GitHub</a> provides slightly more details, but is still sparse.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/start">Technical Reference</a></p></li></ul><p><em>While this isn&#039;t in regards to your issue, if you do choose to switch to DD, it&#039;s recommended to switch to DNSmasq-Full and completely remove odhcpd.&nbsp; See <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt_ac_series#dhcp_dns">DHCP &amp; DNS Troubleshooting</a> in Wiki for the known issue.</em></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>JW0914</strong> on 2 Feb 2017, 21:42)</p>

					<p><strong>@JWC0914</strong>&nbsp; Appreciate the response. I have been through the wikis and setups, but I am swimming in the deep pool, and they are very sparse as you note.</p><p>If I could just get the IPV4 to WAN working , I could switch to DD (and maybe I just have to disable IPV6 at WAN side to effect that).&nbsp; But the older running CC (with relay6d and maybe some other pkgs) gets assigned IPV6 and IpV4 on WAN, and everything works.&nbsp; So I was really just trying to replicate the WAN connectivity on the WRT1900acs. </p><p>Whatever DD is doing only results in an IPV6 address(and a single&nbsp; /128). </p><p>I see relay6d was deprecated to odhcpd, which may now be deprecated to dnsmasq-full as you note.&nbsp; Looking for what the current &#039;right&#039; thing to do is.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think he means that relay6d was discontinued as default in favor of odhcpd which was then phased out in favor of a stand-alone dnsmasq-dhcp6</p>									</div>
