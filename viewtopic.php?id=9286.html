					<p>I have a Novatel U720 USB EVDO modem which hooks up to my computer via a USB port.&nbsp; I&#039;m currently sharing this connection through windows connection sharing (yuck).</p><p>I&#039;d like to know if its possible/likely that I&#039;ll be able to make the U720 card work with one of the many routers that have usb support.</p><p>I see the Kyrocera kr1 unit does this from the factory, but the router costs about $250 USD + I really don&#039;t want to spend that kind of money on a router if a sub $100 router will do the same job.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>teststrips</strong> on 2 Feb 2007, 22:16)</p>

					<p>I got this modem working on a laptop running Ubuntu.&nbsp; There is a long pdf telling you how to do this at Sprint:</p><p><a href="http://www4.sprint.com/pcsbusiness/downloads/Sprint_Mobile_Broadband_Setup_Guide.pdf">http://www4.sprint.com/pcsbusiness/down â€¦ _Guide.pdf</a></p><p>The basic things you need are:</p><p>1) The usbserial module loaded;</p><p>2) Some sort of dialing software; I was able to do it first with a simple chat script and pppd; then I used KPPP on Ubuntu</p><p>3) The user and password are not checked, the dialing number is #777</p><p>4) The modem I was using had already been activated; if this is not true, you have to activate it, sigh, under Winders.</p><p>My feeling is that it wouldn&#039;t be too hard to get this working with a router, but I haven&#039;t actually done it.</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>									</div>
