					<p>Hi all, </p><p>I need to connect a laundry room to the internet and to be able to give it a public static IP. (Some of you might ask why, and the reason is that its required from the laundry billing software. It needs direct access using a public static IP + Port 5000 to 5010). The problem is, that I have no connection to the laundry room today and it will take a least 6 months before I get a wired connection there, so my best choice would be to put 4G/LTE capable router there. Unfortunately its not possible to get a mobile-subscription with public static IP, so for that I would like to make the laundry room network a part of my own network. I got a public static IP so I will share the 10 ports in the range from my own network. The traffic will be close to none. </p><p>1) I got an Asus RT-AC66U with VPN Server enabled<br />2) I buy a 4g LTE dongle, a flatrate mobile subscription and an OpenWRT compatible router for the laundry room.<br />3) I connect the OpenWRT router to my Asus RT-AC66U using the VPN client in OpenWRT as a permanent solution.<br />4) I wire the OpenWRT routers LAN side to the laundry system, and disable WIFI.<br />5) I give the laundry system at internal static IP address (from my local range)<br />6) I make a WAN- Virtual Server / Port Forwarding rule on my Asus RT-AC66U to the laundry systems IP address.</p><p>QUESTION: <br />1) Will it work: Hitting my public IP with fx port 5000 will give direct access to the laundry system?<br />2) Will OpenVPN be able to keep a connection open, even if the router in the laundry room is rebooted?<br />3) Any better ideas?<br />4) What 4g/LTE dongle and router will work well with OpenWRT?<br />5) Did I miss anything explaining the problem and the solution?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>qwwwizx</strong> on 4 Jan 2015, 03:08)</p>

					<p>LTE dongles are hit and miss, make sure you know which model number works with OpenWRT. You don&#039;t really need public static address if you use dyndns services.</p><p>1.When you hit your public IP port, you need to tunnel into your VPN server first. Then you access your 5000 port using your internal IP address.<br />2.OpenVPN connection will be reset if your laundry room router has been rebooted.<br />5.You might want to experiment with OpenVPN first ideally using easier to setup system like a plain Linux laptop, it seems your networking concepts are not that clear.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>iamalittlepepper</strong> on 6 Jan 2015, 13:39)</p>

					<p>Hi dear,<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>1- OpenVPN server need Public IP
2- OpenVPN client don&#039;t need Public IP</code></pre></div><p>With OpenVPN client you are able to redirect all port you want to the OpenVPN server, then the server need to redirect this port out of your WAN with Public IP :<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>OVPN Client ------------&gt;&gt;OVPN Server -------------&gt;&gt; WAN Public IP</code></pre></div><p>In a router with OpenVPN support ( OPENWRT ) is the same concept, but you need to make firewall rules which redirect port or some port to an internal IP out through OpenVPN tunnel .</p><p>I don&#039;t tested OpenWRT with any mobile dongle and I can&#039;t give you an answer, but if it will not work, you can install two machine :<br />First for the dongle support and setup it as bridge...<br />Second with openwrt as router mode and openvpn client...</p><p>Rgrds 98</p>									</div>
