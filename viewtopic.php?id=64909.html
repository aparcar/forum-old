					<p>Hello,</p><p>before I upload OpenWRT on my TP-Link TL-WR1043ND router I try to learn how it works on a VirtualBox installation. So far I managed to compile myself OpenWRT from the trunk tree including CUPS 1.5.4. For the compilation of CUPS 1.5.4 I needed to change some very small options in the .configure file but except of this everything was successfull. CUPS is running.<br />There is one point which is not okay and I hope You can help me:<br />If I click In the very left section &quot;CUPS for Users&quot; on one item it tells me:<br />&quot;Unable to access help file.&quot;<br />Regarding the online help from the top menu it is similar. The entry page appears but the links inside show the same message.<br />I have the feeling that either:<br /></p><ul><li><p>the online help is not installed, or</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>some config file must be adjusted to point on th right location.</p></li></ul><p>Any suggestions</p><p>Thank You in advance</p><p>Wolfgang</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>WolfgangG</strong> on 17 May 2016, 22:37)</p>

					<p>Hello again,</p><p>I found the solution myself by comparing a running cups installation on openSuSE13.1.<br />For others which might have the same question here is the answer.</p><p>Briefly, what You need to do is to copy&nbsp; to copy the <strong><em>help</em></strong> folder which can be found in the build tree of cups to the folder <strong><em>/usr/share/doc/cups</em></strong> recursively and maintaining the parent folder <strong><em>help</em></strong><br />After the initial installation of cups You will find already in the folder <strong><em>/usr/share/doc/cups</em></strong> the file <strong><em>index.html</em></strong> which is the starting point. This file is copied using the ipk procedures but the rest was not copied in my case. This is way I needed to do in manually.</p><p>After rebooting the router the CUPS online help is available.</p><p>Be aware that the online help consumes something like 1.5 MBytes which is quite a lot for a small router.<br />However, it works.</p><p>Good luck.</p><p>Wolfgang</p>									</div>
