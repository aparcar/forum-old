					<p>Installed Kamikaze 8.09.2 on my Linksys WRT54G V3 router using openwrt-bcm47xx&nbsp; and openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs files.<br />All went ok, but when&nbsp; logged into LuCI&#039;s webpage, Administration,Network,WIFI: This section contains no values ! Create network: Device: Please choose: empty <br />Read WIKI Wifi page, it say WIFI is disabled by default ! ( strange, why disable a wifi in a wireless router ??)<br />Wiki also revealed, that wifi can be enabled in /etc/config/wireless......unfortunately, this file does not even exist!<br />Looks like, to have a wireless working on a wireless router, config + drivers needs to be created from scratch ! :-(<br />I have a Windows xp computer and familiar to use WinSCP and Putty to access router.<br />Looking for any good advise to solve this problem (which should not be exist at all) in the most easy and quick way ?<br />Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>the wifi is disabled because this is the only secure way to do it. <br />What would be the alternative? setup an open wifi-network? An encrypted network with an known key? At home I get 4 wifi-networks from neigbours (Thomson/Speedlink-Modems) which use the preconfigured wifi-setup by the vendor, and I can connect to all of them. And they have no password-protection on the webinterface either, so yeah this would be a really good approach for openwrt, too. So after you flash openwrt everyone can connect to your router and set a password, that is really a great idea. </p><p>and now to your problem: </p><p>Why are you using kamikaze? it&#039;s from 2009! get backfire 10.03.1<br />for configuring wifi check this out: <br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/wireless.essentials">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/wireless.essentials</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt54g">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt54g</a></p><p>and for your hardware there are two options the properitary driver from broadcom, or the opensource driver (b43). I&#039;m not sure about the situation in backfire because I don&#039;t use broadcom-chip anymore, and broadcom has released some opensource-drivers itself. But in kamikaze you have to decide if you get bcm-2.4-target with kernel 2.4.x and the broadcom-driver, or the brcm47xx-target with kernel 2.6.x (or 3.x) and the opensource driver (b43). So get a firmware for the right target-plattform, install the right driver, run wifi-detect&nbsp; and then configure your wifi-network.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 3 Jul 2012, 11:36)</p>

					<p>thanks for your reply<br />backfire is much more bigger than kamikaze, my wrt54g has very limited memory, I needed every bit,&nbsp; to install a custom apps in the jffs2 file system<br />already read the wiki about wifi, and&nbsp; got no intention &amp; time to reinvent a wheel from scratch<br />meanwhile, downloaded and installed TOMATO, everything works by default<br />all wireless settings are showing&nbsp; in the GUI menu, just needed to put a checkmark in a box, choose encryption mode, and enter key<br />this is how openwrt should have done it</p>									</div>

					<p>You flashed the wrong image. The one you&#039;ve picked contains no wireless support. In fact the folder you&#039;ve downloaded it from contains a notice &quot;NO-BROADCOM-WIRELESS&quot; and the release notes also mention the fact that there is no wifi support for brcm47xx.</p><p>But that is okay, good luck with Tomato.</p>									</div>
