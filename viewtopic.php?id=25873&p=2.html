					<p>Cou could deactivate the firewall for tinyproxy at all ( /etc/init.d/firewall stop) to be sure. Also verify with &quot;netstat -lnp&quot; that tinyproxy is listening on the right interfaces (e.g. 0.0.0.0 for all interfaces).</p>									</div>

					<p>I should point out that on my latest build of the backfire branch, with no packages, things were fast (as mentioned before) but again, I couldn&#039;t get tinyproxy working.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t make any sense!&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; I even restored the cfg files from a build where it was working and it was STILL broken.</p><p>On the device itself, I can connect to tinyproxy with wget http://localhost:8888/ but NOT wget <a href="http://192.168.1.1:8888">http://192.168.1.1:8888</a>/, so you&#039;re right, it might not be listening on the correct interface.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, so it seems that was the issue.&nbsp; According to the tinyproxy documentation, it&#039;s supposed to listen on all interfaces by default.&nbsp; However, for some reason, the build in OpenWRT was only listening on 127.0.0.1.</p><p>I added &quot;Listen 0.0.0.0&quot; to the config file and restarted and now I have no issue connecting.&nbsp; That&#039;s an easy one to solve.&nbsp; Do you think I should file a bug for this?</p><p>Now, I&#039;ll try to do a build using the packages that I need and we&#039;ll see whether or not that will work, I&#039;ll include your LAN fix as well.&nbsp; </p><p>Thanks for the help!&nbsp; Hopefully everything works well moving forward.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, I&#039;m only posting this here in case someone else encounters the issue.&nbsp; Having said that, I can&#039;t believe how stupid I was... :-D</p><p>So it turns out the problem was that I was using the default speed values in the QOS package.&nbsp; Once I changed the values to my actual connection speed the router behaved as expected.</p><p>I&#039;m using the latest build of the backfire branch and it is nice and quick, easily performing as well as my WRT54GL.</p><p>Memphis, thank you for all your help.&nbsp; I learned a ton about OpenWRT in the process.</p>									</div>
