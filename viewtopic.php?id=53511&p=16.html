					<p>So I thought about this a little and I might salvage this router if I can use it as a repeater (can anyone confirm its possible on this? I know it can make multiple network broadcasts so I assume it might), as I decided the ASUS one is definetly best as main. The Telenor-branded software made wi-fi behave quite unstable and I suspect that there might be files missing due to the bootlog after the storage got wiped when I had an outage. No matter how much I did it&#039;s been living its own life, maybe its damaged? I hope not, as long as it is stable at times it should be okay. It would also be interesting if I could get the SIP functionality to work, but&nbsp; as the wiki states &quot;WIP&nbsp; &nbsp; VR9 based devices needs some work.&quot;</p><p>In the wiki its written about compiling from trunk and flashing but if I&#039;m not mistaken the smartest thing to do would be to grab your pre-built packages at <a href="https://github.com/ScApi/P2812HNUFx-Pre-Build/tree/OpenWrt-Chaos-Calmer-r45578/F3%20OpenWRT">https://github.com/ScApi/P2812HNUFx-Pre … %20OpenWRT</a> (wiki states trunk r43988)? And use those when i flash (as I would need to get those bootloaders anyway and it already contains wi-fi fix). I can just use it on the same firmware for how long the device lives but you never know if something important such as Hearthbleed ever show up, assuming that they never will be updated since your device got broken and its custom?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>courfazor</strong> on 7 Aug 2015, 22:32)</p>

After it boots the light turns red only (or both are on), I disabled power2 in the LED controls and now it only blinks red when it starts and is green after boot. I wonder if this is normal behaviour or perhaps I did something wrong? Either way it seems to be working I just never had routers blinking red without any particular reason except something wrong in the past <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Edit: I have been trying to get the internet connection up and running for a while now without success. I&#039;m not used to running OpenWRT and the closest I&#039;ve been is DD-WRT on an ASUS router. Either way there were a few things I noticed.<br />When I connect the WAN port I get this message:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Sun Apr 26 15:01:58 2015 kern.info kernel: [  106.100000] eth0: port 5 got link</code></pre></div><p>The WAN light becomes green but as its on eth0 no other interface comes up in ifconfig (lo, eth0, eth0.1, br-lan is up) and according to the panel nas0 which I assume is supposed to be the WAN port? does not appear as up and no MAC is even assigned: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/ddO5E">http://imgur.com/a/ddO5E</a><br />While I was at it I changed WAN from PPPoE to DHCP-Client as the ASUS router works with aggresive DHCP query, I assumed this was default on WAN port but nvm. I also noticed that in the switch even if I use LAN port in slot 1 it comes up as port4? and port5 is the WAN port confirmed by the fact that it says its linked from logs.</p><p>I have experienced the fact that the WAN port has been misplaced by DD-WRT before and I&#039;ve had to correct this or it would be looked at as a LAN port (like here?), since I&#039;m not exactly aware of how to do that in OpenWRT (I can probably check out documentation) but I feel like there must be somebody else who can comment on this since I might be about to do something I&#039;m not supposed to do as others have used the exact same method before.</p><p>Notes: I can just specify a MAC for WAN (nas0) in /etc/config/network and/or give it an ifname such as eth0.2?</p><p>My provider does not use DSL technology therefore DHCP in aggresive is going to do the trick, I have 7 LAN ports on their home central which by my request lets me assign seperate dynamic IPs when different devices query it. It only gives IPv4 so no need for wan6 and since I don&#039;t use DSL I have not placed annex B drivers and set that up in /etc/config/network</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>courfazor</strong> on 9 Aug 2015, 14:49)</p>

					<p>Thank you for replying, I was thinking that maybe I wrote too much you would not bother reading it all <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Still, should I wait if you ever push one with WAN port fixed or just continue to use what I have this far?</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>scapi wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>What MAC, LAN / WAN / WLAN / VDSL ?<br />WAN/LAN MAC is taken from U-Boot, so if You set it up there it should be ok, WLAN MAC is from EEPROM, nas0/VDSL is calculated in API.</p></blockquote></div><p>Ah, well it make sense to get it from flash. Since I for the time being do not use ADSL (nas0) that does not matter, wanted MAC for LAN and wi-fi to be correct. I guess since u-boot is replaced now I could do this by using COM cable aborting normal boot, too bad that I put the device back together now since I&#039;ll have to open it again - I assume?<br />I have your pre-built Chaos Calmer from Github, maybe I&#039;ll just bother to change the MAC for WLAN on EEPROM if you can write that over SSH, which should be possible.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>scapi wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>You should change OpenWRT to different subnet.</p></blockquote></div><p>Thanks for pointing that out.

I got a repeater to work like I wanted to and I can access the same LAN IP through both the Wi-Fi routers, which was like a dream to me which came true using OpenWrt.</p><p>However, I feel like I can&#039;t reach the max Wi-Fi capacity and my logs keep getting these replies:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Sun Sep  6 08:42:43 2015 kern.err kernel: [754973.640000] eth0: tx ring full</code></pre></div><p>I believe that either the router itself is incapable of these transfer speeds or something with the firmware, I&#039;m running the EEPROM which came on the pre-built GitHub, it&#039;s the one that allowed the fastest transfer speeds? It&#039;s a little weird that this router claiming to have 1 Gbit/s LAN output (although I&#039;m a little skeptic to that) does perform slightly worse than the cheap ASUS which has 100 Megabit/s ones (of course the LAN ports are completely unrelated to the WI-Fi chip and antennas)</p><p>With multiple connection through Steam I managed to push up the transfer speed to ~3.4 MB/s however with slight variations and somewhat unstable in the long term going down (sometimes plummeting to nothing) and up to the max ~3.4 MB/s again. My fibre handles max 3.75 Megabyte/s in case that matters. Not like I need to take full advantage of my line by any means it&#039;s just that I&#039;m very interested informing, and once again thank you for providing the firmware and even compiling it for me.</p><p>I remember that open-source Wi-Fi drivers and such often perform way worse than the closed source ones since they are the most adapted ones, thus I often get worse performance when I move to either OpenWrt or DD-WRT previous times I have done the exact same thing to other routers.</p><p>Otherwise everything seem to be performing as intended with lease time of 600:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Sun Sep  6 08:00:17 2015 daemon.info hostapd: wlan0: STA 28:b2:bd:**:**:** WPA: group key handshake completed (RSN)
