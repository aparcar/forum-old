					<p>I will start this with saying I&#039;m happy I&#039;ve made the transition from DD-WRT to OpenWrt and hello to all forum members! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> I am a green horn when it comes to working with configuration of networks and I&#039;ve come across my first question regarding this firmware.</p><p>I&#039;m running on a Netgear N600 with Attitude Adjustment (r27096) that was completed by the Netgear GUI with this IMG file below.<br />(<a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-wndr3700v2-squashfs-factory.img">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ â€¦ actory.img</a>)</p><p>The flash went without a hitch and I managed to get Luci and DDNS service installed. I am able to access Luci and SSH within my own network without any issues at all. These two work just fine as long as I&#039;m accessing them while at home but I am unable to get access to either from my office at work. I have been able to ping my router so I know the DDNS is working fine and that some connectivity exists.</p><p>I have included the data that I think is relevant from my existing setup.</p><p>/etc/config/dropbear</p><p>config &#039;dropbear&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;PasswordAuth&#039; &#039;on&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;GatewayPorts&#039; &#039;on&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;Port&#039; &#039;22&#039;</p><p>======================================================</p><p>/etc/config/firewall</p><br /><p>config &#039;defaults&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;syn_flood&#039; &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;input&#039; &#039;ACCEPT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;output&#039; &#039;ACCEPT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;forward&#039; &#039;REJECT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;drop_invalid&#039; &#039;1&#039;</p><p>config &#039;zone&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;name&#039; &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;network&#039; &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;input&#039; &#039;ACCEPT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;output&#039; &#039;ACCEPT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;forward&#039; &#039;REJECT&#039;</p><p>config &#039;zone&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;name&#039; &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;network&#039; &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;input&#039; &#039;REJECT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;output&#039; &#039;ACCEPT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;forward&#039; &#039;REJECT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;masq&#039; &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;mtu_fix&#039; &#039;1&#039;</p><p>config &#039;forwarding&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;src&#039; &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;dest&#039; &#039;wan&#039;</p><p>config &#039;rule&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;src&#039; &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;udp&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;dest_port&#039; &#039;68&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;target&#039; &#039;ACCEPT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;family&#039; &#039;ipv4&#039;</p><p>config &#039;rule&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;src&#039; &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;icmp&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;icmp_type&#039; &#039;echo-request&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;target&#039; &#039;ACCEPT&#039;</p><p>config &#039;include&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;path&#039; &#039;/etc/firewall.user&#039;</p><p>======================================================</p><p>/etc/firewall.user</p><p># This file is interpreted as shell script.<br /># Put your custom iptables rules here, they will<br /># be executed with each firewall (re-)start.</p><p>======================================================</p><p>I will point out that I started using OpenWrt to have similar firmware running on the very same router a friend of mine also utilizes. The difference between our firmware is that he is running &quot;Attitude Adjustment (r26290)&quot; and is able to access his web console and SSH remotely.</p><p>This is hopefully enough information to help diagnose what I&#039;m doing wrong or didn&#039;t do.</p>									</div>

It really appears that this release [(r27096)] is a little more secure than (r26290). I have reviewed an export of my friends firewall configuration and nowhere is there any indication of the SSH or Luci web console port being available to the WAN.</p><p>[Not sure if anyone cares about this information but seeing as these are ports on that release that aren&#039;t documented in the firewall configuration -- what other ports may be outward facing and open?]</p><br /><p>@fyi -- thank you for the links in your post. I will be taking advantage of the Luci essentials link.</p>									</div>
