					<p>I can&#039;t speak on the technical side of it, but personally I&#039;d say it comes across a bit mercenary to demand people like/follow you in return for getting on your wifi. Why not just have that as an option (along with joining your mailing-list if they want) on the landing-page? Isn&#039;t it better if the people who &quot;like&quot; you actually mean it?</p><p>I guess most people don&#039;t feel this way when it comes to marketing, but if it was me I&#039;d be pretty turned off by it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah, that sucks. I find it unethic to force people to like this or that in return for something. Many people does not have facebook at all, I&#039;m one of them. I don&#039;t know what&#039;s this facebook madness about. It got that far, that to download some script code I was interested in, I needed to create fake facebook account fist to login to that page, I don&#039;t remeber the url, but at least nobody forced me to like them, that&#039;s pure evil! If there would be dislike icon, I&#039;d have it pressed for sure <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 17 Jan 2014, 12:42)</p>

					<p>Coova supports HTTP Auth rather than radius. You could chain the api call to query your facebook or google plus groups? <a href="http://coova.org/CoovaChilli/Proxy">http://coova.org/CoovaChilli/Proxy</a></p><p>I agree 100% on the facebook crap.</p>									</div>
