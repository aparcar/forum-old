					<p>I installed OpenWRT (with X-wrt) on my Linksys WRT54G v2.2 router over the weekend. I used the broadcom version with the 2.4 kernel. Most everything is working but I do have a couple issues that I need help on. </p><p>The major issue that I&#039;m having is that anytime I reboot the router, I don&#039;t get a WAN IP address. In order to get a WAN IP, I need to reboot the modem and then the router. I have cable internet through Comcast and have had no issues before installing OpenWRT. Any ideas on how to fix this?</p><p>Second, which VPN server should I use for connecting up both Linux and Windows hosts? I&#039;ll be using Linux 95% of the time but there may be times when I&#039;ll be on Windows and will need to VPN into my home network.</p><p>Third, what packages can I remove from the default install? I would like to keep the router as bloat free as possible.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Kevin</p>									</div>

					<p>kevin79,</p><p>1.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know why you have to reboot your modem everytime you have to reboot your router.&nbsp; Comcast cable should be dhcp so<br />the router should automatically obtian an IP and it should be all good.&nbsp; I have tried OpenWRT on almost every single ISP execpt for<br />Comcast but it should be the same.</p><p>2. You can use any type of vpn depending on your needs.&nbsp; You can setup OpenVPN or use OpenSWAN, I have never played with OpenVPN<br />but I use OpenSWAN and it works perfeclty.</p><p>3. If you downloaded the image and just loaded it, it is basically bare minimum by default. You shouldn&#039;t need to strip anything down as a matter a<br />fact you will need to start adding stuff.</p><p>Hope this helped.</p><p>ScarEye</p>									</div>

					<p>1 - Comcast is DHCP. Like I said, it worked fine before. I even tried reflashing the router but it does the same thing.</p><p>2 - Does OpenSwan have a Windows client?</p>									</div>
