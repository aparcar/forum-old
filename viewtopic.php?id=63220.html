					<p>* You might check that you have the newest version of your ssh client. (e.g. putty 0.67)<br />* Try with another ssh client to eliminate incompatibility<br />* Try login without public key, just using password.<br />* You might also let dropbear to re-generate its hostkeys by deleting the key files from /etc/dropbear:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;/etc/dropbear/dropbear_dss_host_key&nbsp; /etc/dropbear/dropbear_rsa_host_key<br />* You might generate a new keypair for yourself.<br />* And of course, reset all router settings. That can be done from Luci.</p><p>(My guess is that the list of accepted key formats has changed since either the host keys or your personal keys were created. Or something like that)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 21 Mar 2016, 23:17)</p>
