					<p>Looking through the supported list, finding lots of interesting leads but most gigabit devices are larger than I need, most with a switch included and wireless.</p><p>I just need one of those mini routers or similar but with a gigabit interface and even more importantly that is supported, not in trunk but what ever you call the main code that I can build using Image Builder.</p><p>Would appreciate any input you might have on devices that might fit this.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>well you can just slap in a sd card on it no problems, id rather had a removable storage than a fixate storage to mess around it, with that I dont have to worry about the write cycles on flash memory that is common problem on routers.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>remlei</strong> on 11 Jul 2016, 02:05)</p>

					<p>I hear you but in my case, I need them to have internal storage. I&#039;ve only ever heard about the flash memory dying but have never seen it. I&#039;ve been running some devices like tp-links for over two years 24/7 non stop without any issues what so ever.</p>									</div>

					<p>well I guess banana pi is not for your suits then. </p><p>there&#039;s a atom based development board that had gigabit ethernet and mini-pcie slot on it, with usb slots etc... it also had a 8gb internal memory as well. It has a similar sized of raspberry pi. but this board is very expensive might as well just buy a full size router that had better spec (r7000) or a APU based router.</p>									</div>

					<p>Being overly specific doesn&#039;t help much either so I try to be a little generic. I&#039;ve spent quite a lot of time searching before posting so knew there isn&#039;t much out there but often, someone in the community knows of something so it&#039;s worth a shot.</p><p>I&#039;m mainly just looking for new supported devices that won&#039;t go away in 6 months. The main problem I am having is that once I find something interesting, it usually stops being manufactured or changed greatly in another newer version. I&#039;m trying to find something I can stick to for a long time to come.</p><p>I&#039;m looking for something like an ultra mini PC because they are interesting, with or without gigabit NIC and I&#039;m looking for a small device with a gigabit NIC, two better. </p><p>To answer your questions;</p><p>&gt;1 or 2 Ethernet?<br />Two better but might have to live with one if that&#039;s all I can find.</p><p>&gt;What type\size storage?<br />64MB internal storage would be ideal but I figured any device that comes with gigabit ports would have a reasonable amount of built in storage.</p><p>&gt;USB ports?<br />Don&#039;t use them so nice if it&#039;s got any but doesn&#039;t matter if not.</p><p>&gt;CPU, Memory, Flash?<br />8MB memory, 64MB internal storage would be ideal.</p><p>&gt;Max physical size?<br />Mini router sized would be ideal, like the small tp-link devices, gl.inet, etc etc. Again, cannot get too specific however but would prefer it comes in a case.</p><p>&gt;Price?<br />Around the $50.00 mark would be ideal but again, it&#039;s subject to what is out there and there isn&#039;t much especially in that price range other than arduino and such boards.</p><p>This is a part time thing for me. I wish I was a full time developer on these things then I would probably know much more about what&#039;s out there.</p>									</div>
