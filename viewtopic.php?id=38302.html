					<p>Hi?</p><p>I&#039;m new to OpenWRT and linux... Now I am trying to install a netem for this router W54GL. </p><p>I&#039;ve tried to download an iproute rpm which includes netem, but there is no &quot;rpm&quot; command to install it. Then I have tried to put &quot;q_netem.so&quot; and &quot;sch_netem.o&quot; into certain directories, but I couldn&#039;t find sch_netem.o available online. Meanwhile, if I compile the .o file myself, I am still confused with the different version of sch_netem.c... A ipk file(tc_2.6.25-1_mipsel.ipk, found in forum) is also downloaded, but there is no &quot;ipkg&quot; nor &quot;opkg&quot; command...</p><p>So,1.&nbsp; Could anybody briefly explain to me what are &quot;busybox&quot; and &quot;KAMIKAZE&quot;? I have no idea about the relationship between them and some explanation online makes me more confused. Do they determine the kernel or something...Sorry for this silly question...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.&nbsp; I find&nbsp; there is limited command in this router, what can I do to expand it? Do I need to change kernel or install sth? Or do you have some methods to address my problem?&nbsp; I have been stuck here for 2 weeks..</p><br /><p>Some of the parameters are listed below:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; WRT54GL&nbsp; &nbsp; busybox v1.11.2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;KAMIKAZE8.09.2,r18961 </p><p>Any help will be highly appreciated. Thanks~ <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
