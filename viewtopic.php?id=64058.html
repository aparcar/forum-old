					<p>There was a thread back in 2012 discussing the same topic. I want to get an update on what i can buy today that will satisfy the following requirements</p><p>* openvpn as client on the router should have a decent throughput (20-25Mbps) or better<br />* Dualband preferably<br />* Wireless AC nice to have </p><p>Appreciate your help and suggestions</p>									</div>

					<p>Don&#039;t use all-in-one routers for everything. Use such router only as wireless AP.<br />For gateway take something like Lamobo PI. It must have 2+ core arm or x86 cpu.<br />I use dlink dir-825 as openvpn AES128 endpoint. Only have about 10 mbps. cpu is too slow for more.<br />With Banana PI I have 50 mbits from one core.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bolvan</strong> on 9 Apr 2016, 18:35)</p>

There are many other routers (Linksys EA8500 and a netgear I forgot the model) that have the same SoC but cost more..</p><p>In my opinion the C2600 is even better overall than the WRT1900AC(x) (although it has only 32MB flash).. but the linksys is just far more popular because they advertised &quot;open source ready&quot;, and maybe their WRT54G heritage came into play since its kinda a household icon..</p><p>The WRT1900ac(x) thread in this forum is very active, while the C2600 club seems to be a handful of people... perhaps they have no problems and hence the thread is not active <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Careful when buying TPLinks (if you are in US) since they started locking down.. AFAIK the C2600 is still flashable..</p><p>Anyways shop around, there are many choices.</p>									</div>
