					<p>I&#039;m seeking confirmation that you can reflash a Linksys WRT54G3GV2-VF with a <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Hard_reset_or_30/30/30">30/30/30 hard reset</a>.</p><p>My Linksys WRT54G3GV2-VF wouldn&#039;t boot after a sysupgrade. The power LED wouldn&#039;t stop blinking. After re-reading the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt54g3gv2-vf">wiki page</a>, I was under the impression that I would have to open the case and attach a serial console.</p><p>Nevertheless, I tried this:<br/>&nbsp; - Push the reset button for 30 seconds with power on<br/>&nbsp; - Turn off power and keep reset pressed for another 30 seconds<br/>&nbsp; - Turn power back on and keep reset pressed for final 30 seconds<br/>&nbsp; - Just before releasing the reset button, start a TFTP client to put a (factory) image to 192.168.1.1 (in binary mode)</p><p>The TFTP file transfer was successfull. The router booted with the newly installed firmware.</p><p>Can anybody confirm this works before I dare to put it into the wiki?</p><p>Thanks, maf</p>									</div>

					<p>Strange. Some messages of this thread have been lost. curiouswombat had confirmed this procedure on July 17th. And I think I put a note here when I edited the wiki page. Anyways...</p><p>You have to connect the router to a PC via ethernet. Assign an IP address in the subnet 192.168.1.* to the ethernet interface of the PC, start tftp on the PC, connect to the router, set binary mode, and transfer the image once the router accepts it. Something like<br/></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@gyro:/home/malte/linksys# tftp
tftp&gt; connect 192.168.1.1

Transfer timed out.

					<p>Thanks!</p><p>Right now I can probably get into the device with a serial cable (it replied to ping on 192.168.1.1)</p><p>Of those two methods, TFTP in the bootloader and serial console in the booted OS, do either pose a risk of totally destroying the device beyond JTAG? Because it doesn&#039;t have JTAG.</p><p>For instance, reading that log, how does TFTP know where to write it?

					<p>Re-reading the wiki now I know what TFTP is, does this bit mean that all I have to do is boot the device 3 times and I can run TFTP?<br/><em><br/>The CFE sets &quot;try1&quot; to 0x0074 == &#039;t&#039; when it executes the image for the first time. If everything works fine the running system sets the value for &quot;stable&quot; to 0x0073 == &#039;s&#039;. When CFE does not find the &#039;s&#039; it continues with setting &#039;t&#039; to &#039;try2&#039; and so on.</em></p><p><em>Finally when try1 to try3 are set and stable is still unset CFE assumes that the image is broken and won&#039;t start anymore. It now starts listening on TFTP for a new firmware image. Nevertheless you can still force the CFE to load the current image with the followin command: &quot;boot -raw -z -addr=0x80001000 -max=0xf40000 flash0.os:&quot;.</em></p><p><em>When I try to set &#039;stable&#039; manually it will accept it but check if there is a valid second image as fallback. If not CFE simply copies the first 8MB over the second 8MB destroying any jffs2 data the former running system might have written there. </em></p><p>The device already returns a ping from 192.168.1.1 from boot and indefinitely.<br/>So maybe this CFE bootloader is in it&#039;s own recovery mode now?</p>									</div>

					<p>I guess if there is anything like 30/30/30, it would be implemented by the board&#039;s bootloader and not depend on the firmware (DD-Wrt, OpenWrt, ...).</p><p>By now, I believe that 30/30/30 does not work on the WRT54G3GV2-VF. Currently, my best guess is that if you manage to flash a firmware and something goes wrong (like a <a href="https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/2010-June/007284.html">boot failure</a> or <a href="https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/2010-June/007331.html">CRC checksum error</a>), the booloader will eventually start the TFTP server. And that might look like 30/30/30 has worked.</p><p>Here is a message I sent to the OpenWrt User mailing list in February, unfortunately without receiving a reply. I still would like to find out how to perform a sysupgrade on a WRT54G3GV2-VF. May be someone here knows...</p><br/><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2014 19:15:39 +0100<br/>Newsgroups: gmane.comp.embedded.openwrt.user<br/>Subject: How to upgrade a WRT54G3GV2-VF</p><p>Hi,</p><p>According to the wiki page for the WRT54G3GV2-VF [1] there a two ways to<br/>install OpenWrt: (1) Using the Linksys web interface and (2) using CFE.<br/>But how about upgrading once OpenWrt has been installed? Is a serial<br/>console the only option available? Here is what I tried.</p><p>I successfully installed snapshot r39482 using method (1). I then<br/>uploaded a new image (build from r39487) and tried sysupgrade. I got the<br/>error reported in #15008 [2]</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Writing from &lt;stdin&gt; to firmware ...&nbsp; [e]Failed to erase block</p><p>and the router simply rebooted into its prior state (old firmware and<br/>configuration).</p><p>After that I tried LuCI. The interface warned me that my image was too<br/>large (actually, its about 5,5 MB) and that there were only &quot;32.00 B<br/>available&quot;. I flashed it anyway. After the reboot the router ended up<br/>running its TFTP server.</p><p>Now I was able to upload the image via TFTP. It got flashed and the<br/>router rebooted into the new firmware. Obviously, my configuration was lost.</p><p>I used to think that you could perform a 30/30/30 reset on the<br/>WRT54G3GV2-VF to start its TFTP server. I don&#039;t believe that anymore. I<br/>tried a couple of these resets and they just cleared the configuration.</p><p>Questions:<br/> - Is there anything I did wrong to cause the problems?<br/> - Is there a way to upgrade OpenWrt on a WRT54G3GV2-VF?<br/> - Are the problems I observed bugs that I should report?<br/> - If the problems are in fact intended or known behavior, is there<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;any chance that this behavior will be improved in the future?</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Malte</p><br/><p>[1] <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt54g3gv2-vf">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt54g3gv2-vf</a><br/>[2] <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/15008:">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/15008:</a></p></blockquote></div>									</div>
