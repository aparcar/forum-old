					<p>I have a problem, I&#039;ve messed something up with LAN (was trying to set up a bridge AP) and failed miserably. Now the router is stuck on static IP, but even when I use the correct IP it still doesn&#039;t work, so I tried to do failsafe mode with the I.P 192.168.1.2 but that doesn&#039;t work either, no ping response or anything, I&#039;ve tried SSH and Telnet but to no avail, and I have tried every lan port and wan port, but my PC still marks it as a unidentified network. So am I basically left with a brick? The router I have is the WNR1000v2-VC. And no, I cannot open the router up and plug in via serial, so please don&#039;t say that.</p>									</div>

					<p>I can ping during the early stage of booting but whenever I press the reset button it still doesn&#039;t boot into failsafe. I think that the normal failsafe method doesn&#039;t work on 15.05 (holding reset button while powering on) and none of the buttons do nothing on this firmware? Guess I have to try the packet sniffer method?</p>									</div>

					<p>In a normal boot, one of the LEDs will start flashing rapidly, then slowly, then stay on.&nbsp; If you press the reset button at the stage where it is flashing rapidly, it should start flashing very rapidly instead of changing to slowly.&nbsp; This is failsafe mode.</p>									</div>

And it can be rather hard to know the correct moment. Like mk24 says, the preinit process tries to adjust LED blinking speed to indicate the &quot;look for failsafe trigger&quot; moment.</p><p>Ps. I have lengthened the trigger window time to 5 seconds in my own build. There is a preinit option for it in menuconfig.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 2 Jan 2017, 16:09)</p>
