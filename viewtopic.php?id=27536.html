					<p>eleon216, your dmesg output shows that your card is coded with a world regulatory domain (0x60) and you’re trying to set it up for AT. I wouldn’t expect that to work well without CONFIG_ATH_USER_REGD=y. The whole 5GHz would be off-limits.</p><p>Note that on the current trunk, with CONFIG_ATH_USER_REGD=y, the maximum settable power will be restricted to whatever the card’s CTL-based safe maximum power is on any given channel. Without CONFIG_ATH_USER_REGD=y, the power will still be restricted to the same value, but you won’t see it in iw or iwconfig, it’ll silently be capped to the channel’s maximum.</p><p>My WNDR3700s have the following as their CTL-based power limits:<br />ath0 (AR9223): 25dBm (315mW) across the 2.4GHz band (channels 1-14)<br />ath1 (AR9220) on the 5GHz band:<br />Channels 36-48: 17dBm (50mW)<br />Channels 52-64: 20dBm (100mW)<br />Channels 100-140: 24dBm (250mW)<br />Channels 149-165: 21dBm (125mW)</p><p>Thoughts:</p><p>1. You’re never going to get a transmit power higher than 17dBm on channels 36-48. You might see a higher value there (like 20dBm) in iw or iwconfig, but the card will limit you to 17dBm anyway.</p><p>2. It’s confusing that the maximum power shown by iw and iwconfig takes the CTL limit into account with CONFIG_ATH_USER_REGD=y, but not without it. Without it, the regulatory domain’s power limits overwrite the CTL limits (although the card will still never set a power higher than the CTL limits).</p><p>3. The method that’s used to compute the CTL max power when CONFIG_ATH_USER_REGD=y is set is fragile. There’s a bug that causes the maximum power to be artificially limited to (in my case) 20dBm (100mW) on the 2.4GHz band with ath0 when CONFIG_ATH_USER_REGD=y. This is why I don’t recommend CONFIG_ATH_USER_REGD if you don’t need it. (For example, if you’re in the US and have US-coded cards.)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MarkMentovai</strong> on 2 Dec 2010, 00:33)</p>
