					<p>Several days ago I decided to use WLAN instead of LAN to connect my PC to my Asus WL-500gP (Kamikaze 7.07)</p><p>At first everything seemed to work fine (I set the WLAN to use WPA2-PSK encryption). <br />But everytime I do not use the WLAN for several hours (turning off the PC over night and back on the next morning) connecting to my WLAN fails. So I have to plug in the LAN cable, pull up the WLAN configuration page, restart the WLAN and after that, everything is fine again.</p><p>As you can imagine, this procedure isn&#039;t a solution I can live with.<br />Any idea what can cause this behaviour?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>massaquah</strong> on 22 Aug 2007, 15:49)</p>
