					<p>I installed OpenWRT on TP-Link TL-WR841ND and everything was perfect, I accessed the address 192.168.1.1 without problem. Configured as a bridge, and also everything worked perfect, but now can not access the device by default address 192.168.1.1. What would be the address of access when it is configured as a bridge? Because with this configuration, the bridge, I can no longer change any settings or access the product</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>laomonteiro</strong> on 28 May 2012, 17:24)</p>
