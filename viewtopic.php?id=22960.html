					<p>I&#039;m working on LuCI interface for my portproxy tool. I&#039;m keeping the whole configuration in /etc/config/softwire. I&#039;ve developed LuCI module that allows easy edition of that file.<br />Edition and saving works ok. The only thing I can&#039;t find is how to restart service after user click &quot;save&amp;apply.&quot;. As I understand, LuCI will then call uci commit.</p><p>But how do I force uci (or LuCI) to execute something like &quot;/etc/init.d/portproxy restart&quot;?<br />There&#039; s a good example of what I&#039;am trying to accomplish: port forwarding configuration. Once you modify something and commit the changes, LuCI web is reloaed and&nbsp; &quot;Applying changes&quot; table appears with information regarding firewall and qos restarting. I believe something like:<br />/etc/init.d/firefwall restart<br />/etc/init.d/qos restart</p><p>But how do I make my package to restart once I commit changes to my own configuration?</p><p>Any tips and pointers to the already existing solutions are more than welcome.</p><p>Tomek</p>									</div>

					<div class="quotebox"><cite>jow wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Hi, take a look at /etc/config/ucitrack, this files specifies which services are related to which config files.</p></blockquote></div><p>Thanks for the tip. I&#039;ve added following section to ucitrack:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;softwire&#039;
    option &#039;init&#039; &#039;portproxy&#039;
    list &#039;affects&#039; &#039;portproxy&#039;</code></pre></div><p>but it didn&#039;t help. I&#039;m not sure if the list line is required or not, so I&#039;ve tried both with and without it. When use my LuCI page to update relevant section in my /etc/config/softwire config file, my service is not restarted. </p><p>Here are some extra information that may be helpful:<br />My config file is named softwire (it is located in /etc/config/softwire) and my service script is located at /etc/init.d/portproxy. First, I&#039;ve added this section manually (using vi), which I think is not the &#039;proper&#039; approach, as I should use uci to do that. To make sure that uci recognizes the changes, I&#039;ve exported ucitrack file and imported it back. Right now &#039;uci show ucitrack&#039; displays my changes correctly. </p><p>I&#039;m not sure if that is relevant, but in Makefile for my portproxy package, I have this clause:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>define Package/portproxy/install
...
        $(INSTALL_DIR) $(1)/etc/config 
        $(INSTALL_DATA) ./files/config/softwire $(1)/etc/config/softwire
...
endef

define Package/$(PKG_NAME)/conffiles
/etc/config/softwire
endef</code></pre></div><p>so I think my config file is properly installed and marked as config.</p><p>I don&#039;t know much about uci, so to make sure that there are no caching ivolved, I&#039;ve also restarted my router. Still, it doesn&#039;t work. Making changes to my softwire config doesn&#039;t restart my portproxy service. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, I&#039;ve solved this. I wish this whole UCI+LuCI operation was described in some docs somewhere... Anyway, here are some extra info in case someone else hits the same problem.</p><p>Configuration parameters are expected to be stored in /etc/config/name-of-your-config, in my case it was /etc/config/softwire. Service scripts are located in the usual location /etc/init.d, in my case it was /etc/init.d/portproxy. I also had to add several lines to /etc/config/ucitrack to indicate that /etc/config/softwire config file is associated with portproxy service (/etc/init.d/portproxy file). </p><p>Now, when LuCI webpage commits UCI changes, i.e. when you hit Save&amp;Apply or Apply button, several things happen. Among others, also Cursor.apply() method from luci/model/uci.lua file is called. As&nbsp; a result, external script /sbin/luci-reload is invoked. You can take a closer look, if necessary. In my case the problem was that portproxy service was disabled. It was running (started manually), so I thought it will do the trick. Enabling the service (/etc/init.d/portproxy enable) solved the problem.</p><p>Now it works. JoW, thanks again for your help.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry for dig this old post out.</p><p>What I wonder know is a way to restart a service for all config changes. No matter which config it is, once a config is changed, and be saved and applied, my services would restart.<br />It seems that to add several same lines in the ucitrack is possible.<br />But does ucitrack have support for all config? Or I have to add something in LuCI&#039;s &quot;save &amp; apply&quot; button?</p>									</div>
