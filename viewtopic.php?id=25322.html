					<p>hello everyone! I&#039;m an absolute newbie who has been reading the guide (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/beginner">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/beginner</a>) becasue I wanted to turn my spare ADSL Router (a Comtrend CT-5631) into a Neutral Router in order to connect it to cablemodem and use it for the WiFi (and for connecting my 3 PCs at home)</p><p>Followinf the guide I succesfully installed the OpenWrt firmware. It was horrible to choose which one, but googling it it was decided this: openwrt-96348GW-10-jffs2-64k-bc300-cfe.bin and...it worked.</p><p>But now I&#039;m facing the ordeal of configuring my new CT- 5361 OpenWrt to get the WAN fromt he cable router at one of its 4 ethernet ports and I&#039;m not having any luck.... so I would really appreciate some help to do so <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>If your cable modem uses PPPoE, then you will need to configure your WAN on your OpenWrt router to authenticate to your ISP with your PPPoE username/password.&nbsp; Otherwise, you should just be able to set your WAN to DHCP to automatically obtain an IP address from your ISP.&nbsp; Your LAN should be set to a static IP (usually 192.168.1.1) and act as a DHCP server (to assign your network nodes an IP address automatically).&nbsp; Then you should have internet from any of the 4 ethernet ports.</p>									</div>

					<p>Your OpenWrt router should have a static IP address of 192.168.1.1 by default.&nbsp; You can connect to the router from a client computer via telnet/SSH or HTTP (if you have LuCI or webif installed).&nbsp; Your client computers should be assigned an address via DHCP of 192.168.1.XXX (e.g. 192.168.1.100).</p>									</div>
