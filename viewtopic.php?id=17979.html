					<p>Hi,</p><p>I currently have a D-Link DIR-655 <a href="http://www.dlink.com/products/?pid=530">http://www.dlink.com/products/?pid=530</a>, but the signal is not strong enough to serve my entertainment unit so I want to add a Repeater or WDS.</p><p>I know that OpenWRT doesn&#039;t run on my primary router.&nbsp; What I&#039;d like to know is whether or not I can install OpenWRT on different router (i.e. WRT54GL) and use it as a repeater.&nbsp; So I&#039;ll have the DIR-655 upstairs running the D-Link firmware and connecting to the DSL modem, and the LinkSys WRT54GL downstairs running OpenWRT connected <em>wirelessly</em> to the DIR-655 and re-broadcasting the signal, as well as accepting wired and wireless clients.</p><p>Here&#039;s an ASCII picture of what I was planning:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>                          Internet
