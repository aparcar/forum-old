					<p>Hello,<br />I&#039;m searching for an ipk network analyzer (an Ethereal like), to evaluate some network parameters like packet delay, jitter and packet loss. I installed Iperf, which generates TCP and UDP traffic and is very useful for me, but this application doesn&#039;t tell me any information about packet delay parameter.<br />Do you know any already-packed WRT software?<br />Thank you</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I didn&#039;t know etherape, but I know that using ethereal, is possible post-analyze sniffed packets to make the statistics I need.<br />It appears that is possible to make the same thing with tcpdump, which actually is included in OpenWrt backports. For linux platforms, there is a program called Argus (<a href="http://www.qosient.com/argus/">http://www.qosient.com/argus/</a>) which permits to measure jitter, packet loss and packet delay of sniffed packets just reading tcpdump binary files.<br />Do you know anything about it? I&#039;m googling hard, and I also wrote on tcpdump mailing list.<br />Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>You can tcpdump to a file:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>tcpdump -w /tmp/dump.trace -s 65000 -i eth0</code></pre></div><p>I always use -s 65000 because otherwise tcpdump will only capture packets partitially. Last time I created packet statistics using ethereal, it was not using the actual size of the packets but instead the captured size. My statistics were flawed because of this. Hence the &quot;-s 65000&quot;. I think it&#039;s an Ethereal bug. You might or might not need this.</p><p>After this you just open the trace file with Ethereal.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>keitsi</strong> on 20 Mar 2007, 12:33)</p>
