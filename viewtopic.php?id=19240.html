					<p>I have been trying to build a GRUB2 package for OpenWRT with limited success. You can find the current results of my efforts at</p><p><a href="http://morrowje.googlepages.com/grub2.tgz">http://morrowje.googlepages.com/grub2.tgz</a></p><p>It does not actually install grub2 onto the boot record of any image but merely builds the grub2 tools and installs them on the created image. From there, you&#039;ll have to do the rest manually. I created a script to help out.</p><p>One other issue is the matter of cross-compiling. I am building on 64-bit Ubuntu 8.10 for i386 and the build process errors out.</p><p>I am working on both of these issues but would be glad for any assistance!</p>									</div>
