					<p>Hi there,</p><p>so as Im pretty new to OpenWrt and don&#039;t want to lose senseless time in trying something out without knowing if it will even work, I prefer to ask first, if it is possible to spare my nerves. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>So I own a TP-Link WDR3500 which isn&#039;t by it own firmware certified WiFi-Ready. The problem is I own also a Streaming Stick which supports full Miracast via my Smartphones, which are also full Miracast ready. But it seems the devices have problems connecting with each other, so I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s cause of the router, as it provides me just a clean 802.11n only WPA2 wlan network. I was pretty well with this router, as it is reliable and stable running with a lot of features, except for WiFI Direct, which I never needed before.</p><p>If I see right it is possible to build up kind of mesh networks and also my router is supported by OpenWrt. So simple question, is it possible with OpenWrt to get my router ready for services like WiFi-Direct/Miracast or is it a lost hope and I should invest money in another router ?</p><p>Thanks in advance !</p>									</div>
