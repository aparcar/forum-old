					<p>Hi,<br />I have some problems setting up asecond wifi network on my TL-WR1043ND.</p><p>Here my setup:</p><p>fritzbox 6320 (DS-Lite, does not support bridge mode) --&gt; TL-WR1043ND (usead as AP)</p><p>The only problem I have with this setup ist the wifi. The fritzbox is using Ipv6 including DHCPv6, but Android does not support DHCPv6, so the internet is very slow.</p><p>So either I buy an additional switch and install it between the fritzbox and the WR1043ND or I try to realize a second wifi with openwrt, that isn&#039;t managed by the fritzbox.</p><p>Currently im using Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 over the luci interface. <br />I found description which describes an guest wifi setup with luci and I&#039;ve tried this, just without the firewale restrictions.

					<p>Could you please elaborate a bit more which settings you use and what exactly isn&#039;t working (with regards to IPv6 and IPv4)?</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>Sergej59 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>The only problem I have with this setup ist the wifi.

And I have several Android devices (from Lollipop to Nougat) which work just fine, both over IPv6 and IPv4. My setup is actually quite similar: I have a FritzBox 6490 Cable and a TP-Link router which I use as an access point (so the AP just forwards the DHCP and Router Advertisements from the FritzBox).</p><p>I think you have two issues here. Basically, your IPv4 connection (via DS-Lite) should not be significantly slower than your IPv6 connection. If I do performance measurements, I don&#039;t see much difference between IPv4 and IPv6. I just did a speed test at dslreports.com, the first via IPv4 showed 108.4Mbps downstream and the second test via IPv6 showed 110.1Mbps - so the difference is neglectible. But, of course, results may vary depending on your location, ISP and maybe daytime (more or less traffic). I also have two client devices in my network that run IPv4-only and I hadn&#039;t had any problems with them either - despite DS-Lite. I actually think this issue should your priority, because even if you get IPv6 working on all devices, there are still *a lot* of websites out there that don&#039;t support IPv6, so you would still have that problem with IPv4-only sites.</p><p>The second issue is your IPv6 not working properly, apparently. Actually, I didn&#039;t need to do anything special for that to work on either the FritzBox or my client devices. I think I mostly use the default settings for the IPv6 on LAN on the FritzBox. So, I have DHCPv6 enabled on the FritzBox, but only for DNS advertisements. I let the FritzBox always distribute ULA addresses to all clients, but I&#039;m sure it has been working without them as well (before I turned that on). On my Android devices, I didn&#039;t have to do anything.</p><p>That all being said, if you can&#039;t properly configure your FritzBox (I know boxes received from cable ISPs often lack various features and configuration options), there are other options you have. If you can enable Prefix Delegation on your FritzBox (I think that&#039;s hidden in the &quot;Extended View&quot; and the options you need are &quot;Allow prefixes advertised by other routers&quot; and &quot;Advertise DNS-Server, Prefix (IA_PD) and IPv6-Address (IA_NA)&quot;), then you can put your OpenWrt box in router mode and let OpenWrt handle IPv6 advertisements and negotiations with your clients. For IPv4, your OpenWrt will act as another NAT layer which is not ideal but also not a big deal (if you have DS-Lite you probably won&#039;t be running any servers in your home network that you want to access over the internet and IPv4 anyway).</p><p>If you can&#039;t enable Prefix Delegation, things get more complicated, but you are not lost either. Not too long ago, I had a cable gateway that was controlled by the ISP with only little left to configure on my own. So, I put my own TP-Link router behind that. But since the cable gateway didn&#039;t support Prefix Delegation, I had to use NAT6 (NAT on IPv6). This is rarely used, because it&#039;s somewhat against the design goals of IPv6. However, it is possible (and standardized) and it worked well for me for quite some time. I actually wrote a wiki entry on how to set that up:<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/ipv6.nat6">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/ipv6.nat6</a></p><p>Good luck!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>silentcreek</strong> on 15 Sep 2016, 14:54)</p>
