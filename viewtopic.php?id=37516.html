					<p>I&#039;ve successfully manually setup IPv6 6rd from my home DSL link to Qwest/Centurylink , and I want to integrate the manual configuration changes so that they will survive reboot / ip address change, get to be visible on via luci , get ip6tables working etc.</p><p>First off - what I&#039;ve done... </p><p>Century Link have announced 6rd support via the simple UI on a subset of their devices (just one currently published, but i found some more on a gamma test site with google searches - so I think there are more coming.)</p><p>=========================<br />#!/bin/sh</p><p>MYIPADDRESS=N.N.N.N</p><p>CLINKPREFIX=&quot;2602&quot;<br />CLINKLENGTH=24<br />CLINK6RDNODE=205.171.2.64</p><p>LANINTF=br-lan<br />WANINTF=pppoe-wan</p><p>V6IPADDR=$(printf &quot;$CLINKPREFIX:%02x:%02x%02x:%02x00::1\n&quot; $(echo $MYIPADDRESS | tr . &#039; &#039;))</p><p>if [ -n &quot;$V6IPADDR&quot; ]; then<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ip tunnel del 6rd<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ip addr add $V6IPADDR/64 dev br-lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ip tunnel add 6rd mode sit local $MYIPADDRESS ttl 64<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ip tunnel 6rd dev 6rd 6rd-prefix $CLINKPREFIX::/$CLINKLENGTH<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ip addr add $V6IPADDR/$CLINKLENGTH dev 6rd<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ip link set 6rd up<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ip route add ::/0 via ::$CLINK6RDNODE dev $WANINTF</p><p>fi</p><p>=========================</p><br /><p>I can run this on my device ; and 6rd work... however I want to set it up so that this script is integrated into interface transitions - so that when I reboot, or interfaces transition - and my external IP is updated - that the computed 6rd address is correct. </p><p>So I&#039;m looking for guidance on where I need to integrate this into the openwrt environment. I also need to update my radvd config - which I haven&#039;t got to yet - because my lan already has v6 on it from sixxs</p><p>Also - what other things should be integrated ? luci doesn&#039;t display the IPv6 data - presumably because it&#039;s looking for v6 addresses on my $WANINTF and is completely unaware of the 6rd interface I created.</p><p>So I&#039;m looking for pointers to documentation / examples of other people having done the same thing ... rather than having to reinvent the wheel ..</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>chrishig</strong> on 15 Jun 2012, 04:27)</p>
