					<p>Hello,<br />I am currently getting rather poor wifi performance.<br />The configuration is a RouterBoard 532A (400MHz MIPS board) running 2.6.19.2/Kamikaze 6529.&nbsp; The router performs excellently over Ethernet.</p><p>The wireless card is this Atheros-based card:<br /><a href="http://www.titanwirelessonline.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=MP%2DWLMAG%2DS23">http://www.titanwirelessonline.com/Prod â€¦ LMAG%2DS23</a></p><p>The antennas are two 5.5 dbi omnidirectional antennas.</p><p>The system is running a WPA/WPA2 access point with three stations: one Ralink USB station and two Intel 3945abg stations.&nbsp; All are indoor within 20ft. of the AP. They all report strong signal strength, yet performance is rather poor.&nbsp; Transfer speeds are often slow and the clients often go into a state where they still appear to be connected yet no longer function.</p><p>I have tried all sorts of different channels...</p><p>However, the card itself reports rather low signal quality:<br />ath0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IEEE 802.11g&nbsp; ESSID:&quot;Erased&quot;&nbsp; Nickname:&quot;&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mode:Master&nbsp; Frequency:2.417 GHz&nbsp; Access Point: 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bit Rate:0 kb/s&nbsp; &nbsp;Tx-Power=8 dBm&nbsp; &nbsp;Sensitivity=0/3&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Retry:off&nbsp; &nbsp;RTS thr:off&nbsp; &nbsp;Fragment thr:off<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Encryption key: [2]&nbsp; &nbsp;Security mode:open<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Power Management:off<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Link Quality=43/94&nbsp; Signal level=-52 dBm&nbsp; Noise level=-95 dBm<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rx invalid nwid:11099&nbsp; Rx invalid crypt:0&nbsp; Rx invalid frag:0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tx excessive retries:0&nbsp; Invalid misc:0&nbsp; &nbsp;Missed beacon:0</p><p>The </p><p>I have no problems with the same clients running a Broadcom-based AP.</p><p>Any ideas?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;ve got the same problem. Me too, I&#039;ve got a rb532a and a WLM54AG wireless card.&nbsp; The router performs excellently over Ethernet but the WiFi slows down incredibly.&nbsp; Sorry fdl4, I can&#039;t help you, but I just wanted to say that your problem isn&#039;t isolated.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>t.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well I have a similar problem, BUT while it does happen on machines as different as Wrap-2E (x86) and WGT643U (Broadcom) both having Atheros cards, I have also seen similar this same &quot;going into a state where they still appear to be connected but no longer function&quot; on ethernet.&nbsp; The 634U had an Atheros card on it, but it was not being used, and running from a LAN port to the WAN it would run for say 30 minutes, then stop for 10 and back for an hour and gone for 5.&nbsp; No pattern, but faily random.&nbsp; The box was not running anything more than it had to.&nbsp; There is another forum item option about this but it got no reply.</p>									</div>

					<p>As explains David Goodenough (here: <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=11921)">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=11921)</a> it could be a diversity problem and in fact I&#039;ve got only one connector on my wireless card. I will try to fix this parameter in /etc/config/wireless file and check if the performance increase or not. Thank to David Goodenough for his experience share.</p><p>regards,</p><p>t.</p>									</div>
