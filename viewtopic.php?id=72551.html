					<p>I have flashed openwrt in my TL-WR741ND v4, while flashing suddenly power on my area tripped. The router still powers up, only PWR and QSS LEDs(Padlock icon) are light up. I have tried this tftp solution (see link) but nothing happens. The tftp server reverts back to 127.0.0.1(local host) instead of 192.168.0.66.&nbsp; I&#039;m running on Windows 10 64bit desktop PC with LAN port. I&#039;m using this TFTP server v4.60 64bit edition. I hope that this&nbsp; guy will get fixed. Thanks.<br /><strong><br />tftp solution:</strong><br />Set up a tftp server on your PC and verify if it works correctly (configuration, permissions, firewalls, etc.)<br />Rename your target firmware to wr740v4_tp_recovery.bin and copy it to your base folder (by default /tftpboot). I tested with openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr740n-v4-squashfs-factory.bin r43602.<br />Set up the following static IP for your PC: 192.168.0.66/255.255.255.0. If you&#039;re not sure about the firmware name on a different model, start a packet sniffer on your PC (tcpdump -i eth0 -n -l) and look for the name in the RRQ message.<br />Preferably disconnect WAN from the router<br />Connect the PC to a LAN port<br />Power off the router<br />Press and hold the reset button<br />Power on the router<br />After the leftmost (power) LED and the rightmost (padlock) LED turn on alone in a few seconds, release the reset button<br />The router will now identify as 192.168.0.86, finish upgrading using its built-in tftp client and reboot in less than half a minute. In case of failure, it retries multiple times and gives up in about 5-10 seconds to resume normal booting. No configuration is erased, so it&#039;s safe to experiment. OpenWRT will need to finish initialization on first/second startup if that&#039;s what you are installing</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>aldreezy</strong> on 15 Nov 2017, 03:47)</p>

					<p>Connect an ethernet switch between the router and the PC so the PC does not have the connection drop and reset its port when the router is turned off.&nbsp; The switch would be always powered on.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t have a switch you can also use two LAN ports on any other router that stays powered on.</p>									</div>
