					<p>I am a (not-advanced) user of both Mikrotik RouterOS L5 (on their Routerboards, not on x86) and of OpenWrt (on TP-Link WDR-4300).<br />I love both OpenWrt and RouterOS but to be honest both feature and stability-wise Mikrotik stands out. Also the GUI is superior. Performance is not bad on either, but is hard to compare against dissimilar hardware platforms.&nbsp; <br />The only clear advantage on the OpenWRT side is the flexibility offered by the huge number of optional packages (some of them being responsible for somewhat lower OpenWRT stability).<br />I noticed in the supported Hardware that a number of Mikrotik RouterBoards have OpenWRT developed for, I was wondering what would be the reasons to switch to OpenWrt for a board which comes bundled with RouterOS:<br />-is the flexibility of OpenWRT optional packages<br />-is the missing features of RouterOS &lt;L3 set on some boards ?<br />-maybe the better compatibility when all routers in your environment are running the same OS (OpenWRT) ?</p><p>I think is a no-brainer to replace the vendor stock firmware of most routers with OpenWrt or DD-WRT but I&#039;m still hesitating when is about RouterOS, specifically &gt;=Level4 feature set.</p><p>What is your opinion on this ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Actually it&#039;s more complicated.</p><p>Mikrotik does offer some advantages in specific usage scenarios, e.g. if you&#039;re a WISP and want to deploy a PtMP network over an area of tens of square Kms. Or if you&#039;re more comfortable with a Windows app for configuration (Winbox). But on the other hand, ROS is weak -even problematic- in several areas, including VPN support.</p><p>OpenWRT offers a more or less standard Linux system, using popular tools for DNS, DHCP, SSH etc. Most/all the Linux skills you&#039;ve learned over the years are readily transferable to OpenWRT.</p>									</div>
