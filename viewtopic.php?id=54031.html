					<p>I have a TL-WR841N V8 running OpenWrt. It works in PPPoE mode coupled with a ZTE ZXDSL modem in bridge mode.</p><p>The ZTE modem does not turn the Internet LED on because it only works as a bridge. And the WAN led on the WR841N turns on when Ethernet connection is established - it doesn&#039;t matter if the Internet is connected or not.</p><p>The WPS led is always off, and I wanted to know if there&#039;s a way to make it turn on when Internet is connected and working. I tried googling but couldn&#039;t make use of anything I found.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Quite easy to do with a little shell script. The following is assuming you are running Barrier Breaker 14.07:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

LED=&quot;/sys/devices/platform/leds-gpio/leds/wd:blue:power&quot;
LED_TRIGGER=&quot;netdev&quot;
LED_DEVICENAME=&quot;pppoe-wan&quot;
LED_MODE=&quot;link tx rx&quot;

[ &quot;$INTERFACE&quot; = &quot;wan&quot; ] || exit 0

if [ &quot;$ACTION&quot; = &quot;ifup&quot; ] ; then
        echo 255 &gt; $LED/brightness
        echo $LED_TRIGGER &gt; $LED/trigger
        echo $LED_DEVICENAME &gt; $LED/device_name
        echo $LED_MODE &gt; $LED/mode
elif [ &quot;$ACTION&quot; = &quot;ifdown&quot; ] ; then
        echo 0 &gt; $LED/brightness
fi</code></pre></div><p>Replace the LED variable with the LED you want to light up, replace LED_DEVICENAME with the network device attached to wan (for me it&#039;s pppoe-wan, probably for you, too). Name the file &quot;90-wanled&quot; and drop it into /etc/hotplug.d/iface/</p><p>Not only does it light up the LED, it attaches the netdev trigger so it will blink happily if there&#039;s traffic on the interface.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 15 Nov 2014, 17:12)</p>

					<p>That worked perfectly, thank you!</p><p>Just one more thing, just out of curiosity: what should I changed if I wanted it to *not* blink when there&#039;s traffic on the interface? ON when connected, OFF when not and that&#039;s it?</p><p>Again, thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>That&#039;s even simpler to do. You could delete most of the script and just set brightness ... or just reconfigure it:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>LED_TRIGGER=&quot;none&quot;</code></pre></div><p>I just noticed that the order the settings are applied is not ideal. Please do also change the order to:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>        echo $LED_TRIGGER &gt; $LED/trigger
        echo $LED_DEVICENAME &gt; $LED/device_name
        echo $LED_MODE &gt; $LED/mode
        echo 255 &gt; $LED/brightness</code></pre></div><p>(i.e. move the brightness setting to the bottom. This is necessary because if the trigger is changed from something else to &quot;none&quot;, it seems to erase a previously set brightness setting.)</p>									</div>
