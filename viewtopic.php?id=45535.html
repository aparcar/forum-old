					<p>If you read <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/netifd#dependencies.of.netifd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/net … .of.netifd</a></p><p>it seems like there is an entire suite as alternative to glib/D-Bus/udev+systemd </p><p>I do not know, but most probably there is a point for this on systems with 16, 32 or 64MB of main memory. Is there a point for it on mobile devices, which nowadays come with 512MB and more of main memory?</p><p>Unhappy with the integration of systemd in Debian I simply tried Fedora 19 with GNOME and NetworkManager (unetwork), PulseAudio (usound) and systemd work out-of-the-box without sound glitches or configuration annoyances ;-) Yay!</p><p>I also like systemctl and journalctl.</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/procd">procd</a> seems to be an alternative to systemd (replaced initd, replaced klogd and syslogd, etc)<br />1. what is the point? Is there a point on systems with 512MB and more of main memory?<br />2. how about some better documentation? biggrin</p>									</div>

					<p>Given the fact that there are still new routers shipping in 2013 with 32M ram and 4M flash it makes sense to develop this tiny alternatives.</p><p>From a development pov, when setting resource constraints aside, it would still take us more effort to modify dbus to do what we want than it took to write ubus, netifd and the related libraries from scratch.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, that is about the answer I expected. ;-)</p><p>Now that the work is done, how about using it on &quot;Low end borderline smartphones&quot; with &quot;only&quot; 512MB of main memory instead of the alternatives? Good? Bad?</p><p>What about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_TV">&quot;Smart&quot;-TV</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-vehicle_infotainment">In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI)</a>, my washing machine&nbsp; or other electronic devices with low main memory?</p><p><strong>Do people who would see a point in this approach even know about the existence of Luci2?</strong> How to spread the word?</p><p>I am somebody who hates the fact, that I can connect a harddisc to my Samsung &quot;smart&quot;-TV (which runs some Linux), but this harddisc has be formated with NTFS, because the &quot;smart-TV&quot; does not recognize ext4-partitioned harddisc. :-( Patented CODECs are not a problem, the TV software just plays anything as long as it is located on a NTFS-formated device ;-)</p>									</div>

					<p>Desktop distributions carry around a lot of legacy stuff (Debian........), this slows down the adoption of new software designs (systemd, Wayland, etc) and thus also the development, since development requires an active user-base.</p><p>Operating systems for Mobile devices could/should be able to deliver much faster development of code and system/software design by dropping all the legacy stuff. Sadly their closed, so they got no active user-base!</p><p>OpenWrt on the other hand, is pretty cool. It seems to be the most free of legacy stuff. So, could the efforts of Luci2 be re-used?</p><p>Yes, only someone actually working on a system for this hardware devices can decide that, but in order to do so, they would have to know about the existence of Luci2. You get my point?</p>									</div>
