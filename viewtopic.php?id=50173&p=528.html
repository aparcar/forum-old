About the backup config file pleas don&#039;t flash a old backup config file as you mite really mess things up. I have dun this and it&#039;s a pane in the ass. The davidc502 build mite have a small change in it that will not like a setting in the backup and then will throw it all off. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
