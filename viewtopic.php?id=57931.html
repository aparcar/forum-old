					<p>If anybody needs an industrial grade (-40°C to 85°C) embedded board with 4 Mini PCI interfaces please let me know. I have several Avila Gateworks GW2348-4 left from a previous project.</p><p><a href="http://www.gateworks.com/product/item/avila-gw2348-4-network-processor">http://www.gateworks.com/product/item/a … -processor</a></p><p>There&#039;s a customized Linux OS installed called StarOS (<a href="http://www.staros.com">www.staros.com</a>) with good support for Atheros MiniPCI cards. It&#039;s a pretty good and stable router operating system. I used it a lot. But I also used OpenWRT on this boards and have experience how to install OpenWRT.</p><p>Kind regards,<br />Franz</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Sulaman,</p><p>I can sell you a single board for EUR 50 plus shipping costs. Price is lower if you buy more than one.</p><p>Unfortunately I don&#039;t know the NETKROM software and can&#039;t help you with the installation. The boards come with a software called StarOS V3 (<a href="http://www.star-os.com">www.star-os.com</a>). Maybe this software has the features that you need.</p><p>Kind regards,<br />Franz</p>									</div>
