Fortunately for you, &quot;forum2006&quot; has posted a very good howto on the topic. The post relates to a WL-700gE Encore. As far as I know, the only difference between a WL-700gE Encore and a regular WL-700gE is the size of the harddrive. So whatever your model is, you should be fine with this howto.<br />Have a look at <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=57160">this post</a> for detailed instructions.<br />You reached point 2 of the howto.</p>									</div>

The guide refers to a 2.4 kernel (with Wifi).<br />Kamikaze uses <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/KamikazeConfiguration">UCI</a> for its configuration and not the NVRAM. Anyhow, if you press the reset button for 10 seconds, the content of the NVRAM will be restored to factory default.</p>									</div>
