					<p>I said I keep you posted. Since last time I spent maybe another 15 hours on my 4.7 port.

615-netfilter_add_xt_id_match.patch</code></pre></div><p>Those are those rare patches that can stick in generic for a while longer, thou it&#039;s ugly to rely on 615 as it makes firewall3 pretty much useless anywhere else. Of course backports from released kernels are fine as well <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Wireless dropped even further on the priority list. I had it working once with vanilla hostapd when getting netifd out of the way. Though no performance testing was done.</p><p>Stuff of interest right now:<br />- missing RENAME_WHITEOUT and RENAME_EXCHANGE support in ubifs<br />- ubiblock applet missing in busybox<br />- reasonable initramfs support in openwrt</p><p>Other pending stuff:<br />- fix ledtrig-usb to not depend on kernel hack.<br />- crda package?<br />- wireless</p><p>@gsustek, lsusb from busybox works again, also there is a ledtrig-libata already (patch 8xx in generic) that you might want to test instead of the one from me.</p>									</div>

					<p>I know this may have been covered already in this thread, I have LEDE WRT installed and after help from SHM0, I got the items I needed installed. I installed the 9K and 10K ath for WLAN and they seem to be installed ok, however the Drop Down options boxes for the Operation of the modes and such are blank. Before installing LEDE WRT, I had OpenWRT installed using the default stable CC build for the WRT1900ACv1 the other day and I did see drop down menu options listed. There a known issue with this on LEDE? Any status or information would be appreciated.</p>									</div>
