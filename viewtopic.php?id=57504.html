					<p>When using gw6c, is it possible to specifiy which DNS resolvers are sent with router advertisements?</p><p>Normally, you would add config to /etc/config/radvd like so:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config rdnss
        option interface        &#039;lan&#039;
        list   addr             &#039;2001:db8:1::4&#039;
        list   addr             &#039;2001:db8:2::5&#039;
        # option AdvRDNSSLifetime 3600
        option ignore           0</code></pre></div><p>However gw6c doesn&#039;t use that radvd config, instead generating it&#039;s own. Is there a way to override that?</p>									</div>

					<p>I solved my problem by editing <em>/usr/share/gw6c/template/openwrt.sh</em> and adding necessary config there. That scripts gets run each time gw6c starts.</p><p>I also realised that, by default, router advertisements contain the IPv6 address of the router&#039;s LAN interface as a DNS esolver, which works too. For most people, this will be all they need!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>porjo</strong> on 23 May 2015, 03:54)</p>
