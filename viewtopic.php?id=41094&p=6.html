					<p>Hi, AdamK! Thanks for your work! I have downloaded your r39894 firmware , and try to flash this image directly from the stock Netgear firmware for WNDR3700V4. But it reports that the firmware is incorrect. (But the firmware for WNDR3700V4 built by rpsoft can be flashed successfully!) I find that r39894 firmware is built for WNDR4300 not for WNDR3700V4, could you build firmware for WNDR3700V4 and share it in this post for us? Thank you!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>min_x91</strong> on 30 Mar 2014, 04:11)</p>
