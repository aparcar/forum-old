					<p>Hi everybody.</p><p>We are studying how to accelerate the HTTP traffic. In fact we wanted to work with a UMTS-3G connection but the Linksys G3G is still in a WIP status.<br />First of all we wanted to change the HTTP headers in order to reduce the size of the packets on the net. Do you know if there is a module which capture the HTTP packets??<br />I&#039;ve thought about some kind of proxy but I&#039;m not quite sure...</p><p>(we wanted to eliminate the profile characteristics like : ACCEPT MIME...&nbsp; ACCEPT text\plain... because we are supposing that we are going to have a Server with all the profiles on it, and it will be this server which will restore all the headers before sending to the Inet Server)</p><p>Thanks for reading!!</p>									</div>
