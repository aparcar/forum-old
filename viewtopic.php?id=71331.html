					<p>I&#039;m looking for some hardware to support a project. Basically act as an AP &amp; switch for some local devices &amp; get upstream Internet access (if available) via a directional antenna. Basically for some events such as RVing or HAM radio field day where you are just out of WiFi range for normal devices. I haven&#039;t had any luck filtering through the Table of Hardware to find something that matches my needs.</p><p>Requirements:<br /></p><ul><li><p>Dual radios so it can act as an AP &amp; client at the same time<br />5ish Ethernet ports for local access (more are better, could probably get by with 4)<br />Removable CF or SD card so you don&#039;t have to fiddle with PXE or what not to flash a new image on it if you brick it<br />Console port, preferably one I don&#039;t have to solder in<br />Flexible voltage requirements (a.k.a. it will likely end up running off a car battery running around 12v give or take a few volts)</p></li></ul><p>I&#039;ve got some various PCengines gear, but it&#039;s low on switch ports. Soekris seems to be out of business in the US. I was looking at some of the MicroTik gear, but it&#039;s short a 2nd radio &amp; the removable flash drive.</p><p>Should I try something like one of the MicroTik devices &amp; use a USB WiFi NIC for the 2nd radio? I can solder in a console port &amp; suffer through PXE stuff if there aren&#039;t semi-reasonably priced or available options, but I&#039;d prefer not to.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks. I remember being kind of excited about the Turris Omnia a year or so ago, then forgot about it. It looks like it naively has 2 radios in it already. Doesn&#039;t precisely match my requirements, but it&#039;s got enough ease of management functions to make recovery easy.</p>									</div>

					<p>Got the Turris Omina a couple days ago. So far it seems to be everything I was hoping for. Easy to recover &amp; re-flare if needed, dual radio to provide a local AP while connecting to a remote signal. Really happy with it running OpenWRT stock.</p>									</div>

					<p>Nearly all wifi drivers allow you to run one or more APs and a clients at the same time on the same radio.&nbsp; The main limitation is that if the client loses its link, the AP will go off the air. This can be worked around with a script that disables the client until its AP is found in a scan.</p><p>Dual radios generally means dual band (2.4 and 5).</p><p>Later ath9k hardware is quite power efficient.&nbsp; For example I have a TP-Link WA-701 by actual measurement uses 60 mA at 12 volts, and is rated to go down to 9 so it is a good candidate to connect directly to a battery.&nbsp; The WR-741 with 5 ports is likely similar.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ya, just because you can doesn&#039;t mean you should. I was specifically looking for 2 unique radios to keep things seperate. It also means I can hook up a directional antenna to one radio for the uplink &amp; a small Omni(s) to the other for the local AP.</p><p>Happy with the setup on the Turris. Still trying to sort out antennas. Going to ditch the duplexers &amp; just put the 2.4/5 radio straight into the stock antennas. Putting in 2 u.fl to SMA connectors on the 2.4 only radio. Either going to out a&nbsp; single normal directional antenna or maybe a cheap MIMO antenna on that.</p>									</div>
