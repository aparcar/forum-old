					<p>Hi guys, </p><p>I looked here and there for PCB images of TP-Link TL-MR11U, but did not find any.... so I decide to open mine and to take some photos:<br />A new toy, I like it more than TL-WR703N one <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />, because it have internal battery I do not need to modify WR703 now. It has better exposure on some of the GPIO pins 4+1 Leds + OSS and Reset Buttons. I have not played yet with GPIO. It will be easy to solder these GPIO than on WR703N<br />I want to mode first&nbsp; 4M flash and put 8M instead, and 32M RAM to 64M RAM. the only thing that is not very clear if I&#039;ll manage to put new Uboot? </p><p>On the 4 led side there is enough space to easily add antenna connector and will still have space left for connector for UART and some of the GPIO&#039;s....</p><p>It will can become ultimate penetration testing device! Chip inside is AR9331; FLASH - 4M - S24FL032P (32-Mbit CMOS 3.0 Volt Flash Memory with 104-MHz SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) Multi I/O Bus) - 8-pin SO package (208 mils); MEMORY - 32M - ZENTEL A3S56D40FTP-G5 - TSOP66</p><p>Battery life is very good. I need to do more test to say how much time exactly will last ( yesterday with standard firmware - acting like WAN-AP, no USB attached it was running all afternoon on battery power )</p><p>So here is some info:</p><p>[s]I&#039;ll upload more photos when I&#039;m back later today.[/s]<br />Wha is in the box:</p><p>Main Unit TL-MR11U Hardware ver.1.1, Battery 3.7V/2000mAh, USB wire, Power supply.</p><p>Front View: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12258575/TP-MR11U/20120328_003.jpg">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12258575/TP-MR1 … 28_003.jpg</a><br />Back View: Battery compartment: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12258575/TP-MR11U/20120328_002.jpg">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12258575/TP-MR1 … 28_002.jpg</a><br />Open top cover it have improvised cooling of SoC and Power converter as well:) <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12258575/TP-MR11U/20120328_007.jpg">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12258575/TP-MR1 … 28_007.jpg</a><br />Close top view: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12258575/TP-MR11U/20120328_006.jpg">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12258575/TP-MR1 … 28_006.jpg</a><br />AR9331 view one: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12258575/TP-MR11U/20120328_009.jpg">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12258575/TP-MR1 … 28_009.jpg</a><br />AR9331 view two: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12258575/TP-MR11U/20120328_021.jpg">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12258575/TP-MR1 … 28_021.jpg</a><br />AR9331 view three: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12258575/TP-MR11U/20120328_024.jpg">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12258575/TP-MR1 … 28_024.jpg</a><br />DC converter and other logic close-up: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12258575/TP-MR11U/20120328_025.jpg">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12258575/TP-MR1 … 28_025.jpg</a><br />Top view: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12258575/TP-MR11U/20120328_018.jpg">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12258575/TP-MR1 … 28_018.jpg</a><br />Bottom view: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12258575/TP-MR11U/20120328_012.jpg">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12258575/TP-MR1 … 28_012.jpg</a><br />Bottom view close-up connectors: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12258575/TP-MR11U/20120328_013.jpg">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12258575/TP-MR1 … 28_013.jpg</a><br />LEDs, Antenna and TX,RX,GND,VCC connection: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12258575/TP-MR11U/20120328_022.jpg">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12258575/TP-MR1 … 28_022.jpg</a> <br />From the letf to right view,the UART pin sequence is:TX,RX,GND,VCC (Square pad is TX) - not checked by me! <br />Possible external antenna connector position: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12258575/TP-MR11U/20120328_026.jpg">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12258575/TP-MR1 … 28_026.jpg</a><br />With subtitles <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12258575/TP-MR11U/20120328_023.jpg">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12258575/TP-MR1 … 28_023.jpg</a></p><p>Sorry for bad quality pictures, but my N900 is kind-a bad digital camera. </p><p>Hack-with-OpenWRT!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mveplus</strong> on 28 Mar 2012, 09:05)</p>

					<p>Nice pics, thanks for that, saves me taking mine apart now. I was hoping there would be space for a similar internal hub and flash drive mod like I did on my 703, but doesn&#039;t really look like it.<br />External aerial connector looks good though in that space you pointed out. Should make a nice pen test device, what are you planning to run on it?
