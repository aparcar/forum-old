					<p>I bought a DIR-601 refurb on Newegg for $13.99, and received the B1 hardware revision.&nbsp; I installed the binary that jay0lee compiled in <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=33231&amp;p=2">this thread</a>, and it worked, although I had no web server running.&nbsp; I then followed the instructions to get Luci installed using opkg, but it failed because there was not enough room on my root partition (most space assigned to /tmp for some reason).&nbsp; So, I decided to go back to the stock firmware image using &quot;mtd -r write dlinkfw.bin firmware&quot;, and it reported that it failed to erase block(s).&nbsp; Subsequent reboots result in nothing but an amber power light and no accessibility.</p><p>Is it dead?&nbsp; I&#039;d love some help recovering this, if any hope exists.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; Before I saw your reply, I did a 30/30/30 reset on it again, and I was able to get to the D-Link recovery interface at 192.168.0.1.&nbsp; I re-flashed OpenWRT from there (it wouldn&#039;t take the latest D-Link FW for B1 for some reason), and I&#039;m back in business with a bash prompt.</p><p>So, I&#039;m quite willing to proceed with OpenWRT if I can get the web interface working, or find a tutorial for building a simple access point with it via command line (no routing, no NAT, just an AP with the LAN ports bridged into the same VLAN).</p>									</div>
