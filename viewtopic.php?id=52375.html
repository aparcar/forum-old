					<p>Hello,<br />I have following setup:</p><p>router A - TL-WR741ND with original firmware acting as AP for rest of wifi clients - it has 192.168.0.0/24<br />router B - TL-WR1043ND v1 as client to router A with OpenWRT AA 12.09 + extroot - local lan is 10.1.2.0/24, there is NAT<br />router C - TL-WR1043ND v2 as AP for other wlan clients with original firmware, tested with OpenWRT BB</p><p>Problem description:<br />when wifi clients connects to router C, connection between router A and B slows down from 108 mbit MCS5 40MHz to 1 Mbit MCS0 20MHz</p><p>When lan clients get connected to lan ports on router C - no decrease of speed is observed as described above.</p><p>The same think happens when I add router D which currently is D-Link dir635. Wifi connected clients affects connection speed between router B and A. </p><p>I suspect that problem is with MSS clamping - enabling - disabling on router B doesn&#039;t change anything.</p><p>I was suspecting Fragmentation threshold - when on router C I had OpenWRT BB I was playing with this parameter but without results. Now with TP-link firmware on Router C I can&#039;t change this parameter. </p><p>I was trying to modify many different parameters affecting firewall but no luck.</p>									</div>
