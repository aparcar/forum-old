					<p>I tried to port a package (cmake based) to OpenWRT. However, its <em>CMakeLists.txt</em> file includes the following scripts to disable the <em>in-source</em> build. I can create a simple patch to remove the scripts and be done with it. However, there are a whole lot more cmake based packages out there that implement such an <em>out-of-source</em> build. Therefore, it certainly will make more sense to learn how to taylor an OpenWRT Makefile for the package to comply with the <em>out-of-source</em> build. If any cmake experts here can lend some hands, I certainly will appreciate that.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#
