					<p>OK, I can confirm that OpenWRT works on this device!!&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve programmed up about 5 of them so far.&nbsp; &nbsp; I have even built from sources on the chaos calmer branch.</p><p>1 caveat is that for this to work, an SDcard MUST BE inserted.&nbsp; &nbsp;It doesn&#039;t have to be a large card.&nbsp; &nbsp;1 gig will do.</p><p>1st thing is to upgrade the firmware to the latest release from Ravpower which is 2.000.040.&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;m going to assume you all can find it, it&#039;s on the Ravpower website.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have not tried upgrading to OpenWRT before 1st upgrading to .040, so best to do that.</p><p>Once you have upgraded to 2.000.040, you can proceed with the OpenWRT installation.&nbsp; &nbsp; It&#039;s actually fairly easy.</p><p>I discovered that the Hardware is essentially identical to the HooToo TM-05.&nbsp; &nbsp; The RP-WD03 only has 32MB of memory, where the TM-05 has 64 MB of memory.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I believe that this difference is why the RP-WD03 needs to have the SD card.</p><p>The firmware will not upgrade unless the card is inserted.&nbsp; &nbsp; And after upgraded to OpenWRT, it will not boot up unless the SD card is inserted.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So put it in there, and keep it in there.</p><p>Follow the instructions on the HooToo TM-05 OpenWRT page:</p><p>&nbsp; OK guys, for some reason I&#039;m not allowed to post links.&nbsp; &nbsp; Google search on this:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;openwrt hootoo tm-05</p><p>The 1st hit should be good.</p><p>Scroll down to the bottom of the page and follow the directions under &quot;WIP OpenWRT Install&quot;.<br />I used ubuntu linux as my tftp server.&nbsp; &nbsp; I set it up so that the TFTP Server messages were shown in syslog.<br />I did a tail -f on /var/log/syslog to monitor the activity going on with TFTP.</p><p>When I saw the messages start up requesting rootfs, I waited about another 30 seconds, and then powered off.<br />I powered on, and OpenWRT came up.&nbsp; &nbsp; Homepage was accessible at 192 168 1 1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You&#039;ve got to put a password on using LuCI, and then ssh is available at the same address.</p><p>For the more ambitious builders out there you can build from these sources:</p><p>github dott comm Slash domino-team Slash openwrt-cc</p><p>Evidently the hardware is also 100% compatible with the GL-MT300N</p><p>I would like to post my diffconfig, but this editor is not allowing me.<br />I will see what I can figure out in a subsequent posting.</p><p>Basis of the configuration is:</p><p>Target System&nbsp; (Ralink RT288x/RT3xxx)<br />Subtarget (MT7620 based boards)<br />Target Profile (GL-MT300N)<br />Enable LuCI<br />Enable LuaSockets&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (note I only needed this for my app)</p><p>Good luck!!&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve had great success with this device.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Please ask if you have questions.</p><p>I can answer 1 question up front:&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve no idea how to get back to the original Ravpower firmware.&nbsp; &nbsp; Haven&#039;t tried, and not going to.</p><p>SeeYa OutThere!</p>									</div>

					<p>I do confirm that it&#039;s possible to flash OpenWrt to RP-WD03.<br />Instructions for flashing located here:<br />wiki.openwrt.org/toh/hootoo/hootoo_ht-tm05<br />I used newer firmware version 2.264 instead specified v.1.0:<br />gl-inet.com/firmware/mt300n/clean/openwrt-gl-mt300n-clean-2.264.bin<br />According to readme: &quot;clean&quot; contains a clean firmware with minimal packages, with LuCI installed (for my luck!), wifi is disabled by default.<br />Initially I burned older Ravpower firmware 2.000.040 (I was trying to get SD-card slot working) thru native web-interface, and then flashed OpenWrt via Tftpd64.<br />But, surprise! <br />USB-port is out of operation. Nobody told about...<br />The reason for experiment was SD-card slot dead. Now USB-port is lost also.<br />Next step, before throwing to trash-bin, will be the device disassembling, I guess...</p>									</div>

					<p>to <strong>mouda3</strong><br />1. There is no dedicated OpenWrt build for this device. Loogatee told that he did, but nobody have seen.<br />2. Which specs? There is no detailed official specs. Wikidevi page is says nothing about memory capacity. Meminfo<br />command says - 28872 kB total.<br />3. No it doesn&#039;t.
