					<p>169.254.0.0/16 are addresses assigned automatically by your computer if it&#039;s configured for DHCP, but can&#039;t obtain a DHCP lease from a server. Which means when the router is booted normally, it is unreachable from your local network for some reason, so there&#039;s probably something wrong with your settings, since failsafe work.</p><p>Please configure your router as desired, and if the problem reappears, boot into failsafe and post your /etc/config/network and /etc/config/dhcp, for starters.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, one thing I was wrong, I got the wrong IP to set manually (192.168.0.1 instead of 192.168.1.1) so now I can get to the router but the DHCP isn&#039;t working.<br />Any general steps to preform for checking the DHCP?</p>									</div>
