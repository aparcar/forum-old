					<p>Hi there</p><p>I have a Netgear WNDR4300. It has 128MB of NAND RAM.</p><p>However, the BB firmware on the website only gives the user access to 16MB of NAND.</p><p>So I pulled the OpenWRT source and followed the buildroot guide and out comes the firmware.</p><p>It is named okay &quot;openwrt-ar71xx-nand-wndr4300-ubi-factory.img&quot;</p><p>But when I try to sysupgrade I get the platform_check_image failed error. Also similiar issue in Luci.</p><p>However when I check the current existing firmware&#039;s /tmp/sysinfo I get wndr4300 and NETGEAR WNDR4300 for boardname and model respectively.</p><p>I just wonder how can I verify the firmware I have generated is correct for the router other than the filename? (I rather figure this out rather than force flash something that is not kosher and then have to TFTP. A bit pain in the butt since Ethernet boards a bit hard to find in Mac hardware these days <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>iamalittlepepper</strong> on 12 Jan 2015, 11:35)</p>

					<p>This is such a coincidence. My fellow had a similar problem just few hours ago. I am familiar with LuCI. So I found the source code for him. I didn&#039;t read it. I just give you a clue. </p><p>The platform check is done by a function in /bin/upgrade/platform.sh named platform_check_image. There are also some other functions. But this one I think will give so much info about your problem. I hope this will help.</p><p>Wandy</p>									</div>
