					<p>Hi guys, </p><p>I flashed the openwrt compiled by yoq on my Archer C2 (via tftp without any problem). Now I would like to install my LTE USB dongle Huawei 3276s but in the trunk repository many of the kmods have been already recompiled on newer kernel (not compatible with yoq´s). --force-depends did not help as dmesg shows errors when loading the module (also older versions of the modules compiled for kernel 3.18 did not work).</p><p>What options do I have now?</p><p>- wait for recompilation of the kernel - will that happen?<br />- install the version for Archer C20i&nbsp; (apparently not working good - Vezexe) or from Gli MT750 - did that try somebody?<br />- compile the kmods by my own - is it possible to install make, gcc on the limited space on ArcherC2 even with usb storage? <br />- ...?</p><p>Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>luckyluky</strong> on 20 Jun 2017, 08:33)</p>

					<p>Hi, guys. I also followed number #124 and #117 but couldn&#039;t get 5Ghz to work, so I decided to revert back to stock. I flashed the stock found in #124 download (same method as I flashed openwrt, tftpd), but it bricked my device. Neither wifi, nor the ethernet ports work. There are no light except the power LED. It doesn&#039;t blink. I think I might have screwed it up because the stock firmware from #124 might be from a US version, while my hardware is EU, maybe that has something to do with it. Is it possible to fix without using any special cables or dongles? Because I don&#039;t have them right now and buying it online would take atleast 2 weeks. (there are no electonic shops in my area that sell things like that). Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>meloncifer</strong> on 28 Jul 2017, 16:07)</p>

					<p>Got it to work but soon realised that the wifi range is abominable! If I go one room away from the router the speed plummets, I can get better speeds to the router downstairs. <br />Any idea on how to fix? This seems to affect both bands if I remember correctly but I was paying attention to the 5Ghz.

					<p>Ok so finally got the whole deal working and got 5ghz up and running, took me a while cause my original archer c2 was defective and wouldnt get flashed through tftp for the life of me. New unit flashed with no problems at lightning speed, then had to figure out WTH i was doing wrong and not understanding to get the 5ghz working since i&#039;m still kind of a noob at this. Finally got everything up and running and working great, only problem i have now though is that i ONLY get the 5ghz band when it boots up, both SSIDs run on channel 36 and thus the 2.4ghz band does not work and is not visible. Tried editing the config on the startup tab, tried just about everything i could think of but either i drop the startup commands and the 2.4ghz works fine but i got not 5ghz, or i turn on 5ghz and lose the 2.4ghz... Is there anyone who can help me out to figure WTF is going on and what i can do about it?</p>									</div>

					<p>well it was simply defective, the internet cut periodically and had plenty of problems with it since new, and unit was about 2 months old. Had alot of defective tp-links straight out of the box lately. This isn&#039;t my first case of failed new tp-links.</p>									</div>

					<p>Can someone help me unbrick the device? I&#039;m at a loss of what to do and haven&#039;t found anything helpful searching online. Bricked it by reverting back to stock by flashing the wrong .bin file (I think I flashed US version instead of EU). I can&#039;t flash through tfpd again because connecting with ethernet does not work. Only the power LED is on when I connect. I have bought a USB CH341A Programmer and a SOIC8 test clip, as another user managed to unbrick without soldering (#236) but I havent found any working solutions. Can anyone help me? Havent been even a year since I bought this router, would be a shame to throw it away.
