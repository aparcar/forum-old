That may have been one of those &quot;flukes&quot; that happen. Router now up for 20 hours after that reboot without issues. Used the 5Ghz last night for 5 hours of streaming. More then normal for me, more like 3 or 4 hours, but wanted to stress the 5Ghz some with streaming. Everything went fine, no pauses.

					<p>Thanks Bill1228</p><p>Since the 3200acm drivers became decent enough to use everyday, I have noticed a slow down, at night, between say 5-11pm. I seem to remember a similar slow down on the 1900ac and 1900acs, so I had always contributed the slowdown to noise in the neighborhood. And yes, as more people are home at night the noise level does go up, so it was pretty natural to think it. However, since using the 1900acs with the latest wifi driver, last night I didn&#039;t have much of a slowdown.. Speedtests were coming back right around 150/150 or even 200/200, which are speeds I just don&#039;t see in the evenings. So, it has me wondering if noise was ever the issue at all. Today, I have switched back to the 3200acm, and will test for the next few days, and see if the same holds true for it. Currently I&#039;m getting 300/300, using speedtests which is my current maximum, but that&#039;s pretty normal during the day.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davidc502</strong> on 13 Aug 2017, 21:13)</p>

I seem to remember a similar slow down on the 1900ac and 1900acs, so I had always contributed the slowdown to noise in the neighborhood. And yes, as more people are home at night the noise level does go up, so it was pretty natural to think it. However, since using the 1900acs with the latest wifi driver, last night I didn&#039;t have much of a slowdown.. Speedtests were coming back right around 150/150 or even 200/200, which are speeds I just don&#039;t see in the evenings. So, it has me wondering if noise was ever the issue at all. Today, I have switched back to the 3200acm, and will test for the next few days, and see if the same holds true for it.

The wrt3200 has been rock solid. Had 2 streaming sessions going at the same time last night and solid Internet browsing during the day. Current uptime is 2 days and 18 hours. <br />Again thanks for the great builds</p>									</div>

					<p>appreciate the feedback.....</p><p>May be a bit premature.... but have been testing consistently day and night, and the Android, Iphones, FireTV&#039;s, and laptops really like this new driver.&nbsp; Download/upload speeds have been very consistent, and fast even during peak periods. I no longer experience the download slowdown during the evenings.&nbsp; The two devices tested are the 1900acs and 3200acm.</p>									</div>
