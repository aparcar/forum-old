					<p>I believe I am doing something wrong. I am unable to enable the 5Ghz radio. It is listed as &quot;Mode: Unknown&quot; and says, &quot;Wireless is disabled or not associated&quot;<br />Edit: All sorted. Something I have played around with has made it work. I currently have it set to HT20 and transmit power to 0dBm and it is working. Going to play around with it later to see what is breaking it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>simplexion</strong> on 19 Mar 2014, 05:28)</p>

					<p>Is HT40+/- not supported on the 5Ghz radio? It appears to kill that radio if you enable it.<br />Would using the firmware generated from <a href="https://www.crc.id.au/2014/01/10/wd-mynet-n600-n750-openwrt-update/">HERE</a> resolve the issues I am having, or is this even necessary with the current trunk?

					<p>Hello!<br />Been using my WD N750 with Barrier Breaker for months and it was great!<br />Now i messed up with it: tryed to flash some images(even tried Gargoyle from eko.one.pl) and configurations but what i was looking for was a way to have it all including transmission, usb-hdd, usb wan, mwan3 working on web interface.<br />At some point wan port didn&#039;t work so flashed back original firmware and its all working (as original fw) except that i can&#039;t reflash any fw again(no ping on recovery mode) not original neither 3rd party fw!<br />I was thinking about to reflash using serial but never made it and my search results are too wide to be sure what to do.<br />So i&#039;m posting here to get some ideas and as a last resource how to perform serial recovery the correct way: wich cable, wich apps, windows or linux,... etc. Can do some soldering to make serial permanent on this device.</p><p>Thanx in advance!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nicaroxo</strong> on 17 Sep 2014, 17:18)</p>

					<p>Gess what? Lefted it alone for 24h unplugged... Retried with usual from the recovery panel and... Tadaaaa!... The webpage changed to countdown(170s)... Now it reflashed and i&#039;m reconfiguring!<br />So, after all i think i was confusing:<br />- It seems that there&#039;s no ping in recovery, unless my unit is defective. So if there&#039;s no ping, what happened yesterday when i rechecked setup for hours and couldn&#039;t flash? Allways took some time(30s) to process ending at &quot;server not found&quot; page (like a timeout)...</p><p>If someone knows how, i&#039;d be very thankfull to enable a serial console and the guidance for that (if its a solution).</p><p>Member metai and others who helped, thank you!</p>									</div>

I mixed it up with the DIR-505 recovery mode, which is practically identical but works on 0.1 ... and for good measure changed it around, too. Not my finest hour ...
