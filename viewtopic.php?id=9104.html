					<p>Just wanted to post my experiences getting a v1 WRT55AG flashed with OpenWRT for the first time.&nbsp; </p><p>I&#039;m new to OpenWRT and read conflicting reports of OpenWRT working and not working on the WRT55AG.&nbsp; It was an extra router for me so I decided to just give it a try.&nbsp; I downloaded the openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx firmware and used the built-in Linksys web admin interface to upgrade to OpenWRT.&nbsp; It worked the first time.&nbsp; </p><p>After that I installed X-wrt and have been off and running ever since.&nbsp; No problems.&nbsp; I&#039;d be happy to answer questions about it for anyone with a WRT55AG.&nbsp; But of course if you try it and your router bricks, I assume no responsibility.</p><p>Ryan</p>									</div>
