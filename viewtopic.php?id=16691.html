					<p>Hey,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to get a serial console on my NAS, but I&#039;m entirely sure which pins are serial, and what the pin layout would be.&nbsp; Is there a safe way to go testing with a multimeter, or any general tips/advice?</p><p>A picture of the board can be found here:<br /><a href="http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/content/view/30056/75/1/5/">http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/content/ â€¦ 56/75/1/5/</a><br />As seen, there are two 2x5 pin blocks in the upper right of the picture.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>More than likely, ether CN1 or CN3 is for JTAG, with the same pinout as the D-Link DNS-323. It may be possible that the other one is for serial, but don&#039;t rule out CN4 or JP1 as being serial.</p>									</div>
