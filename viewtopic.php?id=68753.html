					<p>New to openwrt, running a seeeduino cloud. I do not have enough space to put my source code into the root directory, but I noticed I have 10+ mb in &#039;/tmp&#039;. My thought is to either change the partition size for this folder, or place the source code here into &#039;/tmp&#039;.</p><p>I tried placing my source code into this file. However, any files I place in the folder are deleted when I reset the device.</p><p>Is there a configuration or startup file of some kind that causes the any new files in &#039;/tmp&#039; to be deleted or is it at the kernel level?</p><p>It is very possible I am approaching this entirely wrong, so any guidance would be appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>You&#039;re &quot;approaching this entirely wrong&quot;, /tmp/ is tmpfs backed (== a RAM filesystem), which means it loses its contents by definition whenever the device gets (re-)started.</p>									</div>

					<p>Adding some more storage space by connecting a cheap USB thumb drive could be an option for you. Having data such as &quot;source code&quot; doesn&#039;t sound like being required to be mounted as a startup script, so that should be an easy task with a huge impact.</p>									</div>
