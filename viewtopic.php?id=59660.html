					<p>Hello Marc,</p><p>I don&#039;t see any response to your post above. However, I would like to know how much information have you gathered to port OpenWRT on a Qualcomm snapdragon devices. Currently, BestBuy has this <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/verizon-wireless-prepaid-motorola-moto-e-4g-with-8gb-memory-no-contract-cell-phone-with-blue-grip-case-black/4407800.p?id=1219744031852&amp;skuId=4407800">Verizon Wireless Prepaid - Motorola Moto E 4G with 8GB Memory No-Contract Cell Phone with Blue Grip Case - Black</a> under US $10. It is based on a 1.2GHz 64-bit quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 CPU (Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 8916) with 1/8 GB RAM/storage. I placed an order and hope will be able to hack it to run OpenWRT.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mazilo</strong> on 27 Nov 2015, 18:32)</p>
