					<p>Hi I have a wD n750 flashed with Gargoyle&nbsp; 1.8 it&#039;s baste on Openwrt 14.07. It works really good. I use 5 GHZ and 2.4 I have about 30 devices all of them get fair bandwidth using QOS and I keep my kids safe bby using opendns and the built in plugin for ad blocking.</p><p>You can flash as much as you like you will not brake your router and the grate thing about the n750 is the built in flash tool that lets you flash a new file if the first time fucks up. see here:</p><p>How to recover a My Net Router from a failed firmware update<br /><a href="https://wdc.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/9618/">https://wdc.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/9618/</a></p><p>I don&#039;t no of a way to brick one of these routers.</p><p>If you find you don&#039;t like Gargoyle it is really simple to flash back to the stock firmware.<br />Good luck if you need help I am a mod on the Gargoyle forum.</p>									</div>
