					<p>I am new to configuring OpenWRT devices, and have a Qualcomm Atheros AP151 reference board with QSDK Wireless Router QCA9558.LN / LuCI 0.11.1 Release (0.11.1)</p><p>I have a NVR(Network Video Recorder) with an onboard LAN(DHCP - 192.168.*.*), connected to the QCA9558 board (Static - 11.1.1.1).&nbsp; </p><p>By design the NVR LAN is on a separate network.&nbsp; The Wifi of the QCA9558 board is designed to connect to cameras only, and does not supply internet to devices on that network.</p><br /><p>My goal and reason for reaching out to you, is so I can configure the NVR LAN / QCA9558 as an Access Point(Range Extender)&nbsp; I want the lan port on the NVR and QCA9558 to be on the same Network / subnet / gateway and not on a Vlan.</p><p>Could you please help by providing insight for me to accomplish this?</p>									</div>
