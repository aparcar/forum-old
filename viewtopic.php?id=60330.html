					<p>Title says it all.</p><p>I checked this page...<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/rosewill/rnx-n150rt">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/rosewill/rnx-n150rt</a></p><p>But, it shows the V-1 and the V-2 board is quite different.</p><p>I can&#039;t find the Tx/Rx/Gnd pads. There is an obvious set of with four-pads in the lower right corner of the board. The rightmost has a square around, but unlike other models of N150RT the left most is Vcc (and not the square on) and the next one is Gnd. That leaves the third + square-one to be Tx/Rx or Rx/Tx, I guessed.</p><p>But, hooking up a USB serial programmer and using puTTY I can&#039;t get it to display anything at any baud rates. I am guessing that they are not the Tx/Rx pads.</p><p>I found another site (can&#039;t find it again) and they showed a pic of the Tx/Rx pads &quot;hidden&quot; in the middle of the circuit board for the V-1, but so far I can&#039;t find anything that shows anything in puTTY </p><p>Anyone have a clue where Tx/Rx are? Or how to find where I in hook in the Serial?</p><p>I did find a Russian/Polish site that un-soldered the chip, reprogrammed it in a MicroPro and soldered it back in. A bit much for me and an $18 router. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Bumping this thread because its very related to my issue also:</p><p>A while back, I bought 2x of these routers off newegg when they were on sale for $10 as cheap spares/testing</p><p>I bricked one w/ dd-wrt (wrong firmware I think?)<br />Second one was successful with the dd-wrt firmware on rosewill&#039;s site</p><p>I tried the same testpads and only got garbage output (I also dont have a usb to ttl adapter mainly because I have many raspi&#039;s (3.3v uart) and arduinos (5v uart) lying around that do the same job) I wrote off the router as bricked junk and thew it in my parts bin.</p><p>Out of curiosity (after seeing kanghoonp&#039;s post) I wired up my working router&#039;s to my raspi, same garbage output as my bricked unit displayed but it stops right when the kernel boots and the output becomes readable and not garbage.</p><p>So the bottom line is the bootloader output via serial is garbage, but when the kernel boots its readable, so I know the wiring and my setup is a-ok.</p><p>Example snippet:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>,���U���V���b��C�
