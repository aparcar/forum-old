					<p>I guess you mean you associated the name with the external IP address at the router, and expected the router to redirect it back to the internal server; however, you are getting the router&#039;s LuCI pages.</p><p>It does not work because the router sees those requests as traffic coming from the LAN interface, even if you are using the external IP address; have a look to the firewall configuration, and see how you always specify the interface where the traffic comes from, not the IP address where it is going to.</p>									</div>

					<p>enable loopback and that should be able to do the job, of course this will have some caveats in regards of performance since the router is actually doing NAT on that traffic, you can use dnsmasq and add a custom dns entry there to resolve it with internal IP instead of external.</p>									</div>

					<p>So here&#039;s how my network is setup</p><p>ISP Modem (A)<br />OpenWRT Router (B)</p><p>I&#039;ve tried setting hostname to point to 2 different IP&#039;s: 192.168.1.2 which is assigned by A, and 192.168.2.1 which is the internal IP of B.</p><p>When I point it at A, I am pointed to port 443 which hosts one of my services regardless of what port I specify (i.e. <a href="http://abcd.com:8000">http://abcd.com:8000</a> will go to the service in port 443). Disabling loopback on the port forward for port 443 also prevents this scenario from happening.</p><p>When I point it at B, I reach the router login page. If i specify a port, it just says unknown.</p><p>Here&#039;s the weird thing: My modem recognizes that abcd.com is the ddns that is assigned to me and if no hostname is setup in B, it loops it back to the modem config page. I can then create a port forward rule to pass it to B.</p><p>I was hoping I wouldnt need to rely on the modem (I&#039;ve set B as a DMZ on A since I dont want to set port forward on both) but if you guys think that it&#039;s the better solution, I will trust your expert advice.</p>									</div>

					<p>Could you please explain in detail and maybe with some pictures what you&#039;re trying to do?</p><p>Domain names don&#039;t have anything to do with ports. Well, there are special ones.
