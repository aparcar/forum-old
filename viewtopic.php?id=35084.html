					<p>Hi !</p><p>I have a brand new WRT54GL on which I&#039;ve installed latest openwrt (backfire 10.03.1 r29592).<br />I&#039;ve bought this router to make a private WLAN on which there is no gateway and no DNS. As computer connected to this WLAN are also connected to another network with gateway &amp; dns, I don&#039;t want to touch their config.</p><p>That&#039;s why I want the DHCP on the WLAN to NOT send DNS &amp; default gateway DHCP options. But I can&#039;t find how to do that !</p><p>I&#039;ve been able to disable the DNS server of dnsmasq, but it&#039;s still sending the DNS option (that is not correct now, as there is no DNS server running on the wrt54gl now).</p><p>Is there a way to configure this ?</p><p>In the default &#039;dhcp&#039; config, there is a &quot;option &#039;router&#039;&quot; that I&#039;ve removed hoping this would at least stop the sending of option 3, but it&#039;s not. I could not find its role in the doc (http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/dhcp ).</p><p>Thanks for any hint/help !</p><p>Marc</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, found it, after several hour of digging... And few minutes after asking for help !</p><p>Simply add the following lines in dnsmasq.conf:</p><p>option-dhcp=3<br />option-dhcp=6</p><p>This will disable the sending of option 3 (default router) and 6 (dns server)</p>									</div>
