					<p>Hi All, my first post. </p><p>I&#039;ve been trying to track down how to submit a package to be hosted on the openwrt respository.&nbsp; The link <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/packages">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/packages</a>&nbsp; is very helpful in describing how to create/make a package but doesn&#039;t explain what happens next.&nbsp; </p><p>After all, the point of making a package is so it can be shared with others right?&nbsp; Or is the main benefit of creating a custom package to assist advanced openwrt users who rebuild their own customised scripted images on a frequent basis? </p><br /><br /><p>Cheers,<br />Des</p><p>Ps.&nbsp; A big thanks to everyone who has contributed to openwrt so far!</p>									</div>
