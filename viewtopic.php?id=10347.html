					<p>I&#039;m thinking about using OpenVPN to set this up:</p><p>I have two networks, each with different a public IP address and behind a NAT box.&nbsp; I want them to have access to each other.&nbsp; My idea for the cleanest approach was to make each NAT box a router and put the networks in different subnets.&nbsp; Since they have a default route to the NAT box already, the NAT box would look at the destination address and either perform NAT (if it&#039;s an internet destination) or forward it to through the VPN tunnel--so it&#039;s a router.</p><p>I plan on using openvpn.</p><p>Should this be relatively easy to do?&nbsp; Making two networks that are in different subnets very easy, but I never set up routed (or something like it) on a NAT box and have it work in conjunction with both NAT and a VPN tunnel (although, I suppose the VPN tunnel would look just like an interface with the IP address of the other subnet).</p><p>I&#039;m thinking of something like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>          ( Internet )
