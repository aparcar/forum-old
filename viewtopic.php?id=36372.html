					<p>Hi there,</p><p>I&#039;m really sorry if this question sounds a bit noob, but after I flashed the new OpenWRT Firmware (1.5) on my TP-Link WR 703N, I did not get an admin interface on 192.168.1.1. Telnet and SSH both are working great, even without failsafe mode. But it works only if i connect to the device via cable, WiFi is not found either. <br />Since I&#039;m pretty new to this, is there a possibility to re-flash the device with some other firmware via Telnet/SSH? (or anything else? anything is welcome) If yes, please tell me what I need to do.</p><p>I already read this <br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.flashing#via.bootloader.and.ethernet.port">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/gener … ernet.port</a> <br />But I can&#039;t get onto the FTP. seems like the device has almost instant boot....</p><p>I am really grateful for any solution.</p><br /><p>Thanks guys!</p>									</div>
