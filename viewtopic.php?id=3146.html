					<p>Hey, I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s been done before, but when I last looked I couldn&#039;t find much. Anyway, I&#039;ve taken Peter Stamfest&#039;s iptables-snmp net-snmp library, fixed it up (it had a few memory leaks and couldn&#039;t handle multiple oids in a single packet) and put it in a package.</p><p><a href="http://www.nobiscuit.com/iptables-snmp/">http://www.nobiscuit.com/iptables-snmp/</a></p><p>The snmpd/libnetsnmp packages that come with whiterussian aren&#039;t compiled with the options that allow loadable libraries to work, so I&#039;ve included those packages as well. The source is there if you want to have a look. The code is pretty ugly, but it works for me: <a href="http://www.nobiscuit.com/mrtg/">http://www.nobiscuit.com/mrtg/</a></p><p>All the graphs except for the top two are generated from polling iptables rules on my wrt54gs.</p>									</div>
