					<p>All,<br />I was wondering if anyone has an idea how to create a wifi repeater (non wds) using openwrt and Ralink based hardware.</p><p>Before you point me at the generic wiki on how to create a repeater bridge please note that I am asking about how this can be accomplished on Ralink.&nbsp; The current rt2x00 driver does not support multiple virtual interfaces, in other words I cannot create an instance of &#039;ap&#039; and &#039;sta&#039; at the same time.</p><p>So if the &#039;normal&#039; method of creating a &quot;Universal Repeater&quot; in openwrt will not work are there any alternatives?&nbsp; Would something like batman-adv or awds work for this?</p><p>Any suggestions are welcome.</p><p>Rip</p>									</div>
