					<p>I recently got a Linksys EA4500 and checked to see if it was supported by OpenWRT and I saw it was so I installed the version linked on the Wiki page for the device. However I see it is Designated Driver and thats the bleeding edge version and I would like to go to Chaos Calmer. I dont see a Chaos Calmer version in the ftp so I did remember seeing something called the Candyhouse Chaos Calmer so I downloaded that image file and I am trying to flash that but it keeps rebooting to Designated Driver. I have reflashed with stock Linksys firmware and that worked fine but then I tried to flash the Candyhouse one from stock and it was still DD.</p><p>Partly the reasons Id like to do this is a few bugs Ive noticed in DD. On the software package list the Install/Remove links dont work. When you click them it refreshes the page and the packages dont get installed. To install packages you need to to that in a SSH window (PuTTY). The other issue is that even if you install a new theme like the OpenWRT theme it seems to break the whole UI and it reverts to basic HTML with no styling whatsoever. The only theme that works is the default Bootstrap theme.<br />I do understand theres the primary and alternate boot partitions and so I have tried to flash the Candyhouse firmware twice in a row thinking I could get it to flash onto the other partition slot. Didnt work.</p><p>Any help would be appreciated. Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>John877</strong> on 3 May 2016, 03:47)</p>

					<p>hmm... i&#039;m not observing the behavior you have observed on install/remove.&nbsp; have you tried clearing your web browser&#039;s cache?&nbsp; or try a different web browser?&nbsp; i&#039;m using the default bootstrap theme and quite satisfied with it hence no reason for me to try other themes at this time.&nbsp; i&#039;m currently on the trunk r49223 build.</p><p>perhaps one important caveat to consider before flashing your ea4500 with a candyhouse cc image is candyhouse cc images do not support sysupgrade either via LuCI or CLI.</p><p>one last comment.&nbsp; if you seriously believe there are bugs in the current dd trunk builds then please a ticket so the issue can be investigated.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ive tried the Install/Remove package issue in different browsers from normal now.&nbsp; May main browser is standard Firefox and I have now tried it in a different variant of Firefox called Cyberfox from a different directory. Ive also tried it in Google Chrome.<br />On my old router I had BB and CC installed and on the Package listing I was always able to middle click the Install link as i scrolled down the package list and itd install them as I went. I tried just left clicking this time too and noticed the popup asking if I wanted to so I said yes and the package I tried to install was the adblock one and it said that there was an error caused by a dependency so its not the same error.&nbsp; Ive noticed now though the Update Lists button is gone.</p><p>Do you know if theres a way to clear both boot partitions then TFTP a firmware onto the router?</p>									</div>

					<p>Tried that firstboot command. didnt do anything.</p><p>Restored stock Linksys firmware and tried to flash the Candyhouse one again, it boots back up to Designated Driver again. Tried to do the DD sysupgrade you linked and it broke everything completely. Wouldnt start up to anything, just gave an error that it couldnt be found or refused, one of the two, i forget.&nbsp; I just want to nuke the partition that has Designated Driver so I can have Stock and then nothing on backup if I can. Then I can install the Chaos Calmer from scratch.&nbsp; I cant seem to get rid of or flash over this Designated Driver now. </p><p>Ive also tried to TFTP using a CLI TFTP program that works in DOS window and I tried using the GUI program on Linksys&#039;s site.
