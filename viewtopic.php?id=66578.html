					<p>OpenWrt is technically capable of doing what you want, however your choice of device is not very good.&nbsp; It has only 4mb flash which will be a struggle to load the packages you need to make this work.&nbsp; I really would suggest that you look at other devices with 16mb flash and 64mb memory.&nbsp; A faster processor will also help your VPN processing.</p><p>The table of hardware can help you find a more usable device.<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/views/toh_extended_all?dataflt%5BDevice+Type*%7E%5D=travel">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/views/toh_ … %5D=travel</a><br />(copy the entire link)<br />Gli devices come with OpenWrt preinstalled.</p>									</div>
