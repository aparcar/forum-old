					<p>So you are saying you want to make a wifi link between the two?&nbsp; That is a fairly long distance for two indoor type boxes especially if there are trees or anything else in the way.</p><p>Assuming you are running OpenWrt on it, you can log into the cabin modem and run a wifi scan to see if it detects the signal from the main modem.&nbsp; Go to the networks wireless page and click the scan button.&nbsp; If it does, you can create either a routed client or a WDS client (if the main modem has OpenWrt to be WDS capable).</p>									</div>

					<p>If you mean to see which neighbors, etc are received by the radio in the main modem, the firmware in that device would have to offer a scan function.</p>									</div>
