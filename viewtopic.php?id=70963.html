					<p>Very helpful...</p><p>As someone who is new to this, could you provide clarification?&nbsp; </p><p>So, I read on the wiki a bunch of steps with code.&nbsp; I am able to flash the firmware and see where all the code can be entered.</p><p>For me to get the router to recognize my hotspot (SSID: &quot;iPhone&quot;) I enter that it in the code, correct? </p><p>Then, I have a password for my hotspot (is that WPA?).&nbsp; I then would hard code that passcode into the code as well? </p><p>Are there any other settings in the code that I need to change for this specific configuration?</p><p>I just want to be able to have other devices see my NG R8000 and then have that connection push them through to my hotspot.&nbsp; (Though, I would like to require those devices to enter a passcode so that not every device can easily connect.)</p><p>Thanks SO MUCH for your help.</p>									</div>
