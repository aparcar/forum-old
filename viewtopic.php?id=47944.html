					<p>Hello there!</p><p>Specs, first:<br />TP-Link WDR4300, running OpenWRT v12.09<br />ISP: Kabel Deutschland (Cable Germany)<br />Max. Download: 32 Mbps<br />Max Upload: 2 Mbps</p><p>I need some help/advice to get my connection under control. Whenever someone does some heavy downloading (filehoster) the rest of the network gets stuck. When this is happening it is not possible to access anything through the WAN-port as it seems to be completely jammed. I only tried it over 5 GHz WLAN on 802.11n (450Mbps Up/down) so far as the only client on that interface.</p><p>Here is a screen of the eth0 traffic when nothing is working for me:<br /><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-MQXiNPMq7PE/UrQiFLf2gUI/AAAAAAAAAYU/Ep-C8hvVWkM/w1064-h734-no/Massive+Traffic.png">https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-MQXi … raffic.png</a></p><p>I tried some configs with the basic qos-scripts package but this is not able to reduce the downloading host.<br />Also tried this script: <a href="http://pastebin.com/YL55na2E">http://pastebin.com/YL55na2E</a></p><p>Guess there is something more effective needed.</p><br /><p>Additionally:<br />I play an online game based on P2P connection and do skype calls everyday. These massive downloads always kill any connections i have opened, so I would be happy if you consider it in your answer... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Kind regards</p><p>BenCeption</p>									</div>
