					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m a relative noob to this stuff. I have a R6250 that I previously had DD-WRT installed from Astrill for VPN. Unfortunately their VPN sucks now and DD-WRT only had OpenVPN installed which is unusable in China.</p><p>So I installed OpenWRT fine from the link below over the DD-WRT (was this wrong?). Now when I go into LuCI to change settings for network configuration (also LuCI looks a lot different in my version than the ones in screenshots and youtube), I go to Lan -&gt; Edit -&gt; Change from Static IP to DHCP. I confirm that I want to change the network protocol. </p><p>Then I save and apply changes, the message &quot;waiting to apply changes&quot; comes up with the loading symbol. This is where it gets stuck. I can&#039;t move to any pages (even after several minutes) and I cannot get back into luci without doing a 30 second reset on the router.</p><p>Any suggestions would be great. I&#039;m using shadowsocks currently on my main computer for VPN (which has been GREAT in China) and I was suggested to install OpenWRT as it could support the type of server i&#039;ve set up (I hope? I&#039;m using Linux for the server).</p><p>Thank you guys!</p><p><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/hwdata/netgear/netgear_r6250">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/hwdata/net â€¦ gear_r6250</a></p>									</div>

Did you want your R6250 to be part of other network with different device running DHCP server? I guess not. I&#039;m afraid you don&#039;t have much idea about network configuration. I can only suggest learning more about network stuff.</p>									</div>

I&#039;m not trying to do anything special at the moment, just turn DHCP on so it can take the PPPOE connection from my main router using a regular LAN port from the main router. This is what I did before on DD-WRT, turn the DHCP on and then it would accept the main router&#039;s LAN connection.</p><p>So do you know what I can do from here? I&#039;ve been reading guides but like I said the system doesn&#039;t match what I have for LuCI and the code for command line doesn&#039;t match.</p>									</div>

My main router is NOT the one that I have OpenWRT with. It is directly connected with the modem in PPPoE.

But you just told OpenWrt to stop using 192.168.1.1 and use whatever address it gets from the DHCP server.<br />See how it works?</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes i see what you mean, let me go through step by step and see if you can figure out where I went wrong.</p><p>For DHCP.<br />1. Configure main router (MR) to connect to modem with PPPoE and act as bridge (tested to work on OpenWrt Router (OWR) before I flashed with DDWRT, worked fine)<br />2. Connect Ethernet from MR to Internet on OWR)<br />3 connect Ethernet from OWR to computer<br />4. Login to OpenWRT.<br />5 root/admin<br />6. Go to network -&gt; interfaces -&gt; interface overview -&gt; Network LAN and click Edit<br />7. Under Interfaces LAN select Protocol under General Setup (I noticed DHCP server is on the bottom)<br />8 change from Static Address to DHCP Client<br />9. Save and apply changes<br />* get message saying waiting to apply changes. Cannot login into router with resetting it. Will not connect to Internet.</p><p>For PPPoE repeat above 1-7 then<br />8. Change from Static to PPPoE <br />9. Enter in UN and PW from PPPoE (same as I did on the MR)<br />10 click save and apply changes<br />* same as above, cannot connect after waiting several minutes.</p><p>I can post screenshots if that would be helpful</p>									</div>
