					<p>I&#039;ve flashed the router with Backfire 10.03.1-rc5, and installed kmod-ath9k, as suggested on the router&#039;s wiki page.&nbsp; Even after a reboot, wifi detect gives me no output.&nbsp; Can someone help me figure out what I&#039;ve done wrong?</p><p>The ethernet seems to work fine, I just can&#039;t get the wifi working.</p><p>It&#039;s the DG834GT as provided by Sky in the UK.&nbsp; To flash it, I followed the instructions on the wiki page, except I used a sky-specific firmware image that&nbsp; found through Google (the file name is &quot;DG834GT-1SKUKS.V1.03.87.CU3.04.img&quot;) instead of the one suggested, and using the broadcom firmware tool, set the target firmware to &quot;DG834GT-1SKUKS&quot;, the same as in the downloaded img file.&nbsp; Using the stock firmware .img caused invalid file errors (unfortunately, I&#039;ve forgotten the specific error I got). </p><p>After flashing, I&#039;ve connected via ethernet, disabled DHCP, given it a static IP address while I configure everything else, and connected it, again via ethernet, to my current router (a virgin superhub).&nbsp; I can use that to connect to the netgear&#039;s openWrt ssh and web interface, and the netgear can connect to the internet, so I&#039;m confident nothing&#039;s wrong with the firmware.&nbsp; The &quot;opkg install kmod-ath9k&quot; completed successfully - or at least it gave no errors.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried manually entering the /etc/config/wireless values found in a different thread on this forum, but running the &quot;wifi&quot; command with those values brought up &quot;interface not supported&quot;.&nbsp; I&#039;m lost on what else to try.</p><p>This is my first foray into openWrt, so any help is greatly appreciated.&nbsp; I hope I&#039;ve not missed something glaringly obvious.</p>									</div>
