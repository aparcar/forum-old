					<p>Is it possible to use the serial port on a WRT54G running OpenWrt as though it was a serial port on my Windows XP machine?&nbsp; i.e. Can I address the serial port on my Wrt as Com3 on my WinXp box?&nbsp; How about telnet into a specific port on the WRT and have it rerouted to the serial port?</p><p>Here is what I am trying to do...<br />I have a LCD/Keypad device from <a href="http://www.crystalfontz.com">www.crystalfontz.com</a> (CFA-635-Serial to be exact).&nbsp; I would like to plug it into a WRT router somewhere in my house and have the software to control it running on my Windows server in the basement.&nbsp; I have written the software I am using so I can control and make changes on that end.&nbsp; I just need some way to pass data in/out of the serial port on the WRT from my windows box.</p><p>Any ideas?</p><p>-Brad</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metoo2057</strong> on 3 Apr 2006, 23:58)</p>

					<p>you need a linux daemon that forwards tcp connections on a specific port directly to the serial port.<br />It could be quite easy with inetd or xinetd. don&#039;t remember...</p><p>on windows you simply open a socket open a tcp connection, and write into it as if it was a com port</p>									</div>

He had a whole crazy setup with an EEG which would read brain waves of tense muscles or relaxed muscles; which, in MindPong (!) would be &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot;, for sentence writing &quot;1&quot; or &quot;0&quot; in a 31-charachter alphabet, or on the mind control platform, &quot;forward&quot; or &quot;right&quot; (no reverse... ).</p><p>The big problem we came across was having this run as a startup script. Only way we found in the frantic hours before he had to leave was to edit /etc/init.d/rcS and remove the output pipe to logger.</p><p>Enjoy,</p><p> - Yasha</p>									</div>
