					<p>Hello everyone! This is my first post so please forgive me if this is dragged out question. I bought a Linksys 1900 ACS recently and I have always liked using upgraded firmware. My last dabble into this was waaaaay back with a wrt54g router.</p><p>Going into the wiki here I find the firmware 15.05 BUT I am not 100% sure if this can be used in my router which has the 1.6 processor. I am stuck on the two versions listed V.1 and V.2 which to my understanding are ONLY 1900AC models and NOT 1900ACS model. </p><p>Do I use something from this list? <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/mvebu/generic/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots … u/generic/</a></p><p>Is the Chaos Calmer all I need? <a href="https://openwrt.org/">https://openwrt.org/</a></p><p>which one do I use? <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05/</a></p><p>I also assume that once I get the right one running I will have to install LUCI so I can access router through browser correct?</p><p>From the bit I have read although 15.05 is stable it appears that this community will only be improving on what is currently available.&nbsp; Should I just wait for the next update?</p><p>Keep up the great work and thanks for any and all help in advance!</p>									</div>

					<p>I have been sitting on this thinking the same thing.&nbsp; My 1900 ACS has recently stated to degrade my 300/20 connection,which is odd in itself as everything was fine until a day ago. I want things to work better as&nbsp; did spend quite a bit on this router. </p><p>I think its cool OpenWrt is actively making strides to making it work better and on linksys end so far just one firmware upgrade has been released. Hopefully someone gets it right in due time as in my opinion is its a &quot;new&quot; router and its going to take time to iron out.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>crunkjuice1</strong> on 11 Dec 2015, 05:16)</p>
