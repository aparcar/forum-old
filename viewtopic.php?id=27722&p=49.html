					<p>Try a different client? Also, what are you expecting to see? I&#039;m no radio expert, but from reading about transmit power, apparently you can get worse signal by increasing it. Other factors in your environment can affect things as well. I&#039;m just not sure you can execute a command and see a big jump in your graph there. Also with just one client you don&#039;t have enough data to draw a conclusion.</p>									</div>
