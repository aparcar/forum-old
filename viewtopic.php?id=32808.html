					<p>Hi,</p><p>I upgraded from 10.03.1-rc4 yesterday to 10.03.1-rc6 on a WNDR3700 box (v1). Initially I thought it was fine but today I noticed that some of my LAN computer were unable to both ARP and PING (with static arp entry) _some_ of the other LAN boxes. Very strange. Downgraded to rc5 and the same problem were there. Gave up and is now running rc4 without this problem.</p><p>My network: GATEWAY (wndr3700), PS3, NAS, PC (win7), MACBOOK</p><p>The problem: PC could not arp/ping PS3 or NAS. I could see the packets (ARP reqs) on GATEWAY (tcpdump), but the packets were not delivered (switched) to the destination (PS3/NAS). So the NAS/PS3 never got the ARP etc..</p><p>What worked: PC could access GATEWAY and internet, and MACBOOK could access/ping PS3 and NAS without problems. GATEWAY could also access PS3/NAS.</p><p>Very strange. Has anyone seen anything like this?</p><p>Cheers</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ole.h</strong> on 5 Nov 2011, 21:46)</p>
