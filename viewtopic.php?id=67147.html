					<p>Hey everyone,</p><p>I&#039;m a little stuck.&nbsp; I was able to install OpenWRT on an x86_64 device and get it working.&nbsp; The issue is that I&#039;d like to support muliple SSID&#039;s on a single radio with VLANs, which (as I&#039;ve found) is not supported by the b43 driver.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it doesn&#039;t seem like the broadcom-wl package, which does support multiple SSID&#039;s (and 802.11n) is available for x86.</p><p>Does anyone know if it&#039;s possible to even compile the broadcom-wl source for x86?&nbsp; I&#039;m not positive, but I seem to remember reading that it was released for MIPS.</p><p>A side note, I&#039;m aware there is the broadcom-sta driver for x86, but I don&#039;t think it supports AP mode so that could be a no-go.&nbsp; Please correct me if I&#039;m wrong.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>									</div>
