There is no &quot;best hardware&quot;, so stop asking. Purchase something that meets your requirements.&quot;<br />- Why are the routers on this page recommended? What are the criteria to list a device as &quot;Recommended&quot;?<br />- Will those recommendations still be valid in 1...2 years?

					<p>@tmo26, again kudos on your work. Since this question comes up every now and then in the forums, it&#039;s a great idea to have it addressed by experts.</p><p>I don&#039;t think you should ponder wherever or not devices on that page will be still recommended in 1-2 years. &quot;I pay professionals to predict the future and even they sometimes get it wrong.&quot; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> As long as the device is available in a significant region or can be purchased online globally it should be listed based on its current merits and current release/trunk support. </p><p>I can suggest some categories instead of the current separation by chipset/CPU:<br />1. Portable/Travel Router<br />2. Wireless Router<br />3. Wired Router</p><p>I believe in each category you can easily set the minimal criteria:<br />1. Flash/RAM (set the requirement per price tier).<br />2. WiFi support (802.11ac vs 802.11n, WiFi bandwidth).<br />3. CPU (yeah, that&#039;s tricky I know, but that&#039;s why the gurus can make the call).<br />4. Global/regional availability.<br />5. Ease of unlock/flashing OpenWrt.<br />6. Additional points for additional features (like the modes slider on travel routers, USB3 vs USB2, etc).</p><p>If there&#039;re 4-5 routers in each category falling into different price tiers, that&#039;d be great. Also the criteria above should be different for different price tiers (ie the more expensive routers should only be listed if they are equipped with significantly better radios and/or larger flash/RAM, etc).</p><p>My concern would be unwanted/malicious edits of the page, so I suggest you pick a few volunteers and lock the edits to yourself and them. And you can get expert/user opinions here in the forums. Maybe a special/pinned thread in general discussion will do?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stangri</strong> on 10 Apr 2016, 13:32)</p>

					<p>The logic on those pages should offer advice on criterias that are important in router selection. And various user groups (plain dumb end-user, tweaking enthusiast, kernel driver developer) have different needs. So there is no single best advice.</p><p>One addition to the nice list from stangri:</p><p><strong>The ability to recover from failed flash / problematic firmware via a built-in recovery procedure. </strong><br />&nbsp; It is a major plus if the router has either <br />&nbsp; - dual firmware: fallback to the &quot;second firmware&quot; if the first one fails to boot x times consecutively.<br />&nbsp; - recovery/failsafe logic in bootloader (u-boot, ...) offering an easy tftp upload. </p><p>For this criteria there are &quot;really easy ones&quot; with TFTP server triggered automatically or via button (e.g. WNDR3700), and more restricted ones with TFTP client (where you have to provide a TFTP server at a specific IP address for recovery). Easiest is a built-in web interface or TFTP server without a complex trigger, least useful is TFTP client requiring triggering via characters from keyboard via serial and a TFTP server at a defined address.</p><p>It might not seem that important at the first glance, but in the long run that is a useful feature especially if the user is going to tweak/develop Openwrt. I have de-bricked my WNDR3700/3800 several dozen times during the past 6 years, so the relatively easy recovery mode has been really beneficial.</p>									</div>

At least, that&#039;s how I think about it. I am not a hardliner when it comes to GNU, FOSS etc., but for stuff like this, if I have the choice, especially when you look at long term support (for me as a consumer that means 4-5 years), I get hardware that depends least on manufacturer goodwill for software updates.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>I&#039;d be more concerned with manufacturers (TP-Link) locking their routers from easy flash to 3rd party firmwares.</p></blockquote></div><p>A very valid concern as well, but as long as there&#039;s some way to get have those devices flashed, I would still recommend them (obviously not for beginners).

Sure, they decided on the easiest way to comply, but that doesn&#039;t make them the only guilty party.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Borromini</strong> on 10 Apr 2016, 13:58)</p>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>First of all, sorry if such a page existed I didn&#039;t find one and I had no intentions to step on anyone&#039;s toes. So, given that we live in 2016 and most ppl who asks about this aren&#039;t hardcore Linux users and whatnot I figured that a list with hardware that isn&#039;t hard to restore, works decently (ie stable), doesn&#039;t need serial for install/recovery of firmware and they might want to use something more such as openvpn, USB etc. Even I personally would appreciate such a list. I honestly think that you have to turn down the zealotry a few notches and see the overall picture if you want to keep/&quot;help&quot; the (&quot;novice&quot;) user base. </p><p>Requirements: at least 8/64, resonable stable for normal usage, doesn&#039;t need serial for flashing and recovery.<br />I know 4/32 works but it honestly does poorly today and given how software evolves it&#039;s not going to get smaller/more efficient anytime soon. I&#039;m not going into the holy war about programming but that&#039;s just how it is today.<br />Hardware should be available and have case, there&#039;s no point in recommend something like the WRT54GL even if its free for general usage nowdays. I think regional availability shouldn&#039;t be needed in consideration.</p><p>As I also mentioned, if you&#039;re an advanced user you aren&#039;t going to need that page at all (which is also mentioned at the bottom). You have very nice platforms that OpenWrt supports but they aren&#039;t always very user friendly (bare boards comes to mind or models which you have to disassemble and use serial). I honestly think you&#039;re going to find more use cases where ppl have a router in a case just working than someone having a bare broad and have to thinker with it frequently. </p><p>Am I being totally unreasonable? :-)</p><p>I personally think Buyers&#039; Guide kinda misses where my aim is at, it&#039;s great as a checklist if you actually know what you&#039;re looking for. However, if you&#039;re not I think a general list isn&#039;t such a bad idea given that above criterias.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>diizzy</strong> on 10 Apr 2016, 20:14)</p>

					<p>Indeed, avoid doing manual labor would be a very handy feature indeed but we do lack a few parameters.
