					<p>Well, I made some progress.</p><p>I have a working build on the latest trunk with binutils 2.21.1 and GCC 4.5 w/Linaro.</p><p>The default config (binutils 2.20.x) didn&#039;t work and produced firmwares that wouldn&#039;t boot or freeze up early in the boot process.</p><p>This thing is really responsive with config_hz set to 250 and voluntary preemption. I&#039;m not sure why the defaults are config_hz=100 and no-preemption.</p><p>It seems this router doesn&#039;t like full preemption, the swconfig software can&#039;t handle it (it&#039;s a bug that should be fixed).</p><p>The ethernet driver also fails to respond if I set config_hz to 1000.</p><p>I may patch the kernel to try 500Hz.</p>									</div>
