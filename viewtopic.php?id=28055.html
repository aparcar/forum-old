					<p>Table of hardware does not list an entry for the Actiontec MI424-WR revisions E, F, or G. Is anyone working on a firmware image for these? If so, what is the status? I don&#039;t mean to bug or nag, I&#039;m simply curious as to whether anyone is working on this? Is there anything I can do to help? I have a revision F unit, a medium to advanced understanding of Linux and shell commands, and basic understanding of programming concepts.</p><p>I would love to get it running OpenWRT, and I&#039;m not afraid to help out in the process of obtaining it.</p>									</div>

Some are mentioned here:</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MI424WR">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MI424WR</a></p><p>In case of the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-300">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-300</a>&nbsp; Version_A and Version_B are completely different. As with this device: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd</a> there are only little differences between Version 1.1 and 1.8</p><br /><p>If there are FOSS drivers for the hardware, support could come very quickly. If you need to fool around with proprietary shit, it could take a while. I couldn&#039;t even tell you how many developers the project has.</p><p>I mean, this device offers some quite unique features at the moment: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/asusrt-n16">http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/asusrt-n16</a> and is still not completely supported by OpenWrt. Because for a long time, no developer owned such a device. And also there are some issues with proprietary stuff needed. But I can&#039;t tell you exactly.</p>									</div>

					<p>Revisions E, F, and G, have a Dual-Core, 64-Bit MIPS CPU, More RAM, and a USB 2.0 port. I have the CD that came with it, and that has the Jungo compiler toolchain for this platform, and the source code. This all an be obtained from Actiontec&#039;s GPL site, except for the JPKG file which is corrupt if you download from there.</p>									</div>

					<p>Is there a developer in the southern California area interested in working on getting openwrt functional this device?</p><p>I have my router back now. I had previously loaned it out to someone. If there is someone nearby Whittier, Ca., who is willing to pick it up, and test with it, they are welcome to it, so long as they can bring it back when done. I could meet somewhere nearby, but it would have to be somewhere really close - I don&#039;t have a car.</p><p>I suppose I could try to mail it, but I&#039;d rather not if I don&#039;t have to. I have a Revision F device. Revisions E, F, and G, have completely different hardware than revisions A-D.</p>									</div>
