					<p>Hey guys my buddy wrote this QoS script and I wanted to use it on my OpenWRT router. He uses it on a box at home (full linux firewall) and says it works EXCELLENT. It also does wonders for his VOIP, he says. It classifies TCP and TCP ACK packets and puts them at a lower priority to UDP packets. This allows gaming and VOIP to work perfectly fine while uploading and downloading, or using bit torrent.</p><p>My problem is that it won&#039;t work on my router. I get some strange errors:</p><br /><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/jffs# ./throttle
