					<p>Hey guys.&nbsp; I&#039;ve installed OpenWrt on my Linksys WRTSL54GS as well as a bunch of ipkg components.&nbsp; I&#039;ve gotten to the point where I have installed everything I need (php, sqlite libraries, tinyproxy, lighttpd, veronica files), however this last reboot resulted in the web interface being removed.</p><p>Checking httpd file results in the string</p><p>httpd -p 90 -h www -r OpenWrt</p><p>Now I have been told the port was changed to port 90 from port 80, so I&#039;ve tried to access the router at 192.168.200.1 (lan ip) and nothing is responding.&nbsp; I tried 192.168.200.1:90 and nothing.&nbsp; I can still ssh into the router and scp stuff up via WinSCP but am at a loss as to how to fix this problem.&nbsp; </p><p>Anyone?</p>									</div>

					<p>Try typing full address into your web browser: <a href="http://192.168.200.1:90">http://192.168.200.1:90</a><br />Http:// is a part of the address, but browsers will insert that into url for you, but only IF port is 80.</p>									</div>
