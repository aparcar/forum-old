					<p>I have a Gateworks router board mounted with its initial settings of Backfire 10.3 with ip address 192.168.1.1. The router is connected with a PC, whose ip is 192.168.1.3.&nbsp; The version of Backfire may not be a &quot;vanilla version&quot; because it comes along with the Gateworks board.</p><p>The ping from PC to the router works perfectly, but the reverse direction does not. I tried to ping from the router to PC using &quot;ping 192.168.1.3&quot;, all the packets were lost. However, if I use scp on the router like:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>scp root@192.168.1.3:XXX YYY</code></pre></div><p>, it can work.</p><p>I think the connection between the router and the PC is good since the ping and the scp can work. Is there any possible settings that block the ping from the router to the PC?</p><p>Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>VincentGW</strong> on 31 Aug 2011, 22:59)</p>

					<p>Does anyone know this? I think it should be some default settings that block the ping from the router to the PC because I have not changed anything since I got the new board. I just don&#039;t know where the setting is ...</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

Would you please do me a favor to post the link if you find a solution to my problem.</p><p>Another thing is that the wiki is for Openwrt. There is some introduction about the initial settings on the first boot, but that is for Openwrt clean installation. I have installed a clean Openwrt on another Gateworks board before and the ping worked two-way perfectly. But what I mentioned in the first post is about a new Gateworks board with pre-installed Openwrt. It may have some initial settings introduced by Gateworks that block the ping. I am new to Openwrt and Linux so any direct answer or indirect clue will help</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
