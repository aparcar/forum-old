					<p>I followed this guide and am using the same AD233BK board (albeit a newer version):<br /><a href="http://www.rwhitby.net/projects/wrt54gs/">http://www.rwhitby.net/projects/wrt54gs/</a></p><p>Hardware:<br />Everything seems to be OK as far as wiring is concerned.&nbsp; I had initially reversed the tx and rx, but I corrected it.&nbsp; I have taken an ohm meter to almost the entire schematic with relation to the 2nd port.&nbsp; The 1st port (serial WRT console) works flawlessly.</p><p>Software:<br />I am using minicom -o (no modem commands).&nbsp; I have it setup to use /dev/tts/1 at 9600 8N1 with no flow control (have also tried it with software flow control).&nbsp; Running the latest Kamikaze.</p><p>Remote device:<br />Cisco 2514 console port set at 9600 bps.<br />The Cisco router works fine connected to my PC serial port.<br />I don&#039;t have anything else to test with besides the router, but I tried connecting both serial ports together with a null modem cable.&nbsp; I used stty -F /dev/tts/1 speed 115200 to set it to 115200 temporarily and still had no luck.</p><p>The odd part is, if I connect the rollover cable to my serial port, I no longer get output when I type in minicom, whereas if I unplug it, I seem to get a local echo (characters type but no line returns).</p><p>This is a last resort as I feel like I&#039;ve checked everything.&nbsp; If anyone else has seen this problem and can give any ideas, then by all means.</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br />JR</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sarcaz</strong> on 3 Oct 2007, 07:30)</p>

					<p>I also followed Rod Whitby&#039;s Howto and managed to get the first serial port (/dev/tts/0) working but have so far failed to get the second (/dev/tts/1) working. I just noticed the following kernel messages from dmesg:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Serial driver version 5.05c (2001-07-08) with MANY_PORTS SHARE_IRQ SERIAL_PCI ed
ttyS00 at 0xb8000300 (irq = 3) is a 16550A                                      
ttyS01 at 0xb8000400 (irq = 0) is a 16550A</code></pre></div><p>This is odd, since /proc/interrupts says nothing about interrupt 0</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>           CPU0                                                                 
  3:       1738            MIPS  gpio, serial                                   
  4:          0            MIPS  eth1                                           
  5:       1086            MIPS  eth0

ERR:          0</code></pre></div><p>So, what does it mean that ttyS01 (which I assume is the same as /dev/tts/1) has an irq of 0? Does it mean that it&#039;s disabled or that the irq needs to be configured manually? I have two routers, a WRT54G v2.2 and a WRT54GL v1.1, and both have the same messages about serial ports, though I&#039;ve only modified the WRT54G so far.</p>									</div>

I discovered that Rod Whitby&#039;s Howto seems to reverse the receive and transmit wires for the second port. I looked up the specs for the chip I received in the kit (a Sipex SP233AEP) and wired the RX and TX lines for the second port accordingly. Now, both of my ports work. There&#039;s great potential for confusion relating to the DTE/DCE model, since it&#039;s often not clear which a device should be. The chip doesn&#039;t really care, but just has two drivers in each direction.</p><p>I also discovered that while the kernel reports that ttyS00 is using irq 3 and ttyS01 irq 0, they should both be using irq 3. Until I made that change, the second port (ttyS01 or /dev/tts/1) would only reliably work at about 9600 bps. The OpenWRT setserial package has an initscript to set this, but I didn&#039;t reboot after installing it, so I didn&#039;t initially realize this.</p>									</div>
