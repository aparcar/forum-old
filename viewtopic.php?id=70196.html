					<p>Sorry, do you want to reference what guide you were using and version of Openwrt you were trying to install? That would probably help us quite a bit. There are really a lot of different ways of doing virtualization.. One thing that comes to mind with problems like these is compatibility with drive types. You may want to try basically removing the virtual drive from the virtual Sata controller and trying to attach it instead to a virtual IDE controller. That can sometimes help with grub boot issues.</p><p>A good spot to just start on though would probably be just confirming that the IMG you are using for this has the same MD5/SHA256 sum as what is listed on the server. To do this in windows 10, you can shift-right-click in the folder where you have the original downloaded image and then click on &quot;open command window here&quot;. After that, type in <em>CertUtil -hashfile filename.tar.gz MD5</em> . If the MD5 sum generated doesn&#039;t match the md5sum listed on the server you&#039;ll know you have a corrupt download.</p>									</div>

					<p>OH! haha Well that&#039;s good! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>Just so you know, if you are wanting to find an MD5sum of one of the openwrt files, they are generaly in the same place you downloaded the Image. So bassically, if your link says<br />www . filehost . com / openwrt-xx.xx.x.img.gz then the md5sum file would be under www . filehost . com / . I hope that helps in the future!</p><p>PS: I hope that this wasn&#039;t considered against the rules kind Mods of the forum. ^^;;&nbsp; I didn&#039;t post any actual links..</p>									</div>
