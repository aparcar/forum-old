With that, I can create AP and client interfaces that work simultaneously, but there is definitely no WDS on that firmware.

So if you&#039;re using a dsl modem or some other thing that requires a login to configure, leave your old router in place and just chain through all of them (make sure that the old router is set to a network OTHER than 192.168.1.0).</p><p>I.e.; plug dsl modem into old router wan port, old router lan port to c7 wan port, c7 lan port to laptop or something.</p><p>If you&#039;re using a cable modem or other network that &quot;just works&quot;, then you can just straight up replace the old router with the c7.</p>									</div>

					<p>You can use Archer C7 v1 firmware with WDR7500 v2. However, you need to flash OpenWrt in between, since the GUI of WDR7500 won&#039;t accept C7 firmware and vice versa. From OpenWrt you can then flash C7 firmware with mtd.</p>									</div>

Specifically, they source different brands of flash and ram. The 7500v2 has cFeon flash (vs Winbond on c7v1) and Hynix ram (vs Winbond on c7v1). There really is no telling what else they might source differently on foreign devices.</p><p>Though we can reasonably GUESS that the wdr7500v3 is likely to be almost the same as c7v2, there is no way to actually tell without more information about it, or someone actually buying one.</p><p>There may also be a tell in the factory firmware, the presence of which would almost guarantee that they are the same. If it is missing the tell, it does NOT mean that they are necessarily different however.</p><p>If you can find the factory firmware and look at the 4 bytes starting at address 0x40, it contains the model and hardware version of the matching device. Archer c7v2 contains the values &quot;c7000002&quot;.</p><p>c7v1 had the value 75000001. Note the &quot;7500&quot; matching the wdr7500.</p><p>My gut tells me that the wdr7500v3 will *probably* have &quot;75000003&quot;, which is, of course, inconclusive.</p><p>If you can find/provide more information about the device, it would be helpful in identifying it better.

structure consisting of a &#039;standard&#039; kernel/rootfs image within a
larger image as shown below.

-----------------------------------------
|     |     |                           |
|     |     |    -------------------    |

|     |     |                           |
-----------------------------------------</code></pre></div><p>So is possible to strip the bootloader part from the image by simply deleting it from the binary file, resulting in a plain rootfs/kernel image that can be flashed directly through the Archer C7 web interface without changing the bootloader. I&#039;ve done it several times without problems, but, as always, you have to do it at your own risk...</p><p>To strip the bootloader part of the image, you can open the binary image in an HEX editor (like HxD in Windows), and search for the second ASCII &quot;TP-LINK Technologies&quot; ocurrence, which will be in the header of the kernel image. Before the string, you&#039;ll see the 4 bytes version field, which should be 01 00 00 00). This is the exact point where the bootloader section ends and the kernel image starts, so you only need to strip all the data before it to obtain a binary image without bootloader. I&#039;ve done this procedure with several versions, and the kernel image always starts at 0x20200, so stripping the data between 0x0 and 0x201FF will make it. </p><p>I hope this info can help you.</p><p>Best Regards,</p>									</div>
