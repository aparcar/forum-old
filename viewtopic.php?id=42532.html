					<p>I have a problem with DHCP on my WRT54G running OpenWRT Backfire.</p><p>In my setup, I have a WRT54G as main router, DHCP server and AP, connected to the DSL modem. A second AP (TP-Link 1043ND running stock firmware) is connected to the WRT54G by a LAN cable. Both APs have the same SSID and security settings.<br />I can connect my Android phone to the TP-Link AP. It receives an IP and everything works as expected. I can also connect my phone to the WRT54G, also this way works. But when my phone was connected to the WRT54G, and I move to the range of the TP-Link, it doesn&#039;t receive an IP address anymore. Bringing the phone back to the range of the WRT54G works, the phone can get an IP then.</p><p>Using wireshark on a PC connected to the wired switch of the WRT54G, I can see the phone sending DHCP requests, but OpenWRT does not answer...<br />Even a reboot of the router does not help. Only after a power cycle, the WRT54G starts to respond on the DHCP requests again.<br />Somehow it seems that if a device received a DHCP lease over WLAN, it can not get a (new or renewed) lease over the LAN ports anymore.</p><p>Has anybody an idea how to solve this?</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s not the rebinding trap is it? I have seen warning messages about that when I switch between my two WIFI networks when testing although it did not stop me getting an IP.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi DB1,</p><p>thank you for your reply. Could you explain a little bit more what the &#039;rebinding trap&#039; is? I have already searched a lot in the forums and wiki, but did not find a reference to this so far.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t really know. I don&#039;t have any logs around with the messages in any more. I know I was getting a warning message when switching between wifi networks. There is this option on the DHCP setup page in the GUI</p><p>Rebind protection&nbsp; &nbsp; Discard upstream RFC1918 responses</p><p>But I have no idea, or could find, what it is about. Sorry</p>									</div>
