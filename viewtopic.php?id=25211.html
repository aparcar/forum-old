					<p>Hi there!</p><p>After I installed OpenWRT on my Linksys WRT160NL - <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-wrt160nl-squashfs.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … uashfs.bin</a> this one. Everything went perfectly, but when I tried to configure the internet connection I saw, that there is no /etc/config/network. After that, a very foolish idea: maybe its not present - yet. So I created the file: touch /etc/config/network, then wrote the config to the file: <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># cat &gt;/etc/config/network
   config interface loopback
      option ifname lo
      option proto static
      option ipaddr 127.0.0.1
      option netmask 255.0.0.0

   config interface lan
      option ifname eth0
      option type bridge
      option proto static
      option ipaddr 192.168.1.1

       option ifname eth1</code></pre></div><p>Closed the file with Ctrl-D then rebooted the router.</p><p>Since that, the router is unreachable, not even shows on tracerout. The connected devices can see each other. And of course, there is no Internet connection through the router.</p><p>Any way to reset it?</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>estol</p><p>update: RTFM - <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt160nl#boot.into.failsafe.mode">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt … lsafe.mode</a> - works once more... supermassive fail from me -,-</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>estol</strong> on 10 Jun 2010, 22:00)</p>

					<p>Hi,<br />try fail-safe mode ..check for ping&#039;s... and do a TFTP flash while it boots.<br />you can check the TFTP mode .. by doing a continuous ping to 192.168.1.1 while you power up the router.. you can check<br />if the ping works then your router is alive.</p><p>you can try telnet, ssh .. too.</p><p>if none of these work then you can try the serial connection to your router using a CA-42 cable, remember its 3.3v serial connection.</p>									</div>

					<p>s4ndr0 and Dogge, have you connected your cable to the router yet or are you just testing the ca-42 cable? I managed to solder 4 wires to the serial pins, then connected a dku-5 cable to it, and my serial connection is working fine. I can&#039;t help much because I don&#039;t know the pinout of ca-42, but I&#039;ll try to update the wr741nd wiki page with the information regarding the serial access. Hopefully it will make it easier for you guys and others since failsafe mode doesn&#039;t work for this tp-link model.</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr741nd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr741nd</a></p><p>Check back for more update.</p>									</div>

					<p>to test CA-42 you can take the following , try shorting two wires to check which combination of it is rx/tx..<br />when you short the wires you can type in console connected to it. you should see your typed stuff echoed back to you.</p><p>next.. <br /> most CA 42 have 3rd wire gnd, while some have gnd and power.. a simple multimeter would do the trick if there were two more wires..<br />else the only remaining one is always gnd.</p>									</div>

					<p>Should work. You know the Rx and Tx cables but don&#039;t know which is which, and with a ca-42 cable you need Rx, Tx and Gnd connected. So have Rx and Tx connected and try each of the other 4 cables until it works. If it doesn&#039;t work, switch the Rx and Tx cables, and try each of the other 4 cables until it works. You have a 1 in 8 shot of getting it right.</p><p>Have a look at the wiki.
