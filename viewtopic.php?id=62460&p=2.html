					<p>Just a suggestion to all.&nbsp; It may be a good idea to cycle through all three configurations (bridge, router, gateway) and perform the system update (sh /sbin/fw_update via putty or via web gui) and back up your configuration under &quot;system | backup config&quot; for archiving just in case your shield gets corrupted somehow.&nbsp; Thanks everyone for taking the initiative in moving as much data over to this new forum.&nbsp; It will come in handy in the future.</p>									</div>

					<p>For Reference: Cron job to reboot </p><p>Searching further, OpenWRT doesn&#039;t have the shutdown command as sk3ch points out (Thanks sk3ch!), but has a reboot command instead...</p><p>Looking through the OpenWRT documentation, it appears there are additional considerations like no RTC. So there is a recommendation to use this:</p><p># Reboot at 4:30am every day<br /># Note: To avoid infinite reboot loop, wait 70 seconds<br /># and touch a file in /etc so clock will be set<br /># properly to 4:31 on reboot before cron starts.<br />30 4 * * * sleep 70 &amp;&amp; touch /etc/banner &amp;&amp; reboot</p><p>(source: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/cron?s">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/cron?s</a>[]=reboot)</p><p>But, since I only want to reboot once a week, I&#039;ve changed my chron to do this:<br />0 4 * * 0 sleep 70 &amp;&amp; touch /etc/banner &amp;&amp; reboot</p><p>This *should* reboot on Sunday night at 4 am. Note that I confirmed /etc/banner *does* exist in the Shield&#039;s structure.</p><p>For future reference, cron information from the LuCI GUI is stored in the file &quot;/etc/crontabs/root&quot;.</p><br /><p>edit: Based on positive feedback from sk3ch, I&#039;m going to try running daily. The code for that is:</p><p>0 4 * * * sleep 70 &amp;&amp; touch /etc/banner &amp;&amp; reboot</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Wisiwyg</strong> on 31 Jan 2016, 20:09)</p>

I&#039;m really sad to hear about Itus going under. Great people and a great product idea.

Forgive my ignorance if I&#039;m posting in the wrong place.</p><p>My shield (router mode) stopped working two days ago. No reason, just stopped.

So obviously something is wrong</p><p>I&#039;m very appreciative of any troubleshooting suggestions you can provide</p><p>However, if Itus is no longer, will Shield still get regular 3rd party updates (similar to virus definition updates)? If the current ones will become obsolete, and I cannot get new updates, is there a point in resurrecting my shield (?)</p><p>thanks for your insights and kind regards,<br />-Rob</p></blockquote></div><p>Hi Rob!</p><p>Firstly, yes, if you&#039;re on 1.51 with the latest fw_upgrade script then Shield will continue to get updates for malicious sites for IPS rules. These are being pulled from rules.emergeingthreats.net, an open source Snort rules provider, with the rules being updated daily at emergingthreats. So yes, I&#039;d recommend resurrecting your Shield! </p><p>What you described sounds like Snort is not starting. In Router Mode, Shield will still pass internet if Snort doesn&#039;t start - traffic just won&#039;t get filtered. In Bridge mode, traffic is passed through Snort like a soft switch. The fact that you&#039;re getting into the interface through the .111 interface, but no traffic is what points me to a Snort problem.</p><p>Try going into the Status, System Log file from the LuCI interface and scroll to the bottom. You&#039;re looking for FATAL ERROR, something like the problem described below...</p><br /><p>After the upgrade, the system was not connecting. Searching through the logs I found this:</p><p>Sun Jan 24 10:01:38 2016 daemon.notice snort[10282]: WARNING: /etc/snort/rules/snort.rules(4349) GID 1 SID 2404000 in rule duplicates previous rule. Ignoring old rule.</p><p>Sun Jan 24 10:01:38 2016 daemon.err snort[10282]: FATAL ERROR: /etc/snort/rules/snort.rules(4349) threshold (in rule): could not create threshold - only one per sig_id=2404000.<br />Sun Jan 24 10:01:38 2016 daemon.info procd: Instance snort::instance1 s in a crash loop 6 crashes, 3 seconds since last crash</p><p>I searched through /etc/snort/snort.rules and found this entry listed twice:</p><p>drop tcp $HOME_NET any -&gt; [103.225.168.222,104.131.93.109,104.144.167.131,104.144.167.132,104.161.17.17,104.238.141.230,104.238.147.212,106.187.48.236,106.187.99.92,107.161.19.71] any (msg:&quot;ET CNC Shadowserver Reported CnC Server TCP group 1&quot;; flags:S; reference:url,doc.emergingthreats.net/bin/view/Main/BotCC; reference:url,www.shadowserver.org; threshold: type limit, track by_src, seconds 3600, count 1; classtype:trojan-activity; flowbits:set,ET.Evil; flowbits:set,ET.BotccIP; sid:2404000; rev:4109;)</p><p>I commented out the first instance, saved, restarted snort and watched the log. Then this:</p><p>Sun Jan 24 10:09:38 2016 daemon.notice snort[10989]: WARNING: /etc/snort/rules/snort.rules(4350) GID 1 SID 2404001 in rule duplicates previous rule.

While the log indicates the earlier (old) rule is ignored, it looks like it still causes a fatal exception preventing snort from starting.</p><p>Is there a backup of the snort rules stored on the system that I can replace the corrupt file with? Or, is the snort.rules file available for download alone? I don&#039;t want to go through this exercise of finding one, commenting out, restarting, to see if there&#039;s another one duplicated. It might be as simple as going to the first duplicate instance and deleting everything beneath it.</p><p>Also, the script goes to rules.emergingthreats.net to dl update files. That site is blocked by Norton connectsafe, which is running as a DNS filter on my router. Shield would never get to the site to dl a new ruleset.</p><p>Further update....</p><p>I walked through the snort.rules file and found where it looked like the original fileset had duplicated itself on top. I selected what appeared to be the duplicates and deleted them from the file, effectively the top half of the file&#039;s data.</p><p>I then went to the router and cleared rules.emergingthreats.net to allow it to pass the DNS filter - basically changed filter providers to Yandex and then navigated to rules.emergingthreats.net to ensure it would pass.</p><p>I then restarted Snort. Everything came back up and I had internet access.</p><p>I then SSH&#039;d into Shield and manually kicked off fw_upgrade. Everything processed, the system log didn&#039;t list a fatal exception. It appears to be running as expected now, except I still received a couple of errors on the script:</p><p>rm: can&#039;t remove &#039;/tmp/ads.tmp&#039; : No such file or directory<br />rm: can&#039;t remove &#039;/tmp/malicious.tmp&#039; : No such file or directory</p><p>Even though it works fine with those errors, I would expect those to exist as I looked through the script and it tries to pull rules for them. I haven&#039;t looked at the server to confirm that there are or are not rules available for the script to pull to create those files, though. But for now, I have internet running through Shield again.</p></blockquote></div><br /><p>Hi Wisiwyg --&nbsp; thanks again for your kind efforts to bail me out, and keep the community going. Looking at the admin interface via 10.10.10.10, I&#039;m on v1.51. However, the last time the unit indicates update was Nov 28! Yeesh. I assumed it had been updating itself, but apparently not.&nbsp; So perhaps I&#039;m three steps behind being able to use the above!&nbsp; Other suggestions would be most welcome. Thank you!</p>									</div>

					<p>I am not keeping track with the discussion here. I sure would like to know if the company ever did release its firmware source to include all the in-house (proprietary) drivers and/or software packages. If so, I would not know if anyone here has ever tried to successfully compile OpenwRT firmware from the source released by the company for the ITUs Shield Pro product.</p>									</div>
