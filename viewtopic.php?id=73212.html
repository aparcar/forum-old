					<p>I&#039;d start with trying to wake it from openwrt. Install etherwake package, ssh to your router and run<br />etherwake -i eth1 -D a5:31:ac:91:10:01<br />(this is actually how I wake my systems behing openwrt - way more secure and reliable). Make sure to use correct interface, it usually does not work when you do not specify any.</p><p>Edit: I think you need to forward also port 7 and you only need udp, not tcpudp.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 10 Feb 2018, 19:41)</p>

					<p>You don&#039;t wan&#039;t to ssh, but want to make it work, right? So you&#039;ll have to. ;-) You have to make sure you can wake your device from the router, or you can play with routing magic packets all day long to finally realize, that there&#039;s something wrong and the device won&#039;t wake up for whatever reason.</p><p>Another approach might be to run script on the router, which will check some web page with your php script every minute or so, and if it finds you want to wake up, it can execute etherwake. This is what I do on LTE links, which do not have public IPs. You can also run perl or php script on your router which can launch etherwake on your command directly, if you can access your router from internet, there are many ways how you can trigger etherwake if routing of magic packets fail, but you will have to ssh first :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, that would work, no doubt. But I&#039;d like to fix the initial problem, a matter of static IP.<br />And that would go along with the other similar settings via other routers (office for instance)</p><p>The simple magic packet routing should go through: </p><p>- again the UDP packet goes to the PC - when it&#039;s UP (seen using tcpdump)<br />&nbsp; reason being that the router&#039;s ARP query gets an answer, since the PC is running</p><p>- it&#039;s a matter of the router seeing a static IP linked to a MAC address</p><p>- and, the two methods (/etc/ethers+readethers, or &#039;config host&#039;) make the router set a &#039;00:00...00&#039; MAC linked to that IP, instead of the correct MAC</p><p>I was thinking the reason to that 00:00...00 is maybe because the PC address is fixed and is not part of the DHCP IP range?</p><p>Or i&#039;ll have to go through the code again to see what&#039;s wrong (takes lots of space and download+compile time, would like to avoid that).</p>									</div>

					<p>Offline device does not care about IP, it has only its MAC so you have to wake the mac. I never tried to route magic packets, because I do it the way you don&#039;t like ;-) But I use it daily on many sites and it works perfectly. I have to ssh to router anyway, because I use it for ssh tunneling to the remote network, so when I&#039;m there, I run etherwake before trying to rdp or whatever to the PCs inside the remote lan.</p><p>WOL can be tricky even on local network, so that&#039;s why I&#039;d debug the way I suggested.

					<p><em>&gt; Have you tried to wake the pc from other device on the same lan?</em></p><p>Yes, and it works. <br />Works also: using another router supporting the WoL broadcast (since it broadcast to all IPs on the same LAN)</p><p><em>&gt; Offline device does not care about IP, it has only its MAC so you have to wake the mac</em></p><p>Not totally exact.<br />Since the router cannot broadcast the packet (at least I don&#039;t know how to), the usual IP to IP com is used.<br />But that wouldn&#039;t work since PC is Off.<br />But what we just need is the router to throw that packet on the LAN... and router wouldn&#039;t do that since the requested IP does not answer (via ARP).<br />But if we give the router a static IP / MAC association, it doesn&#039;t need the ARP query response and will just write that magic packet on the line.</p><p>The actual IP address is not used effectively ; the static IP link is just to make the router happy and put the packet on the Ethernet wire, would the IP be alive or not.</p><p>However, and this is the problem, the router doesn&#039;t seem to memorize that IP&lt;&gt;MAC association, and set the MAC to zeroes.</p>									</div>

					<p>I see. If that&#039;s so. I don&#039;t have deep technical knowlege about how it works, so maybe it&#039;s totally stupid idea, but what about forwarding to option &#039;dest_ip&#039; &#039;whatever_your_broadcast_IP_is&#039;? ;-) Btw. have you both ports forwarded (7,9)?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 11 Feb 2018, 15:01)</p>

					<p>If you can wake on port 9 on local lan, maybe you don&#039;t have to forward 7. I read somewhere both are used, but as I always use wol only from openwrt to local lan, I never cared too much about how it really works. You can also try to forward to broadcast ip 224.0.0.0, but that&#039;s about all I can advice you, good luck.</p>									</div>
