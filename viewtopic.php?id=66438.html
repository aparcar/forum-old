					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a couple of devices running AR9331 (and some others running atheros QCA9533-AL3A) and I would like to extend the wifi signal using WDS. I&#039;ve read that as long as devices are same manufacturer (exact chipset?) I can set up WDS which would nicely bind the devices network on Layer 2. The only concern I have is: can I set same SSID and password (same as master-WDS they are connecting to) for all client-WDS devices to benefit from wifi-clients&#039; roaming capabilities? Won&#039;t this brake something?</p><p>Perhaps this might pose problems in multiple WDS-clients scenario but might work in one master - one repeater scenario?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nobody2600</strong> on 26 Jul 2016, 00:53)</p>

					<p>We use WDS in that config.</p><p>The master and the &quot;repeater&quot; both have the exact same SSID, security, and password, and devices will roam from one to the other.&nbsp; Although the &quot;roaming&quot; is mostly a function of the client device.&nbsp; Some do it better then others.</p><p>Everything works as it should, and all clients on both devices can see each other, and access the internet via the master.</p>									</div>
