					<p>Hello,</p><p>yesterday I destroey my TP-Link TL-WR1043ND Router. First I had an OpenWRT running. Then I flashed with the Webinterface to DD-WRT. And then I tried to flash to OpenWRT again. The webinterface said &quot;upgrade failed&quot;. Then I didi it with mdt. Obviously mdt flashed the firmware and something went wrong.<br />Now when the Router is running, all LEDs (except Power LEDs) are flashing continuously. The Power LED is always on.<br />A new flash with tftp didn&#039;t work. I think, the bootloader doesn&#039;t start up, because the router doesn&#039;t answer on pings, when reconnecting the power supply. Before I flashed the router it did answer on pings.</p><p>Has anyone an idea how I could reanimate the router?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, sending firmware image over tftp never worked with TL-WR1043ND. Tftp method mainly works with broadcom devices (CFE bootloader).&nbsp; To unbrick you&#039;ll need serial console, read the wiki <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd#serial">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd#serial</a></p>									</div>
