					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I have 2x Ubiquiti Bullet M2 HP devices that I would like to setup as a hotspot. I really want to run OpenWRT but am having trouble getting the firmware to take. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Here is where I am at:</p><p>Device 2:<br />- Started with Firmware AirOS XM 5.6.8<br />- Downgraded to AirOS XM 5.5.11<br />- Downgraded to AirOS XM 5.3.6 (the re-release version with all MAC address support, for newer devices)<br />- Device works fine with AirOS XM 5.3.6<br />- Installed OpenWRT (openwrt-ar71xx-generic-ubnt-bullet-m-squashfs-factory) via Update in UBNT Web Management, left for 20min, rebooted device, no IP-address given by DHCP server. No IP found assigned using IPScan.<br />- Recovery mode - TFTP, back to AirOS XM 5.3.6, left for 20 min, rebooted, back to 192.168.1.20<br />- Installed OpenWRT (openwrt-ar71xx-generic-ubnt-bullet-m-squashfs-factory) via Recovery TFTP method, status = success, left for 20 min, rebooted, no IP-address given by DHCP server. No IP found assigned using IPScan.<br />- Recovery mode - TFTP, back to AirOS XM 5.3.6, left for 20 min, rebooted, back to 192.168.1.20<br />- Installed OpenWRT (openwrt-ar71xx-generic-ubnt-bullet-m-squashfs-factory) via SSH terminal. Again, installed fine, left for 20 min, rebooted, no IP-address given by DHCP server. No IP found assigned using IPScan.</p><p>Device 1:<br />- Pretty sure I bricked it because I didn&#039;t downgrade the AirOS before applying the OpenWRT firmware.<br />- Is there anything I can do? It still goes to recovery mode. But AirOS 5.6.8 says installed, but doesn&#039;t boot. Have not tried all the different AirOS firmwares.</p><p>Not sure where to go next. I don&#039;t want to brick device 2. </p><p>Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jamesgid</strong> on 12 Aug 2016, 05:29)</p>

					<p>We just downgraded to 5.5.11, and OpenWRT installed fine.&nbsp; Not sure why you need to go back to 5.3.6, never tried it.</p><p>You can save your bricked device, but you need to open it up, and have a serial-USB adapter to access the serial console.&nbsp; See:</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=64326">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=64326</a></p><p>There is also a patch available to solve the problem so you can flash directly on 5.6.x, but it has not been backported into CC as far as I know.&nbsp; Info in the above link.</p>									</div>

I will try the OpenWRT install from 5.5.11 and see what happens.</p><p>I had a heap of Serial to USB adapters with all my hobby stuff at home.

I knew the information had to be out there somewhere.</p><p>Can you confirm which firmware image you applied to your Bullet?

					<p>Also, I am at factory defaults in the AirOS before applying the OpenWRT firmware. Should I be changing anything prior to uploading the OpenWRT firmware, like network settings?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>No need to change from factory default on AirOS, no.</p><p>Regarding Openwrt firmware, this is the latest stable.&nbsp; Likely what you were using.</p><p><a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05.1/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-15.05.1-ar71xx-generic-ubnt-bullet-m-squashfs-factory.bin">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal â€¦ actory.bin</a></p><br /><p>We build our own, but based on CC 15.05.1, so the above should be fine.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks JohnV.</p><p>Turns out my n00b status to OpenWRT brought me undone. I missed the whole static IP of 192.168.1.1 being default, and no web interface by default. Worked it all out.</p><p>Now in regards to the bricked device, I can still get it into Recovery mode without the USB TTL adapter. In recovery mode I can ping it (192.168.1.20). Does that mean that it may not actually be properly &#039;bricked&#039; ! LOL, if there is such a thing!</p><p>When I upload the OpenWRT firmware, the ping of 192.168.1.20 continues which suggests the UBNT doesn&#039;t reboot. If I power cycle the device, I have nothing on 192.168.1.20 or 192.168.1.1.</p><p>I have the following lights:<br />- After TFTP Firmware upload<br />1 and 2 green<br />Then 3 and 5 alternate on and off with 4 and 6.</p><p>- After power cycle <br />1 Solid<br />2 has activity<br />Then after about 30 seconds I get a quick flash on 4 and 5, then 2 goes out completely for about 3 seconds, then back to activity. Looks like it is soft rebooting.</p><p>Does that paint a picture for anybody, and if so, what do I need to do to get this device working again?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Does the Alfa TUBE2H have the same circuit board as the Bullet M2 HP?&nbsp; &nbsp; If so, or if not, has anyone ever seen a description of how to install the firmware &quot;TUBE2H&quot; from OpenWRT or do you know if it is indeed intended for an Alfa TUBE2H?</p>									</div>
