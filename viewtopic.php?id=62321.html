					<p>I use LuCI to configure my OpenWrt router. I&#039;ve recently used the tool under Network -&gt; DHCP and DNS -&gt; Static Leases to configure static leases and custom hostnames for all of the hosts on my network. I have provided the hostname, MAC address, and designated IP address for each host. On this same page, under Active DHCP Leases, I can see a list of all of the currently active DHCP Leases, including my designated hostnames for each one, but for the Active DHCPv6 Leases, no hostnames are showing up. That section looks like this:</p><p>Active DHCPv6 Leases<br />Hostname&nbsp; &nbsp; IPv6-Address&nbsp; &nbsp; DUID&nbsp; &nbsp; Leasetime remaining<br />?&nbsp; &nbsp; fd93:cbd6:157d::7af/128&nbsp; &nbsp; 000100011d2468810022413ae65c&nbsp; &nbsp; 10h 17m 41s<br />?&nbsp; &nbsp; fd93:cbd6:157d::a8b/128&nbsp; &nbsp; 000100011b0ba1a180006e5ca045&nbsp; &nbsp; 3h 8m 40s<br />?&nbsp; &nbsp; fd93:cbd6:157d::e92/128&nbsp; &nbsp; 000100011d63bafd68ae205b266f&nbsp; &nbsp; 9h 53m 1s</p><br /><p>Any idea how I can get the same hostnames that show in the Active DHCP Leases section to show up in the Active DHCPv6 Leases section? Does it have anything to do with the IPv6 Suffix field? I haven&#039;t filled this in since I&#039;m not sure what to put there.</p><p>Here&#039;s my system info:</p><p>Model&nbsp; &nbsp; TP-Link TL-WDR3600 v1<br />Firmware Version&nbsp; &nbsp; OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05 / LuCI (git-15.248.30277-3836b45)<br />Kernel Version&nbsp; &nbsp; 3.18.20</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>prwood</strong> on 22 Jan 2016, 23:20)</p>

Carefully watch the DUID being used. If the client isn&#039;t providing the router with a consistent DUID you&#039;ll need to configure the client to do so.</p><p>foolproof method: restart the router &amp; restart the client. Should see it assigned correctly.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cmeu</strong> on 8 Feb 2016, 02:01)</p>
