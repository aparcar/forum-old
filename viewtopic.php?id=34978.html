					<p>Hello, i have flashed mine TP-LINK WR741ND with original firmware from tp-link site. The main reason why i did this because my modem and whitebox haved IP conflict (192.168.1.1) Even modem IP address changing doesn&#039;t helped. So after tp-link reflash changed IP to 192.168.0.1 and everythink started to work. Yesterday found that SamKnows published source.</p><p>My question: it&#039;s possible in source change IP address, set wireless password and then compile ? (I didn&#039;t downloaded, because of slow speed, maybe after satisfied answer i will do that)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>suf3r</strong> on 24 Feb 2012, 08:02)</p>

Does your modem hand out local IPs on the network? Or do you use your modem only do dial in from your PC? Normally the Whitebox asks for an IP and uses whatever is given to it. And then it acts as a transparent bridge. Also, weird that you just flashed a different firmware then. What gave you that idea and why do you want to go back now?</p><p>However that may be. To simply configure the network, you don’t need to compile anything. You can simply put the box into <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr941nd#failsafe.mode">Failsafe Mode</a>, edit the /etc/config/network file and it will use that setting.</p><p>To flash the whitebox firmware back, pick on of the Samknows images from the GPL source tarball’s /bin subdirectory.</p>									</div>
