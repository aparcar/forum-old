					<p>I&#039;m an undergraduate. In my dormitory, I can directly plug the Ethernet Cable into my Windows PC to get IPv6 address, but I want to use the openwrt router. The auto-distributed IPv6 address&#039; prefix is /64 which means it can&#039;t be divide subnet (Is this right?) <br />Someone said that 6relayd could work. But after I install and configure it, the router get two IPv6 address.&nbsp; The openwrt version is Barrier Breaker 14.07 Final. <br />If 6relayd couldn&#039;t work, I know someone uses radvd and ndppd on a Attitude Adjustment router and it works. <br />Anybody knows what should I do now?</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZEWf3Ax.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/ZEWf3Ax.png" /></span></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Werner</strong> on 2 Oct 2014, 20:06)</p>
