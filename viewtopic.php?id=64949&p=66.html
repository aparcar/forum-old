					<p>@davidc502,<br />My issue reported against ssl\tls dissapered on Reboot (SNAPSHOT, r4049-9412fc2).<br />I am able to connect with openconnect, but vpnc-script won&#039;t work if I run openconnect from shell command. And I can&#039;t use luci to add openconnect interface, since I need 2FA (two factor auth) and --juniper option.<br />So i&#039;ve simply copied vpnc-script from my ubuntu machine and specify --script to openconnect to use it. Now I am able to connect and all routes get from server are there. Not sure that will work later when I&#039;ll run 3200 as main device. Will see later.</p><p>Didn&#039;t checked yet 5ghz, but I also have to purge 5ghz config and create it again so it&#039;s can start.</p><p>BTW, who like to have stock firmware on second partition, you have to run sysupgrade with option -F.
