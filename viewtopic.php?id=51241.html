					<p>Hello,</p><p>I installed openwrt (Attitude Adjustment 12.09) on a TL-WR841ND and the installation went through fine.</p><br /><p>But, I could not figure out how to setup a Dual Access PPPoE (also called &quot;Russia PPPoE&quot;) using luci(?).</p><p>Just wanted to check if anyone could please share their configuration.</p><p>Thanks<br />Joe</p><p>Below from the NetShe documentation (this is the only relevant documentation I could find about &quot;Dual Access PPPoE&quot;):</p><p>Dual Access<br />The term dual access is not used in NETSHe, although the mechanism, which is meant by<br />it by some manufacturers, is implemented in NETSHe<br />Dual access means a two-staged connection with the Internet service provider (uplink):<br />• connection to the provider through Ethernet-interface to assign an IP-address,<br />routes, etc. with DHCP or with static settings.<br />•connection with the use of the protocol group like “point-to-point”, (PPPoE, PPTP,<br />L2TP) on the second stage<br />Connection to the provider network is carried out through Ethernet-port ; an IP-address,<br />routes, name servers are assigned to the client by the provider. Upon completion of the<br />first stage of connection a client gets access to the internal resources of the provider, but<br />not to the Internet.<br />On the second stage the connection through PPTP or L2TP protocols is established with<br />the assignment of a new default route, new name servers and a new IP-address on the<br />new interface ( named pppX). Upon completion of the second stage a client obtains<br />access to the Internet. This two-staged connection is implemented in NETSHe, as shown<br />in the documentation examples</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>joe9</strong> on 24 Jun 2014, 21:27)</p>

					<p>Got it working. It was just PPPoE. Had to do the below:</p><p>add &quot;option macaddr xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx&quot; to the corresponding &quot;config interface&quot; section in /etc/config/network</p><p>The macaddr is the Wan HW Addr reported in the Status window of the Stock firmware.</p><p>Got the idea from:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=14687">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=14687</a><br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27524">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27524</a></p>									</div>
