The only that I know is that under Open-WRT with Atheros SoC, you can save this Atheros wireless calibration data or ART (&quot;Atheros Radio Test&quot;, Atheros wireless calibration data) with the following command:</p><p>#cat /proc/mtd<br />(and if it appears a parttion named: &quot;art&quot; or &quot;config&quot; then it is the partition with Atheros wireless calibration data)</p><p>#dd if=/dev/mtd5 of=/tmp/art.bin<br />(if &quot;mtd5&quot; is the partition with the wireless calibration data of your Atheros wireless chip, you will get a backup into a binary file &quot;art.bin&quot; with those wireless calibration data or ART)</p><p>OK, and now my question is a similar option to save the wireless calibration data of my RTL8225 wireless chip that I have into my wireless access point with Realtek RTL8186 cpu. </p><p>Then can anybody explain me how to save the wireless calibration data under RTL8186 platform?.</p><p>Because when you login means telnet or ssh under a RTL8186 firmware and you put:</p><p># cat /proc/mtd</p><p>&quot;mtd&quot; does not exist, then how can you know where is the wireless calibration data partition for saving into a binary file for backup of your RTL8225?.</p><p>That someone can answer me with some type of useful idea please.
