					<p>Is the Asus rt n65u well supported at this point? I have been using openwrt since the beginning and don&#039;t want to give that up. Unfortunately my wrt54g is dead after many years.</p>									</div>

					<p>I will take that into consideration. I was hoping for something with a usb port for extra space on the router.</p><p>This leads to me ask what is a good choice of router today for openwrt. The buffalo one seems decent but lacks some of the power of the asus one. Been browsing the hardware wiki for a better choice.</p>									</div>

					<p>From what do you deduct it is well supported? All I see on that wiki page is some hardware info. Nothing more. Not even a trunk revision that would have a certain level of support.</p>									</div>
