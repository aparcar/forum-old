					<p>First off let me say that I am completely new to flashing hardware - I&#039;ve never done it once in my life. Here are my basic requirements:</p><p>* Gigabit ethernet<br />* Hardware VLAN<br />* At least Wireless-n<br />* Low latency switching<br />* A small amount of extra installation space for one or two small daemons; knockd, vsftpd.</p><p>Since I will be playing games and downloading (legal) torrents (the torrent server will be running in a VLAN) - I will need a device that is powerful enough to provide reasonable latency when QOS is set up. This is the primary reason why I am purchasing new hardware - to obtain a sleek and secure set up. My current set up is anything but.</p><br /><p>Additional requirements:</p><p>* Pretty forgiving. ie. being able to unbrick the device. (since it is my first time)</p><p>Here is my candidate: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3800">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3800</a></p><p>It seems to fit the bill but perhaps you guys can shed more light on it; point out any problems I may encounter.</p><p>Any better suggestions would be appreciated.</p><br /><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>sure the Buffalo WZR-HP-AG300H or the D-Link DIR-825<br />but the DIR-825 has less ram and flash and the Buffalos bootloader has a quite short timewindows for tftp-uploads, and as one requirement was easy debricking I would go with the Netgear. Or if you have a small budget maybe the DIR-825. It has the same CPU and 64MB RAM and 8MB Flash is more than enough for knockd, vsftpd.</p>									</div>

I have a subscription to a VPN service that uses CBC 128bit blowfish. On average it will see about 2mbit download and 0.5mbit upload continuously; maxing at 8mbit down at peak.

					<p>8Mbit isn&#039;t a problem at all, blowfish performs even better than AES, so you have nothing to worry about. <br />Regarding latency and qos you should know that in the default configuration the qos-script adds a delay for the normal and bulk buckets. <br />So your low-latency traffic has to be priority or express, or you have to change configuration of the classes, but I&#039;m not sure how this will influence qos.</p><p>But the CPU will be fast enough for all of this. And a router with hardware crypto-acceleration won&#039;t help you either with blowfish, only with AES. You won&#039;t get anything faster router with good openwrt-support, unless you will use a PC, or something really expensive.</p>									</div>

					<p>hmm... I don&#039;t own a wndr3800 I own the predecessor wndr3700v1. So I can&#039;t speak about special problems of the wndr3800. But I don&#039;t think there are any. <br />No hardware-crypto for vpn, and no detachable antennas. That&#039;s it.</p>									</div>

					<p>they are all using the same switch, and it&#039;s definitily working on the wndr3700v1. I wouldn&#039;t give much about some rumor on the dd-wrt-homepage.<br />I remember that it took some time to get support in openwrt for this switch, but that was 1-2 years ago. Now it&#039;s just working</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 5 Jul 2012, 09:02)</p>
