					<p>Hello developers!</p><p>I&#039;m trying to find a package that contains libstdc++.so.6, but somehow what ever I try to install is missing. Does anyone have any idea where can I download it?<br />Currently I have Carambola2 board with Designated Driver (v2.8, r47802)</p><p>Also when I want to access the board over browser it&#039;s not possible (Not Found The requested URL /cgi-bin/luci was not found on this server.). When the same IP address (192.168.1.1) is pinged is fine and I&#039;m able to connect to it over ssh. </p><p>Can please someone help me? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /><br />I&#039;m writing a master thesis using Carambola2 and should really start &quot;real&quot; work on the board, but constantly some small mistakes are coming up.</p>									</div>
