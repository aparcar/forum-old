					<p>Hi there,</p><p>I have problem with PLUGIN enabling in OpenVPN. My firmware is made using build process with &quot;make menuconfig&quot; where I have included openvpn package and later installed on my router.<br />Now I have working configuration and can login through vpn to my router and network behind it from Windows and Linux workstations. For security, I use certificates/keys I have made.</p><p>In futher, I would like to enable username/password in combination to certs/keys. Now, I have problem because my router does or does not recognize plugin instructions and I need help from someone.</p><p>On router /etc/openvpn/server.conf at bottom I have put:<br />plugin /usr/share/openvpn/plugin/lib/openvpn-auth-pam.so login<br />username-as-common-name</p><p>On Linux workstation /etc/openvpn/client.conf at bottom I have put:<br />auth-user-pass</p><p>When I look at syslog output , my router (openvpn server) do not mind such configuration.... no errors or warnings during boot process....<br />When start client, to connect, it asks me for username and password and <span class="bbu">whatever</span> I put as username/password it goes and two systems connects to each other. When I comment out &quot;auth-user-pass&quot; from client.conf I try to connect to server and again it connects without problems !!!</p><p>Now, I assume that:<br />1) openvpn server is not configured as it should be, OR <br />2) openvpn server, I have build into my firmware, do not work with plugins <br />3) OR....</p><p>Seeing discussion from above, I have tried to search for .../trunk/package/openvpn to edit Makefile and edit it manually but I don&#039;t have that folder in my SVN download folder.</p><p>Can someone help me with this?</p><p>EDIT:<br />plugin /overlay/etc/openvpn/plugin/openvpn-auth-pam.so login</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>liquid.o</strong> on 23 Dec 2010, 13:14)</p>
