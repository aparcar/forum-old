					<p>Hello All, <br />This is my First Post-&gt; Sorry if I posted in a wrong place.</p><br /><p>I&#039;m trying to use the in Kernel DNS resolver module in one of my kernel modules for a project. I can&#039;t seem to find an example or a similar implementation on the NET (I combed the Net for 4 days with no productive results).</p><p>I got the module added to my Openwrt Image through menuconfig (added all dependents). In the man page there is a mention of dns.upcall tool, I can&#039;t seem to find this&nbsp; tool anywhere. I manged to add the cifs.upcall through kernel_menuconfig.</p><p>I can confirm kmod-dnsresolver is listed under installed modules on my OpenWrt.</p><p>I will really appreciate your DETAILED (sample code) help on this please.</p><p>My exact requirement is to do a reverse DNS probe for a given IP in kernel space.</p><p>I&#039;m using a SDK to cross compile my .ko modules and I can cofirm my modules are working fine(I developed a netfilter hook module it is working perfactly OK).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Thanking you ever much,</p>									</div>
