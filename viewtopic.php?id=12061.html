					<p>Hi,</p><p>i&#039;ve made the mistake to flash from OpenWrt WhiteRussian 0.9 to dd-wrt v24 beta.<br />After i have recognized, that the DMZ-function in dd-wrt is a bloody joke, i wanted to flash back to OpenWrt.</p><p>I&#039;ve been trying this for hours but without success ;-(<br />It is not possible to flash the trx-image in the web interface.<br />Moreover can&#039;t I flash the image with tftp, like the first time that I have changed the original firmware with OpenWrt.</p><p>Any hint would be gorgeous :-)<br />Maybe it is possible to flash the image with an command line program.</p><p>Thx in advance</p>									</div>

					<p>There is no bin file for Asus (and most other non-Linksys) Broadcom routers; they use the trx file.<br />phil202: dd-wrt should not effect TFTP flashing at all; unless it turned boot_wait off...&nbsp; No clue in regards to flashing via the dd-wrt web interface, don&#039;t use dd-wrt.&nbsp; I&#039;d try their forums...</p>									</div>
