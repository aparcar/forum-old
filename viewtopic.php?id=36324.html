					<p>If you go browsing forums that I frequent you&#039;ll see that every so often this happens to me.&nbsp; I make a post requesting assistance after bashing my head on it for several hours.&nbsp; 5 minutes after making said posting I find the rather lame issue and resolve it.</p><p>In this case the MAC filter I thought had been applied successfully apparently wasn&#039;t.&nbsp; Is there any way to get an AP to log failed wifi associations blocked by the MAC filter?</p>									</div>
