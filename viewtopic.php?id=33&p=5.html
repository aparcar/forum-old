					<p>Hi,<br />I have a few questions about tje WGT634U.<br />- Did anybody noticed that there was a Gearguy account in the shadow and passwd files? I have not check wether or not this account can log in but I find it &quot;disturbing&quot;. This account gets a &quot;special&quot; bering menu when logging in through telnet with a few more options.<br />- Do you know if it&#039;s possible withtout the CFE access to make the router first ask for a kernel image through tftp or if I have to use a serial console in order to do this?<br />- Do I need to be connected on the WAN port in order to do the tftp boot or can I be connected to another port?</p><p>Thank you<br />JEff</p>									</div>

					<p>hi jeff,<br />- Have not checked for that user since i do not run the netgear image anymore.<br />- The only way to access the CFE is with a serial-console, but you should be able to modify the settings for the STARTUP specified before in this thread by accessing the device where the parameters are stored. (have not done this since i already have a serial-console)<br />- Correct, the only port that you can use to download a kernel with is the WAN port.</p>									</div>

					<p>So I was messing around trying to set up the router as a small web server using the USB drive as the page source.&nbsp; I&#039;ve configured shorewall to allow the ports, and can run a second instance of boa with a new config file and have been able to display a small test page - problem is, it still asks for my router username/password as if I&#039;m logging in to the configuration utility.&nbsp; Anyone know where that setting is??&nbsp; I looked through the boa source code a bit and see it generating the authorization failed message, but I didn&#039;t immediately see anything to indicate boa was doing this on its own.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,<br />I&#039;ve sucessfully gained telnet access to the router with the ftp hack and the /tmp/telnetenable file. Then I&#039;ve made some changes to the /etc/samba/smb.conf file (for some more user-friendly share names)&nbsp; and this is made persistent because smb.conf is entered in the /config/config.list file.</p><p>Next things I want to do is to enable WDS on the router. This should be possible via some iwconfig and iwpriv commands. Has anyone already made some experience with changing the wireless config besides the built in web interface? What iwconfig, iwpriv commands would be necessary to turn on WDS (set the router in repeater mode and tell it the MAC address of the other access point, e.g. iwconfig mode Repeater and iwconfig ap MAC)? What is kept in the /etc/wireless.conf file? Is WDS supported by the driver? What about changing the transmission power via iwconfig txpower?</p><p>Another interesting thing woult be to have a print server running on the device (for USB printer). The samba server could be configured for that (via smb.conf [printer]). But what about a printer spooler deamon (form the /etc/services files it looks like it is)? Is a USB printer class device supported by the usb configuration (seems to be some printer stuff in the /etc/hotplug/usb/* files)?</p><p>After all a discussion would be nice on how to change settings with the netgear firmware and how to make this persistent. This is for those, who do not have the time to build their own firmware but want to use the router as a router and improve a couple of things from the netgear build.</p><p>:-) Tom</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />does anybody have a kernel that I could flash on the wgt634u to start with? (Gnubbel, if you have this, I would really like to try it)<br />I would like to have a point to start with even if I must have a tftpd on the wan port. <br />Or maybe somebody knows how to change a netgear firmware so that it includes the right STARTUP value? </p><p>I don&#039;t have the telnet access anymore with the 1.4.10. Does anybody have the same problem?

					<p>Has anyone actually tried to boot openwrt on a WGT634U? Is there any reason why it wouldn&#039;t boot? What kind of image should be used to flash it? trx? or should it just be a raw squashfs/jffs2 image?</p>									</div>
