					<p>brcm-2.4 is the legacy target for Linux 2.4 on these routers.</p><p>For example: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt54g">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt54g</a></p><p>As you can see, the brcm-2.4 versions are arguably more stable on some rather old routers. If you want to keep only current release information then you can drop it as it is not available with current kernels.</p><p>That gets me to another thing I thought about. The table lists from which version on the device was supported. It doesn&#039;t list until what version it is supported. Now I&#039;m not an expert in this regard, but I don&#039;t think support for devices was ever really dropped, it&#039;s just some legacy devices don&#039;t work very well with newer releases that need more flash and RAM. The venerable WRT54G for example wouldn&#039;t really work well with the stock build of BB, but a custom build with some stuff removed and zram or maybe even extroot via sdcard/usb (possible via modding) can make it work on recent software.</p>									</div>

					<p>A very good point. The &quot;supported in&quot; info is frequently misunderstood. The r(elease) number is valuable information, but not everyone is familiar with release numbers or how they relate to trunk/release versions. To the point where some people deliberately install an older version of OpenWrt on their device, thinking it is the <em>last</em> version that supports it. It is especially confusing to have an obviously outdated &quot;trunk&quot; link in there for models that had proper releases with 12.09 and 14.07.</p>									</div>

					<p>drawz and I had a conversation regarding ways to attract new people about a month back. zo0ok is doing great work to cast a discerning eye on specific parts of the wiki. That&#039;s important, but relatively few people have the the time, knowledge, or energy to make far-reaching changes like this.</p><p>It would be cool to harness the energy of individuals in the community. We all know something about a few topics. And if we worked with the focus of &quot;making OpenWrt more friendly to beginners&quot;, we could accomplish a lot.</p><p>Here are a couple things that haven&#039;t been mentioned already:</p><p>- Give people who care about their routers an incentive (or at least, permission) to edit their own router&#039;s TOH page to give the latest info. I will note that the TP-Link TL-WDR7500 page (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr7500">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr7500</a>) provides a good template, with pictures, supported version info, and a Quick Start guide. The remaining info is useful detail for the advanced user, but it&#039;s at the bottom so it doesn&#039;t get in the way of newbies.</p><p>- Create a new sticky topic named &quot;Barrier Breaker Compatible&quot; that tells about the stable version, how to install it, how to install the web GUI (Luci), and to load a few important packages. People can then add replies about router(s) where they have personally installed BB, with links to that router&#039;s TOH page. </p><p>- Is there a poll feature in the Forum software? If so, perhaps that could be wired up to let people vote for a router that has already been entered into the Barrier Breaker topic without making formal &quot;endorsement&quot; of any gear.</p><p>- Create a new &quot;Welcome to OpenWrt&quot; page on the site. It could talk about OpenWrt, router firmware in general, getting started info, links to the Barrier Breaker Compatible topic, etc.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>richbhanover</strong> on 10 Apr 2015, 06:11)</p>

The problem is it&#039;s not possible to run WiFi on this device with a stock BB while keeping all the other functionality due too RAM scarcity. WiFi probably works fine when configured as a DumbAP (i.e. no NAT, hence no firewall, no DNS/DHCP, no LuCI). Word on the forum has it this is fixed using a custom build with zram, so it could be that this old legacy router works better with CC than BB.</p><p>In that regard I wonder whether developers consider enabling zram by default on 16MB RAM routers in CC and what the caveats are. Technically zram increases CPU load and the CPU of these old routers aren&#039;t that strong so there may be other performance implications.</p><p>Such a poll or survey is actually a great idea.</p>									</div>

					<p>SCF, yes...</p><p>So the question is what discrete options for &quot;WiFi functionality&quot; should be added to the poll.

					<p>Guys, I do Content Management for a living. Trust me when I say: You want to have <em>as much information as possible, in as much detail as possible</em>. You don&#039;t want to be stuck on naming conventions you set now which may be insufficient in the future, in the best case you will want to only do this <em>once</em>.</p><p>Which means: Gather as much diversified information for an entry as possible, even if you don&#039;t need it (yet). Insert number of antennas, chipsets, USB ports and speeds, heck, maybe even physical size of the case and other things that for now seem irrelevant. It is dead easy to <em>omit</em> information for the time being or reword it when needed than having to go through the whole list again later.</p><p>A smart way to do this would would be to come up with some sort of convention that allows any number of details to be kept with the article in a format that can be easily crawled and compiled. At the moment, the hardware tables in the articles differ wildly, and they are mostly just unstructured pseudo-HTML.</p><p>I&#039;m not very familiar with the particular brand of Wiki openwrt.org uses, but maybe it&#039;s possible to introduce some sort of standardized template as in MediaWiki?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 11 Apr 2015, 16:56)</p>

					<p>The problem isn&#039;t collecting the information as any detail information we want to omit in the main table should still be on the detail pages of the respective device. This discussion is more about what info to include in the main table and how to represent it (at least that&#039;s how I understood it). For the poll we need to hit a middle ground, cause I doubt such a poll can always give you the complete range of info. Some people are not proficient with all the details so the quality of information you gather also depends on how skilled the users are to assess certain aspects.</p><p>Many routers have such info like physical dimension in a table on the detail page for example. And yes I agree these should be standardized across the wiki so the richness of information is about the same for all devices.</p><p>Poke me with a stick if you think I&#039;m not on the same page ;-)</p>									</div>

					<p>metai has a point...</p><p>My suggestion... standardizing, applying conventions, and compacting (802.11n does not provide more information than 11n or even n) is good and valuable under all circumstances. If we remove information from the ToH (like TX power) we can, for now, add it to the hardware article itself.</p><p>It is probably better that we have slightly complicated and perhaps imperfect/inconsistent format, rather than adding columns that will most of the time be empty.</p><p>However, perhaps it would be good to add one &quot;Misc&quot; or &quot;Extra&quot; column where relevant information can go, and where it does not pollute the columns that we want to keep clean. Like the &quot;Flash MB&quot; column... perhaps we should never have information about SD-cards there. And when we have SD-cards we can add it to the Extra-column. That way we can keep most columns very clean and standardized, and have one more free column. As it is now sometimes the &quot;Version&quot; or the &quot;Status&quot; columns are used for completely arbitrary things, just because they are there and available (unless I cleaned all the cases, but I doubt it).</p><p>About the wiki capabilities and the templates... I also think we may come to a point where we want to use the current Wiki smarter or use another tool to maintain the ToH-information. But cleaning up the information is a great start nevertheless. Migrating low quality data into brand new systems... it is not what I do for a living, but I see it all the time.</p><p>metai - good? or is the editing/cleaning that tmo26, I (and others) have started doing going to fast?</p>									</div>

But from the viewpoint of data keeping, the detail pages are a mess right now. There should really be a standardized way of including details on the pages. To illustrate my point, compare the features table on two random hardware detail pages. (For example: Compare the page for the TP-Link MR3020 to that of the WR703N. The latter doesn&#039;t even <em>have</em> a features table, all its characteristics are kept in plaintext.)</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>This discussion is more about what info to include in the main table and how to represent it</p></blockquote></div><p>Once you have an agreed upon format to keep <em>all</em> data on the device pages, it is downright trivial to parse them and regenerate the table, making adjustments to columns and wording of the table on the fly.</p><p>We are on the same page here, no worries. I just think that the real effort to clean the Wiki should go into the detail pages, not into the overview table.</p><p>Edit, addendum: I am perfectly aware of how much of a herculean task it is to clean up all the single detail pages, even if it&#039;s just to add/standardize the device data.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 11 Apr 2015, 19:19)</p>
