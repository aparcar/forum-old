					<p>Hello</p><p>I have&nbsp; 5 Linksys´equip. thats have Problem !</p><p>1 WRV54GS and 4 WET11 !</p><p>The problem is Boot ( Firmware) - I think !</p><p>Linksys Wrv54g -&nbsp; &nbsp;When I Turn on - Power Led Brink !&nbsp; The DMZ, WIFI and Internet is off.&nbsp; The LAN1-4 Led is on when I plug on Network Card, but the AP doesn´t send IP by DHCP and doesn´t work manually (setup).<br />I think the firmware whas corrupted or Blank.&nbsp; I try to connect by Serial port on PCB Header, but only see garbage on HyperTerminal.&nbsp; &nbsp;I Have a JTag Cable that I made for WRT54G. This cable is compatible with WRV54G ( analysing the Pinout on Both equip.) ?&nbsp; &nbsp;What soft runs on WINXP ( or w98) to fix the firmware by jtag cable on wrv54g ?</p><br /><p>WET11 - The 4 equip have the same problem. Only Power Led is turn on .&nbsp; The Diag, Lan, Wlan Led is off.&nbsp; The LAN connect is not possible ( PC show that LAN is disconnect ! ).&nbsp; I try the X-II Switch, but doesn´t work !</p><p>Its possible to use the same cable on WET11 ?&nbsp; And the soft, to fix the firmware by WinXP ( or W98) !</p><br /><p>I not use Linux on my Pc - because this, i I need a solution for Windows(98-XP) or MSDOS </p><br /><p> Thanks</p><p>Cleber - from Brasil</p>									</div>

					<p>For both You need a whole different cable, and it wouldn&#039;t be easy even with Linux. Search for &quot;ARM JTAG&quot;.</p>									</div>

					<p>If that cable is standard ARM JTAG (dunno, never had any ARM stuff) it should work.. But You need a different program for sure.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok... Thanks !</p><p>I think to use the program, and replace the WRT Firm to WRV firm and recover the WRT.<br />To WET11, I need to install Linux or use a SIGWIN ( linux for win). </p><p>By the way... I have another problem to resolve - A Zyxel Prestige 645R ADSL ROUTER , thats have a problem with firmware - Rebooting Looping !&nbsp; &nbsp;The lan connect is dead !&nbsp; &nbsp;Telnet/FTP/WEB doesn´t work.&nbsp; Its the secound equip. thats show this problem.&nbsp; Only soluction that&nbsp; I know is remove the TSOP firm chip, put into a EPROM PROGRAMER to record the firm and reinstall on PCB, but is difficult to make this with TSOP EPROM.&nbsp; I not have the TSOP adapter and i send it to a Electronic Service. <br />I try to fix it by serial connection - use a TTL Interface - 74HC14N&nbsp; /&nbsp; MAX232 , but its show Garbage on Hyperterminal. <br />Using the same interface&nbsp; with&nbsp; Prestige 645 thats function well - its show all test and the debug mode !</p><p>I need another method to fix it - like a ARM JTAG , because the CPU is ARM (SANSUNG S3C4510x01)</p>									</div>
