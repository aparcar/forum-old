					<p>I have installed the necesary openwrt SDK packages. I executed &quot;make menuconfig&quot; and selected some additional packages, i.e. asterisk. Then, &quot;make&quot; will completely compile and build the whole openwrt + all the selected packages. This is fine; however, I need to find out how do I selectively compile (and/or clean) only selected packages, i.e. asterisk. I tried &quot;make asterisk&quot; and make returned with an error saying <em>make: *** No rule to make target `asterisk&#039;.&nbsp; Stop</em>, let alone &quot;make asterisk clean&quot;.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mazilo</strong> on 13 Aug 2006, 00:54)</p>
