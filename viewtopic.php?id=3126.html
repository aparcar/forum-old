					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have Linksys wrt54g. I used it with standard firmware (2.02.7) and it<br />worked ok. Just for fun, I installed whiterussian RC3. I flashed it with<br />tftp.</p><p>I have a &quot;standard&quot; configuration:<br />- wan with dhcp<br />- lan with 192.168.1.0/24 and dhcp from 100 to 150<br />- dnsmasq<br />- no telnet, access only with ssh<br />- AP infrastructure mode<br />- WEP</p><p>Actually everythink works find, except for system crashes which occur<br />very often, particularly when I am logged in with ssh. I have the<br />maximum of uptime of aprox. 30 minutes. I have an impression, that if<br />I am not logged in, the system works fine (but still it has to be<br />tested better). Any hints?</p><p>After last crash, I can not log in (ssh says &#039;Permission denied&#039;). Obviously<br />at least either sshd or /etc/passwd is currupted. Is there any other way<br />to log into the system? Must I reflash the device? How about this crashes?</p><p>Thank you,<br />Marek.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for the hint.</p><p>Unfortunatelly it has not helped.</p><p>I reflashed the device and I executed linksys-fixup.sh. But I think for my hardware version the script does nothing. It symply displays line with HW type:</p><p>nvram get boardtype gives 0x101.</p><p>I don&#039;t have system crashes (well I use telnet instead of ssh right now), but on &quot;heavy&quot; load, what in my case means (I use my wrt54g at home, so I have just a few connections from browser and mp3 stream, + a few telnet sessions) less than 1, the system is not stable, eg. ls command give segmentation fault, ps command displays processes and hangs.</p><p>I reflashed the device with tftp. Well, to my suprice, changes which I had done in eg. /etc were not lost afterwards. </p><p>Thank you,<br />Marek.</p>									</div>
