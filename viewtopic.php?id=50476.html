					<p>Hi there,</p><p>Just reverted my own wr1043nd to stock firmware. A quick question, after this revert, when I try to upgrade to a newer stock firmware, do I need to strip the bootloader part from the new image, or is it working as is?</p><p>So basically, do we need to strip the bootloader from all images from here onwards?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
