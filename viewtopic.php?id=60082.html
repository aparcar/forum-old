If the former maybe the cisco does the prioritization and second router just preserves it.</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>

					<p>So I have a Netgear WNDR4300 running OpenWRT, this router IS my WAN and VLAN1 (normal house) access Point, DHCP server, access router.</p><p>The Cisco 2851 is my CUCME (Cisco Voice) router, it also routes a few other internal (My Lab area, House Phone VLan, and my OOB or ILO network access VLan). The are other Csico and Procurve Layer 2 access switchers in these VLans. </p><p>They are all connected by 1Gb UTP (ie Copper) links. </p><p>So when I get off my shift, I will plan to use a few PC to flood the up link, not just one PC. And then try to make 2 out bound calls to &#039;really&#039; see if the OpenWRT rtr is prioritizing my RTP packets.</p><p>I know the Cisco (7961 and 7970 &#039;skinny&#039; phones) will set there RTP packets with DSCP ER headers, the Cisco router will forward them out is priority que.
