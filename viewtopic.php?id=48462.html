					<p>no, i did not expect users to expect me to be using openwrt. im just trying to find out how to do this with the use of optware and lighttpd. commands are welcome as well. and there is only a &quot;beta&quot; version of openwrt for the e3000. was pretty frustrating every time i had to move the router back from openwrt to dd-wrt. bricked every time.</p>									</div>
