					<p>Hi! I bought a WRT160NL one week ago and was interested in installing OpenWRT on it so I had a few questions:</p><p>After installing OpenWRT can I upgrade the OpenWRT build using the web upgrade or could there be problems (this may sound like a dumb question but I read there were some problems with the old wrt160n)?</p><p>In the unlikely case I make openwrt unbootable can I still recover using the boot TFTP restore or will I be forced to install a serial port or reflash using a JTAG interface?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello vertix, yes you should be able to upgrade using the the web interface<br />though I&#039;m not sure if there&#039;s a snapshot build for wrt160nl with working wifi yet. <br />If not you would need to build your own from source.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kyri</strong> on 3 Sep 2009, 04:00)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the answer. I&#039;m building the image right now, hoping nothing goes wrong. If it works fine I&#039;ll build a clean one with only wi-fi and usb(+mass-storage) enabled and upload it somewhere in case someone else needs it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vertix</strong> on 3 Sep 2009, 05:14)</p>

					<p>I read somewhere else on the forum can&#039;t remember the exact wording now but the general principle is that if you don&#039;t know how to compile your own images (or at least be able to figure out how to it by reading the relevant openwrt docs ans/or forum threads) then you shouldn&#039;t be using such images. <br />I.e. wait for an official release, or use a snapshot.<br />That&#039;s why you won&#039;t find many user-built images floating around in the forum (though I did notice a couple).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kyri</strong> on 3 Sep 2009, 13:06)</p>
