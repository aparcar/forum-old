					<p>Hi , i need couple advise &amp; solution from you guys .</p><p>1. if the wireless access point that my zsun (wifi card reader turned OpenWRT magic) was connected , isn&#039;t around on the boot , zsun crashes and I&#039;m left with only option of resetting and all my data (openvpn luci , bridge configurations) will go banana ! so IMHO , i think either i need a bash script in boot to remove all previously connected access points or I&#039;m missing something ! your solution ?</p><p>2. I&#039;m having constant problems with DNS drop of my WiFi modem , incidentally leads to not being able to update or even receive data on my zsun ! i played a bit with dnsmasq and tried some editing of /etc/resolv.conf on each boot but no luck (probably lack of experience) ! most of the times i can&#039;t even update my packets...&nbsp; any advice will be appreciated !</p>									</div>

					<p>There are numerous solutions to the generic issue of unable to access the AP when the STAtion goes missing.</p><p>It&#039;s probably worth understanding exactly how you use the ZSun.&nbsp; Specifically are you connecting to a specific set of STAtions or are you a road warrior and rarely use the same STAtion twice.&nbsp; </p><p>If you are always connecting to different stations, then it may pay to run a job at startup that just removes what ever station is there.</p><p>If you are connecting to a specific set of stations then you may want to look at dirks travelmate.<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=67697">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=67697</a></p>									</div>
