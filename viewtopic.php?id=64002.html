					<p>There is a new TP-Link WR740N V6 now available. Just bought one today and it says V6 on the label. It has a new longer Antenna on the outside. Still uses 5 V DC adapter. Internally it uses a new Chip QCA-9533-BL3A. The memory chip is Zentel A3S56D40GTP - 50L. I guess it is 4 MB since the original firmware image is 3.8 MB in size. </p><p>Any chance on this getting supported with Openwrt. Please tell me what more information can I provide for the developers to make this happen. Will be glad to help.</p>									</div>

					<p>That&#039;s good to hear. I have whipped up a 15.05.1 image which you can find <a href="https://volatilesystems.org/dl/openwrt/targets/tl-wr740n-v6/">here</a>. If my domain does not resolve, try with e.g. Google DNS or OpenDNS servers.</p><p>If my assumptions are right this image should boot on your device. If the WAN LED you&#039;re talking about does not function, however, you need to &#039;poke at the GPIOs&#039; like I was told in #openwrt to find out what GPIO handles the new LED, which we can then add to the OpenWrt code. I haven&#039;t done that myself yet (I just tested a bit though) - you can find info on hat <a href="http://elinux.org/GPIO">here</a>.</p><p>You first need to export the GPIOs, this e.g. will try to do this for GPIOs 0 through 30. Judging from the code for the TL-WR740N, that should be enough to start with:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>for I in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30; do echo $I ; echo $I &gt; /sys/class/gpio/export ; done</code></pre></div><p>This should give you new files in /sys/class/gpio, like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# ls /sys/class/gpio/
export     gpio10     gpio12     gpio13     gpio14     gpio15     gpio9      gpiochip0  unexport</code></pre></div><p>Maybe someone else can help out on how to proceed further, to probe those. I guess you&#039;d need to try the other commands from the Elinux page and watch how the LEDs (or the device) reacts to it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Borromini</strong> on 13 Apr 2016, 01:02)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the image. I tried the factory image just now, unfortunately it bricked the router. I was nevertheless able to restore the original firmware successfully and it got unbricked. </p><p>Post the flash the router reboots and then I have the power LED and the LAN Port LED number 1, 2 and 3 light up and stay solid. The WAN or the System LED (Lock Icon) do not turn on at all. I tried it twice and both times it resulted in the same result. Wireshark shows no packets either on the WAN or LAN ports, just totally silent.</p><p>However the good news is that restoring it to original firmware is a breeze so there is no risk of bricking. Would appreciate if you can help me debug this issue. Hopefully we should have a working ROM for this model soon <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not sure how to proceed at this point.

					<p>Borromini, can you help me to modify the header for the TP-Link 841N v10 image. That model has the exact same SoC chip , RAM and Flash. I was discussing this on the openwrt irc channel and someone suggested that if the hardware is identical then I should try flashing the image for WR841N V10. Can you help me modify the header for that image so that it can be flashed on WR740N V6. </p><p>Here is the link for the 841N V10 image.... <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05.1/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-15.05.1-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr841n-v10-squashfs-factory.bin">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal … actory.bin</a></p><p>Thanks a lot for all your help.</p>									</div>

					<p>Okay I got it working !! </p><p>Here is what I did to make it work. </p><p>Take the TL-WR841N Version 10 Openwrt factory image. Edit the header to reflect 740N V6 and change the checksum to the new value. Then flash through TFTP. The 740N V6 router downlaods the image, reboots and works perfectly. I can access Luci. Wifi is working so are the LED&#039;s and the LAN ports. </p><p>This hopefully confirms that the TL-WR740N V6 has the same hardware as the 841N V10. I will request the Dev team to please add support for the TL-WR740N V6 in the proper fashion since it already is present in the 841N V10 tree.</p>									</div>

Flashed it through Stock Firmware Upgrade option on the TP-Link WR740N V6 and it successfully flashed and booted back into OpenWRT. All functions seem to be working fine too.

					<p>That&#039;s great to hear. A final check: can you tell me which SVN revision is reported on the LuCI login page? Should be 49118.

You can be sure that it was the image you sent cause my images have a preset password and are customized. Whereas yours was the default Access Point and had no password. </p><p>I have already sent the routers I had for installation so we will have to wait till I get another v6.
