					<p>I agree with nearly everything that everyone has said. In the interest of coming to closure, I want to list my only open issues:</p><p>1) Handling &quot;trunk&quot; releases: I still don&#039;t understand how we want people to set the fields of a dataentry to indicate that a router is supported by the stable (say, BB) release, but that there&#039;s also a trunk (CC) image that seems to be working. (We have handled the case of a brand new router that has never had a stable release already.) </p><p>2) I am concerned that we could get a brittle system following the responses to thread messages #953 &amp; $954 (re: comment on the ToH page and Techdata comment). These solutions will work fine if people read the documentation and understand it fully before proceeding. But to help people who don&#039;t read carefully, and/or make a mistake, I like to leave hints in place. Specifically:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - For #953: Yes, the major new ToH pages should be locked... But if someone tries to edit a ToH page the way they&#039;ve &quot;always done it&quot;, they will see the comment telling them the new way to add/update info. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - For #954: If someone *does* use the right-hand Edit, we could use the same kind of block comment to say, &quot;Use the bottom edit button&quot;</p><p>3) I regret mentioning the empty URLs. I think the empty string looks much better than the peculiar and non-working http://¿ URL.</p><p>4) I think we need to include explicit instructions for contacting the wiki admin. *I* don&#039;t know how to do it (unless it&#039;s contacting tmo26) - all my previous e-mail efforts have led to naught.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>richbhanover</strong> on 20 Aug 2015, 06:55)</p>

So it does not make sense to require a valid version to be added to the filename. In the future, new revisions can come out: B, C, D. These may or may not be &quot;practically identical&quot; to my first version (A). Unless we can&#039;t look into the future we can&#039;t make good choices about naming files based on versions.</p><p>Academically, three solutions could be better:<br /> 1) use a GUID filename instead (I hate this)<br /> 2) always require version before adding a device, and create multiple entries when there is a new version, even if they are practically identical (this sucks a lot in the real world for us)<br /> 3) Never use version in the filename, always use _1, _2, _3 instead. But this just makes things less clear and more consistent.</p><p>I can easily allow 1.00 or 1.0 in the filename (rather than 100 or 10). Fine.<br />But you can still not look at the filename and draw any useful or general conclusions about the device version.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have been implementing large business systems for over 25 years.&nbsp; I know from experience that the technical solution (the ToH itself) is only a small part of the &quot;system&quot;.&nbsp; Gaining user acceptance, which typically includes testing, training and supporting documentation is a major part of a successful implementation.</p><p>We have offered testing, and they did not come.<br />Training is not easy with out a captive audience.&nbsp; The best someone could do are some YouTube videos.<br />Documentation on the other hand is something that can be done.&nbsp; </p><p>It is NOT reasonable to expect users to look for or find the pages of information that exist; they need to be directed.&nbsp; The site search tools, in general, are poor.&nbsp; The pages are not well linked and the pages that do exist are in need of review for current content and organization.&nbsp; </p><p>It&#039;s a relatively small effort to go the extra mile and create fresh and succinct documentation for the actual product.&nbsp; This includes content both separate from and on the actual product pages.</p><p>I have taken a stab at a ToH Start PAGE, which I think should replace the existing ToH entry page <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start.">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start.</a>.

For anyone<br /> a) waiting for the device to be supported<br /> b) wanting to work on device support<br />the forum topic, Unsupported field, and Comment field should be better. Historically, many devices remain WIP/Possible for long, while other devices are completely undocumented even when they are supported (Netgear R7000).
