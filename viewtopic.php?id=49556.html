					<p>Hello, earlier today I successfully updated a TP-LINK TL-WR710N from its stock firmware to OpenWrt (<a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr710n-v1-squashfs-factory.bin">openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr710n-v1-squashfs-factory.bin</a>). Unfortunately I made a mistake when configuring the network settings so the device was unreachable afterwards. So I entered failsafe mode, mounted the partition holding &#039;etc&#039; (there is no mount_root script!) and corrected my mistake.</p><p>Well, now the problem is that the device seems to be dead since the reboot. The LED blinks as follows:<br />- Off for ~1,5s<br />- Dimmed on for maybe ~200ms<br />- On for ~1s</p><p>It is not possible to enter failsafe mode any more, the device keeps on blinking forever. Does anybody know what the blink code means? Is there any chance of recovering the device via Ethernet? I successfully opened the case but it seems to be impossible to remove the board in order to reach the UART pins without damaging anything (glue!). In case someone did that, please tell me how.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>Seems like the flash lost its content. After some cutting and glue-removing I actually managed to get the board out of the case without damaging both. With access to the serial interface it was easy to restore OpenWrt. Problem solved.</p>									</div>

					<p>Something similar has just happened to me. I installed OpenWrt and then Luci web interface. When I tried to open the web interface I got an error saying that there were too many redirects. I googled that and found someone else had logged the same issue <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/15358">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/15358</a></p><p>A user there suggested the issue was libubox and so in my router I ran &quot;opkg install libubox&quot; and rebooted the router. Now nothing is responding, I cant get an ip address and even the reset button is not responding. I normally hold in the reset button for 7 or 8 seconds and wait for the blinking lights but no matter how long I hold it in for now it does nothing.</p><p>Is my tl-wr710n a brick or can I recover it via USB flashing or something else?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>brimur</strong> on 9 Apr 2014, 16:11)</p>
