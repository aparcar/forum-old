					<p>I have a Vodafone K5005 (Huawei E398) USB modem, which works fine. I also have a TPLINK MR3420 3G/4G router. Using the latest Huntsman FW, things work OK, but only when the modem is set to use 3G.</p><p>Under Modem &gt; Network Status we have options to Decrease/Increase the Communication Port. When this is set to default (/dev/ttyUSB1), there is no 4G option in the Cellular Mode section. While Playing with the Increase/Decrease buttons, I inadvertently pressed one before the previous press was processed, and I ended up with several &quot;Change Cellular Mode&quot; boxes, which did show 4G.</p><p>Anyway, how do I get my modem/router to work at 4G? Is there a different FW I should be using?</p><p>Thanks for any advice.</p>									</div>

					<p>Turns out that, because my 4G signal is weak, it puts a greater power demand on the modem, which the router is not able to provide. Connecting the modem to the router via a powered USB hub solves the problem, and 4G works properly.</p>									</div>
