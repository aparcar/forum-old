					<p>I tried searching the forums and the wiki (and the web), and couldn&#039;t find anything for this particular use-case.&nbsp; If there is something out there that I missed, do point me towards it.</p><br /><p>I&#039;m trying to use OpenVPN to run a personal server from my apartment (without a public IP).&nbsp; Basically, what I&#039;m trying to do is this...</p><p>Personal Server --&gt; OpenWRT router/OpenVPN client --&gt; OpenVPN server --&gt; Internet</p><p>...so that from the outside world, I can connect to the VPN server&#039;s IP, and it will route the request to my personal server.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got the VPN client set up, and it works - I can ping the VPN server from the router, and I can reach the internet through the VPN from the router.&nbsp; Machines on my LAN, however, can&#039;t reach anything outside when the VPN is running.&nbsp; I&#039;m relatively new to configuring firewalls and just can&#039;t get it right.</p><p>Ultimately, I&#039;d like incoming requests from the VPN server to go back out through the VPN, but any traffic originating from my LAN to go directly to the internet (not over the VPN).&nbsp; How can I set up my firewall rules to do this?</p><p>Running on OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05</p>									</div>

					<p>That&#039;s a good point, I could certainly do that.</p><p>I&#039;m going to have probably 2 server machines that I&#039;m running (each providing different services), and the VPN server is run by a 3rd party, so I do need to put in a support ticket for every port I need forwarded ... but that&#039;s going to be true whether my VPN client is the router or the machine on the LAN.&nbsp; So in that regard, it makes no difference which box the client is on.</p><p>I also need to be able to access my servers&#039; services both from inside my LAN and from the world; will I still be able to do that if the VPN client is running on my personal server?&nbsp; It seems to me like I&#039;d just be moving my firewall problem from the router to the server machine -- I still would need to configure it to respond via the same interface the request came from (eth0 or tun0), right?</p>									</div>

					<p>Reading comments from others that tried to run servers behind VPNs, there seems to be a big routing issue with that kind of schema: when your server receives a request, it tries to answer using the &quot;default&quot; route, not the route where the request came from; thus the other end receives a request from a different IP address, and the connection is never established.</p><p>I know how configure routes based on the destination IP addres, but I have not idea how to configure the routing table to take into account the IP address of the original request. However, when your Personal Server answer a request from some computer inside the local network, it will answer using the local interface (and not the VPN interface), because it knows that all computers with a local IP address must be reached using the local interface.</p>									</div>

					<p>Okay, it sounds like my original plan is far beyond my abilities to set up (assuming it can be done).&nbsp; I&#039;ll try setting up the VPN client on my local server -- which should be much easier to configure, from what you&#039;ve said -- and see if that goes any better.&nbsp; I&#039;ll post back here with what I find out (it may be a day before I can really work on it).</p><p>Thank you for all your help and responsiveness so far. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
