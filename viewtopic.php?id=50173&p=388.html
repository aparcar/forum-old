It should come online after that.</p></blockquote></div><p>Strange behavior.....&nbsp; I waited 5 minutes for it to come up. It appeared to be listening, but the wifi analyzer said nothing was being broadcasted. Walked over to the iphone, and it sees 5Ghz, but on another channel. I had originally set it for channel 120, but it actually started broadcasting on 36.</p><p>Was this because it found other signals, and went to 36? Wouldn&#039;t think so since I&#039;m probably 15 or more miles for a airport. </p><p>Initially the Android couldn&#039;t see the broadcasts, but the iphone could. So, I tried channel 100, and after about 60 seconds it came up on channel 100. Both Android and iphones could join no problem.</p><p>So, I don&#039;t know why it is working now when it wasn&#039;t the last 2 times I tried. It might be a little buggy still?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davidc502</strong> on 24 Jan 2016, 00:17)</p>

					<p>The wrong signal is a known issue. according to standards the wireless channel should be changed if it sees radar. The problem with the current driver is that it (eventually) *always* sees radar and then usually switches to channel 36 (lowest non DFS channel).</p><p>So what you see is all known and (im)proper behavior.<br />(tracked here: <a href="https://github.com/kaloz/mwlwifi/issues/57">https://github.com/kaloz/mwlwifi/issues/57</a>)</p><p><span style="color: lightgrey">I&#039;ve currently build my own rather blunt work-around, which keeps the channel where i want it to be.</span></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>JohnnySL</strong> on 24 Jan 2016, 01:09)</p>

					<p>Hey everyone, quick question..&nbsp; Can I still build / patch version .13 of the mwlwifi driver to work with the latest trunk snapshots?&nbsp; I &quot;thought&quot; read some pages back that .13 is fubar&#039;d.&nbsp; I&#039;m asking because I&#039;m seeing degraded performance with the .16 driver, so needless to say, .13 still seems to give the best results.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Mike</p>									</div>

					<p>Just a observations about the latest trunk snapshot -- I&#039;m wondering if beamforming is working correctly. Last night I had 5 devices downstairs, and 1 upstairs, all on 5Ghz. Downstairs all 5 devices were getting degraded service, but upstairs speeds were great (router is downstairs). Tested downstairs, and was getting 20mbps, and walked upstairs near the other device, and had no problems pulling in 100mbps. </p><p>Has anyone run across this type of problem before?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davidc502</strong> on 24 Jan 2016, 16:42)</p>
