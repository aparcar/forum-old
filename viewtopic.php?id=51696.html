					<p>Hey there,</p><p>I have seen some people playing around with this wireless adapter from virgin media WNDA3200. I want to also install OpenWRT firmware to be able to control antenna selection since it has 2 internal antennas. Can anyone give some suggestions or lead me to some links so I can read to see how it can be achieved?</p><p>It is not listed as a supported device however I have seen posts where people wrote they had some problems with the device while running with OpenWRT, but they didn&#039;t mention how they got to Install OpenWRT.</p><p>Since what I require for the adapter to do is a basic switching task, I think I should be able to handle that relatively easy.</p><p>Best Regards,</p><p>Murat</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve used this adapter and it works perfectly with Openwrt. No idea about antenna selection though, I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s even possible - why would want to anyway?</p><p>That ticket is only relevant to Broadcom platform devices.

					<p>Thank you for your reply.</p><p>Can you inform me about what version of OpenWRT you installed on the device.

					<p>You don&#039;t install anything on the device. It&#039;s a USB wireless adapter. You install Openwrt on a router and then plug the device in to it.</p><p>If you want reliable antenna switching you might want to stick to a standard Atheros or older Broadcom router. The drivers for USB Atheros devices are quite limited in comparison.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>qasdfdsaq</strong> on 18 Jul 2014, 17:41)</p>

					<p>Thanks again for the answer. </p><p>I also thought openwrt is for routers, but for some reasons, I believed the wireless adapter can also be flashed with openwrt so that some hardware control(antenna selection) is possible with new firmware. However using the wireless adapter through a router is really costly for us so maybe in the end moving on to an external remote antenna switch is an easier answer with same cost. Since what I want to achieve is to be able to switch from one antenna to another (by disabling antenna diversity on a 11n radio if I want to do it through firmware). Sorry for bothering the forum with a really specific problem.</p>									</div>

					<p>Openwrt is an operating system. While technically the WNDA3200 does have an operating system of sorts, it&#039;s hardware capabilities prevent it from running a <em>general purpose</em> operating system (e.g. Linux/Openwrt), it can only connect to another device and cannot run independently.</p><p>Nonetheless I&#039;m still not sure why you&#039;d want to. You&#039;d have to connect the adapter to <em>something</em> and the cheapest thing you could connect it to is a router - anything else would be even more expensive. </p><p>An external wireless switch would imply you already have another wireless radio to connect the switch to - and chances are that already has an <em>internal</em> switch so why the need for a USB adapter?</p>									</div>

I don&#039;t want to employ laptop all the time I just want to monitor it with the laptop, and once it is automated never use the laptop again. I think there should be some cheaper or smaller solutions tailored just for antenna switching. Router is an overshoot in my opinion. I have seen some external remote antenna switches but they are also too expensive.</p><p>I think my best shot is to choose a wireless adapter that employ diversity which measures both antennas continually and switches to the one with better signal strength.</p>									</div>
