					<p>Hi,</p><p>First time OpenWrt user here. I&#039;m very happy with Attitude Adjustment (12.09, r36088) on my TL-WR1043ND.</p><p>I installed the <strong>wifitoggle</strong> package through the GUI. All is well with the core functionality. I press the button, the radio toggles on or off. And the WLAN LED toggled on and off correspondingly, in the beginning. It has stopped doing that now. It is always on.</p><p>Here is my <em>/etc/config/wifitoggle</em>.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifitoggle
        option button   &#039;wps&#039;

        option persistent       &#039;1&#039;
        option timer            &#039;0&#039;

        option led_sysfs                &#039;tp-link:green:wlan&#039;
        option led_enable_trigger       &#039;none&#039;
        option led_enable_delayon       &#039;500&#039;
        option led_enable_delayoff      &#039;500&#039;
        option led_disable_default      &#039;1&#039;</code></pre></div><p>I am a little wary of the item for which I gave a &#039;none&#039; value. I can&#039;t find any documentation for what it does. These are supposed to be its possible values:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># cat /sys/class/leds/tp-link\:green\:wlan/trigger
[none] switch0 default-on timer phy0rx phy0tx phy0assoc phy0radio phy0tpt netdev usbdev</code></pre></div><p>The documentation says it&#039;s actually the <em>led_disable_default</em> value that determines whether disabling wifi turns off the LED. In any case, I did not change my config file between the last time I saw the LED work and the first time I didn&#039;t. </p><p>Thoughts?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>noahplusplus</strong> on 27 Dec 2013, 08:37)</p>
