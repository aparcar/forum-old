					<p>Hi There,</p><p>I have installed coova-chilli 1.2.9-1 with openwrt r31650 on my tl-wr84n router. The coova-chilli package comes with a few problems. First of all, it doesn&#039;t include the startup script. I got a sample startup script but it didn&#039;t work without some modifications. Finally I am at the stage showing the coova redirect page. But then it complains that login.chi file missing. I found a sample login.chi and copied under /etc/chilli/www. But it doesn&#039;t work because it seems that this package is missing the option --enable-miniportal when being compiled. So just one login.chi won&#039;t resolve the problem. Is there anywhere we can find a package compiled for tl-wr84n with that option enabled? Or is there any other way to have the miniportal setup properly?</p><p>Thank you in advance for any help or hints.</p><p>Liang</p>									</div>

					<p>Progress made for this problem:</p><p>Downloaded a source zip from coova.org and compiled it with --enable-miniportal. Copied all files to /etc/chilli/www. Note a few files such as coova.* needed copied or kept from original www directory. This fixed login.chi not found problem and got the initial coova page but still hanged when redirecting to login.chi.</p><p>Liang</p>									</div>
