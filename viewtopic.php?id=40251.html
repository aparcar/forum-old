					<p>The title says it all <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />I want to do a little change to a source and then make the package with the new source but every time I run &quot;make&quot; the source is being restored to its original state. Can I make it skip the restoration of the source?<br />Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>what is the path to the source file? I&#039;d need to reboot in linux to check, but there is a path to the &quot;originals&quot; and a path to what the make command generates.

					<p>Thanks!<br />Are you sure there is a folder with the sources extracted where I could change them or do I have to extract them myself, change them, pack them again to a .tar.gz and put it back in place?</p><p>btw, if anybody knows, is there a way to do something like &quot;make --noextract&quot; ?</p>									</div>

					<p>You can directly modify the source that lies in the main Openwrt source tree. e.g. [openwrt.git]/target/linux/ar71xx/base-files/sbin/wget2nand. But if you want to modify a source file from a package that is downloaded during the make process, you need to create a patch file for that package and place that patch file in /patches directory of the package. Then Openwrt make will automatically patch the downloaded sources again at the next make.</p><p>There can be several patch files, which will be applied in order.<br />Wiki has info, but a bit complicated: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/patches">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/patches</a></p><p>Bug tracker is down, so I am providing links to nbd&#039;s git mirror.

					<p>Thank you very much for the detailed answer.</p><p>I ended up extracting the sources, modifying them and putting them back to an archive with the same name under the folder &quot;dl&quot;. This way the files were extracted from my archive instead of from the original and I didn&#039;t have to create a patch for that.</p><p>Knowing how to create a pach it useful but fortunately I didn&#039;t need it this time.</p>									</div>
