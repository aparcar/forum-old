					<p>Hi,</p><p>there is a thread (<a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=11451">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=11451</a>) which mentions to put x.x.x.254 entries for gateway and dns into /etc/config/network and another one (<a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=11909">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=11909</a>) where this is said to be unneccessary.</p><p>I can only state that my setup (which is standard, I think) doesn&#039;t work without them. It is an asus wl-500gp with pppoe to a dsl modem on the wan side. I do use </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#### VLAN configuration

I am quite surprised that those lines are needed for basic functionality but are not included in the default config and are not mentioned in any documentation except the post mentioned above.</p><p>So what do those entries do? What is the reason that I need to add them for a standard router config? Or maybe there is something else wrong with my setup?</p><p>Best regards,<br />Jens</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello Wodin,</p><p>thanks a lot for your answer. I used the following script to help testing it<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cat /bin/netzwerktest.sh &gt; /tmp/nw.txt
echo &quot;---- trenner&quot; &gt;&gt; /tmp/nw.txt
cat /etc/config/network &gt;&gt; /tmp/nw.txt
echo &quot;---- trenner&quot; &gt;&gt; /tmp/nw.txt
ifconfig -a &gt;&gt; /tmp/nw.txt
echo &quot;---- trenner&quot; &gt;&gt; /tmp/nw.txt
netstat -rn &gt;&gt; /tmp/nw.txt
echo &quot;---- trenner&quot; &gt;&gt; /tmp/nw.txt
iptables -t nat -nvL &gt;&gt; /tmp/nw.txt
echo &quot;---- trenner&quot; &gt;&gt; /tmp/nw.txt
iptables -nvL &gt;&gt; /tmp/nw.txt
for n in /tmp/resolv*
  do
    echo &quot;---- trenner: ${n}&quot; &gt;&gt; /tmp/nw.txt
    cat ${n} &gt;&gt; /tmp/nw.txt
done</code></pre></div><p>and while doing it I had to find out that this time it works without both of those entries in question. I am really surprised as I did install OpenWrt three times, documented every step in every install and had to use those entries every time to get a working connection. Really strange.</p><p>So I just stop trying different combinations now. However, a partial result: the line<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface lan
    option dns    &#039;192.168.23.254&#039;</code></pre></div><p>just results in<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>nameserver 192.168.23.254</code></pre></div><p>being added to /tmp/resolv.conf.</p><p>Well, I&#039;ve been curious and reenabled both lines: the gateway line does not make any difference in the script&#039;s output?!?! Yes, I did a &quot;uci commit network&quot; and did even reboot the router...</p><p>Best regards,<br />Jens</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pflantz</strong> on 28 Feb 2008, 18:40)</p>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have the same problem. I use OpenWRT on a WRT54GL and have a DNS problem too.<br />Wan to internet work. Lan to Internet work only if I config my eth0 at my Lan PC with the IP of the nameserver it is shown in /tmp/resolv.conf.auto it works.<br />All of my other Routers was able to handle the DNS IP from the Wan that the routers IP is the DNS IP for the PC</p>									</div>
