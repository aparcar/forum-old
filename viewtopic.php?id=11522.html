Removing an essential package may lead to an unusable system, but if you enjoy that kind of pain, you can force ipkg to proceed against its will with the option: -force-removal-of-essential-packages</em></p><p><em>Nothing to be done<br />Successfully terminated.</em></p><p>how can i remove it!?</p><p>shit: now i removed the ipkg. how can i get it again on my busybox?</p><p>a lot of greetings from austria.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>onlineuser</strong> on 6 Jul 2007, 01:08)</p>

					<p>It sounds me strange. If your network parameters are correct, you would be able to ping any host.<br />I don&#039;t know what firmware version are you using. Actually, ipkg is an essential package for the applications management. Why don&#039;t you reflash your AP with a package set which already includes ipkg?</p>									</div>
