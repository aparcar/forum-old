					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to install the AR7 port of OpenWRT on my DG834Gv2.<br/>I built it from the today SVN version (3599) and flashed the image on the device (openwrt-dg834-2.4-squashfs.img).<br/>But I don&#039;t know if it was successful as I can&#039;t get telnet access. I tried the old IP (192.168.0.1) and also 192.168.1.1 but it doesn&#039;t work.<br/>Thanks for any help.</p><p>Nicolas</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br/>I guess you flashed the image thru the Web interface, and I think you should&#039;ve done it thru the FTP server in the ADAM2 boot. But that&#039;s also my problem, right after booting with &quot;my_ipaddress 192.168.x.1&quot; (x=0 or 1) added to the /proc/ticfg/env file, I cannot get to the ADAM2 FTP server port 21.<br/>Can anyone help us?</p><p>Thanks in advance<br/>Manuel</p>									</div>
