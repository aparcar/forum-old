					<p>I use a mobile connector cable (USB) for use with Siemens C55 (http://www.preisroboter.de/n/4250465168654.html 5-10Eur).

The plug for connect to phone was cut and the 3 lines is that what you want (black: GND, blue: TX, white: RX). The VCC is not nessary because the adapter got its vcc from usb.
