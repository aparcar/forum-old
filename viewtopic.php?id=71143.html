I used this address because in the 2nd boot after resetting the firmware was loaded from this address.</p></blockquote></div><p>When you boot into the U-boot environment and interrupt the boot process, you should be able to use &#039;printenv&#039; to obtain the U-boot&#039;s environment variables (<a href="https://www.denx.de/wiki/view/DULG/UBootEnvVariables">https://www.denx.de/wiki/view/DULG/UBootEnvVariables</a>)</p><p>From these, check especially the &#039;bootcmd&#039; and &#039;bootargs&#039; variables, and any other variables mentioned in the manual. I cannot help you in analyzing what these variables mean to your specific system, because I do not have nor have I ever seen the hardware that you&#039;re using.</p><p>If you are unsure on &quot;How stuff works&quot;, here&#039;s a short intro to get you started:</p><p>1) The CPU is reset, either by command or by power cycle</p><p>2) There are usually jumpers or pins on the PCB which dictate where the CPU will start to look for executable code once it comes out of reset</p><p>3) The CPU starts executing the specified code; this is usually the U-boot which resides somewhere on non-volatile memory (flash). It might be the &quot;general flash chip&quot; or on a separate chip. This depends entirely on the hardware layout and the state of the jumpers/pins.</p><p>4) The U-boot is paired with a set of environment variables that are written on non-volatile memory as well; it loads these variables into memory</p><p>5) The U-boot uses the environment variables to set-up the hardware, configure flash layout parameters and so on</p><p>6) Once the hardware is initialized, U-boot executes the &#039;bootcmd&#039; command, which usually contains instructions on where to find the compressed kernel image</p><p>7) The kernel image contains a small decompression algorithm header that will decompress the actual kernel image into memory into a hard-coded memory address</p><p>8) The U-boot then relinquishes execution to the decompressed kernel, passing in any necessary arguments so that the kernel can begin booting</p><p>What you need to do now is consult the U-boot manual (<a href="https://www.denx.de/wiki/DULG/Manual">https://www.denx.de/wiki/DULG/Manual</a>), and use the commands that available to analyze and completely understand the boot mechanism of your specific system. Understand how the flash memory is laid out, what bad sectors there are, which sectors are protected and so on. Analyze the environment variables, see what they contain, take a pen and paper and draw yourself a map which shows how your system boots.</p><p>Finally, you need to find a kernel image that is intact and suitable for your system. I recommend contacting the manufacturer of your board for a recovery image, and flash it to your system once you know the ins and outs.</p><p>This should get you back to a situation where your device at least works.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Antek</strong> on 6 Jun 2017, 12:47)</p>

Actually, the normal device also stuck at the &#039;Booting Atheros AR934x&#039; message, but I can access the wireless management webpage (192.168.1.20) normally, while the webpage is unaccessible for my bricked device.</p><p>Then I found something interesting in environment variables. There is a variable named &#039;mtdparts&#039; of the normal device:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mtdparts=mtdparts=ath-nor0:256k(u-boot),64k(u-boot-env),1024k(kernel),6528k(rootfs),256k(cfg),64k(EEPROM)</code></pre></div><p>compared with my bricked device:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mtdparts=mtdparts=ath-nor0:256k(u-boot),64k(u-boot-env),1024k(kernel),5760k(rootfs),256k(cfg),64k(EEPROM)</code></pre></div><p>I changed the `rootfs&#039; size of my bricked device to 6528k, now it can boot normally, and I can get the 192.168.1.20 webpage.</p><p>But, this change is not persistent. I tried `saveenv&#039; command, and also tried `protect off all&#039; command to disable protection of FLASH, but everytime I reboot the device, the `rootfs&#039; size changed back to 5760k, and the device get bricked again.</p><p>The result of `saveenv&#039;:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Saving Environment to Flash...

But the environment variables are just not persistent.</p><p>Also I tried to directly boot from memory address 0x80000000, skipping `erase&#039; and `cp.b&#039; steps. For both OpenWrt and LEDE firmware, it reports the decompress error message, just like <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>   Verifying Checksum at 0x80000040 ...OK

Having the OEM-variant of the Rocket M5 for comparison is truly helpful.</p><p>The log from saving the environment variables looks normal. I do not know why the data doesn&#039;t persist over reboot. The save command is toggling off the protection, saving and protecting again, so things should work. Perhaps there is a problem with the actual Flash chip itself? Maybe it is broken? Or maybe there&#039;s an even deeper protection layer somewhere that we do not see yet?</p><p>You can try this with the Rocket M5 that is working, if you are not afraid of breaking it.
