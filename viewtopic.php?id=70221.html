					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have set up on my WDR4300 Openvpn and created 2 Vpn profiles (1 tun/1 tap).<br />When i connect to the TAP i can access the services running on the router (e.g SMB), while when i connect to TUN, i cannot access SMB.<br />While being connected to TUN, i can ping devices on lan, and after a port scan i did, i also see the SMB ports open.</p><p>Any ideas?<br />Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Hm..How can i check this?<br />Since i see the port open while connected to the TUN, doesn&#039;t this mean that the firewall is not blocking the connections from TUN -&gt; LAN?</p><p>EDITED: I can see all the devices on my other subnet, but i cannot access their services.<br />For example, i can access the web interface of a IP Camera i have on Lan, but i cannot get the video stream on the app on my computer.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Pasxalisk</strong> on 15 Mar 2017, 10:27)</p>

					<p>Looks like a firewall issue. Are you sure you have allowed both TCP and UDP protocols to be forwarded from VPN to LAN ? If HTTP (TCP) works but more complex services do not, perhaps there is something blocking UDP.</p>									</div>

					<p>Let me explain this:</p><p>Let&#039;s suppose you have a 192.168.1.x network at LAN, and a 10.0.0.x network at TUN. This means your SMB server (not your firewall) and all your LAN devices are receiving connections from a computer in the 10.0.0.x range, while they&nbsp; expect connections coming only from computers in the 192.168.1.x range, and thus refusing the connection.</p><p>Or at least that is my guessing...</p>									</div>

					<p>I see. What will work in this scenario and what will not depends on the particular applications and firewall restrictions on each host.</p><p>For example: MS Windows default firewall rules do not accept SMB connections from outside the local subnet. If you have few computers to access and can change their configuration, it is possible to change their firewall rule to also allow 10.0.0.0/24.</p><p>Another option, which is sort of a workaround to fool your internal host&#039;s, is to create SNAT rules through<br />LuCI -&gt; Network -&gt; Firewall -&gt; Traffic Rules -&gt; Source NAT (at the bottom of the page).</p><p>There you can specify to have packets coming from the VPN to have their source address rewritten with the router&#039;s own LAN address 192.168.1.1.</p>									</div>
