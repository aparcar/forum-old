					<p>I have been reading the documentation about setting up openwrt for my home network, however I have not found anything upon the subject of Transparent NAT and multi-IP DMZ, or I found several contradictory &quot;How To&#039;s&quot;.<br />my current setup is is a Thomson ST546 DSL Modem/Router, Cisco SG100D-08 with a WAP54G as the wireless access point.</p><p>My WAN is DSL PPPoE with a /28 IP block (n.n.n.176/28) I hope to split this into two /29 blocks in the future when server 2 is relocated.</p><p>I run two Centos 5.5 servers, Server 1 is my server, server 2 is a friends which I am running for him while he has his house renovated (its an old farmhouse and its taking a while).</p><p>Block 1 - network n.n.n.176; gateway n.n.n.177; reserved for future broadcast n.n.n.183 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Server 1 uses addresses: DNS (Bind 9) - n.n.n.178; HTTP - n.n.n.179; HTTPS - n.n.n.180; smtp/imap - n.n.n.181</p><p>Block 2 - reserved for future network address network n.n.n.184; reserved for future gateway n.n.n.185; broadcast n.n.n.191<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Server 2 uses addresses: DNS (Bind 9) - n.n.n.186; HTTP - n.n.n.187; HTTPS - n.n.n.188; smtp/imap - n.n.n.189</p><p>Non-servers systems are 3 Laptops (may use either wired or wireless connection depending upon where the kids decides to work) and 3 or 4 Desktop all these systems are on 192.168.40.1/26 (LAN1).</p><p>On the ST546 I can setup create two LAN address blocks - 192.168.40.1/26 (LAN1) and n.n.n.176/28 (LAN2), I then use 1-1 NAT to pass outside addresses through to the inside addresses (transparent NAT). The firewall is then setup to allow LAN1 -&gt; LAN2, WAN -&gt; LAN2, LAN1+LAN2 -&gt; WAN all other traffic is dropped.</p><p>=====</p><p>What I want to do is create a similar setup, preferably with greater security, plus IPV6 (HE 6in4) support. <br />I was wondering if I should take two of the 3700s ports and make them into &quot;DMZ1&quot; and &quot;DMZ2&quot; one per server, with remaining port used for LAN.</p><p>Part of my problem is that I have not found a good explanation of how the various part os the UCI and the UCI config files hang together?</p><p>Any help appreciated.</p><p>John A</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zzz2002</strong> on 26 Feb 2011, 04:53)</p>
