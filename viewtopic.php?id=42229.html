					<p>hi all,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to set up a NAT box, I would like the WAN port to be on an external network (dhcp) and the LAN ports and wireless on the same (though different to the WAN port) subnet. I think I have achived this but I am having some trouble getting the ports forwarded so I can share the internet connection from the WAN port internally on the LAN + wireless. </p><p>From a machine connected to the wireless I can ping the router and gain a correct IP address but cannot access anything on the WAN side of the router.</p><p>/etc/config/network</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;lan&#039;

					<p>If I understand you correctly, this scenario does not need any settings, because this way is openwrt configured from the firstboot. If it does not work for you, you must have screwed something somewhere, I&#039;d reset router to defaults (using firstboot command), enable wifi and set password and you should be ready to go.</p><p>If this does not work, maybe you need to restart cable modem or even change MAC address of your wan interface, because some cable providers allow user to use only specific mac address, which you have used for the first time.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the reply, </p><p>Yes you understood correctly, what I want is probably what my grandma would call a router.</p><p>I thought thats what I did... Just to check I ran firstboot again, changing nothing and the same symptoms presented themselves.</p><p>It might be worth noting that I have full internet access on the router it just seems not to be forwarded to anything connected to the LAN</p><p>Thanks again</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t know what can be wrong, you can try this, but I&#039;m only guessing. Do you know IP of your WAN interface? Run ifconfig and look for inet addr. It is possible, that your WAN adapter has got the ip from the same subnet 192.168.1.0 and so there can be conflict in routing, you might want to change from your default option ipaddr &#039;192.168.1.1&#039; to for example 192.168.100.1, then your router will have this ip and assign ips from 192.168.100.x subnet. Don&#039;t forget to reboot <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

					<p>The WAN port is connected to a dhcp server and has been given an ip 10.x.x.x which I would expect not to interfere with the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet, slowly giving up on this as a lost cause <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Right, I re-flashed to BB and this has now given me access to the external network (I am unsure whether this was the case before), however, still not the internet (which the router still has full access to).</p><p>So the LAN ports are correctly assigning things in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet, the wan port has been assigned the correct address in the 10.X.X.X/16 subnet, and is receiving an internet connection from the gateway on that subnet.</p><p>The devices connected to the LAN port (on the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet) can see devices in the 10.X.X.X/16 subnet, but not anything past the gateway...</p><p>this is with the default settings.</p><p>any ideas?</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Edit: I have now learned this is called &quot;double NAT&quot;, I have changed the title of the thread. btw I have no control of the external network that assigns an address to the router.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Scratch</strong> on 23 Feb 2013, 23:17)</p>

					<p>changed the router back to stock firmware and it all works fine, maybe this is a bug in the latest trunk for the DIR-615 D4(with the DIR-600 firmware)?</p>									</div>
