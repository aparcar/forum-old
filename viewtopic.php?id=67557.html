The idea is to have a router that will provide free guest Wi-Fi and capture and store the data of visitors who connect with the device through social media accounts (Facebook, Google+). </p><p>Please provide your contact information if you&#039;re interested, and I will reach out to you providing more details.</p>									</div>
