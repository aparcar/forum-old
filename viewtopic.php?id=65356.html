					<p>I picked up an <a href="http://techobsessed.net/2016/05/airmobi-ireceiver-teardown/">iReceiver, a cheap WiFi audio receiver that supports AirPlay and DNLA</a>. It works with the stock firmware, but I want to get OpenWRT running on it so I can take care of some stupidity in the networking configuration, and so I can use shairport-sync, instead of a dated version of shairport.</p><p>From <a href="http://techobsessed.net/2016/05/airmobi-ireceiver-teardown/">my teardown</a>, I know that it is based on a Ralink RT5350F, with 32MB RAM and 8MB of flash.</p><p>Using the serial headers I found, I&#039;ve <a href="http://techobsessed.net/2016/06/airmobi-ireceiver-preliminary-software-hacking/">obtained access to the UBoot console, and, once linux boots, gained access to a root shell</a>, which led me to a telnet server and a hidden webpage that I can use to fire it up.</p><p>From here on, I&#039;m going to proceed cautiously because the device doesn&#039;t have an ethernet port, making recovery from a botched firmware more difficult. I am planning on building firmware that enables WiFi by default.</p><p>I guess my first question is whether I should do something about the bootloader. The stock uboot looks is based on Ralink&#039;s uboot version.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>U-Boot 1.1.3 (Apr 23 2014 - 10:15:13)
[...]
============================================ 
Ralink UBoot Version: 4.2.S.1
 </code></pre></div><p>It includes the loadb command to load an immage over serial using kermit, which I think should let me recover from a bad firmware version by loading a known-good version into over kermit and booting it. Unfortunately, it looks like <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=44472">loadb is/was broken in Ralink&#039;s u-boot</a>.</p><p>Does anyone know if the bug is fixed in the version I&#039;m using? Or, barring that, can anyone point me to a compiled bootloader with a working loadb for RT5350F boards that I can install?</p><p>I think that&#039;s it for now, though once I&#039;m confident I can recover from a bad firmware, I may have more questions.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eas</strong> on 6 Jun 2016, 08:57)</p>

					<p>4.2.S.1 is a quite old version</p><p>current is 5.0.1.0 as i know<br />and usually you don&#039;t need loadb cuz tftp recovery works flawlessly</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks.</p><p>I&#039;m interested in LoadB because the device doesn&#039;t have wired ethernet, at least not without hacking on magnetics and a physical interface.</p>									</div>

					<p>you can get ralink u-boot source here <a href="https://bitbucket.org/padavan/rt-n56u/commits/all">https://bitbucket.org/padavan/rt-n56u/commits/all</a><br />or here <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/wive-ng/wive-ng-mt/ci/master/tree/">https://sourceforge.net/p/wive-ng/wive- â€¦ ster/tree/</a></p><p>both repos contains uboot 5.*.*.* and can build rt5350 image<br />but be careful with build settings, flashing wrong uboot image or image built with mistakes can cause bricking, only programmer will helps</p>									</div>
