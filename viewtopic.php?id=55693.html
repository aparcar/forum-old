					<p>Hi,</p><p>I work on a project using OpenWrt distribution on Carambola2 device.<br />I would like to use &#039;gsoap&#039; library in my custom software. For that I use makefile from &quot;<a href="https://github.com/tobiaswaldvogel/openwrt-addpack">https://github.com/tobiaswaldvogel/openwrt-addpack</a>&quot;.<br />I added this link to file &quot;feeds.conf.default&quot;, and everythings seems to be ok when I get packages using feeds update and install commands.<br />After &#039;make menuconfig&quot;, I can then select &quot;libgsoap&quot;.<br />I finally run a make, but an error occured during compilation. By activating verbose mode, I can see a first error :</p><p>install -d -m0755 /media/vincent/Hdrive/Vincent/G2MicroBox/carambola2/staging_dir/target-mips_34kc_uClibc-0.9.33.2/root-ar71xx/tmp-iw/usr/sbin<br />/bin/bash: ../../gsoap/src/soapcpp2: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error<br />make[8]: *** [wsdlC.cpp] Error 126</p><p>I do not know why this error occured, and if it is the one which failed compilation.</p><p>I am new in Openwrt (and more general in Linux), so I do not know if I made the correct steps or not.</p><p>Is someone had the same issue with gsoap ? Do you have any idea of what happen in my case ?</p><p>If necessary, I can give additionnal logs displayed during compilation.</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p><p>Vincent</p>									</div>
