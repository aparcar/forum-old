					<p>I am presently successfully using OpenWRT installed on a WRT1900ACSv1.<br />I also own a WRT3200ACM with which there are problems concerning the radios simply disconnecting; this appears to require a router power cycle to rectify.<br />I believe that there are fundamental problems with the radio drivers in the 3200 firmware - I have seen a suggestion that it is the wrong one!<br />Could members clarify the situation for me and explain quite where the problem lies, who will provide a solution and how will I find out about any revision or correction.<br />I have sought to find out from web sites various, but I am afraid that I tend to get a bit lost.</p><p>Regards,&nbsp; lim</p>									</div>

					<p>My embarrassingly belated thanks for the response.&nbsp; I have looked at the link provided and see that there are problems with the radio driver(s) - I presume that the statement &quot;Fix is under working&quot; indicates that it is in hand by someone.&nbsp; A key player seems to be &#039;<em>yuhhaurlin</em>&#039;, but I wonder if this person is connected with Marvel or whether they are part of the OpenWRT community.<br />The last comment on the topic at the link was 3 weeks ago and one must wonder if it is being taken seriously.&nbsp; There must be quite a lot of WRT3200s which are not properly usable in a wireless fashion due to this driver problem.&nbsp; Can anyone explain the sequence of events/how the wheels turn?</p><p>Regards,&nbsp; lim</p>									</div>
