					<p>I&#039;m having quite a battle here.</p><p>I need to include the *SNAT and *DNAT .so files in /usr/lib/iptables, and can&#039;t figure out quite how to get things configured.</p><p>I notice some anomalies that I&#039;m sure explain the problem I&#039;m having, but I don&#039;t know how to interpret them.</p><p>In .config, on a pristine checkout, after running make menconfig and immediately saving it we see:<br />. . <br />CONFIG_PACKAGE_iptables=y <br />CONFIG_PACKAGE_iptables-mod-conntrack=y<br />CONFIG_PACKAGE_iptables-mod-extra=y<br />CONFIG_PACKAGE_iptables-mod-filter=y<br />CONFIG_PACKAGE_iptables-mod-imq=y<br />CONFIG_PACKAGE_iptables-mod-ipopt=y<br />. . . </p><p>I&#039;m pretty sure this is why I can&#039;t do anything with those packages when I do a &quot;make menuconfig&quot; again:</p><p>&nbsp; ? ? &lt;M&gt; kmod-ebtables.................................

					<p>There are two places where iptables are configured. The first is in the kernel drivers and the second is the iptables application. The iptables application can be configured in Base System-&gt;iptables (CONFIG_PACKAGE_iptables). You will notice that the iptables is configured by default to * and depends on several kernel drivers which is why you see some of the drivers with the --- indicator. To determine dependencies, go to an item with --- displayed and press the ? key. You will see what module(s) selected the item as a dependency.</p><p>iptables is broken right now (or at least for port forwarding and qos). Here is a <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/1772">ticket</a> with a discussion that I am assuming is relevant to your situation. Currently the DNAT, SNAT and layer7 shared libraries are being compiled but not packaged ... or at least that is what I make of it after a cursory look.</p>									</div>
