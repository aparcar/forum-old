					<p>Hi,</p><p>First, I must ask that you be gentle with me as this is my first post...And it&#039;s rather long, which i apologise for..</p><p>Secondly, I must mention that I am a Linux midget..</p><p>I am trying to get ulog working on my wrt.&nbsp; I have used the latest snapshot &amp; installed the ulogd package - fine.&nbsp; The ulogd is logging to my &#039;mysql&#039; server, all that is working.</p><p>What&#039;s not working is my iptables will not recognize ulog as a target.&nbsp; Specifically it returns:</p><p>&nbsp; iptables v1.2.11: Couldn&#039;t load target `ULOG&#039;:File not found</p><p>I tried installing the module with &#039;insmod ipt_ULOG.o&#039;, and a &#039;lsmod&#039; replies that it has loaded the module.&nbsp; But it still doesn&#039;t work.</p><p>Does ULOG have to be built in to the kernel?&nbsp; If so, would it be possible to have it build into the next snapshot? (remember, i am a linux midget!)</p><p>Thanks for any assistance you can provide..</p><p>Cheers,<br />./j</p>									</div>

					<p>this should be frequently asked question #123325423<br />(with the 123325420 before it also being the exact same question)</p><p>You assume that just because you&#039;ve loaded something new into the kernel that iptables should magically know exactly how to use that new feature.</p><p>You&#039;re missing /lib/iptables/libipt_ULOG.so.</p><p>2nd question: how do you get libipt_ULOG.so?</p><p>It&#039;s part of the iptable source, look at PF_EXT_SLIB in the extensions/Makefile.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>thanks for the response.&nbsp; Maybe I should have been more specific.</p><p>I am using the binary image openwrt-g-code.bin as found in the latest snapshot.&nbsp; I am not compiling myself, on account of being a linux midget. :-)</p><p>1.&nbsp; I guess what i want to know is, is ULOG compiled in this build, and if not, could the excellent maintainers of this great package perhaps include it in the snapshots?</p><p>.. maybe this request belongs else where??</p><p>Thanks again..</p><p>cheers,<br />J</p>									</div>
