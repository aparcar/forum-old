					<p>Great. Just bought myself another wrt54gs to expand my network to my living room. I have wall connectors near my DSL modem, where I take signal with rj-45 to my fuse box, where I have placed my wrt54-gs number 1 (Main router) and there&#039;s wall connectors that lead to my guest/computer room and to my bed room. Now I wanted to set up a link to my living room (I have a laptop + dvd player with network connection there) and thought that best way to do it, would be getting another wrt54 and use it as a wireless bridge.</p><p>Just was hoping that new version would be ready before I&#039;d start to install a custom firmware.</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>1) Someone to make a list of biggest changes to older openwrt?<br />2) Wasn&#039;t there a thread about missing SIPs etc..<a href="http://www.openwrt.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=596">click me for that thread</a>[/url]</p>									</div>

My patch first resets the netfilter with vanilla 2.4.20 kernel versions (this nukes the SIP stuff also) and then applies the netfilter patch-o-matic patches. Re-adding Nico&#039;s SIP patches should be fairly easy. Just try applying his patches after mine.</p><p>Andreas</p>									</div>

And as we don&#039;t have good quality pictures pf a v2.2, we can&#039;t even be sure about the changes. You could flash via tftp, but I advise You to stick to the original firmware until we have pictures or a v2.2 unit.</p>									</div>
