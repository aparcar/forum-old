					<p>&gt;BARRIER BREAKER (Bleeding Edge, r39076) will not let me install the driver update.</p><p>You can install the latest (BB) trunk using sysupgrade and immediately install the packages you need before your kernel becomes out of sync with the current packages, or install Attitude Adjustment (if available for your device)--the AA packages can be installed at any time since they will not become out of sync with the kernel.</p>									</div>
