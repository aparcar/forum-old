					<p>hello,<br />I consider buy a Netgear DGND3700B-100GRS N600 Modem-Router (ADSL2+ (Annex B).<br />I am going to use it as a second router, first is from ISP.<br />In manual I have read that this router does not support modem USB.<br />Is it possible to install open source firmware and use its usb ports to use usb modem?<br />Is it really a good choice to buy this router for ca 25 $?<br />Regards,</p>									</div>
