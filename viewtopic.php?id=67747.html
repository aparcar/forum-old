					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I finally managed to setup my adhoc network and test a udp multicast using iperf. I used iw to set the multicast rate to 54 Mbps, however,for whatever reason, the multicast rate appears to be limited to around 24 Mbps. I can do better than that over TCP/IP, so I suspect that mcast_rate is capped somewhere in OpenWRT. Can anybody confirm this?</p><p>Another thing is I ultimately want to multicast using 802.11n rates with 40-MHz bandwidth. Does anybody have any hints on how to do this? The mcast-rate set by iw seems to be limited to 11g rates.</p><p>thanks,<br />Aaron</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, after some further checks, the UDP is increasing as I increase the mcast_rate all the way up to the 54 Mbps rate. So it seems that the efficiency is not very good. It gets about 25 Mbps max. So the question remains, how do you set 11n rates for multicast? Also, any tips on how to improve efficiency are welcome.</p><p>Aaron</p>									</div>

					<p>aaron have you made any headway on this?<br />am trying to run 18 or 24MBit multicast...&nbsp; <br />have tried:<br /> &quot;dev wlan0 set mcast_rate 24&quot;<br />&nbsp; am getting &quot;dev: not found&quot;</p><p> &quot;iw wlan0 set mcast_rate 24&quot;<br />am getting:&nbsp; &nbsp;command failed: Not supported (-122)</p><br /><p>thoughts?</p>									</div>
