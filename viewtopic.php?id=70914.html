					<p>Possible causes:</p><p>a) DHCP server disabled on the LAN-side (or are you using DHCP-relay from the main router?)<br />b) Missing switch-device configuration in /etc/config/network (if your router model has a built-in switch device)<br />c) Something else wrong in /etc/config/network, such as extraneous VLAN-configs or something?</p><p>Other than that, I think posting the remaining configs here as well may help?</p><p>/etc/config/network<br />/etc/config/dhcp<br />/etc/config/wireless</p>									</div>
