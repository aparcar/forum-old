					<p>Buy a second router with a 3.3 volt serial console. Most routers have two serial consoles. Flash both routers with OpenWrt and use one as a remote serial console. Then you only have to directly connect RX - TX, TX - RX, GND - GND. Install minicom on one the routers and that&#039;s it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Yanira</strong> on 29 Sep 2008, 16:19)</p>
