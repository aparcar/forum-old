					<p>Hello all.</p><p>I&#039;ll appreciate your help with this issue. I have two D-Link DIR-825 wired together with an utp cable. I want that my laptop perfoms handovers between them choosing the best server. Also I Know that handover is managed and performed by clients. I&#039;ve read that with WDS can be possible do what I want but I don&#039;t want to get the link between routers through the wireless conection. In other words I want to keep the wireless interfaces clean just for users traffic. It is possible to configure both routers to interchange information about clients using my wired &quot;backbone&quot; It would be awesome it&#039;s possible.</p><p>I&#039;ve set the same SSID in both routers in different channels with the same password using WPA security. the first one is plugged to internet and the second one should be an slave.</p><p>Any help will be appreciated because I want to add more devices</p><p>Regards!</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your input FYI .. very profound like always enjoyed it.</p><p>So i did a little roaming on your links and came to same conclusion as 3 years ago :</p><p>&nbsp; There is alot of &quot;cooking&quot; but no success at the end. A least i could not find a decent description of final useful outcome. <br />&nbsp; So i suppose they all gave in at the end and left it to the &quot;profesionals&quot; doing their propietary solutions.</p><p>&nbsp; The &quot;ingredients&quot; are in hostapd and erverybody seems to cook, but no &quot;soup on the table&quot;.<br />&nbsp; I hope i would taste some one day...so to say.</p><p>Meanwhile for pratical purposes ( and more than 2 routers) and messing with tunnelling, i turned to Layer-2-Mesh-adhoc, which of course is not appropriate for normal AP-Client direct connections, but gives me IP-free node connections distributing L3-traffic.<br />So no TCP drop and&nbsp; additonally having AP&#039;s on every mesh-node with a central DHCP service and AAA. So no problem with clients changing IP on handover.</p><p>Multi-WAN ist still a a subject to be worked on. </p><p>How this may help in the case of &quot;extend wireless range with wired routers&quot; i can judge after i do know more about the scope of seebaastian&#039;s application.</p><p>Lets see; quite interesting matter anyway</p><p>regards</p><p>3zl</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello All. I&#039;ve appreciated your fast answer. Here is the deal. My home have 2 floors. My master DIR-825 router is placed in the library room located in the first floor. The problem begins when I try to have a decent signal strength in the second floor in my bedroom which is a lot of bricks walls away. So I wired a utp cable extension from the bottom router to be used with the second DIR-825. I enabled the 2.4 GHz radio in both routers but in different channels (master in channel 1 and slave in channel 11). I also configured the same SSID expecting that my laptop wireless adapter switch from one to another making that process transparent to the users (my little&nbsp; brothers). Routers have installed OpenWrt trunk (r29614).</p><p>I&#039;m wondering if my laptop can perform handovers between routers. I&#039;m going to try with a different one. Also the laptop uses Windows 7 pro.</p><p>The connection between routers is a cat6 ethernet cable like 60 feet long. If I plug another laptop using one of the lan ports I can get an IP address from master and also I can surf the web.</p><p>Here is my scheme:</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://public.blu.livefilestore.com/y1pK1vepaNBbmT1ESf6QHKnzSL3zSC48gdOSKv4_Ntt22mKwCtsDf3CxaqfC1ZD04G7dsF4p9DBU6LDolw_klouaQ/wireless%20scheme.png?psid=1" alt="https://public.blu.livefilestore.com/y1pK1vepaNBbmT1ESf6QHKnzSL3zSC48gdOSKv4_Ntt22mKwCtsDf3CxaqfC1ZD04G7dsF4p9DBU6LDolw_klouaQ/wireless%20scheme.png?psid=1" /></span></p><p>Thank you for your support,<br />Seebaastian</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>seebaastian</strong> on 8 Jan 2012, 22:33)</p>

					<p>I believe that you have done your best.</p><p><a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Wireless_access_point#Roaming_access">Wireless access point - DD-WRT Wiki</a><br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p><strong>Roaming access</strong></p><p>If you are installing additional Access Points to cover a broader area with Wi-Fi access, it is possible to allow clients to roam freely between them. The common method is to <strong>use the same SSID and Security settings</strong> on each access point.<br /><strong>Use a different channel on each AP</strong>.</p></blockquote></div><p>And I think the main issue resides in the wifi clients.</p><p><a href="http://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=102282">Wireless LAN Fundamentals: Mobility &gt; Characteristics of Roaming</a><br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p><strong>The Nature of Roaming in 802.11</strong></p><p>802.11 roaming is known as &quot;<strong>break before make</strong>,&quot; referring to the requirement that a station serves its association with one AP before creating an association with a new one. This process might seem unintuitive because it introduces the possibility for data loss during roaming, but it facilitates a simpler MAC protocol and radio.</p><p>If 802.11 were &quot;make before break,&quot; meaning a station could associate to a new AP before disassociating from the old AP, you would need safeguards in the MAC to ensure a loop-free topology. A station connected to the same Layer 2 broadcast domain via simultaneous network connections has the potential to trigger broadcast storms. A &quot;make before break&quot; architecture would necessitate an algorithm such as 802.1D spanning tree to resolve any potential loops, adding overhead to the MAC protocol. In addition, the client radio would have to be capable of listening and communicating on more than one channel at a time, increasing the complexity of the radio (and adding to the overall cost of the devices).</p></blockquote></div><p>So I think the best you can achieve right now might be &quot;802.11r or Fast Roaming&quot; but it depends on whether your wifi clients support it or not. If you have wireless USB dongle with Ralink SoC, you can take a look at Ralink Wireless Utility (RaUI). Under Advanced tab there&#039;s an option,<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>[] Fast Roaming at?[-70] dBm</p></blockquote></div><p>I think it defines when the wifi client should start to look for another access point. Untested.</p><p><a href="http://www.wireless-nets.com/resources/tutorials/how_roaming_works.html">How Wi-Fi Roaming Really Works</a><br /><a href="http://www.iometrix.com/whitepapers/Iometrix_WPv3.pdf">Testing WLAN Roaming Step by Step</a></p>									</div>
