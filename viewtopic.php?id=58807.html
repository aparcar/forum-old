					<p>Hey there,</p><p>I&#039;m hoping someone can shed light on an issue I&#039;m having. First, my apologies if this was already worked out in another thread somewhere else on this board, but I didn&#039;t turn up anything while searching..</p><p>I&#039;ve got a Linksys 1900AC v1 flashed to chaos_calmer, and haven&#039;t really configured much at this point. I&#039;ve got SSIDs set up, and both WLAN instances are working. However, the radio configured for AC is slow, and only reporting 54 mbps as its maximum bandwidth in luci as well as CLI. I&#039;ve checked around, and can&#039;t seem to find any useful information regarding why this is happening, and how to address it - but speedtests suggest this is accurate, as I am getting ~18-20 Mbps down max (on 50 Mbps Comcast service). Before flashing, I was pulling my full down speed WAN side and ~400 LAN side.</p><p>I&#039;ve included a bit of output below, but please let me know what else would be helpful to see and I&#039;ll happily provide it. </p><p>root@OpenWrt:/etc# cat openwrt_release <br />DISTRIB_ID=&#039;OpenWrt&#039;<br />DISTRIB_RELEASE=&#039;Bleeding Edge&#039;<br />DISTRIB_REVISION=&#039;r46514&#039;<br />DISTRIB_CODENAME=&#039;chaos_calmer&#039;</p><p>root@OpenWrt:~# iwinfo<br />....<br />wlan1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ESSID: &quot;That&#039;s what she SSID&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Access Point: 00:25:9C:13:A6:CE<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mode: Master&nbsp; Channel: 40 (5.200 GHz)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tx-Power: 17 dBm&nbsp; Link Quality: 52/70<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Signal: -58 dBm&nbsp; Noise: -90 dBm<br />---&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; Bit Rate: 51.3 MBit/s&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;---<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Encryption: WPA2 PSK (CCMP)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Type: nl80211&nbsp; HW Mode(s): 802.11nac<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hardware: 11AB:2A55 11AB:0000 [Marvell 88W8864]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TX power offset: none<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Frequency offset: none<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Supports VAPs: yes&nbsp; PHY name: phy1<br />DISTRIB_TARGET=&#039;mvebu/generic&#039;<br />DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=&#039;OpenWrt Chaos Calmer r46514&#039;<br />DISTRIB_TAINTS=&#039;&#039;</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s amazing how different devices behave differently. </p><p>My daughter has a Lenovo Yoga2 with AC wifi. On Stock Linksys FW we could only manage around 144mbps, but on OpenWRT, there are no issues downloading up to 244mbps or more. It says it connects to OpenWrt SSID with a theoretical DL speed of 780mbps, but I realize that will not be achieved. </p><p>It&#039;s the only device we have that is AC capable, but it is still interesting how the opposite was true with this device.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davidc502</strong> on 3 Aug 2015, 17:17)</p>

					<p>Also, just noticed you mentioned Radio 0 being different. I&#039;m not so sure that will help my issue with AC, given radio 0 is configured for 802.11g, but I&#039;ll give it a try anyway.</p>									</div>
