This drive is shared by Samba with anonymous access (without any user/password). Shared drive is mounted [mount -t cifs .... ] on my Arch Linux machine that is connected to WiTi by cable (no other client is connected). I did the test using DD:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dd if=/tmp/test.bin of=/mnt/share/test.bin bs=4M</code></pre></div><p>Test file is 1024MB, /tmp is in RAM. I have tried several block sizes (bs=1M, bs=2M, bs=4M) with the same result. The writes speed is ~1MB/s. <br />For read test I used the same approach:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dd if=/mnt/share/test.bin of=/tmp/test.bin bs=4M</code></pre></div><p>This gives around 65MB/s. </p><p>I have also observed CPU load during write test and it was very low ~1% and there is nothing in log files. I wanted to test Samba performance with dbench <a href="https://dbench.samba.org/">https://dbench.samba.org/</a> but for some reason it was not working with WiTi samba configuration :-(</p><p>Then I have tried local write speed on WiTi. Unfortunately OpenWrt version of DD does not print statistics so I used less precise method:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>date &amp;&amp; \
dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/test.bin bs=4M &amp;&amp;\
date</code></pre></div><p>And then I calculated speed from time before and after. I was roughly 12-15MB/s that is also quite low but still much better than Samba performance.</p><p>So from read speed it is clear that network thoughput is not limiting write speed and HDD speed should not be limiting as well.</p><p>What is HDD write speed that you can achieve?</p>									</div>

					<p>Generally radio (WiFi) in the main line openwrt lies and squeals (kmod-mmc, etc. also) - completing the development of drivers, system, etc. It is so far distant history even as this device - except that you do not see that except for the addition of support generally lasted some work on improving what already is added and adapt to what is changed, developed for ramips/mtk7261/etc. The creators and producers of devices do not offer anything for mainline openwrt, in addition to its proprietary version of openwrt based on BB and the proprietary SDK from the manufacturer mtk7621 - or they chose the easier path...<br />This does not bode too well for the future of this equipment in openwrt.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>build000</strong> on 19 Dec 2015, 06:21)</p>
