					<p>I have finally manage to get hold of a free (from the trash) router that supports OpenWRT, a Netgear WDR1000v2</p><p>I managed to flash CC 15.05 onto it and it worked, but luci was acting a little off when trying to configure the firewall. So, I decided to upgrade to CC 15.05.1, which went fine and the router ran. The problem was that the config was lost and subsequently any changes that I made to the config were lost upon reboot. looking through the logs, I saw</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Sun Jan 31 17:35:25 2016 kern.err kernel: [    9.810000] jffs2: Too few erase blocks (4)

					<p>I used Image Builder and removed the PPP packages as I don&#039;t need them. Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 now runs and configuration is being written to flash. I tried the official release again, just to check, and te original problem returned. So it seems that there is definitely a problem with the official image of 15.05.1 and the Netgear WNR1000v2.</p>									</div>

					<p>Can you upload your build? I am having the same problem, I think everything is saved in the RAM and it erases every time upon reboot, when I go to the software tab in OpenWrt it shows 16mb, way more than the 4mb flash.</p>									</div>
