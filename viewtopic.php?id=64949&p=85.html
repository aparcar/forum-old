					<p>For those running dnscrypt, I made a very simple script that will update the dnscrypt-resolvers.csv file only if an updated version has been published to the website.&nbsp; You can add a cron task (Go to System --&gt; Scheduled Tasks in Luci) and add the line</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>0 3 * * 2,5     sh /etc/upgraderesolv.sh</code></pre></div><p>to run it every Tuesday and Friday and 3am.&nbsp; Of course, you can change how often it is run and the location and name of the script itself.&nbsp; Or you can just run it manually whenever you decide to.</p><p>You should also go to LuCi --&gt; System --&gt; Backup / Flash Firmware and Click the configuration tab and enter</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/etc/upgraderesolv.sh</code></pre></div><p>or whatever you name it and where ever you save it, so that it will be added to your backups.&nbsp; The cron task is automatically backed up.</p><p>Anyway, here is the script.&nbsp; It&#039;s very basic, but it gets the job done.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
