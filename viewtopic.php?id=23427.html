					<p>Hi,</p><p>I need to build network where might be few nodes, WRT54GL:s. And I need captive portal solution that could show the network-rules to the users (splash mode). Does anyone know how to to implement centralized MAC-authentication and what captive portal solution would be best fit to this? </p><p>Thanks for any answers,</p><p>Mikko</p>									</div>

					<p>Your centralized MAC-auth and showing a splash page will probably be mutually exclusive with most available software.<br />Everything that I have seen has done the mac-auth at the dhcp stage, which I&#039;m sure you can appreciate is well before they request any web page.</p><p>The only thing I could think of would be to have an insanely long radius timeout (minutes instead of seconds) in the hope that someone would try to browse before they were authenticated. That would be a poor user experience though.</p>									</div>

					<p>The nice user experience is the key to the whole system. So basicly I would like to do system that where would be no authentication at all, at first. Only the rules of the network should be shown at beginning.&nbsp; And Only if some abuse of the network is detected, then I would like to be able to deny access for that MAC-address in every node of network. And if there&#039;s like ~10 nodes, it would be nice to add that filter in only one place, instead of adding it in every WRT through ssh.</p>									</div>
