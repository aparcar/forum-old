					<p>I&#039;ve spent hours upon hours this week looking for GPIO 5 with no success. I had printouts of the board and marked every point I tested so I wouldn&#039;t miss any. I have a feeling they do not exist and have decided to re-compile the mmc driver to replace GPIO 5 with GPIO 2. Has anyone else done this, it&#039;s a but confusing..</p>									</div>

					<p>I finally got my SD card working on a WRT54G v4. I gave up on GPIO 5 and used GPIO 2 instead (White LED).

					<p>Just curious if you checked the legs of the chip for the GPIO or just random solder points on the board?&nbsp; Checking the legs is probably the easiest way to find out if there actually is a GPIO 5 on the chip.&nbsp; They may have completely disconnected it from anything else since it&#039;s not used.&nbsp; When we get ours to the lab, I&#039;ll check it out as well, but GPIO 2 is fine w/ me.</p>									</div>

					<p>They switched to a different style processor in the V4; no longer are the legs just exposed.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t say that my look is at all conclusive, just saying that I couldn&#039;t find it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p><p>-Duffin</p>									</div>

					<p>That is true, forgot about that.&nbsp; I&#039;m used to v3.&nbsp; Guess they don&#039;t want us playing w/ stuff like that.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been trying to get white papers from Broadcom for awhile since we&#039;re using a WRT54G for our senior design project.&nbsp; They&#039;re really not interested in helping out students it seems.</p>									</div>

					<p>All of Broadcom&#039;s stuff is under NDA.&nbsp; Seeing no one can find GPIO 5, has anyone looked at the new switch solder points?&nbsp; I haven&#039;t had a chance to look at it much as it&#039;s at my friend&#039;s house, but it&#039;d be awesome if we could use that switch as another input instead of using the buttons that are already in use.</p>									</div>
