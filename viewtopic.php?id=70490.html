					<p>Hello, I have a netgear r6220 and when I install openwrt lede firmware from telnet, I get 350mb/s without problem, but after &quot;opkg update&quot; command and reboot I get 95mb/s and I am unable to find the problem. (I use cat7 cable)</p><p>I have been able to verify that after some restart it sometimes gets 350mb/s.</p><p><strong>EDIT: If I reconnect the wan cable to the bridge router I get 350mb/s, It seems to be a router driver problem, I had this problem in the past with a network card on my computer connecting it to the bridge router</strong>, I never have this problem with the stock firmware of the r6220</p><p>My Internet adapter have the drivers installed and If I connect the computer to the bridge router I get 350mb/s without any problem.<br />Regards.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jonatanpradasn</strong> on 5 Apr 2017, 04:49)</p>

					<p>Are you sure its the driver to blame?</p><p>I have a cable from the 2nd floor to the basement connecting two TP-Link 4900 which might have broken shielding.
