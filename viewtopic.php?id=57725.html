					<p>Hi,</p><p>OpenWRT serves DHCP request just fine in a /24 subnet.<br />In a bigger subnet there seems to be a missing option somewhere to more specifically specify how you want to set the dhcp range.</p><p>For instance, i have the network subnetmask:<br />255.255.0.0 (or /16) on the 10.0.*.* range.<br />I want DHCP to hand out IP&#039;s in the 10.0.3.* range. <br />I know, i change change the subnet to 255.255.255.0 which would &quot;fix&quot;this, but i don&#039;t want that. I want other devices in the other ranges. DD-WRT can do this just fine so i guess OpenWRT should be able to handle it as well (if one knows the options to set..).</p><p>So i either want to fill in a range like this:<br />3.0 - 3.150</p><p>Or with the full ip:<br />10.0.3.0 - 10.0.3.150</p><p>Does anyone know how i can get that done using dhcp?</p><p>Cheers,<br />Mark</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey there.</p><p>Which document exactly lacks that information?</p><p>The regular &quot;dhcp&quot; wiki page I know about does state it clearly. <br />See <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/dhcp">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/dhcp</a> on the table described as &quot;Below is a listing of legal options for dhcp sections&quot;.<br />There are both, &quot;start&quot; and &quot;limit&quot;.</p><p>The LUCI input for DHCP configuration labeled with &quot;Limit&quot; has a question mark icon stating: &quot;Lowest leased address as offset from the network address.&quot;</p><p>If you know about any documentation handling DHCP but missing either &quot;start&quot; or &quot;limit&quot;, could you please link it to allow somebody to adjust it?</p><p>Btw: Currently you can still use &quot;10.0.3.1&quot; as &quot;limit&quot; value. Although *that* is not part of a documentation this setting currently works. Being a lacy reader, I just added that value to my LUCI panel, didn&#039;t think about it because it worked. Then read the wiki documentation about DHCP and remembered &quot;wow, I just did it slightly different&quot;.</p><p>I don&#039;t know if this method is supposed to continue working but as of current stable BB it works.</p><p>As an additional note: Your description is kind of wrong when you talk about &quot;I might want to join multiple networks in this one big subnet&quot;.<br />There are no sub-subnets within 10.0.0.0/16 if your subnet mask is /16. There is just one subnet.<br />You cannot have one computer at 10.0.0.1/16, a second one at 10.0.0.2/24 and a third one at 10.0.1.2/24 and expect them to interact properly. Either you have one 10.0.0.0/16 subnet and have all nodes within that /16 or you have multiple smaller ones. Then your router needs to have multiple interfaces, one for each small subnet. But configuring them &quot;sub subnet within /16 and one overloard accessing the whole /16&quot; isn&#039;t possible.<br />In one 10.0.0.0/16 you have the 10.0.0.0 as network and 10.0.255.255 as broadcast. The 10.0.0.255 as well as the 10.0.1.0 are just a regular node address.<br />In 10.0.0.0/24 you have the 10.0.0.0 as network as well but the 10.0.0.255 is not a regular node but the broadcast address.<br />So mixing different subnet masks for overlapping IP ranges leads to pretty unexpected errors.</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>									</div>

I meant exactly what i said, join multiple networks within the same subnet scope.<br />So:<br />Network 1: 10.0.1.* (subnetmask 255.255.0.0)<br />Network 2: 10.0.2.* (subnetmask 255.255.0.0)<br />etc...</p><p>I know it works because i&#039;ve had that working for a couple of years with site-to-site networking via dd-wrt and vpn using a tap interface. Specifically NOT tun! I don&#039;t know why you assume that other networks might have a /24 subnet since i gave no hint of that. But lets not discuss that in this topic. It&#039;s not an issue at the moment and i don&#039;t even know if i&#039;m going to set this up again (since it&#039;s very difficult to get right).</p>									</div>

					<p>I just want to say thanks for this thread. It helped me configure a multiple /24 subnet spanning DHCP setup.<br />Yes, all information is already properly stated in the wiki. But this thread is really helpful, being a bit more verbose with the equations for calculating the DHCP range ;-)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pklaus</strong> on 22 Apr 2016, 20:50)</p>
