					<p>Hi, i just flashed my asus wl500gp with kamikaze 8.09 openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx</p><p>All is working well except the wireless part. I already replaced the hostapd-mini package with hostapd and installed kmod-madwifi.<br />The wireless configuration was done with LuCI-Webinterface.<br />But i can&#039;t get a signal, the router doesn&#039;t show up...<br />Sometimes after rebooting the router it stays down, no connect via telnet, webif, ssh, no connection to the internet. the only thing that works is connection to another LAN-computer. i tried several times and always had to re-flash the device.</p><p>Did i miss to install a package or is there more configuration needed?</p><p>Could someone tell me if it is possible to set up wireless with the TL-WN560G mini-pci card?</p><p>thanks in advance,<br />toyboy</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>toyboy</strong> on 11 May 2009, 18:29)</p>

					<p>hostapd-mini should be fine, what you need to remove is nas.<br />You need to change /etc/config/wireless (broadcom to atheros). The wireless interface name will also change so you might need to update your config files.</p>									</div>

					<p>nas: the problem is it doesn&#039;t get recognized by default, and after installation of the package &#039;kmod-madwifi&#039;, configuration of the wirelles lan via LuCI and a following reboot the router refuses to work at all. it just doesn&#039;t boot up anymore... I think i might have missed to install something? what packages do you have installed? i connected the antenna at &#039;main&#039;. could you provide me a list of your packages?</p><p>anyway: does the broadcom mini-pci card work as well with the 2.6 kernel? i thought it didn&#039;t, thats why i got the TL-WN560G.</p><p>zorxd: i don&#039;t have the package nas installed, i think that&#039;s needed while running the 2.4 kernel... ?</p><br /><p>regards<br />toyboy</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>toyboy</strong> on 12 May 2009, 20:22)</p>
