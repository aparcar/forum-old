Most factory firmwares have a setting to block certain domains, which is something entirely different and much easier to do.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>So how to enable the same after installing OpenWrt ?

Unless you don&#039;t want to set up each software on each client individually this proxy would have to be a &quot;transparent proxy&quot;. These are the keywords you can use to find various approaches on the OpenWRT website and in this forum.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 26 Apr 2013, 20:14)</p>
