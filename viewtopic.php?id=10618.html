					<p>I am a long time user of dd-wrt, but recently have grown tired of the somewhat unstable nature of some of the builds.&nbsp; I use Sputnik (<a href="http://www.sputnik.com">http://www.sputnik.com</a>) to operate my Hotspots and have always been enthused of dd-wrt support for this service. </p><p>Is there any type of package the allows Sputnik to be utilized with OpenWRT?</p><p>cjkeeme</p>									</div>

					<p>I guess you just have to &quot;extract&quot; the needed binaries, and it should work.. dd-wrt uses our kernel and most of our patches, so it sould &quot;just work (tm)&quot;</p>									</div>

					<p>Am I really the only one interested in this addition for OpenWRT?&nbsp; I&#039;m going to look over the &#039;Documentation&#039; section to see what type of other Sputnik-type services OpenWRT supports.&nbsp; Does anyone have recommendations for me?</p><p>Honestly, I&#039;m tired of DD-WRT and it&#039;s shady administration.</p>									</div>

					<p>I use ChilliSpot to run my network.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t seen a lot of interest in Sputnik around here, seems more a service for outsourcing.&nbsp; I already have a RADIUS server and ChilliSpot is easy enough to setup, why would I want to share money with Sputnik?&nbsp; Not criticizing your setup, just pointing out maybe different philosophies at work here.</p>									</div>

					<p>Oh, I do agree completely.&nbsp; I could setup RADIUS &amp; ChilliSpot, but this is a one man operation with already to many clients to make a major switch.&nbsp; I could however slowly migrate, but the costs associated may not make that feasible to go with ChilliSpot (more colocation, time, hardware, servers, documents, etc). </p><p>Is there any other popular portal service used with OpenWRT that is more turnkey?</p>									</div>
