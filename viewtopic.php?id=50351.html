					<p>Today I bought another WDR4300 router, flashed with the latest firmware (trunk build &quot;Barrier Breaker&quot;) and messed up my /etc/config/network. As a result I can&#039;t no longer access my router.</p><p>I made a change on vlan &#039;1&#039; from: <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>option &#039;ports&#039; &#039;0t 2 3 4 5t&#039;</code></pre></div><p>to</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>option &#039;ports&#039; &#039;2 3 4 5t&#039;</code></pre></div><p>How can I reset my network settings?</p><p>I tried:<br />1. connecting LAN cable to all ports (WAN firewalled, wifi disabled by default). Naturally it didn&#039;t help</p><p>2. resetting the router based on <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300</a><br />a) I pressed reset button then power on... it didn&#039;t help. I believe the router got into failsafe mode (because it lid up &#039;tools&#039; LED).<br />b) I pressed reset button for 8 seconds when I saw a star LED flashing... didn&#039;t help too</p><p>Correct me if I&#039;m wrong the only way out of this is to order USB to UART adapter (someone on this forum suggested to buy cp2102) and follow failsafe procedures?</p><p>On a side note, when a router goes into failsafe mode, I read that it should be accessible on this IP 192.168.0.86? When, I believe, the router was in a failsafe mode and I tried pinging 192.168.0.86, it just didn&#039;t respond (my IP was set to 192.168.0.55)...</p><p>Thanks for your feedback</p>									</div>

					<p>I re-read the failsafe manual as you suggested and managed to get into failsafe mode. I&#039;m not sure what exactly triggered it. This time I used IP address 192.168.0.2 instead of 192.168.0.55. Another thing new thing is that I actually unplugged the power adapter instead of using power switch on the router.</p><p>I spent half of the day trying to figure out how to fix my issue and another where to order USB -&gt; UATT...</p><p>Many thanks to you!</p>									</div>

					<p>Maybe someone might find this useful in future... I had to get my router into failsafe mode again and it only worked when I unplugged the power adapter. It didn&#039;t work with the power switch.</p>									</div>
