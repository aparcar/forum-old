					<p>Hello,</p><p>I just upgraded to the latest (r33409) community release of arokh for my WNDR3700v2. All went fine, except that my SixXS tunnel did not work anymore. I found out, that the init-Script was missing, which was obviously removed because of incompatibilities with the terms of SixXS.</p><p><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/32666">https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/32666</a></p><p>I then created a config file manually and started the tunnel manually. But more problems arises:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Succesfully retrieved tunnel information for T12345
sock_printf()  : &quot;QUIT Every Time We Live Together&quot;
Tunnel Information for T12345:
POP Id      : qwert09
IPv6 Local  : 2001:1234:e000:153::2/64
IPv6 Remote : 2001:1234:e000:153::1/64
Tunnel Type : ayiya

RTNETLINK answers: No route to host

I then started the commands by myself, and the third command failed:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ip -6 addr add 2001:1234:e000:153::2/64 dev sixxs
RTNETLINK answers: Permission denied</code></pre></div><p>I could fix that by enabling IPv6 on the sixxs interface<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>echo 0 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/sixxs/disable_ipv6</code></pre></div><div class="codebox"><pre><code># ip -6 ro add default via 2001:1234:e000:153::1/64 dev sixxs
Error: an inet address is expected rather than &quot;2001:1234:e000:153::1/64&quot;</code></pre></div><p>Any ideas? The whole aiccu support seems to be gone pretty much.</p><p>Or is there another way to run a SixXS tunnels nowadays? </p><p>Regards,<br />falstaff</p>									</div>
