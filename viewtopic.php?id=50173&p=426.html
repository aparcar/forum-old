					<p>@mrfrezee<br />I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s normal, but certainly not right given what I am trying to achieve. Thanks for the keen eye. I do have the /dev/crypto file. I flashed another image with define changes for openssl. My numbers were better, but still not great, so went back to check on whether the CESA define was in my build_dir config file, and it was not. So that earlier change set is not taking effect. I have created a patch from the nitroshift link and doing a new build for another test.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>anomeome</strong> on 5 Apr 2016, 05:08)</p>

					<p>@mrfrezee<br />Correct, even though I had set it to &#039;y&#039; in the config-4.4, it was not showing up in the mvebu_v7_defconfig file for me. I had to create a patch file from the git. My normal procedure would be to do just a <em>make clean</em>, unless things have gone South in my build dir.</p><p>Edit:<br />New <a href="http://pastebin.com/sdUA1DRS">paste</a>. Included settings used in the openssl.cnf file. Numbers are better but lower than post by InkblotAdmirer, especially aes-128 which is what started me down this path. Still something not quite right with my build.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>anomeome</strong> on 5 Apr 2016, 18:49)</p>
