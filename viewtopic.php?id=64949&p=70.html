I recommended NTFS because I had read somewhere of better performance, but in this particular case the user got worse performance... go figure.&nbsp; A few of my own tests showed that trying to transfer a file larger than 1 GB using ext4 would just fail every time. However, formatting NTFS allowed 1 GB and even larger files to at least transfer, and the speeds in my case were the same; around 100mbps. Not stellar speed, but at least would go through.</p><p>Currently running&nbsp; a couple of USB 2.0 speed tests. Will report back the findings</p>									</div>
