					<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>First post, I&#039;v to say, what a nice project ! I&#039;m a really happy user of OpenWRT backfire on my WRT 160 NL <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I&#039;m looking forward to see the final release of barrierbreaker (would like to have uci support with fw3 for ipset, which isn&#039;t in backfire apparently) and therefore, I&#039;m wondering if it is supported to upgrade from backfire to barrierbreaker ? </p><p>If not, what is the advised method to do this migration?</p><p>Thanks in advance for all your advises,</p>									</div>

Many configuration files have changed and I think you&#039;ll be happier in the long run.</p>									</div>
