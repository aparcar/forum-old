However, in late 2015, TP-Link changed the hardware configuration without bumping the hardware version number, v2.0 devices with serial numbers greater than 215C use a gd25q128 flash chip, which is supported in trunk as of r47588 and in custom compiles of 15.05.1 newer than r49220. Either of these options are confirmed to work, although the kmod-ath10k driver (for 5GHz Wi-Fi functionality) and LuCI (if desired) will need to be installed as packages after the firmware is flashed.</p></blockquote></div>									</div>

					<p>Hello, everyone!</p><p>I own an Archer C7 v2 and I&#039;m have some issues with 5GHz network. I keep having some random&nbsp; disconnects/reconnects, like if the service is restarting or something. It requires no action from me to have it back when it drops, but it&#039;s annoying... happens like 1 time each day/2 days.</p><p>Anyone aware of that, and is there a fix for it?</p><p>P.S.: 2.4GHz network runs flawlessly.</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p><p>Cheers!</p>									</div>
