					<p>I would like to intercept incoming packets on the wifi link and do XOR operations on the TCP payload in transit.</p><p>Currently I am wondering if it&#039;s possible to use iptables or netfilter to get that type of functionality. I&#039;ve seen scripts that let you modify TTL headers and compute checksums, but I want to be able to access the data payload itself. Is there an easy solution for ddwrt or openwrt?</p><p>Alternatively, is there any similar project with opensource code which I could borrow and tweak?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello Hyseda,</p><p>I too am doing something similar.&nbsp; Ultimately I want to control incoming data streams, TCP and possibly UDP (nonsensical since UDP is not a stream..) and I intend to do so by managing acks and offered windows in the outgoing TCP.&nbsp; I actually feel fairly comfortable with that.</p><p>My intention is to build a Netfilter module so I can grab the packets going by.</p><p>I would be quite interested in sharing the experience with others - I am too tired of working solo.</p><p>However, I am have a really hard time getting started.&nbsp; It has been extremely difficult to get a basic netfilter module built in OpenWrt, I&#039;m lost in include path hell, a problem that I will be describing in a separate thread.</p><p>If you are interested, I would not mind starting a side conversation on our efforts.</p><p>best,<br />Andy</p>									</div>
