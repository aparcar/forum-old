					<p>If have managed to brick and revive my router four times in the last month (that&#039;s once every weekend for those counting) trying to get a wgt634u to be a wireless client on and print server on my 802.11b/g network with WPA PSK. At our house we already have one Wgt634u running stock firmware as the AP. What I am looking for is:</p><p>WGT634U AP &lt;----wireless----&gt;WRT Wgt634u<br /> |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br /> W&nbsp; &nbsp;W&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;P&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;W&nbsp; &nbsp;W<br /> i&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; i&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; r&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; i&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;i<br /> r&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;r&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; i&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; r&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;r<br /> l&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;e&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;e&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;l<br /> e&nbsp; &nbsp; d&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; t&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; d&nbsp; &nbsp; e<br /> s&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; e&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;s<br /> s&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; r&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; s</p><p>If I understand correctly, I am trying to creat a bridge in client mode. I don&#039;t care if the WRT gets it&#039;s IP&#039;s from the AP DHCP or assigns it&#039;s own reserved subset (192.168.1.50-100 perhaps?)</p><p>I flashed the newest WGT634u build of Kamikaze 7.09 w/ Webif from X-Wrt.com. I turned off WPA PSK and tried the directions on the KamikazeClientMode Wiki page, as well as the client mode instructions on the Wgt634u Wiki page.&nbsp; The directions off the Wgt634u wiki page did nothing but require a restore of the firmware configuration file in Web^if. The wiki page for client mode gave a few pointers. but was of little help. I edited my config/wireless to the following:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-device      wifi0
        option type     atheros
        option channel  8
        #option disabled 1
config wifi-iface
        option device   wifi0
        option mode     sta
        option ssid     Arch13
        option hidden   0
        option encryption none</code></pre></div><p>I rebooted and now my wireless was turned on. I logged into web^if, changed the wireless Dbm to 12dbm instead of the default 0 and rebooted. It started up, but it did not seek out and join Arch13 on channel 8, which I guess I thought it would. So i logged onto Web^if again , went to the site survey options, and allowed the wifi to scan for networks. It saw Arch13, and I pressed &quot;join&quot;. It said &quot;Could not configure Wl0, Join successfull&quot;. Well gee, of course not since on the Wgt634u it&#039;s called Wifi0, not Wl0. So I facepalmed myself in frustration, reflashed the firware and said &quot;That&#039;s it, I&#039;m asking the community.&quot;</p><br /><p>I understand how to use VI, but simply do not know what settings to change. After rebricking for the 5th time last night, I figured it was time to ask for help. Does anyone have previous experiance with the WGT634U in client mode who can share their experiance?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Arch13</strong> on 7 Apr 2008, 23:13)</p>
