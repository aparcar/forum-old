					<p>Thanks for the link LittleIdiot.&nbsp; I was finally able to get the USB audio working on my WRTSL54GS.&nbsp; I am using a $20 USB audio adapter from Radio Shack (CMedia chipset).&nbsp; I installed the packages and loaded the modules as described in the section for Polypaudio ... except I left out Polypaudio and went with mpd from the RC5 backports repository.&nbsp; Had a few little roadblocks to overcome (eg: I had to reference /dev/sound/dsp instead of the default /dev/dsp) but not too bad.&nbsp; Using a remote CIFS fileshare to store my music and the web-based console phpMp2 from musicpd.org, this makes for a pretty sweet setup!</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, the method here described works but... what a poor quality!</p><p>I&#039;m using the same setup that works great with Oleg&#039;s custom firmware (<a href="http://wl500g.info">http://wl500g.info</a>) and there&#039;s no way to compare the results.

					<p>hmm, you must be doing something wrong. usb audio works perfectly fine for me ever since I&#039;ve installed it. The only problem was that the usb audio stick didn&#039;t like the USB 2.0 hub, but as soon as I put in on USB 1.1 hub or directly onto the asus usb port, it works great. I&#039;m not using alsa, just straight OSS.</p>									</div>

					<p>Mmmm.. i&nbsp; made my test connecting the audio stick directly to the router. My experience with Oleg&#039;s firmware is that through an hub it would not work, so i didn&#039;t even considered it.
