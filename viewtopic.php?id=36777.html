					<p>I have a TP-Link 703n and following the wiki have successfully installed openwrt. The box is alive and I can talk to it via SSH (actually using WinSCP). What I want to do is install LuCI so I have a GUI to work with. The problem is I can&#039;t get net access to the 703 so the opkg update command returns &quot;bad address &#039;downloads.openwrt.org&#039; <br />Is there anyway I can download LuCI, put it in the right directory (/tmp?) with WinSCP and then run a command line to install it?<br />I have searched everywhere for help on how to do this but it eludes me.<br />Any help appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>My WR703N arrived yesterday, but this morning is the first chance I&#039;ve had to play with it. </p><p>Getting the router&#039;s packages updated/installed is very straightforward. My home LAN doesn&#039;t use 192.168.1.0/24 so I had to change the router&#039;s IP details as well as setting up DNS. Here&#039;s how I did it.<br />* Plugged the WR703N into my existing LAN switch and turned it on.<br />* Set my computer&#039;s IP address to 192.168.1.2/255.255.255.0 (no gateway)<br />* Connected to the WR703N via Telnet and set a password, which disabled Telnet and enabled SSH<br />* Reconnected via SSH and changed the IP address of the router to one suitable for my home LAN (uci set network.lan.ipaddr=X.X.X.X / uci set network.lan.netmask=X.X.X.X / uci set network.lan.gateway=X.X.X.X / uci set network.lan.dns=X.X.X.X - change X.X.X.X each time to suitable values)<br />* Rebooted the WR703N<br />* Changed my computer&#039;s IP address back to its normal one<br />* Reconnected to the WR703N via SSH on its new IP address<br />* Issued the command &quot;opkg update&quot; followed by &quot;opkg install luci&quot;<br />* Issued the command &quot;/etc/init.d/uhttpd start&quot;<br />* Pointed my web browser at the IP address of the WR703N</p><p>Before carrying out the above steps I read <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/internet.connection">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/internet.connection</a> to get an idea of what commands to use, and where I&#039;d need to change certain details to fit my home LAN.</p>									</div>

					<p>This is very helpful. I have the same interest as Alan. I&#039;m dealing in aps that generally don&#039;t get connected or configured to the net. It would be nice to just be able to manually flash Luci</p>									</div>

					<p>Just thought this would be the best place to post (and ask)</p><p>There are some dependency issues while doing the &quot;minimalistic installation&quot; of luci as mentioned in <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials</a> (tested with Trunk):</p><p>Error:<br />Installing luci-lib-core (trunk+svn9576-1) to root...<br />Collected errors:<br /> * satisfy_dependencies_for: Cannot satisfy the following dependencies for luci-lib-core:<br /> *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lua *&nbsp; &nbsp;libuci-lua *&nbsp; &nbsp; libubus-lua *<br /> * opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package luci-lib-core.<br />...</p><p>The additional required packages are: lua, libuci-lua, libubus-lua; which in turn need: liblua.</p><p>So, we can rewrite the installation script as:</p><p>for pkg in liblua lua libuci-lua libubus-lua uhttpd luci-lib-ipkg luci-i18n-english luci-sgi-cgi luci-lib-core luci-lib-nixio luci-lib-sys luci-lib-web luci-proto-core luci-theme-base luci-theme-openwrt luci-mod-admin-core luci-mod-admin-full; do opkg install /tmp/luci-offline-packages/$pkg*.ipk; done</p><p>OT: Additionally, for basic wireless config to work: libiw, libiwinfo, libiwinfo-lua</p><p>Does anybody know where to post this change request to the wiki?
