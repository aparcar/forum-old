					<p>I just noticed that when I do df, the 1st item shows 100% usage (others &lt; 20%). All examples I can find on this forum also show 100% for this (but everyone seems be having a problem of some sort).&nbsp; Can&#039;t find this mentioned specifically in the docs either. </p><p>Specifically, is </p><p># df<br />/dev/root&nbsp; 1024 1024 0 100% /rom <br />:<br />:</p><p>normal? </p><p>Thanks,<br />-gds</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, its normal. the rom image is just as big as it needs to be to have all the files on it, therefore there are 0 blocks free and its 100% full. <br />Also, /rom is a readonly filesystem so there is no reason it should have blocks free anyway.</p>									</div>
