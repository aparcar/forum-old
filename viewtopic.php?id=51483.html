					<p>I&#039;m trying to set up a TP-Link router WDR4300 (I flashed OpenWRT onto it) and use my old Netgear DGN2200 as only a modem (in Bridge mode). But I&#039;m having trouble, so right now I don&#039;t have internet in my apartment (I&#039;m posting you via Cellphone).</p><p>I just got off the phone with Bezeq (phone company, copper wires, not ISP) and the tech helped me to set the DGN-2200 to bridge mode (we also restored it to,&nbsp; factory settings). I accomplished that using laptop&lt;-&gt; Ethernet &lt;-&gt;DGN-2200.</p><p>I&#039;m now connected <br />Laptop&lt;-&gt; Ethernet &lt;-&gt;TP-Link. I need to enter my Netvision ISP  username and password, and I guess some more settings (Wi-Fi password) I don&#039;t find these in OpenWRT. Can you help me do this?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>webmanoffesto</strong> on 7 Jul 2014, 14:18)</p>

					<p>Problem solved.</p><p>This is now essentially two networks. The TP-Link network, and the Netgear network.<br />On the old Netgear router.

They look technically impressive, but are probably beyond my ability.</p><p>This setup works with DGN2000, never tried it with DGN2200. You can test it though:</p><p>1. Access the web-user interface of the modem by typing <a href="http://192.168.0.1">http://192.168.0.1</a> in the address field.<br />2. When prompted, enter “admin” for the username and “password” for the password (if you haven&#039;t changed yet the password for the interface).<br />3. Once logged in change the address URL in the address bar from: <br /><a href="http://192.168.0.1/setup.cgi?next_file=start.htm">http://192.168.0.1/setup.cgi?next_file=start.htm</a> <br />to: <br /><a href="http://192.168.0.1/setup.cgi?next_file=mode.htm">http://192.168.0.1/setup.cgi?next_file=mode.htm</a><br />4. This opens a hidden configuration page on router. Select &#039;Modem (Modem only)&#039; and click Apply. This will convert the router into a simple ADSL mode. Router (Modem + Router) sets the device to modem-router mode.<br />5. After setting up the modem to Bridge mode, Basic Settings option is gone under Setup tab. You could still configure the ADSL settings though.<br />6. You can now connect the DGN2200 to your router or computer and setup for a PPPoE connection.</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s not great because it can cause undefined bugs and things like port mapping become harder, and automatic port mapping stops working completely. If you don&#039;t need the above then it&#039;s OK, though it&#039;ll still be slower than a bridge setup.</p><p>I had assumed earlier you already set your modem to bridge mode as you never said you didn&#039;t. However if you haven&#039;t set it to bridge mode that&#039;ll be why it didn&#039;t work originally. I&#039;m happy to help if you describe exactly what you need, however if you&#039;re finding the instructions you found too complicated, it may not be worth changing the setup now that it already works, if you don&#039;t need the things that double-NAT breaks.</p>									</div>

					<p>I understand - I have a similar Netgear router, and an OpenWRT router.</p><p>I suggest (I think I used to do like this):</p><p>Make everything work with the Netgear only, in Router Mode, first (it sucks to not have internet access)</p><p>When the Netgear works fine, plug in the OpenWRT (as you did) and reconfigure OpenWRT<br /> - Disable NAT (you dont want double NAT as described above)<br /> - Disable DHCP (you dont want two DHCP servers)<br /> - Perhaps set a static IP to your OpenWRT</p><p>Now you have</p><p>Internet 1.2.3.4 &lt;- Netgear (NAT) -&gt; 192.168.0.1<br />OpenWRT has only ONE IP=192.168.0.2 (or something else)</p><p>All computers (including OpenWRT) should now have<br /> - Default Gateway = 192.168.0.1</p><p>You can now use WLAN from OpenWRT and/or Netgear - your choice.<br />You can also connect clients to Ethernet Ports in either Netgear/OpenWRT.</p><p>If you want to use more features on OpenWRT, you can configure your Netgear with DMZ=192.168.0.2. This will send all traffic that Netgear does not know what to do with, directly to OpenWRT.</p><p>If you want to, you can also disable DHCP on Netgear and activate it on OpenWRT (then it is probably a good idea to not use WiFi from Netgear.</p><p>Please understand there may be some information above that is not 100% accurate... There is a lot to learn about home networking, and OpenWRT is great. But I suggest focus on getting a simple setup that works first (with the Netgear), so you can benefit of the Video that you wanted in the first place. Then you can read, learn and play with OpenWRT as you have time and inspiration.</p>									</div>

The DGN2000 already does ADSL2+, which is the &quot;fastest&quot; technology to work your current DSL connection (up to something like 16000 kbit/s on the receiving end, give or take).</p><p>A new modem most probably won&#039;t speed up your line, OpenWrt certainly won&#039;t, and neither can any help from us. DSL line speeds are almost exclusively decided by your DSL provider and the actual physical quality of your line.</p><p>You <em>could</em> of course switch to another technology, VDSL or cable broadband. But this is quite a process involving switching contracts, and we cannot possibly make any recommendations, let alone an informed suggestion, to you about that.</p>									</div>
