					<p>I have an old LaFonera FON2100 laying around. So, I thought I would use its serial console port to connect to the serial console port of my bricked Netgear WGT634U. When I launched minicom, pressed ctrl-C, and switched on power on my WGT634U unit, it kept rolling without giving me the CFE prompt. In this case, I couldn&#039;t even intercept the booting process when prompted to press [f] and [ENTER] to go to fail safe mode. Also, after finished booting and prompted me with a shell, I couldn&#039;t use it as if it was frozen. I certainly would appreciate if anyone knows how to resolve this issue so that I can debrick my WGT634U. Thanks.</p>									</div>
