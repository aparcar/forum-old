					<p>I haven&#039;t tried openswan as L2TP/IPSEC terminator(*), but I can suggest some things to look for:</p><p>- tcpdump -i eth0 -n -s1500 -v gives surprisingly useful information (for openwrt, install &#039;tcpdump&#039; and &#039;libpcap&#039; packages; they&#039;re quite large, make sure you have enough space and if necessary prune your system first)</p><p>- try to work out if phase 1 and phase 2 exchanges are fully successful, and your L2TP HELLO and/or PPP LCP config-requests are actually being encapsulated in ESP (tcpdump will show you if some ESP packets are being sent)</p><p>- if not, then turn on IKE debugging at the Windows side: this is described at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/howto/ispstep.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodte … pstep.mspx</a>. Then look in \windows\debug\oakley.log for hints</p><p>- check that l2tpd is starting, and whether the tunnel has come up and pppd is started. If so, you can turn on debugging for the ppp daemon.</p><p>- if your machine has multiple IP addresses, check that the responses to the L2TP packets have the expected source address; in some cases it&#039;s possible for packets to be sent from 1.1.1.1 to 2.2.2.2, but the responses to be from 3.3.3.3 to 1.1.1.1. If so, try pointing the client at 3.3.3.3, or binding the l2tpd to a specific IP address</p><p>Incidentally, I discovered that ipsec-tools doesn&#039;t support transport mode and NAT-T at the time time. I don&#039;t know if this same restriction applies to openswan.</p><p>HTH, Brian.</p><p>(*) however I have tested Cisco IOS, Juniper Netscreen and ipsec-tools as L2TP/IPSEC terminators with XP and 2K clients</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, I have tried setting this up the other way round, with OpenWRT (openswan/l2tpd) as the client, and a Cisco 72xx as the terminator.</p><p>I see a problem very similar to yours: logread shows just &quot;LCP Conf-Request&quot; being sent. However there are some other useful things I&#039;ve found:</p><p>* If I tcpdump on ipsec0, I can see the LCP Conf-Ack&#039;s coming back from the far end correctly. They&#039;re just not making it to pppd.</p><p>* If I use &quot;netstat -au&quot; I can see:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># netstat -au

If so we&#039;re probably looking at the same problem.</p><p>l2tpd is pretty old; it might be worth trying rp-l2tp instead - <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rp-l2tp/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/rp-l2tp/</a><br />However, as it&#039;s not straightforward for me to cross-compile this right now, I might dig a bit more on the existing l2tpd first.</p>									</div>

					<p>l2tpd seems to be getting stuck in its receive loop, network_thread() in network.c. This is based on the following observations:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># echo &quot;s&quot; &gt;/var/run/l2tp-control

; This is a minimal sample l2tpd configuration file for use

;
; The idea is to provide an L2TP daemon to which remote Windows L2TP/IPsec
; clients connect. In this example, the internal (protected) network 
; is 192.168.1.0/24.  A special IP range within this network is reserved
; for the remote clients: 192.168.1.128/25
; (i.e. 192.168.1.128 ... 192.168.1.254)
;
; The listen-addr parameter can be used if you want to bind the L2TP daemon
; to a specific IP address instead of to all interfaces. For instance,
; you could bind it to the interface of the internal LAN (e.g. 192.168.1.98
; in the example below). Yet another IP address (local ip, e.g. 192.168.1.99)
