					<p>Thanks for your instructions, adas.&nbsp; Would you say everything is working with your router?&nbsp; WAN port, LAN ports, and wireless?&nbsp; If so, have you tried to use the router under a heavy load (e.g. streaming video) or in any capacity where the router fails when running DD-WRT (Client Bridge)?&nbsp; I keep flashing my router back and forth between OpenWRT and DD-WRT and neither seem to work quite right, although DD-WRT is very close...<br />-katapaltes</p>									</div>

					<p>I have not gotten Openwrt working as a client bridge, so I can&#039;t attest to that, but under a normal setup my ar430w the system has been very stable.&nbsp; It&#039;s never crashed, and don&#039;t remember any stuck beacons.<br />As to speeds, anything going LAN&lt;-&gt;LAN should be handled by the switch.</p><p>Unfortuantely, going LAN&lt;-&gt;WAN with openwrt is dismal.&nbsp; I just ran a long test and unfortunately the best speed this thing can get LAN&lt;-&gt;WAN (using iptables and NAT) is 20Mbps.&nbsp; Luckily this is all my cable connection allows, so it is not a huge problem for me.&nbsp; The problem most definitely lies in the ar2313.c or something related to it. In my case the cause of the low speeds is softirqs which consume CPU time until the router can&#039;t handle any more traffic.</p><p>I do know that the builtin firmware was able to handle 100Mbps LAN&lt;-&gt;WAN (university connection) without any problems, so this is really bad. But the builtin firmware also had really bad wireless support. Openwrt has really great atheros wireless support but of course there&#039;s the softirq problem here.</p><p>How much better is DD-WRT?</p><p>Here is DD-WRT&#039;s version of the ar2313 ethernet driver.&nbsp; I see that there are some changes including lowering the MTU from 1692 (???) to 1518 (ethernet specification) so maybe I&#039;ll try it out and see if it improves performance.<br /><a href="http://svn.dd-wrt.com:8000/dd-wrt/browser/src/linux/ar531x/linux-2.6.23/drivers/net/ar2313/ar2313.c?format=raw">http://svn.dd-wrt.com:8000/dd-wrt/brows … format=raw</a><br />DD-WRT is still using kernel 2.6.23 as their primary kernel--not sure if that makes a difference</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>phorn</strong> on 3 Dec 2008, 10:54)</p>

					<p>phorn, I don&#039;t know if current support is &quot;better&quot; on DD-WRT overall, although it certainly is for the novice user.&nbsp; No additional switch configuration or binary is needed as in OpenWRT.&nbsp; However, the current release of DD-WRT on this router seems to suffer when packets are passed from wireless to wired and when in Client Bridge mode (which could of course be related to the wireless/wired issue).&nbsp; The current last (eleventh) page of the discussion is here: <a href="http://dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=39087&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=150">http://dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php? … ;start=150</a><br />-katapaltes</p>									</div>

					<p>The switch stuff is coming-- it just hasn&#039;t been merged into the kamikaze repository but it should be released with the 8.09 final.&nbsp; (i.e. the only configuration you should have to do is setup vlans since the default config in kamikaze seems to be just plain eth0 with the switch disabled)</p><p>Have you ever noticed the ethernet performance being anything but dreadful on any version of dd-wrt?&nbsp; Or has every custom firmware had this problem?&nbsp; That thread you linked to feels very disorganized with people talking about all sorts of weird bugs.<br />(what I mean to say is, has anybody written a version of ar2313.c that has better performance that I can compare to)</p><p>I&#039;ll try to look into the ethernet performance when I have a bit more time (finals week is coming up)&nbsp; At least it should be possible to add some optimizations into the kernel...&nbsp; I&#039;ll have to try and compile that driver as a module so I can try different things and unload/reload it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>phorn</strong> on 9 Dec 2008, 10:45)</p>

If you&#039;re going to run it you&#039;ll have to download the FON version I suppose, and then install the ipkg files using opkg.

					<p>You need to enable swconfig.&nbsp; That is the new method for configuring switches:<br />swconfig dev eth0 help</p><p>I recommend just editing /etc/config/network since that now uses swconfig and it&#039;s alot easier to manage.</p><p>I also recommend not saving/applying the changes to UCI. Instead, as soon as you have made the change, do &quot;/etc/init.d/network restart&quot;--that way the changes will be reverted if you have to reset the router.</p><p>Also, could you post your dmesg--is there a specific error message you see?</p>									</div>
