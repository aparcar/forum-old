					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a WRT350N set up as a normal router (wan interface gets ip from external dhcp). During the setup of this device in switch+AP mode I&#039;ve accidentally pressed &quot;Save and apply&quot; button... I remember, that OpenWRT&#039;s internal DHCP was already disabled and internal ip for lan interface was disabled as well.</p><p>As a result:<br />a) router boots normally, gets an IP from server and pingable from external network<br />b) wifi is on is working, howewer routing isn&#039;t configured so no access to external network<br />c) I cannot connect to router because there are no internal ip<br />d) external ip denies any connection (telnet, ssh, http to luci)</p><p>Any ideas? I cannot start failsafe mode on this router pressing the WPS button (no result), and there are no any result for 30/30/30 reset. When the router starts with the reset button (near the power cord) pressed, it light the power LED yellow instead of green, but there is no any visible result <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" />((((((</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t know Marvell SoCs, I entered this thread suspecting this may be Broadcom SoC.</p><p>I believe 30-30-30 reset is also Broadcom specific, so there is no point in trying that on Marvell. And since OpenWrt doesn&#039;t use NVRAM for configuration, there is not much sense to try it with OpenWrt anyway.</p><p>If your OpenWrt configuration is really broken, your hope it to use failsafe mode.<br />If failsafe mode doesn&#039;t work, your next hope it to attach serial console and fix the config using command line.</p><p>Try to Google about connecting serial console to your model.</p>									</div>

I found an article regarding this failsafe mode on OpenWRT wiki, but there were large differences in description on wiki (mostly for TP-Link routers) and WRT350N. My router LED flashes in the following way:<br />1) power led lights green immediately after power on for 15-20 seconds<br />2) power led turns off and switch appropriate led lights up (alone) for 25-30 seconds<br />3) power led and wifi led lights up - I think for this moment the loading process is over and router starts work &quot;normally&quot;</p>									</div>

					<p>The corrrect failsafe trigger moment is quite dependent on the router model, so you need exactly correct advice. Advice for other routers does not help much. </p><p>But in general, the boot process goes: <br />1) bootloader (u-boot etc.) = &quot;hardware BIOS&quot;. Kicks in first, and here the OEM&#039;s recovery mode (like in your router) could be entered.<br />2) Openwrt pre-init. Early boot process. Starting essential services and checking failsafe trigger.<br />3) Openwrt full boot. Starting firewall, wifi, progamming switch, dhcp etc.</p><p>I would guess that for you the correct moment is when led changes from green to off and the few seconds before and after that. But that is pure guess :-(</p><br /><p>(I have recovered my own wndr3700 about a dozen times using the Netgear OEM recovery mode, and have also visited failsafe several times.)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 22 Jan 2014, 10:49)</p>

					<p>I have found a dozen different topics regarding the recovery procedure for WRT350N v2 (Marvel-based), but I cannot find even one correct topic <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>1) I have tried a dozen times to press WPS button during the restart procedure. With LAN cable plugged and not plugged... no difference. I can see a WiFi led lights in the end, so there is no default settings loaded - wifi should be switched off in default settings.

					<p>I think you are absolutely correct. Unfortunately it&#039;s quite hard to find a Windows XP machine in modern times. I&#039;ll try to build an UpSlug2 utility under MacOS X...</p><p>But anyway, now it is personal <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> I want to understand the situation. My router firmware isn&#039;t broken, bootloader is correct.
