					<p>Hi there,</p><p>I currently do have the WRT54GL which I really do love with backfire 10.03. Unfortunately my cable provider will start provide the 130 Mbps cable internet lines from next quarter on and I want to upgrade my 50 Mbps internet line. Therefore I need a new router with Gigabit ethernet. Also I&#039;d like to have a USB slot for storage in it.</p><p>I&#039;d also like to stay with Cisco Linksys. Do you have any suggestions? </p><p>I was looking at the WRT160NL which has an acceptable price of 70â‚¬ and seems to run with backfire.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>just figured out that the WRT160NL does not have GigE. Instead it looks like the DIR 825 from D-Link is quite ok.</p>									</div>

					<p>Have a look at the buyer&#039;s guide:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/toh/buyerguide">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/toh/buyerguide</a></p><br /><p>I am planing to make some wiki pages for the different CPUs (called cores), but this is going to take some time. The different between CPUs can be as huge as the difference between the AMD AthlonXP and Athlon64, or the intel Netburst and the Intel Core2. But it is a bit tedious to collect all the Information.</p><p>Also, we are searching for ways to make the Table of Hardware let you choose between multiple features and present you the devices. As of now, you have to work with &lt;Crtl&gt;+&lt;F&gt; to accomplish that. So many routers aren&#039;t supported at the present time, it won&#039;t take you long.</p><p>Also I do not see the point in asking here, because not many people own different devices, so they cannot really compare them.</p>									</div>

So I think it is very important for other users, if there are problems with the v2 version and we have to figure out which one (firmware) is effected or everything is ok (and hopefully it was just a little user clitch) ... because 3700/v2 with 16/64 and 2,4/5,0 is the way i would suggest to go ... <br />best c.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>meta96</strong> on 13 Jan 2011, 20:56)</p>

					<p>Well renaming didn&#039;t do it for him, he still has some issues (TFTP not working either). I&#039;m curious what&#039;s in that box.</p>									</div>
