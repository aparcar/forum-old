					<p>Hi, I just installed openwrt to my router. I&#039;m currently trying to harden it and I&#039;ve a few questions:</p><p>1. How do you change the default IP address?<br />2. How do you disable wireless admin access? WAN access?<br />3. How do you install a guess network?</p><p>Also, we&#039;ve got a persistent hacker on our neighborhood consistently wrecking havoc on the network, it&#039;s the whole reason I switched to openwrt, any tips how to secure the router?</p><p>Thanks in advance for the help.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>teoffyfy</strong> on 20 Jan 2017, 03:26)</p>

					<p>1.&nbsp; In the network page, interfaces, lan.<br />2.&nbsp; All incoming connections from the WAN are blocked by default.&nbsp; <br />You could block access to the web page by wireless by making two LANs (e.g. a guest network), but then your wired and wireless devices wouldn&#039;t be in the same network for sharing printers etc.<br />You can also disable the web page entirely and administer by ssh.&nbsp; If you use public-private keys on ssh it is almost unhackable.&nbsp; Only your machines that have a copy of the private key could get in.<br />3.&nbsp; Check the wiki.</p>									</div>
