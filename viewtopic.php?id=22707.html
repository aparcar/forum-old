					<p>I have flashed the picostation 2 with the actual trunk revision. Sometimes, I&#039;m getting stuck beacon messages that do not stop, ~2-3 per second. The AP isn&#039;t visiible if scanned from outside if that happens. I&#039;m using the default wlan configuration, with &quot;disabled&quot; commented out. I made a very interesting observation. Whenever I do a &quot;iwlist scan&quot; on the picostation, the channel is changed randomly, and whenever channel 6 is chosen, the stuck beacon messages appear. I have tried this on three different picostations, even with different revisions, the stuck beacons only appear when channel 6 was chosen. I have made a lot of trials, the problem never appeared on other channels.</p><p>Jan&nbsp; 1 06:52:58 OpenWrt user.err kernel: wifi0: ath_bstuck_tasklet: Stuck beacon; resetting (beacon miss count: 11)<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 06:52:58 OpenWrt user.err kernel: wifi0: ath_bstuck_tasklet: Stuck beacon; resetting (beacon miss count: 11)<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 06:52:59 OpenWrt user.err kernel: wifi0: ath_bstuck_tasklet: Stuck beacon; resetting (beacon miss count: 11)<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 06:52:59 OpenWrt user.err kernel: wifi0: ath_bstuck_tasklet: Stuck beacon; resetting (beacon miss count: 11)<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 06:53:00 OpenWrt user.err kernel: wifi0: ath_bstuck_tasklet: Stuck beacon; resetting (beacon miss count: 11)<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 06:53:00 OpenWrt user.err kernel: wifi0: ath_bstuck_tasklet: Stuck beacon; resetting (beacon miss count: 11)</p><p>The problem can be reproduced easily by issuing &quot;iwlist scan&quot; until the messages appear. Sometimes it needs a lot of trials until channel 6 is choosen.</p><p>-Erwin</p>									</div>
