					<p>Hey everyone,</p><p>I was initially working on a VPN solution to my remote access issue, but I think SSH tunneling will be more simple to implement and get me exactly what I want, I just have a few questions. First, my applciation:</p><p>I have an OpenWrt router (not my main router, simply a OpenWrt box that is on my home network) that I want to use as my &quot;remote access&quot; device. My initial goal is to use SSH Tunneling to remotely access my network. For example, I can go to my (main) router&#039;s homepage from a remote location, simply from my web browser. However, I am not sure as to what SSH commands I need to run, and from where.</p><p>I can remotely execute SSH scripts from the Linux router. So creating tunnels at the remote location is not an issue. So, I can create a tunnel from a remote location to my local machine, but where do I go from there to access other parts of my network?</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>supergeen</strong> on 29 Mar 2017, 01:28)</p>
