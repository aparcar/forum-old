					<p>Right now I&#039;m using an old alcatel speed touch pro modem/router, a switch and an old wl-700 dlink 11mb access point. Now it&#039;s time to upgrade so I&#039;m planning to buy a wl-500gp, install openwrt and use the alcatel as an adsl modem. I just need some advice before proceeding.<br />My needs are:<br />- a decent and stable router<br />- qos<br />- a couple of lan clients<br />- 54mb wireless with wpa for a couple of clients<br />all the extra features (fileserver for one) are welcome but not necessary.</p><p>I&#039;m not a linux newbie but I would like a stable hassle-free setup. I&#039;ve tried whiterussian on a wrt54gl borrowed from a friend. I didn&#039;t use it in production (no ppp nor wireless). I just played a little with ipkg and x-wrt. Installation was super easy.<br />I&#039;m buying a wl-500gp because of its better features (more ram and usb). Just a few questions:<br />Is wl-500gp as stable as wrt54lg?<br />Are there some known stability features, expecially regarding wireless?<br />Is kamikaze stable enough or should I use whiterussian?<br />Thanks!<br />leonardo</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenWrt Kamikaze does have problems with pptp &quot;dial in&quot; (and maybe other variants with ppp - search the forum), if your provider requires it, configure your modem to connect or stay with white russian.<br />There are several how to&#039;s for using the speedtouch as a router.</p>									</div>

					<p>I need pppoe for my provider. Is this buggy with kamikaze?<br />Does the pptp bug affect wrt54gl too? If not I could prefer it to the asus or I could stuck with whiterussian.<br />As for the speedtouch its a home model (modem only) upgraded via firmware to pro and already used as a router.<br />Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>If your speedtouch connects via pppoe to your provider, you don&#039;t need pppoe on the openwrt device. <br />Those bugs are device independent, I had problems on an Asus WL-500gd, and let the speedtouch 510i handling the connection for a few days. No more problems since then.</p><p><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=12811">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=12811</a></p>									</div>
