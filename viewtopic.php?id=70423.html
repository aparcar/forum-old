					<p>Just in case anyone else is looking for a solution to a similar problem, I was able to resolve this.&nbsp; I needed to edit the &quot;/etc/dnsmasq.conf&quot; by adding some dns servers.&nbsp; I chose to use Google&#039;s public servers. The edit I made is as follows:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>server=8.8.8.8
server=8.8.4.4</code></pre></div><p> </p><p>Also, if anybody has any comment/critiques of this solution please let me know.&nbsp; </p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
