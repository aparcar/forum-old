					<p>I&#039;m wondering if anyone has/knows of a router that&#039;s cheaper then the NEXX MT3020 with the same functionality.</p><p>Price to beat is $15 (that&#039;s what I paid for the thing)</p><p>Reason for looking for an alternative is that NEXX violates the GPL of the uboot. (they are not sharing their sourcecode) </p><p>the basics:<br />2x WIFI transmitter (from the looks of it it also does 5GHz?)<br />2x LAN.<br />1xUSB<br />Uses only 5V 300mA (1.5Watt)<br />Has 4 available GPIO&#039;s<br />8MB ROM<br />64MB RAM</p><p>Preferred alternative would have the same connectivity.<br />But would have the Atheros brains and a honorable and trustworthy uboot.<br />The price would be about the same (Max $20 so that there is a low risk in case of bricking, or loosing it in the concrete jungle)&nbsp; So ultimately it will be cheaper then $15. </p><p>I think it should be possible to find Atheros based hardware at this price. As they produce chips in the same quantities as mediatek.</p><p>I came across several atheros based devices like the TP-link 3020, but that one only has 1 LAN.</p><p>Note that this post is more specific then merely finding the cheapest hardware. I found even cheaper stuff (below $10) But not with the comparable hardware.</p><p>I&#039;m curious is anyone has come across something that can make the NEXX obsolete. <br />I hope NEXX will realese the sourcecode of their changes to uboot, but it doesn&#039;t seem to be happening so i&#039;m reluctant to use the NEXX hardware for anything that&#039;s connected to the web. It feels a bit like a windows box... You don&#039;t know if anyone else is browsing trough your data or using your hardware for doing something else.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ll have a look at the gl-inet, 16MB ROM sounds huge.<br />For me an external antenna is not a must,&nbsp; But yes it is a nice extra.&nbsp; </p><p>The NEXX has 2 PCB antenna&#039;s <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/_media/media/nexx/nexx.wt3020a.top.board.jpg">http://wiki.openwrt.org/_media/media/ne â€¦ .board.jpg</a><br />The 5GHz was indeed a mistake of me. At least I can&#039;t figure out why I have a memory about a 5GHz signal. <br />A few days ago scanned RF with an android app and i&#039;m sure a 5GHz signal was present, but that was when the original firmware was still on it. ... I&#039;m really confused at this point, I can&#039;t imagine the NEXX to have 5GHz, but then why is 5GHz in my memory. Oh well... I have been doing to many things at once. </p><p>The marginal info on Chinese sites is not the best marketing hehe.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure they would sell more to people like us when their info would have been more complete. And even more when they would honourably respect the GPL. (I hope the NEXX marketeers read along HINT HINT...)&nbsp; I do like the NEXX but I will not buy another untill they release the sourcecode, and I also advice others not to buy the NEXX at this point in time. Unless they are absolutely sure it will not be connected to the web.&nbsp; TP-Link and D-Link (both Chinese) they release the source code, so NEXX could do the same... The fact that they don&#039;t is enough to be alert.&nbsp; Not saying that it&#039;s their intention, but we can&#039;t be sure without the sourcecode. (So why are people still trusting Microsoft????)</p><p>Ok, I&#039;m going off-topic on my own topic HAHA</p><p>Thanks for those FCC links BTW!&nbsp; Those PCB pictures can be helpful to identify the chips.&nbsp; Would it be an idea to add these links to the wiki?</p><p>I just have ordered a D-Link DIR-505 for about $17 but that only has one RJ-45</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>frietpan</strong> on 22 Jul 2015, 23:47)</p>

					<p>Can you please explain what the issue is with u-boot.? </p><p>I understand there is issue with the GPL, but not clear if this is a technical issue in that it somehow limits the ability to upgrade or use with OpenWRT or if, as you imply, there is a security&nbsp; or just moral issue with this product.&nbsp; </p><p>Thanks&nbsp; RangerZ</p>									</div>

					<p>NEXX made changes to their uboot, and that seems to have some security issues.<br />AND NEXX does violate the GPL because they don&#039;t share the sourcecode of the changes they made to the uboot</p><p>what the exact security flaw is, that is not clear to me.<br />there is also an alternative uboot but that one is in chinese or another language, and also no sourcecode available.&nbsp; And maybe there is no security issue at all but without a source nobody knows.&nbsp; So all in all that IS a security issue, when you don&#039;t have a way to verify if it is secure.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And only when the security is breached then you might be able to find the issue.&nbsp; Please correct me when I&#039;m wrong I&#039;m no security specialist but this is how I understand the issue.</p><p>And to be honest the Moral issue is to me a bigger issue then merely a security flaw.&nbsp; When you have the means to fix a security flaw then the flat is just a minor issue. When a moral issue disables you to be able to fix a flaw, then you have a big problem, you will be at the mercy of the control freak who violated the Licence</p><p>But you are free to live with the illusion that it is secure if that&#039;s what you want.</p><p>I&#039;m still using the NEXX, but I will not connect it to the web. it will become a neighborhood bookshelf or something like that. a rogue AccessPoint with 6 GB of old books (very old books)</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah you need to have a little bit of luck to find a shop where it is on sale. </p><p>At the time that I ordered it&nbsp; it was $15. <br />Just be a bit carefull from who you buy it, cheap shipping always a bit risky.&nbsp; (and slow)</p><p>PS the 5GHz i&#039;m still confused about myself i think it was a mistake, but i&#039;m sure that the android app listed a channel in the 5GHz range when I was checking it (the original NEXX firmware then was still loaded)&nbsp; But my brain is also a bit buggy so i can be very wrong!</p><p>I know very little about uboot, i&#039;m all new to this, but from what i&#039;ve read then I prefer not to trust it.&nbsp; If you do trust it then thats ok for you. Still it is a big shame and not an honourable thing to brutally take the work of uboot and not share anything back. So just look for other brands that actually do play nice.&nbsp; If i had known about the GPL violation beforehand then i would simply not have bought it. And when they eventually realise that sharing the source it&#039;s better for them as well then all will be ok. </p><p>The guys from uboot chose GPL for a reason, and they share it for free, and the chinese may even make money off of it! But they just should share back... And there is nothing wrong with supporting the GPL.</p>									</div>
