					<p>Since we need some more (Wifi)routers, I would like to know what hardware I should buy!<br />So far, I have been using mainly LinkSys WRT54G/GL/GS routers but would like to know what other and perhaps better products are recommended. <br />In general, I need something with Wifi, a couple (3-5) lan ports and maybe USB2.0. Price should be up to around 100euros. <br />The more Ram/Rom and CPU-power, the better...</p><p>So, I am keen to see what you use/prefer/recommend...</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>
