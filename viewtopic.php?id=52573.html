					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am tinkering with LuCI to add a new application to LuCI. Following the instructions in <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/luci">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/luci</a> I added the new application code, but it isn&#039;t added to the target neither menuconfig. The solution I&#039;ve found is to modify the file file/feeds/luci/contrib/package/luci/Makefile at the root openwrt build folder and define there my application.</p><p>Please, could you tell if there is another way to add custom applications to LuCI? I would like to add the custom application code into an external package.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>Are you trying to add something to the luci GUI that then runs an external application? What do you want to add?</p><p>I presume you have created a package and you want to either host it on a server or have openwrt host it so when an image is built it is easily integrated into the image?</p><p>I think you know more than what i do but i also think that Dairyman might be able to help you out.</p><p>All i have been doing is adding to the LUCI scripts to make them look a whole lot better and run using .CSS/HTML5/JAVA/JQUERY MOBILE which allows access via smartphones and best of all tablets. Its shrinks most things onto these devices.<br />I have been working on this for several months and its looking good.<br />I also run links to our website and a chat room from within the code.</p><p>Dairyman adds new applications to the code by writing Lua and Bash scripts and implementing this into the .htm files (he is the brains behind what we are doing).</p><p>If your interested here are some links:</p><p><a href="http://ofmodemsandmen.com/">http://ofmodemsandmen.com/</a></p><p>Here is my theme (a better looking luci) we can now flash the router with this theme added in scripts + extra files (basically it becomes part of the image and saves space).</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=716QNKbaR00">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=716QNKbaR00</a></p><p>Also i think another one of our Bright sparks wrote a little program to deal with quick implementation of packages into an image but Dairyman or Cobia would need to comment on that.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Straitvodka</strong> on 4 Sep 2014, 12:08)</p>

					<p>Do you mind sharing what your app does? </p><p>The problem i have found when just adding custom scripts on top of Luci is that it does not save it into the flash ram and therefore it adds it ontop of the Boostrap or Openwrt themes you already are running. This means that it is using a lot of extra space and will slow down your router and might stop you in your tracks with respect to developing the app any further.<br />A group of us on this forum:</p><p><a href="http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-replies.cfm?t=2294185&amp;p=40">http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-re … 5&amp;p=40</a></p><p>Have been writing custom pages for Luci and even introduced a new theme as i mentioned. We have been doing this for some time now and we can compile it into the main image.<br />I would have to wait and see if Cobia or Dairyman respond with regards to creating an external package but i think Cobia can do this.</p><p>Come over to the forum and ask a question there. The only reason i came on here was one of our regular users spotted what you were doing and thought that we might be able to help each other out/ collaborate.</p>									</div>
