					<p>Hi OpenWRT experts,</p><p>May I know what is the minimum requirement for RAM and Flash for OpenWRT? Browsing on the internet indicates that it is 4MB flash and 16MB RAM. May I know if this figure is correct? Is it possible to reduce it to 2MB Flash and 8MB RAM or even lower? I do know of routers which use 2MB Flash and 8MB RAM. But, I am not sure if this can be theoretically achieved by OpenWRT.</p>									</div>
