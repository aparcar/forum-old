					<p>Hi!<br />I have a WRT54G v2.2.</p><p>Yesterday, i have had a problem during the firmware flash with openwrt. I think the flash process has been imcomplete because it never ended up and know I have the following problems:</p><p>- No Web interface (Err 404)<br />- router answer to ping on 192.168.1.1<br />- router reachable trough telnet on 192.168.1.1<br />- it seems that somes files are missing: /www is empty. nvram is not available...</p><p>So i am a bit stucked... I can&#039;t use my router . So i tried a tftp firmware upgrade: I have not benn able to do it: with TFTP2.exe , i have now answer from the router on 192.168.1.1 (I have tried dozen of times...). (at the boot up, i have the following led sequence: Power led flashing for about 5 seconds, then, power led continues flashing and DMZ is on for about 5 seconds. Then DMZ is off, and power led is on. )<br />How can i flash the firmware directly from the command line on openwrt ? I have not the &quot;write&quot; command.</p><p>Thank you for your help !</p>									</div>

					<p>First of all NVRAM isn&#039;t of use on kamikaze. Everything is in the /etc/config/<br />Normally a webinterface isn&#039;t available. You need to install it! Or you flash your router with a X-WRT version</p>									</div>
