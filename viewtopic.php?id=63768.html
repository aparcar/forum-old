					<p>Hey everyone. I seem to be having some issues with my generic x86 build.&nbsp; I&#039;m running off the trunk, and built the source myself.&nbsp; So far I&#039;ve overcome the problems of SATA issues, incompatible drivers because of different motherboards, and various other issues.&nbsp; But now, I am completely stuck at this issue.&nbsp; Inside this old PC, I have a TP-Link WN851ND PCI Wireless card. I&#039;m trying to get it up and broadcasting and can&#039;t, for the life of me, get it working.&nbsp; I took a look inside the wireless profile and will post the config below.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried running through a few different (and very few) tutorials on trying to set this up, but it either forces me to reinstall my image, simply because everything breaks as soon as I try to edit anything.&nbsp; Below is the configs for wireless and network, any and all help would be appreciated!</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-device &#039;radio0&#039;

					<p>That&#039;s the thing, I was using luci at the time as well to figure some things out and it was giving me an unknown access point that always was disabled.</p><p>As for the PCI string, I&#039;m not entirely sure if it&#039;s right and not sure if I got any input from iw list last time I tried it... I have the ath9k packages all installed as well, and an additional Ethernet card plugged into the second PCI slot. </p><p>I&#039;ll check tomorrow when I have the machine again to see if iw list picks up the device, if not what should I do?</p>									</div>

					<p>hmmm</p><p>im not using the same wireless card as yours but what I done in my side to make my wireless card works is just install the necessary packages/drivers and then restart, after the restart, the wireless should work as expected and will appear in luci interface under wifi page which is not there when the card&#039;s driver/packages is not installed, I done no configuration except of enabling the interface and changing the wireless security setting.</p><p>using a openwrt x86 64bit build, on atom octacore processor @ 2.6ghz not sure about the exact model of my wireless card but it is a dual band wifi based on atheros chipset afaik.</p><p>ive done all this thing on luci since im not a fan of configuring in terminal.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>remlei</strong> on 29 Mar 2016, 16:44)</p>

Currently I don&#039;t have my PC right now, but will be working on this issue more tomorrow!
