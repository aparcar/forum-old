					<p>Hi!</p><p>Has anyone any idea how to apply an external antenna to this router,or boost up tx power just a little bit?As I read a lot of forums,I&#039;m not the only one who isn&#039;t pleased with the router&#039;s wireless coverage/range.It has some connectors on PCB,that is similar to U.FL.I&#039;m ready to solder,if I must,but it would be good to know where to connect wires.<br />I can&#039;t change tx power above 20dBm,even if I set regulatory domain to CA/US by recompiling firmware.Is it a general ath9k problem,or just related to this hardware?<br />Any idea would be helpful,I&#039;m slowly going crazy about this f..ing internal antenna thing....It would be a perfect hardware otherwise.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;d also be interested in this, I noticed those too. Not even sure what they&#039;re connected to really. There are two (if I remember correctly) and there are more internal antennas than that. I hope that I have the pigtails for this, because I&#039;m ready to ream some holes to put RP-TNC connectors on this puppy.</p>									</div>

					<p>There are four of these connectors,I think 2 for each chip and 4-4 internal antennas.In openwrt WNDR3700 wiki there&#039;s a picture of the device,I&#039;m now testing the following : soldered a pigtail to the connector closest to usb port,connected an 8 dBi TP-Link ant to the pigtail,applied a patch to mac80211,with that I can control antenna configuration through /proc.Signal is increased a bit,but it&#039;s still not what I expected.<br />Here is the link to the ticket,where I found the patch(999-ath9k-wndr3700-antennas.patch):<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/6533">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/6533</a><br />The other patch seems to be applied already.<br />Ticket is already open,so there&#039;s hope the someone who is smarter than me - It&#039;s not hard <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> - will solve this.<br />With echoing different values to antctl2g,signal strength is changing,I&#039;m trying to find the best config.Until now that&#039;s all I&#039;ve found out,no better solution.<br />I&#039;m sure the best solution would be one or more external antenna,we should find out where to connect these.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kj0</strong> on 28 Sep 2010, 09:02)</p>
