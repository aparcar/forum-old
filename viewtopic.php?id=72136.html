					<p>Yes this is called a routed client.</p><p>Install OpenWrt.<br />(Network -- Interface (lan) Change the LAN IP to 192.168.2.1.&nbsp; Reconnect your PC to the router with the new address.<br />(Network -- Wireless) Add a wifi client to connect to the other router.&nbsp; Enter the encryption settings and key.<br />(Network -- Interface (wan) -- Physical) Attach this client to the wan network.&nbsp; A wifi client cannot be in a bridge, so remove the Ethernet port from the wan network.</p><p>Of course you need adequate signal strength from the other router.</p><p>The DAP-1160 cannot run OpenWrt due to it having an unsupported Realtek CPU and only 16 MB RAM.&nbsp; You may be able to do client mode with its stock firmware.</p>									</div>
