					<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>I wonder if it would possible to exchange the Texas Instruments WiFi card&nbsp; with an Atheros or Broadcom based to gain a working WiFi AP on AR7 based Routers? Broadcom based MiniPCI cards are available at ~15-20 Euros everywhere, Atheros based maybe 20-25 Euros.</p><p>AFAIK the MiniPCI is connected via the TI VLYNQ Interface, so it&#039;s not &quot;native&quot; PCI.</p><br /><p>Regards,<br />Marcus</p><br /><p>P.S.: And well, how do I choose another WiFi card if I have choosen AR7 as target platform in the current trunk? The only possible WiFi card is Texas Instruments...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>yoless</strong> on 4 Sep 2008, 00:56)</p>

					<p>The ti card is not a minipci card and the slot is also not minipci. I have tried atheros cards which did not work. When I tried to find out why it did not work someone explained to me that the vlynq card would work in a minipci slot, but not the other way around.</p>									</div>

					<p>So the VLYNQ is not a bridge to PCI rather than a native interface which goes on a Minipci form factor Wifi card with additional VLYNQ pins?</p><p>Weird. But not good. I thought it would easier to get an Router/DSL-Modem/WiFi box up and running with OpenWRT. Maybe not an AR7 based one.</p>									</div>
