					<p>Hello, I downloaded from the Astoria the latest soruce code for the 904LTE.

At the end into the bin folder I found the img file (there was a lot of files).</p><p>Following the rescue procedure and TFTP I uploded the img and then, as soon as the router completed the update I restarted the router. The router automatically restarted few times and now I have a message on the LCD saying that the boot is not correct and that I can repeat the rescue procedure.</p><p>Any suggestion on this? Are you aware about parameters that need to be enable or disable into the make configuration procedure??</p><p>Thank you very much for the information you would like to share.</p><p>I will continue my investigation and in case of any update I will post the results here.</p><p>Lorenzo</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bubusoft</strong> on 15 Aug 2014, 12:35)</p>

					<p>I haven&#039;t any details because the build always fails on my site. So I can&#039;t compare. But take the fullimage and unpack it. Then compare with your squashfs.<br />I think the best way is to use the fullimage, unpack it, make your changes, pack it into a new squashfs and merge it into the old fullimage. Then transfer the new image to the box. This is the workflow which works on my site.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>BigDee</strong> on 28 Aug 2014, 13:22)</p>

					<p>firmware-mod-kit is also using binwalk to identify the individual portions of the firmware.</p><p>To extract the rootfs FMK is fine. The problem is the structure of the firmware which consist of the rootfs + signature and the kernel + signature. Afaik the FMK is not able to handle that properly, so I have split the firmware after the uImage, keeping the rest (signature + kernel + signature) in a separate file and only processing the uImage with FMK. Do my changes and create a new &quot;firmware&quot; with FMK. Then afterwards I attach the rest file to new firmware.<br />This firmware is flashable (no complain during TFTP), but the rootfs signature is for sure invalid. I assume BigDee has done something similar.</p><p>My device is currently bricked, I&#039;m not able to recover it, flashing any (even official) firmware via the TFTP method.

					<p>Hello @all!<br />I&#039;m new to OpenWrt and my linux experiences is more like a power user willing to experiment a little. With a little pain I managed to compile OpenWrt 904lte specific with the sources uwehermann supplied (<a href="https://github.com/uwehermann/easybox-904-xdsl-firmware">https://github.com/uwehermann/easybox-904-xdsl-firmware</a>). The compilation process ended up without any errors.<br />Here&#039;s the problem I ran into: After compilation I have a new folder &quot;bin&quot; in the folder I was running the build/make. There are three files (md5sums, openwrt-ltqcpe-squashfs.image, openwrt-ltqcpe-ulmage) and two folders (packages, platform_vr9) and an archive (kernel-debug.tar.bz2). Within &quot;platform_vr9&quot; I have a file named &quot;fullimage.bin&quot; with 10.3 MB. I used this file for the recovery procedure running a TFTP Server on my Mac (192.168.2.100) and attached the 904lte directly via an ethernet cable. I held the reset button for more than 5 secs after poweron and the box came up with the message regarding the recovery mode. After a blink of an eye it said that the fullimage.bin was downloaded and that I should poweroff to restart. Now it&#039;s caught in a boot loop. Bricked, grrr…<br />So, what did I do wrong? I tried to use &quot;UEfullimage_AT904L-03.07.01.08.bin&quot; (latest firmware from vodafone) renamed to &quot;fullimage.bin&quot; but the box wouldn&#039;t use this stating it&#039;s the wrong type of image.<br />Any hints are highly appreciated. Have I used the right file? Do I need to process the compilation output any further to have a correct &quot;fullimage.bin&quot;? Many, many thanks in advance!</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry, I did not read all posts before writing this post, so I might repeat something, but here we go</p><br /><p>The provided source is based on backfire openwrt. Since then, some tools have changed which causes the archive to be impossible to build. On an older system however, it builds just fine. I tried building all released source files, all of them failed to boot in the way described by chipmunk.</p><p>Then, I tried to integrate the changes made back into a fresh checkout of the backfire branch. Especially tricky is the fact that they use an external kernel tree and additionally provide some patches, which do not cover all changes made to the kernel.<br />Right now, I already have a booting kernel, but no periphery at all works, not even a link on the ethernet ports.</p><br /><p>About the bootloader:<br />The password entered is compared to a SHA1 hash. However, the input to the hash function is always 16 Bytes. If the password has less then 16 Bytes, it is padded with \0 bytes. This will make it impossible to find the hash in any common rainbow table.</p><p>I also dumped the bootloader partition and tried to see if the source provided matches the actual code on the device. Part of the bootloader in compressed by LZMA but binwalk extracts that part just fine. While the binary &quot;u-boot&quot; contains the bytes in the sourcecode, the dumped binary does not contain it. I therefore think, that the actual hash is not the same as in the released source.</p>									</div>

					<p>Oh i see you have already posted an bootlog it seems that the Image you have flashed had disabled the output for the kernel messages to the console.<br />How have you created the image ? Have you added a script at the autorun which enables the serial output ?<br />I modified the bootloader of the Easybox 904 so that it allows to access it with any password. I flashed it and it works without a Problem <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Have somebody created an Image from the GPL Sources that have drivers for the LAN or WLAN interfaces ?</p><p>Best regards</p>									</div>
