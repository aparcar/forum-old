					<p>I have been running OpenWRT flavors since day 1 on a WRT54G.&nbsp; I finally updated my very old white russian build to OpenWRT backfire.&nbsp; So far it has been very smooth and after a dozen plus reboots of the router everything is still running perfectly.</p><p>The major problem I&#039;ve hit head first is the firewall setup.&nbsp; I have a webserver running at 192.168.1.106.&nbsp; Port 80 is forwarded.&nbsp; External users can access it via my world ip address and domain name.&nbsp; Internal users (so computers behind the router) cannot.&nbsp; My solutions to this problem on the old build do not work.</p><p>nmap on my world ip from a box external to me shows port 80 is open.</p><p>nmap on my world ip from a box internal to me shows port 80 is closed.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried to solve this on my own reading all the documentation I can and googling.&nbsp; I have come up empty.</p><p>Any advice?&nbsp; What changes do I have to make to /etc/config/firewall?&nbsp; An example forwarding port 80 in such a way that outside can access it and inside can access it both by the world ip.</p>									</div>
