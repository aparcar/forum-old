					<p>Hi all,<br />please bear with me, I am new to all this.<br />The hardware side of this is well documented on the net, and I have completed this.<br />My hardware is 3.3v so I understand it is ok to direct connect without the need for 5v max232.<br />I have installed the White Russian interface for this router, it completed successfully.<br />I can&#039;t find any reference to serial ports in the Open WRT Administrative Console.<br />Do the serial ports need initialising from a &quot;script&quot; during the router bootup?<br />Is this done with a program like PuTTY?<br />If so - how? step by step please<br />I have used PuTTY to log into the router, but thats as far as I have got. <br />Thanks in anticipation,<br />cheers,<br />David</p>									</div>

					<p>According to the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt54g#serial.port">wiki</a>, the first serial port is always enabled by default, so you can connect with the terminal program of your choice right away. The connection settings are also mentioned in the wiki.<br />If you are doing this for the first time, better double check that you have the right serial cable. It has to operate at 3.3V. Make sure to read <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/port.serial">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/port.serial</a> before starting.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, so you want to use the serial port of your WRT54GS as a virtual serial port of your PC? You probably need to install ser2net or serialoverip.<br /><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ser2net/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/ser2net/</a><br /><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/serialoverip/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/serialoverip/</a></p>									</div>
