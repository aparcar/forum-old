					<p>Here&#039;s what I get from Binwalk:<br />155672&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0x26018&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 65536 bytes, uncompressed size: 298576 bytes<br />234067&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0x39253&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;TRX firmware header, little endian, image size: 1724416 bytes, CRC32: 0xB101D87D, flags: 0x0, version: 1, header size: 28 bytes, loader offset: 0x1C, linux kernel offset: 0x0, rootfs offset: 0x0<br />234095&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0x3926F&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 65536 bytes, uncompressed size: 4233472 bytes<br />1958484&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0x1DE254&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Squashfs filesystem, little endian, version 4.0, compression:xz, size: 8811412 bytes, 818 inodes, blocksize: 131072 bytes, created: 2016-04-29 11:22:14</p><p>My question is - can I simply &#039;mksquashfs&#039;- and dd the first three items, and then append the squashfs partition at the end, or does something need to happen in the offset at 234095.</p><p>I think I can simply replace that squashfs part, but I worry there&#039;s a size or similar defined in the LZMA, or, the LZMA contains data relevant to the squashfs system...</p><p>Are they related, or am I right to simply go ahead and put the new squashfs in place of the old and then load it up?</p>									</div>
