					<p>Snapshots are, by meaning of their name, quick temporary full builds against the SVN trunk. No archives are kept, and they are intended for testing. They can be used for operational systems, but if you ever have a possibility of needing to install additional packages, especially libc, kernel modules, etc. you should create a full local mirror of the arch snapshot that you want to use and keep it. Any given day the kernel version referenced in trunk may change and break module compatibility.</p><p>That said, you can technically run with a snapshots opkg source, and update it as things go, but you need to make sure to only upgrade non-dependent packages (no kmod, etc.). Keep in mind that this is going even further off the supported path, so tread carefully.</p>									</div>

					<p>thanks, I was afraid of, I was very smart not to make a copy of the packages.</p><p>At this point I would like to ask you something: if snaphot are temporary build, is there also a stable build maintained&nbsp; over time?</p>									</div>
