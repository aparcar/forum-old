What I did was:</p><p>-take a thin cable (must be drilled). <br/>-undrill it and use only one single wire. Keep this wire attached to the cable. <br/>-put some solder on it. <br/>-add a little extra solder on the pads to bridge (not too much).<br/>-take the cable (you can use an angle of about 120Â°) and hold the single wire onto the bridge. Take your heated iron and put it in the middle on the wire (1-2 sec). Then simply cut the connection to the main cable. Ready...</p><p>If you can&#039;t solder decently anymore because of molten/burned board material in the way, carefully remove the dirt with a screwdriver. Looks like new after it...</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>BTW, this and several other reasons (such as u-boot mods, shared Ethernet interface for LAN and WAN) are why I put TP-Link near bottom of recommended AP81 routers.&nbsp; The good news is that they have excellent worldwide distribution... so worth the effort.</p></blockquote></div><p>I agree with you. I&#039;d like to use the planex, but it is not availible in DE. On the other hand the TP-Link costs only 37,99â‚¬ here (thats extremly cheap for a 3x3 mimo with detachable antennas). And maybe we can figure out the USB stuff. DATA connection is ready, there is only the problem of powering the port...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>prisma</strong> on 8 Mar 2009, 16:18)</p>

Of course you can.<br/>2. Yes, you can.<br/>3. wr941nd doesn&#039;t have USB port. To use USB port, some hardware hacking must be done. Till now, no one has used USB port on it.</p><p>If you don&#039;t want to be involved in hacking, hold on. Current port is not finished work.</p></blockquote></div><p>Thanks for the reply</p><p>I have read that you tryed some usb modules with original sdk with some sucess and i think its easy as solder a usb port on, but reading your posts again i see that the board seems don&#039;t have a 12v to 5v dc-dc conv, so if i plug a external hd with its own power suplly it will work ?</p></blockquote></div><p>That may work, but I am not sure.&nbsp; USB has some power/current requirement upon plug in and initialization. I didn&#039;t have enough time to read specification carefully, so in theory I am not sure. My mobile harddisk has only PS2 power cord and all my computers don&#039;t have PS2 port, so I can&#039;t try it myself at this time.</p><p>Maybe RoundSparrow can have a test <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile"/></p></blockquote></div><p>I flashed my wr941nd now and ath9k says hal status -22. (i used binutils 2.19.1 and gcc 4.3.3)<br/>I want to back to original, the command line is &#039;mtd -r write wr941n_en_3_4_5_up(081110).bin firmware&#039; ? and for openwrt upgrade i use the same line ?<br/>IÂ´ll make another openwrt with usb to try later, i have a usb hd with aux usb conector, in the packages repository donÂ´t have kmod-usb.</p><p>My very thanks for all the attention.</p>									</div>

					<p>Another finding is, although we think WR941ND uses only one ethernet port of CPU to connect switch chip, the other ethernet port is also connected.</p><p>Near cpu north-east corner, R499, R501-R507 (total 8 pins) are missing.
