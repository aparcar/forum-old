					<p>Hello.<br />I&#039;m not sure if I am allowed to ask you guys for help on buying a router compatible with OpenWRT.<br />Nevertheless I&#039;ll leave my question here.<br />I have a Thomson TG-784n in the living room supplied by my ISP.<br />It seems I will never be able to ditch it because:<br />a) I am contractually forced to use it<br />b) it provides IMS (VoIP) support to get a phone landline through the internet and I guess not many routers out there have IMS support, right?</p><p>The TG-784n is not a very bad router but it is far from being my 1st choice due to it&#039;s wifi poor coverage and due to it&#039;s LAN ports being only 10/100. My ISP won&#039;t provide another router model of my liking.</p><p>So, I am looking for a router with the following requisites:<br />- Easily compatible with OpenWRT stable.<br />- 5 LAN ports 10/100/1000<br />- good wired throughput (it will be used for IPTV streaming)<br />- Wifi N (at least 300Mbps) <span class="bbu">if possible dual channel</span> (a/b/g/N)<br />- VLAN support would be very welcome<br />- PoE would be a killer but not required (due to it&#039;s install location)<br />- being easily available on the internet (ebay/amazon) shipping from EEC to avoid customs issues<br />- I have a low budget. My target is below 100€ but let me know if there&#039;s something a bit above 100€ that might interest me.</p><p>All help will be greatly appreciated.<br />Cheers</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi robthebrew.<br />Thanks for your reply.<br />I had already browsed the links you gave me.<br />The 1st one is very generic. Talks about the kind of hardware that is supported by OpenWRT.<br />The 2nd is a comprehensive list of brands/models of routers that are supported by OpenWRT.<br />Actually the 2nd list should be enough for me but it has too much information. There are so many brands and models in it that I can&#039;t make up my mind.<br />Besides, some entries in it are not very clear to me.<br />For instance, TP-Link is quite popular where I live. They have a the TL-WR1043ND which is on the ToH. But when I open the ToH for this router I see that the product has many versions from V1.1 to V1.10.<br />But then in that article I can read that it can brick and that it has issues with the WAN port, etc.<br />I understand that there is no perfect router but maybe you can point me a few models.<br />So, anyone knows a router similar to this TL-WR1043ND but which is easier to install OpenWRT on it, and which won&#039;t brick easily and won&#039;t have issues with the WAN port?<br />Thanks in advance.<br />Cheers</p>									</div>

					<p>The 1043 is a nice router. As to bricking: anyone can brick any router given enough ineptitude and lack of reading!<br />If I were in your position, I would narrow down the field first by the most taxing requirements:<br />5 Gb ports,<br />then<br />wireless N<br />then PoE (though that might limit the list a lot!)<br />Then see if you can find the router on ebay etc, then do a final check to see if it is in the supported list.<br />I know nothing about IMS, so your best bet is searching this and voip in the forum/wiki. My bet is that there is something in openWRT that will help, but as I said, I don&#039;t know.</p>									</div>
