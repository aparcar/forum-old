					<p>Hi all!</p><p>I have a Linksys WRT54G v5.1 wireless router. I had some issues the other day about PCs in the house not being able to convert the text based web address to the number based ip-address (or that&#039;s how I got it) and my ISP believes it was the issue of my router. I reset the router to the factory setting and everything seems to be okay right now, but it started me thinking that the issue might reoccur. The best shot I thought to giving it, was to find the latest firmware and then if the issue comes back, upgrading my router to see if that fixes it. However, Linksys only has firmware for 5.0 hardware on its website, not for 5.1, and googling around brought me here.</p><p>However, 5.1 isn&#039;t listed in the compability list either. Any suggestions what I should do?</p><p>Thanks! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>The WRT54G v5+ only has 2 MB flash, which isn&#039;t enough for OpenWrt.&nbsp; However, DD-WRT has a &quot;micro&quot; version which fits on 2 MB flash... I would go with that.&nbsp; I have a WRT54G v6 running DD-WRT micro, which works much better than the factory firmware.</p><p>Better yet, get a new router (Netgear WNDR3700, D-link DIR-825, or TP-Link TL-WR1043ND) and put OpenWrt on it!</p>									</div>
