					<p>Did so, looks like the ath10k module is broken as of late. It was erroring out while trying to use the firmware (which I had to manually scp). I&#039;d paste logs, but reverting to an older version of openwrt bricked the router. I guess I have one of the newer, unsupported chipsets that necessitated running trunk.</p><p>Ugh.
