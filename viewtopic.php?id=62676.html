					<p>My ISP speeds can fluctuate a lot, so standard QOS is not really useful for me. Setting the upload and download speeds to worst case scenario&#039;s results will cause my speeds to suffer during the rest of the day. Setting them too high will cause QOS not to work during lower speeds on the ISP side.</p><p>Gargoyle has this amazing thing called &quot;Active Congestion Control&quot; (ACC) which decides which upload/download speeds to use automatically based on your current ping. Does anyone know whether such a thing also exists for openwrt? Or whether I can use ACC on openwrt, since Gargoyle is based on openwrt?</p><p>I&#039;d rather stick with openwrt because of the more advanced options and stuff that it offers, but I would really like to use the QOS software from Gargoyle.</p><p>Thank you very much in advance for the information <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

I believe gargoyle does track the downstream bandwidth only. The experimental qdisc cake also promises to allow automatic shaper adjustment on the downstream, but cake is only included in a few community builds. I believe hnyman&#039;s build to be the one with the most recent cake (which can partly be controlled from sqm-scripts and luci-app-sqm. See <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=28392">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=28392</a> for his build, but be aware that it only targets a few router models. Arokh targets a few more models and also includes cake, if I recall correctly, but I am uncertain which cake version is included, see <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=50914">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=50914</a></p><p>Good luck<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>
