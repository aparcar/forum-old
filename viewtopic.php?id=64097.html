					<p>hello<br />Is there any way to set up some qos mechanism to prioritize video streaming like youtube etc over downloads like steam games etc? they <strong>both work on popular ports like 80 (steam, some streaming services popular in my country) and 443 (in case youtube https)</strong> so I can&#039;t use them to differentiate in <strong>qos-scripts</strong>.<br /><strong>We have 8Mbit connection.</strong><br />I&#039;ve tried giving my <strong>TV&#039;s IP</strong> Express priority in <strong>qos-scripts</strong>, but to no avail, (steam) downloads always saturated out the connection and video streams started buffering (and my wife was complaining).<br /><strong>Wondershaper&#039;s</strong> magic also didn&#039;t help.<br />Tried <strong>SQM QoS</strong>, tried every qdisc and every queue setup script, even compiled <strong>cero&#039;s cake</strong> scheduler, also to no avail.</p><p>Every QoS mechanism seems to fight bufferbloat and high latency when using internet, but i want just high throughput of video streaming services over normal http downloads. Is there any `magic` able to differentiate those kinds of traffic so i can give them different priorities?</p><p>I tested simultaneously downloading steam game and (tried) viewing youtube 1080p 60fps video.</p><p>Seriously, I bought new, openwrt compatible router (old one broke too)) in hope I could normally download steam games without manually adjusting steam download speed, each time my wife would complain, her video streaming experience isn&#039;t quite satisfying</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>maniel</strong> on 10 Apr 2016, 17:34)</p>

					<p>Hi Maniel,</p><p>I believe your request to be a bit tricky, as the data packets seem to be quite similar. It is relatively easy to differentiate packets based on information in the header, but much harder to do so by content. But let&#039;s see how we can go with this. Are the machines used for steam and for video streaming separate? If yes we have a much better chance. Also what operating systems are you using on both machines? How are the dices connected to your router (wired or wlan/wifi)? The problem I suspect is that video &quot;streaming&quot; often does not really stream at the required bandwidth, but instead will try short periods of higher bandwidth downstream to fill a buffer and then will shut off for a while until the buffer is (almost empty) when it will repeat the procedure. So instead of nice continuous traffic streams close to the required bandwidth (for a given video quality) the &quot;streaming&quot; application will cycle between no traffic at all and as much bandwidth as available. Now your steam downloads will try to use all available bandwidth, but typically do this (assuming TCP streams here) in a fairly gentle fashion where they gradually increase the bandwidth until the fill the pipe. Now the video high bandwidth epochs will probably not play nice with this... Stream will throttle itself back (given enough time) but the cyclic ans transient nature of the video traffic will just not allow for a nice steady state equilibrium of stream ans steam traffic to develop. In all likelihood the video application will see its buffers to fill much slower than it wants and will hence require additional buffering (but given the sparsity of data this is just a wild theory)</p><p>A quick test you could to is to set in SQM-scripts the download/ingress bandwidth to half your real bandwidth; that should give SQM a better control over the traffic and might allow tighter temporal control of the steam flows.</p><p>If the IP address of the stream computer is fixed and known, we might be able to help things a bit by marking its traffic as background priority, but let&#039;s see...</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>

On the other hand separating different traffic flows that use the same port numbers is tricky. Either one knows which IP-ranges belong to which service (and keeps tracking changes over time in IP ranges) or one needs to look into the packets and perform deep packet inspection (DPI) but even that gets tricky if the to be differentiated flows use https for example. In short DPI will be a constants arms race, if tomato collects and distributes the required changes effectively and timely it might a a great solution for the OP.</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>

But most sqm-scripts actually allow to use DSCP marks in packets to sort data into three priority classes. So all we need to add are instructions to make sure packet to/from the steam machine are put either into the background class or that TV data is put into the elevated priority class; the idea being that they never share bandwidth. Now due to the bursty traffic of video &quot;streaming&quot; this might not work well enough out of the box, but it certainly is worth a try.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>maniel wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Also I noticed the best streaming performance with `pie` qdisc and hfsc_lite (?) script, with 1080p youtube and&nbsp; downloads on the same computer.

SQM-scripts tries to use the DSCP marks in the IP headers to sort packets into three different priority bands. That works reasonably well for outgoing or egress traffic, but for incoming traffic the DSCP marks are unreliable and mostly untrustworthy (your ISP might have set them to any value deemed useful for them, which is all fine with the definition of DSCPs they were never defined to be end-to-end). So for reliable incoming/ingress direction the qos system needs to be able to use the header information to figure out which DSCP mark to use on those packets and that can get a bit hairy. Let me elaborate, on the ingress interface the qos system sees the incoming packets on the outside of the network address engine, so there is not even easy to just separate packets by the IP addresses of the internal hosts (which should be the easiest way to differentiate between your TV and the win10 computer). It is possible to work around these challenges though, and I am willing to help you a bit, but most testing would be left to perform for you...<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>maniel wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Also i think DPI is a bit overkill for QoS within home network</p></blockquote></div><p>I agree partly, if there is a place whee DPI might be acceptable it is with in a home I believe, but even there the use is dubious. Also performing DPI is computationally expensive and might simply be too much for your router...</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>
