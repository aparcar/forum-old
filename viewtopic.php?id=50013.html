					<p>Hello,</p><p>I wanted to start work on d-link dhp-1565 which is a very interesting device. I opened it and I found a 4 pin non-populated connector, so I thought bingo!<br />With multimeter I measured GND and +3.3V, no problem with that, so I assumed other two pins are TX / RX but... they don&#039;t seem to be <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />I have a USD to TTL converter, and it has VCC and activity LEDs per cable, when I connect GND and TX and RX they all come up! So basically it looks like short <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> With multimeter I get ~400 ohms between those pins and GND...<br />I am sure I have VCC and GND correct, as when I connect them, router powers up via my USB port and actually boots...<br />With TX / RX and GND connected router won&#039;t power up (as there is some kind of short).<br />I don&#039;t see any other connector that could be it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>Anyone has any idea?</p><p>ps. I did use my USB to TTL converter before (on TP-link) and it was all ok...</p><p>ps2. I created w wiki page for this if anyone is interested: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dhp-1565">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dhp-1565</a></p>									</div>
