					<p>I cant recommend the WRT1900 device. It is based on closed source wifi parts and cant be run functional when using just free software.<br />He asked for &quot;low end&quot; with price as reason. Using ath9k based 1$ ebay router fits much better the requirements of the first post. For 120Euros he could buy about 125! single 1$ ath9k devices.<br />He also wrote &quot;office&quot;. Not &quot;gaming&quot; or something else where security maybe does not matter.<br />The security basics are not by accident <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_ … _obscurity</a> . Only when this point is checked and only free software is been used, only then the security can be authenticated and propperly reviewed.</p><p>In short again: Get a 1$ ath9k free-software-only based wifi device. Its more secure then some other devices that fails on security basics like the described one on wikipedia.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>xicoyihl</strong> on 10 Jan 2018, 22:15)</p>

					<p>I always used tplinks wr841n, they are cheap and work fine, as long as you can get V12 or lower version. Most recent V13 has unstable wifi in ap mode. So to be sure, I&#039;d go for tp link wr1043nd, which is still atheros (wr841n v13 is mediatek), has good community support and is stable. But it is quite expensive ($40 in here).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 13 Jan 2018, 01:02)</p>

					<p>I am pretty happy with my D-Link DIR-825, supports Dual Band and just about every 5 Ghz channel out there (about 50). Picked it up on a local used site for $20.</p>									</div>
