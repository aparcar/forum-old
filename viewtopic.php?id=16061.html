					<p>WRT600n does not have support, but has two radios which is very good for legacy (one on b,g and one on n) and having a 40MHz spectrum. It also has gigabit ethernet and a usb. However the support is currently non-existant for openwrt but is for dd-wrt. Once these come out for openwrt they&#039;ll be great, especially since they recently went down 80$ in price.</p><p>Second up is wrt350n which I believe has some limited support for openwrt. It has one radio and ... gigabit ethernet? I think so.</p>									</div>
