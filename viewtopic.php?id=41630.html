					<p>Had a 12.09-rc1. Was not pleased with lack of room and configuration options. Left lying for a month. When starting again, the router did not accept any connections. UDP listening brought me only &quot;Please&quot;, nothing more <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /> (may it was please end my misery). I was unable to ping router also after the boot. The status LED showed OK though.<br />Then stumbled upon: set ip address to 192.168.0.100 (or something in the same subnet) and do a tftp<br />(tftp -i 192.168.0.1 PUT firmware.bin). That method gave me timeout, but router started to ping after that and I was able to login to Luci.</p><p>Now I wanted to try something with most of stuff preinstalled. Downloaded TomatoUSB Shibby MOD<br />tomato-K26-1.28.RT-MIPSR1-104-Mini.trx<br />Started firmware upgrade, waited for 10 minutes for the process to end and restarted the router. And nothing.<br />Power led is ON, if I connect lan, then the designated port lights up, but the status led is OFF. No ping during or after the boot, UDP method(static ip, listen to UDP on port , ah yes, recvudp does not need parameters) is completely void of any messages.</p><p>My first question is:<br />1) Can I do anything before I get a serial output?<br />2) Is this device OK for getting serial output? =&gt; USB To RS232 TTL PL2303HX Auto Converter Module Converter Adapter 5V 3.3V Output<br />3) Could somebody post picture, what legs to short or in case this is very bad idea, post me an ebay jtag item name (USB?). Damn, I have to ask somebody to solder that jtag pins to place.</p><p>Any help appreciated, then again, if I get tired enough, I write this router off as a schooling expense <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>---<br />Update: found a note, to try 192.168.0.X and ping 192.169.0.1. Did it, found, that router is pinging and tried web interface.<br />Found some kind of failsafe web page, that urged me to upload firmware. Uploaded factory firmware<br />DIR-320A1_FW121WWb03.bin, and all is up and dandy.</p><p>What struct me strange:after restoring, the web interface password has outlived 2 openwrt flashes(backfire,attitude) and borked Tomato flash.</p><p>Just no idea, what is going on. The suitability of USB serial is still of interest to me, as I intend to do some kind of torrentbox from this router and I have no idea, where next exploits will take me.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sihker</strong> on 13 Jan 2013, 22:30)</p>
