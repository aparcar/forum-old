					<p>Hello. I&#039;m new here. Also i don&#039;t have much experience regarding flashing routers so I need yor help. I have tl-wr1043nd. I have flashed the original firmware through official tp-link firmware updater. New firmware I used is from here <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd?s">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd?s</a><br />Now I have no idea what to do because I cannot connect to my router and also to internet. At the moment I&#039;m trying to connect to the router first. I have it connected to my laptop through ethernet. All the leds ale flashing PWR SYS and LAN port (the one i connect to laptop). I have no idea what to do to make it work. I shouldn&#039;t have done it without any experience so could anyone please explain what to do to make it work?</p>									</div>

					<p>What firmware did you use? If it is a v1.x (router version is printed next to model# on the router), Attitude Adjustment 12.09 is what you wanted. v2.x Would be Barrier Breaker.<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd?s#downloads.for.tl-wr1043nd.v1.x">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl- â€¦ 043nd.v1.x</a></p><p>If typing your default gateway into your browser doesn&#039;t connect you to the LuCi interface, you should try using an SSH client to connect. <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">PuTTY</a> is a good option since it also supports Telnet (which is needed for booting in failsafe mode). From there, if you aren&#039;t familiar with a linux terminal environment, the OpenWRT wiki is your best friend. But if you are familiar with a linux terminal environment, then the OpenWRT wiki is your best friend. Still.</p><p>If neither method works, <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe">Failsafe mode</a> is probably your last option. <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=38513">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=38513</a> may be helpful.</p>									</div>

					<p>My version is v.1.x and this is the file I have used:</p><p>openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr1043nd-v1-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin</p><p>The point is I am not familiar with the console so probably I won&#039;t be able to do it this way. I have managed to run the router in fail safe mode but still i cannot connect to router. I didn&#039;t setup addresses first and I used defaults. Trying to connect to 192.168.1.1 doesn&#039;t do anything. Also I typed the addresses manually wit 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1 but it also didnt work. I am using straight cable not crossed one.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi. I would like to try and help you.<br />Before your router was broken, what are you running it with? tplink or openwrt?<br />And based on your last post, it seems that you are upgrading it from &quot;??&quot; using the openwrt upgrade file.<br />1) If you are upgrading it from openwrt to the latest one, was it a successful update?<br />Did you choose to &quot;keep setting&quot; when upgrading?<br />-If you choose to &quot;keep setting&quot;, then you should be able to at least connect to the internet. (But you can&#039;t access the web administration. You need to re-setup it again)<br />-If no, then you need to re-setup everything again.<br />2) If you are upgrading from tplink to openwrt using the upgrade file, then your router is potentially bricked. (Need someone to confirm this, as I have never done this way before.)</p>									</div>
