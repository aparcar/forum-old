					<p>Hey,</p><p>have followed the discussion in the Web-Devel wanted-Thread so far and evaluated the MBM proposal too.&nbsp; I think there is a minimal standard necessary to give ipk devels a guideline how to integrate their IPK in the web UI. Here is what I do presently (my stuff does not rely on third party packets, no php, no httpd-xxx, no libs just plain shell):</p><p>In /www and in /www/cgi-bin/ there are a lot of small files, e.g.:</p><p>/www/cgi-bin/11-password<br />/www/cgi-bin/22-password<br />/www/cgi-bin/33-system</p><p>These files hold HTML snippets to be integrated in a navigation bar, may be this way:</p><p>&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;password.html&quot;&gt;Change PW&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;</p><p>Every page (here password.html) integrates Navigation and Layout by ash script commands. In real life you will have to make a plain XHTML page without layout and replace the &lt;body&gt; tag with a &quot;/www/cgi-bin/pre.sh&quot; in the file header. The pre.sh will call this:</p><p>for inc in /www/cgi-bin/[0-9][0-9]-*;do cat $inc;done</p><p>A new IPK can add its own status page to /www and its own administration page in /www/cgi-bin. The new page is automatically integrated in the navigation and instantly visible afer &quot;ipkg install&quot;.</p><p>An IPK devel has to do 3 things:</p><p>a) Make a simple XHTML page for Administration of the IPK and maybe one for Status. No Layout.<br />b) Include the necessary ash-script-logic to make the config changes when the page is called with POST<br />c) Add those stuff together with the navbar snippets to his IPK.</p><p>Comments?</p>									</div>

					<p>I think this is a bit too simple.</p><p>My webif code is a lot more complex for several reasons:<br />- I want to move as much common code as possible into a single script that can be used from the modules<br />- Running an awk script is faster than using shell code to do processing, which involves several variable comparisons, etc. This is because busybox does a fork/exec on /bin/busybox every time the script calls echo, [], cat and other applets built into busybox.<br />- I want to make it as simple as possible to write the web interface modules. There&#039;s a lot of abstraction code in my webif, but if you try it, you will see that it still runs pretty fast.</p><p>As soon as I&#039;ve implemented more stuff (and added common code for input validation), I will document the &#039;API&#039; that my webif package provides, and I&#039;d like it to become the standard for OpenWrt packages.</p>									</div>

					<p>nbd is right about the speed of cgi pages when you only use shell script.&nbsp; The interfaces that I have run and tested that only use shell script load very slowly.&nbsp; I think this is a big deal.</p><p>The interface that nbd is doing (webif) is very fast.&nbsp; It has my vote.</p><p>I think that nbd&#039;s work would make a great standard.&nbsp; It seems very complete and you can tell that a lot of for thought has been put into the work.</p>									</div>

					<p>nbd, spence,</p><p>thanks for replying. I have a different opinion here - because I did not receive any complaints about speed, GUI refresh rates and the like in the last year. But a lot of complaints about not beeing ready, not offering specific settings or doing settings wrong or (last but not least) the windows like reboot-to-change-settings. I&#039;am KISS fanatic. But I may be able to adapt my HTML-&gt; ShellCGI converter to whatever the future provides here.</p><p>Just do it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> Sven-Ola</p>									</div>
