					<p>I have been reading through the topics for the last two hours now and I just don&#039;t get it.</p><p>Previously I have been using dd-wrt on a Linksys router. There were some simple port redirections when accessed from the internet, as an example 58080-&gt;8080 on a specific host in my LAN. Somehow a very typical setup.</p><p>Now I am using backfire and have created the same forwards. Works fine from the internet, but not when I access my public adress on port 58080. This connection will just get refused. This was working on dd-wrt.</p><p>I have been reading through some possible solutions but they were all limited and looked like a workaround to me.</p><p>Can anybody explain in a simple way why this behavious is different and cannot be achieved with 10.03 easily?<br />I guess, there are good (security?) reasons for this, but I just don&#039;t get it.</p><p>I am very thankful for some information here.</p><br /><p>Kind regards<br />Markus</p>									</div>

					<p>just posted a duplicate of this because i really didn&#039;t know what this issue is called i.e. &quot;nat loopback&quot;.</p><p>jow: i already have that exact file in 10.03.1-rc4, but nat loopback is not working for me ootb.</p><p>edit: have to take that back, nat loopback is working from lan zone, but not from dmz zone. is there anything specific i have to enable for it? does the hotplug script only setup lan zone by default?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lkraav</strong> on 25 Jan 2011, 02:06)</p>
