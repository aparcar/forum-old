					<p>Hi,<br />I hit this error:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Collected errors:
 * satisfy_dependencies_for: Cannot satisfy the following dependencies for openvpn-openssl:

First was when dealing with usb stuff.<br />As I understand it&#039;s something to do with dependencies on older kernel and basically I have to recompile the whole thing again with openssl included.<br />So, is there like a table of the packages that behave this way? Because I&#039;d like to know so I am not forced to compile again every time I decide to test/add some stuff. Right now opkg seems to work for light stuff like adding nano etc. For more powerful functions I get stuck with this kernel dependancy error.<br />Is there a list where I can find out what I have to compile, that I can&#039;t add in 15.05.1 later?<br />Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>There is no list. But the core rule is that <strong>all kernel packages (kmod-...) are dependent on the exact kernel options checksum hash at the kernel compilation time.</strong> Additionally, there may be some other kernel-dependent packages, but those are more rare. Typically you can install user-space packages (&quot;the light stuff&quot;, like nano) from the release repo.</p><p>--</p><p>Openwrt has strict kernel module checksum checks. It is not only about the kernel version itself, but also about the options used when compiling the kernel (and kmods).</p><p>In practice you need to install kernel modules (kmod-*) from the same build run that built the main firmware.</p><p>Either<br />- use an official release so that you can install kernel modules from the official repo<br />- use a third-party firmware and use kernel modules from his repo<br />- compile everything by yourself at the same time.</p><p>you may try --force-depends option in opkg (from console), but that is pure lottery especially if there is already 3.18.23-.44 difference between repo and the current sources.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 7 Nov 2016, 12:57)</p>

					<p>I compiled the new firmware, with openvpn-openssl added to it, but for testing purposes I tried after to install it, wanted to see that it&#039;s installed properly, and I again got the error:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OW:~# opkg install openvpn-openssl openvpn-easy-rsa
