					<p>It&#039;s my first time with openwrt. I read documentation, common errors and faqs. I stiil have a problem.<br />I own a WRT54GL, I installed openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin.<br />First of all I can telnet to 192.168.1.1 on a LAN port only if press reset to get into failsafe. I presume this is right<br />Then, with normal booting process It look like openwrt gets&nbsp; its address by the dhcp server on the lan.<br />In fact the only address I can ping is 192.168.178.22 on the WAN port.<br />But on that address telnet and ssh are refused as well as web browser access.<br />I&#039;m sure I&#039;m missing some point. Please help</p><p>Blasco</p>									</div>
