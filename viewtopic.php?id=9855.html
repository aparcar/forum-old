					<p>I&#039;ve tried out a lot with sablevm but all the time i m getting one of the two errors <br />1. Can&#039;t found sablevm<br />2. Can&#039;t create VM</p><p>when i explored I found that there were a few support files missing. I installed those also, but still no progress... I m getting the same errors. On further exploration i revieled that sablevm supports bash but not busybox.... whereas wrt54gl makes use of busybox....... Alas</p><p>Is anyone there who could guide me in running even a simple java application of printing &#039;Hello World&#039; on the wrt54gl router......... </p><p>Thanx and m Grateful for ur help in advance....</p>									</div>
