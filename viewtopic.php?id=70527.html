					<p>I have a basic openwrt installation working and set to send syslog events to my logging server. It all works fine but I am only seeing outbound traffic being logged, there is no inbound connections coming through.</p><p>Just wondering why this is? Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>When i go into a firewall zone there is a checkbox &#039;enable logging on this zone&#039;. Once I check that box, I can see the source and destination IP address and port details show up on the &#039;kernal log&#039; tab.</p><p>It&#039;s only showing one way traffic going out though, not going in.</p><p>It&#039;s a standard openwrt build, so what do you mean it does not log traffic by default?</p><p>THanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry, I did not remember about that option.</p><p>Now, according to the documentation (<a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/firewall#zones">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/firewall#zones</a>), that option only logs &quot;rejected and dropped traffic&quot; (and that is my experience, also); as there are no reject / drop rules on the LAN interface (unless you added some), I think it is normal that only (rejected or dropped) traffic coming through the external interface gets logged.</p>									</div>

					<p>The default configuration will reject almost all traffic incoming on the WAN.</p><p>Normal usage such as reading web pages is all &quot;outgoing&quot; connections.&nbsp; In other words an Internet server&#039;s response to an internal request is not considered &quot;incoming.&quot;</p>									</div>

					<p>OK thanks. I&#039;ll look for a 3rd party option. Only thing i can think of is snort, anyone have any other suggestions to log all packets coming in and going out the wan interface, regardless of drop/reject/accept?</p>									</div>
