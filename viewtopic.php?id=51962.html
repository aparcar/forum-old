					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am trying to get a Phidget servo controller to work with OpenWrt (12.09), either using SBC or the webservice.<br />(1066_1 - PhidgetAdvancedServo 1-Motor: <a href="http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?category=11&amp;product_id=1066_1)">http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?ca … id=1066_1)</a></p><p>When phidgetwebservice21 is running, it is listening on the port, as it should.<br />But the Phidget Control Panel cant find it...(using bonjour?)</p><p>I get these two errors when I start the phidgetwebservice21.<br />dlopen failed with error: File not found<br />Assuming that zeroconf is not supported on this machine.</p><p>Found some information about the errors..<br /><a href="http://www.phidgets.com/phorum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=4321">http://www.phidgets.com/phorum/viewtopi … amp;t=4321</a></p><p>So, it seem that I need Zeroconf/Bonjour running on the router?<br />but how can I check this?</p><p>Maybe Zeroconf need some configuration to know what to broadcast?<br />Well, I am lost.. </p><p>Anyone have this working or can give me a hint..</p><p>Cheers<br />-Anders</p>									</div>

					<p>After some struggle, I got it to work with the phidget-service and connecting directly to the ip and port using C# sample application from a remote PC.</p><p>But I had to downgrade to a older version of the Windows Driver.<br />Both 12.09 and 14.07 uses an older version (1.0.3) of the communication protocol, so you need Phidget Windows Driver from 2_1_6_20100126 to get anything to work.</p><p>I am about to download the buildroot and what version of Phidgets library it contains, so maybe I can compile a dist that uses a newer protocol.</p><br /><p>Cheers<br />-Anders</p>									</div>
