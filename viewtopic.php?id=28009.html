					<p>My configuration:</p><p>ASUS WL-500G Premium v1<br />minipci TP-Link TL-WN961N v1.2 (AR5416-AC1A)<br />Backfire SVN (rev 24824)</p><p>Wifi: 802.11ng, HT20, encryption: psk2 (tried also with &quot;none&quot;)</p><p>Sometimes, when wifi is enabled, the router reboots itself. </p><p>My only debug attempt was starting a remote ssh to the router and executing &quot;top&quot; and &quot;logread -f&quot;, but when the router reboots i loose the connection before it prints anything.. at the moment of the disconnection cpu and ram usage are normal.</p><p>I haven&#039;t a serial interface and I&#039;m looking for another way to debug it, someone talked me about netconsole, but I don&#039;t know how to enable it without recompiling kernel.</p><p>The reboots occurs only with some kind of data traffic, for example when I open from a ms-windows wifi client a samba share with many pictures from a wired server (I think this is because the client sends many concurrent requests to get the preview of any picture), sometime while playing videos from youtube.<br />With single-file HTTP/FTP transfer I do not have any problem,&nbsp; I can download a ~1GB file from a wired server via wifi client at about 3MB/s.</p><p>When the router is up the wifi link is always good and the client connects at 130Mbps without any problem.</p><p>When wifi is down I don&#039;t have any problem.</p><p>Think this could be related to: <br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=26012">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=26012</a><br />and ticket:<br />#7087</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lore20</strong> on 6 Jan 2011, 15:30)</p>
