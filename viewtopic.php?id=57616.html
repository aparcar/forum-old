					<p>I&#039;ve successfully flashed OpenWrt to several WD N600s but am having trouble making use of them.&nbsp; I have reviewed the documentation but found nothing that tells me what I need to know.&nbsp; My one success is configuring as an access point so that both wifi and lan talks to my lan, ignoring the wan port.&nbsp; One failure is configuring for use as the client side of a wifi bridge.&nbsp; I don&#039;t recall the details of that failure but I ended up using a Linksys flashed to dd-wrt.</p><p>My current project is trying to use OpenWrt as a regular/generic router. With the router accepting a wisp supplied IP on the wan port. I have it talking on wifi and the lan but have failed to get it to bring in my internet provider on the wan port.&nbsp; The wan port shows some traffic, both in and out, but uptime remains zero.&nbsp; I suspect the problem is incorrectly configured internal bridges.</p><p>Can someone point me to some resource that will not bog me down in the full capabilities of OpenWrt?</p>									</div>

					<p>A default configuration is designed to work much like typical stock firmware and route all internet requests from the LAN to WAN.&nbsp; Thus you should reset the router to default configuration first.&nbsp; Then configure your WAN.&nbsp; </p><p>If your WAN is coming in over wifi you need to create a wifi client mode interface with the SSID and password matching the service, then switch the WAN &quot;physical settings&quot; off of the ethernet port and over to the wifi.&nbsp; Make sure the wan is not a bridge (you should have radio buttons on the setup page that allow only choosing one interface-- not check boxes).</p><p>WAN IP address should not be in the same subnet as the LAN.&nbsp; In other words, if your ISP is giving you 192.168.1.x, change the LAN to 192.168.2.1 or something else other than the 1.1 default.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 28 May 2015, 22:30)</p>
