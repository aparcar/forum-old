					<p>Are there any plans to provide support for management of multiple routers/ap from a single interface similar to Ubiquiti Unifi controller software ? Once you have more than one device it does become a pain to log into separate units individually to check status, mesh, configuration options, firmware versions etc.</p><p>While providing a separate controller/management UI may be a lot of work, it may be less work to allow OpenWRT instances to be managed by the Unify controller itself. tp-link provide such facility so you can have a mixture of native APs and OpenWRT ones.</p><p>If this has been discussed previously I apologise.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hipitihop</strong> on 2 Jan 2017, 05:06)</p>
