					<p>Hello,<br />I am using openwrt with chillispot in linksys wrt54gl. My radius server is freeradius. When I start web browser, it is directed to login page and after entering username and password(login) only I can surf web.<br />But my problem is, without login also, I can send and receive email in microsoft outlook. It is using smtp (my workplace internal mail). Even without login I can use vnc and connect to remote server. I want to block it and user should only access outlook mails and vnc only after successful login.<br />It must be the problem with iptables. I am using iptables given by chillispot (firewall.openwrt).<br />Please help me!!</p><p>Regards,<br />Pratik</p>									</div>
