					<p>I currently have a TP-LINK TL-WR841ND with an external directional antenna in my detached, cinder block garage acting as a bridge to a Buffalo WZR-HP-G300N in my house. Would I see any throughput gains if I replaced both of these devices with dual band devices? Perhaps a pair of TP-LINK TL-WDR3600 or maybe even TP-LINK TL-WDR4300 for higher throughput? If I did that, I&#039;d just need to get another one or two external antennas for the device in my garage? Any thoughts?</p>									</div>

					<p>short answer: no idea.</p><p>but i&#039;m curious what kind of throughput are you seeing now?&nbsp; &nbsp;What&#039;s the distance ? <br />Also are you using a 20mhz (1 channel ) or 40 mhz (neighbor unfriendly and evil channel bonding, but it&#039;s ok if you live in the country or your neighbors don&#039;t use wifi or are otherwise far away) </p><p>What kind of signal strength are you seeing at the &quot;client&quot; side (tp)&nbsp; and AP side (buf)&nbsp; &nbsp;and at what speed are they connecting ?</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ll update with more specifics when I get home, but here&#039;s what I know off the top of my head.</p><p>The distance is only 20 - 25 ft. The throughput is fine for browsing, streaming audio, etc. The main reason I&#039;m looking to increase throughput is I&#039;m considering installing a few 720p cameras that&#039;ll record to an NVR at my house. So that&#039;ll increase traffic over the wireless link.</p><p>Do routers that have multiple streams work well as a bridges with external antennas?</p>									</div>

					<p>2 spartial streams with &quot;normal&quot; directional antennas won&#039;t work. But there are directional antennas e.g. from ubiquiti with can handle 2 startial stream. I think actually they are 2 antenna in one, one with horizontal polarisation and one with vertial polarisation.&nbsp; (But I think they are quite expensive)</p><p>You probalby should think about other possibilities first. e.g. as vhrm wrote using 40MHz (on 2,4 GHz of you have no neigbour-wifis) or on 5 GHz (but be aware that you need other antennas for 5GHz). you can get up to 150Mbit with one spartial stream and 40MHz which will get you up to 8-10 MByte/s real bandwith (if you have no interference)</p><p>btw. I hope the WZR-HP-G300N has a directional antenna, too and its wifi is only used for the bridge.</p>									</div>

					<p>I am running these at 40 MHz. The unit in my garage has the following info: dBmSignal: -59 dBm | Noise: -87 dBmBit Rate: 270.0 MBit/s. And my house is: Signal: -56 dBm | Noise: -95 dBmBit Rate: 92.2 MBit/s. I ran iperf between a computer on the wireless in the house and a computer in the garage and got 5.61 Mbits/sec. </p><p>The WZR-HP-G300N has non-removable omni antennas. I&#039;m not using it as a dedicated bridge but as a normal access point and using the TL-WR741ND as a client. I have an external antenna on this device because I wasn&#039;t getting a very good signal from inside my garage. So I attached the external antenna to the outside of the building to increase signal strength. </p><p>I have had experience using Ubiquiti products and considered something like a pair of Locos but assumed the distance was too small and I&#039;d have problems with over powering signals. I was hopeful I could bridge two N devices and achieve good throughput. Perhaps I should try with two AC routers? It doesn&#039;t appear any of these are compatible with OpenWRT at the moment though?</p>									</div>

					<p>i&#039;ll say up front that i haven&#039;t used 5ghz, but from what i&#039;ve read it&#039;s worse for range and worse through walls than 2.4 so in this case it doesn&#039;t sound like it would be great fit.&nbsp; &nbsp; (and i don&#039;t know enough about how much aggregation , if any, 802.11n does within and between bands so can&#039;t answer your originally real question). Hopefully someone else will clarify that part.&nbsp; &nbsp;But, i still think your current set-up should be considerably faster than what you&#039;re seeing.&nbsp; &nbsp; How much bw do you need for your cams ? </p><p>Did you measure both directions (-r ) ? <br />Also what happens if you plug-in the computer in the house&nbsp; to its router so that the only wireless activity is the bridge ?</p><p>Also, when running the throughput test, what info do you get from your AP about the client&#039;s wifi status?<br />(looks like this pic i found on the web ) <br /><a href="http://www.canyonero.com/files/1356047578.jpg">http://www.canyonero.com/files/1356047578.jpg</a></p><p>How&#039;s the CPU usage on the AP look?&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Just to double check: inside the garage your computers are wired to the TP, right ? <br />Do you have networks from the neighbors on your channels ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Wired -r I get 18.9 and 13.6 Mbits. This is from a wired machine in the house to the garage machine via the wireless bridge link.</p><p>CPU usage should be next to nothing because it&#039;s only acting as an AP/Bridge. I have a pfsense machine performing firewall/router duties.</p><p>Inside the garage the machine is wired.<br />I have networks from my neighbors on all channels (1,6,11). I picked the least congested for the bridge and use a different channel for the other AP I have in the house.</p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B04jstMhZ4bZRXcxZmw1dEctUlE/edit?usp=sharing">AP status info</a></p><p>It does look like I need to update the firmware on these. Perhaps that would help?</p><p>I&#039;m not sure about the bandwidth needed for the cams but it&#039;d be 720P recording 24x7 by two devices.</p><p>According to Wifi Analyzer/inSSIDer on my Nexus 4, no one is using 5 Mhz around me. Maybe I&#039;d have better luck with a pair of Nanostation Loco M5&#039;s? Also, because it was a good price, I ordered a TP-LINK TL-WDR3600 from NewEgg. Once this arrives I&#039;ll make the Buffalo WZR-HP-G300N in my house a dedicated bridge and not use it for AP functions. Perhaps this will also help speed up the link.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m using three tl-wr741nd outisde in bridge with integrated antennas only and I get about 5MB/s transfer from the main building (40Mhz channel width), the distance is about 30m and there are some other wifi networks around. I think, that you should be able to get 10MB/s (80Mbits) with wr841nd for such a short distance, if the disturbance isn&#039;t too high. I&#039;d try the units against each other indoor first to exclude bad config / old firmware.</p><p>Don&#039;t forget, that cable to antenna has some attenuation, for such a short distance might be better to use the integrated antenna and get the unit behind the window, I have them in plastic picnic boxes, they are cheap and waterproof :-)</p><p>Btw. ubnt M5 are great devices, capable of running openwrt too, if you like, but the factory firmware is good too.</p>									</div>

If I have to mount the house side outside and drill holes, it seems like at that point I might as well just run a cable.

					<p>I can&#039;t tell you about loco M5, but with 2 nanostations M5 (not loco), which have a bit stronger antennas, I have installed point to point bridge with 0,5m brick wall one one side and another is about 50m away outside. I don&#039;t remember exactly, how strong the signal was, but 20mbit connection worked at full speed.

					<p>I have a Netgear WNDR3800 downstairs bridging the internet to my WNDR3700AV in my room using the 5GHz band and I use the 2.4GHz band for client devices that need internet. I&#039;d say the two routers are approximately 50 feet away from eachother with quite a bit of walls and flooring between them. I have not run iperf to see how much bandwidth I&#039;m able to send over this bridge but I consistently download at just over 7MB (megabytes) a second which is what my internet connection is capable of. That&#039;s a far leap from your 5mbits link and I can only imagine there&#039;s some bandwidth to spare.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>arfett</strong> on 4 Mar 2013, 05:35)</p>
