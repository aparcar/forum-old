					<p>As one of the few OpenWRT-supported boards with a Mini-PCIe interface, I&#039;m trying to find a way to purchase a large number of RedWave RW2458N boards for shipment to the United States.</p><p><a href="http://www.redwave.cc/pro-view.asp?pid=1566">http://www.redwave.cc/pro-view.asp?pid=1566</a></p><p>Initial samples in quantities of 5x (or even just one, to see how well everything works!), and then about 250 at the end of this year. If all goes well, I&#039;ll eventually be looking at buying thousands a year.</p><p>I&#039;m setting some of my Chinese friends on parsing the RedWave website for leads, but does anyone know any site or supplier that actually sells these boards to the United States?</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>
