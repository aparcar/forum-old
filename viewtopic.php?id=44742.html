					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have just flashed a &quot;ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT (bleeding edge, r28863)&quot; into my LaFonera router.<br />I cannot use later releases because:<br />a) The router just has 16mb RAM<br />b) I&#039;m using special kernel modules (I2C, W1) that I have tested and are working on this release.</p><p>Anyway, my plan is to build a simple PHP page that can act as frontend for the devices I want to turn ON and OFF with I2C and W1.</p><p>I have included in the build image uhttp and PHP5, with php5-cgi.</p><p>In order to test if PHP is working fine, I have used a very small piece of code:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>&lt;html&gt;<br /> &lt;head&gt;<br />&nbsp; &lt;title&gt;PHP Test&lt;/title&gt;<br /> &lt;/head&gt;<br /> &lt;body&gt;<br /> &lt;?php echo &#039;&lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;&#039;; ?&gt; <br /> &lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;</p></blockquote></div><p>(the output should be as simple as &quot;Hello World&quot;). </p><p>However, this page takes 15 seconds to load. While is loading, the command prompt is very slow, and the &quot;top&quot; command shows <br /> VSZ at 56% and CPU at 47% for the process /usr/bin/php-cgi /www/t1.php (that&#039;s my test page).</p><p>Is there any workaround to make PHP faster? Can this be a (miss)configuration problem? I just did this: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/uhttpd#using.php5">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/uhttpd#using.php5</a></p><p>Thanks,<br />Jabss</p>									</div>

Maybe look into Lua or bash scripts as more lightweight alternatives for building CGI programs.</p></blockquote></div><p>Indeed, the sympthoms seem to indicate that I&#039;m hitting the HW limits. However, I have another fonera with r28863 compiled ~2 years ago (I don&#039;t have its buildroot environment anymore) and the same page takes ~3 seconds to load, which for my purpose is acceptable.</p><p>So, I assume it should be some SW difference. How can&nbsp; I compare? Should I look to the modules loaded on each (lsmod), or just with the packages installed? (opkg list-installed).The idea is to identify what &quot;heavy&quot; software is running on my &quot;slow&quot; fonera and take it out...</p><p>Any suggestion?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Jabss</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jabss</strong> on 16 Jun 2013, 03:12)</p>
