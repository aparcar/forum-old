					<p>adduser openwrt<br />su openwrt<br />make</p><br /><p>The reason I don&#039;t want to compile as root is that frankly I don&#039;t trust the code, and I don&#039;t really feel like browsing every makefile and every source file to make sure that no harm will be done to my system. Compiling as root has never been considered a safe practice.<br />Also, it&#039;s completely redundant because the system uses fakeroot. You don&#039;t need root privs.</p>									</div>
