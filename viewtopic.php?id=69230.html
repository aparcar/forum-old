					<p>I am trying to setup a captive portal on a Meraki MR16, I&#039;ve flashed the device and have OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05 running. I&#039;ve installed both coovachilli and wifidog but everytime I try and start the service, it doesn&#039;t do anything. I don&#039;t get an error and I tried to check the processes according to the guide and it doesn&#039;t show it running.</p><p>Are there some logs I can look at and determine why this neither are starting?</p>									</div>

					<p>coova-chilli alone is good enough. Or Wifidog only, but not both.<br />Dunno WifiDog, but to get coova-chilli up and running is some type of &quot;Magic&quot;. You have to study a lot of info from the web. May be, setup of WiFiDog is simpler, but not so flexible. Again, install only one of them.</p>									</div>
