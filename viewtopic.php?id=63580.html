					<p>Hello <strong>OpenVRT</strong>,<br />Recently I check <strong>OpenWRT</strong> website for changing the firmware of my Router &quot;<strong>Archer C50 V1</strong>&quot; I found url <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/hwdata/tp-link/tp-link_archer_c50_v1">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/hwdata/tp- … her_c50_v1</a> but I can not replace the curent firmware from Tp-Link.</p><p>Firmware Version: 1.0 v0045.0 Build 150325 Rel.43331n<br />Hardware Version: Archer C50 v1 00000000</p><p>And I try on DD-WRT but they are not that kind and deleted my post.<br />Hope there is an solution because when I upload .bin image from that url error pops up. <br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i65.tinypic.com/akbb10.jpg" alt="http://i65.tinypic.com/akbb10.jpg" /></span><br /><em>If I upload the firmware from tp-link that work.
