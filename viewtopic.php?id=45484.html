					<p>I have a working source tree to compile the toolchain for most realtek SoC&#039;s (openrsdk 1.3.6)<br /><a href="http://theigb.com/sapido/openrsdk-1.3.6.tar.bz2">http://theigb.com/sapido/openrsdk-1.3.6.tar.bz2</a></p><p>I&#039;ve got openwrt compiling for a RTL8196c, using an external toolchain; and can compile the toolchain from source; the only thing I&#039;m missing, is how to go about adding toolchain patches and architectures.</p><p>The RSDK toolchain bastardizes the mipseb toolchain; so obviously I need some way to only introduce this patch for targets that call specifically for the rsdk toolchain.</p><p>Also; once I get the complete patch set created, and compiling properly on more than 1 platform; who do I need to talk to about getting the patches added to the official trunk?</p><p>V/r,<br />Conjur</p><p>EDIT: Drawing dead on this one again; I just bricked my last Sapido RB-1132v2.<br />Out of 10x RB-1132&#039;s:<br />4 are v1 (rtl8196bu, a 1-off of the rtl8196b; most code works; but all of the memory addresses are ... off...<br />3 bricked SPI flash from trying (intentionally or not) to replace the CFE (bootloader)<br />2 bricked SPI flash from burning out the SPI Flash from overwriting too many times (They still kind of work; but without jffs on the kernel, there&#039;s no bad block checks)<br />1 burned out the CPU from overuse (no heatsync, can&#039;t handle sustained bandwidth) (was running it as bridge; with the ethernet ports bonded)</p><p>I&#039;m still working on the 8196BU; but it&#039;s unlikely that I&#039;ll ever get a full openwrt image compiling properly.
