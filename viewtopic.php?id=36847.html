					<p>i have a bridged modem/router that is supplied via isp to this i currently have a netgear 4500 router attached all is fine.<br />But I would like to put my openwrt DIR825 in between and turn off the dhcp and some other services on the net-gear router and let this and other stuff to be handled by the DIR825. ie trun the Net gear in to a expensive switch for wireless and local hosts.<br /> netgear will have ipadd 192.168.1.2<br />dir825 will have 192.168.1.1<br />reserved ipadd for hosts and various gadgets 192.168.1.3,4,5,6,101</p><p>I will not be using the wireless on the dir825 it is much slower then the netgear and i have plenty of coverage.</p><p>Is this logical and will it work?</p>									</div>
