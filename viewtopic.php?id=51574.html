					<p>Hi folks, I have written this simple script to run a python one every time my usb drive is connected to my device. This is the code &quot;</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

BINARY=&quot;/usr/bin/python&quot;
LEXAR_PRODID=&quot;5dc/a815/1100&quot;

if [ &quot;${PRODUCT}&quot; = &quot;${LEXAR_PRODID}&quot; ]
then

    if [ &quot;${ACTION}&quot; = &quot;add&quot; ];
    then

        ${BINARY} /root/writefile.py &amp;

    fi

fi</code></pre></div><p>and then the python script itself :</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

# Scrive un file.
out_file = open(&quot;/root/TESTWRITE.txt&quot;,&quot;a&quot;)
out_file.write(&quot;This Text is going to out file\nLook at it and see\n&quot;)
out_file.close()</code></pre></div><p>which appends a content to the same file once invoked while bash script is always run with priority 99 once the usb drive is plugged in. However, the strange fact is that the python script is invoked twice as I insert it into my device, so the output is :</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>This Text is going to out file
Look at it and see
This Text is going to out file
Look at it and see</code></pre></div><p>....any suggestions ? Thanks in advance. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Kind Regards, Arturo</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>arty.net</strong> on 12 Jul 2014, 21:38)</p>

					<p>it has to be executed ONCE and not twice, that&#039;s the issue. The only managed event is &quot;add&quot; and not &quot;remove&quot;. I&#039;m still wondering why it happens....I could try to sleep the whole process of a couple of seconds with : </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>sleep 3

					<p>What I did is to check for $DEVTYPE as well. That variable is set to &quot;usb_device&quot; the first time and to &quot;usb_interface&quot; on the second call. It may be the other way round I don&#039;t remember.</p>									</div>
