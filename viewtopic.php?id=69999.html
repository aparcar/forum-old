					<p>Hello, this has been my first experience doing anything like this, it went pretty smooth until now. I flashed my Netgear WNDR3700 v3 using the update firmware within Netgear&#039;s software. Everything was working perfectly. The other night I was in the connection interface tab and the ports are labeled a little confusing and I believe I mistakenly unbridged a connection or turned off the ethO (switch?). I can no longer login using 192.168.1.1. So I read the procedure for the failsafe mode but I can&#039;t seem to get it to boot up in safe mode. Every reference for my router says I should turn off the router and then hold the reset button until the orange light turns green. The problem is I don&#039;t think my light was ever green after installing the openwrt. It flashes orange and then after 5 seconds or so all the port lights light up green for a sec and then it just stays orange. I&#039;ve tried holding the button down for several minutes and nothing, I&#039;ve tried pressing the reset button, wifi button, wps button repeatedly after powering on and every time the light sequence is the same. I can ping the router at 192.168.1.1 when I set a static IP of 192.168.1.10 on my Mac using terminal. I tried to use a TFTP client app on my Mac to connect and re install the original software or the original Netgear image but it gives me an error or times out. I&#039;ve tried to time the TFTP while pinging the router but it seems like no matter what I try it just starts up the same every time. I&#039;ve tried using different lan ports on the router also. Its been fun learning as I go but at this point I feel like I&#039;ve locked my keys in the car, walked to the closest bar, and then forgot where I parked! I&#039;m sure I left out plenty of important info. Any guidance would be appreciated. Thanks.</p>									</div>
