You seem to have a concept of how this forum works and how its members and visitors should behave. However, as you can see, it is not immediately obvious, and hard to deduct from your postings. If you don&#039;t mind, take this opportunity to at least outline your idea of proper conduct in here so we all can understand each other better.</p>									</div>

Ironically, your post fits three of your typical patterns:<br />A) you go off on a tangent, typically after you realized you lost an argument.<br />B) you do rather shoddy research and your recommendations are dubious at best.<br />C) you phrase your responses so terse that the lack proper indicators what they refer to, in an obvious attempt to maintain &quot;plausible deniability&quot; (as if this forum would be a court of law)</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To not get fully off-topic, that link above contains a lot of recommendations to deal with little &quot;stinkers&quot; that simply do not know any better. I wonder how much of that is applicable to a forum with an apparently not yet potty-trained member...</p><br /><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>

Interestingly, while doing so it became clear to me that his area of expertise is not as broad as he assumes and he repeatedly starts from the wrong premise (which in itself is nothing to be ashamed of, it happens to all of us, but in his case it just seems doubly ironic).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It also has stronger impact on new-comers if we actually both tell Max to stop AND add helpful information to a thread than just telling Max of.

So we either slowly try to &quot;house-train&quot; him or we keep annoying him when his posts are out of line (or do both in a push pull fashion). Even as he seems to be a glutton for punishment his reactions to loosing arguments show that he dislikes that just like the rest of us (only his attitude makes him more prone to get into an argument underprepared and hence more likely to loose it).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>moeller0</strong> on 23 Aug 2016, 16:04)</p>

					<p>At present I&#039;m not visiting this forum as I used to be, but he is everywhere, so it is quite easy to make an opinion. Even Max Hopper can sometimes be helpful, but he&#039;s somewhere between not kind and outright arrogant, so the exact opposite from what this forum was without him. He is spoiling the vibe of this forum and I think he should wear badge like troll warning, do not feed under his nick name ;-)</p>									</div>
