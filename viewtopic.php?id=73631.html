					<p>I am sure that this has been covered a number of times, however with the recent merge of LEDE Project and OpenWRT, maybe there have been changes.<br />I have used the search function and can not find anything recent since the merge.</p><p>I have a TP-Link TL-WR1043ND Hardware version 4.<br />I originally looked at this 6 months ago and found that the Gargoyle project does not support this version of the hardware. I have been using the LEDE firmware for the last 6 months without schedules or bandwidth limitations.</p><p>Today I downloaded the latest firmware from openwrt and uploaded it to the router. All is up and running with the previous settings. (I did not brick it thank goodness)</p><p>I was wondering if there have been any changes since the merge, that could help my cause at home.<br />I have kids at home and need to at lease change schedules for the wifi to be operational during certain times.<br />I have just finished downloading the &quot;luci-app-wifischedule&quot; app and plan on setting it up soon.</p><p>I was wondering if there has been any progress in regards to bandwidth Quotas?<br />Any assistance will be greatly appreciated.</p>									</div>
