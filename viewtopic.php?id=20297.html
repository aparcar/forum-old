					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m using the &quot;brcm-2.4&quot; version of Kamikaze with the &quot;kmod-brcm-wl-mimo&quot; driver. I have been using it as a client (sta+wpa2) for a while and it has been working perfectly. Now I would like to add AP (ap+wpa2) to my setup and have configured the necessary information in the &quot;/etc/config/wireless&quot; file. The AP seems to start up as it should but when I try to connect to it the client fails to get an IP address - if I disable the encryption everything works. I have tried both WPA and WPA2 for the AP but have so far only been successful with an unencrypted network (The router&#039;s client mode is still using WPA2 though). Have I missed anything in my configuration or is this a known issue?</p><p>/etc/config/wireless<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-device wl0
