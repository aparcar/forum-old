					<p>I have installed Kamikaze on my WL-700gE using the tutorial found at this URL:</p><p><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=12887">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=12887</a></p><p>I have it now booting from the hard drive and all my packages etc setup.&nbsp; However, when the router is powered up cold, the HDD does not seem to spin up in time, and the router defaults to the basic image installed in flash.&nbsp; To get it to boot from the HDD I have to telnet into the device and use the &#039;reboot&#039; command.<br />I now want to install a new basic image on the flash that delays the bootup longer to allow the HDD to spin up, however, for some reason I can&#039;t TFTP the new image up because the router won&#039;t go into diag mode for some reason.&nbsp; Anyway, is it possible to write a new image to the flash using the mtd command?&nbsp; If so, for this hardware platform, what is the MTD command to do so?</p><p>Is it &#039;mtd -r write kamikaze.trx linux&#039;?</p><p>Cheers.</p>									</div>
