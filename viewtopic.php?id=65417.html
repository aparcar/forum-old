					<p>Hi. This is my first post here.<br />I own a business and only available internet service here is 5Mbps/0.6Mbps DSL.<br />But the internet is very important for my business so I&#039;ve been trying to get something better.<br />Recently I found out that I can access cablewifi hot spot provided by cox who is the internet service provider at my home.</p><p>Their wifi hotspot is located about just 100 ft away from my building. But I can not good signal inside of my shop which is made of concrete. But as soon as I step out of my building, I can get 40/10Mbps on my phone no problem.</p><p>So here is the plan I laid out.<br />I bought a TP-LINK DUAL WAN VPN Router TL-ER6020. <br />I connected my DSL modem to the WAN2 port of my new router which is working fine now.<br />Now, I want to connect cablewifi to WAN1 of the router. So I can use WAN1 for daily use and WAN2 as back up.</p><p>So, I bought TP-LINK TL-WA801ND Wireless N300 2T2R Access Point to connect the cablewifi hot spot in the client mode and somehow to make wired connection to my router&#039;s WAN1 port.</p><p>But I can&#039;t make it work. Mainly it&#039;s because cablewifi require you to sign in and agree their terms once connected to them. So I need to login cablewifi using my computer, then I must do the mac address spoofing from TL-WA801ND so it accept connection without requiring log in.</p><p>But TL-WA801ND has no option for mac address spoofing.<br />So I am trying to see if I can do this with openWRT.</p><p>So here are my questions.</p><p>1st question.<br />Is this doable? I mean, can I somehow use a wifi device to connect to the hotspot and bring a line from this device to my router&#039;s WAN port? What do I need and how should I do this?</p><p>2nd question.<br />I need to setup an outdoor antenna on the roof of my building because I don&#039;t get good signal inside of my building. The hotpot is only about 100ft away without anything blocking in between though.&nbsp; Is a directional parabolic antenna would be an over kill? My phone connects just fine as soon as I step out of my building.<br />Should I use 2.4GHz antenna or 5GHz? (My business is located in an industrial area)</p><p>3rd question. <br />Which router would you guys recommend? I think I need a router with external antenna so I can connect my outdoor antenna. Which routers are most compatible with openWRT and has external-replacable antenna?</p><p>Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>thelinux</strong> on 9 Jun 2016, 02:03)</p>

					<p>ALRIGHT Thelinux&nbsp; i though about it what you need to do to log on to your cable cox hot spot is put OPENWRT on your<br /> TP-LINK TL-WA801ND they should have support for yours if not OPENWRT got support for all kinds of routers.Set up your&nbsp; TP-LINK TL-WA801ND as a simple bridge plug it up to your router that&#039;s it your set up.to set up a bridge you can use the WIKI on openwrt site or use this.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEj2ySQ26zo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEj2ySQ26zo</a></p><p>at 100 foot it should work.</p>									</div>

					<p>Does the AP have openwrt on it NO it has stock firmware if he asked can he log on with stock firmware i would say no way and thats the problem he has he can&#039;t log on with his AP with stock firmware.With openwrt log in 192.168.1.1 log in go to network/wifi/scan/&nbsp; In your list of available networks,&nbsp; Select your Internet provider from the list join.MOST hot spots don&#039;t have incription if hot spot hand out a IP GOOD if not it want work until you have a IP if you get a working IP&nbsp; Launch your Internet browse go to the appropriate HTTP URL to log in i never log in to a cox hot spot probably the first thing is the TOS agrement&nbsp; after that Sign in with your Username and Password.If you can log in with a laptop and a phone their a way you can do it with openwrt. I can&#039;t get to that log in window,he can&#039;t get to the log in page in the the browser there is nothing in the luci or in the gui in any other wireless firmware you get the wifi working log in with browser window.With openwrt you can put any MAC address on it you want if the mac is a problem you can change it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ckm</strong> on 11 Jun 2016, 20:43)</p>

					<p>While I agree that Max tends to be a &quot;bad actor&quot; I have been hoping for a real solution to the (big picture) question in this post.&nbsp; </p><p>This is a current and topical issue for anyone using a travel router in public hot spots.&nbsp; While the OP has attempted to solve this with MAC spoofing, I do not consider this a good solution in public venues.&nbsp; I do not think this is as much an issue of secure or insecure wireless connections, as it is the TOS\Splash page not being passed from the STAtion side to the AP clients (my non-technical interpretation).&nbsp; </p><p>Max&#039;s referenced solution appears to be designed for a known STAtion connection, which is the OPs case; however the OP has not objected to signing in (I believe) to the portal, but is unable to get the sign in page.&nbsp; &nbsp; Neither this nor MAC spoofing is a great solution in public venues.</p><p>Travel routers have led to new logistical issues for which the current OpenWrt tools are just not adequate.&nbsp; These are now a handful of ways to address the inability to connect when the STAtion changes (Limitations of a single radio), but this issue haunts me in almost every public location with a portal.&nbsp; The only work around I have been able to find is to get the address of the local portal page and save it as a web shortcut.&nbsp; Even then, in my most frequent hotel, the lease time indicated in the portal page is often not respected.&nbsp; I have no issues with my PC directly connected.</p><p>While the OP is not using a travel router, his issues are more like a travel router than the typical bridge.&nbsp; There is a true technical solution needed, though it is beyond my technical abilities.</p>									</div>
