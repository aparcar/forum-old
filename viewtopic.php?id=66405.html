					<p>Hi,<br />I was trying to install custom build openwrt release on Linksys E2000 when it suddenly stopped working properly. I did try to reset the AP but all goes in vain. Currently the LAN ports are working properly and when connected to these LAN ports, my system gets IP and can successfully ping the gateway 192.168.1.1<br />The power light is blinking quite fast and the WiFi light is OFF. SSID is not being broadcasted.<br />I have tried to Telnet/SSH to AP, but its not responding to that.<br />Any idea how I resolve the issue/ how can I reinstall firmware on the AP. Thanks</p>									</div>
