					<p>Hello all, <br />I have more bandwidth than I use, on a reliable rented server in the USA. I&#039;d like to do something useful with said bandwidth (2500gb/mo). If the maintainers are interested, I could mirror all or part of the downloads server, and keep up-to-date with rsync. If you care to ping it, it is neptune.sinister.com. </p><p>However, I wonder if bittorrent might be a better option for larger files, especially new releases. If this were the case, I could offer more bandwidth, from my home and other servers I own which I can not dedicate full-time as mirrors but could do a good job seeding openwrt.</p>									</div>
