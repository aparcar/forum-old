					<p>Hello. <br />First of all (in my defence) I want to say that I&#039;ve been looking for information in the wikis and in the net, but I didn&#039;t find anything that fitted my level of understanding on openwrt (which is, at the moment quite low).</p><p>My target is to create a wifi network with the openwrt router, that would be provided conection to the internet by another router (not running openwrt) via ethernet. I also want a PC to connect to the internet via ethernet with the openwrt router.</p><p>My problem is not having a web interface. It got broken when I set the bridge mode on and I can&#039;t access it any more. Also I&#039;ve been trying to do something by connecting to my router via telnet and ssh, and I did; the telnet connection and the ssh one work perfectly when the only thing connected to the router is my PC. But, when I plug in the ethernet cable to the other router, the openwrt one just disapears and get unreachable (also, the PC gets connected to the internet). If I type &quot;telnet 192.168.1.1&quot; I get to the other router&#039;s login response as if this one did not exist.</p><p>So, as I don&#039;t have any way of reaching the internet with my router I can&#039;t install LUCI, and my little knowledge on setting up networks in the command line allows me very few possibilities.</p><p>Any ideas?</p>									</div>

					<p>So you have: Internet &lt;&gt; a router &lt;&gt; openwrt router &lt;&gt; PC + WIFI?</p><p>Two sorts of bridge. One is when a modem/router is turned into just a modem with another router behind it that does authentication, DNS, DHCP etc. and the second is what happens inside the router when you bolt logical networks together to look like one. Classic example is WIFI - LAN which shows up as &quot;br-lan&quot;. Which router was bridged? </p><p>Second they all need to be on different addresses. If you are that new to CLI and networks it just might be simpler to take just the router cabled to a PC and nothing else and re-install OpenWRT.<br /> on it and start fresh. </p><p>HTH</p>									</div>

					<p>Actually I have (or I want to have) :</p><p>Internet &lt;&gt; Router+PC &lt;&gt; Openwrt router &lt;&gt; PC + WiFi</p><p>What I tried to do the day I broke the webUI was to bridge the non openwrt router&#039;s WiFi to the openwrt one (when I turned on the bridge mode, I lost connection with it). I couldn&#039;t do it and I forgot about it for a few months.</p><p>I have tried to give the openwrt router a different local IP from the other&#039;s one (which is 192.168.1.1) and I changed the IP in /etc/config/nework to 192.168.1.2 but it is still not accesible when connected to the other router! (which I can&#039;t understand).</p><p>I can&#039;t set just one openwrt router because the main problem I have is the attenuation of the router&#039;s signal through my home&#039;s floors, but I have this ethernet cable (brought to the upper floor) that may provide, together with the openwrt router, the WiFi signal to this floor, where I wish to use both my desktop PC and my laptop. Also I think my level is low configuring networks from the CLI, not using it (I&#039;ve been using linux for a long time and it becomes necesary).</p><p>At the moment I would just like to be able to access the openwrt router while this is connected to the other one (so that it is connected to the internet and I can install the webUI) and then keep trying to build the network that I mentioned before.</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>efg092</strong> on 4 Mar 2013, 13:55)</p>

					<p>What you&nbsp; could do is forget about the OpenWRT router being a router. Instead of connecting a LAN port of the first to the WAN port on the second, which I assume is what you are doing,&nbsp; connect to a LAN port on the second. Is is now just a switch with WIFI. Turn off DHCP&nbsp; etc. on it so everything uses the first router - it will still need it&#039;s own address for configuring.</p>									</div>
