					<p>Ok so it looks like I may be a moron.&nbsp; I had the latest firware from linksys running on my wrt54g (AMD chip) and I decided to flash it with Hyper 2.0b3.&nbsp; I ended up with a bricked box and a blinking red Diag light.&nbsp; The box would not respond to ping or light up for the lan connection.&nbsp; I opened the box and shorted the pins to get the unit de-bricked.&nbsp; I then used tftp to reinstall the linksys firmware.&nbsp; Now the box will come up on its own and respond to ping, however it will not do anything else and i still have a blinking red diag light.&nbsp; I have tried flashing with other files but nothing will flash but the latest Linksys file.&nbsp; So now I have a de-bricked wrt but i cannot get it to reach a point that it can actually be used again.&nbsp; Suggestions for the noob?</p>									</div>

					<p>The fact it has a diag light an an amd flash chip means it&#039;s an original v1.0. The flashing diag led means that the firmware is not booting or invalid and you need to tftp a working firmware, in tftp&#039;s binary mode, to 192.168.1.1.</p><p>If you read anything this should have been the first thing that you tried, so I&#039;m a little confused as to why you asked. Make sure to use a standard tftp client, not one from linksys which uses a password, and make sure there&#039;s no networking issues trying to send to 192.168.1.1.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have tried to tftp several firmware versions all with the same blinking red light result.&nbsp; Is it possible that the latest version from Linksys 3.01.3 will not allow to flash backwards?&nbsp; If not then please recommend a firmware.</p><br /><p>Also I have re-loaded the 3.01.3 (the only one that actually tftp&#039;s sucessfully) and I am still blinking red.&nbsp; Also is the binary mode a setting in the program or does the tftp.exe run in binary mode all the time?</p>									</div>

					<p>So here is something interesting.&nbsp; I got frustrated and just tried flashing and reflashing the router over and over again with different firmwares.&nbsp; And after one attempt with the latest version from Linksys I actually got the router to come back to life!!!&nbsp; Sooooo, now that I have a working WRT54G V 1.0 with the latest firmware 3.01.3 is there a way for me to put a 3rd party version on this box that will allow me to boot the output of my router in order to serve my entire house effectively???? Any input is welcome.</p>									</div>
