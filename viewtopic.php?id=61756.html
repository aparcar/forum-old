					<p>I have just started to dig into open wrt.</p><p>One of the things I have found is that port 53 is open wan&nbsp; because of dnsmasq.</p><p>When I edited the dnsmasq config file to turn force the server to attach to the local active lan interface,<br />one can nolonger edit the network firewall traffic rules</p><p>Other routers do not have port 53 open to the wan. Why does openwrt need this?&nbsp; Is there anyway to configure <br />openwrt so that port 53 is not open on the public wan and one can still edit the network firewall traffic rules?</p>									</div>

					<p>Just because dnsmasq is listening on port 53 of all interfaces does not mean that port 53 is open on the WAN interface; remember there is a firewall that blocks access to any port, unless explicitly configured. Port 53 is definitively closed on the WAN interface on my router.</p>									</div>
