					<h5>Near to brick&nbsp; ..</h5><p>What I did until now:<br />First I uploaded Wingspinner&#039;s HooToo-Tripmate-HT-TM02-OpenWRT. Worked all well. 87% free&nbsp; memory for packages.<br />Then I tried to add the USB-Audio package, but the trunk version did not fit Wingspinner&#039;s kernel version and I could not find packages with audio for his kernel version. So I updated the system with the standard openwrt-15.05-ramips-rt305x-ht-tm02-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin<br />Now I could add the kmod-usb-audio; after reboot I got the kernel log message that the file system was set to ReadOnly.<br />Ok, I flashed the standard openwrt-15.05-ramips-rt305x-ht-tm02.initramfs-uImage....bin ( not sysupgrade) with unchecked &quot;Keep Settings&quot;. Result: everything was running again, filesystem was ok, but no space for packages left (0%)<br />Grmbl .. finally I&nbsp; flashed the current trunk sysupgrade with unchecked &quot;keep settings&quot;. Since then I can ping the device and have access via PUTTY, but LuCi doesn&#039;t come up.<br />Now I&#039;m afraid to brick the device if I do the wrong steps .. anyone who can tell me exactly how to continue? (I&#039;m no Linux guy, but I can handle command lines and even the stone-aged vi editor) Best seems to me an downgrade to older 14.7, because that seems to need less space.</p><p>TIA,<br />Joachim</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>joschl</strong> on 28 Nov 2015, 12:07)</p>

					<p>Hello, I wanted to add that I have the TripMate version of the HT-TM-01. it basically has a 6000Ma battery on it.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www.hootoo.com/media/pic/HT-TM01.jpeg" alt="HootooHT-MT01" /></span></p><p>I have just loaded OpenWRT on it with your instructions and it works perfect, much more functional than stock.</p><p>I am not a router expert and I have 1 basic question,<br />I have 2 different usecases for this router - 1. I want to bridge the wifi and the Ethernet port on the same lan.<br />It did this by default.<br />2. I need it to sometime function as a traditional router, with a Statis address on the Ethernet port and serving DHCP addresses on the wifi, which is masqueraded to the Ethernet port.</p><p>I have set up the interfaces, Wifi and firewall to accomplish #2</p><p>My question is, Is there a easy way I can switch between these 2 configurations? <br />Can a shell script do this and can the button on the router initiate the script?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>F4u5t</strong> on 5 Dec 2015, 16:54)</p>

					<p>Hi !<br />The Kernal.bin is somehow hard (i am not a linux wizard) to extract it but i managed and got my tm02 back to life.<br />I cannot send a forum message so you would have to post a working email then i can send it to you.<br />You could edit / delete the posting after i sent the file to eliminate security / spam concerns.</p><p>One hint:<br />I used tftpd32 and it did NOT answer that request so i was angry about that tftp client.<br />Turned out (like always) that i was beeing stupid. When first starting the tftp server Windows 10 asked me if it should allow connections on private &amp; public networks and i only checked private. But the Ethernet interface on 10.10.10.3 was marked as public so THAT was the reason why the server did not seem to work.<br />MY FAULT.</p><p>So give me an email and i send you the &quot;Kernal.bin&quot; (dont rename, this is how it should be named).</p><p>Greetings,<br />Ender</p><p>P.S. the file is about 4 MByte !</p><p>P.P.S. if you want to do it for yourself the exact method is mentioned LATER in the above mentioned link from mmdonuts, its post #317 !

 gpio-14  (modeswitch          ) in  hi</code></pre></div><p>when the switch is set to &quot;the antennae&quot; modeswitch reads hi, otherwise lo.&nbsp; I use a shell script something like:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>SYS_GPIO=&quot;/sys/kernel/debug/gpio&quot;
grep -q &#039;modeswitch.*lo&#039; $SYS_GPIO &amp;&amp; mode=&quot;globe&quot; || mode=&quot;antennae&quot;</code></pre></div><p>When the switch is changed, scripts in /etc/hotplug.d/button are called.&nbsp; I named mine /etc/hotplug.d/button/10-mode.&nbsp; The environment variable BUTTON is set to BTN_0, and the variable ACTION is set to &quot;pressed&quot; or &quot;released&quot;.&nbsp; I believe button scripts are also called for the reset button, so it could be important to check which button has changed.&nbsp; I did not use, the ACTION value, but instead always find the state from the gpio file (since a button event is not sent for the initial power-on position).</p><p>Caveats - I suspect there&#039;s a better interface to read the gpio status.&nbsp; The /sys/kernel/debug file system might not always be mounted. The hotplug.d directory predates procd, and it may be remodeled after the Chaos Calmer release.</p>									</div>

					<p>You should search back in this thread for photos. <br />Observe the locking points of the case. No screws are used.<br />To open up your router you could use a credit card. Gentle, be careful not to break the plastic pins.<br />Once you get first pin loose, the rest are coming easy.<br />Good luck.</p>									</div>
