					<p>You have two options:</p><p>1) Write a cron script around the following:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>. /lib/functions/network.sh; network_flush_cache; network_get_ipaddr ip wan; echo $ip</code></pre></div><p>2) Hook into the hotplug events detailed here and use the script above on the bound event for the wan interface:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=231212#p231212">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 12#p231212</a></p><p>Option 2 seems more elegant and efficient.&nbsp; Just compare $ip to a file, send the email if the IP has changed, and update the file to the current $ip.&nbsp; You can use mailsend or your preferred smtp client to send the email.</p><p>I may go ahead and write the hotplug script myself, because it seems handy to have in the lineup.&nbsp; I&#039;ll follow-up if you need help.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fecaleagle</strong> on 7 Sep 2015, 05:46)</p>

					<p>Ah, I see.&nbsp; The IP assigned by your ISP is generally referred to as the WAN IP.&nbsp; That is what the script I posted seeks to accomplish.&nbsp; The second suggestion in my first reply seems to give finer-grained control over the hooked event.&nbsp; I will attempt to implement that method as well and follow up here.</p><p>I generally don&#039;t need to do this, because I pay for No-IP DNS service, and I use their daemon on my server to post my IP address to them whenever it changes, but I am interested in determining the best way to accomplish this on my own as well.&nbsp; Unfortunately, my WAN IP has not changed since I implemented the script.&nbsp; I am keeping my eye on lease times and waiting for that e-mail!</p>									</div>

					<p>Let me know how it goes.&nbsp; It will be a couple more days before I can try anything.&nbsp; I decided to stick with tasking my router to email me when the IP address changes because I am sure if there is a poweroutage that the router and modem will both come back online.&nbsp; I was also going to look into having the router email me monthly with a status update regardless of whether the IP address changes.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have been extremely busy, and haven&#039;t had much time to work on this project.&nbsp; However, recently I tried to flash my DGND3700v1 to Chaos Calmer so I could use mail protocols.&nbsp; When I did, the 2.4 ghz wifi became unreliable and the 5 ghz wouldn&#039;t work at all; reference <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=295117#p295117">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 17#p295117</a></p><p>Because of this I had to flash back to Barrier Breaker so that my family and I can use wifi.&nbsp; I want to look into options for going to Chaos Calmer because my wifi doesn&#039;t work after restarting the router in BB.&nbsp; I have to go to each wifi options, deselect and reselect &quot;lan&quot; before it will work.</p><p>Anyway, I am still working on the project.&nbsp; Thanks for keeping up with me.</p>									</div>
