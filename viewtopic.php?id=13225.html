					<p>I have a network comprising 4 WRT54G running 0.9 WhiteRussian. I use WPA-PSK and WDS (not lazy).</p><p>The network is fairly stable. One WRT54G (call it M) serves two wireless Squeezeboxes. No real issues.</p><p>There are two intermittent clients: one laptop, one desktop. Router P serves the laptop, and router S serves the desktop.</p><p>I&#039;ve discovered that these clients can sometimes claim to be connected to their respective routers, but attempts<br />to send traffic (eg ping) fail. The Windows ZeroConfiguration wireless manager shows the connections are up and &quot;excellent&quot;.</p><p>I&#039;ve finally discovered that re-running S41wpa will successfully correct this problem. I suspect the real problem is that<br />nas is no longer running!</p><p>I looked on the main gateway router (router F), and I see that although /var/run/nas.lan.pid is present, the corresponding<br />nas process is nowhere to be seen! Apparently nas was started, then died some time.</p><p>Is this a known problem with nas?</p><p>Are there known problems with nas?</p><p>Are there any known workarounds?</p>									</div>

					<p>After some research I think <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=10519">this thread</a> is relevant.</p><p>It talks about using the newer version of nas from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/sources/broadcom-wl-4.80.9.2.tar.bz2">http://downloads.openwrt.org/sources/br â€¦ .2.tar.bz2</a>.</p><p>It references <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=9700&amp;p=1">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=9700&amp;p=1</a> which describes symptoms similar to mine.</p>									</div>
