					<p>My old Netgear WNR3500Lv1 has died and I was using Tomato on it and had a VPN (not OpenVPN) back to our Draytek at the office and I was also using per user bandwidth limiting and I never had a problem, it just worked. I have just bought a WRT1200AC to replace it and I am looking to install OpenWRT on it, I have read the guides and they take me to a download page with loads of different firmware listed, I have no idea which one I want.<br />I am currently using the stock firmware but it does not support normal VPN&#039;s and does not have per user rate limiting, will the OpenWRT firmware support it on my 1200 as I am going round in circles, one document references another which I start to read and that references another..............<br />Sorry if this has been covered before but I could not see a way to search the forum. I did start to read the WRT1900AC thread but I began to loose the will to live after about 50 pages in <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Cheers</p>									</div>

					<p>Found the search button abot 5 seconds after I had posted it, I had caught the scroll wheel on my mouse and the top of the page was hidden, thats my story and I&#039;m sticking to it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> </p><p>OpenWrt is now installed (thank you for the links) and running with wireless, DHCP etc runnaning as anticipated. Next on the list is to reserve some IP&#039;s and sort the scheduling out, then I have just got to figue out how to configure a PPTP VPN client on it and stop the kids using all the bandwidth.</p>									</div>
