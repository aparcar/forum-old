					<p>Hi,<br />I searched on the internet but didn&#039;t found anything about this question.<br />How to use one port for LAN and WAN at the same time ? OpenWRT runs on my laptop with only one ethernet port, it&#039;s connected to a switch. On Debian I managed to do like this but on Openwrt I got stucked. I need something like eth0.1 for LAN and eth0.2 for WAN connection</p>									</div>

					<p>You are talking about a 802.1Q (VLAN or virtual LAN) configuration, where multiple IP networks exist on the same physical wire (or physical port).</p><p>The most common way to accomplish this in OpenWRT is to use the &#039;swconfig&#039; tool: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/swconfig">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/swconfig</a></p><p>After you have mapped out the switch chip on your router, you can write the configuration to the /etc/config/network, and it will be applied automatically when the network is started during boot: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network/switch">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network/switch</a></p><p>EDIT: Whoops, you&#039;re running it on laptop. That changes things a bit, since laptops might not have switch chips. Maybe a software-based VLAN using the &#039;ip&#039; command and &#039;iproute2&#039; package? I&#039;m not sure if this package is available pre-built for OpenWRT, though.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Antek</strong> on 16 Aug 2017, 20:24)</p>

					<p>It should work to set option ifname &#039;eth0.1&#039; in the lan section of your /etc/config/network (and of course eth0.2 in wan).&nbsp; This will cause the port to emit 802.1Q tagged packets.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you very much for your answers.</p><p>@Antek<br />There is no switch built into my X86 laptop, on router hardware it&#039;s no problem to cofigure the switch via luci interface but I never tried it with OpenWRT terminal. I thought VLAN on OpenWRT can only be used with a switch.</p><p>@rj-45<br />There was eth0 as LAN client and a &quot;virtual&quot; network with static IP on eth0.1, the machine was connected to an OpenWRT router with 5 1000Mbit/s ports, internal switch and mwan3. It was possible to use the one connector for routing port-based over the several uplinks at the OpenWRT router and to provide a network/gateway for other clients over LAN or WLAN.</p><p>@mk24<br />After a couple of hours I simply tried to configure the interfaces in /etc/config/network and it worked. Now there is WAN eth0 and an additional LAN eth0.100 and both are online. The next problem is the routing between the networks, I have to work for it tomorrow.<br />As mentioned, I had no problem with OpenWRT on my router hardware but on the laptop with only one port it&#039;s a little bit to much for me <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
