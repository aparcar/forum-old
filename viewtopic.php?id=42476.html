					<p>Bump...</p><p>Does anyone have an insight on why this is happening?<br />From what i&#039;ve seen from other users with a 1043nd, a similar conf allows them to have Internet connection, although they were using backfire. There has been also some comments on some versions of 1043nd losing VLAN tagging, but that should be fixed with option allow 4k vlans. <br />Is 12.09rc1 still to imature to use in production?</p>									</div>

					<p>I was able to make TL-WR1043ND with two VLANs that are able to access Internet. I believe that you did not set your firewall properly. I used LuCI GUI to configure the system.</p>									</div>
