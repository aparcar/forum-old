					<p>Isn&#039;t this based on OpenWrt to start? Can&#039;t you just flash from the webGUI a new version of OpenWrt that is appropriate for your router?</p><p>I believe others have described serial recovery for the WDR3600/4300, which are very very similar devices. You should be able to follow those guides if that&#039;s the approach you want to take.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drawz</strong> on 11 Jul 2015, 22:12)</p>

					<p>@drawz&nbsp; yes it is based on openwrt but know the webgui is not enabled so it has to be done either serial or tftp and I am unable to get it into failsafe mode.</p><p>I have no idea why or if that has also been disabled.&nbsp; Just want to use this router and at this point it looks like its going to be a paper weight.</p>									</div>

					<p>@ tapper&nbsp; i have tried this over and over again.&nbsp; when the sun shaped light comes on i press the reset button and nothing happens the router just boots up normal.<br />i have tried all different timings to get it right and nothing changes. <br />the sun shaped led never flashes fast it just flashes the same speed no matter what i do.<br />nothing changes. </p><p>if i try and press it over and over again i get the symptoms i described earlier.&nbsp; i can ping it exactly 23 times regardless of what port im on or ip address i assign to my pc.</p><p>the network always shows an exclamation mark.<br />i have rebooted and tried nothing changes.</p><p>i cannot access this router no matter what i do.</p><p>i am waiting for the cable to arrive and hopefully someone will direct me to a guide for using it so i can try that.<br />I don&#039;t know what firmware i should try loading on to it either as i read about avoiding ones that say boot in the title.</p><p>At this point i would be happy with stock firmware just so i could use it.</p>									</div>

					<p>got it using this.&nbsp; but used gargoyle instead of original firmware!</p><p>was also getting bind error and it turned out that ms security essentials was the problem also.</p><p>1- Download original firmware TL-WDR3600 </p><p>2- Removed boot with hex editor, saved and rename firmware to wdr3600v1_tp_recovery.bin </p><p>3- Download tftpd32 version 4.50 TFTPD32 (is very important! if you have a firewall software, grants all permissions to tftpd32 and especially open port 69. </p><p>4- Change your PC/Laptop ip address to 192.168.0.66, Subnet Mask 255.255.255.0 </p><p>5- Connect you computer to the LAN port 1 on the router (WAN port won&#039;t work for this) </p><p>6- Open tftpd32, in TFTP Server select server interface 192.168.0.66 </p><p>7- Hold down the WPS/Reset button on the router. </p><p>8- Power on the router. </p><p>9- After approximately 7 seconds release the reset button. </p><p>10- In tftpd32=&gt;tftp server, in current directory, browse and select folder with firmware edit and rename (in step 2) </p><p>11- The router will now download the firmware from your server and upgrade.
