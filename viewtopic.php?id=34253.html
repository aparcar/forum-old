					<p>I flashed my TP-Link WR841 v7.2 with openwrt. The flash worked out well. After the flash I changed the password per telnet. When the password was changed I tried to log in per ssh. I get every time access denied and I’am really sure that I use the correct username and password. So it is not possible for to install web interface witch I need. Does any one has a good idea?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, maybe you need (i.e. Linux):<br /># ssh-keygen -f &quot;/home/yourself/.ssh/known_hosts&quot; -R 192.168.1.1<br />To clean any previous ssh-key over 192.168.1.1<br />Regards.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Almursi and fyi,<br />Í have tried both ways. Unfortunately both ways didn&#039;t work. By TelNet I always get access. By SSH I always get the response &quot;access denied&quot;. Whatever I try. How many times I change the password by telnet I still don&#039;t get access. Are there any other solutions to get access? Please help!</p>									</div>

					<p>try going in to failsafe mode (login through telnet with no password) then type &quot;firstboot&quot; and then try and login normally through telnet, without entering failsafe. type &quot;passwd&quot; which will set a new password for root. then login through ssh and install luci. that&#039;s what worked for me at least.</p>									</div>
