					<p>I&#039;m running CC on a WDR3600. Everything&#039;s fine but I&#039;m getting poor signal in the kitchen and I&#039;m looking for a solution.</p><p>Running a cable to the kitchen is not an option unfortunately so I&#039;ve considered Wi-Fi extenders and powerline devices. </p><p>I&#039;ve been told powerline is the easiest solution so I bought a cheap powerline+AP kit (TP-Link AV500) but I&#039;m returning it because web config *and* windows tool are not working. Moreover I need an extra switch just for it (no spare eth ports on the router) and I&#039;d rather avoid that.</p><p>Now I&#039;m reconsidering the wireless repeater option. In my case the ideal solution seem to be Atheros WDS, as described in the wiki. If I got it right I should buy an atheros device - preferably with two antennas - to be placed somewhere between the router and the kitchen. I&#039;ve seen there are cheap products made just for that (TP-Link WA-850 and the like). How good are these? I&#039;d like to flash it with openwrt so... should I be better served with a regular router? If so which is a good candidate?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>The WR841 is a good choice, it is practically the same hardware as the RE850 in a conventional router form factor-- as long as you get a v12 or lower.&nbsp; The new WR841v13 has MediaTek chips.</p><p>A dual band router would let you make the link on 5 GHz, saving bandwidth on 2.4.&nbsp; That won&#039;t be a big issue if your ISP speed is only DSL or slow cable though.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 25 Aug 2017, 16:29)</p>

					<p>I ended buying a TL-WR841ND (v10 for the matter). There were almost no alternatives as I wanted a cheap device, known to work with openwrt and with atheros Wi-Fi.<br />I just followed the Atheros WDS recipe and all worked as expected (speed is halved when devices connect to the extender).<br />So far I&#039;m happy with the setup.</p>									</div>
