					<p>Info: <br /><strong>OpenWRT (unknown) Kamikaze trunk+svn8216 ar7 linux 2.6.36</strong><br />CPU: arm7 (swp half fastmult vfp edsp neon vfpv3) 400 MHz, 2xLAN, Wi-Fi (rtl8192ce), USB.</p><p>Many packages are already installed (ProFTPD, Dropbear, DLNA, rtorrent etc).</p><p>Now I use kirkwood repository with --nodeps because opkg say: dependancy from libc* (I&#039;m not sure right now about name of lib)&nbsp; unresolved. From kirkwood I use just libncurses and screen util. <br />However, now I can install new packages but in installed list (after &#039;opkg update&#039;) I can&#039;t see old already installed apps. How can I fix it? (I have list of previously installed packages)</p><p>And general problem from LAN network I can succesfully connect to router by ssh, telnet, web, but from WAN ssh connection after some times (uptime 1-10 hours) and several connectons became not working. Also same with web connection. Ping still working after that. Why this happens? How I can analyze it and fix?</p><p>Also after reboot ProFTPD reset settings (saved in /etc/proftpd.conf) to default. How to avoid it?</p><p>Bad news for me I can&#039;t install new Backfire =&gt; router is not standard, not in supported devices list.</p><p>I hope somebody can help me with it. </p><p>P.S. Sory for my english.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ibmpc.maniac</strong> on 25 Mar 2013, 13:32)</p>

					<p>It&#039;s not serial router based on Cotina Systems Processor (ARMv7 with many extension) with USB port (support external 1 TB HDD) and mini pci slot for Wi-Fi adapter (Realtek&nbsp; 54m + 2 antenna). Also it have 2 LAN (100 Mb/s). It&#039;s manufactured in samsung I think. In box OpenWRT Kamikaze from trunk (now I can&#039;t say with version, maybe later when I have access to it).<br />I can post memory info/fdisk and what you need. It&#039;s have welcome banner: Cortina Systems G2. (Goldengate).</p><p>It works like this: Wi-Fi router + adsl modem in bridge mode. Also I have tp-link 740n (with last Backfire) but it useless without USB and have not too much memory.</p><p>Very interetng device for me. But I need help with settings and knowledge how to improve stability. I think because of hardware (drivers for wi-fi, cpu arch, config files and etc) I can&#039; install new OpenWRT =&gt; officially not supported device.</p><p><strong>How to analyze why it stop working correctly some times?</strong> </p><p><strong>Why ProFTPd ftp server after each reboot load default settings? </strong></p><p><strong>And how to refresh list of installed packages in opkg correctly? (Any tools/command for rescan?) Why opkg don&#039;t see any installed packages? </strong><br />I can&#039;t uninstall same of useless correcttly.</p><p>I have too much questions who can help me? I think some options need change because from local network it works prety good. rtorrent not realy stable I think, but ctorrent have not enough functionality, interface not friendly,&nbsp; don&#039;t know how to download 10-15 torrents simultaneously, only one. </p><p>Can I install rtorrent from kirkwood on old version? (I can&#039; uninstall it) If I install from kirkwood it&#039;s just overwrite files?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ibmpc.maniac</strong> on 26 Mar 2013, 08:39)</p>
