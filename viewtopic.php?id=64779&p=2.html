					<p>Great that you got it to work ok. Good reminder that sometimes you need to look at the actual config files when you are doing something as luci doesn&#039;t always cover all options.</p><p>I was looking at using 802.11s instead of wds to make it more robust and also to see what (if any) difference there may be in overheads.<br />I&#039;ve been slack with it as I&#039;m using a wr703n as a repeater and the 4M flash isn&#039;t big enough to install the required files and I haven&#039;t got around to creating a custom build for it to fit.</p>									</div>
