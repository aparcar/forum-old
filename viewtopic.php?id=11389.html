					<p>Hi, i&#039;m using EZ-ipupdate to update my public IP at dyndns custom service.</p><br /><p>I&#039;m using pppoe on Openwrt with a bridged modem. Openwrt is controling the pppoe session.</p><br /><p>Very often, after a power on, the Private IP adress is updated to the dyndns server instead of the Public IP adress.</p><br /><p>This is very annoying and need to be fixed.</p><br /><p>I&#039;m using EZ-ipupdate version 3.0.11b8-2 with Whiterussian 0.9.</p><br /><p>I wanted to replace EZ-IPupdate by DDclient, who seems more mature, but i can&#039;t get it to work with microperl. DDclient needs a full perl implementation.</p><br /><p>Does anyone got this problem with EZ-ipupdate ? And explain the cause of the problem ?</p><br /><p>Thanks for your help.</p><p>Olivier.</p>									</div>
