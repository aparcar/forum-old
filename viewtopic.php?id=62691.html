					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;ve bought a new TP-Link Archer C7 to extend my wlan range.<br />After some time, I&#039;ve setted up a new wlan which is extending my existing one, but it doesn&#039;t works as I wish.</p><p>The following I want to do:</p><p>[MainRouter, 192.168.1.1] is in my Room. In another Room is a second router [SecondRouter, 192.168.1.2], this router should be in the same network as the main router, connected trought the wlan to the main. On the second router, I&#039;ve installed OpenWrt. The second router should just extend the wlan from the first router. All request should be done in the same network, that means, I&#039;ll have access to all devices, like printers etc.</p><p>So my current configuration is:<br /><strong>Interface: Lan</strong><br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Protocol: Static Address
IPv4 Address: 192.168.1.2
IPv4 Mask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 192.168.1.1
Broadcast: 192.168.1.255
DNS: 192.168.1.1
(DHCP Server on second router is deactived)</code></pre></div><p>After this, I&#039;ve connected to my main router trought wlan with a new <strong>wlan interface</strong><br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Name of the network (standard value) wwan
Assign firewall-zone (standard value) wwan</code></pre></div><p>The second router is connected successfully to the main router.<br />If I&#039;ve a lock at the main router, I&#039;ve found a new device with the ip: *1.19, not *.1.2, why?</p><p>Okay, for tests, my pc is connected trought a lan port into the second router. And it works, I&#039;ve access to the internet. But if I look in the interface &quot;WWAN&quot; (connection to main router), there is also not the ip address *1.2, which I&#039;ve defined in the lan interface.</p><p>Now I&#039;m able to access the internet, but no devices in my lokal network.<br />What can I do, to solve my problem?</p><p>Thanks for helping <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>
