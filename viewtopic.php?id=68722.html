					<p>Hi! I have many models of AP to maintain and they are of different types - bgn, abgn and abgnac devices. I configured Jenkins to build all of firmwares in ar71xx Target System with Default profile. With bgn and abgn APs all OK. But for each AC AP I have to add additional build instructions which includes ath10k driver for each AC device. Is there any way to make build system to build firmware for each AP by its own profile with one make command or separtely build firstly (a)bgn and then abgnac devices?</p><p>Actually I could grep and awk over all Profile files to withdraw all available profile and then perform make for each of them in cicle. But this approach looks like a hack. And I suppose, the build system could done with tusk for my by itself.</p>									</div>
