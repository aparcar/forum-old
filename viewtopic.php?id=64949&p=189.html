					<p>Sir, I have no idea where you are coming from with those statements??<br /> &quot;told me so&quot;? Told me what? So far as i can read, you indicated that the radio functionality was already in by virtue of it being in 4.9 kernel. As I have clearly demonstrated above, this was not the case with images I have downloaded using links you and other had kindly provided. Im sorry. But it did not work.</p><p>My own programmatic analysis clearly showed that the <strong>CONFIG_MWIFIEX_SDIO=y</strong> option was not set and thus the neceesary <strong>.ko</strong> modules were not present when building/compiling the fw image on this platform. Anyone who claims to have the 3rd radio is either using a different image , a different chipset, or confused :-) After some digging and weeding, I managed to find a snapshot with the drivers in. I could have compiled them myself&nbsp; from source, into an <strong>.ipk</strong> and installed them, but why replicate Dave&#039;s good work?</p><p>In so far as patience, I am merely reporting as I go. If I go to fast for you, then sorry, but that&#039;s my pace, fast, determined, thorough, successful. I have posted a link to a fuctional 3rd radio image , above.</p><p>Yes! you are right, it is a great community. Lets keep it that way <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /></p><p>Indeed, I also seek EDNS so would be dleighted to exchange with you , Stubby setup/config/ideas .

					<p>Agreed. Snapshots , for some reason, do not all have the option set. Although I was led to believe the snapshots are daily botbuilds so if stable sets the option, so should snapshot.. But this is not what I found? Anyway, its working now and I have shared what needs to be set a build time to get support built in should&nbsp; the 3rd radio disappear in subsequent images.</p><p>By thew way , what have you updated in the driver? I could go through the code, but I&#039;m guessing you know (!) because 9.3.2.4 firmware is buggy , and I&#039;m guessing they are not &quot;your updated drivers&quot; but rather you have b/ported into your &quot;build&quot;&nbsp; as many are doing , kaloz being but one?<br /><a href="https://github.com/kaloz/mwlwifi/issues/256">https://github.com/kaloz/mwlwifi/issues/256</a></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>eduperez wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>My two cents about the third radio issue:</p><p>I have a WRT3200ACM running LEDE 17.01.4 plus my updated drivers (available at <a href="https://github.com/eduperez/mwlwifi_LEDE">https://github.com/eduperez/mwlwifi_LEDE</a>), and the third radio is fully functional.

					<p>For Those Who May Need GetDns and Stubby Packages For ( ENCRYPTED ) DNS OVER TLS</p><p>I uploaded ipk packages to 4shared here below:</p><p><a href="https://www.4shared.com/file/MQmjoryHei/getdns_130-1_arm_cortex-a9_vfp.html">https://www.4shared.com/file/MQmjoryHei … 9_vfp.html</a></p><p><a href="https://www.4shared.com/file/UVFVW1XPca/stubby_021-1_arm_cortex-a9_vfp.html">https://www.4shared.com/file/UVFVW1XPca … 9_vfp.html</a></p><p>My reason for doing this is because I noticed that some days these packages are available in Lede Snapshot Repo and on others they are not. So if you wish to grab a copy - store them locally - and then install via Winscp - you will be able to do so.</p><p>In case you missed the post for the instructions to get GetDns and Stubby working - I will add it again at the end of this post. I use Unbound for caching forwarded to Stubby&nbsp; / dnsmasq for DHCP - so it is speedy - no lag -&nbsp; &nbsp;see setup for that here -&nbsp; <a href="https://blog.grobox.de/2018/what-is-dns-privacy-and-how-to-set-it-up-for-openwrt/">https://blog.grobox.de/2018/what-is-dns … r-openwrt/</a></p><p>FOR THOSE INTERESTED IN GETDNS AND STUBBY FOR ( ENCRYPTED ) DNS OVER TLS</p><br /><p>iamperson347 aka cliobrando is the maintainer developer for these packages - He was kind enough to get back to me over on The Lede Forum&nbsp; thusly :</p><p><a href="https://forum.lede-project.org/t/help-n">https://forum.lede-project.org/t/help-n</a> … ls/11463/2</p><br /><p>Hello @directnupe</p><p>I helped put the getdns and stubby packages together, so hopefully I can help get them running on your device. (Note: There will be a few changes coming to the package defaults during the next release of getdns/stubby, as well as further explanation on the config choices that were included in the stubby.)</p><p>First, to answer your questions:</p><p>1 - No, there is no luci app yet<br />2 - There is currently no guide/etc. written up to get this working with lede/openwrt.</p><p>Assumptions:</p><p>1 - You have unbound or dnsmasq configured for your device, and it is the primary dns serving your network. (Or… at the very least, the unbound/dnsmasq config will not conflict with the default port currently set in the lede/openwrt stubby package, which is 5453.)<br />a) I recommend running unbound to utilize the caching. Sometimes the connections from stubby to the resolver can have a little but of lag, so caching + prefetch helps minimize the effects.</p><p>2 - You have a ca cert bundle installed on your router.<br />a) You can do this by running the following: opkg install ca-certificates</p><p>To get the packages to show up, you must subscribe to the correct feed. You can add the following to the “/etc/opkg/customfeeds.conf” file:</p><p>src/gz openwrt_packages <a href="http://downloads.lede-project.org/snaps">http://downloads.lede-project.org/snaps</a> … c/packages</p><p>Note: “mips_24kc” needs to be replaced with the proper instruction set for your device. You can find this info via the hardware table and then viewing “tech data” <a href="https://lede-project.org/toh/start">https://lede-project.org/toh/start</a></p><br /><p>Edit: for WRT 1200AC&nbsp; 1900AC Version 1&nbsp; 1900AC Version 2&nbsp; &nbsp;1900ACS Version1 or 2&nbsp; 3200ACM&nbsp; &nbsp;- this is correct feed in order to save you time and for the sake of accuracy -</p><p>src/gz openwrt_packages <a href="https://downloads.lede-project.org/snap">https://downloads.lede-project.org/snap</a> … /packages/</p><br /><p>Make sure the “openwrt_packages” does not conflict with any other feed you have.</p><p>Note 2: The snapshot feed (master) is the only branch where the packages currently exist. You will have to wait for the next lede/openwrt branch if you want to stick to release branches.</p><p>Note 3: When adding the snapshot branch, be careful with “upgrading” packages.</p><p>After you add the correct feed, run:</p><p>opkg update</p><p>After that, you should be able to install the packages:</p><p>opkg install getdns stubby</p><p>You can change the default resolvers packaged with the current package by editing /etc/stubby/stubby.yml</p><p>Note: There has been some discussions about the current defaults. I believe on the next release, I’m going to change the lede/openwrt stubby defaults to use quad9 non-filtering service: 9.9.9.10 and appropriate ipv6 equivalent.</p><p>The last step is to point you local resolver (unbound/dnsmasq) to stubby for name resolution.</p><p>For unbound, simply edit “/etc/unbound/unbound_ext.conf” and add the following:</p><p>forward-addr: 127.0.0.1@5453</p><p>OR</p><p>forward-addr: ::1@5453<br />(The lede/openwrt package of stubby currently defaults to listening on the loopback adapters only.)</p><p>Be sure to restart/reload your resolver afterwards.</p><p>To ensure stubby starts correctly after config file changes, please check the syslog after a restart of the service. You should see something similar to below (no errors reported):</p><p>stubby[24047]: [21:28:10.228569] STUBBY: Read config from file /etc/stubby/stubby.yml<br />stubby[24047]: [21:28:10.254679] STUBBY: Starting DAEMON…</p><p>Hopefully this helps.</p><br /><p>For those interested you can get Stubby from this custom feed for our devices&nbsp; -</p><p>src/gz openwrt_packages <a href="http://downloads.lede-project.org/snaps">http://downloads.lede-project.org/snaps</a> … /packages/</p><p>Lastly - Dave said that he will be adding GetDns and Stubby to his repo if they build properly in his next upcoming release</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>directnupe</strong> on 15 Feb 2018, 16:02)</p>

					<p>Ok this is really weird now. I got dnscrypt-proxy working again, by changing my ns1 resolver from &#039;dnscrypt.eu-nl&#039; to &#039;dnscrypt.nl-ns0&#039;. I dont know whats going on, but the logs say even with &#039;dnscrypt.eu-nl&#039; that it is connected, but it doesn&#039;t work anymore with this resolver. No host resolves anymore via that one. Also, this doesn&#039;t should happen really, because I have two backup resolver configured:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config global

					<p>@makedir I have noticed the exact same bug with unbound as nameserver, using 3 upstream dnscrypt-proxy&#039;s, in some cases unbound seems to get confused using multiple upstream servers, resulting in nxdomains for valid domains.</p><p>I also tested with dnscrypt-proxy2 but it seems the same resolving issue appears, I think it might be related to anti ddos measures at the dnscrypt server side. Or some strict dnssec validation proces.</p><p>Weirdest part is that it happens to me after a few hours and some domains fail to resolv in unbound but not in dnscrypt, which lead me to believe that a random request to a upstream dnscrypt proxy resulted in a nxdomain.</p><p>I will test soms more but this bug is really annoying</p>									</div>
