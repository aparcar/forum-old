					<p>1.&nbsp; It appears that there are 2 files contaminated with CRLF line terminator (DOS file format) in the SoekrisPort distributed by Nico.&nbsp; The files are (begining from directory OpenWrt-ImageBuilder-Linux-i686):<br />./image/tgz.mk<br />./image/x86/Makefile<br />Although I fixed those files but the image builder still generates two contaminated files (/etc/network.overrides and /etc/config/network) in the root image.&nbsp; Although this file contamination is not very serious but they cause the network not to be configured properly at booting time.&nbsp; I believe the contamination is also embedded in some files in the image builder.&nbsp; Could you please fix this.&nbsp; Thank you.</p><p>2.&nbsp; What parameters need to set to make OpenWrt boot and display through a normal console rather than through a tty port.&nbsp; This setting is for a standard x86 platform.</p><p>3.&nbsp; What dependent packages are for the &quot;prism54&quot; package.&nbsp; When I tried to insmod prism54, I had the following messages:<br />insmod: unresolved symbol request_firmware<br />insmod: unresolved symbol release_firmware</p><p>Thanks,<br />bluu</p>									</div>
