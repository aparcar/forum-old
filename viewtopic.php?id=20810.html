					<p>Hi,<br />I&#039;m novice to the field. I tried to set up a wireless lan with my Wrt54gl, and something went wrong I&#039;m not sure about. It seems that I logged out without setting correct IP addresses. Now when I connect the router (Kamikaze 8.09 installed) physically to my notebook and power the router on, first Windows xp tries to connect to it, then fails and writes:<br />&quot;Limitted or no connectivity...This problem occurred because the network did not assign a network address to the computer&quot;. <br />When I check for the Network Connection Details, it gives a physical address, an IP of 169.254.25.128 (auto-obtained) and a mask of 255.255.0.0. but Default Gateway, DNS server and WINS server are without any address. <br />Also, on the router panel it seems to be alright, DMZ is not blinking and the port Ethernet 1 is light on, as I am connected to it. It seems that my router now has no IP assigned to it right? I can not connect to it via browser too.</p><p>How can I solve the problem? <br />Thank you!</p>									</div>

					<p>Well I found out about failsafe! I powered the router on, then waited for the DMZ LED to light on, and for some 10 sec pushed the reset button (back of the device) and held. Then both DMZ and power LED started blinking together. I set the ip of my pc running Windows xp, to 192.168.1.2 and for default gateway to 192.168.1.1 (subnet: 255.255.255.0).</p><p>Windows xp: <br />Start&gt;Run&gt;cmd [Enter]. </p><p>at the prompt:<br />telnet 192.168.1.1 [Enter].</p><p>{I successfully logged on to the router. Then commanded }</p><p>at the prompt of the router:<br />firstboot [Enter]</p><p>after firstboot job done:<br />sync [Enter]</p><p>Then I turned the router off and on. After it booted again, I successfully logged on to the router <a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a></p><p>Hura!&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>
