					<p>Hi <br />I&#039;m tryin to understand wds so I&#039;m trying to set one up using some Ar9103 cards , there are some questions regarding it&#039;s setup, <br />in hostapd configuration file it&#039;s mentioned that it&#039;s only supported with driver=nl80211 and I&#039;m guessing I may be using ath9k (mac80211) for these routers (wr1043nd,g300nh,wr941nd). so are there any other programs that is going to handle this since I find nothing regarding wds in hostapd.sh ?</p><p>is it possible with using wds_bridge=wds-br0 force the wds to talk to other stations on wired network ? if they all operate on same channel I think that would be a good deal to make areas less crowded for each network with a better roaming.</p><p>thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>WDS handling is in mac80211.sh. Not sure what you mean with talking WDS on the wired network. If you have a wired backbone you don&#039;t really need WDS.</p><p>Maybe we have different ideas of what WDS does. In the mac80211/OpenWrt realm, &quot;WDS&quot; means 4addr mode for wifi, so you can bridge stations. It does not client roaming or seamless handover, that is doable with a wired bridged backbone, no need for WDS there.</p>									</div>
