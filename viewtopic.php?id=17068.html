					<p>I was thinking of a directory listing something along the lines of the downloadable images:<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/7.09/x86-2.6/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/7.09/x86-2.6/</a><br />and yeah I would think you either want the &quot;openwrt-x86-2.6-ext2.image&quot; or else you want the vmlinuz and ext2 files.</p><p>I have never tried it on X86, but some pages reference this:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/SoekrisPort">http://wiki.openwrt.org/SoekrisPort</a><br />which seems to go into detail on a lot of things like installing it onto a compact flash card</p>									</div>

					<p>Can you explain in more detail the setup you want?&nbsp; You have said you are using it on a x86 with a harddisk?&nbsp; Is this a desktop machine?&nbsp; Because if so, I am not sure that openwrt is necessarily what you want.&nbsp; However maybe other people on the forums will have a different answer.</p><p>As to the vmlinuz... that is actually the name of the kernel executable itself.&nbsp; The history behind the name (from wikipedia) is old unix systems were in /unix, then they were loaded into virtual memory so called /vmunix... Then linux took that name and called itself /vmlinux.&nbsp; The compressed version of a vmlinux is called &quot;vmlinuz&quot;, (z meaning zipped or compressed).</p><p>The way most desktop linux installations work is that there is a boot partition and a root partition.&nbsp; The root partition contains all of the files, and the boot partition contains the kernel and possibly a few other files.&nbsp; There is also a bootloader that runs in the &quot;boot sector&quot; or a partition or harddisk.</p><p>In the case of openwrt, no extra configuration is needed, and so generally the kernel itself is used as a partition, and the bootloader just jumps to that partition directly.&nbsp; Generally, openwrt is used on embedded platforms.&nbsp; And the way it supports them is by having compressed filesystems.&nbsp; jffs/squashfs are good for flash-based and ext2 is good for disk-based.</p><p>The linux &quot;file&quot; command will tell you the filetype of any given file that it knows about... so you can run it on each file to see what it says.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure since I have not looked much through the documentation, but I have a feeling that openwrt.image is the entire partition table included, where you can dd it directly to a disk and get a pre-configured partition table, bootloader, kernel and rootfs at once.&nbsp; vmlinuz is the kernel image, which can be by itself on the disk or installed with grub.&nbsp; The page I linked you to talks a lot about different methods of installation.</p><p>However, MAKE SURE you know what you are doing when installing it with dd... and that&#039;s why I wanted to know what your intent is when installing openwrt.&nbsp; If you just dd it onto a hard disk, it will OVERWRITE the partition table, and probably the superblock of any data partition on there, which will basically cause you to lose all data on your disk.&nbsp; I&#039;m assuming that is what you want.<br />dd will not warn you if you dd to the wrong disk or partition.&nbsp; So make sure you are using a disk which has no useful data.</p><p>There was a section on network boot (called PXE), and that might be a good idea to try out.</p>									</div>
