					<p>I tried using wpa_supplicant with my madwifi device, but wpa_supplicant said it didn&#039;t have madwifi support.&nbsp; In the SVN tag for Kamikaze 7.09, the config file for wpa_supplicant did indeed have madwifi disabled.&nbsp; I enabled it and recompiled, and after manually pointing wpa_supplicant to the madwifi headers, had a working package.</p><p>Did I miss something, or is the option really not enabled?</p><p>Was this changed in trunk?</p>									</div>
