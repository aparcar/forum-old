					<p>Hi.<br />I have been reading (and learning) about how to enable HT40+/- in ath9k devices. Seems that at this moment, there is not an official mac80211 release supporting this freature. You can enable HT40 for managed and mesh modes, but not for ibss (ad-hoc).<br />However exists a patch from Alexander Simon that seems in the future will be included in some release. I&#039;m playing with this. <br />So my idea of this post is to be a reference point for people who wants to try it, and also a disscusion to test and help the actual developing process.</p><p>To enable IBSS HT40 you need two patches. One for compat-wireless and one for iw. I have adapted both for the last version of openwrt source.</p><p>*compat-wireless-2011-04-19 -&gt; <a href="http://owrt.dabax.net/ibssHT40_owrt.patch">http://owrt.dabax.net/ibssHT40_owrt.patch</a><br />*iw-0.9.22 -&gt; <a href="http://owrt.dabax.net/iw_ht40.patch">http://owrt.dabax.net/iw_ht40.patch</a></p><p>So you need to checkout backfire source: svn co svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/branches/backfire<br />And put the patches in the correct place:</p><p>*compat-wireless -&gt; packages/mac80211/patches/002-ibssHT40.patch<br />*iw -&gt; packages/iw/patches/002-ibss_ht40.patch</p><p>And finally &quot;make menuconfig&quot; to configure the system (enable ath9k) and compile &quot;make V=99&quot; </p><p>Then boot new openwrt system and execute this commands to create an ad-hoc network with HT40:</p><p>iw wlan0 del<br />iw phy phy0 interface add wlan0 type ibss<br />ifconfig wlan0 192.168.2.X<br />iw dev wlan0 ibss join mynet 5200 HT40+ 02:CA:FF:EE:BA:BE<br />iwconfig wlan0 essid mynet</p><p>I will reply myself with the tests results I got</p>									</div>

I only have HT40 in one side.&nbsp; The connection is very instable, the bitrates are changing all the time. Also I in some periods I lost a lot of packets. <br />My bandwidth tests with iperf, scp and nc+pv shows only 20Mbit/s (at most). </p><p>I asked Alex, and he said that I should try to use minstrel_ht insteat ath9k_rc. But seems that the patches of mac80211 from openwrt are doing this.<br />Maybe there is another patch affecting the HT40 performance. I&#039;m going to dissable some patchs and see what happends.</p><p>Any idea? Any other tests with different hardware?</p>									</div>

					<p>Following the last test:</p><p>I have been playing a little.
