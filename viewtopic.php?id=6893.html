					<p>hello world!</p><p>i can get the white russian rc5 openwrt-brcm-2.4-jffs2-4MB.trx image to work without problems.<br />downloaded image from server, uploaded to my router with tftp, waited a few minutes, unpluged power, pluged in power, waited another minute, done. i can reach my router at 192.168.1.1 and it tells me how to mix a white russian. </p><p>my joy didn&#039;t rise too high when i found out, that this image can&#039;t too a lot. the root fs is mounted read only so i can only play around a litte.<br />in order to really get control over my router i want to build my own image. i got the buildroot-ng, read a few files and articles and got stated. the image builds fine but it simply won&#039;t boot. i use the brcm image and i tried a lot of things. i used the jff2-64k, jffs2-128k and squashfs images. always the same result ... which is no result.</p><p>i&#039;m pretty lost on all these pages and i couldn&#039;t find a thread reporting my problem.<br />how can i find out what i am doing wrong? where do i start?how can i figure out what i am doing wrong? </p><p>i have an asus wl500gp. the list of supported hardware lists this router.</p><p>thanks in advance for any help</p><p>quinn</p>									</div>

					<p>If you&#039;d take the time to read the manual, it would tell you that the jffs2 images are read only on the initial boot and require an extra reboot before they&#039;re writable, and also that we recommend using the squashfs images instead.</p>									</div>

					<p>i did read the manual.<br />the squashfs image doesn&#039;t work. only the jffs2-4mb works. the problem why i can&#039;t do &quot;another reboot&quot; is that when i reboot, the router goes back to diag mode and awaits a firmware. rebooting is a non trivial problem for me.</p><p>ok, fixed the reboot problem. the shell command &quot;reboot&quot; puts it in diag mode. i have to unplug power in order to &quot;reboot&quot;. still. that doesn&#039;t solve my problem with building my own image.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>quinn_eskimo</strong> on 15 Aug 2006, 22:49)</p>

					<p>while i still can&#039;t build my own firmware image i found out that i can build packages quite easily.</p><p>my initial idea was&nbsp; to use what others built before, so i wanted to build a firmware image before i try to build my own packages. i made no progres building a firmware so i just tried building a package. works perfectly.</p>									</div>
