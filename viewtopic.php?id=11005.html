					<p>I was wondering if Marvell 88E6060 switch is supported with 2.6 kernel?</p><p>Probably yes, as this switch is present on Compex NP18A boards - but will I be able to use VLANs (that is, to program each port independently, like one does with WRT54G and similar)?</p>									</div>

					<p>Support for this switch can not be done easily without horrible hacks in the ethernet drivers that need to use this chip. That&#039;s because the supposedly VLAN capable switch has NO support for 802.1q and uses a proprietary &#039;vlan trailer&#039;.<br />I&#039;m still thinking about whether it is actually possible to write clean code for supporting this crap.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hmm, that&#039;s bad.</p><p>Are there any small devices which:<br />- have ~5 programmable ports<br />- have 32 MB RAM or more<br />- have 8 MB flash or USB port<br />- have speed comparable to 266 MHz Xscale 42x or better<br />- don&#039;t need to have wireless</p><p>I want to build a fast, programmable switch with VLANs and OpenVPN.<br />WRT54G and similar with their mips CPUs are just too slow for LAN or even internet faster than ~2-4 Mbit.</p><br /><p>I thought that Compex NP18A would be a perfect candidate, as it supports up to 128 MB RAM, has USB, and a XScale CPU up to 533 MHz.<br />Moreover, the vendor seems to like the fact that these boards are supported by OpenWRT, which I consider an advantage, too.<br />From what you are saying, I won&#039;t do VLANs on these boards easily, so I have to find something else?</p><br /><p>WRV54G maybe? It seems to support VLANs in OpenIXP; but on the other hand, OpenIXP project seems dead.</p><p>Any other alternatives?</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I for one, are very glad you did! We are working on a box that has that very switch... <br />Soon as I can figure out how to get it into my kernel... I&#039;ll be glad to give you some feedback.<br />I am in the irc://freenode/openwrt-devel channel often... well 24/7 really. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
