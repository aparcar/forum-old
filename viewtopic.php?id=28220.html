					<p>Hi, i&#039;ve had oleg&#039;s firmware on my wl500gx with attached usb drive. Now I&#039;ve put openWRT firmware, but it wouldn&#039;t boot withnout the usb drive. Not even the LEDs blink until i put back the usb drive. I already tried put wl500gx-clear-nvram and wl500gx-restore.trx and it still act this weird. Actually I&#039;ve had even dd_wrt on it, because i couldn&#039;t upload openWRT firmware directly.</p><p>So, could anyone help me, or point me somewhere, to be able to boot without usb drive? <br />Thank you!<br />badluck</p>									</div>
