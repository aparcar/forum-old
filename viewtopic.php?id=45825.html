					<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>I just wanted to establish that it is possible to &quot;listen&quot; to youtube videos using mplayer in a TP-LINK MR3020 router.<br />This is not a post with a question about something then but rather an informative one. I thought it may be of interest to people using a router as a music player as I do. I didn&#039;t find anything specifically about mplayer-youtube on this device or other router actually, but luckily I found the qi-hardware project which is based on Openwrt.</p><p>I know it may sound odd to only listen to Youtube, but there are a lot of videos uploaded that are just music with still pictures.</p><p>For accomplishing it, I used the feed&#039;s definitions from: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>src-git qipackages git://projects.qi-hardware.com/openwrt-packages.git</code></pre></div><p>.<br />The branch used was AA. I had to tweak mplayer&#039;s Makefile a bit, but I don&#039;t know exactly what is that finally did the trick. <br />+libfaad2 +libffmpeg-full were added to the DEPENDS list and also --enable-x264-lavc and --enable-demuxer=FLV_DEMUXER as Configure arguments.<br />I don&#039;t know if all the changes are necessary but now it works.<br />It is necessary to add TARGET_CFLAGS+= -DFIXED_POINT to the Faad Makefile when building from AA feeds. I know that change is already in the feeds coming from trunk as an option in the menu. </p><p>After compiling and installing everything I installed python from the repos and then wget-ed the youtube-dl script.<br />I reused a cgi-ash script that I already had for controlling mpd and netcat + madplay, which in turn were being used for listening to Youtube through a much more complicated (ugly, really) setup involving a raspberry pi in another room doing the transcoding. The youtube API allow me to make a search and give me related videos and thumbnails. So from a WiFi-equipped cellphone it can all be controlled.</p><p>My scripts are really messy and ugly as I stop thinking after they do what I want. What I mean is they are certainly not efficient. I know some day I&#039;ll have to rewrite them all. Also, using python in such a small device is a bad idea because there is like a 20 second delay until youtube-dl gets the link from youtube and I think that could be much faster if it was written in C for example. Just loading python in console takes like 5 seconds in this device.</p><p>If, as I said, this is of interest to anyone and/or you have a question about it, please feel free to email me.</p><p>Cheers,<br />Guillermo.</p>									</div>

					<p>can you give detail how you got mplayer running.&nbsp; I compiled no error with AA branch and installed on my wr703n but when i run mplayer, i get Segmentation fault.&nbsp; I want to able to stream online radio with this.&nbsp; mpd cpu usage is very high and don&#039;t work well.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve lost my original Makefile and I can&#039;t recall where I&#039;ve got it from. I remember changing it, so that it uses the external libfaad2 -or something like that comes to my mind. Which Makefile are you using? </p><p>Anyway, I can tell you two things: <br />I never got a segfault with mplayer and I use AA.<br />And secondly, mpd should be less resource hungry than mplayer actually. Your problem might be related to other thing. Are those streams AAC&#039;s ones? Could you try listening to a radio that streams using MP3 (eg., <a href="http://tsfjazz.ice.infomaniak.ch:80/tsfjazz-high)?">http://tsfjazz.ice.infomaniak.ch:80/tsfjazz-high)?</a><br />I&#039;m guessing you don&#039;t have the fixed point flag enabled in libfaad2.</p><p>Cheers.</p>									</div>

					<p>mpd work great except it doesn&#039;t stream mms well especially wma.&nbsp; http stream consume around 5-10% cpu. <br />other user have the same issue <br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=153660#p153660">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 60#p153660</a><br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=106468#p106468">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 68#p106468</a></p><p>my though was the cpu was not fast enough so i tried on the pogoplug with ALARM.&nbsp; mpd cpu usage was 99%.&nbsp; Then i install mplayer on the pogoplug, all format work so great, cpu remain around 1% and audio come right on vs mpd need 5s wait.</p><p>maybe mplayer will work better with openwrt too.&nbsp; ok i recompiled and got it running.&nbsp; it work for most audio but wma.&nbsp; run into another problem Requested audio codec family [wmadmo] (afm=dmo) not available.</p>									</div>

					<p>You won&#039;t be able to decode wma on the wr703n, because it doesn&#039;t have a floating point unit. That&#039;s why cpu usage goes up so high. I suspect the pogoplug device (which I don&#039;t know) has one. Using a router with openwrt and mpd, you can listen right know, instantly, to a mp3, flac, ogg or aac (if you pass -DFIXED_POINT to the faad2 Makefile) file or stream. </p><p>There is a wma fixed point implementation (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-summer-of-code-2007-rockbox/downloads/detail?name=mike_giacomelli.zip&amp;can=2&amp;q=">http://code.google.com/p/google-summer- … n=2&amp;q=</a>) made for the Rockbox firmware, but no one has adapted it to openwrt yet</p>									</div>

					<p>thanks gsenna for the clarification.</p><p>I don&#039;t think pogoplug have floating point either, that explain mpd usage is also very high.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what mplayer have but it definitely work perfectly (I tried with debian and alarm OS on pogoplug).&nbsp; Too bad wma codec is not included with mplayer in openwrt.</p>									</div>
