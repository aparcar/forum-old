					<p>Dear all,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As you know, about one year ago, I said I would like to develop a true-friendly open hardware with openwrt installed. And now, my friends and I have almost finished it. We have done many tests and finished many demos. I guess you guys will be interested in it, and are wondering to know what it really looks like. For the information, you can access our website (<a href="http://www.intorobot.com">www.intorobot.com</a>). <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You are always welcome to tell me which OpenWrt version will be most suitable for the hardware. The hardware now is installed with OpenWrt BB.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Intorobot</strong> on 8 Jun 2015, 21:58)</p>

					<p>Broken website, Really?&nbsp; It is very strange, because I can access it quite well in Switzerland. Are you in US?&nbsp; </p><p>Thank you a lot for your suggestion, zloop. The support of WPAN in DD is very interesting.

					<p>Hi zloop, <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I also found CC already has the first Release candidate. That is awesome!<br />Does the CC RC1 support&nbsp; GPIO-PWM driver? We may need it, because a gpio-pwm-driven tricolor-led is now used on our hardware.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>zloop wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Your website is broken. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>Your video from the other thread is interesting.</p><p>The next OpenWrt release (&quot;DD&quot;, Kernel 4.x) will probably have WPAN support (its available but disabled in CC atm) which might be interesting for connecting/managing small sensor/actor &quot;clouds&quot; with 6lowpan and Bluetooth/IEEE802154.</p><p>maybe the wview package (or similar ones) might be interesting for your hardware</p></blockquote></div>									</div>

					<p><img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />. power consumption can be a critical factor for IoTs, and bluetooth will be a good choice. Yet the communication distance for bluetooth is limitted. Therefore, i think it depends on the practical applications to use wifi or bluetooth. </p><div class="quotebox"><cite>KHAN85 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Interesting idea.</p><p>if the target is using for IoT, what about bluetooth low energy support and power conssumption?.<br />I think IoT devices should have more focus in bluetooth than wifi.</p><p>I think that it should use a minimum distribution of OpenWRT for IoT appliances.</p></blockquote></div>									</div>
