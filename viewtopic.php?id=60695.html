					<p>My old dual band router decided to crap out over the weekend - it was being fed by a Cradlepoint router w/ Pantech UML295. I&#039;ve been using my Pi2 for occasional media center duties. I decided to give OpenWrt a go as I have installed it on some routers in the past (hate to admit, but my current router is running DD-WRT). </p><p>So I copied the image to my Pi2 and was able to get an IP on my computer and connect to the gui. I did some research and determined I would need to install several (about 50!) .ipk packages (wwan drivers, ralink drives, wpa_supplicant, etc. etc.). I used SCP to get these on the system then installed them. I was able to then add the aircard (eth1) as a WAN device. I then added a generic ralink 802.11N 2.4GHz adapter and had wifi. My next goal is to find a dual-band USB WiFi adapter that will work with the available .ipk packages.</p><p>I&#039;m at work currently, but if anyone is interested in getting an aircard working with their Pi2 I can reply later with the list of packages I installed to get this thing going.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
