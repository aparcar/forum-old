					<p>hey,</p><p>i&#039;m kinda new to linux, but i&#039;m getting there....</p><p>For the past few months, I&#039;ve wanted to get a large RC car, put a computer on it, and drive that around. But my motherboard, a MicroATX (22x22 cm) will only fit on **LARGE** RC cars, and I&#039;m kinda using it right now. But the router - what a great small, wireless, linux platform! And using the GPIO pins discovered by the developers of the SD card mod, that&#039;s the critical components that I needed. All I need to do is add a small driver chip like the SN754410. Its outputs would go to the motors and the inputs would be the GPIO lines. So all I need is a small script to read bytes from a socket and output to the GPIO lines.</p><p>I&#039;ve got the GPIO script to control the gpio lines. I got a sample socket script from <a href="http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue74/tougher.html">http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue74/tougher.html</a> . It runs fine on Slackware, but it gives either &quot;permission denied&quot;, or after I fixed that, i get unexpected &quot;(&quot; errors. Here&#039;s the telnet transcript:</p><p>@OpenWrt:/rccar# ./simple_server<br />/bin/ash: ./simple_server: Permission denied<br />@OpenWrt:/rccar# sh simple_server<br />simple_server: 1: Syntax error: &quot;(&quot; unexpected</p><p>It doesn&#039;t say &quot;root@OpenWrt&quot; because I added a password, then wanted to remove it, but it still would only run SSH; I renamed the passwd files /etc and now telnet works, but only displays &quot;@OpenWrt&quot; instead of root@OpenWrt.. whatever, it works.</p><p>To stay on target: The script uses some socket modules; in another post, I read that glib should have those and that&#039;s not the problem - it&#039;s just me. For compiling on Slackware I just use &quot;make&quot; or &quot;gcc -c&quot; - OpenWrt doesn&#039;t have gcc, so I have to compile on the PC and send it over (I have to get NFS working, too... right now, I put it on ftp and wget it on the router. must.. get...nfs... ). But I fear that gcc is compiling for my i686 (AMD Sempron).</p><p>Now to the real question: How can I force gcc to compile for a different platform? I just realized that I could check the &quot;man&quot; page - it says that &quot;-c&quot; removes linking. Could that be the problem? The man page for gcc is 8,778 lines long. I don&#039;t need a whole book on it; just one thing at a time - how to compile for a different platform.</p><p>Thanks for helping me out. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>flyashi</strong> on 30 Jun 2005, 03:44)</p>

					<p>Isn&#039;t there a way to run just one script without making an entire package?

Look at the thread I mentioned before or the source of some packages of OpenWRT, this is not as hard as you may believe.</p><p>If you really want to do it by hand, you first need to setup the cross compilation tool chain.

					<p>OK.... so if anyone is having similar problems, i got something to work</p><p>That &quot;something&quot; is being able to compile [mbm]&#039;s gpio program from source, and run it on the router! Well, it&#039;s a start. I&#039;ve tried about five times to compile openwrt, but it never finishes; this last time it got past the toolchain setup, so that worked. Using buildroot-documentation.html in the docs/ directory, I was able to get at least thus far.</p><p>The packaging Makefile still scares me a bit; and I don&#039;t need packaging. But compiling programs is really easy - run &quot;mipsel-linux-gcc -o outfile infile.cpp&quot; with /whrever/you/put/openwrt/staging_dir_mipsel/bin as part of the path variable (see the buildroot-documentation.html doc on how to do that). So that works!</p><p>I&#039;ve even managed to compile my own trivial program that prints &quot;vasya&quot; to the screen.</p><p>Next, I need to add sockets. Oh... fun. A very good tutorial on linux socket programming is&nbsp; <a href="http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue74/tougher.html">http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue74/tougher.html</a> but that&#039;s for c++ and I don&#039;t think that there is c++ support available for the wrt54g (i&#039;ve downloaded uclibc and glibc; i stil get &quot;can&#039;t load library &#039;libstdc++.so.6&#039;&quot; for c++ programs; c programs work fine. The linuxgazette article is for c++ - now i have to learn sockets for c!</p><p>&nbsp; - flyashi [@gmail.com]</p>									</div>

					<p>Not sure what -Wall does, but try using ipkg to install glibc and uclibc.
