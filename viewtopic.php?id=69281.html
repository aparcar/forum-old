					<p>It seems that the instructions on the how-to are outdated and that the usbip binaries from Attitude Adjustment are incompatible with the new kernel modules for Chaos Calmer. </p><p>I managed to compile the binaries myself, loosely following the instructions found in a blog post. (The board won&#039;t let me post the URL, unfortunately.) After manually copying them to the router, binding the device is finally working.</p>									</div>
