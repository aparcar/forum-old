					<p>Hi,</p><p>For some reason, when I use the &quot;Devices on Network&quot; function to scan my network, it runs for quite a long time, and then returns:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Bad Gateway
The process did not produce any response</code></pre></div><p>Sometimes it works as expected, but too often it fails with the above message. If I try to scan more than one network, it seems to always fail as above.</p><p>This is with Firefox 25, trunk builds of OpenWrt. I have two OpenWrt routers, and both are the same. Could it be some timeout in the browser?</p>									</div>

					<p>Bumping this topic. I&#039;m really not sure why this happens, but I guess it might be some timeout value in Luci. The scan obviously takes some time, and it appears that the error message appears more or less exactly 60 seconds after starting the scan. In other words, if the scan finishes within 60 seconds all is OK. If it takes longer, it fails.</p>									</div>

I&#039;m building from trunk, and I don&#039;t have my exact config handy at the moment.</p><p>Anyway, when the appropriate packages are installed, you will have a new menu entry &quot;Configure Diagnostics&quot; under &quot;Network&quot;, and also a new menu entry &quot;Devices on Network&quot; under &quot;Status&quot;.</p>									</div>

I&#039;m talking about a general network device scan (which includes wired devices). And also, I&#039;m running a pretty fresh trunk build, not BB.</p>									</div>
