					<p>Ok, I was looking through the old supported devices list and I found one router that was called &#039;Zyxel Prestige 660HW-61&#039; Now, is that the same router or similar enough to my router which is called &#039;Zyxel P-660HW-D1&#039; ? The router seen on the list had a status of &#039;untested&#039; I trust that means that the firmware can be installed but it has never been checked? I have put together a little info on my router so that it can be checked. I wasn&#039;t able to get much info so I took a picture for you and labelled it. I don&#039;t have a clue which part is which, I am assuming number one is the cpu though. I was told is might be Texas Instruments based, something about AR7? I am afraid I don&#039;t have a clue what that means but hopefully you guys can understand it! Any help would be so much appreciated, I can&#039;t tell you how much it means! So, please have a look:</p><p>1: <br />Infineon <br />PSB7200ZDW <br />99AHKVW </p><p>2: <br />0943PPR <br />V54C3128164VBI6 <br />P039974DHBRA </p><p>3: <br />Infineon <br />ADM6996I <br />AD 0934 <br />HA12924004X01 </p><p>4: <br />Infineon <br />PSB1350AZ6U</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/files/router_389.jpg" alt="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/files/router_389.jpg" /></span></p>									</div>

					<p>Well the reality is, nobody knows. And untested means nobody ever tried to flash it. The kernel will probably load but it might lack flash, ethernet, wireless support.</p>									</div>

					<p>Firstly, let me say how thankful I am to you for replying, I can&#039;t tell you how much I appreciate it! Now, I am more than happy to test this firmware, the only problem is, I am completely new to router hacking and have absolutely no clue how to install the firmware! I tried looking it up but am still really confused! Is there a GUI or is it all code based? So what you are saying is that the software will load but I won&#039;t get ethernet or wireless connection unless I am incredibly lucky...is that right? How would I connect to the router if this is the case? Thank you very much again for sparing a moment to help me, I will now continue to research, I am unable to get hold of the router at the moment as our new router won&#039;t play ball so the old one is in for this evening but I will do some research and try and figure out how to flash the firmware.</p><p>I hope you are able to continue to help,</p><p>Music Guy</p>									</div>

					<p>You would first build an initramfs image of the OpenWrt AR7 target, then attach/solder a serial cable onto the PCB to be able to communicate with the bootloader (probably ADAM2).<br />From there you would attempt to load the initramfs image with TFTP and see if it boots at all and if yes, how far and what peripherals are detected or not. Afterwards you might need to add board specific initalization code to the kernel to setup LEDs, GPIOs etc.</p>									</div>

					<p>To experiment with untested firmwares, you need at least a serial connection to your router. From the angle of the picture it cannot be seem if it has one, and where it is. Try to get us a better image, from the upside and underside. Also google/read about max3232 converters here in the forum. You will need one to connect the router to your computer and see what the bootloader is doing.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, thank you very much for replying and all the help, it looks like I have a lot of googling to do! I will try and get a better pic, I will have to find out what I am looking for though first. It isn&#039;t anything to do with those sticking up pins on the left of the chip labeled &#039;3&#039; or the holes on the right of chip labeled &#039;4&#039; is it? Will do some googling first though. Thank you very much for replying, much appreciated.</p>									</div>
