					<p>Hello everyone,<br />i have a quick question for a fairly weird issue, for sure i&#039;m missing some package</p><p>i have installed the aircrack-ng suite on my openWRT router, apparently every tool seems to work fine, the chipset is an ath9k and i can dump etc.</p><p>problem is that i would like to run some karma-like tests and for that i wanted to use airbase ng</p><p>whenever i try to start airbase-ng on the monitor interface i get this error:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p># airbase-ng mon0<br />error opening tap device: No such file or directory<br />try &quot;modprobe tun&quot;<br />error opening tap device: No such file or directory</p></blockquote></div><p>apparently it can&#039;t start the tap interface.. but i can&#039;t seem to figure out how to install the tap interface, i have installed openvpn on the router so i&#039;d say all the dependencies were in place, but apparently it&#039;s not.</p><p>any help is really apreciated.</p><p>thanks</p>									</div>
