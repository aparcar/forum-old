Maybe I&#039;m off topic, but the problem is that the mpd write error at startup:<br />root@OpenWrt:~# mpd<br />Failed to bind to &#039;127.0.0.1:6600&#039;: Address alredy in use</p><p>My Settings in /etc/mpd.conf</p><p>music_directory&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;~/music&quot;<br />playlist_directory&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;~/.mpd/playlists<br />db_file&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;~/.mpd/database&quot;<br />log_file&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;~/.mpd/log&quot;<br />bind_to_address&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;localhost&quot;<br />port&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;6600&quot;</p><p>Tried to change the ports, but it does not give results.<br />MPC adds internet radio and losing, but if you make a withdrawal information through telnet, he writes:<br />root@OpenWrt:~# telnet localhost:6600<br />OK MPD 0.16.0<br />Connection closed by foreign host</p><p>My /etc/hosts<br />127.0.0.1 localhost</p><p>Help please, who met with it.
