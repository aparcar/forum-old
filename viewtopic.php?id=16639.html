					<p>Hi, apologies if this is the wrong forum.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking for some vlan capable switches but would prefer to run openwrt than some generic firmware.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t tell from the supported devices which might do this and of course people&#039;s opinions on which devices are worth using are important.</p><p>So, does anyone have any recommendations for an openwrt based 8 port GigE router/switch?&nbsp; No wifi needed and don&#039;t really need (or want) firewalling in this case either.&nbsp; </p><p>Thanks,<br />-P</p>									</div>
