					<p>*** 31.08.11 EDIT:&nbsp; solved - Going back to Stock ROM isn&#039;t a problem at all. You can use the LUCI-Web-UI ***<br />But seems there are a few WLAN-connection problems with the actual Build (Snapshot of 22-Aug-2011). So OpenWRT on a WA901ND is really useless at the moment. Hope it will be fixed soon.</p><br /><p>--<br />I have a lot of connection troubles with the latest Snapshot (http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wa901nd-v2-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin - with the snapshots before I had the same issues).There are always +-5 devices connected and from time to time devices lost connection or can&#039;t connect.</p><p>Is there a howto to revert to the original stock ROM?<br />I&#039;ve read I have to take an image with &quot;-boot&quot; in the name, but couldn&#039;t find any.</p><p>Thank you for every answer helping me this issue or giving me hints to go back to the stock rom.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>thewho</strong> on 31 Aug 2011, 16:16)</p>

					<p>Nobody an idea?<br />ok, maybe fixing the WLANproblem itself?</p><p>When I&#039;m using OpenWRT the connection is sometimes very slow and at a point I can&#039;t connect anymore.

					<p>EDIT: ok, going back to Stock ROM isn&#039;t a problem at all. You can use the normal ROM from the TPLink-Homepage (at the moment wa901nv2_en_3_12_6_up(110214).bin).<br />Don&#039;t know why it didn&#039;t work the first time. Maybe I had to reset first.</p><p>After going back to the Stock ROM all connection-problems were gone. So it seems to be really a problem of OpenWRT.</p>									</div>
