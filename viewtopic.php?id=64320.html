					<p>So as I dive back into OpenWRT I&#039;m curious as to why we have a wan6 interface. Is it solely so we can specify a different protocol for address assignment? In otherwords:</p><p>option proto &#039;dhcp&#039;</p><p>and</p><p>option proto &#039;dhcpv6&#039;</p><p>I see in the IPv6 wiki post that if I had both a static IPv4 and a static IPv6 assignment I could do it all in 1 interface. If this truly is the reason it sounds like we need a proto&lt;4&gt; and a proto6 option so we can use a single interface to deal with the different protocols instead of having extra interfaces to confuse muggles like myself.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>Its because of netifd architecture.<br />One logical (netifd) interface supports only one way of external configuration.<br />Internally netifd is very limited in configuration possibilities and it relies on external scripts in /lib/netifd/proto.<br />One script for one protocol, one protocol for one interface. Need another protocol - use another logical interface for the same physical device</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the reply bolvan. Based on your reply I could go either way; a virtual interface per protocol or an interface with protocol independent configurations (like a cisco router).</p><p>I wonder if that could be placed in the IPv6 wiki for those of us coming from different architectures? I know I was confused by it.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
