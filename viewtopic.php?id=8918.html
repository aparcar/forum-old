					<p>Hi!</p><p>I was wondering if anybody has any suggestions how to set up buildroot-ng to do openwrt-specific development, e.g. I want to add a package to openwrt that is not a port of some existing software but rather a project from my own svn repository that is only (or almost only) meant to be an openwrt package.</p><p>I&#039;m familiar with how the package/ system is set up (and I love it), but I&#039;m a little uncertain how to bend it to build software that is not really a port. One way would ofcourse be to make a tarball from my repository source and use that for an openwrt package, but I&#039;m a little woried about the &quot;turnaround&quot; build time for that (e.g. change my package source in my repository, build distribution tarball, touch openwrt package makefile, build openwrt) and loosing automatic dependency management.</p><p>A solution where dependencies are tracked by make all the way from my project source files to the openwrt .ipkg (or flash image) would be fantastic!</p><p>Any suggestions?</p><p>Thanx in advance!</p>									</div>

If it&#039;s absolutely necessary I&#039;m willing to take the route via a tarball that lives in the local filesystem; if the tarball has been updated (built by a separate build rule) then package xyz is out of date and needs to be rebuilt.</p><p>Anybody who can point me in the right direction?</p>									</div>

					<p>We don&#039;t really expect the source tarball to change at all. It is downloaded from an upstream site and patched if necessary.
