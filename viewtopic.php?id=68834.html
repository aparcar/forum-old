					<p>HI Everyone,</p><p>I have Binatone WR1500n v2 router. I was looking for a custom firmware for it, I have used Openwrt on my other routers &amp; really like it.<br />H/W specs are:<br />a) chipset : Atheros AR9331<br />b) Flash : 4MB<br />c) RAM : 16MB</p><p>Looking at device wiki, circuit board for binatone looks exactly like TP-Link TL-WR741ND v4.3, except RAM is of different size.</p><p>Please if someone can help or point in right direction.</p>									</div>

					<p>Flash size is coded into the firmware, but RAM size is auto determined at boot, so you don&#039;t have to modify it for different RAM.&nbsp; If you get into the bootloader via serial, you could manually flash a WR741 or generic firmware, it may work.&nbsp; You probably want to use an older version and custom build to take out as much stuff as you can.</p>									</div>

					<p>mk24 : Thanks for the reply.</p><p>OK, so Flash size &amp; Chipset determines the fimrware to use. Now I have to do the following<br />a) get into bootloader via serial : I don&#039;t have any serial cable, probably have to create one &amp; solder. Is there any other way, web upload? I have the original firmware, if I can do some comparison &amp; tweak via Hex editor?<br />b) Find a custom build for WR471 : do you mean like Gargoyle or some thing else, sorry I couldn&#039;t find any custom rom. if you can help.</p><p>Thanks so much, I see inching toward the goal.</p>									</div>

					<p>You WILL need a serial cable to muck around with an unsupported model.&nbsp; No way around that.</p><p>By custom build I mean using the image generator or fully compiling an image yourself.</p>									</div>
