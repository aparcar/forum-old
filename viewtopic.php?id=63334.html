					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a WNDR3700v1 that I&#039;ve been running the latest DD-WRT on, and I&#039;d like to overwrite it with OpenWRT.&nbsp; I thought it would be easy - just upgrade through the web interface.&nbsp; But I have tried both the factory image and the upgrade image of OpenWRT, with no success - router reboots into DD-WRT.</p><p>Not sure what&#039;s going on with the router except that within 1 sec of clicking on &quot;upgrade&quot;, the connection resets and the router reboots back to DD-WRT.</p><p>Images I&#039;ve tried:<br /><a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-15.05-ar71xx-generic-wndr3700-squashfs-factory-NA.img">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal … ory-NA.img</a><br /><a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-15.05-ar71xx-generic-wndr3700-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal … pgrade.bin</a></p><p>Thank you for any assistance,</p><p>Charles</p>									</div>

					<p>Did you try the method of copying the openwrt image to the /tmp directory of the dd-wrt firmware-ed router and then Telnet or SSH into the router command line interface to use the command &quot;mtd -r write openwrt.bin linux&quot; where openwrt.bin is the name of the firmware?&nbsp; &nbsp;It takes a while for it to load.</p><p>If you need a way to copy and are a windows user, you should go into dd-wrt and enable SSH.&nbsp; &nbsp;This will allow you to use the Windows app&nbsp; WinSCP.&nbsp; With it you can define a session to the IP of your router, using the SCP option (say YES to allow the certificate)&nbsp; &nbsp;It opens up a Windows-like directory structure of your router where you can view file contents there or copy files back and forth between windows and&nbsp; your router via Windows drag and drop.&nbsp; &nbsp;With this method you would download the OpenWRT firmware to windows and use WinSCP to open the router directory /tmp and drag and drop the firmware to that folder (directory) on the router.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>From there you would use either Telnet (if not found, go to Control Panel, Programs and Features, turn Windows features on and off, enable Telnet) or via SSH (install Windows app Putty to define a SSH session) to get a command prompt accessed on the router and then you would enter:</p><p>cd /tmp<br />mtd -r write openwrt.bin linux</p><p>Noting that openwrt.bin is the name of the file you copied to /tmp</p><p>Your lights will start to flash on the router and eventually you should be able to get to Luci.&nbsp; &nbsp;If nothing has happened, wait at least 20 minutes before you begin working with the router if you don&#039;t want to brick it.</p><p>Note: The web interface of dd-wrt is where you turn on and off the ability to use Windows apps like PuTTY for SSH or Windows telnet/PuTTY telnet to access a router command line interface.</p><p>Warning:&nbsp; If you edit files that will be placed on a linux system like your router, be sure to use an editor like Windows free app ConText or the native editor that comes with WinSCP.&nbsp; &nbsp;Never use Windows Notepad to edit a file and will be copied to a Linux system.</p><p>******* UPDATE: The method is device specific; this method I have used is suggested for some Buffalo models.&nbsp; &nbsp;Use at your own risk.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>DonJuane</strong> on 13 Mar 2016, 18:11)</p>

					<p>Thanks for all this info.&nbsp; I saw anomeome&#039;s response first, and that seemed the most straightforward.&nbsp; Thought about copying openwrt to /tmp, etc (DonJuane&#039;s description), but to be honest, I have a hard time separating which methods apply to which firmwares.&nbsp; Strangely, I could not get ssh to operate *at all* on this unit.</p><p>Anyway, restoring to factory wasn&#039;t too difficult, and I now have OpenWRT installed.&nbsp; I started configuring it and now I have new troubles, which if I can&#039;t figure out, I&#039;ll be asking again for help... :-)</p><p>Thanks a lot!</p><p>Charles</p>									</div>
