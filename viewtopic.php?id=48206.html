					<p>So I have a TP-Link850RE range extender with OpenWRT on it. I have it up and running connected to my Linksys AP. It works connecting from the a client (laptop connected to TP-Link) through the AP to the internet. But I can&#039;t see other computers connected to the AP directly. I&#039;ve set it up using this video since I use the LUCI GUI and not config editing. </p><p>But then I&#039;ve had trouble making it a &quot;dumb AP&quot; by turning off the DHCP and firewall to make it a transparent pass through...which is what I assume I need to do to get the clients connected to the TP-Link integrate with the main AP network. </p><p>Any suggestions on how via the LUCI GUI to make it a dumb AP?&nbsp; I&#039;ve edited the LAN profile to turn of DHCP and Firewall and un-set the checkbox for the &quot;Authoritative DHCP&quot; .</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks. <br />Tried changing the AP connect to a WDS client. That seems to drop the connection to the main AP. not sure my TP-Link chipset can handle WDS. Looks like broadcom&#039;s is the only one that works according to that post above. Mine is Atheros. I&#039;ll keep poking around.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks much for the great/informative summary. It would have taken me a ton of research to figure all that out!</p><p>So in the end, my dad had an extra Cisco M10 he wasn&#039;t using. I did have a hard-wired Ethernet port in a decent location so I hard wired the extra router and setup as an extender. So this also allows full speed over wifi versus the half-speed with the wifi-based extender. And I don&#039;t lose any functionality. I set it to the same SSID on a different channel and seems to work really well and is stable. I could never get the TP-Link stable with the same SSID. </p><p>Luckily my home builder pulled cat5 for the phone jacks and used only two of the wires for phone. I converted the jacks to Ethernet outlets and put a switch on the home run point to connect them all. </p><p>Thanks much!</p>									</div>
