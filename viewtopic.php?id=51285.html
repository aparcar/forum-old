					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have got android tether to the WAN port of my TP-Link WR1043ND v1 up and running. I can access sites and it seems to all work fine.</p><p>The problem is that my phone provider has a ridiculously low tethering limit despite my unlimited data plan. I can tether my laptop directly to my (non rooted galaxy S4) phone and using clockworkmod tether and PIA VPN can tether without my phone provider being able to detect tethering and thus block it. However because connecting to the 1043ND requires me to use the stock android tethering app instead of Clockworkmod, if I use the android PIA VPN app it blocks the connection. I need some sort of way to use android tether on the WAN port of my router while behind my VPN.</p><p>Is there any way to either not use the stock android tether app with openwrt (rooting my phone maybe?) or to somehow have a VPN connection running? I thought about trying to install openvpn on my router but I don&#039;t think that would prevent the android tethering app registering tethering. Also when I had DD-wrt (&#039;i switched to openwrt today because the android tethering process was so much simpler) with openvpn on the router my internet connection was ridiculously slow so I would prefer if another device like my phone or a raspberry pi could handle the VPN.</p><p>I&#039;m currently living in temporary accommodation so have no way of installing internet and thus must use my phone. I&#039;m gonna be here for 8 weeks so anyone that could help me would be a life saver! I wanna be able to access the net on all my devices not just my laptop!</p><p>I&#039;ve searched everywhere and there seems to be no-one who has android router tethering working with a VPN.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Dave,</p><p>I was only assuming that tethering with openwrt failed with clockworkmod tether because of what I had read online and the fact that my connection failed if I used that but worked if I used the stock android tethering app. I suppose it&#039;s possible that the VPN on my phone was messing with things though.</p><p>Yeah I had a VPN anyway so in this case was just using it to hide my tether usage - from what I understand about clockworkmod and the like is that it changes the headers and other info so that it hides your tether usage anyway - I just thought VPN might make me &quot;doublely safe&quot; if that makes sense - can I just not use the VPN then?</p><p>I&#039;m not at home until tonight so I&#039;ll post that info then.</p><p>Thanks for the reply, be back in touch soon!</p><p>Cheers</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Dave,</p><p>Sorry I misread your first message - you&#039;re saying it works with cyogenmod? (I read it as clockworkmod sorry!).</p><p>So you&#039;re saying that it should in theory work if I root my phone?</p><p>Will post that other info tonight.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi mate,</p><p>No worries. Just out of curiosity what do those commands do? (Just generally, no need for massive explanation). Are they likely to help?

					<p>Mate, </p><p>Well done for getting the tethering working!</p><p>Now all you need to do is set up the VPN tunnel, either on the Android smartphone, or on the router - depends which is easier for you.</p><p>To be honest, I am not sure if the VPN is going to help - your provider will see the large amount of traffic, and see that you&#039;re using a VPN &amp; put 2 and 2 together... </p><p>Anyway, PIA seems to use (amongst other technologies) OpenVPN, and both Android &amp; your OpenWrt router support that.&nbsp; Your choice as to which runs teh OpenVPN client is up to you.&nbsp; At the very least, you should be able to stick with the non-rooted S4 (use it&#039;s built-in tethering) , and use OpenVPN on the router!&nbsp; Just ask PIA for your client configuration file.</p><p>look at: <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/client-support/">https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/p … t-support/</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zxdavb</strong> on 28 Jun 2014, 21:29)</p>

					<p>Hi man,</p><p>Thanks, pretty happy to get it all working (especially since I accidentally bricked my router last week and was worried i&#039;d have to buy a new one but managed to save it!)</p><p>So, using my non-rooted S4 and the default android tethering app I can get the mobile data to work with the router. Issue is that my network can detect my tethering usage so my ridiculous 2GB monthly tethering limit will run out in just a few hours of usage.<br />When I connect to my VPN (PIA OpenVPN app) the default tether app doesn&#039;t work any more. From what I&#039;ve read online this seems to be a deliberate feature of android blocking VPN usage when tethering.</p><p>When just using my laptop, phone and ClockworkMod Tether (not using the router) I can tether my laptop to my phone fine, use the VPN and my network provider can&#039;t tell i&#039;m tethering (have used about 25 - 30gbs no issue - 2gb limit doesn&#039;t count down). From what I&#039;ve seen using this method I don&#039;t think I actually need to use the VPN as ClockworkMod Tether seems to change some use agent settings so that the network carrier can&#039;t detect tethering. As I&#039;ve got the VPN though I just use it, extra security is always good!</p><p>So ultimately what I need to identify how to is the following:</p><p>I need some way to use an alternative android tethering app than the default one that comes with android as this is the way that my network are detecting tethering. If I can tether to my router using an alternative then I&#039;m sorted!</p><p>If having a rooted phone could enable this then that&#039;s fine as I could use my old rooted S2 instead. Issue is all the apps I&#039;ve found for rooted tethering seem to be geared towards providing wifi tethering and that&#039;s not what I&#039;m after.</p><p>Do you have this or does your CyanogenMod setup still use the default tethering app from android?</p><p>As a potential alternative I thought I could try to install ClockworkMod Tether to my spare raspberry pi running Raspbian, tether man phone to that and then somehow connect the pi to the router - dont even know where to begin with a setup like that so I&#039;m hopeful can do it all using my phone instead.</p><p>I&#039;m SO close to having this all working - final push now! Massive thanks for the help so far mate - it&#039;s nice to see that the OpenWRT community seems a bit friendlier than DD- WRT.</p><p>Cheers</p>									</div>

					<p>awesome, so it seems using the default tethering app on my rooted S2 doesn&#039;t register with my network provider so I have my phone running quite happily running my entire network including my NAS, laptop and 2 tablets. Happy days.</p><p>Now just to get openvpn configured (android app still blocks internet tethering for some reason even on my rooted phone) on my router and i&#039;m done </p><p>Cheers</p>									</div>
