					<p>Hello, </p><p>We are small company from Bulgaria (Eastern Europe) and we are developing a hotspot system based on Chilli, so we need some routers with openwrt installed firmware with Chilli included. For several months we&nbsp; have been trying to find a set of compatible routers for a long term but the problem is that routers&#039; makers are releasing new versions of their products which is very different according to the old versions of the same model and result is - bricked router. <br />After discussions we have made a decision - we need openwrt pre-installed routers so could you help us?<br />Do you sell routers with openwrt or could you tell us some router models with openwrt?</p><p>Kind regards, <br />Velly.</p>									</div>

					<p>Seems you can buy some at <a href="https://store.jpgottech.com/shop/">https://store.jpgottech.com/shop/</a> (I am not familiar with this site, but they do list supported OpenWrt versions). They offer very old versions though.</p><p>Support for most Atheros-based routers is excellent, as long as new router revisions don&#039;t add hardware incompatibilites they are usually supported once any changes are documented. What manufacturers have you looked into? Aside from their models sold only in China, TP-Link seems to be very reliable in terms of hardware revision compatibility.</p>									</div>
