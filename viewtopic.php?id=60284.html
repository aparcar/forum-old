					<p>I have a TP-LINK WR841N V9 Wireless-N router, and accounts with the <a href="https://www.tunnelbear.com/"><span class="bbu">TunnelBear</span></a> and <a href="https://www.privatetunnel.com/home/"><span class="bbu">PrivateTunnel</span></a> public VPN services. I&#039;m interested in setting up the WR841N to act as a <em>client</em> for either of these services, so that all devices on my home network — or better yet, only specific local devices that I designate — or better still, only certain local devices communicating with certain remote hosts — will have their traffic routed thru the public VPN service rather than the open Internet. What is the best way to achieve this functionality with the OpenWRT firmware installed?</p><p>Although my use-case is for public VPN services, this same configuration would be useful for those who wish to connect their home router as a client gateway for a private VPN, such as that provided by an employer or an educational institution.</p>									</div>

					<p>You have some homework to do<br />This article is to set up a server, but is one of the best written.<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/openvpn-streamlined-server-setup">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/openv … rver-setup</a><br />Go to the upper right and type OpenVPN into the search box.</p><p>A quick look at your providers indicates that neither are set to use OpenWRT.&nbsp; PrivateTunnel is OpenVPN, so if you install their config on a PC, you can grab the CONFIG.OPVN file and have a good start for converting this to the file to use with OpenWRT as a client.&nbsp; It&#039;s unclear what VPN TunnelBear supports.</p><p>You need to install 2 files, OpenVPN-openSSL and luci-app-openvpn to have the gui.&nbsp; Some dependencies will also be installed.<br />If you are on Windows, you will want WinSCP to make editing the Openvpn config file easier.</p><p>Separate the which user goes where from the equation until you have both systems working for all clients.&nbsp; Note, you will probably want to turn one off while you are using the other.&nbsp; It&#039;s a separate exercise that I have never done.</p>									</div>
