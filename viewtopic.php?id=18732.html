					<p>phisically speaking, it&#039;s impossible to add a new port on RB433 and RB433AH, which are basically the very same hardware, except from higher clock and RAM and MicroSD slot. Besides that, they are pretty the same.</p><p>as there are no USB ports, it also impossible to add some easy and cheap USB-Serial adapter ...</p><p>i have NEVER used those Ethernet-Serial adapter, just like:</p><p><a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=180306753982">http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?Vi â€¦ 0306753982</a></p><p>but they exist. it would even make possible to control a serial equipment far from the RB433 box.</p><p>tough ... i dont know about OpenWRT support for these devices, as securely some software must be installed to emulate Serial-&gt;IP thing to have this working. On the controlled device i think there&#039;s no need to configure anything different, the device will think it&#039;s &#039;speaking&#039; serial. But the controller device must emulate the Serial-IP to get this working.</p><br /><p>i really dont know if this will work or will be possible to use on OpenWRT ...... but seems one of the few options you would have <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
