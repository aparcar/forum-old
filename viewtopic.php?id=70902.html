					<p>I have just been thinking if there is any way to use 2 flash chips one with the stock firmware and one with openwrt on and a switch to select between them. Is it just as simple as isolating the power to each chip ?</p><p>Thanks Nikki x</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes you can just switch the chip select lines (pin 1 on an 8 pin SPI flash).&nbsp; The other 7 pins are connected in parallel.&nbsp; You need pull-up resistors so that the chip that is switched off stays unselected.</p><p>I have done this to install larger chips.&nbsp; Solder a new chip on top of the old one, except pin 1. Use serial console on the bootloader to copy the bootloader into the blank new chip. Then I removed the switching arrangement and permanently wired the new chip to select, and CS of the old chip to 3.3 volts.&nbsp; &nbsp;The wires can be moved use the old chip as a backup if needed.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 13 May 2017, 19:13)</p>

					<p>That picture is a very strange way to do it.</p><p>What I did was connect the board CS to the arm of the switch.&nbsp; Each chip connects to one end of the switch and also has a resistor to +3.3 volts.&nbsp; So the chip that is switched on has a direct drive of CS from the board, while the one that is switched off has its CS pin pulled up to 3.3 volts by its resistor.&nbsp; The board is also driving the resistor of the active chip, but that is not going to affect it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 13 May 2017, 22:21)</p>
