					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have looked everywhere for help and have not been able to find any. I just recently bought a Buffalo wzr-hp-ag300h and tried using the stock dd-wrt firmware but does not work for my needs. I have flashed it with the latest attitude adjustment trunk and successfully got samba working to access my usb drive. But the issue I am having is that when I transfer a file to the usb drive I get 455KB transfer with samba 3x or 895KB with samba server 3.6. I see everyone else get 5MB wireless and 10MB plus wired. If anyone can help would be great or point me in the right direction would be just fine. I have all information below if more is needed please let me know. </p><p>router = Buffalo wzr-hp-ag300h<br />firmware = latest attitude adjustment trunk dated 02/29/2012<br />software = samb3x or 3.6 <br />followed samba how to including not tracking ports 137-139 and 445 <br />I have tried formatting usb hard drive to ext2,et3, even ext4</p><p>If I use stock buffalo dd-wrt or user friendly firmware I get 14.5MB wired and 8.25MB wireless. Again any guidance or help would be grateful. </p><p>Thank you</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kernel</strong> on 1 Mar 2012, 14:41)</p>

					<p>Snk, first off thank you for your help. One question regarding your suggestion. I use the luci mount tab to mount my drive, do I still access the fstab config and change it there or just change the option in the luci interface tab. </p><p>Thank you again for your help.</p>									</div>

					<p>Changing it in the luci interface changes it in the configuration file as well (and vice versa). Use whichever you like.</p>									</div>
