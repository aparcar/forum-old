					<p>Hi, I am new to OpenWrt and LuCI. I know them because I&#039;m using the <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardYun?from=Main.ArduinoYUN">Arduino Yun</a> board that makes use of them.</p><p>I have a strange problem with a unexpected loss of connection over the Ethernet (I don&#039;t face the same problem over the Wi-Fi since it is automatically set as client when I join a Wireless network). That is, when I start Arduino Yun then it works as expected and the connection through Ethernet works; after a while (approximately between two and five or ten minutes) the connection stops to work and in order to solve the problem I must manually access the LuCI panel, go to the Network &gt;&gt; Interfaces menu and click the &quot;Connect&quot; button on the right side of the &quot;WAN eth1&quot; row present in the page. Making so the Internet connection is re-enabled and it starts working again but after a little more I have the same problem, again. To solve the problem I must repeat the above actions again and again.</p><p>I don&#039;t know what is exactly the problem but, maybe, it is related to the DHCP lease process. Can someone help me to set the system in order to properly work as a Ethernet client through the LuCI interface?</p><p>If you want more information ask me and I&#039;ll try to give you those.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>speaking</strong> on 18 Apr 2014, 22:17)</p>
