					<p>Hi,</p><p>My apologies - I have found this somewhere before, but I have searched long and hard now ... and can&#039;t find it anymore ... :-(. It&#039;s me, but I just can&#039;t find it - dang it!</p><p>I have sort of bricked my router (programming OpenWRT, wrong nvram size it seems) - programming the flash I have messed up the board id (board_data). I have fixed this in the past, by reading, modifying and writing back some of the flash (mtd), but I can&#039;t find how to do this any more. Does anyone have any info on this? And is it the nvram partition (mtd)?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the help! Between this and some poking around I have fixed the issue - at least temporarily. It seems that when I load OpenWRT on my router, it overwrites / destroys the board_data ... :-(. I can repeat this, and it happens reliably. If I manually write the board ID back to the start of the correct partition, things work again - but I shouldn&#039;t have to do this.</p><p>I have manually (and locally) modified the code to recognize my board, but the partitioning is still messed up - or at least, it destroys the board data, which is not good. Is there a way to fix this?</p><p>Thanks again.</p>									</div>
