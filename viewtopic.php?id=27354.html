					<p>HOWTO: Transparent TOR proxy</p><p>Using Openwrt as tansparent proxy to the TOR-network.</p><br /><p>This project has been on my mind since a long time. <br />I wanted to set up a free hotspot and share me broadband-connection, but I wanted to do it in a secure manner. I just want to avoid the police knocking on my door because someone did something &quot;bad&quot; using my hotspot. The best way I could come up with, was routing the traffic of the hotspot trough the tor-network <a href="http://www.torproject.org/">http://www.torproject.org/</a>. <br />This has two advantages: <br />Traffic is routed encryted trough the tor-network and reaches the net through an tor-exitnode, and there is no way to tell that the packets came from my hotspot. <br />A client connected to my hotspot doesn&#039;t know anything about my networkstructure, my real ip, etc. so it provides more privacy for me. </p><p>I use a transparent proxy setup because I want to use a simple setup, especially for the user. A new client gets an IP-Address through DHCP, and can use the net. No need for any additional setup.&nbsp; <br />So that&#039;s why I&#039;m doing it, but I guess there are lots of other situations where a transparent tor proxy can be usefull.&nbsp; <br />info about Tor:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.torproject.org/">http://www.torproject.org/</a> <br />info about the transparent proxy feature of Tor: <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TheOnionRouter/TransparentProxy">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/to â€¦ arentProxy</a> I set up an &quot;Anonymizing Middlebox&quot;</p><p>Setup:<br />I used a wgt634u with a recent backfire-svn checkout (r24007) it&#039;s a broadcom chip and I run a linux-2.6 kernel. I guess the stable backfire-release and any other architekture should work too but your router should have at least 32MB RAM (my tor-daemon needs about 13MB RAM) and enough Flash (8MB are enough).<br />I use only the wifi (&quot;ath0&quot;) interface with own firewall-zone &quot;tor&quot; and restricted the access to the dhcp-server and tor-proxy only. But it will work with &quot;br-lan&quot; as well.</p><p>You need to install the tor-package (available in the official openwrt-package-repository) and you need iptables-mod-nat and iptables-mod-nat-extra for the iptable-rules in /etc/firewall.user</p><p>so here are the relevant sections of my config files: </p><p>/etc/conf/network:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface tor
