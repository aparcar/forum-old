					<p>Really thanks for your message. </p><p>Ok I saw I&#039;ve already the package &#039;iptables-mod-ipopt&#039; installed. </p><p>1) - In LuCI I have a section called &#039;personalized rules&#039;. In this section it says I can write on the &#039;/etc/firewall.user&#039; file, which at the moment looks like this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># This file is interpreted as shell script.
# Put your custom iptables rules here, they will
# be executed with each firewall (re-)start.

# Allow forwarding from/to VPN interface
iptables -A forwarding_rule -i ppp+ -j ACCEPT
iptables -A forwarding_rule -o ppp+ -j ACCEPT

# Allow IPSec encrypted L2TP packets
iptables -A input_wan -p udp -m policy --strict --dir in --pol ipsec --proto esp -m udp --dport 1701 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A input_wan -m policy --strict --dir in --pol ipsec --proto esp -j REJECT</code></pre></div><p>Can I copy that code into this section?</p><p>2) - Do I have to restart some daemon to take these modifications effect?</p><p>3) - If instead I have ssh access and I would like to send a command to immediately shut down the connection and then restart it again for a specific static IP. What would that be? </p><br /><p>Really thanks in advance.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Garret</strong> on 21 Dec 2012, 22:10)</p>

					<p>This is a useful thread, but it really should be stated that all of the above times are UTC!&nbsp; Maybe this wasn&#039;t the case then, but it is now.</p><p>There is a way around that by using this switch as part of the extra arguments:<br />--kerneltz</p><p>However, the manual states that its use is &quot;highly discouraged.&quot;&nbsp; That passage is quoted here along with the advice that the router itself be set to UTC to avoid other potential (unnamed) problems:<br /><a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/508231/what-is-the-kerneltz-in-iptables-command">http://serverfault.com/questions/508231 … es-command</a></p><p><strong>Is it generally a good idea to have the router on UTC?&nbsp; Also, in OpenWRT&#039;s case, will kerneltz be wrong half the year?</strong>&nbsp; It&#039;s right this time of year, at least.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>The caveat with the kernel timezone is that Linux distributions may ignore to set the kernel timezone, and instead only set the system time. Even if a particular distribution does set the timezone at boot, it is usually does not keep the kernel timezone offset - which is what changes on DST - up to date. ntpd will not touch the kernel timezone, so running it will not resolve the issue. As such, one may encounter a timezone that is always +0000, or one that is wrong half of the time of the year. As such, using --kerneltz is highly discouraged.</p></blockquote></div><p>Update (Nov 2015): --kerneltz seems to no longer work as of late builds of CC. Just use UTC times.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rseiler</strong> on 10 Nov 2015, 21:34)</p>
