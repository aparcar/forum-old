					<p>Hi everyone!</p><p>At work we need ssh-access from the outside. To try and make this more secure, we monitor failed login attempts and should these occur frequently and the attempt be from an area where we do not expect any logins from (like east Asia), we block the IP range. This way we have quite a list of IP ranges that are always denied by the firewall and thus don&#039;t even get a chance to log in.</p><p>Currently we have an IP-Cop running our firewall. The machine (standard PC hardware) is getting a bit old, is rather bulky and uses quite a bit of electricity (compared to a standard router), so the wish is there to replace it. I am currently working on an OpenWRT box (TP-Link WDR4900), which I want to configure so it does pretty much the same things as the old firewall.</p><p>My problem is configuring the IP ranges. This is not going to work within LuCI, I am pretty sure of that. I don&#039;t have any objections to using config files though, I just hope LuCI doesn&#039;t remove that configuration I create within the files if I change something trivial using LuCI.</p><p>In the firewall config, there is a parameter for defining IP ranges (iprange) and a link to ipset(8). Somehow, I just don&#039;t understand how to actually work with that. Is there some other documentation on this subject that I might understand? Or is there someone here who would care to explain the concept?</p><p>Example:<br />I want to block<br />10.0.0.1 - 10.2.5.255<br />192.168.5.1 - 192.168.20.255</p><p>I know these are not public IPs, I just want to avoid that someone takes offence to me managing to include his IP in my example. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>The old firewall was configured using fwbuilder. I tried this with OpenWRT but failed miserably. For one, the newer (current) version of fwbuilder finds issues with my settings (like telling me that rule 5 would never apply because 4 rule already caught the some packets, although rule 4 and 5 apply to different hardware-devices). Even after removing all the rules fwbuilder complained about, I never got a configuration to work, meaing I was cut off from the net, which is a bit too much protection. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> I thought about copying just the rules for blocking the IP ranges, but I haven&#039;t tried that yet.</p><p>Can someone give me a push in the right direction here, please?</p><p>Best regards,<br />Chris</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Gullytrotter</strong> on 25 Aug 2015, 17:47)</p>
