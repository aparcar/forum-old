					<p>Hi</p><p>I have got WEP working fine but I tried to switch to WPA and failed msierably <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" />&nbsp; I used ipkg to install NAS and configured WPA through the web gui. I then rebooted the box but it won&#039;t work. The XP PC thats the client just sits at the trying to aquire address part of connecting for ages then gives up. There is an S41wpa in /etc/init.d so I guess that loads nas, is there anything else I need to do ? I tried looking at the NVRAM variables and manually set </p><p>wl0_akm=&quot;psk psk2&quot;</p><p>but that didnt seem to help. I am using AES for encryption, any pointers gratefully accepted.</p><p>PS its a WRTG54 v2.0</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>its a Linksys Wireless-G adaptor. XP thinks it should support WPA and AES. The driver date is 2004 though so maybe there is a newer one, I&#039;ll check.</p>									</div>
