					<p>Hi OpenWRT devs and users!</p><p>Short version: dnmasq 2.73rc6, which ships with Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 r48532, has a bug in it that causes a crash, and I&#039;m wondering whether I should build my own version of CC, wait for a new CC image, or start using a nightly snapshot.</p><p>Long version:</p><p>I recently upgraded to Chaos Calmer, and I decided to add some DNS-based ad blocking to make my home network browsing experience smoother.</p><p>Fast forward a few days - my wife and I notice that our network will occasionally &quot;crash&quot; - we can&#039;t open new connections, and new devices can&#039;t connect to the network.&nbsp; Unsurprisingly, when I log onto the router I discover that dnsmasq has crashed, so I start it back up and everything works again.&nbsp; After some investigation, I was able to determine that it has something to do with empty AAAA records that are also present in my adblock blacklist - the problem is present in the dnsmasq included in Chaos Calmer (2.73rc6) and is fixed in dnsmasq 2.76 (specifically commit 41a8d9e).</p><p>(End Long Version)</p><p>So now I&#039;m at a bit of a crossroads - I would like to maintain my ad blocking setup, but I would also like dnsmasq to stay running.&nbsp; I see there haven&#039;t been any new releases for Chaos Calmer since it first came out, but I&#039;m a little nervous to use a nightly snapshot since they&#039;re experimental and I would prefer something more stable.&nbsp; Should I just build my own image of CC with some patches to dnsmasq, or should I just bite the bullet and move up to nightly?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
