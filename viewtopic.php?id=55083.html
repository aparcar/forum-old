					<p>Hi all. I just typed out a great long thing and then it failed to post. So. eh?</p><p>I need a bit of help setting up my raspberry PI B+ as a gateway on my network that runs a squid caching server and possibly QOS.</p><p>I know a fair amount about networking but my linux skills arent up to scratch. My current gateway is a virtual machine running an OS called &quot;brazilFW&quot; that has everything I want in an easy to configure web ui.</p><p>After much messing around I finally loaded: OpenWrt Barrier Breaker 14.07 / LuCI Trunk (0.12+svn-r10530)<br />onto my PI B+ and am able to access the web GUI. Further messing around meant I successfully mounted a 80GB hard drive that I intend to use as a cache disk for squid.</p><p>I failed to get my wireless dongle working, but that&#039;s not nessasary for my current setup. I&#039;d just like to be able to cache content transparently using the PI that is running openwrt, so I don&#039;t need to leave my virtualbox running permanently.</p><p>If someone could help me configure my openwrt/PI to act as a gateway that does transparent proxy cache thingy that would be great. My current easy-to-use squid OS thingamabob has these settings:</p><p>Cache memory size: 100Mb<br />Cache size on disk: 40GB<br />Max memory object size: 7.4MB<br />Max disk object size: 3.7 GB<br />Hide proxy: yes<br />Intercept: yes</p><br /><br /><p>Ive poked around in the squid.conf file within openwrt after (I presume) I installed it using the package manager, but I&#039;m clueless on what should be set or unset, or if I need firewall rules to forward port 80 traffic to the squid port.. or even how to do any of that on openwrt.</p><p>My Openwrt/PI will be at 10.0.0.7/24 (all hosts use this as gateway)<br />My Actual Modem on the network will be at 10.0.0.4/24 (only squid/openwrt uses this as gateway)</p><p>Any help would be appreciated, Thanks greatly.</p>									</div>
