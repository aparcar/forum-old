					<p>Remember that you always install a new firmware on the other partition, and then boot from it. If you want to install a new version of LEDE, just do it from the OEM partition; it should overwrite your current installation and then boot into it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Like eduperez says, the router always flashes the other partition. Both in OEM and in LEDE/Openwrt.</p><p>Note that you don&#039;t need to use the &quot;break boot 3 times with power off&quot; trick to switch boot partition without flashing. You can do that by software with both Openwrt &amp; LEDE and also with the OEM firmware. </p><p>* Linksys original OEM firmware offers the possibility to boot into the other firmware: &quot;Restore previous firmware&quot;. It is named a bit misleadingly, but in the context of two firmware partitions it means the switch to the other partition. </p><p>* In LEDE &amp; Openwrt, you can use either simple u-boot env variable modification commands or a script. One script is e.g. the function used by sysupgrade script: <a href="https://github.com/lede-project/source/blob/master/target/linux/mvebu/base-files/lib/upgrade/linksys.sh#L5">https://github.com/lede-project/source/ … ksys.sh#L5</a> <br />Both variants are visible in the script below, but in principle just <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>fw_setenv boot_part 2
fw_setenv bootcmd &quot;run altnandboot&quot;</code></pre></div><p>or the respective commands to switch to the partition 1.</p><p>I use a script modified from that LEDE/Openwrt sysupgrade script:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
#
# This script changes the router to boot from the alternative kernel/partition.
#
# Normally partition is changed at firmware flash. New firmware is flashed
# to the other partition and then the router boots from there. This script
# causes that boot partition change without a flash

cur_boot_part=`/usr/sbin/fw_printenv -n boot_part`
if [ &quot;$cur_boot_part&quot; = &quot;1&quot; ]
then
    echo &quot;Switching to kernel/partition 2&quot;
    fw_setenv boot_part 2
    fw_setenv bootcmd &quot;run altnandboot&quot;
elif [ &quot;$cur_boot_part&quot; = &quot;2&quot; ]
then
    echo &quot;Switching to kernel/partition 1&quot;
    fw_setenv boot_part 1
    fw_setenv bootcmd &quot;run nandboot&quot;
else
    echo &quot;Error: unexpected value: boot_part=$cur_boot_part&quot;
fi

# auto_recovery should have been set to &#039;yes&#039; by /etc/init.d/97linksys_recovery
# the same script has also reseted the boot-counter used by u-boot.

fw_printenv auto_recovery</code></pre></div>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 18 May 2017, 10:58)</p>

					<p>Thanks a lot for the responses.&nbsp; I was able to perform an install of the latest LEDE firmware for WRT3200ACM (rango) from the Linksys OEM partition.&nbsp; The router then rebooted into the new LEDE partition.&nbsp; I will stay on the LEDE partition and see how stable Wi-Fi is on the latest LEDE.&nbsp; This was a major reason for going back to OEM.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you are going to run LEDE on the WRT3200, I would recommend you to follow this thread and install the latest wifi driver: <a href="https://forum.lede-project.org/t/pre-compiled-updated-mwlwifi-drivers-for-stable-releases">https://forum.lede-project.org/t/pre-co … e-releases</a></p>									</div>
