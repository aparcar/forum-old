					<p>Have you looked into this link<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/block_mount">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/block_mount</a></p><p>also I noticed you did something with adding squashfs and was able to do some reset, how was you able to do that? I&#039;ve been using chaos calmer x86 for a year and decided to do a reset to defaults since i have a new provider and wanted to go back and start over, but if there no practical method i could just do this manually, backup and restore this manually.</p>									</div>
