					<p>&lt;bg info, skip to problem, if desired&gt;<br />Newb here. First of all I would like to thank everyone for all their contributions to this awesome project. I am learning a ton and love playing around with hardware and command prompts. Soon I am going to start going to school for computer engineering so I hope to contribute more to these projects instead of only taking. I have a D-link dir 601 and a bad wan port. I used to have dsl internet and my dsl modem had the option for me to allow it to issue ip&#039;s and I had my router just putting out the wireless signal. Well, when I switched to cable, the stupid motorola has no options for configuration and I&#039;m having all sorts of issues. I can&#039;t get my network printers to respond and I can only connect one device to internet at a time. (I previously had modem going into lan port)<br />&lt;sorry if tmi&gt;</p><p>So I would like to reconfigure an unused lan port as WAN. Is this possible? according to <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=16148">this thread</a> it&#039;s possible in openwrt, but my config doesn&#039;t appear the same.</p><p>mine is as follows:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>config &#039;interface&#039; &#039;lan&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ifname&#039; &#039;eth0&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;type&#039; &#039;bridge&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;static&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ipaddr&#039; &#039;192.168.1.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;netmask&#039; &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />config &#039;interface&#039; &#039;wan&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ifname&#039; &#039;eth1&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;dhcp&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />config &#039;switch&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;name&#039; &#039;eth0&#039;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;reset&#039; &#039;1&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;enable_vlan&#039; &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />config &#039;switch_vlan&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;device&#039; &#039;eth0&#039;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;vlan&#039; &#039;1&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ports&#039; &#039;0 1 2 3 4&#039;</p></blockquote></div><p>Thanks in advance for any and all replies.

					<p>UPDATE:<br />After making the changes recommended and rebooting, I cannot get back into the modem through ssh and I&#039;m not getting an IP address to log back on, so I&#039;m guessing some change I made was bad. I also learned that changing the config file and rebooting apparently solidifies the changes <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>I&#039;m learning, but if I don&#039;t find a little success with this, I might just break down and buy a new router <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>

					<p>FINAL UPDATE:<br />Okay, Not sure why it didn&#039;t work the first time, but what you said in your first code was exactly what did the trick. Thanks so much! I learned that I did need the 0.1, 0.2 as this specifies vlan (new info for me, not anyone who knows what they&#039;re doing) and port 4 is indeed lan port 1. I had fun learning. Now I have a functioning router <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
