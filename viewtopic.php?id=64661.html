					<p>I&#039;m having quite a bit of trouble flashing OpenWrt to a cheap MyNet N600 (<a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/wd/n600">here&#039;s</a> the wiki page).</p><p>I&#039;ve tried flashing by both methods mentioned in the wiki: uploading the firmware over a web interface, and connecting via telnet and installing with fwupdater.&nbsp; After completing either method, the power LED turns solid for 30-40 seconds and then turns off.&nbsp; I have left it on for ~30 minutes, continually pinging it, but it doesn&#039;t come online.</p><p>When flashing via fwupdater, it gives an error at the end (although the wiki page says to ignore it): <br />No more seama header to be read</p><p>Can someone who has OpenWrt working on the N600 give me a different/more detailed method for flashing it?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>codetheweb</strong> on 6 May 2016, 02:01)</p>

					<p>Hi try this file first and then flash to openwrt if you stil want to.<br /><a href="http://www.gargoyle-router.com/downloads/images/ar71xx/gargoyle_1.9.0-ar71xx-generic-mynet-n600-squashfs-factory.bin">http://www.gargoyle-router.com/download â€¦ actory.bin</a><br />I flashed mine from the WD Emergency Recovery. <br />Here on the openwrt wiki for the n750 it says.<br />For some reason releases after 15.05.1 (trunk) doesn&#039;t seem to be working correctly in recovery mode, it accepts the file but doesn&#039;t boot. Upgrading afterwards using sysupgrade works fine </p><br /><p>I don&#039;t no y WD stopped making routers I really liked the n600 and the n750.</p>									</div>
