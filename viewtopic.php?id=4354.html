I have a 400-gig USB-2 drive.&nbsp; So the idea with a nice portable drive is that it&#039;s easy to move around, yes? So sometimes I might unhook and couple it directly to a PC where it&#039;s convenient to copy a large amount of data. Let&#039;s face it, having it on the NAS device is convenient, but there&#039;s time when you want more speed.&nbsp; Especially as slow as current Samba 2.x is.&nbsp; So if I needed to backup a lot of documents on the laptop it might be easier to hook up the drive directly, copy files, then move the USB-drive back to the NAS for general usage.&nbsp; Of course right now I can&#039;t do this anyways, because FAT wasn&#039;t working for me with large files so I had to switch to ext3 to get it to work at all. But if FAT or NTFS gets worked out I would like to move back to a more portable setup.</p>									</div>
