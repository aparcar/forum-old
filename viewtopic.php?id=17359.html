					<p>Testing the latest SVN revision (12993) on a WRT54GS with the b43 free driver (with enough success to get a WPA2/PSK as well as a &quot;no encryption&quot; association), I came accross a strange problem...</p><p>Each time I activate the wlan0 interface, &quot;WLAN&quot; green led (between &quot;DMZ&quot; and &quot;Port 1&quot; ones) lights up just for one instant, but is immediately shutdown, and then, the orange and the white leds from the &quot;Cisco&quot; logo continuously light up... does this have a particular meaning ?</p><p>&quot;dmesg&quot; seems to indicate the driver is loaded with debug information, some of which seems to be about this led (says it is &quot;registered&quot;, and it effectively appears in &quot;/proc/diag/led&quot;) : </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>b43-phy0: Broadcom 5352 WLAN found
