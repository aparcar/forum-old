I tried to install openWRT and the same hapens. In openwrt you first have to enter a password and none works (I can&#039;t do that because it always says that it was unable to change password file)</p><p>I tried to install the official version of the firmware but the same problem appears... can&#039;t login anyway...<br />I tried to install again dd-wrt and it seems to work nice.. but when I change to another firmware it&#039;s login still doesnt work (and the wireless ssid is set as dd-wrt)</p><p>my question is:</p><p>is there anyway I can solve this? maybe a nvram clear (I don&#039;t know what this is but I saw it somewhere)</p><p>I really need this asap</p><p>PLEASE GUYS I would be very thankful to you guys.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks guys</p><p>I was able to solve this problem<br />Aparently dd-wrt now uses a new encription thing and when u put another firmware that thing goes crazy.<br />the solution is to install the firm u want and after u put it turn it off and turn it on. then press restore button for about 30s a light will start blinking. after those 30s u just have to turn it off and on again and it will work perfectly</p><p>Thank u all.. U all saved me a couple of bucks</p><p>regards and keep up the good work</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>holla</strong> on 24 Jan 2007, 21:52)</p>
