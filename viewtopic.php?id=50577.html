					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;ve followed <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient</a> and have a working relayd bridge now.&nbsp; The bridge is much better than the one I replaced with stock firmware, but it&#039;s still not stable and seems to require a reboot every day or two.</p><p>The &quot;head end&quot; access point is a D-Link DIR-655 which cannot run open source firmware due to a proprietary chipset.</p><p>I&#039;m curious how stable people have found relayd bridging to be in practice.&nbsp; I need uptimes of a month or better.&nbsp; I had very similar problems - the bridge just Stopped Working - with the proprietary unit I replaced, although it was much more frequent.&nbsp; I&#039;m wondering if I&#039;m dealing with bugs in the DIR-655&#039;s firmware - if most relayd bridges are stable, that&#039;d give me a clue.</p><p>I have a Rosewill RNX-N360RT with RP-SMA connectors.&nbsp; I&#039;m considering replacing the DIR-655 with it if OpenWRT runs properly on the RNX-N360RT (allegedly a rebranded TP-LINK TL-WR941ND v2 and the firmware UI sure looks like a crappy rebrand job).&nbsp; I need RP-SMA connectors on the head end because it&#039;s a point-to-point link using directional antennas.&nbsp; Just wondering if relayd is known to normally be quite stable, or not, before I put tons of work into seeing if Barrier Breaker will work right on the RNX-N360RT yet or not.</p>									</div>

					<p>I use a TP-Link WDR4300 as a wireless bridge with relayd. I bought it in January, and built an image based on r39403, and I had an uptime well over two months, and the bridge had passed more than 1.1 TB of traffic. If I hadn&#039;t rebooted it to upload a newer trunk image I&#039;m confident it would still have been running, it never stopped working on its own. It&#039;s currently running r40540, and seems just as stable to me.</p>									</div>

					<p>Cool. Well, if I eventually replace the DIR-655 (proprietary) that the DIR-615 is bridging from, and/or improve radio reception (sometimes it seems to disassociate and then be unable to re-associate), time will tell I guess.&nbsp; If I swap out the DIR-655 and the problem disappears, I&#039;ll have isolated the guilty party.</p>									</div>

					<p>For the record, the AP my WDR4300 connects to is an Asus RT-AC66U (don&#039;t know the firmware version, as it belongs to my landlord). I use the 5GHz radio to connect to the AC66U, and the 2.4GHz radio as an AP for my own devices, in addition to Ethernet.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah, we&#039;re using scavenged/used hardware so I have a DIR-615 connecting to DIR-655 for point-to-point on 2.4GHz channel 1, then in the remote building, the access point is 2.4GHz channel 11 in the center of the building, connected by ethernet to the bridge.</p>									</div>
