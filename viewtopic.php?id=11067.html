					<p>Hi, </p><p>im using a UMTS USB Modem with Openwrt (Modem: Huawai E220). It connects without problems to vodafon i can also establish a stable vpn connection with it.</p><p>Following problems occur:</p><p>using wget for some page (like checkip.dyndns.org) gives a content-length is garbage error. looking at the tcp connection with wireshark shows that the connection stops before all the content is transmitted.</p><p>since there is only a problem with tcp connection the problem might be in the tcp configuration.</p><p>would be nice if anybody could give me a hint.</p><p>thanx</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>im using Whiterussian 0.9. <br />But i dont think there is a problem with the usbserial since the connection is established at the point the problem occurs.<br />While trying the wget <a href="http://checkip.dyndns.org">http://checkip.dyndns.org</a> (which gives the content length is garbage error) i do have a working vpn connection other umts in parallel which doesn&#039;t show any problems at all. The problem also occurs only on a couple of websites for example <a href="http://www.yahoo.de">www.yahoo.de</a> works fine. So i think it is either a problem with wget or a problem with tcp ...</p><p>Another test showed that if i am connecting a computer to the box which uses the box as gateway calling the page in the browser of the computer will show no problems at all... will do wireshark dumps of both ways and compare them maybe that helps.</p><p>Thanx</p>									</div>
