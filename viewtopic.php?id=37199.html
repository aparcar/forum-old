					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;m having problems getting extroot to work if the extroot device is specified by UUID (if I specify it by device path it works fine). Originally I have <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=37152">posted</a> that in the forum General Discussion forum, however now that it seems to be a bug in OpenWrt, I believe here is the right place to continue.</p><p>I&#039;ve been doing some debugging and while I&#039;m yet to confirm my theory after I&#039;m back from work, it all sums up. I believe that the extroot by UUID support was broken by <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/26245">changeset #26245</a>.</p><p>At the time when JFFS2 overlay is mounted on /tmp/overlay and /tmp/overlay/etc/config/fstab is scanned for the target extroot partition, the blkid command is used to determine which partition corresponds to the UUID specified by the user. The problem is, blkid is no longer included in the boot root filesystem so the attempt to read UUIDs of detected partition fails. And I was unable to find anything that would add /tmp/openwrt/sbin to the PATH variable so that blkid from JFFS2 can be used.</p><p>Is this all true or am I missing something? I&#039;m not the only one with this problem (and none of the other people has ever got it solved) so I think I might be correct.</p><p>Today I&#039;m going to confirm that the blkid command cannot be found and if yes, I will try setting PATH/LD_LIBRARY_PATH to see if blkid from the JFFS2 partition can be used instead.</p><p>In the meantime any input is most welcome. Thank you.</p>									</div>
