					<p>Hi all,</p><br /><p>I&#039;m doing some tests on a ixp4xx Pronghorn board running Kamikaze 8.09.</p><p>I would like to keep scanning AP (with iwlist athX scan) every two seconds or so.&nbsp; </p><p>I would like to use the same mini-pci card (AR5414)&nbsp; to do the continuous scanning but also to connect to some other wireless devices.</p><p>I&#039;ve noticed that&nbsp; when the mini-pci card is scanning for AP, it is not able to stay connected with the other wireless devices (e.g. ping doesn&#039;t not respond<br />when it is scanning, works ok when no scanning is performed).</p><p>Do you know what could be the problem here?</p><p>I can do this fine on various x86 pcs using the same mini-pci card, maybe this is related to the &quot;custom&quot; version of Madwifi being used?</p><p>I&#039;m also trying to compile trunk using the upstream version of Madiwifi instead of the custom one but I&#039;m getting the following error:</p><p>make[5]: Entering directory `/home/openwrt/PROVE/trunk/build_dir/linux-ixp4xx_generic/linux-2.6.28.5&#039;<br />&nbsp; CC [M]&nbsp; /home/openwrt/PROVE/trunk/build_dir/linux-ixp4xx_generic/madwifi-0.9.4/net80211/ieee80211_power.o<br />/home/openwrt/PROVE/trunk/build_dir/linux-ixp4xx_generic/madwifi-0.9.4/net80211/ieee80211_power.c: In function &#039;ieee80211_pwrsave&#039;:<br />/home/openwrt/PROVE/trunk/build_dir/linux-ixp4xx_generic/madwifi-0.9.4/net80211/ieee80211_power.c:240: error: implicit declaration of function &#039;__skb_append&#039;</p><p>Thank you so much,</p><br /><p>Francesco</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Did you find the solution to use the upstream madwifi-trunk ? Openwrt is not providing any documentation in using the madwifi upstream other than custom version ? </p><p>Most of the developers are very much interested in using the latest madwifi upstream. But still OpenWrt doesn&#039;t provide any solution and no one is answering concerned <br />using latest madwifi.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sara</strong> on 18 May 2009, 12:32)</p>
