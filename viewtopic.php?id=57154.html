					<p>I&#039;ve been wondering a little about whether to run trunk or Barrier Breaker on my Archer C5 - is there any functionality/packages that I will miss out on by switching to BB? I&#039;m not at all concerned about 5GHz, since I don&#039;t have any clients that support it, I just need IPv6, iptables, QoS and I&#039;m thinking about setting up some sort of VPN.</p><p>And speaking of VPNs, should I use OpenVPN or IPsec/Strongswan? What are the pros/cons of each?</p><p>Any advice and pointers to relevant material would be most appreciated.</p><p>Also, thanks to everyone who is working on OpenWRT, it is *really* nice to have such complete control and a familiar Linux interface on my router! Is there a way for us normal mortals that can&#039;t code to contribute? I can&#039;t find a link on how to donate, but I might not have looked hard enough - there really should be one on the front page <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Barrier Breaker should handle all that just fine. Better AC support is probably the biggest thing that is added in trunk for that device.</p>									</div>
