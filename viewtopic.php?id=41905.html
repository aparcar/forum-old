					<p>Here&#039;s a diagram of my network:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://s7.postimage.org/8l481qpgb/homenet2.png" alt="http://s7.postimage.org/8l481qpgb/homenet2.png" /></span></p><p>I&#039;ve set up a guest WLAN on Router 1, and it works fine. It&#039;s not that hard to set up guest access on a router that has direct WAN connectivity. So far so good.</p><p>Now I&#039;d like to have guest WLANs on the other 2 routers too, without losing their private WLAN connectivity, which is their main point. However, both Router 2 and Router 3 have the WAN port disconnected (they&#039;re basically running the private WLAN in AP mode, bridged to the main LAN).</p><p>Some relevant info: All my routers have multi-SSID radios and run OpenWRT, but I doubt my switches support port-based VLANs. Can I use tagged VLANs with dumb switches? I&#039;ve never used VLANs before, so I guess I&#039;ll have to figure out how to configure them before I can complain about the hardware not being supportive. That is, <em>if</em> VLANS are really necessary.&nbsp; Maybe I should encapsulate/tunnel guest traffic over the main LAN instead? Is there any package I can install to solve my problem? How? I&#039;m clueless.</p><p>To summarize: Do you have any alternative way to setup a guest network on an AP or any other advice to offer? </p><p>Thanks for reading through <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, </p><p>if you want it secure you should use VLANs. <br />1. your dump switches don&#039;t need to understand and process the VLAN-tags, it would be enough if they don&#039;t remove them. I guess a &quot;dump hub&quot; would work, but I&#039;m not sure about a &quot;dump switch&quot;. <br />But if this works you can setup the guest-AP and brigde it the other VLAN.<br />If the dump switches don&#039;t forward VLAN-tags there might be alternatives: </p><p>2. If Router2 and Router3 are near switch1 and switch2 you could switch places. e.g. connect LAN-port of the router1 to LAN-port of Router2 and switch1 to another LAN-port of Router2 (assuming Router2 and 3 have build-in switches which support VLANs) -&gt; setup VLAN for guest-APs</p><p>if this isn&#039;t an option<br />3. you have to route the traffic of the guest-APs through your private LAN, this won&#039;t be as secure as with VLANs but you could get it quite secure. <br />e.g. on Router2: <br />Don&#039;t brigde the guest-wifi to LAN, setup another subnet and firewall zone for it, and setup firewall rules that blocks&nbsp; traffic from the guest-wifi-zone to your your LAN-subnet (maybe you have allow traffic to the LAN-IP of router1). So guests won&#039;t be able to reach any client on your private LAN. <br />You can use NAT between guest-wifi and LAN, or you are routing between them (in this case you need to add a static route on router1 for the guest-subnets).</p><p>(But I would only go for option 3 if VLANs are no option)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 26 Jan 2013, 22:48)</p>

Can you suggest how I should set up the switch/vlan page on the 3 routers? I have made a few tests and it didn&#039;t work. I thought it&#039;s the switches&#039; fault, but maybe it was my configuration error instead.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>2.

However, I never managed to route 2 subnets through the private LAN (say, 192.168.1.x for the private LAN, 192.168.2.x for the guest LAN)</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>e.g. on Router2: <br />Don&#039;t brigde the guest-wifi to LAN, setup another subnet and firewall zone for it, and setup firewall rules that blocks&nbsp; traffic from the guest-wifi-zone to your your LAN-subnet (maybe you have allow traffic to the LAN-IP of router1).

I tried several times. I followed several how-tos, and they were all similar, with the firewall opening the guest subnet only to the WAN, but I don&#039;t have WAN on these APs, so how do I tell e.g. the firewall on router2 to forward packets from the guest WLAN to Router1 for WAN access?</p><p>Sorry if I&#039;m being thick, I&#039;ve been trying over a week without success...</p>									</div>
