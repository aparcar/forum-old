					<p>Dear Community, <br />sorry for my english, please continue reading:</p><p>i got myself an TP-Link Archer C7 v2.0 which is working nicely.<br />Now i bought a 2nd one, expecting it to be v2.0 as well. <br />As things went by, i ended up with v1.1.</p><p>Due to several circumstances i am not willing to send it back or whatever.<br />So i opened the case to look whats inside - found the expected hardware as mentioned here:<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr7500">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr7500</a><br />Archer C7 v1.1&nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; &nbsp; 2013-??-??&nbsp; &nbsp; BB (2.4GHz only)&nbsp; &nbsp; Technical Data&nbsp; &nbsp; QCA9880-AR1A (v1)</p><p>i am holding this ...mpcie card in my hands right now and i would be pleased, if i just could threw it away and replace it,</p><p>with something like this:<br />INTEL Dual Band Wireless-AC 7265 2x2 AC + BT PCI Express Half Mini Card</p><p>i know i would loose my 3x3 config by one that supports only 2x2, <br />but is it even possible to do so and get the Intel card running on my Archer C7 v1.1?<br />I would be very happy about any news whatsoever.<br />Best Regards,<br />Matho</p>									</div>
