					<p>I have a device (VOIP gateway) connected to my router by one of the ethernet interfaces. I&#039;d like to control whether the ethernet connection to that device is up or down based on whether my cell phone is present on the lan as well. Something like this</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ping cell phone ip
   if cell phone responds
       bring lan port 1 up
   if cell phone doesn&#039;t respond
       bring lan port 1 down
wait 60 seconds</code></pre></div><p>Anyone have an example of something similar I can start from?</p>									</div>
