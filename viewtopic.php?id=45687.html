					<p>Hello,</p><p>I was trying to connect a Mustek Powermust 650 UPS to my OpenWRT USB enabled router (TP-Link TL-WR1043N/ND v1), but it seems the nut package is not enough, and configuration is a real pain.</p><p>So, now I just want to be able to connect to it via a serial terminal (serial-usb emulation) from the router, like microcom. <br />I expect that, if my router is able to &quot;talk&quot; to the UPS even without the driver, I&#039;ll be able to create a script that can pool the UPS status. For instance, according to some sites around, it should be enough to issue the &quot;Q1&quot; command to obtain an answer from the UPS.</p><p>This UPS USB interface uses a USB-to-serial chip from Cypress in order to provide communication to it.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Bus 001 Device 003: ID 0665:5161 Cypress Semiconductor USB to Serial</code></pre></div><p>In order to make it working, I installed what I believe to be the necessary packages for it:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># opkg list-installed | grep usb
kmod-ledtrig-usbdev - 3.3.8-1
kmod-usb-core - 3.3.8-1
kmod-usb-ohci - 3.3.8-1
kmod-usb-serial - 3.3.8-1
kmod-usb-serial-cypress-m8 - 3.3.8-1
kmod-usb-storage - 3.3.8-1
kmod-usb2 - 3.3.8-1
libusb-1.0 - 1.0.9-1
usbutils - 005-1</code></pre></div><p>(I also have a webcam and a USB flash drive connected to the router, that&#039;s why I have additional packages)</p><p>Anyway, I guess this should be enough to have /dev/ttyUSB* devices, but unfortunately these aren&#039;t created.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># ls /dev/tty*
/dev/tty     /dev/ttyS1   /dev/ttyS11  /dev/ttyS13  /dev/ttyS15  /dev/ttyS3   /dev/ttyS5   /dev/ttyS7   /dev/ttyS9
/dev/ttyS0   /dev/ttyS10  /dev/ttyS12  /dev/ttyS14  /dev/ttyS2   /dev/ttyS4   /dev/ttyS6   /dev/ttyS8</code></pre></div><p>The dmesg shows what I believe to be normal behaviour:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># dmesg | grep -i usb
