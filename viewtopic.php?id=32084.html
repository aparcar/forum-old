					<p>I&#039;d like to use a second instance of uhttpd to run a simple script. How are HTTP GET and POST variables made available within such a shell script?</p><p>If I remember correctly, it used to be the name of the HTTP form element prefixed by &quot;FORM_&quot; under [s]Kamikaze&#039;s[/s] White Russian&#039;s busybox http server. But this doesn&#039;t seem the case with uhttpd anymore. Thanks for your help!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>penkert</strong> on 25 Sep 2011, 14:21)</p>

					<p>By use of the set command I found the query string of a GET request in a constant called QUERY_STRING. However, this is the complete query string, i.e. it&#039;s not dissected into its individual name and value pairs which makes it hard to deal with. Furthermore, so far I&#039;ve been unsuccessful in finding out if/how POST variables are being passed to a shell script.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thats neither OpenWrt nor uhttpd specific, search the internet for the basics of CGI scripting. It is a bad idea to do such low level data processing in shell scripts as it is very hard to do securely.<br />Best is to use a framework like &quot;haserl&quot; which does the heavy lifting for you, but again this is in no way OpenWrt specific.</p>									</div>

					<p>I thought it was uhttpd specific and documentation on that seems to be very slim. That&#039;s why I posted my question here...</p><p>Thanks for pointing me in the right direction, jow! I&#039;ll go check out haserl.</p>									</div>
