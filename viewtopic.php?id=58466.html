					<p>Hi, I have been using the branch &quot;barrierbreaker&quot; for some time. Loaded it onto my RTN-16 (brcm47xx) and have also done a custom compile using &quot;menuconfig&quot;. </p><p>I am wondering what I would have to gain (or lose) if I configured and compiled the &quot;trunk&quot; and loaded it instead. I have looked for comparisons of the capabilities but have found none.</p><p>Thank You<br />Tom</p>									</div>

					<p>This is what I can tell you.<br />e.g. 2 Tp-Link models 740 &amp; 841 you flash Snapshots, (Trunk) you will have more space for packages, cause Snapshots do not include LuCi.<br />BB is a stable Binary<br />Trunk is,&nbsp; Development snapshots are automatic unattended daily builds of the current OpenWrt development trunk. These images are generally not tested, use them at your own risk.<br />C/P from @draws post<br />Official builds of stable releases of OpenWrt have all had luci pre-installed for quite sometime. This is probably an oversight for rc2 or it was intentional as it is with trunk. Trunk is always luci free so that it can be tested without a luci bug throwing things off.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello danymarc,</p><p>I think that I understood most of what you said. Let me explain in my own words and please tell me if I understand correct.</p><p>The Trunk is where development is done. If anything new is developed that is the place where things are added. Binaries derived from compiling the trunk may not necessarily be stable because there is not much testing done. Trunk is always Luci free.</p><p>A branch, like BarrierBreaker, is derived from the trunk but is tested much more and is usually pretty stable. Stable releases will have Luci installed. </p><p>Corrections to the above?</p><p>One thing that I did not understand was &quot;C/P from @draws post&quot;.&nbsp; Sorry but I do not know what that means.</p><p>Thank You<br />Tom</p>									</div>
