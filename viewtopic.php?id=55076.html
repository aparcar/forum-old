					<p>I have TP-Link mr3020 wifi router and I have installed Huntsman 2014-01-25red in it. I have a Airtel 4g Lte usb dongle which is configured with it. Wan connectivity is available only when I connect the dongle after the router is completely powered on. If the router is power cycled having the dongle connected, the WAN connectivity is not there. Then I have to remove the dongle and insert it again to get the wan connectivity. </p><p>I tried to set the modem connection monitoring to toggle the modem and restart wan after timeout. but that does not work.</p><p>is there a solution for this ? or should I unplug and replug the usb dongle everytime i there is a power failure?</p><p>Any help is appreciated ! Thanks in advance <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>And also I want to mention that when WAN connectivity is available, the eth1 shows up in the ifconfig output. but, when wan connectivity is not there there is no eth1 in ifconfig output. try to bring up the eth1 throws error. then i unplug and re plug the usg dongle, eth1 shows up and wan connectivity is there.</p>									</div>
