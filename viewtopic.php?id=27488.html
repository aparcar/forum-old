					<p>Hi, </p><p>you have to give more details about your setup, and about what you want to achieve? <br />But I can tell you that you do not need any kind of mesh-routing! You should use some kind of wireless client mode or WDS. </p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode</a></p><p>Which one depends on your hardware, and on your needs. </p><p>If you only want to get access to the internet in your neighbors house the easiest and hardware-independend setup would be Routed Client (Using MASQUERADE) if you want access to resources in the neighbors-lan you should setup Routed Client (Using Routing). If both openwrt-devices use the same wifi-chipset you can think about WDS, and you can bridge your LAN and your neighbors LANs.</p>									</div>
