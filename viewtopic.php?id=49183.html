					<p>Hi,<br />I am working on a pair of&nbsp; gateworks GW2380 with latest build from gateworks (openwrt revision r36311) . I am using wds to establish a point to to point wireless network between GW2380 equipped with mini-pcie wireless N radios (atheros based). Since we are trying for long range low bandwidth link (5km+) we want to always operate the modems at MCS0 instead of using the auto switching algorithm. On station I am able to set the MCS index to 0 using </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iw dev wlan0 set bitrates mcs-2.4 0</code></pre></div><p> but on the acess point the same command is not working. Also is there a way to make this change permanent that is on each power up modem works only on MCS0.&nbsp; The basic rates command are not working. Even if i set the basic rate to 7200 kb/s using </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> uci add_list wireless.radio0.basic_rate=7200 </code></pre></div><p> it switches to other rates.</p><p>Best regards,<br />Mohit Mangal</p>									</div>

					<p>It can be done through rate control debugfs (via minstrel_ht), but I would strongly advise against it. Using a fixed rate rarely makes things better (especially since it typically limits retries as well).<br />Just use the default settings (and preferably update to latest trunk for the fixes).</p>									</div>

					<p>We are using this configuration for an application wherein one modem is mobile (small aircraft), and based on antenna orientation changes, the link strength sees sudden changes once in a while. What happens in these cases is that link would be operating at close to 10-15 Mbps ; SNR would be close to 15-20, and would suddenly fall for a few seconds due to orientation change of mobile antenna. In such a scenario, the link fades out, and takes a very long time to resume, even though the SNR improves within a couple of seconds. Our throughput requirement is barely 1-2 Mbps. We wanted to force the radio to work at highest sensitivity and lowest datarates, so that probability of link loss at such low SNRs can be handled better/gracefully.</p>									</div>

					<p>In that case, I would recommend disabling 802.11n completely, but keeping rate control enabled. <br />minstrel_ht and minstrel are very fast at adapting to rapidly changing links (and conservative enough in the retry chain to be very reliable), however aggregation is bad at dealing with bursts of complete packet loss.</p>									</div>
