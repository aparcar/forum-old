					<p>I have a net4521 that boots fine using the image from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/7.09/x86-2.6/openwrt-x86-2.6-jffs2-128k.image">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/7 â€¦ 128k.image</a> but refuses to boot using the latest kamikaze trunk. I believe it is a kernel issue, because I can take a bzImage generated from trunk using the config.gz from the downloaded image and the results are the same.</p><p>When I boot the trunk generated kernel, the get the standard soekris boot screen, the grub menu, then grub spits out the first little bit of information about the kernel boot parameters, then the screen is cleared and nothing else is printed. I have no idea where to start diagnosing this problem. Elsewhere on the web I can see that individuals are able to boot a 2.6.25 kernel with no problem, but I am simply unable to. Any help would be appreciated.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jeff</p>									</div>

					<p>Same problem here. <br />Boot fails as described using either of the grub boot options.&nbsp; <br />Same problem occurs using either the soekris 4821 profile or the X86-generic profile. <br />BTW, both profiles work with 7.09. Hope someone here has succeeded with this old board.<br />Red</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s something to do with openwrt patches to the kernel. I changed LINUX_VERSION in trunk/target/linux/x86/Makefile to 2.6.25 and recompiled and it boots fine. I haven&#039;t had time to check which patch caused the unwanted behaviour.</p><p>Jeff</p>									</div>

					<p>This is a follow up to our earlier thread.<br />The x86 boot problem has been fixed on the development trunk.<br />in the developers mailing list, Ulf Kype posted the following on 22-Nov-2008:</p><p>&gt;&gt; so the boot issue with kernel &gt; 2.6.25.6 on soekris boards as shown in<br />&gt;&gt; this ticket <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/4172">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/4172</a> is fixed, just tested<br />&gt;&gt; trunk 13333 on soekris net4521.<br />&gt;&gt; thanks to florian,<br />&gt;&gt; regards ulf</p><p>Inside ticket/4172 we learn that this problem appeared after the move away from kernel 2.6.25.4.<br />The issue was resolved by upgrading the kernel to 2.6.27.6 on the trunk.</p><p>I can confirm that i did a trunk build on 14-Dec-2008 (rev 13625) with a successful boot on a soekris 4511 and 4521.<br />I assume it will now also work with the alix boards</p><p>Regards,<br />Red</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Red</strong> on 15 Dec 2008, 14:03)</p>
