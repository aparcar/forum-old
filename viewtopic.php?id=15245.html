					<p>Yesterday on the irc channel I asked how the Alix board would perform on routing tasks... as I&#039;d like to change my Asus/Linksys metal. And a discussion started with Charles and Harlan; ex: some boards have crypto engines, others not, so wpa in everyday life can change things. After a short search in wiki and forum we saw that there have been a few benchmarking attempts but nothing about routing capabilities of these little boxes. Moreover since the last attempt developers introduced many new platforms - ie: no more broadcom 200mhz devices only.<br />So we are suggesting to make a new benchmarking attempt (eg: Kamikaze 7.09, no qos-scripts and additional packages, default config, only testing tools included in ufficial OpenWrt distribution). Charles draw this:</p><p><a href="http://www.widesol.com/wrtbenchmark/">http://www.widesol.com/wrtbenchmark/</a></p><p>I also suggested to add some &quot;application tests&quot;; kind of &quot;use cases&quot;; ex: samba, http, scp troughputs; but someone else suggested it would be too complex / time consuming, for people to test. I think that instead could be a good task for newcomers... many approach to openwrt &quot;to give it a try&quot;... and the benchmarking howto could give them a pretty good overview on installing stuff... while contributing with more benchmarking results...</p><p>Suggestions? Idea? If any, leave them here; I&#039;ll write a new wiki page then; a small howto setup a common testbed and make the tests and the table with the results.</p><p>Links:<br />- Previous benchmarking discussion: <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=5526">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=5526</a><br />- Some existing benchmarks: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Benchmarks/OpenSSL">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Benchmarks/OpenSSL</a><br />- nbd opinion on this new attempt: &quot;routing performance measurements under ideal conditions might indeed be useful; but without qos&quot;.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Wallace,</p><p>Did you ever find any benchmark results for the Alix boards? I&#039;m looking for precisely the same thing at the moment.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Sam</p>									</div>

					<p>@Wallace</p><p>I&#039;m interested in routing/bridging performance (LAN/LAN, WLAN/WLAN, WLAN/LAN) of different platforms (Alix, Avila Gateworks, Routerboard RB133, RB433, plain old Broadcom hardware). IMHO your setup looks fine; each test should mention the kernel version, WLAN hardware (in case of miniPCI slots).</p><p>We should be careful with hardware using VLAN tags towards the switch (for LAN and WAN) as the bandwidth of the MAC could be the limiting<br />factor for LAN/LAN performance. System (irq) load should be recorded as well, no idea how.</p><p>Some Freifunk guys tested a couple of devices using <strong>netpipe-tcp</strong> some time ago:<br /><a href="http://www.morgendorffer-consulting.de/doku.php?id=router_performance_messwerte">http://www.morgendorffer-consulting.de/ â€¦ _messwerte</a> (German only).</p><p>I&#039;ll work on this on an Alix 2c2 after I&#039;ve got Kamikaze running on it (incl. a Ralink WLAN USB NIC).</p>									</div>
