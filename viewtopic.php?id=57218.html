					<p>I had an issue today with the firewall Traffic Rules on Barrier Breaker and just like to post my work-around, if it happens to someone else:</p><p>My openwrt-router has a static config on LAN and WAN and I was able to edit the Traffic Rules with the LuCI GUI. Then I changed the WAN-IP and afterwards couldn&#039;t edit the Traffic Rules any more. A click on edit results in a kind of timeout-situation, which ends with the following message in the Browser:</p><p>&quot;Bad Gateway The process did not produce any response&quot;</p><p>My work-around ist to stop the WAN Interface, because then the Traffic Rules can be edited again. After all changes I reconnect the interface again.</p><p>bye</p>									</div>
