					<p>If your modem is not in bridged mode, then you have two options:</p><p>* Configure your WAN as a DHCP client, and your LAN interface as a DHCP server, or a different 192.168.x network (this is the default configuration for OpenWrt, if I recall correctly). Your router will act as a router, an NAT all devices connected to it.</p><p>* Bridge your WAN and LAN interfaces together, give it a fixed IP address, and disable the DHCP server (this is the dumb-AP mode, see <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap).">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap).</a></p>									</div>

I would not mess with the configuration files now, and try to do everything from Luci fist:</p><p>* Configure the LAN interface with a fixed 192.168.1.1 address, and add a DHCP server.<br />* Configure the Wifi as an access point, give it a name and a password, and bridge it to the LAN interface.<br />* Configure the WAN interface as a DHCP client and default gateway.<br />* Enable traffic from the LAN to the WAN, and activate masquerading.</p>									</div>

					<p>There are a couple of options here.&nbsp; </p><p>The first is basically what eduperez said.&nbsp; Starting from a default configuration where the ethernet port is in lan, connect your PC to the ethernet port and log in at 192.168.1.1.<br />Then change the lan address something other than that of your main router, though in the same subnet.&nbsp; For example if superhub 192.168.1.1, make the openwrt 192.168.1.2.&nbsp; Also you need to set the gateway and DNS to the IP of your superhub.&nbsp; Check the box that turns off DHCP.&nbsp; Apply these changes all at once.</p><p>At this point you can connect your PC to the superhub like a regular user (wifi or wired) and connect the one ethernet port to another LAN port on the superhub.&nbsp; Then browse to 192.168.1.2.&nbsp; You should see that the time of day has been set via the internet.&nbsp; You can then go to the software page and install packages.</p><p>The other option is to use the router as a router.&nbsp; First set up wifi and connect your PC via wifi.&nbsp; Then move the ethernet port to the wan network and leave that network at its default as a DHCP client.&nbsp; If your superhub is using 192.168.1.X, you need to change the LAN address in openwrt to something else like 192.168.2.1.&nbsp; After doing that, you will lose contact with the router until you disconect your PC and reconnect.&nbsp; Plug in the ethernet cable to the superhub and continue to access the lan side via wifi.&nbsp; Your PC and the router itself should now have internet.</p><p>The first method is probably more what you want for the eventual use of the router as a standalone device not connected to the internet.</p>									</div>
