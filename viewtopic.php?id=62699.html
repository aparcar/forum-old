					<p>First of all, I see that there is another thread about the WRT1900AC, but it&#039;s 400 pages long, and I have not found much information about the ACS in there.</p><p>I currently have an Netgear WNDR3700v2 that I have been using with OpenWRT for many years, it has been very stable and works perfectly.</p><p>I now need a faster router and I&#039;ve had an eye on the WRT1900AC since it was announced, but it was unsupported for a long time.</p><p>Is there any difference in OpenWRT support between the WRT1900AC v1/v2 and the WRT1900ACS?</p><p>Does everything work, if not, what are the problems it currently have with OpenWRT?</p><p>Where can I find a download for the ACS? Is it really the same as the v2?</p>									</div>

					<p>There&#039;s not a whole lot of difference between the 3 routers, and yes 2/ACS are identical in every way except the name.</p><p>OpenWrt is stable on all 3 versions, and performance is good. There are various issues, depending on who you talk to, but they are being tracked, and improved all the time with trunk releases.</p><p>Look at the wiki, and there are several types to download and try &gt;&nbsp; <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1900ac">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1900ac</a></p><p>I recommend doing a lot of reading before flashing, and I also recommend you have linux experience.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davidc502</strong> on 13 Feb 2016, 01:16)</p>
