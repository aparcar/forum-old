					<p>I have a WRT54G v2 with openwrt on it (it is most likely backfire). I had attempted to set it up as a wireless repeater and now I cannot connect to it at all. TFTP, telnet, ssh, failsafe mode, and virtually all reset button combos known to man do not work. What the router does do is this:<br />1. Attach power, power light starts blinking, switch ports all light up briefly, then the one I have connected lights up.<br />2. A few seconds later the DMZ light turns on.<br />3. A few seconds later I receive around 8 pings back, if I start pinging right when I power the router on the first ping is around the 47th try.<br />4. The Wlan light turns on, 2 more pings come in, then stop. (DESTINATION HOST UNREACHABLE error)<br />5. Around 10 seconds later the DMZ light turns off, and the power light goes steady. The pings flat out stop responding now, no DESTINATION HOST UNREACHABLE error.<br />6. If I remove the static IP from the connected computer it will receive a DHCP IP!</p><p>I have cleared the arp tables and run an nmap scan against it. nmap insists the router is up, despite the fact that regular pings fail. It also reports that all ports are filtered. Trying to connect via tftp, ssh, or telnet at any point always fails. I have tried TFTP with openwrt, dd-wrt, and the linksys image, all fail. Rapidly pressing the reset button during boot fails to alter the above process at all, same for holding it. No wireless network appears, despite the fact that the wlan light is on.</p><p>I am at a loss here, and have no idea what to do. I would really like not to have to solder a serial port on, as I have to order the parts and m not good at soldering, but if I have to I will. Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>									</div>

					<p>See wiki, follow generic failsafe instructions. Try all ethernet ports, failsafe only listens on one of them.<br />And yes, it does indeed work, timing is critical.</p>									</div>

					<p>So I just tried failsafe mode many times, with the computer connected to different ports and still nothing. What should the lights be doing when it enters failsafe mode? I have a wndr3700 that when it enters failsafe mode the power lights flashes rapidly.<br />Also, at what point in the boot process does the router check if it should enter failsafe mode? From my understanding when the DMZ light comes on the openwrt code has take over, so it should be checking as soon as the kernel boots, correct?</p>									</div>
