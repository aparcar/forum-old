					<p>I have a new Asus WL500W with a fresh install of openwrt 8.09 brcm47xx.&nbsp; Everything works great except wifi.&nbsp; The home page mentions that the b43 drivers are not fully stable, but I was hoping to get it working with some help.&nbsp; When I run a wifi up command I receive the following output:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> Configuration file: /var/run/hostapd-wlan0.conf

					<p>WL-500W won&#039;t work with kmod-brcm-wl driver that is included with Kamikaze 8.09. It works fine with BRCM-2.4 and not BRCM47xx. you need to go to Packages and uninstall kmod-brcm-wl, Update Package list, and install kmod-brcm-wl-mimo, after reboot you should be able to setup and use W-Fi on WL-500W without any issues, there is no support for 802.11n but b &amp; g work fine.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fareedf</strong> on 25 Feb 2009, 05:19)</p>

					<p>brcm47xx is a 2.6 kernel build; the kmod-brcm-wl-mimo package is only in the 2.4 build (ie brcm-2.4 section of the downloads). you need to reflash and use the 2.4 tree exclusively for this device, OR buy an atheros miniPCI and swap out the wifi chip.</p><p>The wl driver in 2.6 does not support the Broadcom 4329 chip in your router at all - not in b,g, or n mode. There is a binary-only nub in the wl_mimo driver that lets the chip run, under a 2.4 kernel, in g mode (still no n mode though!) and Broadcom are, as usual, pathetic at supporting projects like ours - don&#039;t expect 2.6 support for these chips anytime soon.</p><p>I&#039;m typing this through a WL500-W set up this way right now.</p>									</div>

					<p>Is there any consensus as to whether or not wireless will work with the ASUS WL-500W?&nbsp; In the information about the 8.09 release, there is mention of the b43 driver for broadcom support with a version 2.6 kernel; however, I can&#039;t find any information about how to configure it.&nbsp; Any assistance would be much greatly appreciated.</p>									</div>
