					<p>Hi, I currently have a Linksys wrt350n v1 running dd-wrt mini build 14896.&nbsp; I want to install OpenWrt on it to see how I might like OpenWrt because I never used it before.&nbsp; </p><p>I noticed in the download repository there are only two sections with a bin file with my router model in it (named openwrt-wrt350n_v1-squashfs.bin), one in the backfire directory and one in the kamikaze directory.&nbsp; I also saw a directory called whiterussian but it had no bin file with my router model.</p><p>So a few questions:</p><p>1.Which is the one I would need, or is there another one I missed that would be preferred? </p><p>2. If I could use either one, what suggestions would you make in terms of possible benefits of one firmware over the other, or any features that it offers which is distinguishable from the other?</p><p>3. What procedure is there to upgrade, is it as simple as a bin upgrade from the Administration page of dd-wrt now?<br />Are there any follow up steps (ie: hard reset and such, enabling boot_wait, or steps to add commands to have a GUI available for OpenWrt)?</p><br /><p>I have a serial connection available and soldered in place with an outside easy connection hookup to the router, should I brick it, I can recover from most bricks, no jtag though so can not recover from a broken cfe (not yet anyway waiting for jtag by mail)</p><p>Thanks in advance for any advice and guidance.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sodapopdima</strong> on 3 Apr 2011, 22:14)</p>
