					<p>Hello folks,</p><p>I&#039;m currently running a home NAS using a 4-bay USB 3 enclosure and an old Dell Precision desktop.&nbsp; It works, but man, is it overkill for what I need! Can anyone offer a recommendation on an OpenWRT-capable router that supports USB 3?&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t have to be 802.11ac, just has to have a USB 3.0 interface so I can hook up my drives.</p><p>The other piece of the puzzle is that my drives are in a RAID 1 setup with mdadm, and are partitioned with LVM.&nbsp; How is OpenWRT&#039;s RAID/LVM support?</p><p>John</p>									</div>

					<p>Get a pogoplug or raspberry pi (or similar). They&#039;re both have much faster CPUs and more RAM than most OpenWrt routers. You&#039;ll have more flexibility too as you can run a full linux distro (e.g. Arch Linux ARM or Debian). </p><p>Even with a faster ARM CPU in the pogoplug/raspberry pi, I&#039;m not sure you&#039;ll really be able to take advantage of USB 3.0 speeds.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;d even recommend getting a NAS or a NAS enclosure if you want to re-use drives, for two reasons:</p><p>a) Even cheaper NAS hardware is far better optimized towards this purpose.<br />b) I would strongly suggest to keep storage hardware separated from infrastructure hardware. You really don&#039;t want a single point of failure for both your network and your storage.</p><p>Router hardware is really only suitable if you don&#039;t really mind about throughput. That&#039;s why I usually don&#039;t get the requests for USB3 ports in routers when the rest of the hardware can&#039;t keep up.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah... was wondering about the throughput issue.&nbsp; Figured I&#039;d take a hit, but hoped that with decent enough HW (1 GHz CPU, 512 MB RAM), performance wouldn&#039;t be too much of an issue.</p><p>Sounds like I&#039;d best keep doing what I&#039;m doing and just look for a more compact NAS solution.&nbsp; A laptop with an ExpressCard would probably do the trick, and I might be able to swing it with my HTPC.</p><p>This is _home_ storage, after all, so downtime really isn&#039;t a problem for me.&nbsp; Really critical stuff is backed up offsite as well.</p><p>Will pick up a cheap TP-Link and mess around with USB 2 storage -- might be suitable for smaller incremental backups, and I&#039;d still like the flexibility of CLI access on my own router.</p><p>Another option would be to built a router myself from a laptop and standalone switch.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jorymil</strong> on 23 Oct 2014, 00:04)</p>

					<p>If you must get a PogPlug, make sure it is at least a V4-A3-01 (with one SATA and two USB3 ports). If you peruse this <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=52809">discussion</a> thread, there was such a PogoPlug V4-A3-01 for under US $15 with a free S/H to US from an e-bay seller. Since you have three. BTW, the PogoPlug is ONLY clocked at 700 MHz (IIRC) with 128 MB RAM. If you can still get some Seagate GoFLEX NET (CPU clocked @1.2 GHz with 128 MB RAM), it is a better choice because it comes with two SATA ports + 1 USB2 port. There may be a power issue with the 2nd SATA port on the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/seagate/goflexnet">Seagate GoFLEX NET</a>.</p>									</div>
