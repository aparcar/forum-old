					<p>I&#039;m looking for a mini-PCI ADSL modem, mainly because I&#039;m tired of having to set up port-forwarding or DMZ, and adding a second modem-looking box to my OpenWrt setup.&nbsp; It would be great to nail QoS, NAT to the modem itself.&nbsp; However, there are no mini-PCI ADSL modems out there.&nbsp; Even the PCI modems available have binary &quot;blobs&quot; scattered throughout their open-source Linux drivers.</p><p>My questions:<br />Why are there no mini-PCI ADSL modems out there?</p><p>What would it take to make such a thing?</p>									</div>

					<p>Traverse Technologies makes two PCI ADSL2+ modems that don&#039;t have binary blobs in the Linux drivers.</p><p>There aren&#039;t any mini-PCI ADSL modems out there because there isn&#039;t a big enough market for them.<br />Find someone who will order thousands of cards and it might make the development worthwhile.</p>									</div>
