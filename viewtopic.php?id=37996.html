					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;m a OpenWrt newbie (and programming in general), but I have few questions:</p><p>I want my first computer (android device actualy) to send periodicaly udp&#039;s frames to 5 WRT54GL with openWrt. This works well with a java program</p><p>Then I want my 5 WRT54GL to receive the UDP frames, calculate their signal strenth, the get the data part of the udp frame and send a new udp frame with a new data :&quot;old-data + signal strenth&quot;.</p><p>Finaly a second computer will get these new frames and annalyse them to localise the firsyt computer in the wifi network. (it aloso works well with a java program)</p><br /><br /><p>So my problem is :<br />1) How can I create a udp listener in the WRT54GL to get the initial frames?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // I think I should put a C++ program in /home, with a C++ udp listener, is that right? I have never used C++ but I shouldn&#039;t be&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so hard</p><br /><p>2) How can I get the signal strenth from this frame?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;// I found the &quot;wl rssi $REMOTE_WIFI_MAC&quot;, but can I put this command in the middle od the C++ program? and can I foud a way to avoid the&nbsp; $REMOTE_WIFI_MAC since I dont want to create a database with all the wireless devices of the network.<br />2) How can I send a new frame?</p><br /><p>by advance, thank you</p>									</div>
