					<p>Hello.</p><p>I have the following situation here:</p><p>My ISP has a PPPoE WAN interface, and on that same WAN interface it has a big peering network, 10.0.0.0/8, spanning over multiple cities. My traffic to the big Internet is throttled to 3Mbit/s, and the traffic to the regional network is unlimited 100 Mbit/s, so I don&#039;t want any shaping/QoS on that traffic.</p><p>After playing a bit with iptables/mangle I realized that the actual shaping is done on the tc&#039;s side. But I don&#039;t know how to tell Nbd&#039;s QoS scripts to ignore some IP ranges then.</p><p>How do I should set up Nbd&#039;s QoS scripts for that to work?</p><p>PS. (and how the hell the ISP manages to get 100Mbit/s over PPPoE? That&#039;s a huge load on the backbone hardware, AFAIK. Wow!)</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t know how to do it with anyones QoS scripts, but in general I can tell you that if you QoS, you always QoS everything.</p><p>So what if you can use 100mbit in the local network? Just make a global QoS and allocate a class for the nearly 100mbit (measure actual throughput if possible or use a moderate value please). If you got all traffic accounted for in your QoS tree, you can make sure, that a local 100mbit connection on the same interface as the 3mbit internet one, the local one does not choke the (much more important) internet bandwidth.</p><p>For example with HTB, you could have a 100mbit root class, a 3mbit internet child to that class, and a 97mbit local traffic class. That&#039;s the only way to actually guarantee the 3mbit window to the internet. And that&#039;s the way I did things when I had a file server running on the router as well, as to make sure that file server traffic (which could easily occupy 100% of the 100mbit available in the LAN) does not choke internet traffic (which was only 1mbit at the time and became unuseable when dominated by local traffic).</p>									</div>

					<p>Oh...<br />I&#039;m a newbie in QoS&#039;s wrapper, and am too lazy to set up a tc/tcng with my own hands. Maybe someone will pop up with a suggestion regarding this technique?</p><p>Anyway, I&#039;m very glad to see the community responding that fast.<br />Will be trying to set up it in the meanwhile... but other solutions are always welcome...</p>									</div>
