					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;ve got barrier breaker running, r38578. I&#039;m configured for IPv6, and Comcast is delegating me a prefix. Recently, I think they updated the CMTS that serves my house. I&#039;m now able to successfully get a /60 prefix. As a result, I am also able to allocate multiple /64s in my network. I&#039;ve been running a guest network, per the wiki instructions. I allocated a /64 prefix to this network. I can see both in the LUCI configuration and on endpoints I connect to the guest network that the prefix is recognized. The endpoint clients see the DNS, router, and a route to the router. However, they do not seem to be able to talk out to the internet. I reviewed the firewall rules for DNS and such coming out of the guest tutorial, and it looks to me like they should all apply to IPv6 as well.</p><p>In sum: I now have a /60, and have allocated /64s to my two local networks. The first v6 /64 subnet allocated (lowest number) to my primary lan is working just fine on both IPv4 and IPv6. The additional guest network can only do IPv4. Is there some addition configuration or trick to get IPv6 routing out from any but the first locally allocated /64 IPv6 subnet?</p><p>These are what I used to set up my guest network -- IPv4 is working fine:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan-webinterface">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/gue â€¦ binterface</a></p><p>Thanks,</p><p>B</p>									</div>

					<p>You need to duplicate the &quot;Allow-ICMPv6-Input&quot; and &quot;Allow-ICMPv6-Forward&quot; rules with the source zone set to &quot;guest&quot;.<br />Right now your firewall settings prevent (proper) ICMPv6 communication between your guest clients and the router, so IPv6 address resolution fails, leading to the symptoms you&#039;ve described.</p>									</div>

					<p>I was experiencing the same problem with my vlans. My ISP gives me a /56 ipv6 subnet to work with and although my primary lan had stellar ipv6 support, my vlans had no luck.</p><p>Jow&#039;s post helped me to fix it, although did not notice at first to change the source from wan to guest, and kept changing the dest network to no avail.</p><p>Many thanks Jow.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lazarost</strong> on 18 Feb 2014, 11:21)</p>

					<p>@jow <br />Seems that duplicating the Allow-ICMPv6-Input and Allow-ICMPv6-Forward rules do not work anymore in Chaos Calmer (currently on 43488).</p><p>Sometimes (but not always) the guest clients will get an ipv6 address and work normally but that will not appear in the luci interface. Seems like the client can&#039;t get the request in to the router cause of the firewall settings.</p><p>Only thing that fixes it is changing the option INPUT to ACCEPT on the guest zone in the firewall but that defeats the purpose.<br />Any insights ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks a lot CyrusFF, that fixes it completely.</p><p>Perhaps someone could update the wiki with these three rules, it should come handy for anyone else looking to have a v6 guest network.</p>									</div>
