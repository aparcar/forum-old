					<p>Hi, i have compiled the PIM(Protocol Independent Multicast) for the Backfire10.03.1 and it installed properly. Even it runs properly as i can see the multicast table and the advertisement to the other routers in the network. But the problem is I&#039;m not able to stream video from one network to the other, but able to do the same in the same subnet. I&#039;m not understanding where i may went wrong and how to solve the problem? I&#039;ve enables the ip forwarding as well as the mc forwarding also? Can anyone pls guide me to solve the problem? Or is there any other way I can show multicasting through Openwrt?<br />Thanks for any help.</p>									</div>
