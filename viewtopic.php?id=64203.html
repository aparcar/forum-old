					<p>Hi,</p><p>I use the Linksys WRT 1200AC router and Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 (r48532) version.</p><p>I have setup JamVM en MySQL for my java program and everything works except for the IPv6 communication. When testing the IPv6 in Java, I get this error and not the typical java exception:</p><p>&quot;Address family not supported by protocol&quot;</p><p>So JamVM is not causing the problem, I think, but rather the classpath or lower dependencies. I have looked into the classpath documentation and as far as I can see, it supports IPv6?</p><p>Can someone help me locate or fix the problem?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>The JamVM package was and maybe still is accompanied with Classpath GNU. Classpath GNU is mostly java 1.5 compliant.</p><p>As I could not find the solution at the time, I switched the OpenWrt C-library so that I was able to use a more standard ARM Java implementation. I think it was Java Embedded SE</p>									</div>
