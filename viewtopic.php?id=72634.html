					<p>We have an U-Blox LILY-W1 Module and a 4.4.14 Kernel with the Marvell closed source driver. The driver work well and the two devices mlan0 and uap0 are OK. But we cannot use the LUCI Webinterface to connect to an Access Point. We can scan for existing SSIDS but if we try to connect nothing happens. It seams that OpenWRT is not calling the wpa_supplicant to connect to the access-point. Does somebody have experience with devices like the Marvell Avastar 88W8801?</p>									</div>
