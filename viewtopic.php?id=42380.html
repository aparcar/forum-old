					<p>Yes you need to use a serial console (you can buy a cp2102 based usb converter on ebay) but you need to solder its pin as specified in the wiki to make it work.

					<p>OK..</p><p>&quot;Firstly - DO NOT upgrade to the 28.08.2013 (or newer) firmware on TP-Link website. It has modified u-boot, and applies a NEW UNKNOWN header - first byte is 0x03.
