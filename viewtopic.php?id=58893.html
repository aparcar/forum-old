					<p>Hello everyone!<br />This is my first time posting here, I have used OpenWRT for a while now, on the capable TL-WR703N and I am very happy with it.</p><p>I however recently acquired three ipTIME mini routers that are sold as WiFi extenders. The web interface is in Korean (bit of a schlep navigating that) although most of the HTML code is in english! There is javascript running on top which renders the Hangul.<br />Oh and did I mention they are $10 each?<br /><a href="http://iptime.com/iptime/?page_id=11&amp;pf=6&amp;page=&amp;pt=209&amp;pd=1">http://iptime.com/iptime/?page_id=11&am â€¦ 9&amp;pd=1</a><br />You can find them on Gmarket - Korea&#039;s Ebay. There is a version with a built in battery -&gt; but that is three times the price.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://contents.iptime.co.kr/~contents/home/mini/mini_01.jpg" alt="ipTIME Mini" /></span></p><p>What makes these little beasties special is the fact that they have three WiFi radios - quite nice for extending your WiFi. (Only one antennae I can see though?)<br />I managed to get it working as a repeater after extended trail and error + educated guesses + Google Translate. Technical Korean is not that easy.</p><p>I would however like to run OpenWrt on them.<br />I cracked one open and was pleasantly surprised to find that the serial port has some headers soldered on!<br />So I plugged it in to see what goes on inside.</p><p>As far as I can tell it is running MIPS Linux Standalone Program on a Ralink RT5350F, has 8Mbytes of memory, 64Mbits of DRAM and a 360MHZ CPU + two buttons, reset and WPS.</p><p>The bootup code is pasted here: <a href="http://pastebin.com/Hw5dY8PV">http://pastebin.com/Hw5dY8PV</a><br />I noticed it can do a tftp boot <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> - same way I rescued a WR703N.</p><p>The CPU is compatible since I&#039;ve seen it in other devices which can run OWrt.</p><p>So, is this possible, how do I go about building an image?<br />I&#039;m fairly proficient with coding, but I don&#039;t know Linux that well or Kernel/firmware coding.</p><p>I would appreciate being pointed in the right direction so I can start playing.</p><p>-<br />Chris</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>no1089</strong> on 7 Aug 2015, 04:53)</p>

Although it doesn&#039;t say anything about flash size, the firmware image reports as 831 kB size. So it may well be one of those unsupportable devices with 2 MB flash and 8 MB RAM.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 7 Aug 2015, 05:02)</p>

Well the primary reason for wanting to run OpenWrt is to get rid of the Korean interface.<br />This is what I found searching the ram chip&#039;s part number: (winbond w9864g6kh-6)<br />SDRAM SDR 64MX16 166MHZ 54TSOPII</p>									</div>
