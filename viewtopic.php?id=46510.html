					<p>Very new to OpenWRT and wireless config in general here, so hoping I&#039;m missing something obvious. I followed the recipe at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds</a> to get things set up.</p><p>I have a pair of Buffalo WZR-600DHPs I&#039;m trying to bridge using WDS. It works fine when I only have one of the two radios (radio0) enabled on the AP. However, when I try with both radio0 and radio1, any client attached to the station manages to get an IP assigned, but no traffic flows through the AP to the internet.</p><p>I&#039;ve checked that the SSIDs and encryption settings match for both radios, for both AP and Station. On the AP, the Mode is set to Access Point (WDS) for both radios. On the station, it&#039;s set to Client (WDS) for both.</p><p>Any suggestions on what I may be doing wrong and how to check?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Not intentionally. Both radios on the station were in client/WDS mode. Both radios on the other router were in AP/WDS mode. Not sure why that would cause a loop, if that&#039;s indeed what happened.</p>									</div>

					<p>You might get better performance, if you set only one radio for WDS and then connect to the other radio with the clients. That way the STA router does not waste its bandwidth for repeater functionality.</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_distribution_system#Technical">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_d â€¦ #Technical</a><br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>The maximum wireless effective throughput may be halved after the first retransmission (hop) being made. ... The throughput is halved, because AP B has to retransmit the information during the communication of the two sides. ... Dual band/radio APs may avoid this problem, by connecting to clients on one band/radio, and making a WDS network link with the other.</p></blockquote></div><p>I used that config with my WDS config. And there is no need for STP.</p>									</div>
