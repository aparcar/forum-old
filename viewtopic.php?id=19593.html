					<p>heya,</p><p>Is there any way, using OpenWRT as a base, to track bandwidh by IP/MAC in a network? Any packages that would do this?</p><p>Clients will be connecting via both wireless and wired.</p><p>I&#039;ve done a search, but I can&#039;t seem to find anything on it, without using a separate computer to actually do the monitoring. I do have access to a internet-accessible MySQL server, so if there&#039;s a package that uploads the data to that, that would also work.</p><p>Cheers,<br />Victor</p>									</div>
