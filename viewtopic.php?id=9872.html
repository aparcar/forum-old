					<p>The ToH list doesn&#039;t seem to include any newer routers that I have been looking at such as:</p><p>D-Link:<br />DGL-4300<br />DI-724GU<br />DIR-655</p><p>Linksys:<br />WRT330N<br />WRT350N</p><p>Netgear:<br />WNR854T</p><p>I&#039;d rather have a good router and know that I have the router I want, and push come to shove, put OpenWRT on it down the road if need be, than buy another cheap router just so I know OpenWRT will work on it and then be disappointed by the QoS performance.</p><p>Does anyone have an idea what the specs are on the above routers, or the likelihood of the above routers EVER having OpenWRT on them?</p>									</div>

					<p>WRT330N is Ubicom as well; I opened one up a while back.&nbsp; IIRC it was a newer Ubicom chip than in the DGL-4300/4100 (a 51xx-series or something), but I doubt that makes any difference.</p><p> -=Marcus</p>									</div>

					<p>I found this via a Google search.</p><p>First, can you provide more details about why the Ubicom chipset will not be supported.&nbsp; Is it because of the difficulty and design, because you don&#039;t like them, that there is some lockdown in the chip that makes it impossible to support, etc.</p><p>The WRT350N is a piece of crap.&nbsp; &nbsp;In fact, I&#039;ve been very disappointed at the lack of quality in Linksys lately -- they used to make routers that would last forever.&nbsp; &nbsp;Reviews everywhere seem to agree with me.</p><p>I opted to buy a DIR-655 D-Link.&nbsp; Too bad it&#039;s not supported by another firmware (yet) - though hopefully soon ;-)&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t know much about Ubicom (hence my question above).</p><p>Thanks!</p><br /><div class="quotebox"><cite>mbm wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>DIR-655 is a ubicom chipset and will not be supported.<br />WRT350N is currently a work in progress, already booting into openwrt.<br />(clip)</p></blockquote></div>									</div>
