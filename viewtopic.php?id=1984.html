					<p>As far as I can tell, the ncurses package seems to be misconfigured in the<br />whiterussian release and the current development snapshot.&nbsp; Some time back<br />there was a brief discussion of a problem with the default libraries.&nbsp; It seems to be that the current<br />snapshot is not configuring this package for the target build system.&nbsp; (i.e. the <br />ncurses makefile specifies the target as GNU_HOST).&nbsp; &nbsp;I am new to openwrt to my apologies in advance if this<br />is an error on my part.</p>									</div>
