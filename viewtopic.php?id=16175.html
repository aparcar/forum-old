					<p>I am experiencing some problems with my samba shares on wl-500GP. I used the standard smb.conf file that came with kamikaze 7.09, with minimal changes to the config to overcome first permission problems I ran upon. That is I changed guest account to root. </p><p>Everything works like its supposed to when share is accessed from Windows, but from Linux there are various problems. I am currently using Fedora 9, and when share is mounted by gnome (gvfs) I cant even see the files on share. I can create a file though, but the moment I refresh list it dissapears (although its sucessfuly created on the filesystem).<br />Ok, I thought that it could be some Gnome things so I went to smbclient. However, it displays uncomplete names of files, with last letter missing, although it works when I add the missing letter. (for example file named &quot;test&quot; would be diplayed as &quot;tes&quot; but &quot;rm test&quot; would work)<br />Mounting with mount.cifs (tried various options, setting uid, gid etc) diplays files correctly, I can delete files (cant delete dirs that are not empty, not even from windows), but I cant access files (read/write) on mounted dir, even as root. I get permission denied, even though permissions look perfectly fine to me <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I&#039;d really appreciate if someone could share his experiences with samba on kamikaze and share his smb.conf.<br />Perhaps someone had better luck with optware samba3 (though it looks rather heavy)? </p><p>smb.conf<br />----------- </p><p>[global]<br /> syslog = 0<br /> syslog only = yes<br /> workgroup = OpenWrt<br /> server string = OpenWrt Samba Server<br /> security = share<br /> encrypt passwords = yes<br /> guest account = root<br /> local master = yes<br /> name resolve order = lmhosts hosts bcast</p><p>[download]<br /> comment = download<br /> path = /opt/download<br /> browseable = yes<br /> writeable = yes<br /> public = yes</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>PinkBunny</strong> on 1 Jul 2008, 15:13)</p>

					<p>Hi,<br />if everything works on Windows but not on your Linux, I&#039;d say that there is something with your Fedora client. I actually have the same config file as you and I&#039;m mounting it with the following entry in /etc/fstab:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># Samba
//192.168.2.1/usb        /extra/         smbfs       uid=myuser,guest    0       0</code></pre></div><p>I&#039;m on Debian though</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Tex-Twil</strong> on 1 Jul 2008, 23:06)</p>

					<p>Yeah, not really sure with fedora. Your settings look fine to me save using root as the guest account. I simply fiddled with my passwd and smbpasswd files in the /etc and /etc/samba directories respectively to get my shares functioning. As this was for an NSLU2 with an old default partition/username setup from the original firmware, I needed to get it functional without wiping the drive(s) and starting over.</p>									</div>
