					<p>I am working with IPv6 from Comcast.&nbsp; The prefix delegation received via DHCPv6 changes very often.&nbsp; I am using radvd on Barrier Breaker due to stability issues with 6relayd. I recently noticed a situation where the prefix had changed and even though the lan IP had changed,&nbsp; radvd was advertising both old and new prefixes on the lan.&nbsp; Clients pickup both and generate IPs.&nbsp; Clients who preferred the old prefix (both were valid and preferred) could not communicate via IPv6 due to there being no route.&nbsp; Has anyone else seen this issue and is there a solution?</p><p>My radvd config is as follows:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface
        option interface        &#039;lan&#039;
        option AdvSendAdvert    1
        option AdvManagedFlag   0
        option AdvOtherConfigFlag 0
        list client             &#039;&#039;
        option ignore           0

config prefix
        option interface        &#039;lan&#039;
        # If not specified, a non-link-local prefix of the interface is used
        list prefix             &#039;::/64&#039;
        option AdvOnLink        1
        option AdvAutonomous    1
        option AdvRouterAddr    0
        option AdvValidLifetime 14400
        option AdvPreferredLifetime 10800
        option ignore           0

config route
        option interface        &#039;lan&#039;
        list prefix             &#039;&#039;
        option ignore           1

config rdnss
        option interface        &#039;lan&#039;
        # If not specified, the link-local address of the interface is used
        list addr               &#039;&#039;
        option ignore           1

config dnssl
        option interface        &#039;lan&#039;
        list suffix             &#039;&#039;
        option ignore           1</code></pre></div>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mbidewel</strong> on 24 Feb 2013, 01:59)</p>

					<p>I did some&nbsp; more research.&nbsp; It appears that radvd must be send SIGHUP if and when the prefix changes.&nbsp; Any ideas where to add this?</p>									</div>
