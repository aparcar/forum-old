					<p>Maybe I&#039;m missing something or my google-fu is on the fritz, but I can&#039;t seem to figure out how/where the files that end up in /etc/config get created.</p><p>I&#039;m doing a custom build process. Specifically I want to change the default network setup to a non-bridged config. <br />Currently I&#039;m setting the default lan settings in make menuconfig (UCI-PRECONFIG -&gt; uci-defaults). The contents of ~/base-files/etc/config/network don&#039;t seem to go over to the build-mipsel&nbsp; hierachy. I&#039;m assuming this is overridden by the make config (and maybe the makefile for the base-files dir?).</p><p>In any case, the contents of /etc/config/network on a unit ends up containing more than just the lan settings that are part of the uci-defaults (ie. VLAN, loopback, and WAN). So what I&#039;m wondering is how does this file get created?</p><p>As an aside, I had previously modified the build so that the /etc/config/wireless file had the wireless enabled by default and used a specific SSID. Now I can&#039;t remember how (it&#039;s been a couple months), but I suspect I had simply added the file to base-files which I&#039;m guessing disappeared when I ran a make clean (distclean?). Scratch that - I just found where I did that; I modified the ~/packages/broadcom-wl/files/lib/wifi/broadcom.sh file. Hmm, I should probably document that or find some more standard/obvious way of doing it than burying the modification out of the way in an otherwise standard package.</p><p>So I&#039;m guessing there is another script or three that fills in the config/network file, I just haven&#039;t found it yet. Which leaves me wondering if setting up the network config to come from base-files will end up being clobbered by whatever scripts are involved here.</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>									</div>

					<p>I seem to recall that some of the /etc/config-files are generated in a few different places. However, the easiest way to customize files in the final build is just to create a folder &quot;files&quot; in the parent openwrt folder. For instance, for my customized router build i have the following files and directories under the files-folder:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>vahonen@desktop ~/src/openwrt $ ls -R files
files:
etc

files/etc:
config  ethers  firewall.config  fstab  hosts  passwd

files/etc/config:
network  ntpclient  qos  timezone  updatedd  wireless</code></pre></div><p>I find this approach works great and is easy to maintain.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey!</p><p>So i would customize my network config of the image that I am building. I have at home ADSL, so i need put extra pppoe id and password line in the /etc/config/network. But i dont know how. Because the file is generated during making process. You said that I should put a files directory and an alternative network file, isn&#039;t it? And than the generating will have no effect?</p><p>Cheers, JÃ¡nos</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kukodajanos</strong> on 27 Feb 2011, 06:46)</p>

					<p>I am also trying to setup a default configuration for my build.&nbsp; Putting config files in &#039;files/etc/config&#039; works fine, however there are a couple issues with this approach.&nbsp; For example, the wireless config contains an unique MAC address for the radio... so this cannot be hard-coded in the config file (or it will only work on the 1 router with the matching MAC).&nbsp; Another approach is to create uci-defaults scripts (etc/uci-defaults) to only modify what is needed.&nbsp; Here&#039;s an example of my &#039;etc/uci-defaults/qos&#039; script:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

uci batch &lt;&lt;EOF
set qos.wan.upload=512
set qos.wan.download=2048
set qos.wan.enabled=0
commit qos
EOF

uci commit qos</code></pre></div><p>Notice that it only modifies the lines I want to change, instead of the entire config file.</p><p>I do have a problem with this though, as my wireless config is not being updated on the first boot.&nbsp; I suspect this is because the wireless config is generated via &#039;wifi detect &gt; /etc/config/wireless&quot;... and this doesn&#039;t occur until after the uci-defaults scripts are executed.</p><p>Does anyone have a suggestion about how to setup the default wireless configuration?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>LinkZ</strong> on 23 Mar 2011, 06:02)</p>
