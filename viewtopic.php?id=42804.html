					<p>Hi mate, <br />I probably could help you using fairuzaWRT firmware since I&#039;m aware of how to use WRT linksys router CLI.<br />Could you list me the different ways you tried to flash your router?<br />Moreover, I&#039;m actually looking for fairuzaWRT firmware to flash my WRT54GL router...do you have any idea where I can find this firmware ?</p>									</div>
