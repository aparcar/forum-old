					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a Dlink DIR-615 with OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment 12.09 Release installed.&nbsp; I would like to configure the unit to act as a pure Layer 2 Bridge between the WAN and LAN ports.&nbsp; I have an existing Internet Router/Gateway supplied by the ISP and do not want that to be replaced but would want to use the Dlink in a transparent bridge mode where I can apply iptables filter as well as bandwidth throttling.&nbsp; I do not need to have PPOE, Dailup, DHCP, NAT/Proxy or firewalling features on the Dlink.</p><p>My Question is</p><p>Internet -----&nbsp; ISP Router/Gateway/Firewall&nbsp; ----&nbsp; Dlink DIR-615 ------ LAN Switch</p><p>1) Can the Transparent bridge be done between the WAN and LAN Ports?<br />2) Wifi is not needed at the moment but would be good if it also can be bridged to the WAN port.</p><p>Any pointers on how to get this done would be highly appreciated.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you.</p><p>Regards,</p>									</div>
