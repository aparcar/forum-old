					<p>Hi David,</p><p>Thanks the response to my earlier question about 1900ACS rebooting at HD I/Os. I will work on that later per your suggestion. </p><p>I got another issue that might be related to the new build: `fsck.hfsplus` from `hfsfsck` does not work. When I use your previous build, `fsck.hfsplus` works. However, after I upgrade to the current build (I also upgraded to kernel 4.9), `fsck.hfsplus` always return &quot;Illegal instruction&quot; on any of my HFS+ volumes.</p>									</div>
