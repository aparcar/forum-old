					<p>So what is your actual setup? Do you need both routers to allow clients to connect wirelessly? Than WDS is good. </p><p>Be careful about Linksys routers, their modern versions don&#039;t support OpenWRT unless you go for a WRT54SLGS or a WRT54GL. Other companies have OpenWRT ready routers more reliably but I don&#039;t know the specifics (I just have a bunch of ones I got years ago or bought used). </p><p>I don&#039;t think you can divide the antennas like that. You may wish to just get two. Alternately you can use only one antenna.</p>									</div>

					<p>Currently one of the houses is covered with a Linksys router (OpenWRT).

					<p>Hi, </p><p>as far as i know most of the accesspoints only have one wifidevice and it switches between the two antennas to the one with the stronger signal, so the antennas aren´t active at the same time. So I guess its not a good idea to use one accesspoint with different antennas for both the local wifi and the link between the buildings, because it has to switch beween the two antennas all the time. I´m not sure if this setup would work at all, and if it works,&nbsp; I don´t think this would work very well. so you should think about getting a dedicated acesspoint for the link at every location, or maybe an accesspoint with two wifidevices, but i think they are quite expensive.</p>									</div>

					<p>I intend to use this link for file transfers as well as &quot;normal&quot; internet access usage, is it worth going for a Super G AP ? would I need any special antennas ? What access point would I be best going for to acheive high transfer rates ?</p>									</div>

					<p>your transferrate will highly depend on the distance of the link, the sensitivity of your wifidevices and the gain of your antennas. <br />using two foneras for the link can be a good idea, the fonera has a atheros-wifi which has a good sensitivity, it´s much better than most broadcomdevices, it is quite cheap, and I think it has many settings to optimize long-distance-links. <br />I use a fonera as wifi-client myself. it´s placed in the flat of a friend and connects to the accesspoint (WL-500gP) in my flat. Both use their standard omidirectional antennas, there are some walls in between, and the distance is about 20-30 meters but I get a stable 6 Mbit link. But with free line of sight, and directional antennas with higher gain, you will get higher rates. </p><p>If the distance is´t too far, I would try to connect with the standard omnidirectional antennas, if this works you don´t need dedicated accesspoints, or special antennas for the link. <br />If doesn´t work, than you can try to connect with one directional antenna to the local wifi of the other location, so you only need one dedicated accesspoint, and one directional antenna. </p><p>and if it´s too far, than you have to use two dedicated accesspoints with two highgain-directional antennas. </p><p>I don´t think that extensions like super g would make a big difference, but using 11a-devices could be a good idea, because the 5GHz-band is not as crowded as the 2,4 Ghz where the 11b and 11g-devices, cordless phone, and things like that are running, and you have more channels, so you can use another, if you have interference.<br />On a long distance link the stability is more important than the transfererate, I think you would be much happier with a stable 2 Mbit link, than with a 54 Mbit link that only works sometimes <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for this info, I&#039;m quite decided to go for 2 fonera APs now but I&#039;m still not too sure about if I should use WDS or not.

					<p>What would you say is the best way to link 2 wireless AP to get the maximum transfer rates ? (Ignore distance between the APs). I want a wireless bridge, no routing between the different LANS.

					<p>If you go WET you&#039;ll &quot;lose&quot; one of the APs. One will be an AP that allows others to connect, and the WET router will ONLY allow a wired connection, and will connect to the internet (????) through the AP.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well it does yes, basically by half, but I think that would only count if you were connecting wirelessly using the PC3, which you are not. Basically when you have two devices connected (wirelessly) to one device the time it takes to go in and out of the router is much more delayed than if it were going from wired to wireless, or vice versa.</p>									</div>

					<p>ok so if I set up the APs fonera1 and fonera2 in WDS mode I won&#039;t see any delay in performance as long as an extra wireless device doesn&#039;t connect to one of the APs ? I&#039;m not sure I&#039;ve understood the issue involved in having an extra client.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you use the device as repeater (wireless uplink, und local accesspoint on one device) you always get only half bandwidth. </p><p>the best setup with the highest bandwidth with your number of devices could be to use fonera2 as ap, and fonera1 in sta-mode. so if you use pc3 you have the full bandwidth of the wireless link, and you can connect with wireless-clients to fonera2. so you can use full bandwidth from the wireless client to the fonera2 and to pc3. only the traffic of an wireless client connected to fonera2 which should go to house1 have to be sent twice. </p><p>but I think you have to route between house1 and house2 to achieve this.
