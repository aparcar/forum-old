					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;ve been using a Netgear DG843G V3 router for a while, but I only realized yesterday that it runs linux and I can install OpenWRT on it.</p><p>My question is: What would I benefit installing OpenWRT on this router ?</p><p>I think it would be really handy to use it for downloading whithout having to leave my computer on days and nights, however, I am not sure of what I can do with it since their is apparently no way to plug a hard drive on it...</p><p>On this page:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Netgear/DG834G">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har â€¦ ear/DG834G</a><br />it says that their is an &quot;unpopulated MiniPCI/VLYNQ connector&quot; does that mean that I can potentially add a miniPCI and use to plug hard drives or USB stuffs ? I didn&#039;t actually open my DG843G V3 yet ...</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Gerome.</p>									</div>
