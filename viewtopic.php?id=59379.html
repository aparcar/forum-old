					<p>Hey,</p><p>I&#039;ve been toying with VLAN&#039;s recently, and acquired some managed switches to be able to play further (TP-Link SG105E).<br />On the OpenWRT side there&#039;s a TPLink Archer C5 with BB.</p><p>There&#039;s one thing I&#039;ve noticed, and it&#039;s a constant: if i enable a tagged vlan on the switch of the router, the port where my my switch is on starts reporting a lot of RxBadPkt. Unfortunatly right now I have no idea what is &quot;bad&quot; about them.</p><p>I&#039;ve switched ports on the switch side, changed cables, so the only constant is the OpenWRt router. I&#039;ve been reading up on the ethernet layer, and it seems this might be an MTU issue, to do with the VLAN tags being inserted.<br />Is there something I can set to &quot;fix&quot; this behaviour, save for changing the MTU value on the routerswitch itself?</p>									</div>

					<p>hi</p><p>i think if you tagged a port on router you should trunc som ports on external switch<br />regarding MTU on router switch.. you cant chnage it.. its bugged<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/20425">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/20425</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Well, on the switch side I can select the VLAN&#039;s, but not much more. There&#039;s some option called &quot;MTU VLAN&quot;, but that reads very weird in the manual - and it has zero effect on the actual bad packet count.</p>									</div>
