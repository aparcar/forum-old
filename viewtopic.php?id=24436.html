					<p>Right, /overlay is what used to be /jffs. Also copy /rom/etc/opkg.conf to /etc/opkg.conf - this should solve the error above.</p>									</div>

					<p>I know this is old thread, but I want to know why copying /rom/etc/opkg.conf to /etc/opkg.conf solve the problem?</p><p>Just recently I flashed my old WRT54GL with Backfire 10.03.1 (brcm2.4) and the same thing happened to me. I read (...well skimmed) several wiki pages to understand the problem and if I understand correctly /overlay should be checked first for a file (opkg.conf in this case) and if it didn&#039;t exist then the one from /rom will be used. On my clean install of OpenWRT both /rom and /overlay has same opkg.conf&#039;s content, but still 0kb available. After &#039;cp /rom/etc/opkg.conf /overlay/etc/opkg.conf&#039; (NOT /etc/opkg.conf if I remember correctly) now suddenly I have 1.4MB available <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" />.</p><p>Thank you,<br />Namaku Jiro</p>									</div>

					<p>/rom is (was) pointing directly to the squashfs it cannot be modified.&nbsp; Mounting / to /rom means that your whole rootfs is only the immutable squashfs, thus there is no free space.</p><p>Script mount_root is provided in BB to remount with an overlay, which should be done automatically during the first boot once the jffs has been formatted, but I don&#039;t know if that is how earlier versions work.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 2 May 2015, 17:15)</p>
