					<p>Hi davidc502,</p><p>Props for putting time and effort to get these builds out. My thanks. I couldn&#039;t find contact details or anything so thought would post here.</p><p>I flashed latest image (10-09-2016 image). Noticed repeated wireless network becoming unavailable. To resolve would just power cycle. It seemed to be consistently bad in the evenings, sometimes a reboot would only resolve for a few minutes. After a few evenings of this I went back and flashed your 09-22-2016 build. Linksys ACS 1900. Not sure if its been noted but I wanted to drop you a note. Not of terrible utility (such lack of troubleshooting) but thought would share.</p><p>~delicatepc (not subscribed to thread)</p>									</div>
