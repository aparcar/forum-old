					<p>Recently I was told that my ISP has been handing out IPv6 addresses and I&#039;d like to get on board but I&#039;ve been having some issues.&nbsp; I found a post in my ISP&#039;s (Telus) forum that states the following:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>It will work fine, however there are a few issues with a majority of 3rd party devices. In order for it to work your device must:</p><p>1. Only request a dhcp6-pd (So only send IA-PD in the dhcp6 solicit message). This is what the Actiontecs actually do.</p><p>2. If the device does request both an IA-NA, and an IA-PD in the solicit message, then it must conform to RFC 7550. We are not using IA-NA so in our dhcp Advertise message there will be a NoAddrAvail message for the IA-NA, and a prefix for the IA-PD.</p><p>#2 is where most of the 3rd party devices have issues. They don&#039;t handle this case and will usually reject the dhcp advertise message that is sent down and just go into and endless solicit loop.</p></blockquote></div><p>From what I can find in the odhcp6c description this should be a supported situation.&nbsp; From <a href="https://github.com/sbyx/odhcp6c">https://github.com/sbyx/odhcp6c</a></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>1. IPv6 bootstrap from different environments with autodetection<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; a) RA only<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; b) RA + stateless DHCPv6<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; c) RA + stateful DHCPv6 (either IA_NA or IA_PD or both)</p></blockquote></div><p>The problem is that I&#039;m seeing the following error in my syslog:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Wed Aug 31 14:00:03 2016 daemon.warn odhcp6c[2276]: Server returned IA_PD status 6 (No prefixes have been assigned)</code></pre></div><p>According to the forum post (see above) this is likely due to odhcp6c not confirming to RFC 7550.&nbsp; In fact, I see the following pull request in the odhcp6c git:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/sbyx/odhcp6c/pull/39">https://github.com/sbyx/odhcp6c/pull/39</a></p><p>which appears to indicate that there might be a bug with how the process is handling this type of situation.</p><p>Regardless, I&#039;m trying to debug the error (to see where the issue lies) so I&#039;ve tried running the odhcp6c on the command line so I can see the console output but nothing is showing up.&nbsp; All I see is &quot;Command failed: Not found&quot; when I run the command and I start to see the &quot;No prefixes have been assigned&quot; in my syslog.</p><p>So, in a nutshell, can anyone suggest how to get odhcp6c to &quot;Only request a dhcp6-pd (So only send IA-PD in the dhcp6 solicit message)&quot; OR can anyone help me view the console output of the odhcp6c daemon?</p><p>I&#039;ve been banging my head against the wall for a few days!</p>									</div>

					<p>I think you are ready for some hard core troublshooting.</p><p>A) look at &#039;logread&#039; output, since odhcpd doesn&#039;t seem to give any &quot;console&quot; output. See if that tells you anything interesting.<br />B) sniff the WAN interface (with tcpdump) to see what is really happening between you and the provider. This will show if it is truly a RFC 7550 issue, or just a mis-configuration. An easy filter for tcpdump is the following (assuming your wan is eth2)<br />tcpdump -vvv -i eth2 ip6</p><p>If you want to save the output to a file, and look at it with wireshark which I find easier, use the following:<br />tcpdump -i eth2 -w /tmp/mycap.pcap ip6</p><p>Then look at the DHCPv6 request and advertisements from your provider. See what kind of error they are really sending.</p><p>HTH</p>									</div>
