					<p>Hi,</p><p>I just picked up a DSM-G600 from Circuit City for $99 and 300GB/16MB harddrive from CompUSA for about $79 after rebates.&nbsp; Not bad for under $200.&nbsp; I managed to get fun_plug working.</p><p>Vim put it DOS format by default on Windows so the script wasn&#039;t working... later I :set fileformat=unix and saved it then things started working.</p><p>Here&#039;s what I have:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

echo &quot;fun_plug executed at `date`&quot; &gt;&gt; /mnt/HD_a2/fun_plug.log


# busybox was posted here http://kwzs.be/busybox by Kevin (thanks)
# I wanted to see what&#039;s enabled for busybox
/mnt/HD_a2/busybox --help &gt; /mnt/HD_a2/busybox.log 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;


# Neither one of these two lines work for me, does anyone know why?
#/mnt/HD_a2/busybox nc -l -p 10023 -e /bin/sh &amp;
/mnt/HD_a2/busybox telnetd -p 23 -l /bin/sh -f /welcome.msg &amp;


# This was posted by loki (thanks)
sleep 20


# kill samba
/bin/smb stop


# Start samba and read the conf file on the hd
/usr/sbin/samba/smbd -D -s /mnt/HD_a2/smb.conf
/usr/sbin/samba/nmbd -D -s /mnt/HD_a2/smb.conf</code></pre></div><p>Anyway, telnet doesn&#039;t seem to work for me.&nbsp; Using busybox nc, I keep getting &quot;Command not found&quot; or something simliar messages when I type anything from the telnet session.&nbsp; The 2nd method using telnetd connects then terminals as soon as I type anything.</p><p>By the way, I&#039;m looking for toolchain for compiling utils for this box.&nbsp; Does anyone know where to find it?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Quang</p>									</div>

					<p>thanks for your hack sala and mchinand!<br />telnet on DSM works for me now.</p><p>yesterday i posted in the &quot;D-Link DSM-G600 Serial Console&quot; thread:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>hi i&#039;m new here - hello to all!</p><p>...new and got a question:</p><p>since i&#039;m not a linux developer (uuups, developers only!?!? sorry) i don&#039;t know, but would it be possible to integrate the paragon NTFS for linux driver (<a href="http://www.ntfs-linux.com/corporate/oem/">http://www.ntfs-linux.com/corporate/oem/</a>) into the DSM-G600 Firmware?</p><p>it&#039;s also available for MIPS and they did in rev.A.

					<p>thanks for ur quick answer. very good news thx! is the paragon NTFS driver included? or is there a linux NTFS r/w solution i dont know!?</p><p>im busy tonight but ill try NTFS tomorrow (GMT+1). Maybe ill also find time to try USB but since i never ever installed a USB printer at linux, it will take some reading for me before. anyway, maybe u would be so nice and post the binary?</p><p>whats about mldonkey? its written in objective CAML and i know there is a oCAML compiler for MIPS. so with my knowlege it should be possible to get it work at DSM, isn&#039;t it? Or do i think to easy?</p><p>thanks again for ur help and quick answer. ve a nice evening!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Ben06</strong> on 18 Aug 2006, 23:42)</p>

					<p>As far as I know, the NTFS r/w support comes from <a href="http://www.linux-ntfs.org">Linux NTFS</a>. It will either be the old &quot;dangerous&quot; full NTFS support that could corrupt the filesystem, or the newer, reduced functionality version, that doesn&#039;t let you do much.</p>									</div>

					<p>As for USB, I see that, while the Rev. A kernel has usbdevfs support, rev. B doesn&#039;t. This is a shame as I was hoping to get ftpd-topfield running on it, and that has a user-space driver.</p>									</div>
