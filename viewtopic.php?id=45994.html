					<p>Hello,</p><p>WR742N Really cheap but not powerfull enough wireless router (1MB Flash, 8MB RAM, Atheros 9331 SoC). I bought from China and its UI in Chinese. I am going to experiment on it so i decided to put my work on here so everybody can track it.</p><p>First thing to do, i guess is U-Boot mod for 9331 SoC to accomplish changing Flash IC.</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=43237">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=43237</a></p><p>I&#039;m going to update this topic, but i do not think its worth to work on this device for other users. So if you just a Regular user wanted to run openwrt on wr742n its not quite easy. Do not buy if you want to use openWRT on TP-LINK TL-WR742n. And i think it is going to be useful for Googlers for this device.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>I bought the WR742N. I didn&#039;t consider using openwrt when I picked it, but now I see it&#039;s not that exotic, I may actually be tempted. Part of the reason would be for the beauty of the experiment, and part for... getting a firmware in a language I understand! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>How did your experiments go?</p>									</div>
