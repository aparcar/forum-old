					<p>Hi Fellas, I am using Comfast WR150N wifi router cum repeater. I want to use my wifi in the library down the street (100 meters away). As mentioned on the box wifi uses a 2dbi antenna. But I hardy get any signals in the library. Is there any way that I could connect a high dB antenna to the wifi and increase the range? I know that there are some models especially for long range&nbsp; available in stores (like TP-Link TL-WA5210G) but Since my nature of work in the library is temporary I don&#039;t want to invest in those routers. So basically what I am looking for Is mod/hack so that I can radiate more power. <br />PS: I have seen some DIYs of using parabolic reflectors&nbsp; to boost signal strength. But what I am looking for is a higher power antenna.</p><p>I have Uploaded my Router pic here <a href="http://s22.postimg.org/6n5xlknpt/image_31554.jpg">http://s22.postimg.org/6n5xlknpt/image_31554.jpg</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>shikhar623</strong> on 18 Jul 2015, 17:18)</p>

					<p>Looks like you could remove C81 and solder a pigtail there or left of C78. Then you can connect any antenna you like.<br />Parabolic reflectors are providing pretty much the highest gain.

Thanks for a reply. <br />What I have&nbsp; understood till now is:<br />Step 1: solder&nbsp; (<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/2_mm_SMD_UFL_Socket.jpg">&nbsp; male hfl</a>) to the terminal marked Red in&nbsp; <a href="http://www.image-share.com/upload/3010/285.jpg">this image</a> <br />Step 2: insert the pigtail cable (female ufl side)&nbsp; into the male ufl (soldered on the PcB) <br />Step 3: connect the antenna to the free end of pigtail cable(sma) . <br />Please correct me if I&#039;m wrong.&nbsp; </p><p>Also Pls answer some queries. <br />1. From what I have studied i think that my signal strength will depend both upon the (a) current provided into the antenna and,&nbsp; (b) the antenna direcitvity&nbsp; <br />So is there anything i can do to increase the current provided to the antenna? (any high frequency amplifier available?)&nbsp; <br />2. What are these component marked C**? Capacitors? <br />3. You gave two locations to connect my pigtail cable. Is it a better option to use this red marked terminal than&nbsp; removing the C81 and using that terminal. <br />4.&nbsp; what is that golden/copper colored U shaped engraving on the top right corner of the PCB..?&nbsp; &nbsp;the antenna of the router?<br />5. I want to maximize my range so I will&nbsp; be using both external antenna and a parabolic reflector. Is it advisable?. <br />6. In The link you provided: the two links under the tile &#039;Antennas&#039;&nbsp; are not working. Can you provide the alternative links.&nbsp; <br />Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>I thought more about directly soldering a pigtail to the pcb, without the need for a connector. But that is up to your needs. Just remember to remove C81, so the pcb antenna will be disconnected.<br />About your questions:<br />1. I think active antennas (with amplifiers) are available, but usually not recommended. Amplifying the host signal won&#039;t help you, if the clients signal strength is too low for the host to receive anything.<br />2. C marked components are capacitors.<br />3. It seems TP-Link designed that red marked terminal to test the radio part. So, this can be reused. I expect they also do their tests with C81 removed. The capacitors in the group of C85 are for adapting the unusual impedance of the pcb antenna.<br />4. Yes, that is the pcb antenna.<br />5. Sure.

In the case of direct soldering of ufl cable to the PcB since that portion will be left unshielded will it cause any degradation of the signal.?<br />2. Since the ufl cable has two terminals inner wire (signal)&nbsp; and outer shield (ground). Where should the gnd be soldered?<br />3. I searched for some antennas online. There are antennas varying from 7db to 10db gain. Is that the max gain I can get from external antenna.? .. <br />4. Can I simply go for an antenna with&nbsp; highest dB?. .does choosing an antenna&nbsp; beyond certain dB degrade the signal quality??<br />5. I have this DTH reflector.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.solid4you.in/index.php?route=product/product&amp;path=20_64&amp;product_id=198">www.solid4you.in/index.php?route=product/product&amp;path=20_64&amp;product_id=198</a><br />I hope that will work..? <br />6.

					<p>1. If done right, there should not be an impact. See how TP-Link does it with the 1043ND: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/_media/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd-v16.jpg">http://wiki.openwrt.org/_media/toh/tp-l … nd-v16.jpg</a><br />2. There is all GND surface around the signal trace, so take the nearest spot.<br />3. I think to have read about ranges up to about 20 db with parabolic dishes. But you never know how reliable these measurements have been.<br />4. Higher db just means to focus on a smaller area. So usually, the higher, the better. The only problem you may encounter would be that if you operate a client in short distance and within the focus of the host, then the signal levels would be amplified out of range, so that strong parts will be cut off.<br />5. Give it a try.<br />6. The biquad is the better choice, as it is already focusing into one direction.</p>									</div>
