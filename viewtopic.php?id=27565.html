					<p>Thank you for being the first teachers of my OpenWRT education!&nbsp; As I wait for your suggestions to compile...</p><p>Jow - Question 1:&nbsp; I want to set menuconfig and kernel_menuconfig back to the default (how is was when downloaded from SVN).&nbsp; Can I just copy over .config from the pristine download I saved?&nbsp; What about the config for kernel_menuconfig, or is that the same file.&nbsp; I want to trouble-shoot methodically one small step at a time, but instead I am compiling your suggestions along with all of the other changes I previously made to menuconfig.</p><p>Jow - Question 2:&nbsp; In &quot;make target/linux/clean world V=99&quot; is it important for me to know what &quot;target/linux/clean work&quot; is right now?&nbsp; Before I just did &quot;make V=99&quot;.</p><p>Mazilo - I agree.&nbsp; The problem is I&#039;m located in rural Uganda, there are limited router choices, and no money, but there is a computer with a celeron and 64MB ram.&nbsp; Our 3G network will vastly increase in speed, but with a capacity cap.&nbsp; My organization will likely zip right through the cap so I need to implement some Quality of Service rules.&nbsp; The current router can&#039;t do that, so I have to find a creative solution.&nbsp; That does give me an idea though: I should do some electrical load tests to calculate just what the financial difference is.&nbsp; Ill need a psychologist to determine the mental differences and an educator to determine the personal educational gain.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, my brain is on and I&#039;ve had my coffee.
