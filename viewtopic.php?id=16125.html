					<p>I have SquareOne sq-201. From what I have learned it is Gemini platform based on Storlink SL3516 chip.* I see that there is some development going on for gemini boards on the trunk svn, the wili boards 111 and 222.&nbsp; Maybe someone would be interested to port openwrt to sq-201? I am interested. I&#039;ll post some pics of hardware of mine box. Booting is done thru RedBoot os.</p><p>Winyl</p>									</div>
