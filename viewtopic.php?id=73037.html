					<p>I don&#039;t like the &quot;join&quot; button does.&nbsp; I prefer to configure manually.&nbsp; Go to wifi and create a client interface with the SSID and encryption matching the AP you want to use.&nbsp; Attach it to the &#039;wan&#039; network, which exists by default even in a single Ethernet port device.&nbsp; Be sure the overall wifi radio enable is enabled.&nbsp; Then go to network interfaces wan physical settings and uncheck the bridge box and make your wifi client the only thing in wan.&nbsp; A regular AP-client link will not work in a bridge.</p><p>If you are in range of the AP the main status page should show a WAN IP address has been obtained.&nbsp; If this address is in the 192.168.1.X range you will need to change the LAN from the default of 192.168.1.1 to something in another range like 192.168.2.1.</p><p>This configuration is called a &quot;routed client&quot;.&nbsp; The router gives you your own LAN.&nbsp; The AP you connected to is used as the link to the Internet instead of a wired modem.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 20 Jan 2018, 00:04)</p>
