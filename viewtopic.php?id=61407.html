					<p>im not sure it&#039;s a nat related problem<br />is your server outside nat?<br />anyway, inside it or outside, it&#039;s not a right way to test throughput by manipulating with smth at the router host<br />to measure real values use two different machines connected to router, from machine to machine</p>									</div>
