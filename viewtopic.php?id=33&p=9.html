					<p>Im sorry to be just one more posting about problems but i think i really messed something up .. i guess in the end there was a reason god made Windows Systems Admins and Unix ones ......</p><p>I flashed the WGT634U according to the instructions at <a href="http://openwgt.informatik.hu-berlin.de/installation.php">http://openwgt.informatik.hu-berlin.de/installation.php</a></p><p>Followed the procedure for the NVRAM:<br />$ nvram set lan_proto=static<br />$ nvram set lan_ifname=vlan0<br />$ nvram set lan_ipaddr=192.168.1.2<br />$ nvram set lan_netmask=255.255.255.0<br />$ nvram set lan_gateway=192.168.1.254<br />$ nvram set lan_dns=192.168.1.254<br />$ nvram set lan_domain=lan.home<br />$ nvram show | grep lan_<br /># Start watchdog, since a commit crashs sometimes the kernel<br />$ watchdog<br />$ nvram commit</p><p>And to my great discontent, i noticed that it applied the network 192.168.1.0 to the whole 5 ports of the router ... eeeckkkk , having in mind that my isp deals the IP on a dynamic base the WAN port should be getting it via DHCP wich it doesnt, furthermore now i cant connect to the internet to rollback onto the old version of the netgear firmware.</p><p>Can anyone enlighten me on what to do ? Please :$</p><p>Another odd thing is that there is a bit of a mixup on the image and the suposed id of the WAN port wich i seem to see on some pages that its suposed to be VLAN1 but i cant find reference of it anywhere.<br />Digging up a bit i think the problem can be a faulty config on the Setup VLAN&nbsp; /etc/init.d/S39vlan and on the S40.<br />Can someone give me a hand ?</p><p>Best Regards</p><p>Francisco</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi everybody.</p><p>I just flashed my WGT634U with the kamikaze latest build; but the thing is that I have selected a 2.4 kernel.</p><p>Is there any way to change the firmware to a different one or at least revert to the Official Netgear firmware to reimplement an openwrt firmware.</p><p>The thing is that I have no serial cable. Is there a way to do it without it?</p><p>thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Please, do NOT FLASH without having an serial cable!<br />You NEED an serial cable cause only with this thingy you can access the cfe to upload the old netgear.<br />for openwgt, there was a function to revert, for openwrt, imho there isn&#039;t one....</p>									</div>
