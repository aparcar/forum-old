					<p>I&#039;ve recently bought two Linksys WRT1900ACS routers, one of which I&#039;m using as a main router and the other I&#039;m using as a &#039;dumb AP.&#039; I flashed them both with davidc502&#039;s May 12th build. I followed the wiki instructions to set up a dumb AP (except adding the WAN port to the LAN interface, I&#039;m not using it) and I&#039;ve disabled multicast snooping per it&#039;s instructions.</p><p>Wirelessly, I have two Canon printers connected to the network which both have AirPrint functionality built in, and they do appear on the everyone&#039;s Apple devices most of the time. However, once every day or two, the printers will both randomly disappear on everyone&#039;s device until I turn off all printers &amp; routers, turn on the routers, and then turn on the printers. I&#039;ve tried finding reasons for why they both disappear but I find no patterns. Both printers have IP&#039;s reserved for their MAC address.</p><p>I&#039;ve searched for many solutions related to multicast forwarding, multicast snooping, etc. but I&#039;ve still come up empty with solutions. The printers do not appear on everyone&#039;s phones all the time and it&#039;s getting frustrating since there is a business run out of my home that is based primarily on Apple&#039;s mobile devices. The AirPrint technology is based off of Apple&#039;s Bonjour/Zeroconf networking and software like &#039;avahi-browse -all&#039; lists all the AirPrint enabled printers, Apple TV&#039;s, iPhones, iPads, etc. Does anyone have any clue why this might be happening?</p>									</div>
