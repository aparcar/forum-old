					<p>@johan666:<br />Thanks.&nbsp; <br />All I want to do is using the Openwrt 703n as an processor for the network and use it as an adapter for an wired ethernet adapter, e.g. as a remote wireless webcam.&nbsp; I really don&#039;t meed it to be a wifi repeater but on an ethernet repeater.&nbsp; Do you think the regular Openwrt client mode will work?&nbsp; One more thing, if you set up the relayd repeater, can the device on the main network access the 703n in the repeater mode.<br />(BTW, I am taking a few days off so I am on line all the time right now :-) .)</p>									</div>

					<p>If you don&#039;t need wifi repeating, no problem and no additional setup is needed.<br />Why you ask will it work ?&nbsp; what kind of problem you think will occur ?<br />In my case, my Plasma TV only have ethernet connection, so I plug client mode 703n so that my TV can access my DLNA server wirelessly.<br />And of coz I do repeating to extend wifi coverage...... although my existing coverage is enough.<br />Somehow it is just for &quot;fun&quot; in getting familiar in configuration rather than actual needed.</p><p>In relayd repeating, of coz I can reach my device.<br />However, in the repeating zone I make it both AP and STA side unreachable to my device,<br />as a result I can&#039;t reach the devices in repeating zone too, separate my network to them. <br />Of coz you can make them reachable if you need.<br />In this case, no firewall is invoked.<br />I think only openwrt can do that, interesting huh !</p>									</div>

Telnet into 703n using ethernet cable.<br />2. Edit the file /etc/config/network using vi (or any other editor if it is available).<br />3. Change the static ip address to any ip address that is not used in your home network.&nbsp; For example, if your home network gateway has the ip address of 192.168.a.1, you can change your router ip to 192.168.a.x as long as this address is not used by any other device on the network.<br />4. do &quot;/etc/init.d/network restart&quot; from telnet or restart the router.<br />5. See if you can telnet into 703n at 192.168.a.x instead of 192.168.1.1.<br />6. If you can, connect 703n to your home network.&nbsp; In one of the computers on the network, telenet into 192.168.a.x. Once you are connected into 703n from the computer on the home network, do &quot;opkg update&quot;.<br />7. If opkg update works, do &quot;opkg install luci&quot;.<br />8. Do &quot;/etc/init.d/uhttpd enable&quot; and &quot;/etc/init.d/uhttpd start&quot;<br />9. Now you can connect to the 703n using a browser with the address 192.168.a.x<br />10.&nbsp; You can then do what ever you need to from the web interface.&nbsp; You can reflash the original firmware also.&nbsp; On the other hand, if you want to try openwrt, you can enable wifi through the web interface in the network/wifi section and do anything else you want to do from there.&nbsp; (If you enable wifi, change the power to 18 or 20 dBm.&nbsp; The default value is too high.)<br />Everything should work fine.&nbsp; If you hang at any steps, please let me know and I will be happy to help as much as I can.<br />Good Luck.<br />PS.&nbsp; Also, if anybody found there&#039;s any incorrect steps above, please let me know also.</p>									</div>
