					<p>hi all,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;am new here. I wanted to buy a WRT54GL , but it is not available with my local distributor. Could anyone suggest what could be the closest in match to WRT54GL, so that i can get my hands on it and start working. I need to run Linux, and get some of my stacks on to the Board. Thanks for your time.</p><p>Cheers,<br />Voice~Streams.</p>									</div>

					<p>I suggest you look through the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware">TableOfHardware</a> and look at the specs and models and see what meets your needs that is also available from you local distributor. Maybe get a list of what they have availalble and then compare it to this table to see what looks best for you.</p><p>Also, if you really want or need a wrt54gl for some reason, is there a reason you can&#039;t order it online?</p>									</div>

					<p>Why not buy the ASUS WL-500G Deluxe. </p><p>It is priced at appx the same level as the Linksys WRT54GL, and includes the same CPU and 32 MB of RAM instead of 16MB.</p><p>Additionally it includes 2xUSB 2.0 interfaces, allowing you to attach external storage, printers and webcams.</p>									</div>
