					<p>I never install package firewall. Only using my private rules for iptables.<br />Note, however, that you might need to install the required kernel modules yourself, as not all are<br />installed by default. I.e. conntrack is not always present by default, but might be auto installed when using firewall.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, there must be something else installed that I&#039;ve not noticed when also adding firewall. It only works when I install both packages.</p>									</div>

					<p>May be, you need packages<br />kmod-ipt-conntrack<br />kmod-ipt-nat</p><p>to be installed. <br />May be, even<br />kmod-ipt-nat-extra<br />depending on, what you want to do.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>augustus_meyer</strong> on 30 Mar 2018, 08:54)</p>

					<p>The <em>firewall</em> package is just a series of scripts that use <em>iptables</em> to configure a firewall, according to the configuration at <em>/etc/config/firewall</em>; it also loads all needed kernel modules, and that is probably what you are missing, as the error says. You probably need to execute <em>insmod iptable_nat</em> or some other module before calling <em>iptables</em>.</p>									</div>

					<p>I didn&#039;t have to do anything but install the firewall package and everything started working. <br />I wanted to ask in case I missed something. Seems to be working fine so I guess this question is moot.</p><p>Thanks for the input, it was appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>This happened again. The solution was as mentioned above, installing</p><p>kmod-ipt-nat and kmod-ipt-nat-extra.</p><p>Now iptables commands for nat work.</p><p>Thanks again.</p>									</div>
