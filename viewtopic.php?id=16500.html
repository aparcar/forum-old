					<p>Hi</p><p>I want to port openwrt to the smc 7804wbrb, but there is a problem with the serial connection:<br />I can read the router&#039;s boot messages without problems, but I cannot send anything.</p><p>There is no serial port on my computer, so I decided to use a cut off DKU-5 cable with the PL2303 (USB-to-TTL33).<br />First, I connected VCC and GND to the appropriate pins in order to power the PL2303.<br />After that, a loop back test worked (cable-tx &lt;--short--&gt; cable-rx).</p><p>Then, I connected router-tx to cable-rx. Also works.<br />I can now read the router&#039;s boot messages.</p><p>Amongst them there is: &#039;Press any key to enter boot menu&#039;, so I briefly connected router-rx to ground, just to see if I had identified the correct pin, and that worked also.<br />The boot menu showed up.</p><p>Now I thought it would be obvious: connect cable-tx to router-rx ...<br />...but this does NOT work. As soon as I do this, the connection seems dead.<br />No sending, no receiving, nothing.</p><p>Does anybody _please_ have any clues?</p>									</div>

					<p>I was going to say &quot;turn off hardware flow control&quot;, but if both sending and receiving stop when you connect up the router-rx, I don&#039;t know...</p>									</div>
