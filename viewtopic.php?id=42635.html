					<p>I have a working Seagate DockStar unit running on a self-built OpenWRT + FreeSWITCH firmware and is connected to my NAT/Firewall router. What I would like to experiment is to turn another Seagate DockStar unit into an IPv4 and/or IPv6 NAT/Firewall router by adding a USB/RJ45 dongle. So, I bought some <a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-Shipping-USB-2-0-to-RJ45-10M-100M-Lan-Ethernet-Adapter-For-Mac-Win7-XP/584355345.html">USB 2.0 to RJ45 10M/100M Lan Ethernet Adapters</a>. It is based on a Davicom DM9601 USB 10/100 Ethernet device. It works just fine on my Seagate Dockstar to connect to my main NAT/Firewall router. According to this <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network">network configuration</a> (OpenWRT wiki doc), I don&#039;t need include a <em>switch</em> section mainly because a Seagate DockStar simply lacks some capabilities of a switch. Then, I just added a <em>route</em> section to forward packets between the two RJ45 ports. So, I concocted a simple <em>/etc/config/network</em> file to route packets between the two RJ45 ports, i.e. eth1 (USB/RJ45 dongle) to eth0 (RJ45 on a Seagate DockStar), as shown below and it doesn&#039;t work.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;loopback&#039;
