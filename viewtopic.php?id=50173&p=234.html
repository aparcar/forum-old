Yes it is 1x1. Well i did used to be able to get sustained speeds of over 20MB for large size file transfer.. Perhaps the app used was generous in telling me the speed!.<br />I am on channel 149 80MHZ. Its the cleanest spectrum around me.</p></blockquote></div><p>My hunch is it was human error in the coding of the app, as an algorithm is used to determine the actual speed per second.&nbsp; Whenever we see xx/s it&#039;s not actually downloading/uploading at that specific speed, but is an average of the speed of the sent/received packets.&nbsp; The raw values are plugged into an algorithm, which then gives us human output we can make sense of.&nbsp; </p><p>There is another possibility, which is the NX5 utilizes wifi and bluetooth together to speed up the transfer of data.&nbsp; I forget what the technology is called (bluetooth coexistence maybe?), but I know Intel has incorporated this specific technology into their wifi cards for the past half decade or so (as have broadcom and others).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>JW0914</strong> on 25 Jun 2015, 15:40)</p>
