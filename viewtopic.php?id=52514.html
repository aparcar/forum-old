					<p>I am not sure if I understood you right. But if you are asking if some random adapters plugged into each other will create a computer that OpenWrt (or any other OS) will run on: No, they won&#039;t.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 2 Sep 2014, 04:01)</p>

					<p>No.</p><p>These sticks are extensions to a host computer, they cannot become a computer on their own.</p><p>Also, just because the connectors of items fit into each other does not mean they actually work with each other. Just because there exists the possibility to carry power through an RJ45 port doesn&#039;t mean that any machine with an RJ45 port can be powered through an RJ45 port. In fact, only very few machines are equipped to support that.</p><p>Or to put it another way: You are trying to get four wheels and a gas tank and expect it to make a car just because the nuts and bolts happen to fit together.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 3 Sep 2014, 22:55)</p>
