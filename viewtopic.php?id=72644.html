					<p>Hi,<br />I got the same problem as lordcapy (see forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=70498 ): I have a TP-Link MR200 v1 from an ISP (Orange) who put on a custom version of the 0.9.1_00 TP-link firmware. Like lordcapy, I want to put on a regular version of the firmware on the device and also upgrade it to version 1.6</p><p>I read wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/archer-mr200#oem_installation_using_the_tftp_method which decribed roughly how I need to to do the sysupgrade (especially since simply uploading it via the web-based interface (url address 192.168.1.1) doesn&#039;t work (it gives the error: 4503: the uploaded file was not accepted).</p><p>Setting up a tftp server seems easy enough but having a pre-made version of the 160412 EU version of the firmware for the v1 MR200 (see static.tp-link.com/res/down/soft/Archer_MR200(EU)_V1_160412.zip ) would be useful and make things a lot safer for me and other MR200 users.</p><p>Is such a file available via the openwrt website ?<br />If it isn&#039;t available, is this because it isn&#039;t legal to post such a file (I thought the file was made available under the GPL 3 license since there&#039;s a GPL booklet supplied with the device) ? Even if the firmware isn&#039;t entirely open-source, is it still illegal to post the file (given that we wouldn&#039;t alter the firmware, just change it somewhat to make it able to be accepted by the router via tftp) ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>flybox</strong> on 29 Nov 2017, 15:38)</p>

					<p>The question remains whether I can do the sysupgrade (well actually &quot;factory install&quot;, reading forum.lede-project.org/t/firmware-lede-install-url-for-tp-link-archer-mr200/2667) on a way that is convenient and safe.</p><p>I read that I need to:<br />download the sysupgrade file, then download the tp-link firmware and then cut the tp-link header from the stock firmware (using a hex editor ?), extract the Das U-boot bootloader from the firmware, and append the sysupgrade firmware, rename, the file and put it on the tftp server.</p><p>I&#039;m not going to do any modifying of the file myself, since that brings the risk that I could corrupt the file and make it brick my router when I upload it.<br />So my question is; can I just use a certain file that I can upload as is using the tftp server ? I&#039;m thinking on the lede-ramips-mt7620-ArcherMR200-squashfs-sysupgrade<br />or the Archer_MR200(EU)_V1_160412.zip</p><p>I was thinking that for the &quot;factory install&quot;, the boot loader, ... would need to be present ? So, it would not be needed to strip this of or do any more modifications on the file, and I could upload it as is ? Or won&#039;t that work ?</p><p>Also, I&#039;m not sure whether the file will actually upload at all, given that orange seems to have implemented some sort of write protection, preventing file uploads (see lordcapy&#039;s post, and my first post above).</p>									</div>

					<p>Personally I wouldn&#039;t attempt it without a ttl serial cable, and even then with no 5ghz radio that seems to me to be a lot to go through to not have that.</p>									</div>
