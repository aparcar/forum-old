					<p>Hi, I&#039;m using the trunk version of Openwrt on my WGT634U and Asterisk18 and it works really well. I would however like to be able to use PrivacyManager but this isn&#039;t one of the available packages.<br />Would anyone be able to provide/compile it for me or could it be made available in the repository? Many thanks....and loads of thanks to the team of developers who work on OpenWrt and its packages, much appreciated.</p><p>Mark</p>									</div>
