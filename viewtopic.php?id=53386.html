					<p>Folks,</p><p>I am looking for a way to use dynamic URL filtering on behalf of DNS queries. I lalready use Opendns, but the filtering is static for the complete network.</p><p>OpenDNS offers together with Netgear &#039;Live Parental Control&#039; which seems to support some kind of dynamic filtering with individual settings for hosts within the same network (I don&#039;t know if it is on basis of MAC, IP or maybe individual USer credentials).</p><p>As OpenDNS use the public IP as reference for their filter settings, it would be easy to adjust with multiple static IPs (which you will not get as a &#039;standard&#039; consumer from your ISP).</p><p>As Netgear offers this feature together with their routers, even for those &#039;standard&#039; customers, I assume they use some kind of tagging for the DNS requests. Does anybody know how to use this with OpenWRT and what needs to be ordered at OpenDNS to support it?</p><p>Regards</p><p>P.S.: just found the Netgear manual. It seems there are just two options: using the OpenDNS URL filtering or just &#039;bypass&#039; it. So again assumption: either the bypass acount is just forwarded to a different DNS or Netgear uses a kind of IP anonymizer which changes the public IP address of the requesting bypass account...building both should not be an issue with OpenWRT</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>schlamassl</strong> on 16 Oct 2014, 12:48)</p>

					<p>what means dynamic URL filtering? I&#039;m using free opendns account, I&#039;ve set filtering level moderate (Protects against all adult-related sites and illegal activity. ), but also can block domains defined by myself which is updated in ~3 min.</p><p>about static ip: opendns support also dynamic ip addresses with ddns, see here:<br /><a href="https://support.opendns.com/entries/24889200-Dynamic-IP-Addresses-Technical-Detail-and-FAQ">https://support.opendns.com/entries/248 … il-and-FAQ</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi isemionov,</p><p>I meant assigning individual URL filtering rules to single (!) clients or maybe subnets. If you google for &#039;Netgear&#039; and &#039;Live Parental Control&#039; you will see, what I mean: beside the network-wide filtering policy you can assign single clients to override filtering.</p><p>Netgear restricts that to Win machines with their client software, OpenDNS offers their own product with a client for Win and Mac machines.<br />The OpenDNS offer includes another option with Active Directory integration, but for that you need to run an AD server and a virtual appliance of OpenDNS...all of it not easy to handle in my eyes.</p><p> Ia m thinking of a solution where Dnsmasq directs DNS requests to separate servers or just &#039;tags&#039; the requests on behalf of the MAC address. Using a different DNS for overriding the filtering would not be an issue, but on the other hand it would be nice to just use a separate ruleset which means you have to direct these requests to OpenDNS as well...and then the question; how to differentiate between those requests as they all use the same IP? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /></p>									</div>

					<p>maybe I didn&#039;t get your point, but if it is just about specific IPs in your private network to avoid filtering I&#039;m doing it by assigning them google dns servers while the rest get OpenDNS: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=201038#p201038">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 38#p201038</a></p><p>also take a look here (might be useful for you): <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=35023">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=35023</a></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>schlamassl wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>and then the question; how to differentiate between those requests as they all use the same IP? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /></p></blockquote></div><p>I don&#039;t think it is possible while using one external ip, because as far as I understood OpenDNS differentiate the requests (and applying specific rules sets) only by ip</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>isemionov</strong> on 16 Oct 2014, 20:08)</p>

					<p>no, you perfectly get it! I am elaborating if there is any (easy) way of using OpenDNS for filtered and non-filtered traffic for the same network. But obviously this needs either to use their client software or to do some Active Directory work. Both oversized for my needs.The way you described looks good.<br />Thanks for your links.</p><p>Regards</p>									</div>
