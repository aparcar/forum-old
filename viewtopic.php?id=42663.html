					<p>I need a second router for my home network. Can someone please advice which router to buy with at least 4 gigabit ports + 1 usb port + wi-fi n (300mbs?!) + recommended/compatible with OpenWrt and worth the money? I also don&#039;t need a WAN port (though it could be there) as I use my first router for this purpose.</p><p>I tried to choose some random router based purely on specs for example TP-Link WR2543ND but after a quick research it appeared it had too slow CPU (why do I need faster CPU? for torrents?). There are so many routers listed here...<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start</a></p><p>Thank you in advance</p>									</div>

					<p>I would go for TP-LINK WDR 4310. CPU 560 Mhz, dual band radio, 128 meg ram, 8 mb flash, dual usb ports and 5 gig e ports at low price makes it my choice.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ron</strong> on 4 Mar 2013, 13:46)</p>

					<p>Thanks for a prompt reply.</p><p>Specs look fantastic considering its price. My local dealer lists it as WDR4300.
