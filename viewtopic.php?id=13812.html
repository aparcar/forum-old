					<p>I&#039;ve got an openwrt box that&#039;s got a home wireless subnet (the wl0 is a client, not an AP) on one side and home gigabit subnet on the other. (Kamikaze 7.09 on the 2.4/broadcom kernel). I&#039;m running iTunes and TiVo Desktop on the wired side and I&#039;d like to make them visible to the wireless side. (e.g. I&#039;d like wireless laptops&#039; iTunes to be able to play the big collection sitting on the gigabit LAN. Also n.b. My TiVo Series 2 is on the wireless side.) It looks like avahi fits the bill, and it&#039;s supposedly ported to openwrt (supposedly even to kamikaze), but I can&#039;t find a kamikaze ipkg anywhere. I did, however, find howl-mdnsresponder available as an ipkg. </p><p>What&#039;s the status of avahi on kamikaze 7.09? Is there a package available, or is it only build-from-source at the moment?</p><p>What else besides avahi would be useful for forwarding zeroconf/bonjour/mDNS (i.e. iTunes sharing and TiVo Desktop beacon) across subnets on kamikaze? howl? Something completely different?</p><p>Is there already some sort of soup-to-nuts HOWTO that I&#039;ve missed?</p><p>(Ideally, I would have liked wl0 and br-lan/eth0 to have been on the same subnet with wl0 as a client or maybe as a WDS. But I haven&#039;t had any luck with that approach and I&#039;m gonna be remote from the openwrt box for a couple of weeks, so I don&#039;t dare mess with it for a while. I&#039;ve got two subnets, some simple SNAT and portforwards. It works, which means my wife won&#039;t kill me for now :-) )</p><p>Since this is my first post to the forum, I&#039;d like to thank everybody involved with creating and improving OpenWRT. I haven&#039;t had this kind of geeky thrill since my first time using ipchains! (On a 486!)</p>									</div>

					<p>misha680, I looked under <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/packages-mips/packages/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … /packages/</a> (I&#039;ve got an WRT54GL). Is that the right place? Thanks for the pointer!</p>									</div>

					<p>Following up my own post: The wrt54gl takes mipsel, not mips, architecture. The snapshot packages can be found in <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/packages-mipsel/packages/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … /packages/</a></p><p>Any suggestions for the best way to use snapshot packages? Should I add a line to /etc/ipkg.conf for the snapshot directory? Or just download the ipkg manually and install it (and its dependencies) manually?</p>									</div>

					<p>I just download them manually and install them. I suppose you could add the snapshots directory to ipkg, not sure about the pros/cons though (would snapshot packages then replace stable 7.09 packages that are in both? that&#039;s probably not what you want, but I&#039;m not sure there&#039;s any overlap; in fact thinking of the way source is structured I don&#039;t think so but I&#039;m not 100% sure honestly)</p><p>Misha</p>									</div>
