					<p>Hi, I just flashed my WA830RE v1 with the trunk snapshot openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wa830re-v1-squashfs-factory.bin from yesterday (27-Mar-2013).</p><p>You can easily do this by using the original firmware&#039;s web interface, where you can simply upload the bin file.</p><p>It looks like everything is working nice.</p><p>One note: there is no LuCI installed in this build. So if you want a WebUI, you have to install it via shell (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials">LuCI Essentials</a>).</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> I am happy with the WA830RE on OpenWRT. I am using it simply as a WDS Repeater providing also Internet at its RJ45 Port for my mediacenter. I could have done this with the original firmware, but it works much more stable now than with the original. The original firmware jammed my whole wifi network totally every 4 hours or something like that. Now it is running for nearly two days without any problem.</p><p>The only issue I recognized was, that LuCI generated a 500 Server Error with the message &quot;could not allocate memory&quot; after I played a lot with the interface configuration. I decided to not autostart LuCI because it eats 4 MB of the 28 MB total memory. And OpenWRT alone needs about 20 MB.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>niun</strong> on 29 Mar 2013, 22:02)</p>

					<p>Hi, I have two questions:<br />1) Does openwrt support Airprint? I am considering to switch to it because the original stock WA830RE firmware does not propagate my Airprint enabled HP printer.<br />2) After having flashed the modem, would it be possible to revert it back to the original stock firmware?</p><p>Thank you very much for your support!<br />Alessandro</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>opiu</strong> on 25 May 2013, 19:12)</p>
