					<p>Sorry I forgot to mentions I always from from trunk and current target is BCM2709 (RBPi2) and will be experimenting withAllwinner A83T (banana pi m3) . The main issue musl I ran it to is. Musl has very strip down headers. For example mutex initializers. I <br />PTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INITIALIZER_NP . Also breaks lots of custom packages I been maintaining, like lua-zmq , zeromq and other luarock packages (I have a hack for luarock to compile in openwrk, I might want to see if there i better solution) .&nbsp; As a test do you know what I can temp patch to re-enable uclibc for ARM. Also I got little scared when my software ram foot print double in size using glibc.&nbsp; Thanks for the info.</p>									</div>
