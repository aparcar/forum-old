					<p>I was looking around for a wireless card (no, I&#039;m not asking for suggestions) and I came accross the Prism54 kernel driver.&nbsp; Which then led me to the Prism54.org site.&nbsp; Looking at their supported interface tables, the Linksys WRT54G is supposedly supported by that driver.</p><p>Now, there&#039;s an up side and a sown side to this.&nbsp; It seems external, non-GPL firmware is required for use with the Prism54 driver, so a working package can&#039;t be distributed as far as I know.</p><p>With that said, I&#039;m wondering if anybody has attempted to use the Prism54 driver with the WRT54G?&nbsp; A possible advantage to this would be the use of iwspy so we can scan for subnets.&nbsp; But I&#039;m not even sure if the Prism54 driver would provide this capability.</p><p>Anywho...has anybody tried it?&nbsp; &gt;8)</p>									</div>

					<p>The wrt54g has no relation to the prism54 driver or intersil 802.11g/a chipset.&nbsp; wrt54g and gs use a proprietary broadcom chipset.</p><p>i am typing this from a laptop with a prism54 802.11g card in it using my wrt54g as the basestation, perhaps that is what someone meant by &quot;supported&quot;</p><p>I recommend prism54 equipment as its driver is open source.&nbsp; The firmware is required to use the cards because the cards don&#039;t have a flash rom on them.&nbsp; You&#039;ll have that problem no matter what card you use.&nbsp; the prism54 firmware is widely available.</p>									</div>

					<p>Here&#039;s a thought: replace the Broadcom miniPCI card with a Prism54-based miniPCI card and use the prism54.org drivers. Of course, this would only work with the WRT54G v1 or the Belkin F5D7230-4 that actually has the wireless chipset in a miniPCI slot and not soldered to the main PCB. Anyone tried that?</p>									</div>

					<p>I seem to recall seeing somwhere that some of the old WRT54G&#039;s either shipped with Prism based chips, or you could swap the Broadcom chip for a Prism miniPCI card. I believe that is why it is listed on the table.</p>									</div>
