					<p>Hello everybody !</p><p>&nbsp; I have a movistar ADB home station router : ADB P.DG A4001N, which I installed openwrt-15.05-brcm63xx-generic-A4001N-squashfs-cfe.bin on it, But after reboot I have no access to it.</p><p>&nbsp; I figured out that I make a mistake : I flashed it without an RJ-45 cable and no IP addresses configuration ! directly via wireless network.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; I tried the failsafe in the openWrt documentation : they say that one or more of the SYS LED will blink, but in my case they flash one time when I power on the router, after that just the power LED steel on for 10-15 seconds and off for 2-3 seconds and steel on until I make the power off (no blink) so I can&#039;t trigger the time to activate failsafe.</p><p> When I connect the router to my laptop directly via RJ-45 without setting my Ethernet interface for 192.168.1.2 and a gateway 192.168.1.1 :&nbsp; the configuration of the Ethernet Interface of my laptop for 169.254.197.170 and a mask of 255.255.0.0 but network unidentifiable ?!</p><p>&nbsp; Can anyone help me ?</p>									</div>
