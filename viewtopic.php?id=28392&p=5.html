					<p>I have noticed something similar when switching between Backfire Luci 0.10 and Trunk Luci trunk via firmware flash. They have different icon sets etc. and sometimes the displays do not refresh properly in Firefox (9.0a2) after the flash unless doing the manual refresh.

					<p>Here&#039;s a quick script to show the config file differences a little more clearly by fixing up the single quotes first.

					<p>Sounds great! I plan to poke around the uci stuff in more detail, the &quot;-m import&quot; and &quot;add&quot; options look interesting. I&#039;m thinking the diff script can generate something that can be mangled into a uci file that can capture changed settings.

					<p>Interesting, I first thought that it would be some minor change in kernel between rc6 and today, but I noticed that Backfire r29399 crashes even when I try to install a self-compiled additional package.

I will search for the regression point, but this looks like a real regression either with Backfire sources or one of the add-on modules (like the changed Busybox version etc.).</p><p>EDIT: looks rather strange, as a newly recompiled r28681 also fails.

					<p>I wrote a longer story to the Openwrt-devel mailing list, but based on my debug work so far, it looks like the kernel version of the underlying buildsystem for some reason has impact on the kernel configuration (?) of the firmware to be compiled. And as Ubuntu 11.10 has kernel 3.0, that breaks things compared to the 2.6 kernel in Ubuntu 11.04 (and in Backfire).</p><p><a href="https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/2011-December/013100.html">https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/ope … 13100.html</a></p><p>There might be an actual problem with kernel config with the 11.10 compiled version. Around line 29300-30000 of the log there is the part with scripts/kconfig. And there the 11.04 version log talks about /boot/config-2.6.38-12-generic, while the 11.10 log contains /boot/config-3.0.0-13-generic. That difference then causes several differences for the various kernel build option selections made by the build process. </p><p>Neither of those versions mentioned in the build log is actually the 2.6.32.27, which the Backfire kernel actually is.</p><p>Apparently the /boot/config... file mentioned in the build log below is from the buildhost system, not from the Openwrt source.

					<p>I have updated the Backfire version to r29594. That matches the code of the final Backfire 10.03.1 release, as r29594 is the tagging of the 10.03.1 release at the svn repository, made today. (The official 10.03.1 version can be said to be 29592 instead, but it is the same Backfire code.) My build should also match the LuCI version of the final 10.03.1, as LuCI r8131 is the tag of &quot;0.10.0&quot; in LuCI svn.</p><p>Backfire 10.03.SVN (r29594) / LuCI 0.10 Branch (0.10+svn8131)<br /><a href="http://koti.welho.com/hnyman1/Openwrt/backfire-r29594-2011-12-21-release-10.03.1/">http://koti.welho.com/hnyman1/Openwrt/b … e-10.03.1/</a></p><br /><p>Trunk:<br />with the trunk build I have wondered about the stability of the new iwinfo based wireless-stats tab in luci-statistics. The recent builds have been occasionally crashing if that graph is enabled. But when the iwinfo section is disabled in luci-statistics, the last build r29571-2011-12-19 has been quite stable. The reason of the crashes is not quite clear yet, but I am keeping the graph off for the time being, just in case.
