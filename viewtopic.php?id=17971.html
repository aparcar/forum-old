					<p>My router hates me.</p><p>I&#039;ve been trying to get Kamikaze 7.09 working for several days now with no success.&nbsp; My latest problem is that I can&#039;t write to /etc/config/dhcp because I get a segmentation fault.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure that&#039;s a bad thing.</p><p>This happens whether I use telnet in failsafe mode, or the WebIf interface in normal mode.&nbsp; When I SSH in, the dhcp and firewall config files have been deleted.&nbsp; It seems to happen when I try to update them from WebIf.&nbsp; If I try to go to the DHCP area in WebIf everything just hangs because there&#039;s no config file for it to read.</p><p>Earlier, I could restore them in failsafe mode from /rom/etc/config and get the router to respond again.&nbsp; Then the second time I tried to update DHCP (switched on Authoratative in WebIf) it gave me that seg fault while updating the config file.&nbsp; Then it stopped responding and I had to go to failsafe.&nbsp; But even in failsafe it won&#039;t let me copy that config back because it seg faults again.</p><p>Here&#039;s the old threads:</p><p>1 - <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=17895">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=17895</a></p><p>2 - <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=17930">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=17930</a></p><p>These issues had been mostly resolved (I think) except that DHCP wasn&#039;t working now.&nbsp; I had just started working on that problem when I ran into this seg fault issue.</p><p>Should I just reload the Linksys firmware and start all over?</p>									</div>
