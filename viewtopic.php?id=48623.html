Router 2: ISP Actiontec Router (192.168.1.1, DHCP on)</code></pre></div><br /><p>- Both routers are connected via their LAN ports to each other.</p><p>I only connect to Router 1 and would like everything that connects to Router 1 to go over the VPN (when I initialize it). </p><br /><p><strong>Things that are working:</strong><br />- I can connect to the internet without a problem from Router 1<br />- My OpenVPN connects correctly on my &quot;VPN_Interface&quot;<br />- Traceroute from the Diagnostics page shows the packet originating from my VPN IP address</p><p><strong>Things that aren&#039;t working:</strong><br />- My external IP address is that of my ISP (instead of the VPN, arghh)<br />- I only see a few kb of data going over VPN_Interface, while most of the data is going over the LAN interface.</p><br /><p>Any advice would be really appreciated <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> I&#039;m stumped.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>truncj</strong> on 24 Jan 2014, 17:21)</p>

					<p>I guess you need to route traffic from your lan to openvpn tunnel. The easeiest way is to add&nbsp; &quot;redirect-gateway def1&quot; option to your openvpn config. See more <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/vpn.howto"> in wiki</a></p>									</div>

I had read that maybe I need to change the config to dev &#039;tap0&#039; instead of &#039;tun0&#039;, since the OpenWRT router isn&#039;t actually doing any routing (more of an ethernet switch). Does that make sense?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>truncj</strong> on 24 Jan 2014, 21:27)</p>
