					<p>Not sure what it means but here is what&#039;s going on.</p><p>I have transmission on the router and I requested one of the ports to be open, actually 2 of them One for transmission another one for uTorrent on computer. So I did opened them as I learned previously. And according to canyouseeme.org both ports are open. But here is my question. transmission is always crying about closed port. Even now I am doing -pt and it&#039;s saying no.</p><p>root@WRT1900AC:~# transmission-remote -pt<br />Port is open: No</p><br /><p>Any Thoughts ?</p><p>One thing , when opening port on the router. IT&#039;s both ways right ? I mean once port is open it&#039;s open to receive and send signals right ? Because I am thinking may be I did open ports for all incoming traffic but not to send out signal.</p>									</div>

					<p>This is weird. <a href="http://ismyportopen.com/">http://ismyportopen.com/</a> lists my port 51423 as open. Transmission listens on that port, I have it configured exactly as you say. Netstat says it listens on that port. Any idea what might be going on or how I could debug it further? Transmission on my computer works, I have set up port forwarding to it and is says the port is open, so the problem is only with the instance on the router.</p>									</div>
