					<p>Hi,<br />I&#039;m having a few issues filtering the multicast traffic that is breaking my wireless network. I have a Buffalo WBR-G54 which is acting as a wireless access point and as a WDS to an apple access point which has some wired stuff hanging off it. Whenever I stream multicast to the network from vlc the wireless just falls down.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried some of the rate limiting with &#039;wl mrate&#039; to no effect. I&#039;ve tried various iptables rules including these:</p><p>iptables -A INPUT&nbsp; &nbsp;-d 239.239.239.239 -i br0 -j DROP<br />iptables -A FORWARD -d 239.239.239.239 -i br0 -j DROP<br />iptables -A OUTPUT&nbsp; -d 239.239.239.239 -o br0 -j DROP</p><p>(the same as above again on both eth0 (lan) and eth2 (wlan)</p><p>iptables -A INPUT&nbsp; &nbsp;-m physdev --physdev-in eth0 -d 239.239.239.239 -j DROP<br />iptables -A FORWARD -m physdev --physdev-in eth0 --physdev-out eth2 -d 239.239.239.239&nbsp; -j DROP<br />iptables -A OUTPUT&nbsp; -m physdev --physdev-out eth2 -d 239.239.239.239 -j DROP</p><p>(and again as above specifying the interface br0).</p><p>I&#039;ve tried..</p><p>ifconfig -mutlicast &lt;interface&gt; up</p><p>..again to no effect. tcpdump still shows the data flowing through both eth0 and eth2. I&#039;m assuming that bridge-nf is patched into the 2.4.30 kernel? Other suggestions are greatly welcomed on how I can stop multicast breaking stuff.</p><p>If I routed the interfaces rather than bridging, I&#039;m guessing this might work, but I&#039;d prefer to avoid that if at all possible.</p><p>cheers,</p><p>john</p>									</div>

Within a LAN multicast basically equals broadcast. With some Ethernet hardware, individual stations can be stopped from receiving multicast traffic by doing the &quot;ifconfig -multicast&quot; thing. It won&#039;t stop it from being present on the LAN (and thus bridge) itself.</p><p>You can&#039;t disable multicast on the physical interfaces of br0 (because for br0 to function these interfaces are put in promicuous mode, which overrides any MULTICAST settings).</p><p>The only way to filter this is on Ethernet MAC level. You&#039;d have to filter out the MAC destination address of these packets. I think this can be done with the ebtables / kmod-ebtables packages.</p><br /><p>Good luck!</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, I started down the routing path, then realised that maybe I had been stupid with iptables so I reverted back to how it was before. I had tried to filter mutlicast with the pkttype module for iptables using these rules:</p><p>iptables -A INPUT&nbsp; &nbsp;-m pkttype --pkt-type multicast -j DROP<br />iptables -A FORWARD -m pkttype --pkt-type multicast -j DROP<br />iptables -A OUTPUT&nbsp; -m pkttype --pkt-type multicast -j DROP</p><p>but they didn&#039;t work. Reason was because I was stupid and I hadn&#039;t insmod&#039;d the ebtables and ebt_pkttype modules.</p><br /><p>So anyone else trying to filter out multicast (to stop it killing your wireless lan), make sure you install these kernel modules:</p><p>insmod ebtables ebt_pkttype ipt_pkttype</p><p>and use the iptables rules above.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, I tried the rules ep1p posted but the multicast traffic seems to get through as my wlan is punched out and my di-604 gets alot of traffic when plugging the cable in a lan port.</p><p>I tried to use ebtables directly but it says:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>root@slash:~# ebtables -L<br />The kernel doesn&#039;t support the ebtables &#039;filter&#039; table.</p></blockquote></div><p>I know the ips the traffic are coming from (239.16.16.x) so maybe theres a way to block that, but I want it to get through to some hosts.</p><p>Another thought is that only the control traffic is registered by &quot;multicast&quot; and the streaming data is something else?</p><p>And lastly, is there any package that comes with multicast tracking? Is igmpproxy useful?</p><p>edit.</p><p>insmod ebtable_filter was too obvious <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>thomasa88</strong> on 14 Apr 2007, 12:12)</p>

					<p>Incidentally, the rules I was using appeared to fail on me and I couldn&#039;t work out why or how to fix it. Tried reflashing the thing and setting it up from scratch and I couldn&#039;t get it work again. My linksys AP is now sitting on the window sill gathering dust and I&#039;m considering buying a 24 port switch that does IGMP filtering, and in the mean time, using either wireless or multicast.</p><p>john</p>									</div>
