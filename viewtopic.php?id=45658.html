					<p>My provider uses ip dhcp source guard feature. This means that ip traffic from client is blocked untill client gets ip address via dhcp. At start point there is no problem but if I plug out ethernet cabble from router and then plug in it back then router does not get ip address from dhcp and tries to use old one received at first time. I get blocked traffic ...</p><p>Usual PC with linux and dhcpcd has anothe behavior: after link is lost dhcpcd removes ip address and all dhcp parametrs from interface. After link is back dhcpcd tries to get new ip and parameters via dhcp again.</p><p>My provider is unstable (there is packet lost, link lost and other problems). Also I&#039;m not very shure that problem is in dhcp (this is remote router and I can not stay near it long time to solve the problem).</p><p>Is it possible to get tha same behavior udhcpc like dhcpcd does in PC ? </p><p>May be some script in /etc/hotplug.d/ ? But I don&#039;t&#039; understand how to write this scripts. May be there is example ?</p>									</div>
