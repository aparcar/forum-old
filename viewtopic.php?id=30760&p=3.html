					<p>I really would appriciate a final walkthrough for adblocking with openwrt on routerlevel. Is the script of LinuxNewb working with AA?</p><p>Edit:<br />Here is what I did and this is working instantly.<br />I downloaded <a href="http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.zip,">http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.zip,</a> extracted it and copied the file to /etc/hosts (overwrote it).<br />Now when I start my router it instantly loads the hosts file.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stonecarver</strong> on 3 Dec 2012, 14:17)</p>
