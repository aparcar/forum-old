					<p>Just installed OpenWrt on a WRT54G and it appears to be working OK.</p><p>However, my main goal is getting NoCat gateway working, and something seems amiss.<br />Only packages Ive added are nocatsplash and nas.<br />The initial splash screen comes up with the login button.<br />But after that is clicked, nothing happens.(but it apparently logged in at that point)<br />Its supposed to kick you to the redirect home page.<br />If I click login again, it then goes to my original browser home page.</p><p>Am I missing a config somewhere or another package?</p><p>I&#039;ve uzed ZoneCD before, and that seems to work for splash and redirect.<br />This is my first time with OpenWrt.</p><p>Thanks for any help<br />jondo</p>									</div>
