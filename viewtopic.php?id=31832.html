					<p>First of all there is a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-violation.html">page</a> that describes the process for identifying and reporting GPL violations. Only OpenWRT contributors that have SVN commit rights can ask MiOS to comply. Technically any BusyBox, Samba, Lua contributors can also act as plaintiffs. I do not think that you as a their software user would have any voice in that discussion. </p><p>Also Mi Casa Verde, which seems to be the company behind MiOS is also very proud of their openness on this <a href="http://wiki.micasaverde.com/index.php/Luup_Press_Release#Cross_platform_for_OEM_use">page</a>. </p><p>In fact, I just checked with dnstree, and micasaverde.com and mios.com are hosted on the same IP address (96.44.128.235.static.quadranet.com). So they are in essence the same company.</p>									</div>

					<p>It looks like they are running an unmodified version of OpenWrt as the base of their system. As long as they don&#039;t modify any GPL parts they should be fine.

					<p>This is a serious point of confusion.</p><p>The GPL =can= reach out and contaminate other software, but it doesn&#039;t automatically contaminate everything running on whatever machine the GPL software happens to be running on.</p><p>Most commercial developers are aware of the viral nature of the GPL, and have been for 10 or 20 years (depending on how old they are ...) and usually take all the required steps to insure there is no contamination of their product because of the GPL&#039;s viral nature.&nbsp; As an aside, many free software developers (I&#039;m one -- this system is almost certainly running software I wrote) are aware of the way that the GPL stifles software development, because of fear of viral infection, and don&#039;t release software under the GPL or the LGPL.&nbsp; In my case, I had software stolen by developers and redistributed under the LGPL, with all of my copyright and license statements removed.&nbsp; I could care less, but as has been noted by others, it happens.&nbsp; There have been GPL enforcement lawsuit over code I wrote and I wasn&#039;t named as a party, even though my properly-attributed code was part of what was misappropriated.</p><p>One of the reasons for the LGPL is because the &quot;linking&quot; problem with the GPL meant it was very unlikely any commercial vendors would use anything with a GPL license.&nbsp; Stallman can scream bloody hell that people aren&#039;t happy about his virus, but some of us have bills to pay and don&#039;t get subsidized by others.</p><p>Another point is that even IF a library is under the GPL, if the library isn&#039;t required, the viral infection doesn&#039;t happen -- in other words, if there is a GPL&#039;d library, and a non-GPL&#039;d library, and the interface isn&#039;t unique to the GPL&#039;d version, the linkage doesn&#039;t create a derived work.&nbsp; Something from a GPL&#039;d &quot;work&quot; has to be included for their to be any sort of derived work involved.</p><p>So people need to be careful before tossing around accusations that the GPL has been violated because some people who don&#039;t support the GPL are in a position to sue product distributors who&#039;ve benefited from our work and sued for damages when others have violated =their= rights.</p><p>THAT said, I also support free and open software, I just don&#039;t believe the GPL is the correct vehicle because it does create this vigilante mentality.&nbsp; I&#039;ve contributed free software to the free software using community for something like 27 or 28 years.&nbsp; I&#039;ve contributed to products that are licensed under the GPL and LGPL, and I make very =careful= use of GPL&#039;d and LGPL&#039;d products.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think part of the mess here is that MIOS has what appear to be confusing statements about GPL, OpenWRT, etc on several of their wiki pages (probably related to older versions).</p><p>Here (<a href="http://wiki.micasaverde.com/index.php/License">http://wiki.micasaverde.com/index.php/License</a>) they mention that all GPL/LGPL changes they make are published appropriately. Where or do they make none? Seems like it should be easy enough to clarify this. Look how nicely Netgear does it (and of course they don&#039;t have to include anything proprietary - just the GPL/LGPL stuff): <a href="http://support.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2649/~/gpl-open-source-code-for-programmers">http://support.netgear.com/app/answers/ … rogrammers</a>.</p><p>Here (<a href="http://wiki.micasaverde.com/index.php/Source_Code">http://wiki.micasaverde.com/index.php/Source_Code</a>) they again talk about source code for OpenWRT and some of their stuff being open. But I believe the versions mentioned are very outdated.</p><p>Cleaning up outdated references plus a clear statement on use and modification (or lack of modification) of GPL/LGPL stuff would be great IMO. Something as simple as &quot;MIOS version XXX is based on unmodified OpenWRT XYZ source&quot; if that&#039;s the case (updated for recent MIOS releases). Or an appropriate link to the updated source if they are in fact modifying OpenWRT build tree in any way.</p><p>Same for MIOS own code. Either remove all references to it being open source or update links so that souce code for parts that are open are available.</p><p>As a potential (quite likely in fact with the new Vera 3 hardware announcements) MIOS customer I&#039;m not expecting the release proprietary stuff; but I would like more information on the actual openness of the underlying firmware they&#039;re building on top of (can I still extend the underlying OpenWRT functionality - warranty off the table of course - while leaving their layer running on top?).</p><p>MIOS - it is understandable for you to jump in here (with one post) to challenge suggestions of GPL violations. Will you be as quick to provide clarity for tech-savvy customers who want to understand the relationship between MIOS and OpenWRT while still respecting the legitimately closed nature of parts of your offering?</p><p>-Jeff</p>									</div>
