					<p>I&#039;m not sure I understand what you want to achieve. Can you explain in more detail?</p><p>The standard OpenWRT build process yields in a set of image files, and this set depends entirely on the selected target and subtarget. Some target/subtarget combinations will yield a U-boot image that can be written to the non-volatile memory chip, and some might yield an additional U-boot image that can be downloaded directly to the volative RAM memory of the device. Other combinations may not produce U-boot images at all, if the kernel &amp; rootfs images intended for that target are directly compatible with the existing U-boot present on the device.</p>									</div>
