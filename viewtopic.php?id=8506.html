					<p>As suggested in this old thread <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=1327">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=1327</a>, I wonder if anyone has had any success writing a hostapd driver for the WRT54G, since hostapd offers much better encryption versatility with WPA than nas does... If this driver exist, can someone point me in the right direction? How to implement it etc...</p><p>If I&#039;m far behind, and this driver has existed for a long time, and is stable too, shouldn&#039;t it be made default instead of nas? Or, if it is nonexistent, should we put some effort in getting hostapd working on broadcom?</p><p>Another reason why I&#039;m asking this is because of this thread: <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=7657">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=7657</a><br />I have yet to manage to get nas working together with Windows clients, and i hoped I could try hostapd instead...</p>									</div>
