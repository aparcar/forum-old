					<p>We are a software company looking to talk to an OpenWrt developer that could help us to create a custom build that would help us to create our product offering.</p><p>We are looking to use a low cost ethernet bridge (L2 only - not done with routing) on a customer site and to have that device act to forward all HTTP/s traffic to a proxy server on the Internet .</p><p>We would use a box like the Netgear WGR614L and it would be placed into an existing small business customer site between their switch and router - and would re-direct all web traffic to our external proxy server.&nbsp; As above , we need to do this at L2 so that there is no impact on the customer&#039;s LAN.</p><p>We pay good $ (pay by Paypal, wire transfer, Western Union etc) and are looking for a developer who could help us to create this interesting implementation.</p><p>If you are interested in finding our more just drop us a line at jobs@avendi.com.au or message me on this forum.</p>									</div>
