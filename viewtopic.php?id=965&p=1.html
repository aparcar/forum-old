					<p>Hello,</p><p>i just bought an Siemens SE505 and want to try OpenWRT.<br />After tftp&#039;ing the latest snapshot to the SE505<br />it enters a loop. I think it is constantly rebooting.<br />A ping is possible for 5 secs, then LEDs flicker and ping hangs for some seconds. </p><p>What can i try. The unit is working fine with the original firmware. OpenWRT would be much cooler and powerful.</p><p>What could i try?</p><p>&nbsp; Ciao<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dietmar</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, well I got the same on my unit. Which is a relativly new one with a BCM4712 running at 200MHz an not like in the OpenWRT documentation points out a 125MHz CPU based board.</p><p>Reflashing the original firmware by Siemens via TFTP fixes the problem of rebooting in a loop and prevents the one from starting a carrer as a brick but OpenWRT is not supposed to run on SE505 anymore.</p><p>Would be interesting in getting access to the serial console of the board to watch and analyse the boot messages....</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas?<br />Regards</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;d be glad to try. How can I uncomment/modify this in the preinit script. I&#039;ve just got a .trx image. Does this mean I have to install and get a complete build environment running in order to modify or is there another way to get access to files in the trx image?</p><p>Thanks for any advice!</p>									</div>

					<p>Okay I will send a dump of the NVRAM as soon as I can, but might take some time...
