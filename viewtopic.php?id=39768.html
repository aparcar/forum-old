					<p>Hi,</p><p>In /etc/config/networks, I have some interfaces defined with auto=0. The desired behavior is that these interfaces shouldn&#039;t come up at boot time (or through /etc/init.d/network restart or ifup -a), but they should come up on demand when explicitly specified in the ifup command.</p><p>This doesn&#039;t seem to be working though; &quot;ifup foo&quot; won&#039;t bring up interface foo when the interface&#039;s auto field is set to 0. As a workaround, one can use &quot;uci set network.foo.auto=1; ifup foo; uci revert network.foo.auto&quot;.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure what would be a preferred fix; should ifup itself change the uci auto settings to make this work, or should netifd ignore the auto setting when reacting to an explicit user request through the ifup command ?</p><p>(If it makes any difference, the above is observed when running with the 12.09-beta snapshot on a wndr3800)</p>									</div>
