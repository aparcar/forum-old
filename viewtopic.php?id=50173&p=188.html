					<p>Just joined to forum to thank everyone who has been working on this openwrt for the 1900AC!<br />Yesterday i installed the official CC snapshot (r45557), installed luci and samba, everything went smoothly. However, i use a USB3 drive and is experiencing slow file transfers (~30-50 MBit/s) when going from lan-&gt;usb but wireless-&gt;usb seems to be quicker.<br />Also the package luci-app-statistics doesn&#039;t seem to receive any data.<br />Keep up the good work!</p>									</div>

					<p>The easiest way to actually see if it&#039;s up or not is take another computer and check if it can see the AP or install an app on your phone that displays the whole frequency spectrum.</p><p>Examples are for Android:<br /><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.android.wifiscanner">https://play.google.com/store/apps/deta … ifiscanner</a> (Wifi Overview 360)<br /><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farproc.wifi.analyzer">https://play.google.com/store/apps/deta … i.analyzer</a> (Wifi Analyzer)</p><p>I am not affiliated with them in any way.</p><p>The second one is easier to use and looks better in my opinion where the first is better at actually displaying the whole spectrum. Sometimes the second one refuses to show channels on 5GHz that are above 48 which is sad as I run my WRT1900AC at channel 108 using 80MHz and DFS. (With a DFS-patch obviously).</p><p>EDIT: Note that if you run the same SSID on both and check from a computer, most default tools won&#039;t show which band it&#039;s on, taht&#039;s why I just take my cellphone out when I want to check frequencies.</p><p>The bonus is that those apps will show you where there are good holes for you to run your wireless on.</p><p>// Stefan</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stesmi</strong> on 23 Apr 2015, 20:58)</p>
