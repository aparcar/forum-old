					<p>I wish to create an off-site backup for my critical files and I&#039;m looking for suggestions.&nbsp; </p><p>I&#039;ve read a few posts (<a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=50682">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=50682</a>) about this topic but am not aware of what backup programs/methods are available for OpenWRT.&nbsp; What options are there?</p><p>I already have two WRTSL54GS units, one of which is working well as an OpenVPN server and router for my LAN, the other of which will be off-site with a 320 GB hard drive attached to it.&nbsp; I wish for the remote WRTSL54GS to open a VPN connection to my LAN and grab a prepared/compressed differential backup file from a Windows XP file server and a Linux webserver.</p><p>At the end of the week, I want another nightly &quot;differential&quot; backup to occur but this time, I want all of the differential backups from the week to be combined, in sequential order, with whatever &quot;full-backup&quot; copy is in the drive, thus creating a new &quot;full-backup&quot; of the file server.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t decided how I want files to be deleted off of the off-site backup drive (yet) although I think I will have them be moved to a &quot;deleted files&quot; directory and stored there until I manually delete them or a specified period of time has passed (like a month or something).</p><p>Finally, I&#039;m not sure if leaving the remote hard drive running all of the time is required.&nbsp; Is there any way to put a disk to sleep and then wake it up when needed (I&#039;ve read about this too and seem to think the answer is &quot;no,&quot; but perhaps someone knows better)?</p><p>Some of these tasks could be easily accomplished by CRON, wget, and SAMBA (client) but I&#039;m sure someone has some good ideas on how I could do this.&nbsp; Any input would be greatly appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>Wodin,</p><p>You are correct.&nbsp; I wish to apply the &quot;differential&quot; backups, in sequence, to an existing &quot;full backup&quot; to create a new full backup.&nbsp; It is clear that RAM will be a problem with using rsync, however after the first synchronization there shouldn&#039;t be too many changes (i.e. maybe 100 files per day, not thousands of files).&nbsp; Perhaps I should order an additional RAM chip and add it to the router, give it 64 MB of RAM, before I place it in it&#039;s new home.</p><p>Why wouldn&#039;t swapping to disk be a good idea?&nbsp; Hard drives can handle it although the swap process would be slower.&nbsp; I guess if the disk were offline or somehow disabled, there would be some problems.&nbsp; Can the swap space be dynamically moved without rebooting?&nbsp; Perhaps, if that were possible, I could move the swap space over to the drive during the backup, and then move it back to RAM after the backup is completed. </p><p>Let me know if you have any other ideas.&nbsp; These are good suggestions thus far.</p>									</div>

					<p>It looks like someone has already posted something similar to what I need to the wiki:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/rsync-usb-sambaHowTo">http://wiki.openwrt.org/rsync-usb-sambaHowTo</a>, although it appears that they have the client rsync to the backup device.&nbsp; Of course, I would like to do it the other way around (have the backup device initiate the sync, grab the files, and store them locally).&nbsp; So, there are a few more good ideas, such as emailing the results of the sync.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bkloppenborg</strong> on 3 Feb 2008, 20:26)</p>
