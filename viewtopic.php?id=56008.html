     (for ip in $(zcat blacklist.txt.gz|sed -n &#039;/^[0-9]/p&#039;); do ipset -q add blacklist $ip -exist; done);
  else

I also think you did not read what I wrote at all otherwise you would see that I said two things:</p><p>1. You will not find this script ready made (someone needs to make it whether it is you or someone else)<br />2. If you don&#039;t specify what you&#039;re looking for then no one is going to make it the way you want (why don&#039;t you start outlining how you think this should work with specifics about the logic...)</p><p>I just don&#039;t see this as being a one-size-fits all script for everyones&#039; needs although a foundation can be created which could be easily modified to meet different requirements.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>arfett</strong> on 2 Mar 2015, 19:14)</p>
