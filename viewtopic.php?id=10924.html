					<p>It seems that most of these routers support a full or partial PCI bus. Some of them even have miniPCI slots which break out all the PCI pins in a way that can &quot;easily&quot; be tapped into. <br />Are there any devices which could break out the PCI slot into multiple slots?<br />Could I just solder another slot on top of the existing one with the same pinout?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Adam</p>									</div>

					<p>No, they each have to be individually selectable by the PCI controller.&nbsp; There are mini-pci breakout boards, but they are difficult to find and I have no idea if the chips they use (they have to be active - they make the card look like a complete sub-pci bus) are properly supported by Linux.&nbsp; </p><p>There are boards supported by OpenWrt&nbsp; with multiple (mini)-PCI slots.&nbsp; Using the x86 target you could try mini-ITX boards and the Soekris boards, and then moving to other architectures the Routerboard 532 supports two mini-PCI cards, as does the 112 and the 153 and 133 both support 3 mini-PCI cards.&nbsp; But the support the the RB1xx series is still a bit experimental - there is at least one patch not (as far as I know) in svn yet which is needed for PCI support on the RB1xx series.</p>									</div>
