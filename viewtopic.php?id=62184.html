					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m used to flashing and building custom OpenWRT firmwares and I&#039;ve done it on many devices (even on unsupported devices). I know the TP-Link WDR4300 is a well supported router and it works fine if I use a prebuilt image. However, if I create my own image, it just won&#039;t boot. I have to use the recovery TFTP to flash another image. I use the following settings:</p><p>Target system: Atheros AR7xxx/AR9xxx<br />Subtarget: Generic<br />Target profile: TP-LINK TL-WDR3500/3600/4300/4310/MW4350R</p><p>The custom image is the same size as the prebuilt one. Is there a specific setting I need to turn on to make it work? Of course, I could open the case and use the RS232 port and check the output, but if someone already knows the answer, it would save me some time.</p><p>Thanks <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Edit: I use Chaos Calmer and hardware version 1.7</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mattwylde</strong> on 16 Jan 2016, 19:12)</p>

					<p>I&#039;ve had no issues with mine (v1.6), and I upgrade it all the time (I&#039;m on trunk). Have you checked that it doesn&#039;t respond to anything (ping, SSH, telnet, HTTP, HTTPS)? Also, when installing your image, are you using the -factory or -sysupgrade image? From OpenWrt to OpenWrt, use sysupgrade. From stock TP-Link to OpenWrt, use -factory. Try not preserving configuration on a sysupgrade.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK Thanks. I will checkout a fresh tree and retry.</p><p>The router does not respond to anything. In fact, no LED light up (except for power). I have to use recovery mode from the boot loader using the WPS button to unbrick. If the new build doesn&#039;t work, I check with the serial console.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, it turns out my tree must have gotten corrupt. I checked out a fresh source tree and it worked on the first try. I also noticed that it only built the images for the WDR4300 and its siblings (my old tree built all AR7xxx devices even though I had the same .config).</p><p>Thanks for your help, I didn&#039;t have to open the device.</p>									</div>
