					<p>First thing I would try to fix is figuring out why the OpenWrt device is not responding to requests to the 192.168.1.1 address; default configuration should work exactly like that. How did you configure that device? Can you post your config files here, please?</p>									</div>

					<p>Wow, sorry for the lack of reply. </p><p>So, right now I have fully reset the device back to default. I connect it via cat5 cable to my Comcast router/modem.

					<p>It&#039;s probably worth noting what firmware you are running.&nbsp; IIRC, the original wingspinner bins had relayd configured and were not exactly OpenWrt stock configs.</p>									</div>
