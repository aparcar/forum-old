					<p>Hi !</p><p>I own a WRT54GS V1. I have done the serial mod and the mmc mod. Not at the same time of course.<br />Firstly i ve sone the serial mod with success, that means two RS232 serial ports one for null modem and one for other use (ISDN Modem).<br />Then I ve done the mmc mod in this way using these howtos <br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Customizing/Hardware/MMC">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Cus … rdware/MMC</a><br /><a href="http://kiel.kool.dk">http://kiel.kool.dk</a>/<br /><a href="http://www.uanr.com/sdfloppy/">http://www.uanr.com/sdfloppy/</a></p><p>1. checked were the right GPIO Pins on my router PCB.<br />2. soldered the wires.<br />3. double-checked if there are no short cuts especially on RP3.<br />After that the router booted fine.<br />4. Tested the mod by doing &#039;insmod mmc&#039; with plugged in SD-Card.<br />The output was expected, and the device files under /dev appeared.<br />fsck.ext2 worked fine, too.<br />Because till then every thing worked fine, a have not output from step 4.<br />5. After five to ten minutes the router PCB has made noises, the odyssey begins.<br />I located the the noise coming out of the Broadcom chip.<br />I unplugged the router from power and reconnected it without an SD-Card inserted.<br />Still noises from PCB and the Board was not booting up fully seen in the serial console.<br />I unplugged it again. And removed serial header, connected an usb serial, just for the case.<br />Still the same. Now I was desparete. I have un-done the soldering of wires on RP3, double checked again for shortcuts.<br />After powering no noises come from PCB and the machine booted up with no problems but with an strange config. Anyhow the NVRAM has been modified. The router was at 192.168.1.1, was announcing the default ESSID on Wlan port and thats the problem I was not able to ping the router via LAN. Associating to wlan was possible I could not ping the router neither after doing DHCP at the client (there was no DHCP response from router) nor by setting an IP manually.<br />Strangly the WLAN LED was flashing when sending pings from the router to the clients but not the LAN LEDs.<br />The same happens if entered CFE via serial console, connecting the PC to LAN Port, giving the router IP 192.168.1.1 and the PC 192.168.1.2. No ping from both sides got answered.</p><p>After I have goolged and reading a bit I found some forum posts in here and in the **-WRT Forum, from users experiencing similar things, not only after doing the mmc mod, but with the same problem that there is no way to reach the WRT again.</p><p>Some of them succeded by flashing a new CFE via JTAG. So I did the same, doing these steps:<br />Soldered JTAG Xilinx from here<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Customizing/Hardware/JTAG_Cable?highlight=%28JTAG%29">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Cus … %28JTAG%29</a><br />Firstly I made a backup of NVRAM to check if there is readable config text in it the check if cable is working.<br />The I backup the possible malicious CFE and made new CFE via <a href="http://www.wlan-skynet.de/docs/ortsverteilung/wrt54g/flash-cfe-erneuern.shtml">http://www.wlan-skynet.de/docs/ortsvert … uern.shtml</a>.<br />I then cleared kernel and nvram via the wrt54g utillity now I reflashed the new CFE like this one <br /><a href="http://www.wlan-skynet.de/docs/ortsverteilung/wrt54g/flash-datentransfer9.shtml">http://www.wlan-skynet.de/docs/ortsvert … fer9.shtml</a> and the HowTo-PDF in the HairyMaidDebrick archive file. wrt54g erased the flash and reflashed the CFE.BIN. It has said everything went okay.<br />(Sorry i have no output log :(.)</p><p>After the flash unplugged the WRT and repowered it. There was no message from CFE on the serial. :( I went to wrt54g util again an read out the CFE. Very much 00 in hex display. So I retried the flashing process of CFE without success.<br />No the wrt54g util hangs: (no I have output :)<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>abra@yggdrasil[~/src/build/jtag]$ sudo ./wrt54g -flash:cfe
