					<p>I installed 3.2.9 from trunk to my wrtsl54gs.&nbsp; I am using the wifi in client mode.</p><p>The wifi stays up a few hours, then quits working.&nbsp; When I reboot the AP it starts to work again for a few hours.&nbsp; I do not need to power cycle it; just a reboot command will do.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried rmmod insmod b43 but that doesn&#039;t fix the issue.</p><p>There are no errors, the system will associate with an AP but no data flows through.</p><p>Any suggestions on how to fix this?&nbsp; This worked fine with 2.6.xx.</p>									</div>
