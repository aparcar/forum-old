					<p>Have you noticed the OpenWrt logo has the motto: WIRELESS FREEDOM ? Perhaps if you have no use for wireless; you haven&#039;t fully realized the potential of your router.</p><p>I don&#039;t use any wireless but if I really wanted to remove it, I guess I&#039;d build it myself. But since I use the trunks; I don&#039;t complain about what&#039;s in them; I&#039;m actually thankful this $40 router works much better with OpenWrt than the factory firmware! </p><p>If you wanting to remove it for memory space, you may consider learning to build or configure without Luci. I found through testing many flashes with various packages installed that I really don&#039;t need a lot of flash memory, the more features and dynamics that I add, the more the connection speed will slow. Maybe that&#039;s why Tomato&#039;s motto is light and mean. So the trunk with Luci and a few small packages is fine for my small router.</p>									</div>

					<p>if you remove /etc/config/wireless the tabs should disappear.</p><p>Of course this also removes all wireless functionality from the router.</p>									</div>
