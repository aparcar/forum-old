					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;ve been using OpenWRT for a long while but this is my first post here (feels odd after reading so many posts on this forum).</p><p>I&#039;ve recently tried OpenWRT on my Buffalo WHR-HP-G54 (BCM5352 @ 200MHz, 16MB ram, 4MB nand) and all transfers are painfully slow ... both wired and wireless.</p><p>I&#039;m using the 2.6 kernel builds brcm47xx (which seem I have to, see last paragraph) and so far i have tried:</p><p>- backfire 10.03<br />- backfire 10.03.1-rc3<br />- compiled my own and very stripped down firmware from trunk</p><p>I have no real clue why it is this slow, I&#039;m getting below 1 MB/s on the wired connection between the router and a client PC and the wireless barely connects -- it hunts for several minutes before it can associate and then it is either virtually unusable or drops quikly. Putting wpa_supplicant in debug mode, I can see pauses that are about 3-5 *seconds* between two consecutive echoed lines.</p><p>In comparison, OpenWRT on both my Linksys WRT54GS (BCM4712 @ 200 MHz, 32 MB ram, 8 MB nand) and on my Mikrotik RB411 (300 MHz, AR7130, 64 MB ram, 32 MB nand) simply flies like most other firmwares ... no speed issues there at all. Also, there are no speed issues when using DD-WRT or Tomato USB K26 NEWD (which also uses the 2.6 kernel) on the Buffalo WHR-HP-G54.</p><p>I doubt that the slowness on the WHR-HP-G54 is caused by the reduced ram and nand size since there is almost always a few good MB free of ram and around 1.5 MB free space when using my own compiled OpenWRT. Also, /proc/cpuload or top do not indicate any real activity either.</p><p>The problem (so to speak) is that I *have to* use the brcm47xx OpenWRT release since it is the only firmware I know that allows me to use the wifi in client mode with WPA2-EAP with PEAP+MS-CHAPv2 authentication (802.1x Radius client) ... it&#039;s not supported in the brcm-2.4 releases. Theoretically, any 3rd party firmware using the 2.6 kernel and a newer broadcom driver should be able to do it by using wpa_supplicant but nobody else other than the OpenWRT team seems to care (not even Mikrotik with their ridiculously priced RouterOS, sorry for the rant) ...</p><p>Anyone has a clue of what I could do to fix this slowness of the OpenWRT + WHR-HP-G54 tandem?</p><p>Cheers</p><p>p.s. I did search for similar issues but didn&#039;t find any solutions.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mastabog</strong> on 18 Nov 2010, 03:42)</p>

					<p>I do have the same problem with an Asus WRT 500gp:<br />Slow speed...</p><p>The problem must be somewhere in the pppoe client.</p><p>Try connecting your router behind another router (I use a sipura 2100)<br />and use dhcp in spite of &#039;pppoe&#039; in the network config file.<br />Give the openwrt wouter a DMZ in the first router and<br />you should be fine.</p><p>Then you get full speed again on openwrt. I know that<br />this is not exactly what you want, but it works around<br />the problem.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the reply, mik30.</p><p>Unfortunately, i&#039;m not connecting using PPPoE at all (actually, pppoe is not even running, nor are any ppp modules inserted). I stripped down the firmware to 1.6 MB removing everything I don&#039;t need.</p><p>The Bufallo is a wireless routed client: I connect using wifi to an Eduroam network of the university and do a simple NAT on the LAN (ip_forward=1 in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward and a single iptables rule in the NAT table to do MASQUERADE) as I have multiple PCs.</p><p>I could try bridging the wan (wifi in my case) and lan interfaces but then I can&#039;t have more than one PC. AFAIK, the Eduroam AP issues only one IP per connection, but I haven&#039;t actually tried this. </p><p>A single iptables masquerade rule should not slow everything down ... especially since the K26 NEWD Tomato USB firmware (also based on the 2.6 kernel) is lightning fast.</p><p>When it was going slow for you, were you noticing the cpuload going up in /proc/cpuload?</p><p>Cheers</p>									</div>

					<p>Same problem here.<br />LAN Speed is stuck around ~500KBps on my asus wl500gp, sometimes ~200KBps !<br />I apparently have no qos, and I also removed iptables rules without improvements.<br />Throughput is also terrible between wireless and LAN ports.<br />I remember that some weeks ago I used to copy files at full 802.11g (4,1MBps).

					<p>@goo: That&#039;s what I see as well. In short, everything is slow ... do you happen to remember around when (month/date?) did it work well for you? </p><p>We could try and update to an svn revision prior to that and see if it works. If yes, then somebody may be able to figure out the slowness reason by looking at the diffs (although they&#039;d be quite many since then).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mastabog</strong> on 24 Nov 2010, 01:40)</p>

					<p>Well, after taking a quick look to my image backups it seems that I was running the stock 10.03.1-rc3 (r20728) built from ImageBuilder. I wish I had started to build from trunk earlier.<br />Anyway I&#039;ll try some subsequent revisions on a spare wl500gp, maybe tomorrow if I&#039;ll have the time.<br />--<br />ciao,<br />goo</p>									</div>
