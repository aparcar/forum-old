					<p>I have a TP-Link WR741ND v2.4 . I&#039;d like to share its serial port on my local network as a raw TCP or UDP (TCP would be better). I soldered a cable onto the pins as shown <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr741nd#serial">here</a>. But I don&#039;t know if I need to use pull-up or pull-down resistors and how to share this port.</p>									</div>

					<p>There are several locations, where the serial port is bound to console:<br />1. in /etc/inittab there is a line which enables login to serial console. you need to comment out/delete it: &quot;ttyS0::askfirst:/bin/ash --login&quot;<br />2. while building a firmware image, you can edit the kernel command line, which normally contains something like &quot;console=ttyS0,115200&quot;, change or delete this<br />3. your bootloader also contains a kernel command line. But I&#039;m not sure, if it gets overridden by the one within the firmware image.</p>									</div>
