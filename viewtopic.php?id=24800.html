					<p>Hi<br />I tried to upgrade my backfire through LUCI and ended up with a dysfunctional router - I think I tried to flash squashfs over jffs but thats not the problem - I could go in and reflash the router using tftp but I need to find the routers MAC address to manually set the route using arp - this is the page I am getting my instructions from:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/buffalo/wzr-hp-g300h">http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/buffalo/wzr-hp-g300h</a><br />Unfortunatly I had not anticipated needing to reflash so I don&#039;t have a note of the routers MAC, I&#039;ve already checked the router housing and the board - does anyone have any other ideas? I think I might need to make a JTAG cable and do some reading but I thought I would ask as a last resort.<br />Thanks</p>									</div>
