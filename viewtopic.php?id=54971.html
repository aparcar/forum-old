					<p>Hi everybody,</p><p>I&#039;m kinda new there, even if I had heard of OpenWRT for a while. I recently bought an <a href="http://www.tp-link.com/en/products/details/?model=Archer+C9">Archer C9</a> and I was interested in flashing OpenWRT on it. However I found it it wasn&#039;t supported yet (listed in <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/unknown?&amp;#tp-link">unknown status</a>). It seems like the Broadcom platform may prevent it for being fully OpenWRT-ready, right ?</p><p>I already saw <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=54802">this topic</a>, I tried looking at the doc for a long time but honestly this is far beyond my poor programming skills...I could maybe learn it with time but I currently don&#039;t have much time and it&#039;s not likely to improve in the next 6 months.</p><p>So I did what I could do : opening my Archer C9 and taking pictures of things inside. I couldn&#039;t go through metallic parts under the heatsink but I documented everything I could document. Some components have something written on them but it&#039;s too small to see that in pictures : I numbered them on the pictures and I wrote back those writings under those.</p><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/Oj5epkO.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/Oj5epkO.jpg</a><br /><a href="http://i.imgur.com/3CnFCAv.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/3CnFCAv.jpg</a><br /><a href="http://i.imgur.com/0DmzpVi.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/0DmzpVi.jpg</a><br /><a href="http://i.imgur.com/1s3MbFQ.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/1s3MbFQ.jpg</a><br /><a href="http://i.imgur.com/ZGHkEmm.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/ZGHkEmm.jpg</a></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>(1) :

					<p>Nah, somebody managed to have a serial access to the router, hence the boot log. Then this guy flashed OpenWRT on the router and published a bootlog. The firmware which was flashed was for another router, it was purely for developing purposes (providing an OpenWRT bootlog).</p><p>Btw I have no idea how he could flash such a TRX image on this router (I have serial access too)...</p><p>I&#039;ve revamped the router&#039;s wiki page and you can see I wrote &quot;<strong>Status : unknown</strong>&quot;, which can mean a lot of things except it is currently supported. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p><span class="bbu">TL;DR:</span> Router not supported atm. Full support is very unlikely because of closed source Broadcom stuff. The logs you can see on the wiki are purely for developing purposes.</p><p><em>Concerning my own case I might even sell the 2 routers I own and switch to something else whithout some obscure bunch of closed software. &#039;should have fully checked the wiki before buying it, I thought it would be the same than Archer C7</em></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Fullerene</strong> on 2 Jun 2015, 19:58)</p>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I also got this router and I&#039;m really interested in installing OpenWrt on it. It looks like DD-WRT is using the proprietary Broadcom drivers, as it does the stock firmware. We will probably see full support by OpenWrt only when the BCM4360 will be supported in the open source driver (b43). Until then, is there a way in OpenWrt to install the proprietary broadcom drivers?</p>									</div>
