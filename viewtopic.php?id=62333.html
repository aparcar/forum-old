					<p>Hello,</p><p>what happened to the digitemp package, it is missing in chaos calmer and trunk. <br />the digitemp project is still active, so i am wondering why openwrt drops the package ?</p><p>digitemp github: <a href="https://github.com/bcl/digitemp">https://github.com/bcl/digitemp</a></p><p>Would be a loss, if the package is really dropped, as owfs is buggy as hell <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Well, digitemp seems to be in the &quot;oldpackages&quot; repository:<br /><a href="http://git.openwrt.org/?p=packages.git;a=summary">http://git.openwrt.org/?p=packages.git;a=summary</a><br />Package: <a href="http://git.openwrt.org/?p=packages.git;a=blob;f=utils/digitemp/Makefile;h=2381581fe17fe87cdefb2a686bc9be0d2b48ffc5;hb=HEAD">http://git.openwrt.org/?p=packages.git; â€¦ c5;hb=HEAD</a></p><p>That repository contains all packages that have no active maintainer and are thus abandoned.</p><p>There was a big package cleanup two years ago: currently all packages need a maintainer who keeps the package updated. Packages that nobody has been interested enough, have been left on the oldpackages repo. But those packages are not compiled for releases (like CC15.05) or for trunk snapshots.</p><p>If you want the package brought to the DD trunk, pledge yourself as the new maintainer and create an up-to-date pull request at the new Github packages repo. <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/packages/pulls">https://github.com/openwrt/packages/pulls</a></p><p>Alternatively, activate the oldpackage feed in your build system and build the package for yourself. (however, as the package has not received any fixes for two years, it might not compile in the current trunk.)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 16 Feb 2016, 19:26)</p>
