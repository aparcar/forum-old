					<p>ok another weird thing..I&#039;ve always used dns based ad block for which dnsmasq read a hosts file from the mounted usb drive.</p><p>Today, i dont know if it has something to do with new build (r45250) or what, but dnsmasq is unable to read the file. <br />The file permissions are ok. Owner is root. i&#039;ve even given it 777 permission. Still doesnt work. However if i put the file on e.g /etc. Then it is read fine</p><p>Fri Apr&nbsp; 3 23:15:53 2015 daemon.err dnsmasq[6943]: failed to load names from /mnt/sda1/scripts/hosts.block: Permission denied</p><p>USB is ext4, mounted as RW. i can read the host file fine via ssh.&nbsp; I deleted and recreated the hosts file but no luck.</p><p>Any clues?</p><p>EDIT: I think i found perhaps why. Looks like the dnsmasq process is not running as root for some reason. This is what i see in &quot;ps&quot;</p><p>6994 nobody&nbsp; &nbsp; 1852 S&nbsp; &nbsp; /usr/sbin/dnsmasq -C /var/etc/dnsmasq.conf -k -x /var/run/dnsmasq/dnsmasq.pid</p><br /><p>EDIT 2:&nbsp; Apparently DNSMASQ in general downgrades itself to nobody from root after starting up as root. So the question is if that behavor is normal then why the permission error? a few builds back this was working fine and i never had any problem.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>alirz</strong> on 6 Apr 2015, 00:28)</p>

					<p>I know MCWRT is old and obsolete i had been running that for several months. For the past two weeks i have been running various builds of CC trunk and couldnt figure out why my AC wifi was slow.<br />I decided to flash MCWRT again and right away my AC wifi is atleast 60% faster while connected at the same link rate to the router as CC does. I&#039;ve done several speed tests to confirm. MCWRT&#039;s wifi is still better performing than CC even with the new drivers.</p>									</div>
