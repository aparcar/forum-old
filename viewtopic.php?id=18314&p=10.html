					<p>HI,<br />Have you taken the backups before flashing the router. If so you can restore all the settings easily. Else you may have to reset all the properties of the router, It may happen that you have to install the new IOS for your router.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi and please help,</p><p>I&#039;m an absolute newbie to DD-WRT. I have a DIR-615, RevC1. I wanted to try DD-WRT before but my router was upgraded to 3.11NA. Not sure if I could have done this all along but I got to recovery window and downgraded to Dlink 3.01 then tried this: openwrt-ar71xx-dir-615c1-squashfs.uni and tried download to router via the recovery window and then again (after going back to 3.01) through the webui and I can ping 192.168.1.1 but no access.</p><p>Reading in some notes I found I may have overlooked something about the serial interface. Do I still have to install serial adapter to gain access through webui? Is there a way around this? I don&#039;t want to build my own f/w from scratch and would like an easier alternative.</p><p>All I really wanted to gain ability to limit bandwidth by IP and make use of improved queuing for efficiency and speed on home network. Have I come to the right place or are other f/w versions discussed here a better fit for me?</p><p>TIA for some guidance!!</p><p>PS..about the backup comment, should I backup my default configuration or my preferred settings with IP addresses, DHCP, Firewall, etc. I should mention that I have Vonage VOIP and SIP should be disabled in the firewall. Please provide detailed answers and don&#039;t be concerned with TMI. Sorry for the lacking of knowledge and needing simplistic instructions. Thanks again.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>armchair</strong> on 12 Dec 2009, 14:19)</p>

					<p>Ok, the Luci wasn&#039;t working with latest .uni dated 12/3/2009. I loaded this one openwrt_r15686_ar71xx-dir-615c1-squashfs.uni and it works as a DCHP router and assigned DHCP leases to my home network devices.</p><p>I&#039;m very unclear about flashing updates safely without bricking router so I may stay with what I have for now. I tried to follow the directions on post #222 by Montyny but I&#039;m not seeing the steps I need to take to find/change the URL and again, I&#039;m concerned with flashing any packages or upgrading to latest trunk. </p><p>If someone feels compelled to lay this out in simplist terms, I&#039;d give it a try. But also would be open to advice to leave it alone for now due to my limitations.</p><p>Update: I think my only option to keep LUCI is just customize this trunk, so I figured out what Montyny in post #222 said by changing first line of the opkg config to: src/gz snapshots <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09.1/ar71xx/packages/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8 … /packages/</a> and then updating packages in LUCI software tab. I was able to install Qos simply by typing Qos in &quot;find package&quot;. I installed the two found Qos files but it took more than one attempt to successfully verify they installed and it only took one at a time. After reboot, I had to set my uplink speed manually to get a successful speed test at speedtest.net Then I made my changes in Qos settings which can be found in LUCI under the Network Tab.</p><p>I thought I would post the info for two reasons. One, to let forum know my progress and two, I asked for more details and the update may help someone else lacking the steps to do so.</p><p>Thanks to all that contribute to this forum and the developers of OpenWrt; very thankful to get this f/w on&nbsp; my cheap router. I&#039;m working with some beta s/w on home network and I hope the router enhancements improve my testing experience.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>armchair</strong> on 15 Dec 2009, 15:37)</p>

					<p>stanv:&nbsp; I do not know the cause, but the DIR-615 C1 reboots itself periodically.&nbsp; it can stay up for 1-6 hours at a time.&nbsp; It could be a hardware issue--there is a watchdog on the chip that will reboot if there are problems.&nbsp; So far, have not been able to capture any log information before the connection drops.</p>									</div>
