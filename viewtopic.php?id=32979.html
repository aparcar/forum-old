					<p>Hello.&nbsp; I have a WRT54GL v1.1 running 10.03.1-RC6.&nbsp; I have always configured OpenWRT from the command line but this time I decided to give LuCI a try.&nbsp; I ran into problems though.&nbsp; When I make changes via LuCI, the router intermittently loses the settings.&nbsp; For instance, I could change the admin password and setup ssh and hit &quot;Save and Apply&quot; only to have it take me back to the login screen with a message that I needed to set a password and configure ssh.&nbsp; Sometimes I could get the password and ssh stuff to apply correctly but when making another change, such as the WAN or WIFI settings, the router would lose everything I had put in and start displaying the message that I needed to set my password and configure ssh again.&nbsp; I&#039;ve noticed that this usually occurs when the &quot;Applying Changes&quot; animation fails to finish.&nbsp; It just sits and spins and never seems to finish saving the changes.&nbsp; When I finally give up after several minutes and reset the router, all the settings are gone.&nbsp; It&#039;s been very frustrating.&nbsp; I did run across the recent shadow password changes and made the appropriate fixes in my menuconfig settings but it didn&#039;t seem to help.</p><p>I get this behavior whether I am running my own custom-built firmware or the stock 10.03.1-RC6 firmware.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been running OpenWRT for several years and have flashed a lot of routers but haven&#039;t seen this intermittent problem before.&nbsp; Can anyone offer any advice?&nbsp; Is my router on the blink?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hmm, could be.&nbsp; My image is 3.7MB and the WRT54GL only has 4MB of flash.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t realize I was that close to filling it up.&nbsp; I&#039;ll go trim it down some and see if that fixes my problems.</p><p>As a general rule, how much should be left available for JFFS2?</p><p>Thanks for your help.&nbsp; I&#039;ll post back with the results.</p>									</div>
