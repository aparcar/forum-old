					<p>Hi<br />i have installed OpenWRT on an RB433Ah and I would like to make the kernel more quiet during boot.<br />I have tried a few ways through make kernel_menuconfig but either the image does not boot or the messages still show up on the serial.</p><p><a href="https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/openwrt-users/2011-March/001507.html">https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/ope â€¦ 01507.html</a> this does not make a bootable image.</p><p>and changing the Kernel Hacking -&gt; Default message log level from 4 to 1 does not make a diffrence.<br />Disabling Kernel Hacking -&gt; Early printk also makes no diffrence.</p><p>The only way to stop kernel messages is changing conloglevel to 1 in /etc/config/system but that happens &quot;late&quot; during boot. I would like it to happen as soon as kernel has loaded.</p>									</div>
