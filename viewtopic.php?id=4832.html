					<p>Hi,</p><p>I got a openvpn server for secure wifi communication and for lan access on the road. When i access the local network via the internet from remote places (like the university <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> i got no speed problems. Ok hands up. On the road i only use imap and stuff.<br />But when i access the lan via the wireless network through the openvpn sever i got really bad performace compared to the avaliable bandwith of the wireless network. I allways have a very good radio connection with 56Mbps (i think that shoud be somthing around 30mbits due to the protocol overhead) <br />So my connection shoud be able to transfer data with around three to four mega-bytes/sec. To test this i tried various file transfer protocols (smb,nfs,ftp) to transfer data. Thease transferes are not at least 1MB/sec! So I cannot even play movies via nfs/smb shares without interruption.</p><p>I hope you guys got any sugestions on performance tuning. I allready thought of moving the openvpn server to my fileserver(dual celeron 500) but that would complicate the firewall extreemly i guess <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>-seri</p>									</div>

					<p>I would not expect BOOYA&nbsp; performance&nbsp; out of OpenVPN on the WRT platform. It&#039;s an itty-bitty CPU with no special encryption hardware.&nbsp; Check command &quot;top&quot; while you are doing some of these transfers and you probably see it is maxed out.&nbsp; I&#039;ll assume you use UDP already. You could drop encryption down to lower levels but that quickly defeats the purpose of using OpenVPN doesn&#039;t it?</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve done some <a href="http://martybugs.net/wireless/openwrt/openvpn.cgi">testing</a> with OpenVPN on a WRT54GS running OpenWrt, and found that OpenVPN limits the throughput to approx 300kbytes/sec (ie, ~3Mbps).</p><p>Cheers,<br />Martin.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t use openvpn but vtun instead. AFAIK they use the same cipher and I have found that Broadcom CPU running at 200MHz is able to encrypt 4-5Mb/s of traffic. I suggest to use WPA and no tunneling (or unencrypted vtun at least) - Broadcom CPUs have hardwired TKIP/WEP/WPA2 encryption/decryption engine. Throughput using WPA2 (AES) is ~12Mbps, which means that it does barely slow it down - I never got above 15Mb/s on Linksys radio....</p>									</div>

					<p>Just wonder, if anybody has tested the OpenVPN performance on newer hardware, like those Draft-N routers...?</p>									</div>
