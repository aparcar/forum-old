					<p>Hi,</p><p>We are trying to get the above LTE card to work on OpenWRT.&nbsp; The basics are functioning.</p><p>The issue is that we need to &quot;register&quot; the card on the carrier before actually connecting to the network.&nbsp; In other words, we want to be able to see the registration info, such as signal strength, technology (4G/3G/2G) in use, etc. before an internet connection is established.</p><p>When OpenWRT starts, we do not want to automatically make an internet connection.&nbsp; This is done manually after the router has booted.</p><p>When the LN930 comes online, we execute the following:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>umbim -n -d $device subscriber</code></pre></div><p>This causes the LN930 to register on the network.</p><p>The connection may stay in this state for some time, 60 minutes or more.</p><p>I then manually tell wan2 (LN930) to come online, and in turn, execute the mbim.sh script.</p><p>What is happening however is that umbim is &quot;stuck&quot;.&nbsp; When it tries to read the capabilities, it just sits for a bit, and then times out, and repeats.&nbsp; Trying to just execute the umbim commands from the command line results in the same timeout issue.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/# umbim -n -d /dev/cdc-wdm0 caps -v

ERROR: mbim message timeout</code></pre></div><br /><p>If we force the LN930 to reset itself, once it is back online the mbim script works fine (and all umbim commands execute quickly).&nbsp; Or if we reboot, and connect immediately, it also works fine.</p><p>Is there something wrong with calling umbim subcriber and then just letting the card, and umbim, sit in this state?&nbsp; If umbim is getting hung, is this a potential issue in umbim or on the LN930 itself?</p><p>Thanks for any advice, or pointers,<br />John</p>									</div>
