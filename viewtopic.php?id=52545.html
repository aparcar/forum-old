					<p>Hi All,<br />I flashed my WD N600 with openwrt (sysupgrade firmware) which completed successfully. (i.e. I was changing from a different openwrt firmware hence the upgrade).</p><p>However, When I log into Putty and enter u/name root it then prompts me for a password.&nbsp; I tried the password I used just before the flash and that does not work -- it just says &quot;access denied&quot;!</p><p>I also tried logging into the router using telnet 192.168.1.1 (in windows command prompt) and that shows me the openwrt splash screen and leaves me at the &quot;root@Openwrt:/#&quot; command prompt.&nbsp; Does anyone know if I can I set a new password from here, as I am stuck with options on how to log into my router, as I think the flash deleted my password details?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>After installation openwrt has no password. It has no way of knowing, how your previous firmware stored password, so naturally the password has been resetted.</p><p>With Telnet you arrive at the console prompt with root rights (just like you did).<br />You use the default Linux/Unix command to change password: passwd</p><p>After settings a password, telnet stops working and you need to use ssh.</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/firstlogin">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/firstlogin</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 2 Sep 2014, 16:16)</p>

					<p>Ok thanks for that.. I must have had a mind blank as I thought I tried passwd in the telnet session.</p>									</div>
