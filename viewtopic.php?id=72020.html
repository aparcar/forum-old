					<p>Today I tried installing openwrt on my router to enable &#039;client mode wireless&#039;.<br />Situation: I&#039;ve several devices which do not have wifi capabilities. Moreover, it is physically not possible to connect them to the main router using cables. Consequently I wanted to convert an old router into a &#039;wireless client&#039; which could then connect to the main router using a wifi bridge. All aforementioned devices would then simply connect with a cable to my wifi client router. In diagram format:</p><p>[device without wifi]-&gt;cable-&gt;[wifi client router]-&gt;wireless connection-&gt;[main router]-&gt;internet.</p><p>It turned out that this was a surprisingly complex task. First I tried setting up a WDS (Wireless Distribution System). Unfortunately, for reasons unknown to me, this just didn&#039;t work. Probably because my wifi client router running OpenWRT and my landlord&#039;s main router (different brand running OEM software) were not compatible. <br />Next I tried setting up OpenWRT in bridged client mode, but this didn&#039;t work either. My client router is a D-Link DSL-2740B with brcm63xx, and apparently openwrt bridge mode only works on brcm24.... (see bridgedclientmodeissues in openwrt wiki)</p><p>In the end I was able to setup a &#039;pseudobridge&#039; using relayd. So far this seems to work well.</p><p>Digging a little deeper, there are some ways to make OpenWRT work in bridge mode using arpnat or ebtables, but this is not well supported: see &quot;projectgus.com/2010/03/wireless-client-bridging-with-openwrt/&quot;</p><p>Nowedays you can buy many cheap commercial network repeaters/extenders. I for instance recently bought the&nbsp; TPLink RE210. All I had to do was enter the main router&#039;s ssid+security information, tick the &quot;client&quot; box and voilla it worked. My question: how do these commercial repeaters work? Given the trouble I had with openwrt, there&#039;s probably not a trivial solution? Do these wifi extenders use trickery like arpnat/ebtables/relayd/...? Also, how would the performance of a commercial network repeater compare to openwrt+relayd (would you expect approximately comparable performance)?</p><p>ps. why on earth can&#039;t I put urls in my post? This is quite inconvenient...</p>									</div>
