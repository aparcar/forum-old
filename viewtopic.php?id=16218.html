					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to run a HP Laserjet P1005 with p910nd on an Asus WL-500g. I successfully did that with a Laserjet 1020 on the same machine before.</p><br /><p>It seems like I&#039;m having the same problem like described here: <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=11924">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=11924</a>.<br />The printer is recognised, the hotplud tries to write the firmware, but I can&#039;t print. </p><p>I always get &quot;Finished job: 112811 bytes received, 0 bytes sent&quot;. When using ./usb_printerid /dev/usb/lp0 from <a href="http://oleg.wl500g.info/hplj/">http://oleg.wl500g.info/hplj/</a> I get:</p><p>GET_DEVICE_ID string:<br />MFG:Hewlett-Packard;MDL:HP LaserJet P1005;CMD:ACL;CLS:PRINTER;DES:HP LaserJet P1005;</p><p>So it seems, that the firmware isn&#039;t transmitted successfully. I tried the .dl file from <a href="http://oleg.wl500g.info/hplj/">http://oleg.wl500g.info/hplj/</a> as well as a self produced one with the software from <a href="http://foo2zjs.rkkda.com">http://foo2zjs.rkkda.com</a>/ but they seem to be the same and they have the same results.</p><p>Can anybody help me?</p><p>thanks Bjoern</p>									</div>
