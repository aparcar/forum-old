Flashed many times no change, using Upgrade and recovery image. <br/>For some reason i cannot configure wireless channel below 11. If i set any channel below wireless radio does not turn on. Tried with all kinds of setting and it seems setting are no problemay other suggestions?

Wired works with 10.3 and 12.09, but wireless...I recently changed miniPCI card with the same type (AR5008), to see if I solved wifi connection problems, but new card is detected randomly (only power off/on). After hostapd is started all network connection is lost, LEDs were still blinking, like everything is up and running.</p><p>I also checked wiki how to change miniPCI card, but this one is the same, the same drivers.</p>									</div>
