					<p>- make sure you have a root password set (do I really need to tell anyone how to do this? go try a different firmware)<br />- edit mime.convs and mime.types in /etc/cups, uncomment the lines starting with &quot;application/octet-stream&quot; to allow raw printing<br />- restart cupsd if needed<br />- Log into cups from a browser http://router:631 (user: root)<br />- Add the printer (it&#039;s probably already there)</p><p>From a windows machine<br />- control panel -&gt; printers -&gt; add new printer<br />- network printer<br />- URL: http://router:631/printers/USB (or whatever url shows up from the browser earlier)<br />- Enter in the root usrename and password<br />- Select the printer type</p><p>All processing will be done on the client computer and the raw printer commands will be sent to cups. It&#039;s possible to configure cups for the printer type and just tell the applications it&#039;s a postscript printer but that&#039;s trickier to setup; you&#039;ll have to figure that out on your own.</p>									</div>
