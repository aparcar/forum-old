					<p>After having successfully installed OpenWrt on my DWL-7100AP, thanks to information on this forum, I got bitten by the OpenWrt bug.<br />I started looking for the next upgrade victim (and the next challenge), and I think I found it in the form of my Netgear FVS338 VPN-firewall.</p><p>Unfortunately this device is not yet supported by OpenWRT and Iâ€™m starting to realize that adding support for a new device (even if all the individual components of the device are supported) require a far lot more knowledge of the inner workings of the linux-kernel and OpenWrt than I got, so thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m writing this.</p><br /><p>The Netgear FVS338 is a router/fw with a wan-port, 8 lan-ports and a serial-port (console). The firmware is linux-based and it uses redboot for bootstrap.</p><p>The hardware consists of:<br />Intel IXP422 Xscale CPU<br />16MB Flash (Intel JS28F128 StrataFlash)<br />32MB Ram (2x Mira P2V28S40CTP 128Mbit SDRAM)<br />WAN-port: Altima AC101LKQ 10/100 Ethernet PTY<br />LAN-Switch: Broadcom BCM5337M</p><br /><p>Netgear have made the GPL-code available for download at: <a href="ftp://downloads.netgear.com/files/GPL/fvs338_v3.0.2-21_src.tar.bz2">ftp://downloads.netgear.com/files/GPL/f … rc.tar.bz2</a><br />(They use the Montavista tool chain though, so I canâ€™t easily try to compile it.)</p><p>All this makes me believe that it would be reasonably easy to add support for the FVS338, provided that you know how to go about it.</p><p>Unfortunately many hours of google searches have showed there are a tremendous amount of texts/mails/forum-post written about linux on the arm processor, but I havenâ€™t found much information that I feel is relevant and up to date as to how to do this.</p><p>So, anyone got some hints or information about where/how I should start?<br />Or does anyone with the needed expertise care to help me? :-)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>NMI</strong> on 3 Dec 2007, 20:55)</p>
