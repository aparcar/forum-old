					<p>I want to install OpenWRT on Linksys EA6300 V1. </p><p>I downloaded the file mentioned at &quot;Firmware OpenWrt Install URL&quot; on the page &quot;Techdata: Linksys EA6300 v1&quot;, followed the steps mentioned in the page &quot;Installing OpenWrt&quot; and uploaded it via the upgrade firmware option from stock firmware GUI. The router reboots but returns in stock again, but to a lower version. Tried it again but same result. Doing a hard reset (30-30-30) or factory reset before and after install also does not solve the issue</p><p>Also tried it using the the actions described at &quot;Installing OpenWrt via TFTP&quot; but same result.</p><p>What am I doing wrong? </p><p>Can it be related to the fact that the uploaded file is a trx-file and not a bin-file, since the page &quot;OpenWrt image conversion&quot; mentions dat trx-files are used for upgrading openWrt only? But cannot find a bin-file for this router.</p><p>All all highly appreciated!</p>									</div>
