					<p>The current router I have right now can&#039;t max the download and upload speeds due to its hardware limitation. I&#039;m thinking of buying a raspi 3 and install openwrt on it. I know I can use a different distro on raspi but that means I have to reconfigure all my scripts again, I don&#039;t want to do that. For those who have tried openwrt on raspi 3 please just tell me whether everything works well or not and which version of openwrt you&#039;re using on your raspi 3. Thank you.</p><p>The setup is like this: Raspi 3 + LTE USB Modem + OpenVPN + Some python scripts that I have. Can it get at least 30Mbps of download speed? I&#039;m not gonna plug in an ethernet cable and expect 100Mbps of download speed since I don&#039;t have that in my house.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hillz</strong> on 23 Apr 2016, 12:02)</p>

					<p>Dont. R3 has USB2.0-based 100 mbit network card. Its not even capable of 100 mbit full duplex alone and share bandwidth with other usb devices, for example with second USB nic. USB 2.0 for ethernet is very bad choice, avoid it.<br />Banana pi is better choice. Although its SCM micro gbit adapter crashes on jumbo frames. By default they are disabled everywhere but if anyone enables them on their windows then banana will panic very often.<br />Best choice would be mini PC with intel network cards, not realtek GBE which for long had painful troubles with default r8169 driver.<br />Yes, bugs are everywhere, thats linux world !</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bolvan</strong> on 23 Apr 2016, 10:19)</p>

Its possible you won&#039;t get that speed even if LTE actually gives 50 mbps.<br />Not because rpi3 cpu is slow - its fast enough.<br />But openvpn architecture is based on tun which itself will lower available bandwidth.<br />Cpu has to switch many times between user mode and kernel mode. That&#039;s always been not too good. That&#039;s the reason why microsoft moved graphical subsystem from usermode to kernelmode in NT 4.0, and its much faster than xorg on linux. Apple did the same in macos.<br />rpi3 has 4 cores and it can mitigate the problem. I havent tested on multicore cpu. On my Dlink dir-825 (mips 650 mhz) I only get 8-9 mpbs with 30% idle cpu and 50 mbps connection between endpoints. And I use udp, adjusted mtu to no fragmentation, tried changing all available options with no effect.<br />Alternative to openvpn would be l2tp+ipsec or pptp. Its whole in kernel mode.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bolvan</strong> on 24 Apr 2016, 09:28)</p>
