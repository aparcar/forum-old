					<p>Hello,<br />I&#039;m very new to open-wrt.</p><p>My flashed router connect to wifi and repeat the wifi on my laptop. <br />I would like to run all the trafic through an external vpn (so use the router as a vpn client), without mistake (un-allow any traffic to pass through an other way than the configured vpn), and add a feature that disconnect if the vpn connection disconnect. </p><p>How to set the router as an open vpn client ? I started here : <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.openvpn">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.openvpn</a>,<br />did that : opkg update<br />opkg install openvpn-openssl openvpn-easy-rsa&nbsp; , through telnet (maybe it won&#039;t be the best option after, should i use ssh, other topic), but now i&#039;m a little lost since this page is so set the flashed router as a vpn server apparently.</p><p>Can you help me to connect through a vpn?</p><p>Thanks..</p>									</div>
