					<p>More on &quot;arriving somewhere&quot;... I saw an interesting note on the &quot;Buyer&#039;s Guide&quot; wiki page: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buyerguide#price_comparison_for_currently_purchasable_hardware">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buyerguide# … e_hardware</a></p><p>It contains an Amazon link that does a search for &quot;OpenWrt&quot;. Not surprisingly, this turns up a number of routers that all mention OpenWrt. This gets around the strong policy that &quot;OpenWrt does not recommend hardware&quot;. Instead, Amazon (and its customers) do the recommending.</p><p>So I can envision a buyers guide page that starts by telling people to look several places:</p><p>- Look for &quot;OpenWrt&quot; on Amazon, and read the individual reviews that mention OpenWrt on Amazon, to see people&#039;s experience<br/>- Look at the individual Detail page to see if a) there&#039;s a link to firmware and b) installation instructions<br/>- Look up the router in the Forum to see whether people report problems</p><p>Between all three of these, a novice would likely get a router that&#039;s going to be an easy install and work well for them.</p>									</div>

That is not the image you want to convey. Newbies look for stable releases, not for bleeding edge stuff. </p><p>If someone wants to play with trunk, that&#039;s fine - they just need to suck it up. The fact that Chaos Calmer might be close to release (I think developers aimed at releasing it around the beginning of 2015, but that plan obviously tanked) and maybe rather stable as a result does not change anything to that. Trunk is meant for development, stuff breaks. One should not recommend trunk to new users.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Borromini</strong> on 29 Apr 2015, 22:18)</p>

Alternatively, I suppose you could have something that breaks and figuring out whether it is Luci or the core firmware could be slightly harder if they were integrated together. The nightlies really are intended for developers and there are other issues that users can run into with trunk. Like the inability to install packages after a new revision is uploaded since the kernel versions no longer match. This is also a common question that comes up on the forums. </p><p>I really strongly urge that new users stick to stable releases unless they have a very compelling reason to use something newer and are fairly savvy with the linux command line.</p>									</div>

					<p>Cleaned up some of the chipsets listed for newer TP-Link routers, which are pretty easy to find and relatively cheap. In general, this is what I recommend to most people.
