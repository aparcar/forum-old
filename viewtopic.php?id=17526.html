					<p>You never want to use NTFS with Linux. Yes it has gotten alot more stable, but it not close enough to perfect to be a daily use standard. Even on a desktop running Ubuntu with a 2ghz CPU, you see CPU load spike up when reading and writing NTFS. Given the ability of these devices processing units and it&#039;s ability to become corrupt, it&#039;s surprising that you never had data lose even in read mode.</p>									</div>
