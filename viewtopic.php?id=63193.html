					<p>Does anyone know of any testing or documentation that explains the value of increasing Flash MB and how this would (if at all) affect performance? I run the router for standard internet browsing and streaming services. I also use it as a DNS cache.</p><p>If I have two routers, one with 8MB Flash and a second with 16MB Flash, is it better to use one in a certain capacity over the other (e.g., using one as a DNS server over the other)? Or is it unlikely to make a performance difference?</p>									</div>

					<p>You don&#039;t &quot;use&quot; any ROM at runtime, none at all. The flash is used to store the firmware and (at runtime-) mostly static configuration files. </p><p>On a normal router system, OpenWrt won&#039;t write to your flash at runtime, unless you&#039;re currently making changes to the configuration, and it will even hardly read from flash after booting has completed (because by then everything that&#039;s needed to connect to the net, do routing and packet filtering (aka firewall) is already loaded, cached in- and running from RAM). Size of your flash doesn&#039;t matter at all, as long as it&#039;s big enough to hold your firmware plus a few erase blocks (e.g. x* 64KB) to hold your configuration. In practice this means, 4 MB flash are still possible to store everything needed for a router &amp; access point, but this is getting tight and &gt;= 8 MB flash provide more options and and for long(er) term supportability.</p><p>Yes, OpenWrt is more flexible than your typical vendor firmware, so it&#039;s possible to install packages that might require more flash accesses (read and/ or write) at runtime (for server like tasks), but in those cases you&#039;d know your requirements and wouldn&#039;t ask this way (besides pretty much any of these advanced uses imply putting the volatile data on some storage other than the flash ROM, with its limited write cycles, tiny sizes and inflexible erase block sizes). In practical terms, read/ write speed of your flash is never going to be an issue and it certainly doesn&#039;t influence your routing speed, number of parallel connections, etc.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>slh</strong> on 7 Mar 2016, 08:06)</p>
