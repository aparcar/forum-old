					<p>I have a Motorola WR850G v2 that had the v4.03 firmware on it, and I tried to flash it to the experimental SquashFS build.&nbsp; I made sure boot_wait was turned on and then I ran the firmware upgrade page and everything seemed to go ok, but when I unplugged it and re-plugged it to try it out, nothing worked.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t ping it (its IP is supposed to be 192.168.1.200) and I couldn&#039;t telnet to it.&nbsp; When I turn it on, only the power light comes on, then if I plug in a cable, the light for that cable comes on as well.&nbsp; The Wireless light never turns on.&nbsp; If I press the reset button on the back, the 4 LAN lights turn orange for as long as I hold it, then when I release, the lights go out, and about one second later, all the lights turn orange (except for wireless which stays off) then green.&nbsp; The lights stay green even when nothing is plugged into their ports.&nbsp; If I plug a cable in the light turns orange.&nbsp; Despite the change in light patterns, I am still unable to ping or telnet into the device after having pressed the reset button.&nbsp; If I hold the reset button while powering on the device (supposedly entering failsafe mode) it does the same thing with the lights I described above and I still can&#039;t telnet or ping it.&nbsp; Any suggestions for getting this thing back on its feet?&nbsp; At this point, I&#039;d be happy just having the Motorola firmware back.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have a v.1 motorola WR850G router and almost bricked it some weeks ago. I tried the pin-shorting procedure described in some websites, with no luck. Desperately, I just shorted a lot of random pins on the flash chip while the router was on, until the router answered to pings.</p><p>When I bricked the router, it kept the Power led blinking every 6 seconds, and no ping got any response.<br />After shorting some of the pins (don&#039;t know exactly which, as I slided a little screwdriver over all the pins of the flash IC - pins 24 to 1. This is absolutely dangerous, but worked for me), the power led remained lit, without blinking and pings started to respond. That was the moment I started a tftp transfer with the v4.03 motorola firmware and brought the router again to life. I cannot say which pins do the work (and I think i&#039;m not going to test again now that I&#039;ve managed to put openwrt in it). The only thing I can tell is what I did, thinking that I wouldn&#039;t be able to recover the router. I kept sending pings until the led pattern changed and pings got a response.</p><p>Good luck with your router.<br />LtGoose.</p>									</div>

					<p>Admittedly I&#039;m new to this.&nbsp; I have a moto wr850g, I upgraded to the dd-wrt firmware, things went ok.&nbsp; I was trying to change settings to use the router as a repeater when, nothing.&nbsp; It stopped responding. Now all I have is the power light and after a few minutes the wireless light.&nbsp; Neither flashes (the wireless led used to), and plugging in Ethernet cables elicits no responses.&nbsp; </p><p>If you could redirect me to any links or tutorials explaining how to ping with telnet, or any useful programs for determining the status of my router, it would be appreciated.</p>									</div>
