					<p>Need a lil help here if anyone can please, been trying to build a router setup with 3g/4g and cups print server support (with the intent of getting it to support air print for a usb printer) on a Wr710n v2.1 (8meg flash), I&#039;ve been using ROOter as a base then adding in the unofficial openwrt printing packages feed from <a href="https://github.com/FranciscoBorges/openwrt-printing-packages">https://github.com/FranciscoBorges/open â€¦ g-packages</a> also using extroot to give 8gig to overlay 512m to swap and an extra data partition of another 8gig which are correct mounted.</p><p>The issue is though it compiles all fine and the majority of packages install (had to update fontconfig to later version as it was causing a weird fs-cache error) when I come to to install ghostscript on the router it fails, first throwing sha256sum mismatched, so I forced checksum ignore, reinstall, overwrite and fresh config, I&#039;ve rebuilt the router more than once and was starting to bang my head in frustration till I noticed this</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Downloading file:/data/printer/packages/printing/ghostscript_9.06-2_ar71xx.ipk.<br />Ignored ghostscript sha256sum mismatch.<br />Configuring ghostscript.<br />Collected errors:<br /> * copy_file_chunk: Unable to read all data<br /> * set_flags_from_control: Failed to open <strong>//</strong>usr/lib/opkg/info/ghostscript.control: No such file or directory.</p></blockquote></div><p>I tried again forcing a diff install location just to see if it would make any difference</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Downloading file:/data/printer/packages/printing/ghostscript_9.06-2_ar71xx.ipk.<br />Ignored ghostscript sha256sum mismatch.<br />Configuring ghostscript.<br />Collected errors:<br /> * copy_file_chunk: Unable to read all data<br /> * set_flags_from_control: Failed to open /data/tmp//usr/lib/opkg/info/ghostscript.control: No such file or directory.</p></blockquote></div><p>Any insights or help much appreciated</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>toxfire</strong> on 7 May 2016, 12:12)</p>

Thanks to the technology you keep pointing people towards: internet search; google does a fine job of helping to find even multiple threads for similar topics... (If I could wish for something, it would be that all OPs hang through to their threads until the issue is solved and then add [SOLVED} to the topic/title that would make forum search more fun, but I digress)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But telling people to RTFM first certainly is neither civil nor nice behavior in my opinion, rather the words rude and premature come to mind. Unfortunately your actions, words (in another thread) and even your signature make it clear that this behavor is not accidental but that you are waging a campaign to &quot;improve&quot; the forums. While I applaud the eeffort to improve things I disagree with your definition of improvement. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And let&#039;s face it, the OP in this thread handled himself quite well and gracefully; neither me nor you made a good show for the forum regulars (so thee is lots to improve behavior-wise for me as well)... </p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>

As he explained in another post he justifies his lack of manners and hostility as measures to help people to learn to help themselves (yes he truly found a way to convince himself that &quot;playing the forum troll&quot; actually is a friendly and generous act of support; so probability of him settling in with the general laisser-faire and open friendlyness of the forums is pretty low). <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Actually, I do not aim at influencing Max&#039;s behavior any longer (for some time now); all I want to achieve is to ameliorate the &quot;damage&quot; his attitude does towards, mostly new, poster to this forum. It would be a shame if his &quot;zealotry&quot; would scare away people and make them afraid to ask for advice and help. All of use started at some point as novices I assume so scaring the novices of today will reduce the potential set of the masters of tomorrow (and people will just contribute to friendlier projects)...</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>
