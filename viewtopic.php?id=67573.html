					<p>I don&#039;t think there is a way to mount a fat drive automatically, at least i never found one, you can try putting the mount command in etc/rc.local (System &gt; Startup if you have Luci) and that should at least mount it at boot i think, although i&#039;ve never tried it myself.</p>									</div>

					<p>Lets check that we have the correct nomenclature here.&nbsp; There is exFat and vFat files systems on the OpenWrt side and EXfat and FAT32 on the Windows side.&nbsp; </p><p>I know that micro-SD cards 64GB and above are coming delivered with EXfat, which is a Microsoft proprietary format.&nbsp; I am not aware that any other device is formatted as such, at least by default, and honestly not clear on what advantages EXfat has if any.</p><p>I use FAT32 with kmod-fs-vfat for most of my devices as I run Windoze and suck up the 2GB FS limitation.&nbsp; I have just checked my Kingston MLWG2 and it has no issue booting the SD Card formatted FAT32.&nbsp; </p><p>My global config section is identical.<br />My mount sections specify the uuid and file system, but I configure the devices thru the Luci interface and mount points does the heavy lifting.&nbsp; I also have Samba installed and manage permissions thru that.</p><p>May pay to list all the packages you installed for USB.&nbsp; </p><p>If you truly are running EXFAT, then you may wish to see this post.&nbsp; I did try to use exFat and just gave up.<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=65745">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=65745</a><br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=64608">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=64608</a></p><p>There are a few other refs to EXFAT if you search the forum</p>									</div>
