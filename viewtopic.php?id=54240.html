					<p>Hi, everyone. </p><p>I have kind of strange error on my router <strong>(TP-LINK WDR3600)</strong></p><p>Today I try to flash new firmware to my router because I wanted to try OpenWRT again.</p><p>So I replaced old TP-LINK firmware with new Superwrt - <a href="http://www.superwrt.eu/en/firmware/tp-link-wdr3600/">http://www.superwrt.eu/en/firmware/tp-link-wdr3600/</a>&nbsp; I think everybody here know what Superwrt is... (Openwrt with integrated LuCi&nbsp; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr3600#custom.openwrt.image.with.luci.integrated">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl- â€¦ integrated</a></p><p>Then I successfully applied sysupgrade firmware. Everything was good but then I try to set my IP adress to STATIC IP (my internet provider have custom static ip address which I need to set into router to have internet access).</p><p>So I clicked on <strong>INTERFACE &gt; LAN &gt; EDIT</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;Then I changed Protocol to Static address and I put my IP address&nbsp; X.X.X.137 , 255.255.255.240 netmask, gateway X.X.X.X etc...</p><p>Everything works and then I wanted to create (by mistake) <strong>Bridged connection</strong> between <strong>eth0 interface</strong> and <strong>LAN interface</strong> with the same address which I put into static address bar. I put only IP address X.X.X.137</p><p>After I save my settings, <strong>I cannot ping router, cannot access router</strong>. Even if I put cable from router to PC I get <strong>NO NETWORK</strong> is identified. So devices cant communicate to each other. I try several IP addresses to connect but everything without success. I set my PC IP to 192.168.1.2 and try to connect but that wont help too.</p><p>LEDs on my router are switched on (theyre flashing) looks like I have bad IP configuration. I dont know... I also try 30/30/30 reset and nothing happened.</p><p>I think that I brick my router :-) but if you have some good ideas how to get back lost connection let me know.</p><p>Thanks for help!</p><p><strong>*EDIT</strong></p><p>Today I try failsafe, SYS light is flashing 2x per second but I cant telnet or ping 192.168.1.1 (destination host unreachable error) I set my IP for 192.168.1.2 and mask 255.255.255.0. Any ideas???</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fatal_error</strong> on 27 Nov 2014, 11:55)</p>

					<p>OK so I found answer here !</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=46537">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=46537</a></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> SherlockS wrote:

    1. Unplug and power off router
    2. Go to IPv4 settings on pc and enter static ip 192.168.1.2 subnet 255.255.255.0 -&gt; Don&#039;t confirm yet
    3. Power on router
    4. When settings LED starts blinking, press reset button
    5. When settings LED starts blinking rapidly, connect the ethernet cable from the pc to WAN port and confirm IP settings on pc.
    6. Open putty telnet session and connect to 192.168.1.1 port 23
    7. In telnet do the following things one after another (taken from here):

        Kill the broken OWRT firmware

        mtd -r erase rootfs_data

        enter

&quot;. It then told me it was rebooting and after waiting a while (2 minute or so) there was no response so I just manually unplugged the power and put it back, set the PC&#039;s ip to obtain address automatically and accessed the router on the default openwrt ip address.</code></pre></div><p>ACTUALLY, THIS HELPS IN MY CASE<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>1) Set your PC to 192.168.1.2 (click OK until done)
2) Connect you PC to LAN port no. 1
3) Open cmd/console and ping (&quot;ping 192.168.1.1&quot; for linux/unix, &quot;ping 192.168.1.1 -t&quot; for windows)
4) Reboot/Power cycle your router and then the ping will return timeouts. After some time you will get the first ping reply from the router, then quickly press WPS/RESET button many times, and then let it be. Ping will be continue.

If everything went fine, now you can telnet your router.

You should see OpenWrt console. 

Kill the broken OWRT firmware

    mtd -r erase rootfs_data

    enter</code></pre></div><br /><p>THANKS A LOT GUYS, THIS FORUM IS GREAT!!!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fatal_error</strong> on 19 Jan 2015, 13:03)</p>
