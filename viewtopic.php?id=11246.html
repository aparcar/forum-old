					<p>Hello!</p><p>I have almost successfully moded my WRT54G V22 for MMC/SD. Driver loads ok <br />and can mount MMC, but when writing or doing something more complicated than<br />&#039;ls -al&#039; on MMC card, WRT54G frezes and I&#039;ve no other choice than pull the plug.</p><p>I&#039;ve double checked all solderings and wiring. System is stable until I&#039;ll access /dev/mmc.<br />Even cat /proc/partitions will freze WRT.</p><p>I&#039;ve compiled kernel image using HOWTO:&nbsp; </p><p><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=8543">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=8543</a> </p><p>and tried both standard mmc -driver and optimized.</p><p>dmesg says all ok and detects card size etc.</p><p>Janne</p>									</div>

					<p>Since I got it sorted you by researching forum, I thought it would benice to share with others. Problem was finally missing GPIO mask, soldering was after all ok. What I did was &quot;echo &quot;9c&quot; &gt; /proc/diag/gpio. After that 32M and 1 Gb SD card started working like angel with opteamized mmc -driver module that is available on this forum. Before fixing GPIO mask wrt54g v22 didn&#039;t really crash but it did run out of memory and did not response for anything for few minutes. However this is all now history and I&#039;m running irssi and lighthttpd on my SD card. This is was afterall quite simple to task and the benefits are superb.</p>									</div>
