					<p>Luis,</p><p>What features do you need from the router?</p><p>I&#039;ve not measured it yet, but I&#039;ve recently got a TL-WR703N and that&#039;s powered by micro-USB, so can&#039;t draw more than about 2.5W (although I suspect it draws considerably less). Of course, it&#039;s very limited in terms of connectivity: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr703n">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr703n</a></p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Sam</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello Sam,</p><p>thank you for your replay. Well I think WLAN is the most important feature. USB is not nessesary. </p><p>What a pitty that the TL-WR703N is not yet available in Europe. </p><p>Thank, </p><p>Luis</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t suppose this <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/networking-and-wi-fi/pogoplug-pro/4505-3243_7-34195360.html">PogoPlug Pro</a> device has been supported by OpenWRT, yet. Otherwise, you can configure it as a WLAN router. It is built on a dual-core ARM6J1 CPU clocked @1.2GHz with 128MB / 128MB RAM / NAND space, 4 USB2 ports, and a built-in giGE port (can be configured as WAN) and WiFi (can be configured as WLAN).</p>									</div>

					<p>Dear Dougal,</p><p>I also have the same idea. That&#039;s why I bought the ASUS WL-500g Premium (V1) to also be able to have enough connectivity.<br />Without anything (or maybe with a connected HDD. I forgot which measurement I made) I think I had a consumption of 8W.<br /><a href="http://www.asus.com/Networks/Wireless_Routers/WL500g_Premium/#specifications">http://www.asus.com/Networks/Wireless_R â€¦ ifications</a></p><p>And to get more performance you can use (what I though using) this super simple solar tracker (without electronic parts) :<br /><a href="http://www.josepino.com/?simple_sun_tracker">http://www.josepino.com/?simple_sun_tracker</a></p><p>Please take me informed about the solar power (and a plan of what you deployed to manage power supply of your panel) to use with your installation.</p><p>Sincerely thanks and have a nice day,</p><p>Miguipda ;-)</p>									</div>
