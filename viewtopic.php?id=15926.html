					<p>I spent a lot of time trying to get my IPTV box (Singtel&#039;s mio TV) to work with my Asus WL500GP (kamikaze). I tried igmp proxy but somehow that didnt work, maybe because igmp v3 is needed. Finally I found a very simple way to enable IPTV. Just set your IPTV device to be in the same virtual LAN as your modem.</p><p>1. Make the following changes in /etc/config/network</p><p>config switch eth0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan0&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;2 3 4 5*&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan1&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;0 1 5&quot;</p><p>In this case, 0&#039; is the wan port, while &#039;1&#039; is your IPTV device. &#039;5&#039; is the trunk port to the CPU.</p><p>2. Plug in your IPTV box to port &#039;1&#039;. In the case of Asus WL500GP, its the second LAN port from the right (labelled LAN1).</p><p>In this configuration, your home network sits behind openwrt&#039;s firewall, while the IPTV box is outside the firewall, which is ok.</p><p>Note that this only works for IPTV boxes. If you are looking at IPTV clients running on your PC, search for &#039;multicast&#039; in the forum. </p><p><img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
