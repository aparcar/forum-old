					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I have been trying PPTP to work but I am facing DNS resolve problem. </p><p>My configuration is as follows:</p><p>/etc/config/network:</p><p>config interface &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option ifname eth0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option proto dhcp</p><p>config interface &#039;wan_pptp&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto pptp<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option server &#039;orange.connect.net.pk&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option username &#039;dummy&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option password &#039;dummy&#039;</p><p>I have made rules to allow GRE. The result is that PPTP connection is stable and I have an IP on both the interfaces wan and wan_pptp. The problem starts when I try to access the internet like <a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a> but it doesn&#039;t work. Ping to &#039;<a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a>&#039; doesnt work either but ping to 8.8.8.8 is working perfectly. Also If I access any website via its IP it works but not if I use a domain name. </p><p>I have checked /tmp/resolv.conf.auto and there are name servers already present. I also have checked /tmp/resolv.conf.pptp and there are nameservers provided by my PPTP ISP are also there but no domain is resolved still. Also using the public DNS servers like 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 are not working. </p><p>Funny thing is that orange.connect.net.pk is resolved successfully to dial the PPTP connection but after that nothing works on domain</p><p>the logs tell me that the DNS requests are sent to the DNS servers but there are no replies:</p><p>daemon.info dnsmasq[9886]: forwarded urs.microsoft.com to 10.101.10.5<br />daemon.info dnsmasq[9886]: forwarded urs.microsoft.com to 10.101.10.10<br />daemon.info dnsmasq[9886]: forwarded urs.microsoft.com to 10.101.10.10<br />daemon.info dnsmasq[9886]: forwarded urs.microsoft.com to 10.101.10.5<br />daemon.info dnsmasq[9886]: query[A] urs.microsoft.com from 192.168.0.204</p><p>I have enabled firewalling on bridged interfaces by editing /etc/sysctl.conf<br />net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1</p><p>Does that make my PPTP connection problematic and because of this DNS replies are not reaching my router???</p><p>If there is a firewall/iptable rule please do share. Any kind of help will be appreciated.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>khmtambi</strong> on 12 Nov 2015, 08:44)</p>

					<p>It&#039;s best to use dnsmasq as a local forwarder. You can define some kind of split dns by defining special nameservers for your own domain. You won&#039;t need to fiddle with per interface nameservers or /etc/resolv.conf etc then -&gt; there is only 127.0.0.1.</p><p>See <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/dhcp">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/dhcp</a> and <a href="http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html">http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/do â€¦ q-man.html</a></p><p>You will be interested in <br />&quot;server &nbsp; &nbsp; list of strings &nbsp; &nbsp; (none) &nbsp; &nbsp; -S &nbsp; &nbsp; List of DNS servers to forward requests to. See the dnsmasq man page for syntax details. &quot;</p><p>i.e. in uci<br />/etc/config/dhcp</p><p>[... first section ...]</p><p>list server &#039;8.8.8.8&#039;<br />list server &#039;8.8.4.4&#039;<br />list server &#039;/internal.thekelleys.org.uk/192.168.1.1&#039;</p><p>This variation of what Thekelleys man page says will send queries for machines within internal.thekelleys.org.uk to 192.168.1.1 while other queries outside that domain will use google&#039;s public dns servers.</p>									</div>
