					<p>Hello there,</p><p>I install OpenWRT on my brand new WRT54GL. There where no problems.<br />But I have a problem to connect to Internet by PC. With the WRT54GL I have no problem to update the system or download new packages. For me it means that the connection to the modem works.<br />As the modem I use a Arcor Wlan 200 modem in modem mode. I am not sure that all is fine with the modem mode but if I can download packages it seams that it work.</p><p>If I have a look in the Firewall Log View (I am using X-Wrt) I see that all output and input is DROP. But I have no rules there.</p><p>What kind of information is need from my side?</p><p>Hope someone can give me a hind.</p><p>Thanks </p><p>Dirk</p>									</div>
