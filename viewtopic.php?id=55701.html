					<p>I recently installed flexget on my openWRT router. <br />I have a linux based NAS that is running transmission and also flexget by the way.<br /> When i execute flexget from the router which is configured to connect to transmission on the NAS, flexget complains that the transmissionrpc version needs to be 0.11 or higher. Which it is!!

I say this because, i installed transmission on another ubuntu computer and when i try with that, i get the same error.</p><p>RPC is enabled in transmission.</p><p>However i&#039;ve been successfully using flexget with transmission running the same Nas for over a year now. Im just trying to move flexget on my router.</p><p>I would really appreciate any feedback.<br />Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>alirz</strong> on 10 Feb 2015, 21:48)</p>
