					<p>I just got a Gateway 7001, which seemed to me like the best hardware available for $45:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Gateway/7001">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har … teway/7001</a></p><p>Is there any way to flash this router without using a serial port?&nbsp; I&#039;ve read that redboot can be accessed over telnet, but in the boot text provided in the wiki, redboot starts out with an IP address of 0.0.0.0, so I assume that telnet has been disabled.</p><p>I ordered a TTL-232R-3V3, which connects to USB and provides a 3.3v serial connection.&nbsp; Was ordering this a correct decision?&nbsp; This cable is mentioned in the NLSU2 wiki:<br /><a href="http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/HowTo/AddASerialPort">http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/HowTo/AddASerialPort</a></p><p>Another note: The Gateway 7001 has a 266MHz processor, 8MB flash, 32MB ram, dual independent ethernet ports, 2 minipci slots with two Atheros cards (a and bg), and it&#039;s only $45 at some online stores.&nbsp; Is there some reason why these aren&#039;t selling like crazy?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey pmarks - you get anywhere with this? I was also looking at the 7001. Looks like a bargain imho.</p>									</div>

					<p>I was able to connect to the serial port by getting a TTL-232R-3V3 and rearranging the pins.&nbsp; From there, I managed to install OpenWRT.&nbsp; It boots, but I so far haven&#039;t been able to get any of the network interfaces working right.&nbsp; I get an &quot;NPE-B not running&quot; error on the wired ports, and an EEPROM checksum error on the wireless.</p><p>I also managed to upgrade to RedBoot 2.04, but that didn&#039;t seem to fix anything.</p><p>So, the platform seems to have some promise for the future, but right now it&#039;s very underdeveloped.</p>									</div>

					<p>A follow-up:</p><p>Once I figured out how to un-break my bootloader (updating it was a BAD idea), and how to work with the NPE microcode (I put some info in the Wiki), and how to fix my Wifi card&#039;s EEPROM (random hardware fluke, I think), everything&#039;s working nicely now.</p><p>As of this writing, you can still buy the router for $45 from here:<br /><a href="http://ascendtech.us/Itemdesc.asp?ic=NETWGW80211ABG&amp;eq=&amp;Tp=">http://ascendtech.us/Itemdesc.asp?ic=NE … q=&amp;Tp=</a></p><p>It&#039;s a great platform to play with OpenWRT on; just keep in mind that you need a 3.3V serial interface to get Redboot configured initially.</p>									</div>
