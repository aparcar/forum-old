					<p>wrt1900ac v1, system stable with 27/12 build, but had initial issues with 2GHz wifi.</p><p>The frequent reboots seems to have been solved with the new kernel changes, but now it instead it seems the 2GHz wifi is less stable compared to the 4.4 based build. Wifi is not entirely stable in the 4.4 build either with often loosing connectivity between wifi stations (ethernet&lt;-&gt;wifi works), but in the 27/12 build 2GHz wifi (i think, not entirely clear, have the same SSID on both channels) sometimes completely loose network connectivity, not even ARP of the wrt1900ac works. Strangely it seems DHCP do work.</p><p>A reboot fixes the wifi in both versions. If it were not for this then the new version would have much higher uptime (currently 6 days).</p>									</div>

					<p>@beginner67890 I just had another reboot, and I can tell it is related to at least the processes sleep, tinyproxy and uhttpd (luci). Because I had a crash on all of the three. I dont have other resources running on the router, and if I deactivate all three of the above, the router is stable (20days no reboot, if I enable one of them, reboot will happen in the next days). The moment I use one of these, there is a large probability, it will sooner or later crash/reboot. I honestly dont know what you mean with &quot;I just ran a test to sleep for just 1 second without difficulty&quot; ? Like I said... these processes just rise the probability of a reboot. If I let a sleep 20 script run, the router will reboot in the next x days for sure. If I open Luci maybe 500 times, it will reboot one of the trys. If I use tinyproxy then whatever random time, it will reboot. If I let the router just &quot;be&quot;, and have nothing run on it, and it just routes traffic, it is stable. OpenVPN also doesnt add to the instability, which I am using per default and had no instability issues. So my theory is, like I stated before, that it must be a process which is RAM related, whatever reason OpenVPN doesnt seem to be. But sleep, uhtpd and tinyproxy seem to be. Let this sh script run for a week or two and look if it gives any page faults via dmesg.</p><p>/root/test.sh &amp;<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

					<p>@beginner67890 it wont show anything in syslog (logread). It will just show in dmesg something like:</p><p>[Dec22 15:53] swap_free: Bad swap file entry 00000c00<br />[&nbsp; +0.005019] BUG: Bad page map in process sleep&nbsp; pte:00060000 pmd:1bd74831 (or grep) </p><p>And 30 is way too short. I had the first bug result after maybe a few days (7-12 days), and then a reboot between that time or a little bit later. It seems to me, that the script will allocate a little bit of RAM everytime the loop runs, and everytime, there is a little chance it will result in a page fault. I could reproduce this now three times over 2 months of using the unit. Same with uhttpd (opening luci, I had two crashes the moment I opened luci, maybe out of 200 times, same with using tinyproxy, using it daily maybe 30 times, I had two crashes using it in a month window. Yes, the eth1 is wrong in there, I just replaced it because mine is tun0 for checking the OpenVPN connection, and I just simplified the script of course for test reasons only. I am also wondering why it says &quot;Bad swap file entry&quot; where the units dont have a swap file enabled.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makedir</strong> on 17 Jan 2018, 17:51)</p>

					<p>makedir-</p><p>There could be a memory leak or something hogging the memory. The kernel must have the swap enabled and maybe wants to try a swap and finds there is no good swap found. I wonder if there is a kernel parameter to disable the swapping. I have heard about swapiness as an alternative. I am also curious if the sleep 5 calls the busybox sleep from the ash shell.</p><p>The test.sh is still running with no escalation of the process numbers so that was maybe a false alarm.

That version was from just before the change to remove the RTC support from the kernel. I only have the WRT1200AC version and could post that someplace if needed except that version doesn&#039;t have the krack protection if memory serves. I wonder if some of the problems might have started around the time of those changes.</p>									</div>
