					<p>Martin&#039;s right.</p><p>You can do *anything* with OpenWrt ! Except bash.org top #2... but we&#039;ve got people (probably [mbm] in secret) working on that.</p><p>The wiki has a GREAT WEALTH of information. Howto&#039;s, docs, and almost anything you wanted to know. The forums and IRC logs supplement that, and fill in gaps in the wiki.</p><p>However, you should have basic knowledge of Linux&nbsp; before using OpenWrt. If you&#039;ve never heard of &quot;vi&quot;, then it&#039;s probably not for you.</p><p>nbd&#039;s web interface is really very good, but if that&#039;s the only part of OpenWrt you use, you&#039;re losing a lot. nbd&#039;s qosfw script (traffic shaping) has to be manually configured, I believe. That&#039;s vi. No nano/pico for WhiteRussian!</p><p>So, if you&#039;re willing to learn, gopher it! But, know what you&#039;re doing.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p> - Yasha</p>									</div>
