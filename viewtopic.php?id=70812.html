					<p>Hello everybody. I am bad in English and totally new in network and Linux, sorry for this.<br />I explain my problem : I travel a lot for work and I want to connect my professional notebook in different hotels. <br />I don&#039;t have any administration rights on my professional notebook and I have to be connect by wire and my ip adress have to be supplied by a dhcp server.<br />In most off hotels, only Wi-Fi is available and with a captive portal, so I have bought the Hooton tm-02 to bridge the WiFi to the wire.<br />The official firmware doesn&#039;t allow to affect the ethernet port as LAN, so I have installed openwrt with luci with the help off your wiki, thank you.<br />But I tried during 3 full days to make works this without success...<br />The openwrt version is 15.05.1 I only use luci due to my lack of Linux competence. <br />In luci interface, the lan connexion seems to be good, the wwan connexion seems to good too. But I can&#039;t access to Google from my notebook. I am sure the WiFi is good because I am able to access to internet directly with my tablet. <br />I have tried to bridge the wwan and with lots off different ways but never with success. <br />Someone can help me ?<br />Thanks in advance, <br />Dimitry</p>									</div>

					<p>Make sure your WWAN interface is not a bridge.&nbsp; It should only have the wifi client attached to it.<br />Set the WWAN as DHCP client, so it gets an address from the wifi network.<br />-- make sure this address is in a <strong>different</strong> subnet than the LAN.<br />Set the WWAN firewall zone to be WAN.</p>									</div>
