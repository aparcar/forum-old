					<p>Hello.<br />I&#039;ve firmwared OpenWRT on my TP-Link and changed a password as I was prompted. Now the router doesn&#039;t give ip to computer so I can&#039;t load web-interface or ssh. It only gets a wrong ip like 169.254.x.x. What should I do now?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MrT</strong> on 3 May 2013, 12:04)</p>

					<p>When you first install Openwrt the lan interface is configured as 192.168.1.1/24.<br />I suspect thata you are using a machine that is expecting DHCP on its network interface.</p><p>If you are running windows, you will find and need to open the &quot;Local Area Connection Properties&quot; find the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) entry select it <br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://filelink.klam.ca/LAN-Props.JPG" alt="http://filelink.klam.ca/LAN-Props.JPG" /></span><br />Which should bring you to this -<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://filelink.klam.ca/TCP-Props.JPG" alt="http://filelink.klam.ca/TCP-Props.JPG" /></span><br />select &quot;use the following IP address, <br />enter 192.168.1.5 in &quot;IP address&quot;,<br />Accept the deafult &quot;Subnet Mask&quot;,<br />enter 192.168.1.1 as Default gateway. <br />Click on OK. You should now be able to access your router on 192.168.1.1.</p><p>Once you have configured the router <strong>do not forget</strong> to repeat the above process <strong>EXCEPT</strong> this time select &quot;Obtain an IP address automatically&quot;.</p><p>Good Luck.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zzz2002</strong> on 3 May 2013, 13:09)</p>

					<p>Thank you for reply, I&#039;ve tried many variants like this, but it only gives my computer an ip, but the router still remains hidden. No default gateway, no ip for the router. Seems like DHCP on router crashed or work not as intented.</p><p>Though I&#039;ve managed to solve the problem with safeload, telnet on 192.168.1.1 and firstboot command.</p>									</div>

					<p>169.254.XXX.XXX is the automatic prrivate ip range, this address will be randomly chosen as there is no DHCP server visible or no manual config is pressent.</p><p>Have you done anything more then changing the password?<br />Do other computers still connect fine to the router?</p><p>If all else fails you can try safemode and restore the router to default settings.<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe</a></p>									</div>
