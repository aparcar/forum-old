					<p>I posted these questions on the DD-WRT forum a week 4 days ago and no one can help, so I will ask here.</p><p>If there is a version of OpenWrt that will solve my problem described below, I would be happy to know about it as well.</p><p>I picked up a Rosewill (Newegg) RNX-N300RT. The hardware is identical to the TP-Link TL-WR841N V?. It uses an atheros chip.</p><p>I flashed it with this firmware: »ftp://dd-wrt.com/others/eko/BrainSlaye···P2/2012/</p><p>I followed the wiki Client Bridge instructions: »www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Client_Bridged</p><p>to set up a bridge with my WRT-54GL as the primary router (running V24 sp2).</p><p>I can get the N300 to maybe connect once after finishing the wiki instructions. After that, it does not work. I am seeing a lot of receive errors on the N300 status.</p><p>HOWEVER, »www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.···9#702019<br />describes using &quot;CLIENT MODE&quot; for the TP-Link TL-WR841N V7 which is the brother unit of the Rosewill, but I&#039;m not sure if the Rosewill RNX-N300RT hardware matches the TL-WR841N V7 or V8.</p><p>»www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Bridging<br />says that Client Bridging is better than Client Mode, BUT SAYS that Client Bridge DOES NOT WORK with Atheros chips.</p><p>So is this telling me why I can&#039;t get client bridging to work?</p><p>And client mode should work?</p><p>TO FURTHER muddy things, I read somewhere that if the host router is Broadcom based that it will not communicate well with an Atheros based client.</p><p>Can anyone shed some light on Client Bridging/Client Mode with Atheros wireless routers?</p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>
