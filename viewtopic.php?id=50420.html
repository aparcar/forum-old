					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have a TP-Link TL-WR703N, that is connected through Ethernet cable to the &quot;main&quot; router. The &quot;main&quot; router does not have WiFi, and I want to connect a Linux laptop with WiFi to the Internet. That&#039;s all.<br />I have followed the bridged AP on the wiki, and from Linux laptop connected to the TP-Link through WiFi (static IP), I can ssh to the TP-Link by:<br />ssh root@192.168.1.32</p><p>I can also connect from the TP-Link to the linux machine: ssh user@192.168.1.100</p><p>However, the Linux machine cannot connect to the Internet. Your help is greatly appreciated, and below are my config files.<br />Thanks,<br />Kian</p><p>network:</p>									</div>
