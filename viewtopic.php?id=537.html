					<p>Hi, </p><p>my ISP uses dhcp to spread the network config,<br />and then uses pptp to get the real connection.</p><p>The pptp client is rewriting the default gw, which is correct. But the dhcp-client every several hours adds the old default gw. So then there are 2 default gateways, and my connection hangs.</p><p>Is there a simple method of telling the dhcp-client not to add the default gw on a &quot;renew&quot; ? I searched the system a bit, but i haven&#039;t found the point where the dhcp-client is started. If I am able to alter the execution it should be simple to write an dhcp-event script, which corrects the route.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, this script (/usr/share/udhcpc/default.script) is the culprit in preventing pptp (and I would suspect any pppd based setup where the default route is replaced) from working &#039;out of the box&#039;.&nbsp; As it is currently, the script adds a default route when the dhcp lease is renewed, even if one already exists which is going through a different interface.&nbsp; I have modified the script to deal with the problem, and believe it is ok.&nbsp; Below is my patch.&nbsp; Comments are welcome.&nbsp; Specifically, is this modified script general enough that it won&#039;t cause problems with other setups, or is it only something which should be used in conjunction with pptp/pppd?</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>24,27c24,30
