					<p>Here&#039;s a description of what I&#039;d like to do with my router.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure it should be possible, but have no idea how.</p><p>* On the single WAN port get 2 IP addresses. (I&#039;m allowed 5 by my connection.)<br />* Configure the DHCP server as follows:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;* Assign LAN computers on 172.18.0.0/255.255.255.0 (1 week lease).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;* Assign wireless computers on 172.18.1.0/255.255.255.0 (6 hr lease).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;* Allow communication by all computers throughout the 172.18.0.0/255.255.254.0 subnet.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;* Always give certain clients specific IP addresses (I know the stock firmware could do this.&nbsp; I do have reasons for not statically setting them on the clients.)<br />* Forward all requests on the second WAN address to 172.18.0.2.&nbsp; (Yes, it has its own firewall.)<br />* Use updatedd to assign a separate DynDNS address to each external IP.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, that seems simple enough that way.&nbsp; Plus, I figured out how to do the iptables to do the forwarding.&nbsp; After further research, my DHCP question is down to what goes where &quot;red&quot; is in &quot;dhcp-range=red,192.168.0.50,192.168.0.150&quot;?&nbsp; Is it just the interface name, or do I need something else?&nbsp; I still have no clue on how to get multiple IP addresses from a single WAN port.</p>									</div>
