					<p>I will try to keep this as concise as possible.<br />I am trying to get all my v4 traffic through a vpn for ports 1-400, since I do not want games going through it.</p><p>now I have openvpn installed and I have it connect fine to tun0</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# ping -I tun0 google.com

If I swap that instead of going through the vpn, but one of the other models like WAN3, it works fine...</p><br /><p>So I tried to use openwrt&#039;s built in firewall rules except that doesn&#039;t work for anything</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=225899#p225899">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 99#p225899</a></p><p>What gives? <br />Help please ;(</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jigglywiggly</strong> on 21 Feb 2014, 05:03)</p>

					<p>I would be interested in that as well, though I want to route only specific clients through the VPN,not ports. Anyone?<br />Also, have you tried MultiWAN, it looks like it can do the trick:</p><p><a href="http://router-firmware-test.gamma.nu/LuCI/network/multiwan/index.html">http://router-firmware-test.gamma.nu/Lu … index.html</a><br />(look at the routing parameters at the bottom)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>grouper</strong> on 13 Mar 2014, 17:30)</p>

					<p>What is the output of route command? Remember each WAN interface needs to have default route created with weight. For example something like</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>default         84.16.xx.xx     0.0.0.0         UG    10     0        0 pppoe-wan
default         192.168.1.1     0.0.0.0         UG    20     0        0 eth0.2</code></pre></div><p>for my 2 wan interfaces.<br />If you don&#039;t see an item like that for your tun0 interface it will not work. At worse you could create a script and define such route manually when you run vpn.</p>									</div>
