					<p>Hi.<br />I set up an ipsec-tunnel (CHAOS CALMER (15.05, r46767)). It works fine as long as the firewall is stopped.<br />I configured it in /etc/racoon.conf, because the /etc/config/racoon method did not work (had no time to debug).<br />Now I do not know how to connect the zone vpn in /etc/config/network to the ipsec-Tunnel so I can just add that zone to the lan firewall interface. All traffic from lan to tunnel is allowed.<br />If you use the /etc/config/racoon method, there is a possibility to connect VPN to ipsec.<br />But how do I do that in /etc/racoon.conf or /etc/config/network<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Racoon IPsec Configuration
