					<p>Hi to all,<br />I hope to be in the correct place to write to.<br />I built my own attitude adjustment from source but I&#039;m unable to have the func_cdr.so asterisk module included in the build by default. It is missing from the menu select system but it is compiled and i can copy it to the router manually after i have flashed the image... Do you have any suggestion on how it will be possible... I&#039;m not a skilled coder...<br />Thank you<br />Bye<br />Marcello</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>I will provide a patch for asterisk18 and fix it in trunk. You can try asterisk11 in current trunk which has cdr already working.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Slachta,<br />thank you for the patch, I will wait for it.<br />I will try asterisk11 in future but i think I will not use in the future because right now I&#039;m at the limit of space in the flash image for my routers and for sure asterisk11 will take more space on it.<br />Will asterisk 1.8 remain as available packages to choose from? I mean there will way to select which asterisk to build from make menuconfig in future ot asterisk11 will become the only one?</p><p>Thank you<br />Bye<br />Marcello</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello Marcello,</p><p>current trunk should now have asterisk18-cdr repaired. Try it out. And asterisk18 will remain as available package. At this time you can choose which asterisk to build. And no, asterisk11 won&#039;t be the only one - thats why I keep also older versions of kamailio package (due to memory requirements and existing systems based on it).</p><p>Jiri</p>									</div>
