					<p>Hello,</p><p>I just bought myself a shiny new MR3020. On the&nbsp; wiki page for this nice piece of equipment the usage of Attitude Adjustment RC1 is advised. On the other hand there is already RC2 available for quite some time. Any advice from people currently using the MR3020?</p>									</div>

					<p>The wiki is outdated. You can use the final version (just remove the RC1 from the URL).</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s impossible to keep the wiki up-to-date since every now and then funny people show up and barf in stuff without thinking about keeping the wiki up-to-date ;-)</p><p>Please refer to <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/about/latest">OpenWrt - Current Stable Release</a>, it tells us: <strong>r36088</strong> and also <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/about/history#timeline">OpenWrt Releases - Timeline</a>. I think the picture is obtained from TurtleSVN, is there a similar tool for Debian to get such a visual?</p><p>So if the wiki says something like <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-mr3020#supported.versions">Supported Versions: r32786</a> you can safely assume it is supported in later stable releases. The proof would be an installable firmware image on the download server ;-)</p><p>I am not quite sure why people think, they have to confirm working images. <br />Unix: if the programs <strong>says nothing, that means = it is ok, it works</strong>. If it was broken, there should be bug reports/notification in the forum (=not a bug report).</p><p>The stupid stupid stupid thing about such superfluous confirms is that newbies get doubts. Oh, no, there is no confirm, does it really work? Really really? Really really really? Stupid.........!</p>									</div>

					<p>BTW, as you can read here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-features">TP-Link naming scheme</a>, minor numbers should mean no changes in the hardware at all. The bootloader could be different, so one must be cautious when installing, yet the hardware should be identical. That is TP-Link. D-Link on the other hand, does it differently.</p>									</div>
