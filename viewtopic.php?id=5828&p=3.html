MAC address setup fixed based on NSLU2 code.<br />* I2C: Ok based on NSLU2 sources (GPIO&#039;s are 12/SDA and 13/SCL)<br />* RTC: Ok with single line patch to fix typo on original driver. Driver was posted to LKML couple weeks ago.<br />* FAN control and sensors: Ok with stock 2.6.16 drivers. lm-sensors report sensible values and I can control fan RPM thru pwm1 (0-255).<br />* Buttons: Not tested. I have made list of GPIO&#039;s and there&#039;s code I can copy from NSLU2 patches.<br />* Mini-PCI: Not tested. WLAN card on Mini-PCI slot detected, but haven&#039;t tried with drivers yet.<br />* LEDs: Not working, connected to IXP4XX_EXP_BUS_CS2. Seems led driver included with kernel doesn&#039;t support it yet (only GPIO leds). There&#039;s &quot;ledman&quot; from Snapgear for 2.6 that Freecom uses with 2.4 kernel, but I&#039;d rather used standard interface.<br />* HW Crypto: Not tested.

As it&#039;s configured 3 port LAN switch + 1 port WAN at bootup unless you hack RedBoot to configure it differently there&#039;s no much use for such tool. Otherwise those two networks will be bridged together until your userspace tool configures it differently.</p><p>If I understood correctly newest firmware from Freecom has option to turn WAN port to 4th LAN port. This is exactly opposite what you&#039;re trying to do, but you might want to check how they implemented it. Either switch is reconfigured and secondary ethernet port is disabled or they&#039;re bridging both ethernet interfaces together on OS side.</p><p>There&#039;s tool to configure RTL8305SB/RTL8309SB switch from Linux, but haven&#039;t found sources for it. It&#039;s included in firmware of some SnapGear VPN devices and Billion BiGuard 2/5/10. Both platforms are bigendian XScales so you might be able to re-use it with FSG in armeb mode. However both binary compatibility and licensing are issues. SnapGear sources are available, but apparently this tool isn&#039;t GPL licensed by them. Billion is OpenRG based. Good luck trying to get Billion to release any sources and honor GPL - they just couldn&#039;t care less.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sounds like you only have patches I uploaded my site some time ago. Those don&#039;t contain I2C parts nor reading ethernet mac from flash. You can copy+paste them from any IXP4XX platform and just change GPIOs + flash offsets. I published necessary GPIOs somewhere. Wiki, this forum, OpenFSG or something can&#039;t remember. As I wrote on email I sent to you about week ago I&#039;m leaving for vacation (4 weeks) and don&#039;t have time to play with FSG nor WL700 at the moment.</p>									</div>
