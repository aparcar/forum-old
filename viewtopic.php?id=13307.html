					<p>My home network is setup in a fairly standard way: a bunch of machines on a LAN connected to an (OpenWRT) WRTSL54GS Linksys router doing a PPPoE connection over a DSL line via a DSL modem.<br />Now, my DSL modem provides some useful web pages to get DSL statistics and configuration and I&#039;d like to be able to access it from any machine on the LAN.</p><p>So let&#039;s say my LAN uses 192.168.1.NN addresses and I&#039;ve setup my DSL modem to use IP address 192.168.2.3 (it&#039;s on another network, obviously, connected to the WAN port of the router).</p><p>On the router I did &quot;ifconfig eth1 192.168.2.4&quot; which gives an IP address to my WAN connection and sets up a route, so I can now connect to my modem from my router.&nbsp; This works fine.</p><p>But when trying to connect from other machines on my LAN, this doesn&#039;t work: presumably the packets do go to the router (thanks to the defaultrule) and then from there to modem, but the modem doesn&#039;t know how to reply to 192.168.1.XX.&nbsp; Maybe I could try and setup a route on my modem to access the 192.168.1.XX network via my router, but I&#039;m not sure how I could do that (sadly this DSL box isn&#039;t running OpenWRT), so another option is to use NAT.</p><p>I tried &quot;iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth1 -j SNAT --to-source 192.168.2.4&quot; but it doesn&#039;t seem to do what I want.&nbsp; Could someone help me out?</p>									</div>

					<p>The snat should be working, that is how I have mine setup.&nbsp; You can check outgoing packets on eth1 with tcpdump.&nbsp; you might also want to limit what source packets can use this rule. PLus because its a -A it append to the end of the table, check what is before this rule.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks.&nbsp; I finally figured it out: it turns out that the problem was in the FORWARD: it only allows forwarding from br0 to br0 and from $LAN to $WAN (where $LAN is br0 and $WAN is the ppp0), but not from $LAN to $WANDEV (the eth1 on which is connected my modem).<br />Makes me curious: why allow br0-&gt;br0 and $LAN-&gt;$WAN?<br />I&#039;d have expected a rule that allows from $LAN to anywhere.<br />(tho maybe it&#039;s different in kamikaze: I&#039;m still on whiterussian here).</p>									</div>
