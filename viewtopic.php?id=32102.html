					<p>Hi! First of all, sorry for my worst english,<br />i&#039;ll try to explain my question as clearly as possible: I&#039;ve got one moudem router (red square in the <br />picture) where some clients are connected. Now i would like to extend the signal of this router (so in this configuration there&#039;s no wired connection, all wireless) and it should act as dhcp simultaneously.<br />Example:</p><p>Router 1 is 192.168.1.1 and has DHCP enabled.<br />There are connected Ann on 192.168.1.2 and John on 192.168.1.3 to Router 1<br />My repeater is connected as REPEATER using 192.168.1.100 and DHCP enabled, too. From now, the repeater should act as a wireless access point, so it will give to Frank 192.168.1.101 and Jack 192.168.1.102. The ip(s) of Frank and John are not visible to Router 1 (right?), because Repeater will do the job through 192.168.1.100.<br />Is this possible to configure my network in this way? How is it named?<br />Thank you, hope you can help <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Angelo</p><p>p.s: NO wiired connection, only wireless!</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JE8fm.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/JE8fm.jpg" /></span></p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry for poor information, you are right. <br />1) Router 1 is NOT running openwrt, Repeater IS RUNNING openwrt.</p><p>2) I want two DHCP because my ISP gave me a Router that can assign only 3 ip, so a maximum of 3 computer can use internet. Don&#039;t ask why, but there&#039;s no way to bypass the problem (you cannot replace the router given from ISP etc etc, see FASTWEB). The only way is to issue one of the 3 ip so more thank 3 computers can use internet.</p><p>3) I repeat that there&#039;s no way to use WIRED connections, only Wireless.</p><p>I think that this should be correct:<br />Repeater - A wireless repeater with DHCP &amp; NAT enabled, clients on different subnet from host AP (primary router). Computers connected to one router can not see computers connected to other routers in Windows Network. </p><p>I don&#039;t know if the subnet thingy will cause some problems, because Fastweb gives local ip like 10.xxx.xxx.xxx<br />Based on the technique called Network Address Translation (NAT), the Fastweb network is constructed as a sort of giant local area network (LAN, Local Area Network) on a metropolitan scale, MAN (Metropolitan Area Network). Fastweb users are, thus, in a sense, part of one big shared users, connected to the global network, that many users have the same area, from the outside, a single IP address. Users can request a &quot;public IP address&quot; (ie assigned to a single user) for a few hours a month free or pay for longer service. (from wiki)</p><p>Thank you!</p>									</div>

					<p>If it can help, my Repeater should work like a common access point that, connected to the lan of the Modem-Router, will work in dhcp. I would like to do the same thing, but no wired connection to the lan port, only wireless. That&#039;s all!</p>									</div>

					<p>i agree i would use 2 subnets... router A 192.168.1.xxx running DHCP server on LAN interface, router B openWRT should use DHCP client on WAN interface to router A, and have LAN interface as new subnet say 192.168.2.xxx running DHCP server.</p>									</div>
