					<p>Hello all I am new to openwrt. I was in LuCi and deleted all the interfaces including lan, in an attempt to set up my wireless router. I can no longer log into 192.168.1.1 using my browser. I have googled answers and come across the failsafe mode on this site. I have done to steps to put the router in failsafe mode (fast blinking sys led). what command line program in windows 7 am i supposed to be using? In windows command I telnet 192.168.1.1 and get message &quot;could not open connection to host on port 23, connection failed.&quot; what am i doing wrong or what should i do?</p>									</div>
