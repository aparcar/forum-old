					<p>Hi guys!</p><p>I have a raspberry pi connected via lan cable on one port of the switch on the back of my router. Now the problem is, on the stock firmware, I can ping and access my raspberry pi(connected at switch with lan cable) from my PC which is connected to the router via wlan. But when I use openwrt, I can&#039;t ping or access the raspberry pi.<br />Please help me in setting up my openwrt setup so that I can <strong>access clients on the switch from wlan</strong>.</p><p>I am new to openwrt and still learning the basics. I like it very much and don&#039;t want to go back to stock firmware.</p><p>Kindly help me guys!</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
