					<p>That sounds about right.</p><p>It depends on the rated speed of your USB drive. Most cheap drives will average 2 to 5 megabytes per second. If you spend a little more you can get faster rated sticks that can reach up to 10 or 15 megs a second.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, AFAIK your download speed is not limited by the used usb-Stick but by your cpu.<br />My wl-500gd with 200Mhz can only handle around 1,8MB per second with 100% CPU usage (normally is&#039;t around 0% ^^) </p><p>with best regards</p><p>p90</p>									</div>

					<p>So, the limitation is from the CPU. Last night I ran some test and I found out that the raw data rate of my USB stick is ~8MB/s, I used:</p><p>time cp file.big /dev/null</p><p>and the CPU usage was ~40% (the kernel module was using &gt;35%). But when I try to transfer data over the network I get 90% CPU usage. With only ~5-10% by the kernel module, so the 90% of the processor is used by the transfer protocol (Samba/NFS or vsftp), probably with non DMA memory copy operations (reading from drive then writing to eth) and IP encapsulation.<br />So the solution is to use a low overhead protocol, but which one?<br />Maybe TFTP?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Ovydake</strong> on 22 Sep 2007, 11:53)</p>
