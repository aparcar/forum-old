					<p>I&#039;m still working on it. Currently the fvmac.ko binary blob for the original kernel will not initialize the ethernet ports properly. I&#039;m working on getting it to work, as well as get the specs from 5V Technologies for the cpu so I can write up a proper driver, then it&#039;s just a matter of waiting for the rt2x00 group to port their driver for the rt2680 wireless card, which is projected to be stable in v2.0. So, in other words, it&#039;s not supported as of yet.</p><p>Jeff</p><p>FYI, the ar525w is supported by the RDC branch (I&#039;ve got it running on mine)</p>									</div>

					<p>There&#039;s u-boot with fvmac sourcecode included in Edimax BR-6504n GPL tarball if that&#039;s any help for developing Linux driver. U-boot fvmac driver apperas to be licensed GPL v2. Same package also includes kernel sources for those six arch files that Airlink ships in binary form. </p><p><a href="http://www.edimax.eu/images/Image/OpenSourceCode/Wireless/Router/BR-6504n/BR-6504n_GPL.zip">http://www.edimax.eu/images/Image/OpenS … 4n_GPL.zip</a></p><p>It seems Ralink RT1310A is another name used for this CPU. So if you manage to find sources for Buffalo WZR2-G300N, Belkin F5D8231-4 ver3000 or SparkLAN WRTR-501 they might be useful. BTW. All these routers have very similar firmware headers but only Edimax is clear eg. it&#039;s just compressed using bzip2. Others use some sort of obfuscation but original bzip2 header is still easy to spot on hexdump.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jr</strong> on 7 May 2008, 19:29)</p>
