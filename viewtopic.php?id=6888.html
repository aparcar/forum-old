					<p>Hi</p><p>Can we know the name of this mystery AP?</p><p>What you are asking here is basically impossible using Linux. The bootloader is 192k, the kernel is ~600-700 k which leaves at best just over 128k for everything else. The support files to make openwrt work wouldn&#039;t fit in that space, let alone any binaries or drivers. I would suggest you find a device with at least 2Mb of flash (4 - 8 Mb of flash would be sensible).</p><p>FYI Atheros 2313 is the CPU and Radio, and the Marvell 88E6060 is an ethernet switch.</p>									</div>

					<p>Interesting....</p><p>What&#039;s the chance of booting the 1M router with a tiny kernel which will do little but boot the router, then create some sort of remote internet|network based filesystem, akin to NFS booting on typical embedded clients?</p><p>The micro-firmware would need to be pre-configured in the &quot;make menuconfig&quot; with parameters such as the URL to the filesystem on the internet or network, and the type of authentication - such as pre-shared keys. Any boot or local build-scripts would be kept locally in RAM and loaded from the network, with clean-up running dynamically. </p><p>As to which type of &quot;filesystem&quot; or method of access, I wouldn&#039;t be able to hazard a guess.</p><p>That&#039;s the only way I can think of running these routers with minsicule flash RAM.</p><br /><p>C.</p>									</div>

					<p>We consider 2MB devices small and now we are thinking about 1MB? With the 2MB devices difficult as is, 1MB would prove to be a challenge. But with a SD card mod, all we need is a secondary bootloader! In 1MB, there will be enough room for not only the secondary bootloader but also a simple command prompt GPIO debugging tool.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Telek,</p><p>This looks like a Marvell based SOC. No-one is working on that platform at the moment as far as I am aware.

					<p>The WL-530g firmware I&#039;ve been working on (Liberated Libertas I call it) is applicable here. </p><p>The WL-530g uses the same hardware as this, but has 4/16MB ROM/RAM.&nbsp; I have done much research on it and created uClinux based firmwares derived from the ASUS sources. For research, see <a href="http://www.bitsum.com/openwiking/owbase/ow.asp?WL-530G">http://www.bitsum.com/openwiking/owbase/ow.asp?WL-530G</a> .</p><p>The bottom line is that there is no MMU on this device, requiring uClinux and a host of special considerations (i.e. RAM management decisions totally different, no fork(), etc..). You can develop a uClinux based firmware for this device using the sources I&#039;ve hosted at berlios (see link above),&nbsp; but you&#039;ll have to work hard to get it to run within the constraints of this device&#039;s ROM and RAM.</p><p>To clarify, no OpenWrt branch to date supports uClinux and devices without an MMU. I might work towards this sometime eventually, but I&#039;m fairly content with the uClinux buildroot.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>db90h</strong> on 10 Oct 2006, 10:50)</p>
