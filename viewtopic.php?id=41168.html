					<p>Pretty self explanatory in the description. I&#039;ve been unable to fix this though, even through failsafe. Without failsafe, there is no gateway and I can&#039;t connect to the router. In failsafe I can get in through the default 192.168.1.1 but anything I try within that doesn&#039;t work. I have tried the following:</p><p>wget - Tells me &quot;bad address &#039;<a href="http://www.whatever.com">www.whatever.com</a>&#039;&quot;<br />tftp programs through windows that timeout<br />tftp through linux on vmware that timeout<br />mtd -r erase rootfs_data which outputs &quot;could not open mtd device rootfs_data&quot;</p><p>I was originally running the latest attitude adjustment and this is a wrt160nl.</p><p>I haven&#039;t tried a serial connection because it just seems like I shouldn&#039;t have to if I can access failsafe. </p><p>Thanks in advance for any time you put toward this.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>projekt8e</strong> on 19 Dec 2012, 11:31)</p>

					<p>Yes. I have never used the more difficult jffs2 version, so I have always been able to revert to defaults pretty easily with the squashfs version. Most of the recovery advice is targeted for the squashfs version as &quot;everybody&quot; uses it.</p><p>I think that you should be able to edit the config files in the failsafe mode with a text editor (vi, nano, whatever you have installed). Or you could manipulate them with the uci commands. They are just normal text files in /etc/config.<br />Check from the source code, what are the defaults for /etc/config/network and /etc/config/dhcp</p><p>You should also be able to cat the contents of those two files and post them here, so that others could help you in spotting config errors.</p><p>Based on this <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/target/linux/ar71xx/base-files/etc/uci-defaults/network#L143">https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/t … twork#L143</a> , you should have this in /etc/config/network for lan &amp; wan:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface lan

					<p>Thanks for your help hnyman, I feel like I am getting somewhat closer. I have managed to edit my network file with vi, but the only hang up now is that it won&#039;t save. At first it was stuck in read only, so then I used mount_root and went back to the network file to find it was now saying &#039;modified&#039;. Unfortunately I still can&#039;t get it to save these settings. </p><p>Basically, after I enter the changes is hit &#039;esc&#039; to exit the editing mode, and then &#039;w&#039; to write it and when I hit &#039;q&#039; is says &#039;q is not implemented&#039;.</p><p>That is where I am stuck at the moment.</p>									</div>
