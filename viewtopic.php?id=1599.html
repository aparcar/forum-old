					<p>Ok, I got the WRT54G v.3 from circuit city, $40 after rebates..</p><p>I know it&#039;s listed on the ToH as experimental, is it pretty stable or not?</p><p>Currently my dad has version 1.1 or 1.0, so I could just swap them, he&#039;d never know..</p><p>Is there any problem with unplugging this thing after openwrt is on it?&nbsp; I mean, it&#039;s not necessary to telnet in, and do &#039;shutdown -h now&#039; or anything like that right?</p><p>It&#039;s all flash memory and circuit board, so I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s safe to just power down..</p>									</div>
