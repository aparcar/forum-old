					<p>As you post factory bin file only once and coming from stock, now in future you are going to use sysupgrade bin for updates, I don&#039;t use BB but in AA is System/Back Up/Flash Firmware/Flash new firmware image keep settings is check it&#039;s up to you to live it or uncheck it, if that&#039;s not the way in BB correct my post.<br />I remember reading&nbsp; barrier_breaker/14.07-rc3/ comes with LuCi</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>danymarc</strong> on 14 Sep 2014, 18:26)</p>

					<p>Please bear with. What do you mean by AA?&nbsp; I used the latest BB factory bin file initially. Are you saying that I simply go into LuCi and flash with the latest BB sysupdate image to keep it updated?&nbsp; Does this also update LuCi at the same time when I do this?&nbsp; Thanks for the help.</p>									</div>

					<p>Don&#039;t get confuse <br />BB is Barrier Braker the one you flashed and it&#039;s the newest one i assume you downloaded barrier_breaker/14.07-rc3 latest release<br />AA is attitude adjustment and old build <br />Don&#039;t worry about updates for now if you loaded barrier_breaker/14.07-rc3 you have latest</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes I did load RC 3 of BB. I had to separately install LuCi. What I am asking is when the next version of BB is available, how do I install it?&nbsp; Second it appears that LuCi is not combined with BB; so then how do I update it?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Barrier breaker starting with rc3 has luci built in. Any future updates to BB can be downloaded from openwrt.org. Use the &quot;sysupgrade&quot; file. Luci will be included in that upgrade and you&#039;ll only need to reinstall any other packages you previously installed. The version will match with the version of BB you download.</p>									</div>
