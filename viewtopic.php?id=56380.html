					<p>Hello everybody,<br />I have just installed Barrier Breaker&nbsp; 14.07 on a TP-Link WDR3600 router. I am trying to set the txpower of the two wireless interfaces on this router (phy0 for the 2.4 Ghz and phy1 for the 5 Ghz) with no success.</p><p>I have tried to use these commands from the cli:</p><p>iw reg set BO<br />iw phy phy0 set txpower fixed 20000</p><p>but when I log in with Luci what I see from the web interface is that only for phy1 the country is set to BO, while for phy0 it is still US, and when I enable phy0 the Tx-Power value reported in the status field is always 18 dBm.</p><p>So is Luci reporting incorrect values, or am I doing something wrong.<br />Any help would be appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, I have applied the patch, I have set the option txpower &#039;20&#039; in /etc/config/wireless, but then, besides Luci, whose reliability I understand is not certain, also iwinfo still gives me tx-power&nbsp; to 18 dBm:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# iwinfo

					<p>I reopen this thread because now I am having issues with the 5Ghz txpower settings.<br />To do some tests, I have switched to DE regulatory domain, and I have applied reghack patch, which gives me this channels available:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Frequencies:
            * 5180 MHz [36] (20.0 dBm)
            * 5200 MHz [40] (20.0 dBm)
            * 5220 MHz [44] (20.0 dBm)
            * 5240 MHz [48] (20.0 dBm)</code></pre></div><p>So I could set txpower to 20 dBm for these channels<br />However, regardless of which method I set the txpower (that is, using LUCI or shell), what I always get is txpower set to 15 dBm:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>wlan1     ESSID: &quot;OpenWrt5&quot;
          Access Point: XXXXXXXXXXXX
          Mode: Master  Channel: 36 (5.180 GHz)
