					<p>I&#039;m trying to implement a very basic captive portal for Wifi connections on my OpenWrt router. Each time a new client connects, an iptables entry is inserted into /etc/firewall.user for that client as follows:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -s xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -p tcp -j REDIRECT --to-ports 1234</p><p>I am running a web server on port 1234 (uhttpd) and I have a simple php script, which displays the login form and authenticates the user. If the user is successfully authenticated, the iptables entry for his device gets removed and the firewall is restarted. The issue I am facing is that after the entry has been removed and firewall has been restarted, browsing seems to not work for a certain period, which means an automatic redirect to the original page does not work (it initiates, but hangs indefinitely). Sometimes a refresh fixes this issue, sometimes not and it takes longer; it&#039;s random.</p><p>The second thing I tried was directly running iptables commands from my script instead of inserting them into /etc/firewall.user. In addition to the previously mentioned command I used:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -s xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -p tcp -j REDIRECT --to-ports 1234</p><p>for removing, but deleting this way takes even way longer to take effect.</p><p>I am wondering if anyone has any tips on how I could improve my implementation.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Try reversing the rules. <br/>Enforce redirection all the time.<br/>If an ip address clears your php, add a rule to bypass the redirection by simple using iptables -I ...<br/>-I will cause the rule to be inserted at the top and hence will bypass redirection<br/>once client is done or upon timeout, simply delete the rule.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your answer, but unfortunately it did not help. The firewall still has to be restarted, which leads to the same issue again - automatic redirect hangs after authentication.</p>									</div>
