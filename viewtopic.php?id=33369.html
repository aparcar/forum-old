					<p>Hello everybody!</p><p>Again me with a strange question <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>But, I guess, there are some people, that like to discuss unussual questions. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>What I would like to do.<br />I want to plug a usb-controlled microscheme to a USB port of my router that is runing OpenWRT.<br />I want to use an open-source programm (I will have it soon) to run the device on the USB port.<br />And i want to have a remote-control web-gui on a PC, that is in the same network, that is my router.<br />Is not this explanation very messy? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>The solution I am thinking about is sharing the USB port through the network. Is that possible on OpenWRT?</p><p>One more thing: It is actually a virtual COM port. But it is allready supported by the linux kernel older then 2.6.31 (?)</p><p>Any ideas?</p><p>Thank you!</p>									</div>

					<p>The <a href="http://usbip.sourceforge.net/">USB/IP</a> project is what you&#039;re looking for.&nbsp; Nowever, I have no idea whether you can load a USB-serial driver on top of USB-IP virtual USB port.</p><p>Since OpenWrt already has USB and USB-serial drivers, can you split your open source program into two pieces?&nbsp; One piece running on OpenWrt, the other on your PC.</p>									</div>

					<p>My latest idea now is to make a daemon, that translates commands from IP port directly to the virtual COM-port (the usb device is actually a virtual com)<br />It seems to be more simply. But there I have some more questions and I would like to discuss them in a nearest topic here.</p><p>But still, if I would like to send the information from the usb-camera to the server - i will need to share my USB port.. Or to run another daemon on local router. I did not decided yet.</p>									</div>
