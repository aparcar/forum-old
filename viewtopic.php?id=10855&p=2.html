					<p>loadi624, is it actually working? i mean, do you see the prompt on the serial console, etc?<br />If it works, it looks like watchdog is enabled.<br />It seem to be disabled in startup code of redboot, but i&#039;m not sure now. It was way too long ago.</p>									</div>

					<p>yes i see prompt of redboot, if i work quickly i can execute some commands. Like version <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />And bad thing that i see code, wich is used for disabling watchdog. Can you tell me what version of redboot you use in your case? Maybe you can provide some sources or ready redboot rom?

					<p>I got a D-Link DI-624 rev. D2 (on label, D1 on board) with erased firmware - completely dead, only POWER, WAN and all LAN LEDs were on. Removed the SPI flash (MX25L1605) and connected to a SPI &quot;programmer&quot; (in fact, 4 resistors and parallel port - <a href="http://rayer.ic.cz/elektro/spipgm.htm">http://rayer.ic.cz/elektro/spipgm.htm</a> ). Dumped the flash and it was all FFs only.</p><p>So I downloaded a 1MB firmware that includes boot loader ( <a href="ftp://ftp.dlink.com/Gateway/di624_revD/Firmware/di624revD_firmware_404.bin">ftp://ftp.dlink.com/Gateway/di624_revD/ â€¦ re_404.bin</a> ) and flashed (to address 0 of the 2MB flash). This was not correct but allowed the boot loader to start and restore the firmware using web interface.</p><p>The router now booted but MAC addresses were 00:11:22:33:44:55 and 00:11:22:33:44:56. Found that the first MAC address is stored in the boot loader at offset 0x40 - so edited the firmware and reflashed again (using the programmer, the web interface will not change it). Now MAC addresses are OK.</p><p>But last problem remains: wifi does not work. The WLAN led is off and clicking on the wireless button in web interface does nothing. Found something that might be serial console at JP1 (lower pins from left: 3.3V, RX, NC, NC, TX, GND) but there&#039;s no output (probably disabled in firmware?). At least tftp can be used to get some files: dbgout.txt, ar5maco.dat and ar5eepo.dat.</p><p>dbgout.txt shows that there&#039;s a problem with WLAN EEPROM:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Created Inet main task.

					<p>Bought the same router in working order and dumped the flash. Changed MAC (at offset 0x40 - this should be set to the MAC from label minus 1) and flashed to the non-working one. Here&#039;s the file (changed MAC to 00:11:22:33:44:55, configuration deleted): <a href="http://www.rainbow-software.org/linux_files/d-link_di-624_rev_d/di-624_rev_d_full_dump.zip">http://www.rainbow-software.org/linux_f â€¦ l_dump.zip</a><br />It&#039;s some old firmware, update it to 4.04b47 after reviving the router.</p><p>MAC address from 0x40 is used for both LAN and WLAN.
