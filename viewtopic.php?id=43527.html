					<p>I am about to flash my TL-WR1043ND routeur with the Attitude Adjustment 12.09 version of openwrt. I am already running on backfire 10.03.01 on hardware v1.4 and i want to upgrade to the latest release as i understood support for ipv6 is better (specifically 6rd wich is offered by my isp).</p><p>i went&nbsp; through this for :http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd</p><p>i have a few questions (some hw specific, some openwrt specific, some might be stupid). </p><p>1. is attitude adjustment running ok&nbsp; for hardware version 1.0 to 1.7? I read some thread on this forum about people bricking the device, but i did not compile statistics about the hardware version of those. I guess the answer is yes because it is written on page below the list (see link at the begining): <br /> &quot;The list above shows the earliest OpenWRT release to be supported. Higher releases should be supported unless otherwise stated.&quot;</p><p>Nevertheless i just want to make sure. Can someone confirm it works for hardware v1.0 to v1.7?</p><p>2. what&#039;s the difference between version 12.09, 12.09-rc1 and 12.09-rc2 of attitude adjustement? Wich should i use for hw v1.0 to v1.7?&nbsp; &nbsp; obviously i would flash hardware v1.10 with rc1 but why? Does it mean i should not use rc1 for hw v1.0 to 1.7 Also i saw there is 2 different firmware images (v1 and v2) for 12.09-rc2. </p><p>3. To upgrade openwrt i deduced i must simply use in the *openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr1043nd-v1-jffs2-sysupgrade.bin<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; is this right?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Between the jffs2 and the SquashFS image in term of upgrade is the difference a simple as (i came to this conlusion looking at the flash layout):<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; -to upgrade the kernel i pick the *SquashFS-sysupgrade.bin file<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; -to upgrade the system i pick the *jffs2-sysupgrade.bin file<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; If that&#039;s not it and if i must use both is there as sequence in wich to use them?</p><p>Answers to those questions might be already written somewhere. As i do not want anyone spending time duplicating information, simple links to webpages can do it if i missed something...</p><p>Any help is really appreciated!</p><p>Cordiallly,</p>									</div>
