					<p>Been trying to get OpenConnect VPN to work with Cisco AnyConnect client.</p><p>Started with:<br />OpenConnect SERVER Setup Guide for Beginners</p><p>Specific configuration:<br />1)<br />My OpenWRT box is NOT the router in the network. It&#039;s just an access point. So I&#039;ve forwarded port 443 tcp/udp from router to the OpenWRT box.<br />Can&#039;t run OpenWRT on the router unfortunately (sitecom x4 n300).<br />2)<br />Added a route so that only the specific vpn network runs over the VPN.</p><p>Testing:<br />1)<br />Installed OpenConnect and mailed the certificate to the client. Installed certificate on client (Windows Phone using Cisco AnyConnect client).<br />2)<br />Client can connect to the vpn succesfully using name and password.</p><p>However client can&#039;t reach any ip on the vpn network. It does ping the openwrt box and the router but can&#039;t open their web pages.</p><p>It seems that I&#039;m missing some routing here. As the openwrt is not the router it does seem that I need to add more routing. </p><p>From System log I can see the user connection being built. <br />I tried adding the Ethernet Adapter vpns0 to interface LAN in Interfaces (Luci) to see if that would supply the correct routing but it didn&#039;t.</p><p>What am I missing in routing here?</p>									</div>
