					<p>Hello!</p><p>I just flashed my NETGEAR r6300v2 with OpenWrt 15.05 (the latest one that model supports according to the compatibility page), but when I go to &quot;Network --&gt; Wifi&quot; I only have a single adapter listed: &quot;Generic MAC80211 802.11bg (radio0)&quot;</p><p>Knowing that this is an AC-capable router, I was intrigued that it is listed as 802.11bg. Will this affect my Wifi speeds? If so, how can I get OpenWrt to recognize the other band in the router (since AC combines b/g with n, I presume it is for some reason not recognizing the n band part).</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br />--KSX</p>									</div>

					<p>ALSO (I&#039;m not sure if this is related):</p><p>I&#039;m sitting next to my router and my broadcast strength is 0%. I cannot connect to the wireless network, either (obviously) on any devices. Also, I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s supposed to be, but the wireless indicator light on the router itself is not on.</p>									</div>

					<p>@KnightShadeX can you share how you compiled and flashed firmware? Any extra steps. I too want to know why 5GHz band is not working and 11AC is blocked?</p>									</div>

					<p>I used NETGEAR&#039;s built-in GUI. Went to &quot;Upgrade Router&quot; and pointed it at the 15.05 file for the firmware upgrade. When it finished flashing the new firmware, I only had the bg interface.</p>									</div>
