					<p>Hi there, after hours of searching guides as well as unsuccessfull experiments I&#039;m turning to the forum hoping for good information:<br />I&#039;m running 15.05.1 on the TP-Link WL-WR710N and I&#039;m looking for a configuration to bridge (masqueraded) two separate wifi networks into two other networks seperately of each other. (Incidentally one repeated network shall have no security (but thats not relevant IMHO) Here&#039;s a picture:</p><p>Internet &lt;-&gt; Wifi A (channel 6)&nbsp; *** &lt;-&gt; bridge 1 &lt;-&gt; *** Extended Wifi A1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Internet &lt;-&gt; Wifi B&nbsp; (channel 6) *** &lt;-&gt; bridge 2 &lt;-&gt; *** Extended Wifi B1</p><p>Everything between the stars ***, i.e. both bridges, shall take place on one device. <br />Network and device performance are not an issue! As I understand everything must be on one radio channel. Thats ok, too.</p><p>I would be very happy to receive some hints or maybe a concrete configuration to be used in&nbsp; /etc/config/{network,wireless,firewall}. If successfull I&#039;m very willing to use the input to enhance the wiki!<br />Thank you!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>heilbron</strong> on 1 Oct 2017, 13:37)</p>
