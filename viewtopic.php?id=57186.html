					<p>Apologies in advance if this has been asked and answered, if it has I was unable to find a resolution.</p><p>Have a TP-Link WR1043ND with Chaos Calmer loaded, seems to be working good.&nbsp; In playing with it I was trying to get a prolific USB serial port to setup as a serial console.&nbsp; Just in case I lost access but the device was not bricked.&nbsp; &nbsp;the PL2303 driver loads fine and the device is set to ttyUSB0.&nbsp; &nbsp;With that being said, when I connect to the serial port with SecureCRT on a windows system all I see at 115200 is garbage characters.&nbsp; &nbsp;Actually, a constant string of &quot;p&quot; scrolling across the terminal session.&nbsp; &nbsp;Have the setting set to 115200, 8, n, 1 with no flow control.&nbsp; I&#039;m using a null modem cable.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>
