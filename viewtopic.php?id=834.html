					<p>Hi,</p><p>for my Freifunk-Firmware project, I offer a web based &quot;Firmware Upgrade&quot; button realized with the mtd command which is part of both the Linksys and the OpenWRT suites. With one of my devices (a WRT45G V2.0) sometimes the flashed TRX/BIN file generated with the OpenWRT toolchain will hang during bootup. Serial console states &quot;Header checksum does not match&quot;. OK - no problem since TFTP is active without boot_wait in this state.</p><p>This occurs with the Linksys original web GUI update button as well as with a trx file manually written to flash using the mtd command.</p><p>If I rerun the trx utility manually, the next TRX/BIN file generated eventually is OK. This is likely a CRC calculation mismatch between this specific PMON/CFE and the trx tool (both OpenWRT trx and Linksys original trx tool show this behavior). N.B. If the trx file is OK, the BIN files always works.</p><p>So every time, I want to publish a new Freifunk-Firmware version, I am sitting there reflashing new BIN files until the CRC calculation matches.</p><p>Anybody heard about this? Workarounds?</p><p>Regards, Sven-Ola</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve had a few instances where it failed to flash correctly using the mtd util. It seems to be an issue with using mtd to reflash; when it failed I was able to send the exact same firmware through the bootloader&#039;s tftp.</p><p>Are you sure these crc errors you&#039;re claiming aren&#039;t just caused by a partial write?</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;am sure this is no partial write. And yes - the same file works with TFTP. It is always working with TFTP. I have checked several times (with single write op and with segmented write ops because not enough mem) to flash the same wrong TRX with mtd, but once wrong - ever wrong. I need to reissue the trx command to pack a new trx file -&gt; sometimes it&#039;s ok. Because the cramfs inside the trx will have a date stamp, a new crc will be calculated and sometimes this crc matches the crc calculated by PMON/CFE. I&#039;am pretty sure this is no &quot;file offsets&quot; issue. File offsets of bad/good trx are the same...</p>									</div>
