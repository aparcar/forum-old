					<p>You did not configure your overlay properly: instead of overlaying your external device on top of the internal overlay, you are mounting your external device instead of the internal overlay, thus all changes that are present on the internal overlay are lost.</p><p>Have a look to the overlay guide, and check how you should configure your fstab file.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes....exactly that line :-)</p><p>Another thing I saw in this guide was:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>System Upgrade

Recommended by extroot maintainer

I recommend that you DO NOT try to do upgrades using opkg upgrade.
You will likely end up with an inconsistent state and bricked router that way:

The main reason is that the uClibc ABI (Application Binary Interface) is unstable and changes from 
revision to revision, so binaries for one version of uClibc may be incompatible with versions from another.
Another problem that can arise is if you try to upgrade the kernel packages, then flash and reboot, but your
operation is interrupted in any way, then you will have a kernel and module mismatch and likely a brick.
Finally, if you upgrade all packages but the kernel and the kernel modules, some packages like iptables 
will be broken.</code></pre></div><p>What does this mean?<br />Kernel: If I wanna update the kernel this should only be done by installing the latest OpenWRT FW image (...sysupgrade.bin), right?<br />Packages: Can I update individual packages using &quot;opkg install &lt;pkgs&gt;&quot;?<br />Perhaps using &quot;opkg list-upgradable&quot; to find them. I could imaging that would be a good thing to do regularly?</p>									</div>
