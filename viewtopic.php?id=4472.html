					<p>HI, <br />after successfully flashing and configuring openwrt on my WRT54GL to work as routed client for an outdoor Alvarion DS11 access point, I&#039;m having a look on the ways to secure the wireless network. At now, the access point I&#039;m using doesn&#039;t support WPA/802.1x and my company have some customers asking about an extra security more than wep. </p><p>What do you suggest me to use ? <br />At the moment I would prefer more performance than more security.</p><p>I&#039;m doing some tests with openvpn, it works, but I haven&#039;t already done perfomance tests. </p><p>What kind of VPN shall I try to secure my network ? </p><p>Actually I think openvpn should be the one with the best encryption/lightweight ratio ... Is that right ? </p><p>Any suggestion will be useful <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> </p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenVPN has pretty good performance. They use UDP for the underlying transport.</p><p>Quite a few more primitive protocols use TCP. Having TCP layered onto TCP has penalties.</p><p>I recommend using 2,048 or 4,096-bit keys. It takes a bit longer for the initial connection, but for the session itself a different key is used anyway so the only place you notice it is during initial key exchange. Since my client locations all automatically connect to the server on boot, a few extra seconds then is not a big issue.</p><p>Use easy-rsa or tinyca to generate certificates with. Once you get it going, from then on it&#039;s as simple as:<br />./build-key client30<br />to build certificates for a new client</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve had IPSEC tunnels working between a pair of OpenWRT boxes with OpenS/WAN [*]. Again, haven&#039;t had a chance to test the performance.

					<p>Yeah, well if you are going to toss around language about IPSec being a recognized standard, so is PPTP.</p><p>While MS track record with it stinks generally, if used with EAP-TLS I&#039;m told it offers good security.

					<p>Well. thanks for every aswer. <br />My situation is that we have an existing infrastructure made with alvarion AP and clients and using zyxel firewall for VPN. This network is now used by public administration only, but we&#039;re up to resell internet access to private citizens and companies through that network. </p><p>The idea is to use WRT54GL as client, with a Linux firewall conneted to a shared HDSL for internet access. <br />VPN will be from WRTs to the linux firewall. I have already ipsec (openswan) installed on the linux firewall so I woild preffer that ... <br />I exclude pptp because is not too different from wep , as security level I mean. <br />However if openvpn is more lightweight I give it a try. </p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

But this is more suited to &#039;road warriors&#039; on dynamic IP addresses. If you&#039;re building a security gateway to protect a fixed subnet, it&#039;s probably simpler to use IPSEC native tunnel mode than to use L2TP over IPSEC transport mode.</p>									</div>

Look into your OpenVPN configuration and see what it uses. 3DES is slow; Blowfish was specially designed for running on 32-bit microprocessors and so should be fast.

					<p>PPTP also takes a great deal of CPU - the max throughput I&#039;ve found is about 300K per second out, although that can get about 50-100KB per second better when transfering large files.&nbsp; In, the service seems to run better for some reason, and you get perhaps double or triple the throughput.</p><p>Even though the CPU hangs at about 90 percent, the rest of the clients connected to the VPN network/internet through the router don&#039;t see any noticable reduction in speed of resolution of dns sites or transfer rates outside the PPTP connection (IE locally or over the traditional WAN link).&nbsp; It&#039;s actually quite solid.</p><p>PPTP got a bad name because of an early flaw that was quickly corrected way back when it was released.&nbsp; If you&#039;re half paying attention to other security, you shouldn&#039;t have a problem using PPTP for encryption.</p><p>Jim</p>									</div>
