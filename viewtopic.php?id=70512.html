					<p>Hi All,</p><p>I am using CC version and I want to trace which dts file is being used for build.</p><p>I use qualcomm chip-set IPQ8065 but hopefully it use similar way or standard way to select board specific dts file as there are many dts files and I have no idea which is really getting used.</p><p>when firmware generated boot, I can see /proc/device-tree/ to do reverse engineering to trace which is exact file I should change.</p><p>files are located at </p><p><strong>openwrt/qca/src//linux-3.14/arch/arm/boot/dts/qcom-ipq8064.dts<br /></strong></p><p>for this specific CC SDK but if I change board name is same in <strong>/proc/device-tree/board</strong></p><p>so I think I am just guessing everything and need to trace where in make file exact dts file is selected.</p>									</div>

					<p>Chaos Calmer didn&#039;t support ipq806x yet. Current trunk (respectively LEDE) however should work on quite a few ipq8064 and ipq8065 devices, with a little luck your particular device is already properly supported there.</p>									</div>
