					<p>Hi guys and gals,</p><p>It&#039;s my first post so don&#039;t beat me up. I&#039;ve been searching through the forum but didn&#039;t find a right solution for me. I&#039;ve got a configuration of all my hardware as it is shown here:<br /><a href="http://www.fotosik.pl"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://images28.fotosik.pl/321/291b7422d6e052c8.jpg" alt="http://images28.fotosik.pl/321/291b7422d6e052c8.jpg" /></span></a></p><p>However I don&#039;t know how to configure ASUS router and its /etc/config/network file in order to connect these two computers from LAN network to the main LAN so that they would be given an IP from main ADSL Linksys router and be visible in local network without doing additional NAT. I tried many different combinations in this file but never received any dhcp settings from Linksys router. <br />The Asus thing is visible from laptops using www or ssh connection, so the wireless connection is established (proper config in /etc/config/wireless) but I can&#039;t connect these two computers either using DHCP or static IPs. </p><p>Could you help me out with configuration of the network file?</p><p>BTW, I run kamikaze 7.09 due to some additional reasons.</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br />P.</p>									</div>

					<p>You should use a WDS connection between Linksys and Asus router, bridged to the LAN network on both sides. If you are using a normal client to master wireless connection, you should not bridge the wireless interface on the clients side, and use a different subnet there and routing between the subnets. Beware that this will separate the broadcast domain.<br />Bridging client wireless interfaces does not work/is not supported on all HW platforms, because of problems using more than one MAC address on the same wireless interface.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, WDS would be one of the best options but my linksys router, WAG200G and not WAG54G, does not seem to support this mode. I checked the MAC addresses by ifconfig command and all interfaces in Asus have the same MAC. Thus I think the bridging would be possible. Could anyone help me by showing here a possible network config file that would work?</p>									</div>
