					<p>Hi Vech, I&#039;m interested in this as well.</p><p>First, I&#039;m curious where on the &quot;official site&quot; you found an image for 14.07. The only prebuilt image I&#039;ve managed to locate is hosted at: <a href="http://openwrt.naberius.de/barrier_breaker/mr-mips/">http://openwrt.naberius.de/barrier_breaker/mr-mips/</a><br />Though this is referenced on the official wiki page for metarouter (<a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/mikrotik/metarouter">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/mikrotik/metarouter</a>), these images are obviously not provided by either the Openwrt team nor Mikrotik.</p><p>My biggest problem with this image is it is terribly unstable: if I&#039;m passing traffic to it, it eventually kernel panics. I&#039;d be happy to just find a good image of 14.07 that was stable, if anyone knows where one is or how to build it. I&#039;m assuming the patches hosted at the above url will build a similarly unstable image,&nbsp; as I&#039;ve found other posts with that complaint.</p><p>Anyway, I&#039;m also curious if anyone is working on building an image of 15.05 for Metarouter, as I&#039;d be willing to lend a hand.</p>									</div>
