					<p>Hi all.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got an old Netgear WRT1000v2 that I want to experiment with.&nbsp; That device will work on 15.05.1, but it needs some patches for the LEDs to work.&nbsp; So what&#039;s my best/the right approach?&nbsp; Do I:</p><p>1) DL &amp; install 15.05.1 &amp; then patch?

You can always get the sources and build an image yourself, but in this case you&#039;d be replacing the existing installation with a new one instead of &quot;patching it&quot; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>diagon wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>What&#039;s the diff between sysupgrade.bin &amp; factory.img?</p></blockquote></div><p>A sysupgrade.bin is intended for upgrading or downgrading from an existing OpenWRT installation to a newer or older version or variant. This is usually done from &quot;System -&gt; Backup/Flash Firmware&quot; section, or using the &#039;sysupgrade&#039; tool from command-line.</p><p>A factory.bin is intended for use with a router that has OEM-provided firmware installed. It is essentially an OpenWRT firmware that just contains some padding and magic numbers to make it compatible with whatever image format the OEM-provided firmware expects. A &quot;disguise&quot; would be a good word here. Factory.bin is an OpenWRT installation disguised to look like an OEM firmware, so the firmware that is already installed on the router will accept it without complaining.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>diagon wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>2) DL &amp; compile/install r49076 (right when the patches were added &amp; very close to r49022 / 15.05.1)</p></blockquote></div><p>If you use TRAC (dev.openwrt.org) to monitor these changes, then bear in mind that TRAC does not show everything. For example, if you look at the change history in the GitHub for Chaos Calmer (<a href="https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/commits/chaos_calmer">https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/commits/chaos_calmer</a>), you can see that the latest change shown in TRAC is not really _the_ latest change done to the branch. You can use text search to find the matching git commit.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>diagon wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>3) DL &amp; compile/install something more recent?</p></blockquote></div><p>This is always an option, and it is what I did for my router. I downloaded the GitHub Chaos Calmer branch, built an image for my router and flashed it.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>diagon wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Any pointers to HOWTO&#039;s for patching/compiling would also help.</p></blockquote></div><p>I first read through <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence</a> and then created a 64-bit VM with Debian 8 to act as my build environment. After installing the listed dependencies and getting the sources, I followed <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build</a> to update the feeds and build it up. Since I already had a previous Chaos Calmer edition on my router, I used &#039;opkg list-installed&#039; to get a list of packages that I&#039;d need to tick from &#039;make menuconfig&#039; to make my new image as close to original as possible.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>diagon wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I&#039;m a little confused about this firmware.&nbsp; As it&#039;s OpenWRT, is there some way to install it and then &quot;opkg update &amp;&amp; opkg dist-upgrade&quot; (or whatever the OpenWRT vernacular is)?</p></blockquote></div><p>There&#039;s no &#039;dist-upgrade&#039; option. You upgrade an OpenWRT router to a newer or older version by using the &#039;sysupgrade.bin&#039; images, like I explained above.</p>									</div>

Kmod-ledtrig-gpio is a module for driving the LEDs on your router based on GPIO events, such as pressing the &quot;WPS&quot; button, if your router has one. However, since only the sky is the limit on how the SoC&#039;s GPIO ports are configured on the PCB, it&#039;s really, really difficult to say if installing this module will help you.</p>									</div>

					<p>LEDE is the new openwrt and then when the merge happens they will call lede openwrt. There is no need to stick with 15.1 when there is a new build out with updated kernel and many many bug fixes! There mite be some packages that will not work on 15.1 any more or have bin updated.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tapper</strong> on 27 Jun 2017, 23:28)</p>

					<p>@tapper.&nbsp; Alright, man.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; As long as there&#039;s no major issue handling it when the transition comes, maybe I will go with LEDE.&nbsp; It looks easier than compiling my own.</p><p>By the way, you don&#039;t happen to know if tproxy is compiled into the OpenWrt/LEDE kernel, do you?&nbsp; I use sshuttle as a simple vpn, and forwarding UDP packets wants tproxy.</p>									</div>
