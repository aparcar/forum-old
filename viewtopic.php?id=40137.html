					<p>I want to upgrade my flash chip to change my firmware to OpenWRT but I&#039;m just not sure how to copy the current firmware over. I&#039;ve opened up the case, and found the chip at the bottom side of the PCB. I&#039;m ordering the Eon EN25Q64. It&#039;s 8MB so it should be fine. I just don&#039;t know how to copy the firmware of the old chip to the new chip. I haven&#039;t desolder anything yet, just asking for information. </p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=28343">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=28343</a> seems to be a relevant topic but these guys already have linux installed while I still have the Chinese firmware installed. How would you go onto upgrade the flash chip?</p><p>On a relevant note, WR702N has an empty USB space on the PCB. I guess it&#039;s identical to the USB-A in the WR703N. When should I solder in the USB plug, before or after upgrading to OpenWRT? (assuming I can change the flash chip)</p>									</div>

					<p>If you haven&#039;t got a programmer, use the method shown by griguolcomerranas in the link you posted.<br />As to when to add the usb socket: I would do one step at a time, that way if the unit doesn&#039;t work you can narrow down the source of the problem.</p>									</div>
