					<p>I just upgraded my router to the latest Backfire release 10.03.1 and now I&#039;m finding that LUCI is saying &quot;Collecting data&quot; on almost every page.&nbsp; Before the update I was running rc5 and everything worked perfectly.&nbsp; </p><p>I restored my original configuration files (from rc5) so perhaps I&#039;m missing a setting?&nbsp; Is there a daemon that needs to be running for LUCI to work?</p>									</div>

					<p>It might be just the browser cache. Icons &amp; other things were changed in the last few weeks.<br />You might try with another browser, and/or with clearing browser cache first.</p><p>Additionally, it is a good practice to make the config from scratch every now and then, as the built-in defaults do change and preserving the old configs does not allow new defaults to get applied. I do not remember any specific setting between rc5 and 10.03.1 which would cause that effect, but resetting the router to defaults might be a good idea in any case.</p><p>Read also: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=150910#p150910">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php â€¦ 10#p150910</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 28 Dec 2011, 18:26)</p>

					<p>Yeah, it was my browser cache.&nbsp; That was pretty silly of me.&nbsp; Oh well, maybe someone else will hit the problem.&nbsp; Thanks for the help.</p>									</div>
