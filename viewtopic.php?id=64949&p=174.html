					<p>Here is a test build for V1 owners who want to run kernel 4.9.&nbsp; Keep in mind that I don&#039;t have a V1 to test with, so you are downloading this at your own risk. Essentially, I just used the patch as was posted previously. Please report back if this works or not.&nbsp; Also, keep an eye on CPU thermals and you might tweak the fan setting to run more often.</p><p><a href="https://davidc502sis.dynamic-dns.net/releases/v1_4.9.zip">https://davidc502sis.dynamic-dns.net/re … v1_4.9.zip</a></p>									</div>

The reason why you dont experience it that often (never so far), is connected with two reasons as I see it. First, there is already a CPUIDLE disable patch included for the three models of 1900acs, 3200 and 1200, because they have all the same CPU (a different one than the 1900v1). Just look into your dmesg boot messages and you will find two lines for this (found armada bla bla is bugged bla cpuidle disabled bla). And you mostly dont do much with your routers triggering high cpu/ram usage.

					<p>I just had again another reboot. Of course there is nothing in the logs stored on the usb flash, how would it. I just used a &#039;logread -f &gt;&gt; /mnt/share/logging.log &amp;&#039; though, so that would never log dmesg outputs I guess, is there a way to write those too to file? Was just switching to my tablet via Synergy and puff, reboot. Weird how it always happens in situations where I do something. Last time it happened the instant where I was opening Luci in web browser. I am still somehow thinking the reboots just began happening after I updated the wifi driver / switched from build r5297. If I google about &quot;Bad page map in process &quot; people tell in other forums this may be related to bad RAM, heat problems, and/or CPU frequency issues.</p><p>Is there a way to check if those patches are working / cpuidle is really off (not compiled)? @racef@ce maybe the patch wasnt included in the rom by accident?</p><p>How would I properly disable ipv6 too btw, so just to test this theory? I doubt it would do anything about the bad page maps do I also have, which mostly trigger a reboot then once in a while, if it happens to a critical process.</p><p>Also the patch for disabling cpuidle and cpufreq wont rise temps really in my understanding because of how a (arm) cmos works. If its idling it doesnt matter much if its clocked 2ghz, 1ghz or 500mhz. It has no influence on the temps because no currents flow.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makedir</strong> on 19 Dec 2017, 00:33)</p>

The reason why you dont experience it that often (never so far), is connected with two reasons as I see it. First, there is already a CPUIDLE disable patch included for the three models of 1900acs, 3200 and 1200, because they have all the same CPU (a different one than the 1900v1). Just look into your dmesg boot messages and you will find two lines for this (found armada bla bla is bugged bla cpuidle disabled bla). And you mostly dont do much with your routers triggering high cpu/ram usage. For the first, I guess this patch might not work properly, and still leads to random but rare reboots.</p><p>Latest bug:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[190298.776912] swap_free: Bad swap file entry 00000c00
