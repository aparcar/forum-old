					<p>First let me ask, why are you just bringing up wan at a certain time?&nbsp; Do you have some kind of schedule where it takes the wan down then later it brings it back up?&nbsp; Say from 8 to 5, or whatever, you have wan up.&nbsp; Then you take it down after office hours?</p><p>Is this what you are doing?</p>									</div>

					<p>Alternatively, you could always schedule an automatic reboot every x hours or at specific hour.. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Why are you using reset button to restart your router?<br />Reset button is not equal to restart button....</p>									</div>

					<p>That is exactly why I was asking that question Eric...</p><p>Just do a reboot if you have some sporadic problem going on.&nbsp; </p><p>Or do an ifdown wan then do a reboot when you want it to come back up.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry for my inaccuracy. No no. &quot;ifup wan&quot; just reconnects wan (if it was already up before, what&#039;s the case), I&#039;m not bringing it up just at 3pm, I&#039;m doing a reconnect. I&#039;m doing this, because my ISP has a 24h auto disconnect, and I want it to happen every day at the same time, so it wouldnt happen sometimes during the evening.</p><p>It worked for years without any problem with my old router and 10.03. Since a few weeks I have a nrew router (wndr3800) and I&#039;m using trunk build.</p><p>With reset I just meant power off/on again, sorry again. And I don&#039;t want to reboot the router every 24h, because there is no reason for, just negative ones, if you let the one only positive out that the router could became unstable if you don&#039;t reboot it every few days, but I would just assume that&#039;s not the case.</p><p>I just don&#039;t know how this in my opinion uncritically command could let the router freeze or became unresponsable. With that I mean I cannot reach it anymoe over lan or wlan side. Wlan is still connected though but the IP is dead.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>knuddel</strong> on 22 Apr 2013, 08:47)</p>

					<p>I have another similiar problem, that &quot;reboot -f&quot; or just reboot ramdomly &quot;bricks&quot; the router&#039;s nic, so I have to do&nbsp; hard power off/on to get it work again. It mostly is somehow connected with this issue.</p>									</div>
