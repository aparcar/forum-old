					<p>ookeeey, i was a little bit too enthusiastic the last time.</p><p>the problem with the lcp-timeouts persists (but like above, its possible to connect every 10th try or so).</p><p>after connecting the ip-address is passed properly causing the client to be able to surf on the internet.<br />however, i got problems after that causing the wrt54gs to CRASH when visiting web-sites, or even creating some traffic on a remote ssh-session (while ping &amp; slow typing over ssh was ok).<br />i found out that this only happens when mppc (compression) is enabled, so i wrote &quot;nomppc&quot; in the options and everything works fine. (strange, but in the readme for pppd 2.4.3 it says, that mppc is proprietary and not supported anyway, although a kmod exists for that???).</p><p>so, if anyone can help me out with that lcp-timeout-problem, i would be very happy. everything is working now but its not a statisfying solution to &quot;dial&quot; the vpn-server several times before a connection is possible.<br />any ideas or hints?</p>									</div>

(although it behaves a bit different: when the connection is established (only possible every 4th try) the thing gets stuck while checkig the password (according to windows)).</p><p>so the question is: why does windows sometimes send lcp-packets and sometimes not???<br />btw, it tested it today with another notebook, so i checked with three different computers (2x XP Pro, 1x XP home with SP2) and all with different wlan-adapters (also checked via cable, like mentioned above).</p><p>...and i just noticed some interesting fact: the connection seems to be possible *exactly* every 4th try. i think this &quot;counter&quot; must be somewhere in windows, because its independent from the wrt. i can try 2x to connect, reboot the wrt and then try another time and the try after that will succeed (scheme: fail, fail, fail, success or: fail, fail, (reboot wrt), fail, success, etc.). same thing is when connecting parallel from different computers- they all succeed on *their* own 4th connection-try. its also possible to increase this mystic-counter by executing vpn-connections to completely different servers like: (wrt)fail, (connect to different server, doesnt matter wether successful or not), (wrt)fail, (wrt)success and so on.<br />this is consistent with my logfile-observation above. windows behaves 3x in a passive way and initiates lcp every 4th time.<br />however, windows is working with my debian-pptp very well (everytime), so windows can&#039;t be the problem. i will compare my debian-pptp-debug-logs with the wrt-ones tomorrow, maybe i get a clue from that.</p>									</div>

					<p>hm, well im confused about the versions, but i am not running the &quot;offical&quot; experimental release, but the modified stable version from TheRodent (see above). experimental is kernel 2.4.29 afaik, my kernel is 2.4.20.<br />i dont think that this build is affected by the missing patch since am able to connect (but only every 4th try) with mppe-128, and additionally, the problem should also be solved if i disable mppe/mppc which is not happening. <br />(i would try to get experimental patched by myself but i read that pppd is broken in that release, so i wouldnt be able to run pptpd anyway)</p><p>i also tried &quot;dd-wrt&quot;, a firmware based von sveasoft with some code from openwrt (pptpd is build-in there), and the vpn-thing works, they are using pppd 2.4.2 (like me) but pptpd 1.1.4-b4. i dont know if the whole thing is related to pptpd but my last hope is to get it working with that version, so ill try to get this version running on openwrt.</p><p>oh btw, happy easter <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>no, it worked for me with the precompiled binaries. but did you skipped the ppp_generic module? that was essential for me.</p><p>enable debugging-mode in /etc/pptp.conf and /etc/ppp/pptp-server-options (just write &quot;debug&quot; in the first line of the files), restart pptpd and try to reconnect, than take a look at the syslog with &quot;logread&quot;.<br />you will see the reason why pppd has died- maybe an issue with the modules or wrong parameters in pptp-server-options.<br />(the default config-file shipped with the pptpd-package had wrong syntax on my system, statements like &quot;require-mppe-128&quot; were not recognized, i had to change it to &quot;mppe-128 required&quot;).</p>									</div>
