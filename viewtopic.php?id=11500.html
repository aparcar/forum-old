					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;m running WR on a Asus WL-500g Premium and I like it a lot.<br />For measurement and displaying of statistics I use RRD. Works fine and looks good and writes the database files and PNG&#039;s to a USB memorystick with ext3 format. But, the question: ..... will it destroy the memorystick?<br />It is writing several files every 10 minutes. This makes 6 times 24 hours is 144 writes per day.<br />Would it be better to do the &#039;writes&#039; to the memory of the router (/tmp ?) and let cron make a copy ones in a while to the USB-stick?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>C4Vette</strong> on 4 Jul 2007, 14:21)</p>
