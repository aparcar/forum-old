					<p>Hi Guys, </p><p>I have a IB-NAS4220B that I have installed OpenWRT on from <a href="https://github.com/tobiaswaldvogel/openwrt-ib42x0">https://github.com/tobiaswaldvogel/openwrt-ib42x0</a> and it works very well but I would like to be able to use it to monitor my network using SNMP. </p><p>I have compiled Luci-app-statistics and collectd-mod-snmp for the system along with a couple of other collectd mods. Now I can see the other plugins under the Statistics tab in the WebUI but cannot see SNMP.</p><p>If I run collectd from the command line I get some errors about some plugins that aren&#039;t installed along with some messages about missing MIBs I also get a similar issue when running the snmpwalk command so I would assume the issue is something to do with libnetsnmp or snmp-utils but I havent got a clue where to start fixing the issue. </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@NAS4220B:~# collectd
