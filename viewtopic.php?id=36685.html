					<p>I need to change the whole flash content on my DIR-825, including u-boot and other partitions. Vavasik gave me a full flash for the Netgear 3700 that I intend to flash it with so I can do the 128MB mod. I have read somewhere that if I compile my own firmware I can make u-boot and other partitions writable and then be able to replace the whole flash, ie full flash. Can someone confirm this and perhaps give me a few pointers on how to erase the DIR-825 full firmware and write the new full netgear 3700 firmware instead? </p><p>Thanks in advance!<br />Lennart</p>									</div>
