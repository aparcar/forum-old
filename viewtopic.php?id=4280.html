					<p>Yes ist works. At least for eth1(wlan) on the WRT. Observed a funny side effect (on my notebook only, 2.6.x kernel): That thing does not reply to ARP any more and I have to run tcpdump (==promisc) for a network connection on eth0(notebook). May be a local fault. Another observation: Running mrouted or pimd (ipks on freifunk download) switched to allmulticast at least for br0 and eth1 (br0 has vlan0 only). May have side effects for devices in the bridge on wrt&#039;s - still need some testing...</p><p>P.S: In difference to OpenWrt the Freifunk kernel has MROUTE and PIMv2 enabled in the kernel. I doubt that this has a broader audience, but I spent that additional ~10k to ~16k in the kernel to make our playground more interesting <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
