					<p>Hello all,</p><p>I just purchased a WRTSL54S and a Logitech QuickCam Pro 5000 to setup video streaming, etc.</p><p>According to <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/webcam">this</a> I need to install a Linux UVC driver in order to get this camera to work. But under White Russian RC6 or Kamikaze 7.07 I can&#039;t find the necessary driver via ipkg. Upon closer inspection of the aforementioned page it seems this module is available for Kamikaze releases greater than 7.07 (a developer release I&#039;m guessing?):</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>The modules are available to Kamikaze &gt; 7.07 and can be installed with ipkg</p></blockquote></div><p>Until this module is made available in a public release does anyone know how I can setup a UVC camera?</p><p>A patch for linux-uvc modules is referenced <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/1997">here</a> but I don&#039;t know how to go about installing this on my own. Can someone give me pointers on how to do this?</p><p>Thanks!<br />Joe</p>									</div>

					<p>I believe it will only work on the 2.6 Kernel as that&#039;s what it was written for, support for the 2.4 Kernel would need to be written by the developers.<br />I could be wrong though.</p><p>I have found it is fairly stable on OpenWRT 7.07, me and a few friends have knocked up a webpage for support with the Logitech Orbit with Pan/Tilt control with the SVN version of Motion on UVC, so far so good (It&#039;s not without its bugs though). I am very grateful for the person at naaa.de for compiling the UVC module for OpenWRT <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>-Rip</p>									</div>
