					<p>Hi, there are no installation instructions for the Trendnet TEW-712BR</p><p>I read the wiki pages on how to install openwrt and it says if there are no instructions, to use the generic flashing wiki page (i can&#039;t post links to these pages)</p><br /><p>But I am a&nbsp; complete newbie when it comes to this, can someone advise me how to install the openwrt firmware for this specific router?</p><p>The main thing I want to use it for is as a client bridge or wireless bridge or whatever you call it.</p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, also a question about a bridged client, do I need to install openwrt on the main router/gateway too in order to do this? If so, I won&#039;t even bother then since that is not possible for my main router (it is a Pace 5268ac)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>VietnamTom</strong> on 31 Mar 2017, 05:22)</p>

					<p>Can someone help, if I want a bridged client to connect to my Pace 5268ac, can I do it without installing openwrt on the Pace, which is not possible?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>VietnamTom</strong> on 1 Apr 2017, 03:52)</p>

					<p>I read the wiki pages on openwrt client bridging and it is confusing to me, but then I found a tutorial someone made on stackoverflow (Search for luci bridge, the first result, i can&#039;t post url)<br />His steps (without the pictures) are:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>To achieve this, you need to first set your LAN interface to static on Router B. Then in the physical settings for LAN, bridge it between eth1 and your master WIFI.

Then head to Network-&gt; Wifi-&gt; Scan and Join Router A as a client and assign network to wwan.

Finally create an AP and link it to the lan interface. (Network-&gt; Wifi-&gt; Add)</code></pre></div><p>this is exactly what I want to do with my TEW-712BR , my computer, and my main Pace router, will this work?</p><p>how come the wiki pages don&#039;t have this tutorial, they make it seem like it is impossible to do...</p><br /><p>edit: well, I did it, except I followed a different tutorial that was even simpler than the one I posted above (google search &quot;ediy client mode&quot;)<br />can someone confirm this tutorial does things correctly? my connection is working so I think it is correct, but it would be nice to have confirmation I did it right</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>VietnamTom</strong> on 2 Apr 2017, 05:10)</p>
