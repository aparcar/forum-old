					<p>Dear Owen,</p><p>Thank you for your recent email regarding our recent driver release – we appreciate your feedback, comments and suggestions.</p><p>As you are probably aware, the semiconductor industry is increasingly blighted by the issue of counterfeit chips and all semiconductor vendors are taking measures to protect their IP and the investment they make in developing innovative new technology. FTDI will continue to follow an active approach to deterring the counterfeiting of our devices, in order to ensure that our customers receive genuine FTDI product. Though our intentions were honorable, we acknowledge that our recent driver update has caused concern amongst our genuine customer base.&nbsp; I assure you, we value our customers highly and do not in any way wish to cause distress to them.</p><p>The recently release driver release has now been removed from Windows Update so that on-the-fly updating cannot occur. The driver is in the process of being updated and will be released next week. This will still uphold our stance against devices that are not genuine, but do so in a non-invasive way that means that there is no risk of end user’s hardware being directly affected.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>As previously stated, we recommend to all our customers to guarantee genuine FTDI products please purchase either from FTDI directly or from one of our authorised distributors.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/FTSalesNetwork.htm">http://www.ftdichip.com/FTSalesNetwork.htm</a></p><p>If you are concerned that you might have a non-genuine device, our support team would be happy to help out.</p><p>Yours Sincerely</p><p>Fred Dart - CEO</p>									</div>
