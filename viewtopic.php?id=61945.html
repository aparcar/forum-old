					<p>I have an EDIMax 7811U USB Wireless adapter which I am running as a second radio in my travel router. (HooToo TM-02).&nbsp; I have installed it with kmod-rtl8192cu and it&#039;s dependencies.&nbsp; I have used this in my PCs for quite a while and generally get good wireless performance.&nbsp; When I connect this to the HooToo it takes the 12Mb performance of the router&#039;s single radio down to about 5Mb.&nbsp; </p><p>I do not know if the issue is the wireless adapter, the router, or something else.&nbsp; I would appreciate hearing from others who use these devices in hopes of finding a better performing unit.&nbsp; Please include your USB Wireless Device make and Model, the router you are using and the packages you installed to support it.</p>									</div>

					<p>not really. do you have more networks around you? if yes this can be checked with airodump-ng, for example if it has sensitivity about -70dBm it won&#039;t display a network with -87dBm. in windows you can confirm this if all networks are having 3 or more bars. but if some of them have 1-2 bars then it has sensitivity about -90dBm and with airodump-ng you should see these networks with levels down to -97dBm.</p>									</div>
