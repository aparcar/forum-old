					<p>I got one of those little aa to USB &quot;emergency chargers&quot; and it happily runs the GL-AR150.</p><p>The 2AA version with 2400mah cells managed to provide 1150mah @5v which gave around 6 hours of light-medium usage over wifi. (streaming wifi radio)</p><p>It runs the cells into the ground and doesn&#039;t seem very graceful when the cells actually die but it&#039;s good for light usage.</p><p>The USB charger doesn&#039;t seem to have anything limiting the current, it says max output is 500ma but will provide 700ma to my phone, it&#039;s probably why so many people say they melt.
