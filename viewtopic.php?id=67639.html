					<p>Hi, guys. Trying to do VPN connection on my Mikrotik through OpenWRT for 2 weeks. Mikrotik RouterBOARD 951G 2HnD. I did WAN port on the router (its 1st port), did LAN ports (2nd - master, other - slaves), did wi-fi, all is working. But I need VPN connection through my wi-fi. So I installed OpenWRT as virtual router and used Metarouter for it. But when Im adding some interfaces on OpenWRT its crushing in 10-15 mins, rebooting and crushing again in 10-15 mins.<br />Asking community to help, because totally dont know what to do now <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> Ofc I had tried to google it.<br />The result I want to get: OpenWRT connecting as client to the VPN (im using AirVPN if important) server and giving this connection through wi-fi. And no crushing ofc)</p><p>P.S. Sorry for my bad english(</p>									</div>
