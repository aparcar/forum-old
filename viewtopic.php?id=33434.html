					<p>Hello,</p><p>Its been a long time since I&#039;ve used OpenWRT but ever since I got my fresh new router and needed samba 3 support, I decided to switch. Unfortunately, the HowTo on the Guest WLAN just didnt work for me. I found the following configuration the best for my network. </p><p>Letting you know know now that I have 1 Private Network on radio0 (the bgn) and 1 Public Network on radio0. I also have the same set up on radio1 (the an 5Ghz).</p><p>So this is my following configuration:</p><p>I added this to my /etc/config/network:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface guest
        option proto static
        option ipaddr 10.0.0.1
        option netmask 255.255.255.0
        option type bridge</code></pre></div><p>I added this to my /etc/config/wireless:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;wifi-iface&#039;
        option &#039;device&#039; &#039;radio0&#039;
        option &#039;network&#039; &#039;guest&#039;
        option &#039;mode&#039; &#039;ap&#039;
        option &#039;ssid&#039; &#039;Public Network&#039;
        option &#039;encryption&#039; &#039;none&#039;

config &#039;wifi-iface&#039;
        option &#039;device&#039; &#039;radio1&#039;
        option &#039;mode&#039; &#039;ap&#039;
        option &#039;network&#039; &#039;guest&#039;
        option &#039;ssid&#039; &#039;Public Network 5G&#039;
        option &#039;encryption&#039; &#039;none&#039;</code></pre></div><p>I added this to my /etc/config/dhcp:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config dhcp guest
        option interface guest
        option start 100
        option limit 150
        option leasetime 1h</code></pre></div><p>I added this to my /etc/config/firewall:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config zone
        option name &#039;guest&#039;
        option input REJECT
        option forward REJECT
        option output ACCEPT

config forwarding
        option src guest
        option dest wan

config rule
        option src guest
        option dest_port 53
        option proto tcpudp
        option target ACCEPT

config rule
        option src guest
        option src_port 67-68
        option dest_port 67-68
        option proto udp
        option target ACCEPT</code></pre></div><p>and thats it! This configuration gave me a 4 wireless networks and also took care of the problem I was having before with the Guest Networks not getting an ip address. Now, guest networks get an ip address. Also, I noticed that guest networks cannot access 192.168.1.1 or the router homepage. I hope this helps somebody, as I wasnt able to do it with the guide that was posted on the openwrt website. </p><p>Enjoy guys! Thanks for everything!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>checkm8</strong> on 10 Dec 2011, 19:23)</p>

					<p>Thats exactly the same procedure which is documented in the wiki, with two differences:<br /> - you made the guest interface a bridge, which is correct if you attach two aps to it<br /> - you bridged the guest networks to wan, which makes no sense at all and only works by accident</p>									</div>

					<p>jow thank you for your reply. Ive been afraid to ask, but what would be the correct configuration then for the Guest WLAN on the WNDR3700?</p><p>What do you mean this only works by accident?</p><p>Thanks ahead of time for your reply and im sorry if i confused anybody with my configuration.</p>									</div>

					<p>I confused it with another model. Anyway, the &quot;option ifname eth0.2&quot; part is unecessary snake-oil, there is no vlan2 defined by default. <br />The only difference that remains between your config and the one in the wiki is the &quot;option type bridge&quot;.</p>									</div>

					<p>jow thank you so much. I removed &#039;option ifname eth0.2&#039; and it still works perfectly.</p><p>Thanks! I will edit the original so it doesnt confuse anyone.</p>									</div>

					<p>You&#039;re welcome. Actually I wouldn&#039;t mind adding the bridge directive to the wiki howto as it does not really hurt, even when only a signle guest network is used.</p>									</div>
