					<p>First, I&#039;m trying a clean copy of 2.6 for my own curiousity... rather than backup my .config and start again i&#039;ve chosen to just leave my old tweaks alone and start from scratch... </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># mkdir clean; cd clean

Checked out revision 11117.

					<p>Hi there,<br />I think the wireless support for the wl520gu causes problems with the 2.6 version.&nbsp; I tried the same approach as wl520gu-hax, just with wireless drivers commented out:<br /># CONFIG_PACKAGE_kmod-b43=y<br /># CONFIG_PACKAGE_kmod-mac80211=y</p><p>I can then upload the firmware and log in.

					<p>Hi, this is really encouraging to see that the USB is more resilient with your changes. Good luck on your wireless adventure.<br />(edit)<br />Just wondering, would it be possible that the approach of the sbrown patch could be used to address the stability issues in the 2.4 kernel with USB. i.e. are the problems occuring from the same core issues, and can a similar patch be applied to the 2.4 sources and then allow seamless integration of the working wlan modules?<br />Cheers.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>peterepeat</strong> on 15 May 2008, 16:59)</p>

					<p>Hi Guys,<br />I finally gave up on the USB serial support for this little guy. I called Maxim and ordered some samples of the max233. It&#039;s an all in one chip that converts the 5v levels from the on board serial converter to RS232. No need for capacitors or other components. I then wired those lines to three of the unused pins on one of the Ethernet ports and made a custom cable to take the signals right out the back on the WAN RJ45. I&#039;m not using the WAN port so no harm. On these Ethernet ports only four of the 8 pins are used. It&#039;s what they use now a days for POE. Just continuing my testing tonight and so far it&#039;s rock solid. Now I&#039;m going ahead to create some little daughter boards that can be easily soldered in place to provide the RS232. Maybe I&#039;ll make a kit for sale, reasonable priced for others if anyone&#039;s interested. Got to make 50 or so to make it worth while spinning the boards. It&#039;s been such a battle with the USB that I finally just gave up. So now I&#039;m running the 2.4 kernel with full wireless support and a kick a$$ serial port, too cool. And best of all, this&nbsp; solution is about the same price as a USB dongle, but more flexible. Let me know what you think. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Shawn</p>									</div>
