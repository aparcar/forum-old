					<p>Except that I then have to hook up a hub (maybe even powered?) and/or break open the case to get to the second USB port. I&#039;d like to deploy the camera into a hard-to-reach place (up in the attic in the rafters), and the less moving parts I need, the better.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, you&#039;d need a hub, but to my experience, a bus powered hub is sufficient for a cam and a small usb stick.</p><p>Do you have 230V available up there? If yes, maybe the DIR-505 would be an alternative. Has double the flash memory than the MR-3020, so no need for extrooting or a hub but also no need to worry about space, since you can do a lot with 8MB (or what remains of it after FW flashing).</p><p>I have several webcams attached to a DIR-505 (see signature). Working fine for me!</p><p>A &#039;plus&#039; for me: DIR-505 has an integrated power supply in a solid plug-brick, so no need for separate power adapter + cables. Just plug it into the next mains outlet.

					<p>Also consider writing a little bit of LUA code to do the HTTP upload. There&#039;s some server-side code in /usr/lib/lua/luci/http.lua and /usr/lib/lua/luci/http/*. You could probably reuse some of it and build an HTTP uploader.</p>									</div>

					<p>I ran into an issue with trying to use software that wouldn&#039;t fit on board so i edited my /etc/rc.local with:</p><p>opkg update<br />opkg install curl -d ram<br />rm /tmp/opkg-lists/*</p><p>So that it would just install it to ram on reboot so it would be available. You may need to edit your exports so it can find it in the ram destination.</p><p>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=&#039;/lib:/usr/lib:/tmp/lib:/tmp/usr/lib&#039;<br />export PATH=&#039;/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/tmp/usr/bin:/tmp/usr/sbin&#039;</p><p>This way I am able to use it as if it were installed locally and not just re-installed on reboot.</p>									</div>
