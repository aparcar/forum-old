					<p>Hi all.</p><p>I bought one of these routers thinking it was a g300nh, and was very glad to see that fullstop had managed to get things working.</p><p>That was back in October and I&#039;ve been using a fairly cut down version of OpenWRT since then, as packages can&#039;t be added due to the firmware being out of date.</p><p>I was also glad to see that the necessary information has been added to svn for this router, but when I tried to flash the router with the snapshots from 25th and 29th Jan, they both failed - the router diag light just regularly flashes red twice.</p><p>I had the same problem before when I flashed the wrong firmware, so I know what those lights mean, but I have checked and re-checked that I have the correct tftp version of openwrt for the wzr-g300nh2, and I&#039;ve flashed and reflashed it, but still nothing is working.</p><p>I know the flashing itself is working, as after going through the whole static ARP, starting TFTP and plugging the router in procedure, the diag light flashes continuously to indicate it&#039;s received the new firmware and is updating, but then it goes back to the double red flash.</p><p>Fullstop, if you are reading this, have you updated to these newer versions?</p><p>I also tried compiling OpenWRT from scratch, but got various errors, so gave up for now.</p><p>If anyone can help, I would be grateful.</p><p>Cheers</p>									</div>

					<p>icents,</p><p>I flashed a G300NH2 with the Feb 2nd tftp image (<a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-wzr-hp-g300nh2-squashfs-tftp.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ â€¦ s-tftp.bin</a>) and booted it up.</p><p>I&#039;ve not done much testing with it, but here is a boot log: <a href="http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=L2QqYk3B">http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=L2QqYk3B</a></p><br /><p>With this image, the red diagnostic LED is solid red once the boot is complete.</p><p>You can try the image that I tried or connect a serial cable to your router to see what&#039;s happening.&nbsp; The numbers on the back of my router case are A0 A0.&nbsp; What are yours?</p><p>I doubt that Buffalo has made a hardware change on the G300NH2, but you never know.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Sorry it&#039;s been so long.</p><p>Unfortunately my router is still bricked.</p><p>The numbers on the back of my router case are also A0 A0.</p><p>The TFTP upload still seems to work fine, but when it reboots, it&#039;s straight back to the double flashing diag light!</p><p>I&#039;ve just opened the router up to see if I could find anything out, and the only thing I notice is that the board has the model number &quot;WZR-HP-G302HV2&quot; written on it, although I&#039;ve seen this mentioned elsewhere for the g300nh2 - is yours the same?</p><p>Is it possible to use TFTP to reflash the original buffalo dd-wrt firmware?</p><p>I&#039;m not sure whjat else to try.</p><p>Do you think it&#039;s possible that some of the tftp transfer is being missed somehow? I&#039;m thinking this is unlikely seeing as it uses TCP.</p><p>Anyway, thanks for your feedback so far - hopefully we&#039;ll get to the bottom of this.</p><p>Cheers - centsi.</p>									</div>

					<p>Oh, BTW, how can I connect a serial cable?</p><p>I presume it will involve soldering, as I can&#039;t see any pins anywhere.</p><p>Cheers - centsi</p>									</div>
