					<p>If anyone has any solutions to improve OpenWrt&#039;s 2M support I&#039;d love to hear them.

					<p>Hmmm.</p><p>According to <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WRT54G">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har … sys/WRT54G</a> your unit came with VxWorks and does not have<br />the CFE bootloader on it. That means you can&#039;t use the tftp feature as fas as i understand. In the above document is a link to instructions<br />on how to install dd-wrt on a unit like yours - but as you now flashed a version of openwrt which denies any write access to the device and<br />you have no CFE boot loader to use the tftp load during boot up - i don&#039;t see a way to reflash your unit. Right?! Anyway...</p><p>Maybe JTAG is an option but that&#039;s far beyond my skills and involves some hardware mods i think. Ah buying an GL version is an option too... ;-)</p><p>EDIT: Just had another idea... would it be possible to to trick the unit and wget an firmware image on /tmp and then use mtd to flash it?<br />You wrote that you can&#039;t backup yout firmware because /tmp has not enough space. How much space is there. Is it writeable?</p><p>bye<br />dude</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>thedude</strong> on 28 Mar 2007, 01:34)</p>

					<p>The process of loading anything other than vxworks on a 2M router involves loading CFE, even though that&#039;s usually not clearly stated. You don&#039;t have enough ram to download a firmware image to /tmp, but mtd can be used with stdin if you want to pipe the firmware to it.</p><p>As for the tftp thing, OpenWrt does not run a tftp server, CFE should run one if boot_wait is on but I&#039;m unclear as to what address that version of CFE uses for it. It&#039;s possible that you had the right ip address but the wrong mac address cached in your arp table.</p><p>PS. I hate 2M routers and this thread illustrates why.</p>									</div>
