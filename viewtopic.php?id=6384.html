					<p>Henryk Pl√∂tz attempted an alsa-lib install in <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/486">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/486</a> a while back, I&#039;m trying to regenerate this project and get alsa working in OpenWrt.&nbsp; This would allow multi channel sound cards and more conventional sound applications to all work on openwrt.</p><p>I&#039;ve got two packages that both compile fine for me, but still dont give me working alsa;<br /><a href="http://www.voodoowarez.com/wrt/alsa-lib.tar.gz">http://www.voodoowarez.com/wrt/alsa-lib.tar.gz</a><br /><a href="http://www.voodoowarez.com/wrt/mpd.tar.gz">http://www.voodoowarez.com/wrt/mpd.tar.gz</a></p><p>The notable difference between this and henryk&#039;s is that I simply manually drop into the uclib buildroot and add wordexp, since the alsa functionality that uses wordexp is actually kind of critical for a large number of apps.&nbsp; Its also alsa-lib 1.0.11rc4, which matches/matched the most recent alsa on openwrt.&nbsp; When i last worked on this, all the dev work was still in trunk, so this is still kamikazee work, not buildroot-ng.</p><p>These attempts dont really cover that much ground, but I kind of deadlocked myself and didnt know where to go.&nbsp; Getting real sound support on openwrt is a very important goal to me, and I&#039;d be delighted to help fruther this however possible.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello.</p><p>Have you made any progress on this?</p><p>I am also trying to make a working alsa lib to use with a midi interface I have, hopefully to make&nbsp; a working wireless midi node with my router.</p><p>when I try to launch my midi app, I get this error message :</p><p>root@OpenWrt:/multimidicast# multimidicast<br />multimidicast v1.1 (c) 2005 by Dirk Jagdmann &lt;doj@cubic.org&gt;<br />multimidicast: can&#039;t resolve symbol &#039;wordexp&#039;</p><p>Is this normal? Do you have the same problems on your end?<br />I just compiled your lib and installed the .ipkg file on my router. When you say you &quot;droppped manually into the uclib buildroot and add wordexp&quot;, are any other files from the system affected?</p><p>Also, inside your patch file is mention of the 1.0.9 lib sources. Why is that?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
