					<p>I have the EA4500 (<a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/ea4500">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/ea4500</a>). I&#039;m using the image from Candyhouse: openwrt-kirkwood-ea4500-squashfs-factory.bin (ec857e1e85eb4963ea2048693e93a4ee)</p><p>I would like to get onto the &quot;official&quot; trunk builds. The wiki page has the following guidance: </p><p>As of r47458 the E4200v2 and EA4500 are completely supported. These boards are identified by the codename &quot;Viper.&quot;</p><p>When I flash the latest prebuilt image: d8b72c4e57bb03f15ae3d9e7559fade2 *openwrt-kirkwood-linksys-viper-squashfs-sysupgrade.tar The router never stops pulsating/flashing the led. I upgraded using Luci.&nbsp; If I repeatedly press the reset button and do a bunch of reboots, it will start flashing quickly, and then come back to the candyhouse image. (failsafe?) </p><p>Is this just a problem with this router, or am I doing something wrong? Do I have to build my own images, or should the prebuilt ones suffice? </p><p>Oh, btw, initially I tried flashing the stock firmware with the truck image: 0ea706aeb159963d2dfd94ac3608bb74 *openwrt-kirkwood-linksys-viper-squashfs-factory.bin but the stock firmware did not accept it.</p>									</div>
