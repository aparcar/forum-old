					<p>Hey guys, thanks for reading!</p><p>I bought a new Archer C7 v2 and flashed OpenWRT on it. All fine (it&#039;s my first time with openwrt) but unfortunately the router wasn&#039;t stable with OpenWRT. Yesterday I tried to go back to the original firmware so I downloaded the .bin from the TP-LINK website and used the OpenWRT CLI method to go back. </p><p>No errors until rebooting.. but then it never really rebooted well. I see I should have removed the boot part... well I didn&#039;t unfortunately.</p><p>I&#039;m now trying to restore it through TFTP and tried a lot of different firmwares. The server transfers the file correctly, device reboots and then only the LAN port &amp; power light up. I can&#039;t connect to the router and the original firmware isn&#039;t restored. </p><p>As I told I tried multiple firmwares (stripped boot one&#039;s, found a few in these forums as well, tried OpenWRT Chaos Calmer again, nothing works). </p><p>I really can&#039;t figure it out, it&#039;s my first time, and it looks like the TFTP method does work and transfers correctly, but immediately afte rit something goes wrong... I tried it on 2 different PC&#039;s with firewalls disabled. </p><p>Does anyone have any tips or firmware&#039;s I can try?</p>									</div>

First flash I flashed an original image (not trimmed) and that broke it. Now I&#039;m trying pre-trimmed images but I can&#039;t get it to work (through TFTP). Really don&#039;t have&nbsp; a clue what to try!</p>									</div>

					<p>Never had to do the trim to get tftp image on this device:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=301490#p301490">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 90#p301490</a><br />Which .bin?

					<p>Hmm, this is a EU device so that might be a problem. I tried the latest v2 firmware from the TP-link website as well but didn&#039;t work either. </p><br /><p>EDIT: got it working, finally! I found a guy who posted about polish firmware&#039;s (without boot) which are much larger than the US firmware&#039;s I flashed. Did exactly the same and it worked!! Here&#039;s the link including the firmwares: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=282503#p282503">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 03#p282503</a> <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
