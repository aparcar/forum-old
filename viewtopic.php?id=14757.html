					<p>hi, i have jst recieved a dlink 614+ airbus router from a freind, and i wanted to extend my existing wireless network with it. i have done this before using the &quot;reapeater&quot; mode in DD-WRT, but it seems to be more difficult with this router.&nbsp; researching this, i am pretty sure that a need to flash this router with Kamikaze, but i am having trouble finding the right version to do this. there seemsto be alot of controversy over the arm7 processor it has, is there even a version of kamikaze that is compatible with this, or do i need to modify a image ofan existing one?<br />note:the router is the first version with 2 antennas<br />-srry i do not know that much about open-wrt or kamikaze, and it all seems very daunting right now</p>									</div>
