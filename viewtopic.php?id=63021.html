					<p>Hey,</p><p>few days ago I want to install original firmware of this specific router, but fail.<br />I wanted to do the upgrade via LuCI interface but backfire version of openwrt did not let me do that in LuCI. (was saying that the image is in unsupported format)<br />So then I choose to do the upgrade via console but I was sloppy and I wrote the command<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mtd -r write /tmp/original_firmware.bin </code></pre></div><p> (without firmware at the and of the statement) </p><p>after that I can only access the router via web at 192.168.1.1 but can not login to it. Tried a lot of different options with usernames like admin, administrator, user, root, &lt;nousername&gt; but as mentioned before with no success.</p><p>Does anybody have any idea how to bring this router back to life or is this a dead end?<br />I eventually want to flash router back to openwrt but newer version (chaos calmer with minimal packages and wpa_supplicant as replacement for wpamini)</p>									</div>

					<p>If you can access the router at <a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a> it is not bricked.

Search for &quot;factory reset&quot; or &quot;hard reset&quot;.

Press and hold the reset button for 30 seconds.<br />2. Then, unplug the power keep holding down the reset button for<br />another 30 Seconds.<br />3. Plug back the power back in, and keep holding down the reset button<br />for 30 Seconds.<br />4. Release the reset button.</p><p>Good luck.</p>									</div>

					<p>I doubt you will have any success with CC on this 16MB RAM device. But if you are successful, please let us know.</p>									</div>

Hard reset was the solution.<br />I will update you how will things go with CC on this router. I hope that things go well (like with tp-link wr841n), however I am most certain that opkg will not work due to lack of space..</p>									</div>
