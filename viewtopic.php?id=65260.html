					<p>Hi everyone. I&#039;m new here, and this is my first post. Yey! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />I have a little special case.<br />My wifi router is a <span class="bbu">D-link DWR-956</span>, purchased from Telenor Norway (an isp/phone company).<br />It&#039;s an LTE/4G router, with 802.11ac support.<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/FW7Dzho.jpg?2" alt="http://i.imgur.com/FW7Dzho.jpg?2" /></span></p><p>I couldn&#039;t find ANY information on the web about this router. Not from Telenor, and not from D-link.<br />Nothing at all...<br />They even encrypted the firmware updates, so analyzing them was impossible.</p><p>Well, i&#039;ve been tinkering with this device for a while now, and I&#039;ve learnt a greaet deal doing so.<br />I managed to get a serial-console on the device after locating the UART headers.<br />U-boot was very limited, So I had to load the mtd partitions, and UBI partitions into memory, then dump the content of the memory to the screen while logging everything.<br />Afterwards i had to go over all the logfiles to filter out the offsets and the ascii, leaving only the hex.<br />After some days i had an exact duplicate of the NAND-chip on my hard-drive.<br />Everything was unencrypted on the device, so i found the keys to decrypt the firmware updates, and the root-password to the device.</p><p>The SoC is a <span class="bbu">Lantiq GRX388</span><br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cat /proc/cpuinfo
