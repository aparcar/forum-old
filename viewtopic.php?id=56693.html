					<p>Is anyone using openwrt on openvz?&nbsp; I can get an openwrt container started, but it has no network.</p><p>I used these instructions:<br /><a href="https://github.com/zoobab/openwrt-openvz">https://github.com/zoobab/openwrt-openvz</a></p><p>I used this openwrt build:&nbsp; BARRIER BREAKER (14.07, r42625)<br />openwrt-x86-generic-Generic-rootfs.tar.gz</p><p>I previously got an openwrt openvz container with internet access, which makes me think that the latest build is fixable.<br />The older build that worked was:&nbsp; BARRIER BREAKER (Bleeding Edge, r34054)</p><p>The kernel I&#039;m using is 2.6.32-26-pve.&nbsp; It comes with Proxmox 2.1<br />I wonder if the latest openwrt requires a newer kernel.<br />Is there a reason why I should not run openwrt with another kernel?</p>									</div>

					<p>I tried the official 12.09 openwrt and it works with my openvz:<br />ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT (12.09, r36088)<br />I was able to connect to the internet, update packages, connect to the luci webserver.<br />It does need the pts fix mentioned in the github instructions.<br />I also had to boot it twice in order to see the network.</p><p>I think openvz should be in the hardware list.&nbsp; It&#039;s super-fast for testing things out.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>votsalo</strong> on 7 Apr 2015, 11:25)</p>
