					<p>Hi,<br />I am trying to build OpenWrt in an environment without direct internet connection. I have completed a build ith internet connection and have copied all the packages in dl/ to a local mirror directory and has set the CONFIG_LOCALMIRROR option. Although this works for most of the packages, the packages like usign which uses git to fetch the source code is still trying to download the files from internet. The archive exists in the local mirror with proper md5 sum and version etc, still a download from internet is attempted. Is there any workaround for this? Doe the local mirror option work for all the packages?<br />Thanks and Regards,<br />Subin</p><p>Edit: I have commented out the PKG_SOURCE_PROTO:=git and replaced PKG_SOURCE_URL with some dummy URL. Now the packages are being picked from the local repository. Is this the only way to go? Or is there a cleaner method?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>subin</strong> on 29 Mar 2016, 08:58)</p>
