					<p>Dear OpenWRT Developers Team.</p><p>My name is Javier Albarracin I want to contact you and invite you to help me develop some important functions that can add to the router with the configuration options that allow it to be the first smart router to take care of our health around the world.</p><p>These functions are based on the fundamentals of a research thesis that I am conducting in the completion of my studies as a Lic. in Systems at Kennedy University, Argentina.</p><p>I call on all developers who have the interest to face this great challenge but very beneficial for the entire world community, to contact me to start this project together and bring it to reality.</p><p><strong>&quot;A small change can bring great results.&quot; </strong> By Edward Norton Lorenz</p>									</div>
