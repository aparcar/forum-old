					<p>Hi Everybody,<br />I have installed OpenWRT on my TP-Link WR1043ND and configured the router to the &quot;routed client&quot; explained in the OpenWRT Wiki <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedclient#using.masquerade">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/rou â€¦ masquerade</a><br />Now I also have a OpenVPN server running on the Router configured after this tutorial: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.openvpn">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.openvpn</a></p><p>When I now connect a device to a LAN port I get an IP address in the space of 192.168.1.xx and can browse the web, everything works as it should. And when I start the VPN client on my Laptop, a tap0 device appears and I also get an IP address in the right address space (also 192.168.1.xx). I can also ping from/to alll devices in the LAN.</p><p>But the one thing that&#039;s not working is the Internet connection on the &quot;tunneled device&quot;, when I try to ping someone from the tunneled client, like &#039;ping 8.8.8.8 -I tap0&#039; it isn&#039;t working.</p><p>I think it&#039;s just a simple firewall rule? Can someone point me in the right direction.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p><p>Cheers,<br />Jester</p>									</div>
