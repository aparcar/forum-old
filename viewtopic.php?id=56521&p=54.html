(I have not found it yet)&nbsp; If not, then should one be created? </p><p>A checklist..&nbsp; <br />What about an automatic checklist that uses the ToH itself.<br />If a device <br />- has a supported SoC<br />- enough RAM<br />- enough ROM<br />- and all other criteria...</p><p>Then flag it as Possible to support.&nbsp; </p><p>This way we would have to fill out the ToH, the flag can not be forgotten by accident, we don&#039;t have to check manually, etc.</p><p>I had a look at the Bootlog and how the ROM is organised. and wondered if it would be an idea to also add some of that data to the ToH.&nbsp; If there is some kind of pattern in this data, that would make it also easy to check and compare this data.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure if all devices that use the same ROM have a similair structure or not, or if there are other things in the configuration that are identical.

You don&#039;t want to do this, unless you only have one single page to edit (or unless you are impatient like me and can not wait for a bug in a &#039;move&#039; plugin to be fixed ;-).<br />2) via admin: there are some move plugins, doing the above link adjustment automatically.</p><br /><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>2) Device Page<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - may contain links to media files<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - may use/present data from Data Entry</p></blockquote></div><p>Moving media around and renaming it is no problem for devicepages: Links are automagically adapted by the &quot;move&quot; plugin. In dataentries however, links to images may need manual rework.<br />The same applies for moving devicepages: Links are automatically adapter, except maybe in dataentries.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>3) Data Entry<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - contains link to media files<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - contains link to Device Page</p><p>I think it is rather important that device models and page names are consistent within a brand. I think looking for consistency between brands is unrealistic.</p></blockquote></div><p>Consistency is nice, and wherever possible dataentry and devicepage should have consistent naming. However, it&#039;s currently not my top priority. When I stumble upon inconsistencies, I try to clean them up (e.g. yesterday: we had two namespaces, &#039;gl-inet&#039; and &#039;gl.inet&#039;), but I&#039;m not searching for them.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>I cleaned up the Pogoplug devices (just the Media files the Data Entries) a little while ago. I just changed the model names, but now they are not consistent with the page names. Renaming also the pages would make it cleaner.</p></blockquote></div><p>I&#039;ll take a look at that, although I&#039;m not looking forward to do so, due to the wonderfully confusing naming scheme of pogoplugs.</p><p>My scheme for renaming media:</p><p>- Use &#039;-&#039; within the model name (TL-MR3020)<br />- Use &#039;_&#039; to separate model name from description (TL-MR320_case.jpg)<br />- Within the descriptive part, use &#039;-&#039; and &#039;_&#039; as you like. Some devices use &#039;-&#039;, some use &#039;_&#039; in the description, and I wasn&#039;t up for correcting this minor issue.<br />- Use only model name, leave out Brand (ie. &quot;tl-mr3020.jpg&quot; i/o &quot;tp-link_tl-mr3020.jpg&quot;). If images are nicely sorted into :media:[brand], this helps keeping the links short and avoids redundancies.<br />Again, I wasn&#039;t too eager to get 100% consistency here, especially between brands. Some images still have brand and model in the name, while others only have the model in. It depends on both brand and model: TP-Link doesn&#039;t need the brand in the media&#039;s name, since their naming scheme is mostly unique and easily recognizable (TL-.....). On the other hand, there are models like &quot;7001&quot;. I don&#039;t like names with numbers only, since I have seen too many of them (img00203.jpg) leaving me clueless which brand/model this image was about. I don&#039;t mind having the brand in the name in this case.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks,&nbsp; </p><p>The devil is in the details. I wish i could have done more (my 3G connection is extremely slow at the moment)<br />5000+ edits is indeed a huge number.&nbsp; </p><p>For potential new brandnames ant model numbers it might be an idea to put a bit of a structure in place. <br />I think the media directory structure is key here. Looking at the structure (or absence of structure in some cases)<br />is partly the cause of the number of edits.&nbsp; If i had realised sooner how that worked i could have saved tmo a lot of work.&nbsp; A lot of brands don&#039;t have the model types in subfolders, growing pains i guess. Form now on i will take extra care to do this better, and i hope other newbies will not make the same mistake like me.&nbsp; <br />I think tmo&#039;s &#039;Grundlichkeit&#039; is helping a big deal here.&nbsp; </p><p>I&#039;m a good example of a bad example. :-) There should be a structure in place that prevents people like me from causing chaos. Some things i just did not see when i got started, so that ignorance caused a bit of chaos. I could have asked more questions, but then i most likely never would have got anything done.&nbsp; </p><p>Looking back at the past weeks i can imagine that there are more people that want to help but just don&#039;t have the time to figure it all out. what do you guys think about that assumption?&nbsp; </p><p>It&#039;s good to see this wiki improve.
