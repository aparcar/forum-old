					<p>Hi there,</p><p>I have a (relatively) new <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd</a> flashed with OpenWrt Backfire 10.03.1. After a few problems getting started (see <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=36100)">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=36100)</a>, mostly everything works fine now.</p><p>Mostly means I sometimes have connection losses. And I am not sure if the MTU is the problem. I asked my provider which MTU to set in my router, but the &quot;normal&quot; hotline could not tell me. They told me I can call the technical hotline, but that&#039;s an expensive service phone number (â‚¬ 2,50 / minute).</p><p>Anyway ... why is ist mandatory to specify an MTU override size in Network-&gt;Interfaces-&gt;WAN-&gt;Advanced settings ?<br />The default value is 1500.<br />When I try to empty the input field, it gets back filled with the old value as soon as I leave it.</p><p>I understand that the SoC in my router does not support MTUs &gt; 1500. But what if my provider&#039;s MTU is smaller (e.g.1492) ?</p><p>My router is configured as DHCP client. The provider is a cable TV, phone, and internet provider (triple play) named Kabel BW.<br />Is there a way (other than directly connect a PC with the cable modem) to determine the provider&#039;s MTU ? It should come with the DHCP lease. Can OpenWrt show (or better: use) the data that came with the lease from the provider ?</p><p>If not, this is my feature request: make override MTU conditional and let the router&#039;s admin specify a maximum value. Override only if the provider&#039;s MTU is larger.</p><p>Thanks and Regards,<br />Markus</p>									</div>
