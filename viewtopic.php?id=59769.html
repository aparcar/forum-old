					<p>I want to test OpenWRT&#039;s firewall settings by having myself port scanned, but one obstacle is in my way: my modem. My modem has some routing functions, including NAT, and when I do a port scan on my IP, I&#039;m really scanning my modem rather than my router. Is there a way to temporarily make the modem invisible so the scans reach my router instead?</p><p>I don&#039;t have enough experience with networking to know exactly how to achieve this. Do I place the OpenWRT router in my modem&#039;s DMZ for example?</p><p>I used to have an old modem that was completely invisible when placed in bridged mode. Even bridging my current modem doesn&#039;t achieve this same effect anymore. I think there has been some change to the way bridging mode works.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>withflair</strong> on 20 Sep 2015, 07:42)</p>
