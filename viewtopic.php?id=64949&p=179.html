					<p>something is wrong with 2.4ghz wifi. with mwlwifi from aug17 all was running fine.</p><p>My wrt1200acv1 has now an uptime of 18h and DHCP-offer packets do not reach stations on 2.4ghz AP anymore. Once a 2.4-only client wants to connect, it won&#039;t receive an IP. My macbook accepts 2.4 and 5ghz but once I disable 5ghz on the router - same story. disabling/enabling 2.4ghz AP does not resolve the issue. Only reboot.</p><p>Can someone provide an older package of mwlwifi for current davidc502 build or alternatively an older image containing the old aug17 mwlwifi driver package?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tcsoft</strong> on 1 Jan 2018, 13:23)</p>

					<p>Hi,<br />I just clean installed the lastest rango build (r5621) on my WRT3200.<br />Maybe some of you already noticed that there is a problem with ping/connect from client to client trough wlan. See <a href="https://github.com/kaloz/mwlwifi/issues/243">https://github.com/kaloz/mwlwifi/issues/243</a>.</p><p>In my case, it looks like this:<br />I have two Intel NUC with Libreelec. These are connected to the router via Wlan (one 5GHz and one 2.4 GHz). I have always done the remote control with the App Kore (Andoid 8.0 5GHz). Now it is the case that the remote control only works after rebooting the router. A few minutes later it doesn&#039;t work anymore. I can&#039;t even ping the two devices anymore. However, the two media players still work (I have another IR remote control). I can play movies and the internet connection works, too. </p><p>Does anyone know this problem?</p><p>Edit: I&#039;m coming from LEDE 17.01.4 with same issue. I didn&#039;t notice this issue in older davidc build&#039;s (november I guess)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mrremo</strong> on 2 Jan 2018, 12:12)</p>
