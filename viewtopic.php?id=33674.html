					<p>Hi, I need help with setting up my router in client mode. I am trying to do a DIY range extender with a FON-like router (it was formerly a &quot;pineapple&quot; running openwrt with jaserger) my router only has one LAN (combo WAN/LAN port) and one radio, so I was going to use a Belkin N150 router (with stock firmware) as the secondary AP. My Main AP is currently a 2WIRE supplied by AT&amp;T with no password. I need to know how to set up the router in client mode and then bridge the WLAN and LAN, also I need to have my main AP continue to provide DHCP and it should resolve the DNS 192.168.1.65. My subnet is 255.255.255.0 and IP of 192.168.1.xxx with the router at 192.168.1.254. </p><p>Also as a side note I was going to configure the MAC on the Belkin router as the same as my main AP to provide seamless transfer between access points any comments on this? </p><p>Thanks<br />Riley</p>									</div>
