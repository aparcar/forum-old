					<p>Hi everyone..<br />Straight to the point, does anyone have tried to record video that stream/recorded using webcam?<br />I&#039;m new in linux and openwrt. Currently mine is using motion and ffmpeg to capture and stream video by webcam. But unfortunately, the recorded video is laggy (because the video made by combining every screenshots that ware detected by motion ?). <br />Could it possible to record video using webcam without getting laggy ?<br />Need advise and reference <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Thankyou <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

Need advice <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />-currently i&#039;m using logitech c170. Is that sufficient for record without getting lag on recorded video?<br />-using ffmpeg, the output of video is *.avi<br />-I store the recorded video on usb stick with 4GB space<br />-Play the recorded video using samba sharing. But i also copy/paste the video in my laptop and then play it. But the result still lag, same as i play directly from samba server.<br />It seems the video quality affect the fps?</p>									</div>
