					<p>@mazilo Yes, it&#039;s true because I have created a directory /mnt. Also, I have only copied part of the whole uhttpd file.</p><p>The problem is now solved, after I have used ssh and echo scripts through the terminal instead. Just wondering why using echo to input the file will make a difference with directly entering the strings to the text file.</p>									</div>

					<p>I also created /mnt directory. I certainly would appreciate if you could provide help because I would like to implement your idea.</p>									</div>
