					<p>Hello guys,</p><p>I&#039;m quite new to OpenWrt (though I&#039;ve made this account today, I&#039;m using it for about 6-7 months, at least) and I think I&#039;ve searched the whole internet for this issue - and I could not get it fixed.. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>I&#039;m using a TP-Link TL-WR1043ND v3 and I&#039;ve installed Chaos Calmer 15.05, with LuCi WebGUI. <br />Don&#039;t know how or why, but on wireless connection every device is limited to ~20 Mbps/device. And I have no idea how to solve it... If I would have 3, 4 or 8 devices connected at once, and speed test them (or download something at the same time) all of them would reach ~20 Mbps, but not get over that speed. So, I guess it means that physically is capable of better/greater speeds.</p><p>Wireless settings are like this (it&#039;s a b/g/n 2.4 Ghz Atheros QCA9558 - with 3 antennas):<br /> - Operating frequency&nbsp; - Mode&nbsp; &quot;N&quot; (only this and &quot;Legacy&quot; are available)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Channel&nbsp; &quot;11&quot; (I have quite a few Wi-Fi APs around from my neightboors, and they<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; use some other channels - guess no need to explains this...)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Width&nbsp; &quot;40 MHz&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Transmit Power&nbsp; &quot;auto&quot;</p><br /><p>* Because I&#039;ve wanted to test a few apps (like Transmission, OpenVPN and others..) and the router&#039;s flash has not enough space, I&#039;ve bought a 2.0 16GB USB stick, and made it &quot;default flash&quot; as it runs - I guess, you might know better than me what I did here and you don&#039;t need any other details.. (though if you need it, I&#039;ll provide it - as much as I know).</p><p>* I&#039;ve installed some QoS softwares, but did not used them at all (so, no rules or other configurations were made) - I thought they would come in handy, but realised that I don&#039;t need them, so I have uninstalled them - same speed issue before and after installation.</p><p>Please help with any information or ideas you have on this! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Thanks for landing me your time on reading this - I appreciate! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, I&#039;d start by flashing most recent snapshot (<a href="https://downloads.lede-project.org/snapshots/targets/ar71xx/generic/">https://downloads.lede-project.org/snap â€¦ x/generic/</a>). You have imo the best router for openwrt, so I think it should work perfectly. I&#039;m using CC on my v2 and it works several years now with hdd attached and wifi performance is 80mbit behind one wall. Your v3 is more recent and there&#039;s a chance it was not optimized in CC (yet). If you will miss web ui, you can easily install it from command line (<a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials</a>).</p>									</div>

If that&#039;s the only chance I can get it fixed, it means I&#039;m gonna lose all my settings and have to&nbsp; configure it from scrach. I think I&#039;m gonna give it a try though in a few days so I can be free of work and have enough time for troubleshooting (in case if something goes wrong). Thanks again and have a good one!</p><br /><p>Edit #1 (Jan 17, 2018):<br />------------------------------------------<br />Updated to the last snapshot.. Unfortunately, my Wi-Fi speed limit/device it&#039;s not fixed.. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />But thank you for advice - now I know where to find latest updates. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>shk</strong> on 17 Jan 2018, 15:12)</p>
