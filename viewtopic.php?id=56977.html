					<p>Hi all</p><p>I am looking for an easy way to figure out what packages are installed into my OpenWRT host via the package system as opposed to the image install.</p><p>&quot;opkg list-installed&quot; will show me all installed packages, but there is no differentiation between packages which have been installed into the /overlay flash, RAM, or any other location.</p><p>It doesn&#039;t look like the package manager tracks this information.</p><p>It looks like the only choice I have is to search around /overlay to find out.</p><p>Does anyone have a better idea?</p><p>Use case should be pretty obvious here: User&#039;s /overlay is full. Wants to clean it up. What packages can he remove to do that?</p>									</div>
