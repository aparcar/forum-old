					<p>nyt-- I&#039;ve been doing some additional wifi testing today... you were running into the issue with disconnects most frequently under 5Ghz right? Do you have other 5Ghz routes/APs running?</p><p>I was able to reproduce the issue with both their latest official LinkSys firmware and also the latest OpenWRT image they posted (the +USB image). But what was interesting is that all the times I reproduced it today it was on 2.4GHz. No 5 (caveat I only tested for about an hour with 4 images... not a huge test base). And while traffic volume seems to cause it more frequently, it&#039;s not strictly volume... twice today it disconnected with just ping&#039;s happening.</p><p>I&#039;ve got 2 2.4GHz devices nearby... I&#039;m starting to wonder if it&#039;s some type of interference issue....</p>									</div>
