					<p>Hi,<br />If I understood correctly, I &quot;need&quot; to run kernel 2.6 in order to have 802.1X support (as a client) in wpa supplicant.<br />This means that I am basically running with the svn trunk in order to have wireless driver support.</p><p>My questions are:<br />1. Is it possible to control the wireless parameters with the 2.6 driver (rx antenna, tx antenna and diversity) - if yes, how???<br />2. Does diversity work at all with this unit? (with 2.6 kernel or with the &quot;original drivers&quot; in the 2.4 kernel)<br />3. Is it possible to run wpa_supplicant with 802.1X support in kernel 2.4?</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p><p>Alfred (alf).</p>									</div>

The driver will enable automatic diversity by itself. There are some defines in the driver that can be changed you want to force a desired antenna, not sure if it works.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>alfred_m wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>2.

I remember playing with the antenna selection in White Russian, so it probably worked in 2.4 (I&#039;m not completely sure about this... it was easier to just solder out the diversity chip <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />)</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>alfred_m wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>3.

Also keep in mind that the original 2.4 driver was somewhat unstable in client configurations.</p>									</div>
