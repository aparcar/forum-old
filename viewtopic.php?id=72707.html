					<p>I have an ASUS RT-N14U router. According to the documentation it is fully supported, and clear installation instructions are found on the OpenWrt site. However, I didn&#039;t manage to install OpenWrt using any of the described methods: not using TFTP, not using ASUS&#039; Firmware Restore Tool, and not by uploading a .trx file through the web interface (the last one was the Padavan firmware, not provided for OpenWrt). </p><p>None of these methods worked for me. </p><p>For the first two methods (supported according to this site) I have to connect my computer to my router. The router has a WAN port with an RJ14 connector (I think, it is the same as a telephone connector) and 4 LAN ports with a standard network connector, which I think is called RJ45. I can only connect a physical cable to the LAN ports. For the TFTP method (setting the PC&#039;s IP to the value specified in the documentation) it simply gives me a &quot;Transfer timed out&quot;. With the windows Firmware Restore utility it only seems to upload anything when I use LAN port 4 (the others don&#039;t work), and on this port 4 it seems to upload correctly, then install, but finally it fails anyway. After that, the original firmware seems to be unaltered.</p><p>For method 2 in the OpenWrt documentation it says to connect to the WAN port (in the ASUS documentation and in the description of method 1 it doesn&#039;t). However, due to the format of the socket I cannot connect to it. Is there a way that I could (e.g. with a specially prepared cable)? Would this be the reason I don&#039;t manage to load the OpenWrt firmware, or should it have worked with a LAN port as well?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

Similar in name and shape, but internally a completely different device and, as far as I can tell, currently not supported by OpenWrt/LEDE.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 5 Dec 2017, 20:19)</p>
