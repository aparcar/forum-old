Then I&#039;d suggest to always create the mounting points menu item and show some warning that some additional action are needed if no block-mount is installed like network interface page suggests to install comgt if 3g functionality is needed. Otherwise one would always think that something is broken with the current build because the user interface has been changed without a single warning. </p><p>BTW one could mount a remote file system like cifs even without usb or mmc.</p>									</div>

					<p>after installing block-mount the luci shows the menu item. But I still have problems to make it working. The changes I made using the mount points page aren&#039;t executed. At least there are not /tmp/fstab created out of the /etc/config/fstab. Do I miss something?</p><p>Another question - how can I use uuid instead of the device name?</p>									</div>

					<p>I had the same problem. It drove me crazy.&nbsp; Check if there is /tmp/fstab and if it is populated as intended in your /etc/config/fstab. IF yes, and if you have a /etc/fstab, too, THEN we both have been antagonize by the same bug:</p><p>Try vim /etc/init.d/fstab&nbsp; and put a # in front of the line echo &#039;# WARNING: this is an auto generated file, please use uci to set defined filesystems&#039; &gt; /etc/fstab.</p><p>This line creates the file /etc/fstab and thus prevents creating a symlink to /tmp/fstab. In order for uci to work, there need to be symlink instead of the file!</p><p>I already put this info into the wiki:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/fstab">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/fstab</a></p><p>It is a real pain in the ass to find something in this forum...</p>									</div>

The symlink exists just after the installation of an image. The script in the init.d will use this symlink to update the file in the /tmp which is correct.
