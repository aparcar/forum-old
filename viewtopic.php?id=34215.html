					<p>the normal wifi is bridged to lan (eth0.1 = Vlan1 = the 4 LAN-Ports) this is done by &quot;option network lan&quot; in /etc/config/wireless. So there is no routing going on it&#039;s just bridged on layer2.</p><p>So I&#039;m not quite sure what do you want to achieve. <br />If you bridge your guest-wlan to your lan or enable routing without any restriction (firewall) there really is no point in having a guest-wlan. </p><p>If the guest should only be able to reach some IPs or services you need a firewall. </p><p>And I guess the routing isn&#039;t working because the clients in your lan (192.168.1.x) don&#039;t know how to reach the subnet 192.168.190.x <br />Your main router is 192.168.1.4 and I guess this is the default gateway of the clients on your lan, so the clients need a static route to 192.168.190.x you can add it manually on the client or push it with the dhcp-reponse. Or you could set up masquerading between guest and lan (so the guests could reach the lan but not the other way around) </p><p>If the server for the guest is a different server (192.168.190.4) and you want to separate it completly from your lan, you could setup up another VLAN and assign one lan-port to it, connect the server to this port and bridge the guest-wifi to this vlan. </p><p>I guess you should think about what do you really want to achieve, and discribe your setup in more detail. Is this one server for lan and guest, does it have 1 or 2 ethernetports. What should be reachable for the guests,...&nbsp; And how is your lan setup. what does 192.168.1.4 and what 192.168.1.153, which one is the dhcp-server. ...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 21 Jan 2012, 13:30)</p>

					<p>Ok, now I get it. But you are thinking too complicated. </p><p>just leave your current network config as it is. wlan bridged to &quot;lan&quot; and guest-wlan not bridged to anything. <br />use only 192.168.1.4 on the server, remove 192.168.190.4. Reenable the firewall and add this to /etc/config/firewall : <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;zone&#039;
        option &#039;name&#039; &#039;guest&#039;
        option &#039;input&#039; &#039;ACCEPT&#039;
        option &#039;output&#039; &#039;ACCEPT&#039;
        option &#039;forward&#039; &#039;REJECT&#039;

config &#039;forwarding&#039;            
        option &#039;src&#039; &#039;guest&#039;      
        option &#039;dest&#039; &#039;lan&#039;

config &#039;forwarding&#039;            
        option &#039;src&#039; &#039;lan&#039;      
        option &#039;dest&#039; &#039;guest&#039;</code></pre></div><p>this way you allow routing between lan and guest-wlan.&nbsp; So you should be able to pass packets between lan and guest-wlan. But the clients on &quot;lan&quot; need to know how to reach the guest-wlan subnet (192.168.190.x) so you have to add a static route with 192.168.1.153 as gateway for subnet 192.168.190.0/24), at least on the server (or you can configure the dhcp-server on lan to push it to all clients). If you do this you should be able to reach the server from the guest-wlan on it&#039;s lan-ip (192.168.1.4). </p><p>if this is working you can configure the firewall to restrict traffic only to the server, or even only special ports on the server. This way you will have a secure setup without the danger of bypassing your firewall with your &quot;multi-homed&quot;-server, the need of bridging lan and the guest-wlan or an complicated (and probably unsecure) vlan-setup.</p><p>replace the settings above with something like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;zone&#039;
        option &#039;name&#039; &#039;guest&#039;
        option &#039;input&#039; &#039;ACCEPT&#039;
