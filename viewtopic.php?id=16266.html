					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I need to use a very particular version of madwifi (madwifi-old-r1417-20060128) which is patched for several experimenting purposes. The targets are Asus WL 500G Premium routers. I tried to create my own kernel package by reusing a modified version of the Makefile of the madwifi version provided with OpenWrt (r3314). I mainly changed the name of the package (I use a slightly different name), some make options according to my needs, the source of the package (I now only use my own tar.gz file) and my Makefile don&#039;t call make modules anymore, since this section doesn&#039;t seems to exist in the old madwifi&#039;s Makefile. Additionally, I renamed the patch files folder, in order not to use them.</p><p>My problem is that as soon as it begins to try compile the first file, I have errors like :</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ah_osdep.c:44:26: linux/config.h: No such file or directory
ah_osdep.c:45:27: linux/version.h: No such file or directory
ah_osdep.c:46:26: linux/module.h: No such file or directory
ah_osdep.c:47:24: linux/init.h: No such file or directory
ah_osdep.c:49:26: linux/kernel.h: No such file or directory
...</code></pre></div><p>Which seems to indicate that something is wrong with the path of the kernel sources (which is supposed to be the same as in the legacy version of madwifi).</p><p>Does anyone has an idea about that?<br />I&#039;m quite new with OpenWrt so it may be very stupid...</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks.<br />I tried to use your package instead, but it does not seem to be ok with my sources. I even get an &#039;unrecognized option -EL&#039; error :</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mipsel-linux-uclibc-gcc: unrecognized option `-EL&#039;
