					<p>Hi,</p><p>I compiled a new openwrt (experimental) firmware for my wrt54gs with a kernel with mutlicast and <br />multicast routing support and tried to make mrouted running. After twitching a little <br />bit in the source code it compiles and _seems_ to work, but actually it does <br />not route. The correct igmpv2 queries and answers are sent/received, but the multicast<br />packages are not forwarded even if the usual cirteria for routing are fullfilled (a listener in one network, <br />a sender in the other, ttl &gt; 1). </p><p>Has anyone had success with mrouted?</p><p>I&#039;ve experienced endianess problems in mrouted and also experienced some in the &quot;original&quot; openwrt <br />packages(e.g. the ping in the openwrt busybox sends seq no. 0, 256, 512 ...&nbsp; if watched with tcpdump <br />from another machine). Is there something special with the mips CPU in the linksys?</p><p>Regards,</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Carsten</p>									</div>

					<p>i have also endless problems with linux multicast routing support. Not only with OpenWrt, but also with Coyote based self made router software (x86). Mrouted itself is from year 1998, latest patches by Debian at year 2001 and thats all. My previous router software with 2.2.x kernel was working perfectly for several years, but with 2.4.x no luck at all. I think, there is some conflicts with multicast routing and other stuff in kernel. Some kernel versions with some configurations works, but most does not. The symptoms is like yours. Mrouted compile and run neatly, all igmp stuff works, and even proper lines appears to file /proc/net/ip_mr_cache , but no multicast packets forwarded. All counters remains zero. Linux kernel multicast routing urgently needs maintainer.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>netmaster</strong> on 3 Jul 2005, 20:52)</p>
