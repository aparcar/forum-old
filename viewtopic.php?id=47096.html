					<p>Hi, i have a D-link dir-615 E1 and i decided to do the usb hack but pictures in the wiki are little&nbsp; different from my pcb, even i soldered the resistors like the picture 15 k ohm and 220 ohm,i just need to put the 5 V but i don&#039;t know where to take it , should i just measure it or what should i do ?<br />here is some pictures of my pcb.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc3/1425365_10152029413126528_1149393803_o.jpg" alt="dir-615 e1 pcb" /></span><br /><span class="postimg"><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/1399173_10152029412716528_777197131_o.jpg" alt="dir-615 e1 pcb" /></span><br /><span class="postimg"><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/860958_10152029414791528_1368633870_o.jpg" alt="dir-615 e1 pcb" /></span><br /><span class="postimg"><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/r270/1401192_10152029415276528_2105521724_o.jpg" alt="dir-615 e1 pcb" /></span><br /><span class="postimg"><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/r270/906783_10152029413246528_1215949862_o.jpg" alt="dir-615 e1 pcb" /></span></p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve done the USB modification to this router.</p><p>That is a hellish mess of SMD resistors.&nbsp; You don&#039;t actually need to pull those lines up and down; the CPU does that for you.&nbsp; Just put in the two series 22 ohm resistors on each line.</p><p>You may get power from one side of the 0-ohm link R185 or a bunch of other places in that general area.</p><p>Shattering your expectations:&nbsp; The CPU in this router only has USB 1.1.&nbsp; A little extra /overlay space or some network printing is fine, but don&#039;t expect to run a file server off this thing.&nbsp; Even a cellular modem is a stretch, unless you&#039;re on a really crappy plan.</p><p>Keep in mind that the 1.2 amp power supply and the onboard fuse shipped with the unit will probably not have enough headroom for powering much more than a USB flash drive (100-200 mA) with a combined heavy CPU, radio, and switch load.&nbsp; A powered hub is advisable for heavy loads like hard drives or multiple USB devices.</p><p>Also keep in mind that part of the unpopulated area is a filter for keeping noise/interference out of the 5v supply, which is necessary for keeping the USB device from being susceptible to strong external interference, and to prevent the USB devices from conducting emissions back out the DC cable (acting as an antenna).&nbsp; Installing USB without installing these parts could violate local regulations regarding unintentional emitters of RF energy by conduction over power lines (though you&#039;re unlikely to be harassed).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>matthewr21</strong> on 4 Nov 2013, 19:37)</p>

					<p>I know this is late, but I had the same model router and with a poorly shielded USB cable I would get the debounce error.&nbsp; Try reinstalling a properly shielded cable -- I just buy an extension cable and cut it 6 inches from the end.</p>									</div>
