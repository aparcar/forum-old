					<p>I have a question about the fix in OpenWRT. Does the fix implement, that if used as an AP, the AP disconnects a &quot;broken&quot; client, if it notices, a client uses an all 0 key (something like &quot;0000...&quot;? Or what does:</p><p>0004-Prevent-installation-of-an-all-zero-TK.patch</p><p>mean? So, doesnt this meaning, it is only necessary to have a proper / patched AP, instead of needing all Clients to have patches too?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makedir</strong> on 22 Oct 2017, 13:23)</p>

					<p>In the newly built wpad - it appears it doesn&#039;t have the changes discussed at hxxps://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/commit/?id=6f234c1e2ee1ede29f2412b7012b3345ed8e52d3 - but that is based on running &#039;strings(1)&#039; against the binary and looking for the text for the os_strcmp(...) calls...<br />Question for @wigyori -- do you have plans to include that sort of functionality?&nbsp; I&#039;d love to have the AP protect the client as I intuit that there will be unpatched clients &quot;forever&quot; ...

					<p>I&#039;m not sure who did the fixes, but I find that the router I upgraded fully today has the EAPOL no-retransmit option in the &quot;wireless&quot; -&gt; &quot;security&quot; options - well done - whoever did that (i&#039;m on bleeding edge) - the build I note this on is 50130. I however was able to also upgrade luci on an older unit with 49933 and get the same option available there.</p><p>@shockedquartz - not sure what you mean by abandoned - check whether &quot;trunk&quot; can be used on your router, and update to that - there&#039;s unfortunate confusion about the discussion between two slightly different versions of openwrt, but the simple approach is to try not to be affected by that and stick with the basics...</p><p>OpenWRT has an, in my opinion, excellent rate of bug fixes - including the last SAMBA issue, the DNSMASQ issues, and now this KRACK issue.&nbsp; The &quot;secret&quot; is to not think you have to be wedded to the older stable releases.&nbsp; I have a couple of really old WRT54G&#039;s with BB that are in a plastic bag waiting until I have time to either recycle them or update them. They surely don&#039;t belong in use, as several have noted - BB isn&#039;t getting updates and hasn&#039;t for a long time.</p><p>This shouldn&#039;t be a surprise, and it&#039;s way better than major software vendors near redmond or major hardware / driver vendors near hillsboro - they obsolete s/w and h/w about the day after you first get it :-)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tom_wlan_2016</strong> on 25 Oct 2017, 06:01)</p>

					<p>Hi, I am running Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 (r49261) on a TP-Link Archer C7 v2. It&#039;s working so good, it&#039;s a little miracle <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> and I spent quite a lot of time configuring the fine details (I have a somewhat complex home network).</p><p>So, now I would like to patch it against KRACK with the least effort possible, and possibly without switching to LEDE which, as I understand, will be rebranded &quot;OpenWRT&quot; soon anyway. Is there a patched OpenWRT build out there already?

					<p>@gaglia83, i think, you can use your configuration with LEDE successfully. If you change any config files outside /etc/config, backup the files manually.</p>									</div>

There have been changes to LED, VLAN etc. definitions in between, so especially /etc/config/system and /etc/config/network can be problematic. Better to sysupgrade to default settings and manually edit/import most other config files. It is possible that the current settings work ok, but that does not hold true for all router models.</p><p>(Latest buildbot snapshot of Openwrt is mainly the April 2016 code plus some security fix backports. CC15.05 is mainly the May 2015 code plus some security backports.)</p>									</div>
