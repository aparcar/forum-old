					<p>i agree with you that there are certain standard packages that it may make sense to include by default.&nbsp; i would include dropbear and also pppoe among these.</p><p>as for your second question, i recommend putting everything, including scripts, in packages/wifidog.&nbsp; it will make upgrades to interface-wrt less likely to break what you have done.</p>									</div>

					<p>I builded a package for Wifidog in the packages directory. When I want to submit my configuration, index.sh can not easily handle the data.</p><p>My first try was that : I set subsection=wifidog_set in the <strong>form</strong>, the file will be out of the wifidog in /www/openwrt/packages/wifidog_set and all will work as expected.&nbsp; But this is not really usefull for single dir package files add-on. </p><p>So I did some modification to index.sh : I added <strong>read STDIN</strong> in the file and modified this code :<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[...]
if [ &quot;$section&quot; = &quot;packages&quot; ] &amp;&amp; [ -d $pkg_dir/$subsection ]; then
        if [ &quot;$(post_var submit)&quot; = &quot;Apply+Changes&quot; ]; then
                . &quot;$section/$subsection/submit&quot;
        else
                . &quot;$section/$subsection/index&quot;
        fi
else
        . &quot;$section/$subsection&quot;
fi
[...]</code></pre></div><p>and added the name field for the submit button to my script of wifidog :</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Apply Changes&quot; class=&quot;submit&quot; name=&quot;submit&quot; /&gt;</code></pre></div><p>With this code if the <strong>submit button</strong> is defined by <strong>Apply Changes</strong>, the <strong>submit</strong> file is sourced instead of the <strong>index</strong> file.</p><p>What do you think of my modifications ?</p><p>And I want to know why you are not reading <strong>STDIN</strong> in index.sh and remove all <strong>read STDIN</strong> of the beginning of all submit files ? I did not read all the script and I want to know if I am not breaking some code or going in futur design trouble.</p><p>Many scripts did no data input validation. What is the best, javascript validation before submitting data or shell validation before doing any modifications ?</p><p>Also, If some people ask for small documentation I can write something. It&#039;s easy to understand how all things work, but it will provide rapid overview and standard code creation and validation.</p><p>I take a look of the needs of Ile Sans Fil and I will had support for :<br /> - httpd : done, need some minor changes before releasing code<br /> - ez-ipupdate (package) : In progress<br /> - rdate : In progress<br /> - Wifidog (package) : Basic config done and tested<br /> - pppoe : To do<br /> - Maybe some basic support for openvpn (package)</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

I&#039;m looking for a way to have a presentation code file and a submission code file easily handle by the web interface. And all the files must go in /www/openwrt/packages/myNewPackage.
