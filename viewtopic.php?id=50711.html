					<p>Hello guys,<br />I hope some geek will see this and come back to me...</p><p>I got a very cheap unit as mentioned above, and mangled with it. I tried both debian and ubuntu on it with much success, but the cpu of this model is capped at 400 MHz. This is causing a very annoying 5 Mb/s write rate while using raid-5. </p><p>I wonder if it is possible to set the cpu speed to the 600MHz as the 80219 it is using clearly supports this speed. <br />After carefully reading <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/evaluation.boards/pb44#overclocking">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/evaluation. â€¦ erclocking</a> - it came clear to me that this is totally doable through RedBoot, providing I know&nbsp; the registers that control the cpu settings. Can any of you hackers tell me a way to find those registers ? Is there a way to debug or disassemble the redboot image I copied from my unit ?</p><p>Intel has given out the a bunch of source code for that model but not the redboot part</p>									</div>
