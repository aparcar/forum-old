					<p>I want to build a router that displays current throughput for each interface (primary goal), SNR, load, uptime, and other statistics via either a graphical or character-based LCD display.</p><p>My initial thought was that OpenWRT may be able to drive a <a href="http://www.crystalfontz.com/">CrystalFontz</a> or similar serial LCD directly through a router&#039;s serial port.</p><p>The PalmOrb project looks quite interesting, as well, and has been implemented with a WL-500GP using Oleg&#039;s Firmware (<a href="http://digiland.tw/viewtopic.php?id=494">original</a>, <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=1&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fdigiland.tw%2Fviewtopic.php%3Fid%3D494&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en">english translation</a>).&nbsp; PalmOrb is also mentioned on this forum <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=34427">here</a> and <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=18490">here</a>.</p><p>Another option would be to connect an Arduino board via USB or serial and have that control the LCD.&nbsp; <a href="http://blog.fupps.com/2009/05/11/naguino-an-arduino-based-lcd-monitor-for-nagios-and-icinga/">Here&#039;s a project for Nagios monitoring on Arduino</a>, for reference.</p><p>I&#039;m pretty flexible as to what router I run this off of.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got a WRT54G v3, a Fonera 2100, and an Asus WL-520Gu.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t mind acquiring something better for this purpose, either, like a <a href="http://www.ubnt.com/products/rspro.php">RouterStation Pro</a> or an <a href="http://www.pcengines.ch/alix.htm">ALIX</a>, either of which would give me the flexibility of having both USB and serial ports onboard.</p><p>Any thoughts or suggestions on how to embark on this project?&nbsp; Has anyone been successful with this on OpenWRT?</p>									</div>

					<p>If you have usb, there&#039;s no need for the arduino--just go straight through USB serial to the LCD (as here: <a href="http://www.1strecon.org/TheShoppe/k107/bundles.shtml">http://www.1strecon.org/TheShoppe/k107/bundles.shtml</a> or here: <a href="http://www.phanderson.com/picaxe/">http://www.phanderson.com/picaxe/</a> (LCD117))</p><p>The WL-520gU should handle this with no strain.&nbsp; This USB-RS232 dongle from ebay is suitable: <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/USB-to-RS232-Ser...item414955d103">http://cgi.ebay.com/USB-to-RS232-Ser...item414955d103</a> ($2.38 with shipping).</p><p>My personal preference would be to put it on a web page, but I guess it can be nice to have something to glance at when you walk by.</p><p>Edit: the phanderson product is a kit and would require level-shifting to use with USB-serial; the wulfden board has a jumper to select between ttl levels and rs232.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lizby</strong> on 14 Jan 2010, 13:24)</p>

					<p>The Wulfden K107 kit supports rs232 voltage levels and 5v ttl levels (with a jumper).&nbsp; It connects to HD44780 parallel LCDs (the firmware uses &quot;nibble&quot; mode--4-bit data.&nbsp; You can take 5v or 3.3v out of the router--the switching power plug gives a good 5v, and you can take it by soldering right to the pins of the power input jack.&nbsp; 3v3 is easiest to get from the internal serial 4-pin position.&nbsp; When you use the USB-serial dongle, there is no 3.3v vs 5v issue.&nbsp; The internal 3.3v logic-level serial can be disconnected from the console, but at a stage in the boot process where a lot of text has already been output at a baud rate of 115200--I don&#039;t know if you&#039;d want that scrolling across your LCD.&nbsp; </p><p>A &quot;serial&quot; lcd might well be logic-level.&nbsp; If it were, then you would need to shift from an rs232 dongle down to the level required.</p>									</div>

					<p>@JimWright: kmod-usb-video is needed for support of webcams.&nbsp; Whether it provides functionality for outputting video, I don&#039;t know--as you say, no working results visible.&nbsp; openWrt is not geared towards video out--I don&#039;t know if even people using the alix boards or other x86 are doing anything other than using openWrt &quot;headless&quot;.</p>									</div>
