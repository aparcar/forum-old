					<p>Hello Folks,<br />i have few WLA-G54C Buffalo APs laying around and i would like to resurrect them with Kamikaze or WhiteRussian for some electronic projects i have. In the past they were quite popular APs, i have flashed them a lot of times and they worked fine. Now for an electronic project i would like to know available GPIOs on these machines, in the past i had few html pages and links about that but now i totally lost these information.<br />is there someone who can address me to WLA-G54 (C,C2, models...) GPIOs schematics ?<br />I had schemas form each buffalo AP except these WLA machines, is there someone using or having these ? i have even tried to gooogling around, look at DD-WRT pages and so on but no results seems to be available. Anyone help ?</p><p>It would be appreciated<br />Regards</p><p>Andrea (Ben) Benini</p>									</div>
