					<p>What do you mean by software architecture?<br />I think that a source code does not have an architecture, it is compiled for a specific hardware architecture.<br />OpenWrt can be compiled to different architectures according to the hardware you have, and that&#039;s why there is no architecture mentioned in the wiki.</p>									</div>
