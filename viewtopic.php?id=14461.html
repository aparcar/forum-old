					<p>(Tried posting on the X-Wrt forum, but got little response)</p><p>I am new to openwrt. Tried to search on the web, but found little related info. Here is what happened:</p><p>I grab the following image file here:<br /><a href="http://downloads.x-wrt.org/xwrt/kamikaze/snapshots/rcd321x-2.6/openwrt-rdc-squashfs-ar525w-web.img">http://downloads.x-wrt.org/xwrt/kamikaz … 5w-web.img</a><br />and update my Airlink101 ar525w router using web interface. After the route rebooted, my PC could not get any ip address. I configured static IP address of 192.168.1.100 on the PC, and tried ping 192.168.1.1, no response. Seems none of the dhcp, tftp, http was working. I then power cycled the router, when it powered up, the wlan light never lighted up, the DMZ light stayed on for a minute also and went off. The power light and the LAN port light which my PC connected to remained on. Yet I could not in any way to connect to the router.</p><p>Did I miss something in the process? Is it bricked? How can I recover it?</p><p>Thanks for any help! I am desperate!</p>									</div>

					<p>I think the best would be to connect a serial console to the router.&nbsp; Then you should be able to see what&#039;s going on.</p><p>See these for more details:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Airlink101/AR525W">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har … 101/AR525W</a><br /><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=58154#p58154">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=58154#p58154</a></p>									</div>
