					<p>Hi,<br />I ve Tp-Link Wr841N (V8.3) and im using as subject says OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment 12.09-beta2 Luci&#039;s.</p><p>My question is ; My modem use 1st channel but i wanted to change it to 9 (doesnt matter which channel) it changes correctly but when i wish to make a wireless bridge with wr841n every 5 sec the connection between modem and router down. i dont know why. i tried all channels but nothing. if i turn back to 1st channel then there is no problem.</p><p>other symptom is ; near my home there is a wireless without password and it works good ( direct connect from my laptop and that wireless) but i dont want to use it (so not mine, its not correct <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> (im a good guy <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /> ) ) but i wanted to try it with my wr841n.. when i scan and join that wireless network if i dont add another wifi (wireless bridge) it stays stabile (but still no internet even via ethernet cable) but when i add a wifi , my wifi or that wifi goes to disable. (one of them certainly goes to disable.)</p><p>What should i do ? or where i m wrong ?</p><p>Op System : windows 8<br />R : Tp-link wr841n (v 8.3)<br />R System :OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment 12.09-beta2</p><br /><br /><p>thank you</p>									</div>
