					<p>Hi all,</p><p>Set-up:</p><p>ASRock ION330HT <br />- Cisco/Linksys WUSB600N v2 USB wireless adapter, Ralink rt3572<br />- Linux Ubuntu 10.10<br />- kernel 2.6.32-23 with Ralink driver (version 2.5?)<br />- wpa_supplicant using wext driver</p><p>D-Link DIR-825, OpenWRT</p><p>Dell Precision M4500, Intel 6200 AGN wireless adapter, XP SP3</p><p>The router is running with 2 both radios on, one SSID on 2.4GHz, another on 5GHz (channel 36). The ASRock is connected via channel 36 to the router. The laptop is connected on the same channel 36, no other device is connected to the router on the 5GHz band. The ASRock is around 4 meters away from the router, the laptop about 2 meters. Both of them show that they are connected at 300Mbit/sec</p><p>I&#039;m getting really slow transfer rates between the laptop and the ASRock (my XBMC media centre btw). I&#039;m talking 2.5MB/sec *max*. I&#039;ve tested this transfer speed both using an SMB mount between windows and Linux (samba) as well as using plain simple FTP.</p><p>In order to eliminate the laptop from the equation, I&#039;ve added a USB flashdrive to the router, and done an SFTP from the Linux box to the router. Same results with respect to the transfer speed: somewhere between 1.5 and 2.5 MB/sec on average. Will probably retest that tonight with a USB HDD that&#039;s known to perform well, to rule out any slow-down due to the flashdrive.</p><p>So thes transfer rates are really disappointing... to be honest I&#039;m hoping for something in the range of 50-60MB/sec, and based on a few google searches I believe that that is possible with wireless-N@300Mbit/sec connections.</p><p>Does anybody have any ideas about:<br />- is this a hardware limitation somewhere?<br />- is this a software limitation?<br />- is this misconfiguration? If so, is there any configuration information I can supply that would help analyze this? I can post more details tonight if requested.</p><p>Kind regards, Maarten</p><p>ps. as a comparison, previously I used the internal Atheros wireless card in the ASRock on the 2.4GHz band, I think it connected at 150Mbit/sec, and I got transfer rates on that of under 1MB/sec....</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>As an update to this, at the following link you&#039;ll see mention of transfer rates of around 70MB/sec with the DIR-825. That&#039;s with the stock D-Link firmware of course (or at least I assume).</p><p>To rule out the possibility that my test with FTP between Laptop&lt;-&gt;router and linux&lt;-&gt;router was held back by a slow flashdrive on the router, , I have tested with a HDD drive (freshly formatted) instead of the flash drive, and performance is still horrible.</p><p>To rule out the possibility that the linux box is the bottleneck, I&#039;ve also tested with another laptop, and between 2 windows laptops using FTP (eg not involving the linux box at all), and still horrible performance.</p><p>Although to me this all points to an issue with the router, I&#039;m not sure yet if I&#039;m willing to flash the stock dlink firmware back to test if the problem is in openwrt... I kinda like my current openwrt setup (it&#039;s not possible to make a &quot;re-flashable&quot; backup of my entire openwrt installation, is it?)</p><p>Regards, Maarten</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I switched back to the D-Link firmware (version 205, NA version cos the newest WW version I could find was 201 only). Transfer speeds are spotty, but definitely higher than before. Using FTP I can get sometimes over 5MBytes/sec, so over 40Mbit/s, but it swings wildly. iperf usually reports transfer rates around 23Mbit/sec,</p><p>So, for now I&#039;ll stick with the stock firmware, but I do miss NAT loopback <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>Btw. I also tried to get dd-wrt running, but couldn&#039;t get any of my wireless clients to obtain an IP address, although they did associate with the AP. Wrong forum to mention I suppose <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Rgds</p>									</div>
