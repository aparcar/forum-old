I&#039;m not able to establish connection using this version. But if I download the chaos_calmer branch, openwrt is built with 3.18 kernel and older version Bluetooth_6lowpan kernel module and using this version I&#039;m able to establish connection, so ill stick with this for now. Have you guys tried building and test the latest mainline openwrt with 4.4 kernel and the latest Bluetooth_6lowpan kernel module?</p></blockquote></div><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Regarding image not being built: Most times the reason for this is that you selected too many packages / the image would get too big.</p><p>Have you tried to start with a pristine configuration, and only after successfully compiling with this config, add more packages?</p></blockquote></div><p>I have compiled the chaos_calmer branch and it only outputs v1,v2,v3, but not v4.
