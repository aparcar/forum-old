					<p>Setting up wireless in a mesh network is something i&#039;ve done many times. Set wireless to AP mode / make sure channels are not overlapping / disable DHCP and done.</p><p>This time i need a guest wireless running as well. So i have 2 questions. Will my mesh network flow smoothly, using the WAN port, instead of the lan port (In AP mode)</p><p>Or do i need to bridge the lan to / wan to give the guest network internet access, while keeping my main WiFi in ap mode?</p><p>I feel like i&#039;ve just over complicated my problem but there it is.<br />Primary Wireless users need to be on the mesh network, walking from any location not loosing connectivity.<br />WiFi Guest users don&#039;t matter as they will not be moving physical locations while using the connection.</p>									</div>
