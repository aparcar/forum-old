					<p>Hi guys <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>First of all i&#039;d like to tell you what and how i did so far:</p><p>First i flashed the trunked image for v11: downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr841-v11-squashfs-factory.bin<br />This went absolutely fine but launching GUI failed.</p><p>According to wiki no problem ...<br />So i set up static ip by ssh, connected to my main router and tried to install LUCI manually.<br />This failed because of insufficient free space</p><p>So i researched a little and found this Thread: forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=66719<br />Right away i had the plan to try to upgrade to the image, which &quot;sinneo&quot; posted there.<br />So i downloaded the image and wanted to use winscp for upload --&gt; no access</p><p>Probably because i didn&#039;t set a pw for root? So i set password for root, rebooted and tried to connect again.<br />At this point WinSCP couldn&#039;t findy any running FTP Server on the device.</p><p>So i tried to install an FTP Server using:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>opkg update
opkg install openssh-sftp-server</code></pre></div><p>Also failed, no free space </p><p>After a little more research i think i finally managed to get at least a little free space using command:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>firstboot</code></pre></div><p>But meanwhile i think i&#039;m at the right point to ask you for help.<br />I&#039;d &quot;just&quot; like to upload the luci-included upgrade Image which &quot;sinneo&quot; posted here:<br />forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=66719</p><p>... and then hopefully finally upgrade to this build including Luci.</p><p>I hope you can help me realizing this. Any other alternative or even better way to realizing OPENWRT including LUCI on my router whould be very appreaciated too ... for sure <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>Thank you very much in advance and keep up the great work</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>iptvuser</strong> on 5 May 2017, 18:26)</p>

					<p>SCP not FTP.&nbsp; SCP server is built in to dropbear SSH server running on the router, you don&#039;t need to install anything.&nbsp; You do need a password set so the router will accept SSH logins.&nbsp; In other words if you can SSH you can also initiate a SCP from your PC and &quot;push&quot; the firmware file to the /tmp directory on the router.&nbsp; It is important to specify /tmp, which is in RAM, because if you try to put it in a flash portion of the filesystem obviously there is not 4 MB of space.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 5 May 2017, 17:35)</p>
