					<p>I just upgraded to RC5, and so far it exceeded my expectations. I used to have X-WRT build with a nice web-based UI. I looked at standard build, and LuCI was just too skimpy for me (I am OK with command-line, I just don&#039;t know which options go to which file in which format).</p><p>Anyway, as I said, RC5 looks awesome. I have a few problems so far - and I am stuck with just one.</p><p>I have a USB drive in the router. It mounts fine, but it doesn&#039;t mount automatically. Also, in System - Startup tab umount is reporting as &quot;disabled&quot; even if I try to enable it from web or command line.</p><p>I don&#039;t see anything in the log that mounting failed; so I assume it was never attempted</p>									</div>

					<p>didn&#039;t work out... I see mountd running - but usb drive doesn&#039;t get mounted until I mount it manually. It&#039;s not a huge deal... my router runs for months at a time, and I can put it in startup file as well... but still - weird!</p>									</div>
