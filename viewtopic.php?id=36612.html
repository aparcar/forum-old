					<p>Hi everybody,</p><p>I&#039;ve bought a Siemens Gigaset SX762, because it should be compatible with OpenWRT as long as the serial looks like S30852-S70x-xxxx, according to the wiki page for the device:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/gigaset/sx76x">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/gigaset/sx76x</a></p><p>Mine has serial S30852-S707-M121-2.. However, when I check the status -&gt; device page, I see the following:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Firmware version:            2.3.52.12.00
Bootcode version:            Primary: 2.1.0.0.12     Secondary: 2.1.0.20.0
Configuration file version:  286055-01-NDL-Retail_28_S1
ADSL driver version:         1.4.1.13.0.1
Wireless driver version:     5.3.1.6
User interface version:      16.01.2009
Hardware version:            Q709-R221
Serial number:               0001E38F1E28</code></pre></div><p>It is running the 2.x firmware, that corresponds to some amazon SoC, instead of the 4.x firmware it should be running according to the wiki. Also, when checking some debug logs, I found the following: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Jan  1 01:10:38 War &lt;EVENT&gt; kernel: drv_amazon:FIO_AMAZON_INIT
Jan  1 01:10:38 War &lt;EVENT&gt; kernel: Board_InitPlatform!
Jan  1 01:10:38 War &lt;EVENT&gt; kernel: SPI_Init!
Jan  1 01:10:38 War &lt;EVENT&gt; kernel: Board_InitIrq!
Jan  1 01:10:38 War &lt;EVENT&gt; kernel: init finished!
Jan  1 01:10:38 War &lt;EVENT&gt; kernel: drv_amazon:reset deactivated!</code></pre></div><p>Is this true? Did I buy a device with the wrong SoC or is there something I miss? And more importantly, is there any way for me to run OpenWRT or another custom firmware? I really hope to find some solution, for I was really looking forward to modding this thing :&#039;(</p><p>Thanks a million,</p><p>Mono</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah, you got the wrong device. In principle there&#039;s no reason why OpenWrt wouldn&#039;t run on Amazon as well. After all, there is code in OpenWrt source related to EASY50601 evaluation kit, based on Amazon. However, few people are interested in it, so you would be on your own.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok snk, thanks for your reply. The code you referred to, is about the PSB50601 chip. In my device I find a 50505. On the internet i don&#039;t seem to find any more information about this chip, do&nbsp; you think code for the 50601 will be compatible with the 50505? I&#039;d like to give it a try and get it running anyway <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve got 2 sx762&#039;s here, an AnnexB, S30852-S709-M121-11, running an Amazon, and an AnnexA, S30852-S705-M321-6, running a Danube. At the outside I can see one striking difference, the Danube has a button between the USB port and the LAN ports, marked with a &#039;wireless&#039; symbol and the text &#039;scan&#039;, while the Amazon hasn&#039;t.<br />On one of the photographs in the wiki <span class="postimg"><img src="http://wiki.openwrt.org/_media/media/sx763_usb5v_pin.jpg?w=300" alt="http://wiki.openwrt.org/_media/media/sx763_usb5v_pin.jpg?w=300" /></span> you can see this button as well, so I wondered if this could be a way to distinguish&nbsp; the boxes.</p>									</div>
