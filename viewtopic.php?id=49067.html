					<p>Hi Guys ,</p><p>I have 2 Routers &quot;VTECH IAD303+&quot; , on of them is unlocked so I can change the username and the password for the PPPOE account , and the other one is locked . I cannot change the username of the PPPOE</p><p>there is a UART port on the router board , I wonder if its possible to clone the &quot;opened flash image router&quot; and copy it on the locked router . so I will have 2 unlocked routers</p><p>note: the router is running Jungo openRG customized firmware</p><p>router informations :<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/vtech/iad303n">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/vtech/iad303n</a></p><p>Thanks Alot<br />Regards</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>y.balawi</strong> on 18 Feb 2014, 23:14)</p>

					<p>According to the wiki the bootloader is u-boot. Depending on how crippled it is, you could use &#039;md&#039; to hex-dump the contents of the flash, and then convert that to a binary dump.

I managed to use UART Cable and log into the router using HyperTerminal , but the boot loader was locked with a password , my friend have a non-working router from the same company , when we tried to use UART cable on it , there was no password on it , and the telnet port is wide open . I logged into the router using telnet , but evey time I try to change the PPPOE password from the command line , the router reboots automatically without committing any changes. I tried to download files from the router using TFTP software , and it worked , but I don&#039;t really know what to do with these files , and there is something else </p><p>is it possible to get the bootloader password from the files ???</p><p>also at some point the bootloader says : Press ESC to enter BOOT MENU mode. .. I try to press ESCAPE button many times , but it didn&#039;t work , <br />even CTRL+C and CTRL+Break</p>									</div>

					<p>So you have telnet access to your &#039;locked&#039; modem, and telnet+bootloader access to the other one? </p><p>Have a look at the mtd configuration, are they the same? </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cat /proc/mtd</code></pre></div><p>And is the bootloader in one of the Linux-accessible partitions? If yes, you can at least dump it, and have a look with &#039;strings&#039; or an hexeditor to see if the password is embedded. (It should, but not necessarily in plain text).<br />If the partitions on the two boxes have the same sizes, I guess it should be possible to clone the &#039;open&#039; box.</p>									</div>
