					<p>Hi folks,<br />I bought the SeagateDockStar earlier this year and played around with it since April. I started with Gentoo on USB Stick (<a href="http://ahsoftware.de/dockstar">http://ahsoftware.de/dockstar</a>) and gave other distributions a shot (FreeBSD,Debian,pogoplug). None of them fit into the onboard flash memory - or did not behave like I expected from a small embedded distribution. So I started using the original buildroot. I have a pretty good running rootfs which I test over NFS mount (I will put my patches online via gitorious or something else). Unfortunatly I get stuck at the point where I have to configure every package on my own (samba,cups,bittorrent,automount and much more). Since I have not that much time, I looked for alternatives and figured out, that Eric did similar work for OpenWRT&#039;s buildroot. I checked it out and felt very comfortable with the environment because I know the general principles from the original buildroot. All the &quot;distributional&quot; work was already done and in most cases well tested by a lot of OpenWRT users.... great!</p><p>During my tests, I discovered the following issues which should be solved in trunk:<br />- jffs2-image does not pad to 128k, but the name implies that (change L30 in image/Makefile: bs=128k)<br />- padding squashfs to 128k and separate it from the uImage (currently a combined u-boot-uImage-block is generated)<br />- if someone likes to have uImage combined with u-boot, the image name should reflect this<br />- u-boot:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- I strongly prefere the 2nd stage bootloader, so one is always able to fall back to factory default<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- the generated u-boot image has a different ethaddr set - I didn&#039;t find an option in image-menu to set my own ethaddr<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- the rootfs type points to jffs2 only - I like the overlay solution and gave squashfs a try - I was forced to change the parameter from jffs2 to squashfs manually (not a problem for me, but could be changed...)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- this leds to next manual configuration issue - the 5th mtdpart with no 4 was not configured to the name rootfs_data - so the overlay was not automagically created by the initskript - I changed the name from data to rootfs_data in 2nd stage bootloader and it did work :-)<br />- <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/7293">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/7293</a> -&gt; hotplug2 seems to be a valid replacement</p><p>suggestions:<br />- clean squashfs image (default)<br />- try jffs2 and squashfs as rootfstype (default)<br />- provide an option for setting ethaddr ( menuconfig ? )<br />- provide an overlay option (menuconfig?) or the profile default should be overlay if squashfs is generated (-&gt; rename mtdpart name)</p><p>I&#039;m willing to test and implement that, but since I have not much time, I need help from other experienced OpenWRT developers/users.<br />Gerrit, Eric, Lars, AllDockstarTrainees? Are you still working on this?</p><p>Please let me know, if my help/offer is appreciated or not (and if ther eis any chance to continue work on the Dockstar).</p><p>Regards,<br />Ossy</p>									</div>

Just to clarify things. I prefere to leave the original u-boot in mtd0 and use a 2nd u-boot in mtd1 (current behaviour of svn-trunk). I won&#039;t have a problem with upgrading u-boot in mtd0 (e.g. the one of&nbsp; <a href="http://jeff.doozan.com/debian/uboot/">Jeff</a> ), BUT OpenWrt should be usable by a wide range of users and one should be able to remove OpenWrt from it&#039;s device and try other software with minimal effort. OpenWrt project would have full control about a 2nd u-boot in designated mtd1 and can do everything. So ideally, the user has less configuration work and the device can be recovered easily. An additional mtdpart is a low price for easier configuration and less administrative work.</p><p>I hope, I explained my point of view intelligible to all.</p><p>Regards,<br />Ossy</p>									</div>

I was wondering why ifconfig shows my original hwaddr, even if openwrt-u-boot has a different one. This point should be mentioned somewhere. So it is in fact important to leave the original u-boot in place.

The compilation on my debian squeeze works out of the box after an &quot;svn co&quot; (if you use the defaults).</p>									</div>
