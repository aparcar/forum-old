However, after that, I did a &quot;make package&quot; which also build the iptables packages and after that, I begin to see this error if I want to make the rootfs binary again.</p><p>I need to go into build_mipsel/iptables* and do a &#039;make clean&#039; then I can make the rootfs binary again.</p><p>I have redo it a number of times and can confirm that the &quot;make package&quot; way of making iptables does something bad.</p><p>EDIT2:</p><p>Found the problem but don&#039;t know how to fix it. The whole sequence is like this :</p><p>1. &quot;make&quot; would copy only iptables(not v6) files to root and run strip, this is fine<br />2. make package would additionally copy&nbsp; v6 related files(but not the v4 files) to there and run strip again. The problem starts from here as strip seems to have problem striping already stripped files(the v4 files already there). This gives me 92 byte files, without any warning or error message even though this is already wrong.<br />3. &quot;make&quot; again would once again run strip which now barks because it sees the 92 byte files.</p><p>Seems like a bug in strip.</p>									</div>

					<p>Find a temp fix. I change the iptables.mk and add the following two &quot;touch&quot; </p><p>$(TARGET_DIR)/sbin/iptables: $(IPTABLES_BUILD_DIR)/iptables<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; touch $(IPTABLES_BUILD_DIR)/iptables<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; touch $(IPTABLES_BUILD_DIR)/extensions/*so</p><p>this would force the &quot;install&quot; to recopy the non-stripped files to root again which strip would feel happy.</p><p>Please consider adding this. Otherwise, even the following would fail :</p><p>1. make <br />this would make the firmware correctly.</p><p>2. make<br />making it again would already results in error without any warning.</p>									</div>
