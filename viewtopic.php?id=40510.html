					<p>hi</p><p>im trying to update TinyProxy from version 1.8.2 to 1.8.3</p><p>everytime i run <em>make</em> it ends up with <em>Error 1</em><br />..so im probably missing something very basic..</p><br /><p>in make file i change just the version and md5sum then i run <em>./scripts/feeds update -i</em> and then i can see changes what i made in <em>./feeds/package.index</em> (i also tried <em>make package/index</em>) so after that i believed that it will work but it doesnt..</p><p>if i understand it right..<br />- feeds repository holds only paths and &quot;configuration&quot; files for <em>make</em><br />- when i run <em>make</em> it.. reads the make file<br />- download the source code of the package from the path provided in make file<br />- check the md5sum if the file is OK<br />- then it compile the package</p><p>so if i change the path and md5sum it should work .. ? what im missing ?</p><p>btw.. there re only slight changes between versions 1.8.2 and 1.8.3</p><br /><p>..im sure that problem is between monitor and chair......</p><br /><p>EDIT: just for sure.. i tried to run <em>make</em> in verbose mode but it doesnt show me anythig useful..</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>user71x</strong> on 13 Nov 2012, 20:12)</p>
