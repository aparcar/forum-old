					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have small problem with ulogd-mod-mysql package on Backfire 10.03.1 on ar71xx architecture (router: TL-WR1043ND)<br />I have got installed ulogd and ulogd-mod-mysql and libmysqlclient packages and when I turn on mysql module in ulogd.conf I get error message with information that ulogd_MYSQL.so file could not be found.<br />I tried even to recompile all ulogd modules from source and I tried even to link ulogd_MYSQL.so with libmysqlclient_r but I always get the same error message:<br />file not found but when I execute ls on the mysql file from ulogd.config file I get full information about file.<br />I checked in the ulogd.c source file where is the problem and it appears that &quot;dlopen()&quot; function on ulogd_MYSQL.so returns NULL.</p><p>I tried to use ulogd with PostgreSQL and I was successfull, there was no error reported.<br />I also compared source code of ulogd_PGSQL.c and ulogd_MYSQL.c but they look very similar.</p><p>Only one thing worries me: the size of ulogd_MYSQL.so plugin which is almost 200K but ulogd_PGSQL.so takes only 12K on disk.</p><p>Could anybody of you, the forum users, confirm that this problem exist not only on my equipment but also on other devices and architectures?</p><p>I have alredy created a bug issue on openwrt.org portal but so far there is not any feedback from anyone.</p><p>Best regards,<br />Lukasz</p>									</div>
