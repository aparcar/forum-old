					<p>Hi.&nbsp; I encountering some problem with a very elusive cause, which may be something to do with the WET mode.<br />I&#039;d like to solicite other testers to see if they can reproduce this. </p><p>I&#039;m using experimental CVS. Here is my configuration:</p><p>&quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are WRT54G&#039;s.<br />&quot;C&quot; is a Linux PC (Ubuntu, for all that matters)<br />&quot;D&quot; is a FreeBSD 5.3-release PC.</p><p>C and D are connected to B.<br />B has a WET bridge to A which is my NAT router to the Internet.<br />So (you may need monospace fonts to see this diagram)</p><p>internet (pppoe) === A ----wireless------&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; B === ethernet ===&nbsp; C<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;=== ethernet ===&nbsp; D</p><br /><p>Consider the following scenarios</p><p>(1) Suppose, from C, I ssh into A. In that ssh session on A, I execute ping D. It fails.<br />(100% packet loss, details later [*])</p><p>(2) Suppose, from D, I ssh into A. In that ssh session on A, I execute ping C. It fails.</p><p>(3) Same as (1), but I ping C instead. It works --- I get all the ping replies.<br />(4) Same as (2), but I ping D instead. It works.</p><p>(5) Pinging C directly from D and vice versa of course works.</p><p>(6) Most other operations (e.g. Web browsing) from C (or D) to A seem to work fine.<br />(A is my NAT router to my ISP.)</p><p>[*] The ping fails even with all firewalls turned off on all sides, <br />so it does not seem to be a firewall problem. Also, _sometimes_, when I invoke ping,<br />I get the ping replies correctly for the first 10 to 20 packets or so, and then the<br />ping replies start coming in for no reason (without me exiting the ping program).<br />During all this time, if I ping A from C (or D) that works,<br />but (1) (or (2)) simultaneously fails.</p><p>After some sleuthing, I found out that the problem seems to disappear<br />if I *do not* use the WET mode, but use WDS instead to connect between A and B.</p><p>Finally if I connect C and D directly to A, there is no problem at all.</p><p>Would someone kindly try to reproduce this ?</p><p>Thanks very much in advance!</p><p>// Steve</p>									</div>

					<p>It doesn&#039;t surprise me if you didn&#039;t break the bridge.</p><p>If you don&#039;t break the bridge by assigning different subnets to the client mode router and the AP, you can&#039;t expect multiple machines behind the client mode router to work reliablly.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ah that explains it<br />(all along I assumed it was just magic that WET even worked <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />,<br />and it half-works with even APs that don&#039;t say they explicitly support bridging of any kind).</p><p>But since WET is default on OpenWRT (when not running as client)<br />I think there should be huge warning signs about it not being reliable</p><p>Thanks very much for everyone&#039;s help,</p><p>// Steve</p><p>(I&#039;m happily using WDS now, although I&#039;m comtemplating just using layer-3 routing<br />to get around these problems when I have to connect to an AP that does not support WDS.<br />Any one have a rough idea how fast a WRT can do layer-3 forwarding?)</p>									</div>
