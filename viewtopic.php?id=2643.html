					<p>Hello all ,<br />I am Hamradio operator too and have crosscompiled the ax25 libs , ax25 tools , ax25 apps for the use of the so called <br />&quot; kernel-AX25 &quot; in linux ( openwrt ) . <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /><br />well , i know ik6ihg you have contact to Jann , dg8ngn , ok , Jann have a few packages for ax25 on his server somewhere at db0fhn , i have now tested this packages and they are not full working , parts of these packages are linked at compile time&nbsp; to the wrong libraries . <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />If you want a full working kernel-ax25 in openwrt please look at <a href="http://db0noe.dyndns.org/openwrt">http://db0noe.dyndns.org/openwrt</a> <br />there are my files for a working kernel-ax25 in openwrt , you need the libax25 , ax25 tools , ax25 apps and a firmware-image of openwrt with compiled in ax25 support , all this are at the url above . <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />Ok my files at db0noe are not based on the actually version of openwrt ( whiterussian) i have used the last experimental <br />version of openwrt , and it is working stable .<br />i don&#039;t have the time at the moment to check if i can the kernel-ax25 activate in whiterussian RC3 version , but i see <br />no problem .<br />the only thing you must do is&nbsp; before you can activate ax25 in openwrt - source you must have compiled it first , it downloads a lot of sourcecode from the internet at compile -time ( of course , the linux -kernel -sources too ) <br />if you have sucessfully compiled it , you have somewhere the kernel source locally and you can go to the directory <br />with the kernel sources , all you have to do there is to make a&nbsp; <br />make menuconfig<br />command and you should have the menu for the kernel-config on the screen , go to the menu , find the entries for ax25 <br />and simply activate what you want .<br />then you have to save the config and build a new kernel for the firmware&nbsp; - image of openwrt <br />i have put a sample&nbsp; .config file&nbsp; for a linux -kernel with ax25 at db0noe .<br />If i will find a little bit time i think i will put a description at the site at db0noe&nbsp; , how to compile it in and how to use it and so on . We have here 2 wrt54gs with this modified , ax25 ready openwrt firmware and the tools and so on running <br />one in AP and the other wrt54gs in STA mode , both with the serial -console mod , and its funny you can setup 2 wrt routers , use ax25ipd and you can use the serial ports for kiss input from a&nbsp; rmnc -node or so , and at the second wrt too <br />and can do ax25 over wifi , its pretty cool , with the right setup this works like a long cable&nbsp; but it looks like this :<br />computer rs232 &gt; rs232 at wrt -router &gt; wifi&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; wrt-router &gt;rs232 at wrt-router &gt; ....whatever you want ..... with rs232 and kiss ... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/cool.png" width="15" height="15" alt="cool" /><br />i have put the sources for the ax25 libs , ax25 apps , and tools at db0noe too , im not sure if you can use the source , <br />it may be that the source is not working at other systems like mine , all files are edited for crosscompiling , it looks <br />terrible ...<br />one thing is important : if you want to use the listen -program , you have to install the ncurses ipk package too <br />without installed ncurses you get only an error from the listen -program .<br />at the moment i will see if i can compile all the kernel -related ax25 stuff as modules , i think it makes sense , if this will<br />work , you can load the modules to a router with the &quot;normal&quot; openwrt -firmware on it&nbsp; , say insmod xyz or something else and it may work , the only thing is , if i compile modules , it always depends at the kernel -version but then you <br />don&#039;t have to flash the router if you will enable ax25 <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> </p><p>i hope there are some hams out there at the openwrt-forum , test it ....<br />thank you for reading this and .. please excuse my bad english ... itÂ¶ really not my language ....<br />and of course i must say thank you to all the guys here at openwrt and all who worked and programmed the source -code of openwrt ,&nbsp; really GREAT ! <br />I have read a lot of posts here at the forum to understand whats going on in this firmware , and how things work , and must say thats the best documentation i have ever seen&nbsp; .<br />And a big thank you to the following HAM -RADIO OPERATORS :<br />DG8NGN&nbsp; , Jann <br />DG5MPQ , Thomas <br />DL9SAU<br />DL3SJB , the one who worked at the crosscompiling of aprsd ....<br />..and many others , too much to write here ......<br />ok , thats it , <br />have a nice day !</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve been trying to use this, and a bunch of things work, but net2kiss doesn&#039;t.
