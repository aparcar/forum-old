					<p>Hi Folks,</p><p>For the past hour or so I&#039;ve been trying to figure out if I can run OpenWRT on my DIR-855 but I&#039;m unable to find any info about it.</p><p>Can you please tell me if its supported and if so, which package I would need? I&#039;ve been browsing the downloads and supported hardware, is the 855 the same ar71xx as the 825?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
