					<p>What is preferred method for keeping up with the nightly builds?</p><p>If every few days I want to install the latest nightly build, should I clear NVRAM after installation? After new installation do I have to reinstall Luci? If I don&#039;t clear NVRAM, do I still have to install luci?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>meazz1</strong> on 1 Apr 2016, 22:47)</p>

					<p>are you on a prebuilt trunk or a custom build?&nbsp; is it necessary to flash if the change doesn&#039;t apply to your router? prebuilt trunk doesn&#039;t come with luci hence need to reinstall luci.&nbsp; some routers need clearing nvram but unless your router needs it it&#039;s not really necessary. save configuration with flash works fine within same builds however there is no harm in starting fresh every few months.</p>									</div>
