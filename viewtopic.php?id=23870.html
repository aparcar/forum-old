					<p>there are often problems with openwrt running as wifi-repeater in bridged mode.<br />I guess, it would be a good idea to try first if a routing /nating setup is working:<br />STA-interface as WAN-Interface and the AP-interface bridged to the LAN.&nbsp; </p><p>If this is working, you can look for a solution in bridged mode, but as far as I know, bridged repeater were (and maybe are) only working between two atheros-wifis, or two broadcom-wifis, but not in mixed environments. because the atheros implementation is not really wds, it is ap- or stationmode with an extended packageheader (with 4 hardwareaddressfields)</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks. But if I understand correctly, putting STA on WAN then AP on LAN will create another NAT LAN behind main NAT router. That might be the last thing I&#039;ll do.</p><p>To compare, I tried dd-wrt which does the job correctly and surprisingly easy -- I get bridge mode to work in like 10 minutes -- main AP in WDS-STA mode w/ WEP encryption then a VAP in WPA2+AES, and all devices behind dd-wrt get a 192.168.1.0/24 IP address. I noticed that DD-WRT used madwifi as wifi driver so I then flashed back to OpenWrt to try madwifi -- no luck, seems that openwrt madwifi doesn&#039;t support this wireless radio at all..</p><p>So I currently put dd-wrt on this router, with lots of OpenWrt ipkgs -- from busybox, coreutils to Asterisk -- still would like to get OpenWrt to work but I might just settle with dd-wrt now..</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>uia</strong> on 12 Mar 2010, 23:49)</p>
