					<p>So, I recently moved and decided top set up my old router as a dumb wireless access point and LAN switch in my living room.My ISP supplies me with a router, and since they dont allow bridge mode, i have the old router as an AP. I used a 1 year old Open-WRT firmware that i had on the router since i last used it.</p><p>But my problem is that the wireless conenction speed is absolutley horrible. My desktop is on 24/7, and i share some multimedia from it like series and movies. When i try to stream from this computer, performance is horrible to the point that its useless. I got a 80/20 fiber line so the internet should be blazing fast. But its not. Its laggy and slow from my wireless devices.</p><p>Also, today i decided to dig a bit deeper, and flashed the router to the latest version i found (CC 15.05), but it did not help. I also tried playing around with the WiFi setting wihtout improvements. Also, according to the scan i did, there are not many wireless devices in the area, I got maybe 10 on each network (2.4 and 5) I moved the channel to a free area, and also increased the width. </p><p>But now im running out of ideas. </p><p><strong>Setup:</strong><br />Router: TP-Link Archer C7 v2.0. Flashed with CC 15.05<br />Desktop: Regular Windows PC with an Intel network chip<br />Wireless Device: iPhone SE (tested on both 2.4 and 5.0 networks)</p><p><strong>Results using Ookla Speedtest</strong><br />Desktop<br />1ms - 80.27Mbps (Down) - 23.98Mbps (Up)</p><p>Wireless 2.4<br />7ms - 9.11Mbps (Down) - 9.01Mbps (Up)</p><p>Wireless 5.0<br />2ms - 22.09Mbps (Down) - 20.35Mbps (Up)</p><p>Wireless 2.4 from my ISP supplied router (802.11b/g/n) (enabled only for this test)<br />2ms - 28.35Mbps (Down) - 30.52Mbps (Up)</p><br /><p>Does anyone have som ideas on how i can fix this?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Zepticon</strong> on 19 Mar 2017, 19:32)</p>

					<p>There has been a lot of work on both ath9k and ath10k since Chaos Calmer was released.&nbsp; Ath9k is the driver for the 2.4 radio and ath10k the 5 GHz.&nbsp; These newer drivers require a newer kernel version, so they can&#039;t be back-ported to CC.</p><p>You could also try stock firmware.&nbsp; Stock firmware is fine for running a dumb AP.&nbsp; Just go in and turn the DHCP server off.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 19 Mar 2017, 23:03)</p>

					<p>Okay, there was a clear improvement with 60/29 and 36/30 on the 5.0 and 2.4 networks using LEDE. But still, should it not be able to fully match my bandwidth?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Zepticon</strong> on 20 Mar 2017, 13:55)</p>
