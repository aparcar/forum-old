					<p>Hi...<br />I did reflash a lot of them. I resolded vertical antenna to external antenna and a lot of them worked fine. The is an aditional small script to make everithing work fine.</p><p>So i bought 5 of theese APs last week and flahed them as usually, after resolding. Something strange happened... <br />They got bricked! </p><p>I was having an old one at home and opened the case and inside it says v2.0 but on the outside of the case it stated to be an v2.1. I looked at the new ones inside and they say v2.1.</p><p>What&#039;s the catch? Is there a new v2.1?</p><p>The strangest thing is that i made it to unbrick them downloading from TP-L... support page the stock firmware wich is the same as for the old ones... </p><p>Has anyone had theese troubles? How can i flash OpenWrt on theese APs?</p><p>Thanks for your answers.</p>									</div>
