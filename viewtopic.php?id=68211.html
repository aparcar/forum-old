					<p>So ..</p><p>My router has a strange issues:</p><p>- no power led on boot , actually no leds at all, only the two wifi leds are flashing one time if i turn it off</p><p>i loaded the 15.05.1 firmware into it, and it was working great until the router hanged so i had to reset it off/on</p><p>After this it is bricked.</p><p>I had this before i thought the power supply was dead but not. The first time i had this no response situation i let the router <br />for few weeks offline , coz i thought its fully dead, but somehow after this time i plugged the power and it was booting normal, but its again bricked cos of the on/off reboot.</p><p>I have a PL2303 HX usb-ttl serial cable , has followed the instructions but no luck mostly.</p><p>I get not further than &quot;sending boot message. reboot the target \&quot; </p><p>Mostly 99% it stops there. I had one time the image was not uploaded error message and the router seemed to work for few minutes, i got wifi, then it was dead again.</p><p>I followed the wiki page info to uart boot - no luck , the putty from windows - no luck </p><p>Maybe you have some new ideas.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>microsoundfield</strong> on 23 Oct 2016, 11:48)</p>
