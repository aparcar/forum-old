					<p>Hi, I&#039;m new here. How&#039;s everybody doing?</p><p>I have a strange case of my WR841N v8.4 not talking properly via Putty with my PC. I&#039;m using USB-TTL serial interface on CH340G and only listening seems to be working fine. I checked all cables, plugs, connections under magnifying glass and traced them to SoC and verified there is a signal (with a beep on multimeter). I checked CH340g as well - all OK.</p><p>Baud I&#039;m using is 117000, 7N1 - yes, that&#039;s 7bits-often case with ch340.<br />When I disconnect Rx router side, I can read console on 115200 without artifacts.<br />With both lines connected I get:<br />[Links here - can&#039;t post yet]<br />115200: imgur_com/a/2L6AM<br />128000: imgur_com/a/lDTWS</p><p>I read somewhere about pluging in multimeter between Rx and Gnd and it seems to have helped a bit as I&#039;m able to interact with router but still cannot enter &#039;tpl&#039;. Interaction is allowed after booting process, when whatever I type in I get asked to authenticate with a login and pswd-tried admin/admin and root/5up-nothing works but at least I get information back that credentials were invalid - Tx(PC)-&gt;Rx works</p><p>Vcc not connected ofc.</p><p>I figured I make some more measurements, just in case. Maybe someone will have any idea what to do.<br />Pins on router have: Vcc-3.3v; Tx-2.52v; Rx-3.03v with USB-TTL connected and ACadapter ON.<br />Impendence between pins: Rx-Gnd - 725 Ohm; Rx-Vcc - indefinite; Tx-Gnd - 722Ohm; Tx-Vcc - 82,5kOhm</p><p>Do I need to use a pull-up/pull-down resistor? I know it has not been the case on my build but who knows? What are your voltages on the pins?<br />Maybe Rx is not Rx?</p><p>Can anyone help? Thanks a bunch <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>meekowai</strong> on 21 Nov 2017, 18:06)</p>

					<p>Your connection setting is pretty weird, better use the standard 115200 8N1.<br />If you get some proper feedback of your input when the system is fully booted, then you probably have a usable connection over all and it is just a matter of bad timing to enter uboot. It took many of us a couple of tries to succeed on that, and one good solution is copying tpl to the clipboard and then just rapidly hit the shortcut keys for pasting its content.</p>									</div>

					<p>Finally I was able to connect.</p><p>!! I shortened my cable from 30 to 15 centimeters !!<br />Nowhere have I found information about the cable length and to keep it to minimum. Thought 30cm shouldn&#039;t be an issue.</p><p>Baud still needs to be 118000 - otherwise it&#039;s unreadable. I guess it has something to do with CH340G baud accuracy +/-5% according to datasheet. Rest is 8N1.</p><p>Now the &#039;tpl&#039; is catching correctly.</p><p>Issue solved...for now</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>meekowai</strong> on 22 Nov 2017, 10:01)</p>

In layman&#039;s terms: The difference in voltage between what your router already carries on VCC and what your adapter supplies on VCC can cause all kinds of havoc, from an unstable connection to a dead device.</p><p>If that&#039;s not the problem, one of the parts in your setup is not working in an ideal way, either your router, the adapter, or the port that&#039;s working your adapter.</p>									</div>
