					<p>I am a new OpenWrt user having used Tomato for a LONG time.</p><p>I&#039;ve recently aquired a TP-LINK WDR3600V1 and straight out of the box, I loaded OpenWRT, and setup a USB WAN connection via usb_ether tethering to my wifi hotspot. It worked well. I was using bleeding edge Chaos Calmer.</p><p>In an effort to move back to the stable release, I reverted the unit back to stock TP-Link OEM firmware successfully.<br />I then upgraded (i think this was my mistake) to TP-Link wdr3600v1_en_us_3_14_3_up_boot(151104).bin.<br />This was also successful and I have a functioning TP-Link WDR3600 running TP-Link firmware without USB Ether tether. </p><p>My attempts to load the stable OpenWRT Chaos Calmer have been unsuccessful due to the following errors:</p><p>Error code: 18005<br />Upgrade unsuccessfully because the version of the upgraded file was incorrect. Please check the file name.</p><p>There appears to be a check in the TP-link firmware for the filesize and/or other criteria.</p><p>Has anyone experienced this?</p><p>Is there a workaround so I can put OpenWRT back?<br />All of TP-Link&#039;s images read a size of 8,001KB in windows, but not in OpenWRT...it&#039;s the only thing I&#039;ve noticed.</p><p>If anyone can help, it would be much appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t have a WDR3600, so it&#039;s just a guess, but with the Archer C7 there was an issue that the filename of the OpenWrt image file was simply too long. You could try to rename it to firmware.bin and see if that helps.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, Silent Creek, I&#039;ve tried using the same filename that TP-Link uses on their firmware, factory.bin, wdr3600v1_tp_recovery.bin all with the same unsuccessful results.</p><p>The system initially appears to accept the firmware upgrade, and then immediately rejects it with the error from above, exactly as if a check is being done in the current firmware.</p><p>I agree with you vrdvaibhav, and am hoping we&#039;ll have a workaround soon.</p><p>I&#039;ll check out the link...</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve seen the same issue, but when trying to perform a TFTP load process. Using the serial interface, I see the TFTP process loads the OpenWRT firmware, but then silently rejects it and boots the factory firmware.</p><p>However, booting the router with the original factory firmware, I&#039;m able to load via the TP-Link GUI and wind up with a working OpenWRT.</p><p>I&#039;ve read that they are looking for some kind of signature on the firmware before allowing it to load.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve attempted upgrades via the factory web-gui as well as via the tftp recovery process.<br />The tftprecovery process downloads the image, but rejects the new image.</p><p>After a call to TP-Link support, they informed me that they have in fact implemented a firmware validation check that will not allow the installation of 3rd party firmware on their devices, at least using conventional methods. <br />This is to comply with new FCC regulations. <br />IMO, it was the easy way out for them to prevent 3rd party radio modifications.</p><p>I would recommend that users with older firmware on their TP-Link routers that wish to run 3rd party firmware like OpenWRT, DD-WRT or Tomato to not upgrade to the latest releases.</p><p>I am hopeful for a workaround.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>richie275</strong> on 30 Dec 2015, 22:03)</p>

					<p>Very foolish of them as no doubt it applies worldwide as TP-Link do not seem to have region-specific firmware.</p><p>I have bought three TP-Link routers over the last couple of years, I won&#039;t be buying any more if I cannot put OpenWRT on them.</p>									</div>
