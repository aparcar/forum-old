					<p>Hello, guys.</p><p>I&#039;ve flashed the wr841nd firmware to my 941nd v5.1, and it was working fine. I was trying to configure the router to turn it into a &quot;dumb bridge&quot; router, but i accidentaly changed into dynamic IP.</p><p>Now, i can&#039;t telnet into it (192.168.1./0.1/1.2/whatever dont do the trick), and, as you well know, can&#039;t get into failsafe mode. The router itself is functioning, but i can&#039;t telnet and change whatever i need to. Any tips?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

Is there a way of finding the routers ip by &quot;scanning&quot; a range of ips?? Becuase then i could find it and telnet to it..</p>									</div>
