					<p>HI milankocvara,</p><p>Thanks for the answer!</p><p>Yes, indeed there were some other processes using the serial port. I terminated them using this: ht tps://wiki .openwrt. org/doc/ recipes/terminate.console.on.serial (had to split the url because I can&#039;t post urls yet on this forum)<br />This greatly improved the rate of dropped packages.</p><p>Now when I run lsof /dev/ttyAMA0, the only process that shows is minicom. However, I&#039;m still missing some bytes (but much less than before). Any other tips?</p><p>P.S: I forgot to mention that I&#039;m using an STM32 running Arduino.</p><p>This is how the output looks like now:</p><br /><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog<br />The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog<br />The quick brown g<br />The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog<br />The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy The quick brown fox jumpThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog<br />The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog<br />The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog<br />The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</p></blockquote></div>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lucascoelhof</strong> on 9 Jan 2017, 21:33)</p>

					<p>Hello all,</p><p>I found the problem.</p><p>Alongside with the description provided by milankocvara, I also had to change the default configurations of the serial port. </p><p>I took out all the references for ttyAMA0 on the file /boot/cmdline.txt.
