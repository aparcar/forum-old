					<p>Typically source ports are auto-negotiated and are random, so that field is &quot;usually&quot; left as any. </p><p>Essentially, the web server is &quot;listening&quot; on port 443 for new connections and does not send on that same port (only listens), so a source port has to be negotiated after the initial connection. The server will talk back to the client (browser) on that random source port they agreed to talk on.</p><p>If the source port is random then why have a setting for a specific source port? Well there are situations where you might set up communications on a specific source port, and if you know how to control it, and what it is, then it can be defined.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m a big fan of the 4.9er build!!! (Also all 4.4 and wifi works great)<br />With kernel 4.9 it should be possible to activate 802.1AE/macsec/layer2-encryption.
