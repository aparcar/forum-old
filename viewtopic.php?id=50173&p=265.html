If you are really tight on ram, but haven&#039;t yet completely run out, you can get into the situation where the system has to read from flash (and uncompress) every time you access something, or in extreme cases, every time you check a file timestamp.</p><p>Rather than watching the available ram, watch disk I/O instead.

The snmp agent (snmpd) needs to be polled for the information, and as the information piles up, disc space can become an issue. To be clear, the router will not send the performance data, it must be polled using a application like Nagios or MRTG (There&#039;s a lot of them out there). I use HP SiteScope Freemium, but they all work the same way when it comes to SNMP. </p><p>The issue is with the MIBS (OIDs), and knowing what OID&#039;s to poll. That is where I can help as I&#039;ve documented where all of the interesting OID are. I have them on a spread sheet, and would be willing to share with anyone.</p><p>Once you have your application set up and ready to poll, I can give you the OID&#039;s, and you&#039;re off and running.</p></blockquote></div><p>another good approach you can take is to configure the router to send it&#039;s logs to a remote server and then have scripts on the box gather the stats and write them to syslog. SNMP is inefficient in that for each value you want to gather, you have to query it independently. If you are doing this over a network that you are then trying to measure, you end up with a hiesenberg. Using logging, you can gather a bunch of data and send it as one log entry, which becomes just one packet sent out.</p>									</div>

No program runs 100% of the time (even openvpn under load), at some point every program needs to wait for something to happen (even if it&#039;s just getting the next chunk of network traffic from the OS). When this happens, something else can get a chance to run on the CPU that the app was running on. When the CPU hungry program is ready to run again, the OS has a choice between having it wait until the process running on the CPU it was on pauses, or running it on the other CPU. It almost always is going to end up running it on the other CPU because it doesn&#039;t know how long the process that&#039;s running is going to keep running.</p><p>If the CPU has a large cache (the way x86 systems do), this can hurt as reading from memory is slower than reading from cache. Back in the day when x86 systems were around 1GHz clock speeds, I was doing some testing on a dual-processor box and found that I was able to get ~10% faster performance of a number crunching process by running setiathome to keep the other CPU busy and prevent linux from bouncing the process from one processor to the other. Since then linux has gotten smarter about such things.</p><p>you can set cpu affinity/cpu limits for the openvpn process to limit it so that it can only run on one core and see if that makes a difference.</p><p>the Marvell Armada 38X cpu in these systems has a 1M cache, which isn&#039;t that large, and since both cores use the same cache, you shouldn&#039;t suffer much of a penalty for bouncing from one core to the other. So I would not expect any measurable difference in OpenVPN throughput if you limit it to running on one core as opposed to bouncing between cores.</p>									</div>

I signed up for a BBS. My favorite program was called Terminate. Jim Dunmyer did finally get a T1 to share amongst us and it was like lightning compared to the dial up speeds I still have my last modem a Courier v. everything and remember replacing the chip to gain new capabilities AKA speed. I Remember buying Multiple external modems from 1200 on up until I got smart. I built quite a few computers after that... Before it was cheaper to buy prebuilt. I like to learn and this is a fun way to learn at least a little about Nix. I messed around with Nix for a short time but I have run multiple boot for quite awhile and LILO was not so cooperative so I stayed with Microsoft.<br/>So please excuse me if I ask stupid questions <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile"/><br/>Thanks for your patience. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile"/></p>									</div>
