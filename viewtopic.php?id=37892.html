					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am new to OpenWRT and would like to play around a little bit with UCI and luci. What I would need at the moment would be a way to configure users for PPTPd.</p><p>My idea was to create a new UCI configuration &quot;users&quot; and generate a &quot;chat-secrets&quot; file from it.</p><p>The problem is that, although I found some information about UCI and LUCI in the wiki, I have no clue when to transform the configuration. It seems to me that at some point UCI &quot;commits&quot; the changes but then I would assume that some sort of &quot;configurator&quot; gets called which calls some scripts which allow one to act on the configuration changes.</p><p>I hope someone can give me an idea were to look or explain it in a few lines.</p><p>Thanks in advance</p><p>jens</p>									</div>

					<p>When you save a UCI config via LuCI, LuCI calls a reload of the corresponding init script. This script is usually where UCI configuration translations occur. Check out the dnsmasq init script (/etc/init.d/dnsmasq) for a a very verbose example.</p><p>Basically you just:<br />1) Read the UCI config<br />2) Dump a service-specific config<br />3) Start/restart the service</p><p>To tell LuCI which init script to restart when you apply your changes, check out /etc/config/ucitrack. I believe the definitions are still done in there.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>aport</strong> on 5 Jul 2012, 20:55)</p>
