					<p>It seems that the firmware is somehow broken (unsuccessfull flash). Try to flash firmware again (you have enabled boot_wait, didn&#039;t you?) using TFTP. If you haven&#039;t enabled boot_wait (big fault but you already know it) you have to open the device and try harder to find the desired pins (pins number 5 and 6 on the FLASH chip) and then upload firmware using TFTP client. It&#039;s not difficult, believe me. Just make sure that you use firmware smaller than 3MiB (3145728B). Original Linksys firmware is larger than that so you have to use pre-built openwrt firmware.</p>									</div>
