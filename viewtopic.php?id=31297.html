					<p>I just purchased a new WRT54GL and tried to install WhiteRussian on it. The firmware flashed successfully, but I have been completely unable to change the password. I have tried both on the web-based interface and via Putty and have tried multiple different passwords with varying levels of strength, but haven&#039;t gotten it to work. When I attempt to set the password, it prompts me to re-enter the new password, which I do, but then nothing happens.</p><p>What can I do to solve this very troublesome issue? I have been really excited to get into OpenWRT and I was told White Russian is arguably the best interface, but it looks now as though I will be unable to do anything for a while. Help would be very much appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>I looked through the wiki on firstlogin ( <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/firstlogin">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/firstlogin</a> ) and it has no help addressing why I can&#039;t seem to set a password. This is really frustrating. Someone please help.</p><p>When I telnet the router it&#039;ll ask to set the password, but then freezes up and ceases to work; same deal when in the web UI. wtf am I doing wrong here? Did I brick it?</p>									</div>
