					<p>If you are going to do WDS, you need to do it on both ends. I haven&#039;t had much success with WDS since the early days of the WRT54G, so it may not work.</p><p>If you are just looking to client the 2nd router off the first, then put the first router in AP mode. But be aware this will only work for IPv4. IPv6 doesn&#039;t work in &quot;client mode&quot; (hint: you have to setup routed WLANs like HomeNet to get IPv6 working across wireless)</p>									</div>

					<p>First find out why the first one has no Internet.&nbsp; Since the main router is <strong>not</strong> 192.168.1.x, simply using default settings where WAN pulls a DHCP address should work.</p><p>AP (WDS) -- STA (WDS) works really well between two ath9k devices such as these.</p>									</div>
