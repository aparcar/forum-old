					<p>Just so yall know I have contacted support to put in a trouble ticket to r &amp; d to get and contact with me because my $300 bad ass spec archer c3200 is bad ass paper weight. I have told them if they don&#039;t want to make this easy I will unlock it myself and show everybody how to do it. Then farther more I also requested the source code file witch I have for this router but I&#039;m currently trying to get my Linux box up to do all the editing for it. It is going to take me day based on the extraction in windows to find where they block third party support I might send it DD-WRT for there support but we will see what they say when&nbsp; the contact me. The tech support lady said they would get back to me on Monday 20170220 to find out more info about the lock out of third party software but for now I&#039;m going to have a good and drunk weekend and start the project next weekend. Ill let yall know a update from tplink r&amp;d to see if they will help with this or I&#039;m going to tell them I want my money back even though ive had it for more then 90 days and I&#039;m going to go get the Linksys wrt320acm</p>									</div>
