					<p>Hello everyone!</p><p>After installing the said new version (I had 15.05 installed before), I couldn&#039;t install mwan3 anymore. The error I got was lengthy, but this is the bit that sticks out:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> satisfy_dependencies_for: Cannot satisfy the following dependencies for luci-app-mwan3:
 *      kernel (= 3.18.20-1-521812ea85032e662b3d3469a3a10df8) *         kernel (= 3.18.20-1-521812ea85032e662b3d3469a3a10df8) *         kernel (= 3.18.20-1-521812ea85032e662b3d3469a3a10df8) *      kernel (= 3.18.20-1-521812ea85032e662b3d3469a3a10df8) *</code></pre></div><p>I installed mwan3 by force after that and it turns out, that wasn&#039;t such a good idea. The router no longer connects to the net (on any wan-port) and es practically unresponsive. I will try to downgrade now an see what happens.</p><p>Has anyone got any ideas for me concerning this? I haven&#039;t found any (release) that address this so far, but as it seems I am rather exotic in my usage of mwan3 anyways.</p><p>Best regards,<br />Cassi</p>									</div>
