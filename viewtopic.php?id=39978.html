					<p>I&#039;m a new user to the <a href="http://www.gargoyle-router.com/index.php">Gargoyle Router Management Utility</a> and love it&#039;s simplicity, ease of use and inbuilt logging ability.</p><p>My question is that, although the &#039;web monitoring&#039; is easy to implement, it only shows the domains visited and not the full page URL&#039;s.&nbsp; Is it possible to make it so the full URL&#039;s are logged rather than just the domain name?</p><p>I&#039;m no developer but if anybody could point me in the right direction if this can be achieved, I don&#039;t mind getting my hands dirty trying...</p><p>Thanks for any help with this.</p>									</div>
