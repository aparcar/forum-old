					<p>Hi. I don&#039;t know about 7.07 which is really old, but in trunk you can set the commandline when you run make menuconfig. However, I believe init=/etc/preinit is in there by default. Also the message about not being able to open an initial console can be ignored. Is that the last thing printed when it boots?</p>									</div>
