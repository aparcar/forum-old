					<p>I think my failsafe and normal partitions have somehow been kajigerred.</p><p>I&#039;ve been Googling and reading docs for a few hours, I need to go to sleep so I&#039;m going to drop my question here and hope someone can help. I apologize if I&#039;m making a silly mistake. </p><p>Background - I am brand new to OpenWRT. I have some limited networking experience, a little Linux knowledge (I can get around and do basic things easily), I like to tinker. I am a Windows guy though so a lot of this is beyond my depth.</p><p>I installed OpenWRT on my EA4500 following the Wiki here: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/ea4500#recent_trunk_builds_recommended">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/ea … ecommended</a>.</p><p>This was straightforward, it didn&#039;t take the firmware the first time but on the second time, it flashed and rebooted.</p><p>This is where the problems began.</p><p>I had already read that I would need to set a root password before being able to do much else. I was not able to access the router via ssh nor telnet. I used putty, pointed it at 192.168.1.1, nothing. Tried setting the username to root, nothing. Every time, I get &quot;No route to host&quot;. With telnet, there is a similar error, but I don&#039;t remember what it was. Windows will not let anything use the ethernet adapter because it thinks it&#039;s not connected. I don&#039;t have a console cable or a serial cable to try and dig deeper with this, but that should be unnecessary anyways, unless I&#039;m missing something very basic in the docs.</p><p>So I read more and found the failsafe mode, which works perfectly. I may have made a mistake here. I got logged in via ssh, set the root password, and ran mount_root. Then I installed LuCI from the shell following this guide: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials</a>; I ran everything up to and including the &#039;uhttpd enable&#039; command. Then I installed some other packages, and configured wifi and some other various settings. Then I thought to myself, you idiot, you&#039;re still in failsafe mode. So I rebooted just to see what would happen, of course, it was the same as last time, no way to get into the router.</p><p>So once again I booted to failsafe mode, except now all my configuration from before has remained. I took a backup of this config. I then ssh&#039;d in again, installed sftp server, and used WinSCP to grab the contents of /etc/config/ and /overlay/upper/etc/config/. I compared a hash of these files and they are all identical from /etc/ to /overlay/upper/etc/ - <strong>but this is all in failsafe mode</strong> - and I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s a problem.</p><p>I have an idea of what I&#039;ve done - I&#039;ve done all my configuration on the failsafe partition instead of the &quot;overlay&quot; partition, or user partition, or whatever it&#039;s called. Still learning here! </p><p>Anyways, I don&#039;t know what I need to do to swap this around so that I can reboot my router and not have a gimped version of OpenWRT. I&#039;m also concerned there may be security issues with running in failsafe mode 24/7. I am more than happy to give the contents of any files if it helps figure out what&#039;s going on here.</p><p>I&#039;m on Windows 10, have Putty, telnet, WinSCP, etc.</p><p>I also have a Raspberry Pi I could possibly use to configure the router from, if it&#039;s going to be vastly easier to do from Linux. </p><p>Thanks and again, sorry if this is a common problem or I&#039;ve made a stupid mistake - I&#039;ve searched and come up with nothing. Also interested to know how one would ssh into a router via IP (for the initial setup) if the router isn&#039;t routing... does one need a second router to do this, or console cable, or ... ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi shultz11588, have you tried booting into the working partition by forcing three failed boots? From the EA4500 wiki - </p><p>&quot;Note: No need for a 30/30/30 reset on this device. In the event of a bad flash, the router shall obviously fail to reboot but don&#039;t despair. After three consecutive failed reboots, the router then reverts back to its former working partition and boots normally. Based on this understanding, both EA4500 and E4200 v2 shall always have a partition with a working firmware.&quot;</p><p>So if you force three failed boots, it should boot into the working partition, if you&#039;ve only flashed OpenWrt once, the working partition it will boot into will be the stock firmware, i used that process on my EA3500 and it should be the same for the EA4500 which is very similar, i described it here - <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=329533#p329533">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 33#p329533</a></p><p>Or, if you can install packages in failsafe, you might try installing kmod-gpio-button-hotplug which will get your reset button working and just try a reset with the button, i think i&#039;d try booting into the working partition first though.</p>									</div>

					<p>I considered that, but I want to use openWRT, I&#039;m not really interested in using the stock firmware any longer. I could get back to stock and attempt to reflash, but I think I&#039;m maybe misunderstanding the initial login step. How can I ssh to the router if it&#039;s not routing? I am plugged in to Ethernet 1 via Ethernet cable, and the router is attached to the modem at the WLAN port. Do I have to do additional network config on the client I am configuring it from (windows 10)? Is there an easy way to detect the problem from within failsafe mode? I read that you must mount_root and compare the core config to the overlay, but when I do that they are the same. I&#039;d really like to have a way to get to the bottom of this issue and understand what I did wrong, or what the bug is, rather than keep reflashing or hack my way around the problem.</p><p>Not to say your advice isn&#039;t helpful, just not what I&#039;m looking for.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not familiar with the workings of failsafe yet unfortunately, i just started using OpenWrt recently myself, but our routers are very similar so i&#039;ll give a short walkthrough of my initial login/setup so you&#039;ll have something to compare against : </p><p>After installing OpenWrt i keep my router connected directly to my laptop with an ethernet cable going from one of the lan ports of the router to the ethernet port on my laptop, i&#039;m on linux so i then open a terminal and ssh into 192.168.1.1, on Windows you&#039;ll use Putty obviously, both our routers use the Designated Driver build (aka trunk) so there&#039;s no need to telnet or set a password, ssh will work directly from the beginning. Once i&#039;ve ssh&#039;ed into the router and have access to the settings, i go to etc/config/wireless and enable the wifi, then i restart wifi, then i reboot and ssh into the router again just to make sure everything stuck. If everything is fine at that point i&#039;ll disconnect the router from the laptop and connect it to my modem as normal, go back to my laptop and connect to the OpenWrt wifi, once i&#039;ve established internet connection i&#039;ll ssh back into the router, install all my packages and do all my configs and that&#039;s it, hope that helps.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mikemccartney</strong> on 13 Jul 2016, 01:28)</p>

					<p>Hi shultz11588,</p><p>I&#039;ve got an EA4500 (v1) with openwrt as well, and due to bad network settings I&#039;ve locked myself out. However no matter what combination of keys and timings, I cannot get the failsafe mode to be triggered. The only significant LED (the one on the front behind the logo) goes from fade - fast blink - slow blink - continuous light so not the failsafe blink pattern. Also, network sniffing does not show a magic packet, nor does pinging to 192.168.1.1 yield any result.<br />What am I doing wrong?</p><p>Thx</p>									</div>
