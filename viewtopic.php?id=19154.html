					<p>I am new to both Linux and OpenWRT, so I have two strikes right out the gate! I&#039;ve been running my web server on an Ubuntu Server command line system that I set up myself and I just started running Ubuntu 8.10 with GUI on a laptop, so I know a little bit - probably enough to be dangerous. </p><p>I flashed a Linksys WRT54G with Kamakaze 8.09 r14511 today and everything went smoothly. I can log into the router through a wired LAN connection using either http or telnet. So, everything works good.</p><p>Let me tell you what I want to do with this router and see if anyone can explain what I need and why:</p><p>I have a Pro-Lite PL-M2014r6 LED display sign that I want to program to display weather data as well as pre-programmed messages. I built a RJ11-DB9 interface cable and I plan to connect it to the DTE RS232 connector I installed in the router. So far, so good. Here&#039;s where it gets tricky (for me anyway!). I want the router to be able to download a text file from the internet that a program (I&#039;ll have to write it) can parse the text and then send the relevant portions to the sign. I want it (the router) to use a wireless connection to one of the routers that I already have set up and configured as servers, so I don&#039;t have to run any more cat5 cable. It already looks like a rat&#039;s nest in here. I don&#039;t think setting the WRT to server mode is what I want to do, but I can&#039;t decide whether client or ad-hoc mode is what I need and why. </p><p>Can someone tell me which mode I need for what I want to do and why? Also, Once it is set to either client or ad-hoc, will I still need to connect to the WRT with a wired LAN connection to access the LuCI interface or will I be able to do that wireless as well (and how if so)?</p><p>Thank you for your help in advance....</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rebeltaz</strong> on 1 Mar 2009, 23:54)</p>

					<p>I said that everything is running right... let me rephrase that. I seem to be missing some commands! I was trying to experiment with the serial port and, over a telnet connection, I tried running stty and setserial, but I get &quot;not found&quot; on both. So I tried installing them using &quot;ipkg update&quot; and &quot;ipkg install setserial&quot;. I get a &quot;not found&quot; error on ipkg as well. I tried &quot;wget <a href="http://tobe.mine.nu/software/openwrt/stty.tgz\">http://tobe.mine.nu/software/openwrt/stty.tgz&quot;</a> and I get a &quot;bad address&quot; error.</p><p>So apparently, I need more help than I thought!</p>									</div>
