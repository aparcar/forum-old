					<p>I have a Linksys E900 and flashed it with the openwrt-e900_v1-squashfs.bin , it&#039;s mainly working but it doesn&#039;t have any wireless capabilities.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been looking all over and trying to figure out what to install.&nbsp; In my /etc/config file, I don&#039;t have a wireless file, so it apparently didn&#039;t detect the BCM53572.&nbsp; I have LuCI installed and of course there&#039;s no reference to the wireless.</p><p>In my /etc/modules.d directory, I have 19-bgmac , as well as b43 and b43legacy.&nbsp; I thought the bgmac driver would be the one that would work, but obviously it isn&#039;t.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried restarting but that&#039;s pretty much the only thing I know how to do.</p><p>Please help!&nbsp; Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>

					<p>Zajec - Thank you so much for helping out with this!&nbsp; I think I need just a little bit more information, though.&nbsp; </p><p>How do I make sure that it is loading the bgmac driver instead of the others?&nbsp; And how do I get it to generate the wireless configuration file - that is, load the wireless driver and make it work?</p><p>Looking in the /etc/modules.d directory, it appears that bgmac is loaded, but I&#039;m only guessing that based on the fact that it has a number next to it (is this where it is in the boot sequence?)</p><p>I&#039;m concerned that if I use opkg to remove b43, b43legacy, and bgmac I will soft-brick the router.&nbsp; So here is what I&#039;m thinking about doing:</p><p>Remove all 3 (b43, b43legacy, and bgmac)<br />Install bgmac<br />Reboot</p><p>Do you think that will work?&nbsp; If not, what should I do?</p><p>Thanks again in advance!&nbsp; I really appreciate the help.</p><p>PS - I removed b43 and b43legacy, also b44.&nbsp; My /etc/modules-boot.d now shows:</p><p>17-pps<br />18-ptp<br />19-bgmac<br />20-tg3<br />30-gpio-button-hotplug<br />60-leds-gpio</p><p>I manually changed 19-tg3 to 20-tg3 to see if I could get bgmac to load first.&nbsp; So I&#039;m pretty confident that I have the right driver in place, but how do I get it to detect and configure the wireless now?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>emfitzgibbon</strong> on 28 Jan 2014, 18:07)</p>

					<p>I tried making an image using the imagegenerator with &quot;PROFILE=Broadcom-wl&quot; still doesn&#039;t work. As a results, I&#039;m flashing dd-wrt K3.x, works like a charm Lol.</p>									</div>
