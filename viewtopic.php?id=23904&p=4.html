					<p>This is my problem this time:</p><p>I reinstalled 10.03, the 2.6 kernel version on my WRT54GL. Everything ran fine until I started installen multiwan and the iptable packages.<br />Now, when I go to 192.168.1.1, I get a flash of the luci black screen referring me to <a href="http://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/luci">http://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/luci</a> and then POOF: can&#039;t connect to page.<br />What can the cause of that be?

					<p>I setup multiwan only for failover (I select wan instead of load balancer as default route). However, table 123 still has the balancing route. Is this an error in the scripts or I am doing something wrong?</p><p>edit: Nothing wrong with the above, table 123 always refers to load balancer, but if you use default route for one of wan interfaces, it uses the correct table (10 or 20 for two interfaces).</p><p>In order to use ipk files with imagebuilder, they have to be in tar.gz format. multiwan packages are in ar format and can&#039;t be used with imagebuilder.

					<p>ok, got everything up and running as it should. </p><p>dns is working properly and failover to ppp0 is also working. What i&#039;ve noticed is, and you may use my setup as a test environment if you wish, if system is booted .. ping to <a href="http://www.google.nl">www.google.nl</a> ...it nicely pings to that host. Pulling out the wan cable the route defaults to ppp0 within a second and the ping continues... but when bringing up the wan again is takes a long time (approx half hour) before the pings route through the wan again. (pings stay high cause of the ppp0/umts connection)</p><p>what i want to accomplish is that the ppp0 -&gt; wan failover works as fast as the wan -&gt; ppp0 failover</p><p>PM if you want access to this setup</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wvthoog</strong> on 2 May 2010, 23:28)</p>

					<p>Craig:<br />When when you moved from dualwan to multiwan, it looks like you stopped using the iptables statistic&nbsp; (or nth) module and you started using the weight option in &quot;ip route&quot; to distribute the traffic.&nbsp; I am assuming this is true because I couldn&#039;t find either of the matches mentioned in the 1.0.4 version of the multiwan script</p><br /><p>If that is true&nbsp; then&nbsp; due to the route cache, all connections made to the same destination address will use the same interface.&nbsp; &nbsp;So, for example,&nbsp; if you were opening pages on a single web server, only one interface would be used. </p><p>That is why the statistic match in iptables is a better approach. </p><p>Secondly, you mentioned that you did not have 2 wan lines to test your script.&nbsp; If that is still the case, you can try something I did in the past. <br />I took another router (with openwrt).
