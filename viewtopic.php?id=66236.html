					<p>Hello, I&#039;m having some issue while setting my new Linksys&nbsp; wrt 1900acs running CC on a custom user build with luci ( david&#039;s one)</p><p>The network is the following.</p><p>INTERNET ====&gt;&nbsp; modem router from isp&nbsp; ==== ( dmz to 192.168.1.100) ===&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;1900ACS<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;all setting are off <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ( no firewall, no dhcp, just a dmz)</p><br /><p>The final result is to have 2/3 separate network:<br />- a home network with wifi and wired devices<br />- a guest network with just wifi<br />- a printer that is shared between the 2 network ( if I read correctly it should be doable with just 1 firewall rule, not sure which one in my setup).</p><p>I&#039;ve tried many things ending in not having wifi working/ dhcp issue, no internet on wifi, no internet on wired...</p><p>SOoooo. let me ask a few questions....</p><p>1. the wan interface is setted with a static IP 192.168.1.100 which has the same class as the ISP router ( that has a dmz rule on that IP ), the gateway is setted as 192.168.1.254 ( ISP&#039;s router IP ), with google dns<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; is this correct? the DHCP is off, is this correct ? <br />2. should i give the LAN interface and GUEST interface a different class of IP from WAN ? and between them? ( i would say YES...)<br />3. my LAN interface has a static IP of 192.168.3.1, google dns, no gateway, dhcp active;&nbsp; what should be the gateway ?&nbsp; is it OK? <br />4. my GUEST interface has a static IP of 192.168.5.1, google dns, no gateway, dhcp active;&nbsp; what should be the gateway ? is it OK? <br />5. the wireless has 4 network: 2 lan interface and 2 on guest interface, setted as AP ,&nbsp; OK ? <br />6. the firewall zone/ rules of guest are setted as <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan-webinterface,">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/gu â€¦ interface,</a> OK ? <br />( all netmask are 255.255.255.0)</p><p>Re-capping...<br />It&#039;s so bad to have 3 different subnetwork on the router? It&#039;s CPU hogger? or Is it correct/ the only way to achieve this?</p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>
