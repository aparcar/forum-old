					<p>First of all, i am new here. Thank you for accepting me on the forum.</p><p>I am playing with my TPlink Archer C7 V2, and several firmwares for it. Also i have read a lot about editing them, and i am familiar with using a HEX editor.</p><p>The only thing that i can&#039;t manage to do is calculating the valid new checksum after editing the binaries.<br />My HEX editor can calculate several types of checksums, but the results are not the right ones.</p><p>When reading for days, one important tool that keeps coming back is &quot;mktplinkfw&quot;, and in particular to calculate the right checksum. But that doesnt work in Windows. </p><p>i have tried almost anything to compile it with coding tools for Windows, but i have almost no experience in coding, and get all kind of new problems when trying to get a working executable.</p><p>I installed Git, Github Desktop, MinGW, Visual Studio , CodeBlocks. I read loads of tutorials, tips, but i still cant get the job done. I understand that using Linux would solve a lot, but i have no experience at all with that.</p><p>Could anyone please advise me what to do?</p>									</div>

If the folder where the executable is is found from your PATH variable, then the shell (terminal) does this prefixing for you.</p><p>If the folder is not in your PATH variable, then you need to use the absolute or relative path to the executable.
