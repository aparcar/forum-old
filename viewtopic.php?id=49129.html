					<p>I have the misfortune of being on an ISP who hijacks, alters, and manipulates DNS queries. In this case, it&#039;s Century Link DSL in the United States. If a domain does not exist, they redirect you to their own advertisement-ridden search page, rather than return the proper NXDOMAIN result. This is commonly know as NX domain hijacking.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_hijacking">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_hijacking</a></p><p>My router is running OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment 12.09.</p><p>On my luci web UI, I have the following settings:<br />Network &gt; DHCP and DNS &gt; &quot;DNS forwardings&quot;<br />This setting is described as, &quot;List of DNS servers to forward requests to&quot;.</p><p>I have Google&#039;s DNS servers listed here.</p><p>However, from both my hosts behind this router and from the router&#039;s own command line, if I do something like &quot;dig -t A foo.bar @myrouter.lan&quot;, it is obviously still using the Century Link toxic DNS servers, instead of the servers I have configured.</p><p>These Century Link DNS servers were getting to my router from it&#039;s WAN port DHCP client, and this appears to be overriding the dnsmasq settings. I would argue that this is wrong.</p><p>It would be right the that local host itself use those DHCP DNS settings, but certainly not hosts using the dnsmasq DNS proxy service from the LAN interface.</p><p>The offending file in this case is in &quot;/tmp/resolv.conf.auto&quot;, which had the Century Link toxic DNS servers in it. Why dnsmasq was using these and not the forwarder addresses for which it was configured, I do not understand.</p><p>One way to fix the problem is to manually configure the WAN interface DHCP client to ignore DNS servers and use a manual list. This can be done via the Luci UI:<br />Network &gt; Interfaces &gt; WAN &gt; Common Configuration &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; &quot;Use DNS servers advertised by peer&quot;. Uncheck this box and put different DNS servers in.</p><p>I don&#039;t know dnsmasq very well, but it should never have been using DNS servers for which it was not configured, while ignoring configured forwarders.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jmomo</strong> on 21 Feb 2014, 07:16)</p>

					<p>Just to make it clear, dnsmasq is completely ignoring DNS forwarders. They do nothing, ever. dnsmasq is always using the nameservers specified by &quot;resolv-file&quot;, which points to &quot;/tmp/resolv.conf.auto.&nbsp; I am not sure how &quot;resolv.conf.auto&quot; is generated.</p><p>ps says the dnsmasq binary is being called via:<br />/usr/sbin/dnsmasq -C /var/etc/dnsmasq.conf</p>									</div>

					<p>The way you identified as workaround is actually the canonical solution for changing NS servers.</p><p>You&#039;re overthinking it. Instead of keeping broken dns servers and then fix them by applying a set of forwarding rules on top, simply disable the broken servers at the source and add your own.</p><p>This way you do not need to deal with &quot;obscure application specific syntax&quot;.<br />Your &quot;solution&quot; would for example fail in cases where dnsmasq is not even used (router itself would still use broken ISP DNS servers).</p><p>Also DNS forwardings where not really meant to direct all DNS traffic to another upstream server. They&#039;re intended to route specific domains to alternative servers, e.g. to map *.company.org to an intranet DNS server or similar.</p>									</div>
