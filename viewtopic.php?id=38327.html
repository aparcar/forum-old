					<p>Hello</p><p>I have the WR703N already flashed (as a matter of fact this is the second WR703N I have working with OpenWrt), but I want to use it for adding wireless functionality to other device that only has RJ45 ethernet. So I want to configure the WR703N as a wireless client that could provide ethernet on the LAN port to other device that has no wireless interface. If possible I want to use dynamic IP addressing for both the WR703N and for the other device, using an existing DHCP server on the network (I have it already working on other OpenWrt router). Can you give me any tip to help in the WR703N network configuration?</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Fernando</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks! I will try it! </p><p>I have used in the past the SMCWEB-N AP/Ethernet Client configured as a wireless client, I had only to configure it with an IP address of my LAN and the SSID of the wireless network to connect to, and it worked exactly the way I want, extending the network to the devices connected to its RJ45 ethernet ports. Is it possible to configure the WR703N with OpenWrt the same way? Or is the SMCWEB-N using the Broadcom specific &quot;Bridged client&quot; mode? The receipe you proposed have a similar result, except having to configure a Client Subnet that in the end is not used. As I want to make it as simple as possible to others to configure, this &#039;unused&#039; subnet configuration is not easy to explain. I can try to select a unlikely default configuration for this subnet to not colide with the main AP subnet, but there is always the risk of someone to configure the same network address on the main network, making this setup fail... Except for this situation the receipe you proposed fits my needs :-)</p><p>Fernando</p>									</div>
