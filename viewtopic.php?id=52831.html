					<p>Hello, <br />I seem to be a bit stuck and I am in need of some help<br />I am trying to swap out my old BT HomeHub 2 running r34686 of openwrt with my new one (running r41815). The old one works fine, and indeed is providing my internet connection at the moment. Unfortunately the new one does not work, the WAN interface does not connect and therefore I do not have an internet connection<br />The modem connects okay but the wan interface isn&#039;t coming up. I get the following via logread<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Wed Sep 17 20:23:51 2014 daemon.notice netifd: Interface &#039;wan&#039; is setting up now
Wed Sep 17 20:23:51 2014 daemon.info pppd[4234]: Plugin pppoatm.so loaded.

Wed Sep 17 20:23:51 2014 daemon.info pppd[4234]: Exit.</code></pre></div><p>and it keeps trying while the ADSL connection is up. <br />Can someone please give me some pointers to look at, I&#039;ve run out of ideas. <br />I don&#039;t know if this is relevant but to save time I&#039;ve got both HH connected on the network with different IPs and I&#039;m switching the ADSL connection between them. I did try with just the new one, but without the internet I can&#039;t find out how to fix it. <br />Thanks<br />Anthony</p>									</div>

The bb-rc3 image for the BTHOMEHUBV2B is too big for its
mtd partition. This patch corrects the partition sizes in
the device tree. This patch should really go in before
bb-final, otherwise the BTHOMEHUBV2B images won&#039;t be useable.
I do apologise for not spotting this straight away.</code></pre></div><p>This is the one I had seen. Might explain your problem.</p><p>It will be in the next bb release candidate.</p>									</div>
