					<p>I have been reading posts, FAQs, Docs, etc for days now - and I still need help.</p><p>I have a TP-Link TL-WR1043ND router (supported).</p><p>I am trying to set up a wifi hotspot using CoovaChilli.</p><p>I *have* installed Open-WRT a couple of times (and switched back to factory, and tried DD-WRT as well).</p><p>After installing the Open-WRT I connected to the router and found the LuCi interface - less than helpful.&nbsp; I found no way to configure the basics of the router (wireless, WPA2, etc).</p><p>Can someone, please, tell me what I need to do to get my router configured and CoovaChilli (preferably the newest version) installed?</p><p>This is NOT a Coova question - I already know how to configure Coova - I just don&#039;t know how to get my router working with Open-WRT to start with!&nbsp; LoL</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>luci is pretty helpful, since you can configure the whole system with it. you dont need to install any packages at all - they are all included in the basic firmware. but you SHOULD probably telnet into your device and set a password after a fresh installation.</p><p>if you did that, go where jow pointed you in luci and you can setup all wireless features. luci is pretty simple - but sure it requires you to know what you are doing. what you perhaps miss is a &quot;setup wizzard&quot; - but thank god, openwrt doesnt have such crap.</p><p>another option (AFTER setting the password via telnet) - log into luci, switch from essentials to administration (upper right) and go to every menu topic available. oh - and allow javascript - else you might miss most submenus</p>									</div>

					<p>oh - how could i forget - when you are done and satisfied with all this, you have to compile coovachilli yourself - which includes creating a buildchain. perhaps you can use chillspot instead of coovachilli</p>									</div>
