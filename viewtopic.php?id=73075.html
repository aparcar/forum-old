					<p>I can start CPE by rebooting the device with the reset button held down. The router then provides ethernet service on &quot;1 9 2 local address&quot; that enables me to access the h t t p interface where the only option is to (re)upload the image. I can do that and although it states that and looks like it flashes - nothing seems to change.</p>									</div>

					<p>By default eth0 is in br-lan and would use that bridge interface&#039;s IP address.&nbsp; You should be able to ping and ssh to the router over Ethernet at 192.168.1.1.&nbsp; But... the trunk builds do not have a web interface.&nbsp; See if there is a LEDE 17.01.4 build for that model and use it instead.&nbsp; That will be a newer version and include web interface.</p>									</div>

					<p>Like most routers, there is one Ethernet port from the CPU which passes through an Ethernet switch to the cables.&nbsp; These two functions are on the same chip, but logically separate.&nbsp; The switch supports VLANs though, so you can separate the physical ports on the back to separate networks.&nbsp; &nbsp;Once the switch is configured with VLANs, the networks will be accessed as eth0.1, eth0.2, etc.</p>									</div>
