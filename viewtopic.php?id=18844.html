					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a odd problem. Linux and Mac Clients can connect to my router, IP is OK i even can use webif but they have no internet connection.<br />Windows clients have full access. <br />My config&nbsp; is Asus Wl500gp x-wrt snapshot with coovachilli hotspotsoftware. Unfortunatly I don&#039;t get any help from coovas very unpopulated forum at the moment so I try here. <br />I have a lot of those in SysLog<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Feb  8 20:08:47 OpenWrt daemon.warn dnsmasq[7212]: no address range available for DHCP request via br-wifi</code></pre></div><p>As I understand it, Coova is supposed to do the DHCP, and this works as well. As I said, I can connect to see webif.<br />If I disable coova (which gives me an IP in the range 192.168.182.0 which 192.168.182.1 is the internal IP for the hotspot ) and connect directly to using an IP like 10.11.0.2 (the wlan is set to 10.11.0.1) everything works fine. </p><p>DNS lookup is not the problem.</p><p>IF i type in ping <a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a> the IP adress is shown on my linux host. but then this error is shown:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>icmp_seq=1 Destination Port Unreachable</code></pre></div><p>I have no clou why this works from windows</p><p>Cheers seballa</p><p>Thanks for your help<br />Seballa</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>seballa</strong> on 8 Feb 2009, 23:23)</p>
