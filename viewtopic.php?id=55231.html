					<p>honestly i have no idea what is the pem or der format but the author of the <br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/certificates.overview">Wiki</a> is talking about &quot;ascii-armored PEM&quot; which sounds like base64 encoded and the &quot;binary DER format used by uhttpd&quot;.</p><br /><p>@zo0ok: i have no idea what you are talking about (dont get me wrong, its a lack of my knowledge <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /> )</p><p>@krikkit: MAYBE you were using the exact same &quot;wrong&quot; combined certificate and just didnt notice it yet?<br />The resulting certificate is working on chrome/firefox/... perfectly just chrome on android (this is the only place it occured to me) throws an error ...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Volle</strong> on 22 Jan 2015, 01:27)</p>

					<p>stunnel is a little program, that is available for OpenWRT. It simply listens to ports you choose and forwards the traffic to services you choose. In the process it adds SSL/TLS (or whatever the correct term is). So if you have uhttpd listening to http on port 80, you can use stunnel to listen to 443/https, and it will SSL/TLS layer and forward to port 80.</p><p>It can also be used to get encryption on protocols like IMAP.</p><p>As I understand it, the client will be just fine with this - it will be proper https.</p><p>If you need to produce working certificates, just any self signed working certificates, the OpenVPN-wiki-article contains very good instructions how to use easy-rsa package to produce certificates:<br />wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.openvpn</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi.</p><p>I was trying to set up uhttpd with startcom certificate too. I&#039;m on Barrier Breaker r42625.</p><p>Once you set the &#039;listen_https&#039; directive, px5g will generate a cert and a key for you, and the site should be up.</p><p>Before that, I put the cert and the key from my PKI to /etc/uhttpd.*, thinking uhttpd will grab and use them. Site was down, and log showed &#039;instance is in a crash loop&#039;. I then removed my files, px5g was able to do its job and site went up.</p><p>I tried pointing to other locations then, and it just led to px5g trying to create its files there and successfully crashing. I looked up the init script, but was unable to figure out what&#039;s going on there. I commented out the whole &#039;config cert &#039;px5g&#039; part with no luck.</p><p>zo0ok. You are the hero. stunnel kicks ass. It took me 10 minutes to set it up and I happily went to sleep.</p><p>krikkit, I followed your instructions to create .der file, and it worked fine. Thank you for this too.</p>									</div>
