					<p>Hello,<br />I am trying to unbrick my router and I ran into some hardware trouble which I guess can be solved with a little hint from wireless gurus of this forum. I have an ASUS GT32 (Ralink version, guess it&#039;s B1) and I&#039;m trying to access it with a custom made serial cable. The cable is made using Nokia CA-42, it has 3 wires (RX,TX, GND) and I tested its work by making a loopback. I put screen on 115200 baud, no flow control on ttyUSB0. Then I connect the cable to the router, and it gives gibberish when it&#039;s off. I power on the router, it seems to load something and wait (it keeps rebooting itself without the cable inserted, I can say by the led state) for input but the output is just blank. What am I doing wrong?</p>									</div>

					<p>Two thoughts:</p><p>1. It&#039;s still possible that you have RX and TX reversed (loopback would still work).&nbsp; You can verify the router&#039;s TX pin with a speaker -- you&#039;ll hear it when it&#039;s sending characters to the UART.&nbsp; Or just reverse your connections and try it ...</p><p>2. Make sure your comm program is not sending modem initialization strings etc. on startup.&nbsp; You want &quot;offline mode&quot;.</p>									</div>

					<p>Tried to reverse 1 pin (can&#039;t make it out without splitting back the connector <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> ) tried each but still silence. Or should it work when BOTH TX and RX are connected?<br />My program is screen. Guess it doesnt send anything at all</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi again,<br />I resoldered the cable and verified the voltages. GND-TX is 3.3V GND-RX is 2.5V, so the cable is not to be blamed. GND on cable goes to GND slot on router, VCC slot on router is unconnected, RX-TX I have tested in both combinations. <br />Combination1: gibberish when powered on<br />Combination2: silence when powered on<br />Any further guidance?</p>									</div>
