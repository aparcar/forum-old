					<p>Has any one found the jtag connection points on a wrt600n? I realize that there is no standard jtag header as shown on the fcc pictures. I would think that the connections would be available somewhere on the pcb.</p>									</div>

					<p>This is all I&#039;ve ever seen, but it&#039;s about the serial port. So check those connections off your list! It&#039;s a shame that WRT600n has such vague support. I thought it was a good platform with most anything people would want.

					<p>Thanks for the reply.. I am aware of the serial port.</p><p>The jtag is a function of the processor.. I believe the traces just need to be found. They may not exist. The processor connections may terminate on blank pads. There are several pieces of hardware that do not have an official jtag port but the connection points have been found. Usually somewhere around the processor on one or the other end of an smt resistor marked 427 (maybe 472??).</p><p>I just though someone may know..</p><p>Thanks for the response.</p>									</div>
