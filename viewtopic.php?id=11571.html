					<p>hardware: asus wl-hdd installing a 80g hd inside, xbox<br />software: whiterussian 0.9, samba server, ftp server<br />i have many files&nbsp; with chinese filename on smb share disk, in whiterussian filename display ok. and also normal when i list them in windows. but when i use xbmc (a media play on xbox) to open smb share. the filename cannot be displayed normally. but the file can be played, deleted. if i use ftp protocol to open ftp share disk (same as samba share disk), the chinese filename displayed ok. btw, i already installed chinese font in xbmc.<br />it seems like the problem caused by samba, anyone has solution?</p>									</div>
