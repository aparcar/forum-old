					<p>Helo Evrybody</p><p>A whant to use OpenWRT for my platform, but I have certian requirement for this. So before I create my system I whant to ask what to expect from serwer http installed into OpenWRT.&nbsp; Generaly my Platform it contains&nbsp; MT7620a and 128MB RAM MCU. I whant lunch big html page on this platform. It means I whant to creat ubi image , which contains my page and all root file system. Additionality maybe something else (daemon). My page use this technology</p><p>Compatible With&nbsp; &nbsp; Bootstrap 3.x (Based on Twitter Bootstrap 3.3 Framework)<br />HTML Files<br />CSS Files<br />JS Files<br />Responsive design</p><br /><p>and maybe this</p><br /><p>1170 px Site Width<br />Retina Ready<br />PHP Fils<br />HTML 5 Files<br />CSS Files<br />JS Files<br />google fonts<br />Responsive design<br />jQuery Powered<br />Working Ajax Contact Form</p><p>So tell me, whether uhttpd is be good for my page ? And whether all technology they will be handled ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>EbdWRT</strong> on 4 May 2015, 12:43)</p>

					<div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>So tell me, whether uhttpd is be good for my page ? And whether all technology they will be handled ?</p></blockquote></div><p>This question cannot be answered because of several (!) reasons:</p><p>- Responsive and &quot;all technology&quot; is very vague<br />- strictly speaking: responsive &quot;guarantees&quot;: means some sort of Realtime<br />- performance varies WIDELY between Platforms/Chipsets/Compile settings that are possible</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; * Compiling with -O3 might behave differently from normal -Os<br />- There are no serious Benchmarks for OpenWrt available - feel free to create one/one test protocol<br />- see <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/benchmark.usb">usb</a> or <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/benchmark.openssl">openssl</a> benchmark pages in wiki<br />- Embedded systems are often design with specific goals - there is no &quot;all round&quot; System because of Hardware design limits and trade-offs: USB performance, Wireless performance, power consumptions, attachable GPIOs, I2C performance, other bus that are attached (I2C, Multimedia), NAT perfomance, DSP integration ... so this has to be taken into account when developing on embedded systems</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>So before I create my system I whant to ask what to expect from serwer http installed into OpenWRT</p></blockquote></div><p>This totally depends - How many users, &quot;hostile environment&quot; , USB or Wifi enabled / active /how many clients there etc. - see above</p><p>Notice that there are several projects like Piratebox and possibly others that do offer web services from OpenWrt nodes, run nginx etc. but from very different HW / usability povs.</p><br /><p>PS: Example: If I enable &quot;security&quot; on OpenWrt - performance of USB copies etc. gets lowered to low single digit Mbyte/s. I consider this &quot;not responsive&quot; compared to 20Mb/s that are max. possible.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zloop</strong> on 4 May 2015, 13:15)</p>

I can&#039;t this explain more simply.<br />I can add that, I try create something similar to interface between user and system. This interface is just my web page. I the same time can be log only one user on site.&nbsp; My goal in my system is create device as acces point for max 5 clients, and for this was wirten above (interface via web browser)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>EbdWRT</strong> on 4 May 2015, 15:24)</p>

					<p>I think you can actually install Apache on a router, but you will need a lot of RAM and CPU to run Java.&nbsp; The little MIPS chip isn&#039;t going to have much performance.&nbsp; Suggest a standard PC or a small x86 box.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, uHTTPd can execute PHP, although in CGI mode which might or might not provide sufficient performance, see <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/uhttpd#using_php5">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/uhttpd#using_php5</a></p><p>PHP5 is a bad choice for embeded systems imho due to its rather high ram requirements so maybe evaluate smaller alternatives for the backend.</p><p>HTML, Javascript and CSS are static assets, the choice of the webserver on the backend does not matter for that.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for all reply.&nbsp; Now I undertsood certian issues. I have also alternative. This alternative is ARM MCU, &gt;1GHz and much more RAM. I think about MIPS and MT product because this MCU&nbsp; provided embedded wirreles modules in chip, where I use my favorit ARM I must include additionality wi-fi module.</p>									</div>

					<p>You could serve the static stuff from the small MT7620, and create the dynamic part (PHP) on another, larger server.<br />OR put everyhing onto a bigger server in the background, and use squid with careful config on the MT7620, to cache your static data/part of dynamic data. Performance&nbsp; should be similar as served from apache on the MT7620.<br />Some of your &quot;tasks&quot; are done within the browser, anyway, like &quot;Responsive Design&quot;, which usually depends upon JS and CSS.</p>									</div>

					<p><strong>augustus_meyer</strong><br />This is to much expensive solution for me. In this case maybe I must resign with MIPS, and take ARM, since when I test example page on platform&nbsp; with ARM (armv7) evrythings worked ok.</p>									</div>
