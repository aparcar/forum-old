					<p>Hi,<br />Re flashed firmware OpenWrt in to Tp-Link Wr841n, did this in Linux mint and went ok for a day got connections...I struggled doing this as it seemed different to the install wiki, I couldn&#039;t get up a Terminal except the native Linux terminal.<br />Yesterday I opened up OpenWrt on 192.168.1.1....explored a few settings but lost wifi and Internet ...no matter what I did I couldn&#039;t get the connections back...I was following the wiki but no luck....eventually I couldn&#039;t even log in with 192.168.1.1...obviously I have&nbsp; made mistakes and the router is useless... sort of got connected this morning but was dropping out every 15 minutes.<br />Today I connected up with another router so have Internet again, however rather than giving up I thought I would keep going with this router and OpenWrt.<br />The main reason I am doing this is to have Ad-block at the router so I can watch you-tube on my tablet with out adds when I&#039;m wifi through my router.<br />So my thoughts are to replace the flash chip with 8Mb one, reinstall OpenWrt and put back in the system as an access point...leave the other router and access point as they are...there working fine.<br />Any suggestions would be appreciated and maybe if I will flash with windows I might have more success...I can&#039;t explain the frustrating time and the many hours trying to do this in Linux...I thought it would be okay but as I say might have all been me.<br />Cheers.</p>									</div>
