					<p>Hi, had to reinstall win8.1 two days back. <br />In my home office I have TP-Link router running dd-wrt connected to the DSL.<br />In the lounge I have a wired-HooToo (using dd-wrt gateway)&nbsp; running OpenWrt as an AP for the TV/Push2TV etc.<br />All works well.<br />But...<br />I no longer have the IP for the HooToo to access OpenWrt Luci.<br />I can connect to the HooToo via wifi and get Internet access as can the TV etc.<br />Via HooToo wifi I do an IPConfig and it shows an IP address with the correct gateway and subnet.<br />When I use that IP in the browser it cannot connect.<br />I unplugged the dd-wrt and plugged the HooToo directly into the PC and ipconfig again showed an IP but different from the wifi connection IP.<br />I tried that IP in a browser and still no Luci.<br />I really don&#039;t want to do a hard reset and start again as I can&#039;t locate the last backup I made after setting up the HooToo about a year back. It has been working flawlessly since then. <br />But...<br />I&#039;d like to get the IP in case I need to do some changes. At worst I can reset the HooToo back to 192.168.1.1 or whatever the OpenWrt resorts to, but I remember spending a lot of time setting the thing up as an AP and want to try everything before doing that.</p><p>Where do I go from here?</p><p>Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MyNewRouter</strong> on 5 Jan 2016, 01:06)</p>

I have a lot of HooToo backups but none of them show the correct gateway. I always include the gateway in the backup title.</p><p>I guess I could just hard reset and then install each backup until I find it. BUT - if I don&#039;t find the correct backup I will have wiped the currently working one. Best to leave it alone for now.</p><p>Thanks for the suggestion though.</p>									</div>
