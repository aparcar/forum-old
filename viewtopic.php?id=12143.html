					<p>Trying to partition and format a 300 GB USB attached hard drive.</p><p>Having partitioned the drive as follows:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Disk /dev/scsi/host1/bus0/target0/lun0/disc: 300.0 GB, 300090728448 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 36483 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes

                                 Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/scsi/host1/bus0/target0/lun0/part1               1          32      257008+  82  Linux swap / Solaris

/dev/scsi/host1/bus0/target0/lun0/part4            2773       36483   270783607+   5  Extended
/dev/scsi/host1/bus0/target0/lun0/part5            2773       36480   270759478+  83  Linux</code></pre></div><p>Partition 2 and 3 formats just fine with mke2fs -j /dev/scsi/host1/bus0/target0/lun0/part2 and mke2fs -j /dev/scsi/host1/bus0/target0/lun0/part3.<br />However, when trying to format partition 5, I get the following error:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# mke2fs -j /dev/scsi/host1/bus0/target0/lun0/part5
mke2fs 1.39 (29-May-2006)
/dev/scsi/host1/bus0/target0/lun0/part5: Memory allocation failed while setting up superblock</code></pre></div><p>I&#039;ve tried both using a primary partition as part4, and as above an extended partition and then within that, a Linux partition. Same problem.<br />Funny thing is that it seems that the bug is size dependent. If I create part5 to be 100 GB the formatting works, whereas 250 GB or the remaining part of the disk gives the error above.<br />So somewhere in between there seem to be a limit... Is&nbsp; this by design or an error? Or am I doing something wrong? <br />I&#039;ve used the same disk in WhiteRussian without problems, so this behaviour seems to be new to Kamikaze.</p><p><em><br />Edit:<br />150GB in part5 works fine and can be formatted, whereas 200GB doesn&#039;t.<br />part1 is 256 MB<br />part2 is 11 GB<br />part3 is 11 GB<br /></em></p><p>Thanks,<br />-MN</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mountaindude</strong> on 18 Aug 2007, 19:06)</p>

					<p>Hi there,</p><p>I had the same problem. It seems that mke2fs needs enough memory to build the partition table in memory. After that the partition can be created without any problems.</p><p>What I did to get my partition formatted is, I created a swap partition (following instructions from <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/LocalFileSystemHowTo)">http://wiki.openwrt.org/LocalFileSystemHowTo)</a> to extend my physical memory.</p><p>After doing that mke2fs worked like a charm.</p><p>Regards</p><p>TAnderson</p>									</div>
