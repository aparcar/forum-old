					<p>Hello</p><p>I like having the newest build for my router. And for example if am happy with the config with which were compiled the FW`s in the download section (on the openwrt.org site), where can I find those configs? Are those the configs that are in each folder for the specific architecture? For example if I look at the /brcm47xx/ folder (on the openwrt.org site), there is a OpenWrt.config. Was that the config that was used to build the FW`s in the folder?</p><p>When I want to build a new/custom build, this my procedure:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>svn co svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk/
cd trunk
./scripts/feeds update
make V=99 defconfig
make V=99 package/symlinks</code></pre></div><p>then:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>make menuconfig
make V=99 world</code></pre></div><p>Is that a good procedure? I got it from the forum - I got allot help there <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I presume that make V=99 defconfig makes the default config. Now, what is the difference with that config and configs that are in every folder on the openwrt.org download site? Is the difference only in the architecture?</p><p>Sorry if I asked stupid questions, but somehow I like having that config and then add/remove modules - if I need a special build.</p><p>regards,<br />vedro</p>									</div>

					<p>The downloadable config files are largely the same as the default config you get when just selecting architecture and maybe profile in menuconfig.<br />Release config files additionally enable LuCI.</p>									</div>
