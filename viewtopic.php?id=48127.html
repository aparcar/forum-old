					<p>PC sharing internet? Why not another openwrt router?</p><p>You will have to configure the wr740n as wifi client. Probably the easiest way is to make wds bridge, but you will have to enable wds on both sides. Then you will assign eth0 to lan bridge and disable wan. If you can&#039;t use wds, you will have to assign wan to wifi instead of eth0 and eth0 bridge to lan. This will do another nat, which is better to avoid, but it probably won&#039;t hurt for tv. You can read more here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedclient">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedclient</a> If you can&#039;t use wds, best is to use bridge using relayd, but it is a bit harder to configure.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 1 Jan 2014, 18:36)</p>
