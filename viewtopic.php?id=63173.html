					<p>Apologies if this has already been answered somewhere - I searched using Google, but couldn&#039;t find a topic that covered what I&#039;m seeing.</p><p>I&#039;m experienced with OpenWRT - have used it for years, and currently have it running on a WNDR3800.&nbsp; I used to build my own for a DIR-825 B1, and use an x86 build in my virtual machine lab.</p><p>But this has me stumped.</p><p>Following the instructions at <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-600">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-600</a> using the openwrt-15.05-ar71xx-generic-dir-601-b1-squashfs-factory.bin image (md5sum checks out OK for it).&nbsp; I&#039;m flashing through the recovery mode web interface using Chrome on Linux (I don&#039;t have any Windows systems).</p><p>The upload proceeds, reaches 100% and says the upgrade was successful, but the router doesn&#039;t reboot on its own.&nbsp; If I reboot it myself, I end up back in the stock D-Link firmware with the configuration I&#039;d been using.</p><p>Any ideas about what I need to do to get this device flashed with Chaos Calmer?</p>									</div>

					<p>I had a look through that thread, but didn&#039;t see anything relating to the issue I&#039;m having.</p><p>I just tried flashing the NA image as well (since the router reports the current firmware is 2.01NA), but still no luck getting the flashed firmware to actually work.</p>									</div>
