					<p>Hey guys,</p><p>There are a few issues here in no particular order. (1) Yes, the packages I originally posted were for brcm47xx architecture. (2) The second thing is that I would first download these packages and then install. (3) The third issue is that you must ensure that the other PBX packages and all asterisk18 packages are removed first, as the new packages don&#039;t deal with this (yet).</p><p>E.g., please try the following. To clean up:</p><p>opkg update<br />opkg remove luci-app-pbx luci-app-pbx-voicemail<br />opkg remove $(opkg list | grep asterisk18 | awk &#039;{print $1}&#039;)</p><p>To download the packages:</p><p>wget <a href="http://iiordanov.com/files/pbx/luci-app-pbx-11.ipk">http://iiordanov.com/files/pbx/luci-app-pbx-11.ipk</a><br />wget <a href="http://iiordanov.com/files/pbx/luci-app-pbx-voicemail-11.ipk">http://iiordanov.com/files/pbx/luci-app … ail-11.ipk</a></p><p>To install:</p><p>opkg install luci-app-pbx-11.ipk<br />opkg install luci-app-pbx-voicemail-11.ipk</p><p>Tell me whether this worked better <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Cheers!<br />iordan</p>									</div>

Thank you again for your hard work, brilliance, and overall kindness. </p><p>For anyone who hasn&#039;t followed Dancho&#039;s work on this I just want to say it is the most user friendly way to start a home PBX I&#039;ve seen. I&#039;ve tried a lot of things and most cause a normal person to give up over the complexity of the installation or network configuration. Dancho has made this so easy to use and deserves recognition. I have incoming/outgoing GTalk &amp; SIP local number, outgoing VoipBusterPro long distance, and free incoming local numbers located in neighboring province/state and from the UK all working from a single phone extension.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>silicone</strong> on 17 May 2014, 19:35)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m still having a problem with incoming calls - they get rejected and instantly trigger the SIP providers voice mail path. I&#039;ve tried numerous suggestions to address this problem around the web but none of them work or seem to apply given this is a later version Asterisk or that it is resident on the router itself versus a computer behind with NAT issues (unsure if this is relevant or how to troubleshoot it right now). Any advice is appreciated.</p><p>I note that the .conf files are completely written over on each reboot by the contents of the templates. Changes to settings like insecure or qualify are therefore not maintained so troubleshooting involves editing the template files.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>silicone</strong> on 17 May 2014, 19:35)</p>

					<p>Hi, I communicate in this way because I have not been able to run a asterisk in openwrt. My goal is very simple. make Asterisk dial a number and play a message. I really ask for help in this way because I do not understand despite having read days about setting asterisk. I need to know how to connect to an account camundanet.com</p><p>in summary, I have two problems ... a) Connect to sip account camundanet b) make openwrt dial a telephone number and playing an audio message.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nesch.consulting</strong> on 28 Mar 2015, 03:16)</p>

I have only added for some sip a specific user... the result is that the user account will no more ring...<br />Anyone have some suggestion?</p>									</div>
