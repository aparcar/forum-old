					<p>The option --dhcp-script seems to be NOT implemented in the dnsmasq version 2.47 on Kamikaze as it is not doing anything... any clue about this? </p><div class="quotebox"><cite>Dnsmasq in the manual page about dhcp-script wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>-6 --dhcp-script=&lt;path&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Whenever a new DHCP lease is created, or an old one destroyed, the executable specified by this option is run. &lt;path&gt; must be an absolute pathname, no PATH search occurs. The arguments to the process are &quot;add&quot;, &quot;old&quot; or &quot;del&quot;, the MAC address of the host, the IP address, and the hostname, if known. &quot;add&quot; means a lease has been created, &quot;del&quot; means it has been destroyed, &quot;old&quot; is a notification of an existing lease when dnsmasq starts or a change to MAC address or hostname of an existing lease (also, lease length or expiry and client-id, if leasefile-ro is set). If the MAC address is from a network type other than ethernet, it will have the network type prepended, eg &quot;06-01:23:45:67:89:ab&quot; for token ring. The process is run as root (assuming that dnsmasq was originally run as root) even if dnsmasq is configured to change UID to an unprivileged user.</p></blockquote></div><p>As I have several wifi&#039;s spread on my organization, it would be great to signal every time certain MAC acquires an IP on the network in order to &quot;locate&quot; a person that moves across the many buildings around. An option like this would allow a program to keep a track of where the smart phone of this person is and ping it periodically to make it a reliable source of position.</p><p>I move a lot, and with something like this I could make the asterisk pbx to call me to a nearby phone when I move.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi. The dnsmasq daemon still checks for and processes /etc/dnsmasq.conf if it exists, therfore you could create this file with just the single option in it:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dhcp-script=/root/myscript.sh</code></pre></div>									</div>
