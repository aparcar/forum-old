					<p>Hello,<br />I&#039;m trying to see if OpenWrt and Wifidog can do what I need. I have 150 locations around the US. They currently have high end Cisco waps. Their main function is for traveling employeeâ€™s laptops that authenticate with WPA/Radius. These users connect back to our corporate office over frame relay/MPLS. We have begun rolling out guest internet access. This has to go out a local DSL or Cable modem to avoid impacting WAN based business applications. We have rolled out a few with a Monowall VMware appliance running on a local machine, but it has not proven to be reliable and is rather cumbersome to setup. After looking around and testing, I am now on the OpenWrt/WRT54GL bandwagon. I&#039;m blown away by the number of features I get for the price compared to the high end Cisco waps we have been buying. As for the guest internet, we&nbsp; want to use the Wifidog captive portal feature, but anything would work that has the ability for the user to need nothing more than a code to get past the authentication browser.<br />Now for the fun part. I&#039;m so impressed with this setup, I want to consider doing away with the high end Cisco waps all together. Iâ€™ve played around with the Wifidog&nbsp; config, and Iâ€™m not sure if there is a way to have it â€˜ignoreâ€™ one SSID, so I thought Iâ€™d see if there was a way to accomplish this within OpenWrt.&nbsp; With the Cisco wap, I have 2 SSIDs. blah and blah-guest.&nbsp; blah is our non broadcasting corporate SSID and blah-guest is the SSID on a different VLAN that goes to the monowall captive portal. Is it possible to accomplish this with WRT54GL/OpenWrt/Wifidog? Can I have OpenWrt to use Wifidog captive portal on one SSID, and WPA/Radius on another?<br />These sites are remote with no IT staff.&nbsp; If there was any way I could get this setup down to one self-contained box, it would be a huge accomplishment.&nbsp; Any tips or advice on this would be greatly appreciated.<br />Thanks,<br />Matthew Kitchin</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m trying to accomplish basically the same thing. A few minor differences on the &#039;corporate&#039; SSID, but nothing major. Maybe someone out there has an idea.</p>									</div>
