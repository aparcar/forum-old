					<p>Dear All,</p><p>I have a Compex WPJ558 Wi-Fi board. I recently flashed it with OpenWRT and Lede. I got one problem when try to use my PC to connect with the board and use luci to configure that board, I got some problem.</p><p><strong>Problem:</strong> I connect the board with my PC using wire and the PC is set to DHCP. Then, I found that the connection always fails because the PC won&#039;t be assigned an IP address automatically. Since the connection is unsuccessful, I cannot login LUCI.</p><p><strong>Possible Solution I&#039;ve tried.</strong> </p><p>1, I tried to assign my PC with a static IP address: &quot;192.168.1.10&quot;. The connection seems to be good but still cannot login LUCI. I cannot ping my router on my PC either. So I believe the connection is not correctly built.</p><p>2, To make sure that the hardware is good. I flash the board with the firmware from Compex company called &quot;CompexWRT&quot; which is a modified version of OpenWRT. It works with static IP &quot;192.168.1.10&quot;. I can login LUCI. Everthing is fine.</p><p>3, Since &quot;CompexWRT&quot; works, I also copy its configuration file in &quot;/etc/config/network&quot; to the OpenWRT system. However, even with the same configuration, it still fails to work.</p><p>BTW, I got two WPJ558 board, they have exactly the same problem.</p><p>Any suggestions or any explanation to this? And advice are greatly appreciated.</p><p>Alex</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>AlexXie</strong> on 29 May 2017, 09:44)</p>

					<p>First of all, it has nothing to do with luci. I just cannot connect my PC with the board.The connection won&#039;t be build.</p><p>Second, I installed LUCI.

					<p>For sure.</p><p>I already found the problem. It is about the PoE. The board has a LAN and WAN port. But the LAN port and PoE is the same port. So, I need to connect my PC over PoE port and at the same time provide power through that port. I use a PoE injector to achieve that.</p>									</div>
