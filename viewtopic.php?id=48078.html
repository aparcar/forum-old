					<p>I&#039;m using OpenWRT OpenWrt Backfire 10.03.1 on a WRT54GL.</p><p>I&#039;ve noticed that after I define a Static Lease for some device, it doesn&#039;t always seem to take effect - ever.<br />I have one IP Cam that came up at 192.168.1.207.&nbsp; Since I wanted it in a cluster with my other IP cams, I defined a static lease for it at .120.&nbsp; That was 2 weeks ago.&nbsp; The camera has been powered off/on multiple times, but it&#039;s still at 207.</p><p>Why isn&#039;t OpenWRT giving it the .120 address?</p>									</div>

					<p>I would check if the mac address the webcam uses to request the ip on is correct. (doesn&#039;t have to be the sticker sometimes).<br />And the cam could also maybe have a static address set at some point in time.</p>									</div>
