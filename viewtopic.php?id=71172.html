					<p>Hi,</p><p>At home I have an ADSL2+ modem which is connected to an old router running LibreCMC 1.3 (which I think it is just a Barrier Breaker, not sure).</p><p>Everything works fine, but the router&#039;s hardware is very limited and I cannot install some packages I need now. So I am trying to replace that old router.</p><p>The new router is a TP-Link WDR4300. The problem is that, after installing Openwrt and configuring everything -having my old router as a reference-, I get no WAN connectivity.</p><p>Once everything is properly started and plugged into the new router, I run the command &quot;ifconfig -a&quot; and I cannot see the pppoe-wan interface I could see in my old router.</p><p>In the logs of the new router, it complains about the MTU, but I think that setting is ok, that is how the ISP told me to configure it and it works fine in my old router.</p><p>Please find below the logs of the new router. Any suggestion is more than welcome...</p><p>Thank you!!</p><p>Wed May 10 20:20:51 2017 daemon.warn pppd[1574]: Timeout waiting for PADO packets<br />Wed May 10 20:20:51 2017 daemon.err pppd[1574]: Unable to complete PPPoE Discovery<br />Wed May 10 20:20:51 2017 daemon.info pppd[1574]: Exit.<br />Wed May 10 20:20:52 2017 daemon.notice netifd: Interface &#039;wan&#039; is now down<br />Wed May 10 20:20:52 2017 daemon.notice netifd: Interface &#039;wan&#039; is setting up now<br />Wed May 10 20:20:52 2017 daemon.info pppd[1594]: Plugin rp-pppoe.so loaded.<br />Wed May 10 20:20:52 2017 daemon.info pppd[1594]: RP-PPPoE plugin version 3.8p compiled against pppd 2.4.7<br />Wed May 10 20:20:52 2017 daemon.notice pppd[1594]: pppd 2.4.7 started by root, uid 0<br />Wed May 10 20:20:52 2017 daemon.err pppd[1594]: Interface eth0.20 has MTU of 1488 -- should be at least 1500.<br />Wed May 10 20:20:52 2017 daemon.err pppd[1594]: This may cause serious connection problems.<br />Wed May 10 20:21:07 2017 daemon.warn pppd[1594]: Timeout waiting for PADO packets<br />Wed May 10 20:21:07 2017 daemon.err pppd[1594]: Unable to complete PPPoE Discovery<br />Wed May 10 20:21:07 2017 daemon.info pppd[1594]: Exit.<br />Wed May 10 20:21:07 2017 daemon.notice netifd: Interface &#039;wan&#039; is now down<br />Wed May 10 20:21:07 2017 daemon.notice netifd: Interface &#039;wan&#039; is setting up now<br />Wed May 10 20:21:07 2017 daemon.info pppd[1615]: Plugin rp-pppoe.so loaded.<br />Wed May 10 20:21:07 2017 daemon.info pppd[1615]: RP-PPPoE plugin version 3.8p compiled against pppd 2.4.7<br />Wed May 10 20:21:07 2017 daemon.notice pppd[1615]: pppd 2.4.7 started by root, uid 0<br />Wed May 10 20:21:07 2017 daemon.err pppd[1615]: Interface eth0.20 has MTU of 1488 -- should be at least 1500.<br />Wed May 10 20:21:07 2017 daemon.err pppd[1615]: This may cause serious connection problems.</p>									</div>

					<p>Find the WAN interface configuration from the OpenWRT config file /etc/config/network. Add a &#039;pppd_options&#039; line with &#039;debug&#039; value.</p><p>For example:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;wan&#039;

					<p>Also, do you have any more details on how your ISP is providing the Internet access? Do they use VLAN encapsulation i.e. they specify that in VID X you use PPPoE -protocol with &#039;username&#039; and &#039;password&#039; and that this VLAN arrives to you over the ADSL line?</p><p>If this is the case, then you should also post your /etc/config/network details. It may just be a switch or VLAN configuration issue.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Antek</strong> on 9 Jun 2017, 11:23)</p>

					<p>Thank you!!</p><p>I did everything you suggested and I was writing a very long post with all the information I got, but then I saw this new topic in the forum named &#039;No WAN connectivity&#039; which let me see what the problem was. As you suggested it was indeed a switch or VLAN thing. In the switch I was not correctly tagging the WAN port with its VLAN.</p><p>Problem solved!!</p><p>Thanks again!</p>									</div>
