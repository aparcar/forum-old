					<p>I&#039;m just testing the 3 different setups for the IPv6 (stateful-only, stateless+stateful, stateless)<br />Both my, Router Advertisement-Service &amp; DHCPv6-Service are set to &quot;Server-mode&quot;<br />I&#039;m on a &quot;TP-Link Archer C7 v2&quot;, latest dev build.<br />My ISP is successfully giving me a /56 Prefix, and the &quot;lan&quot; has the proper prefix-assignment set for both my ULA and Global Address with a /60 Prefix.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@tplink-router:~# ifstatus lan
&quot;ipv6-prefix-assignment&quot;: [
                {
                        &quot;address&quot;: &quot;2001:569:XXXX:5e00::&quot;,
                        &quot;mask&quot;: 60,
                        &quot;preferred&quot;: 170673,
                        &quot;valid&quot;: 343473
                },
                {
                        &quot;address&quot;: &quot;fd97:e617:7884::&quot;,
                        &quot;mask&quot;: 60
                }
        ],</code></pre></div><p>Firstly, all 3 settings work just fine <em>(stateful,stateless,stateful+stateless)</em> and my (<a href="http://ipv6-test.com/">http://ipv6-test.com/</a>) tests score 20/20 on all.</p><p><strong>STATEFUL</strong><br />To me this seems to be proper. When I set to this, my Linux Clients get 3 addresses. Everything is as expected.<br />&nbsp; - 1 DHCP assigned Global Address (2001::)<br />&nbsp; - 1 DHCP assigned ULA Address (fd00::)<br />&nbsp; - 1 Link-Local Address (fe80::)<br />&nbsp; - (no temporary addresses, as expected)</p><p><strong>STATELESS</strong><br />To me this seems to be proper as well. When I set it to this, my Linux Clients get 3 address (+2 Temporary Address) = 5 Total. Everything is as expected.<br />&nbsp; - 1 SLAAC assigned Global Address (2001::) [with 1 Temporary Address if enabled]<br />&nbsp; - 1 SLAAC assigned ULA Address (fd00::) [with 1 Temporary Address if enabled]<br />&nbsp; - 1 Link-Local Address (fe80::)</p><p><em>QUESTION</em>! So I like this setup, but I dislike that I am getting a Temporary Address for the SLAAC assigned ULA Address. I understand this isn&#039;t OpenWRT&#039;s fault, and will have to be done on the Client Side. I can&#039;t seem to figure out how to turn off Temporary Addresses for certain Prefix&#039;s (like ULA fd00:: Prefixes), since I do not want Temporary Addresses for ULA, only my Global Addresses. I can&#039;t seem to figure out how to do this in Windows or Linux clients, even though I see it is specified in the Specs that it should support turning off Privacy Extensions for certain Prefixes (I.e. ULA).</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4941
Additionally, sites might wish to selectively enable or disable the
   use of temporary addresses for some prefixes.  For example, a site
   might wish to disable temporary address generation for &quot;Unique local&quot;
   [ULA] prefixes while still generating temporary addresses for all
   other global prefixes.  Another site might wish to enable temporary
   address generation only for the prefixes 2001::/16 and 2002::/16,
   while disabling it for all other prefixes.  To support this behavior,
   implementations SHOULD provide a way to enable and disable generation
   of temporary addresses for specific prefix subranges.</code></pre></div><p><strong>STATELESS+STATEFUL</strong><br />So here is where it seems things go wrong. When I set to this, I get the follow addresses on my Linux client:<br />&nbsp; - 1 DHCP assigned ULA Address (fd00::)<br />&nbsp; - 1 SLAAC assigned Global Address (2001::) [with 1 Temporary Address if enabled]<br />&nbsp; - 1 SLAAC assigned ULA Address (fd00::) [with 1 Temporary Address if enabled]<br />&nbsp; - 1 Link-Local Address (fe80::)</p><p>For some reason I am not getting a <em>DHCP assigned Global Addresses</em> in this setup. I can&#039;t seem to figure out why the DHCP Server won&#039;t issue one in this setup (but works in the STATEFUL-only).</p><p><em>QUESTION</em>! Do other people notice this, since this is the &quot;default&quot; OpenWRT setting, are you getting 2 global addresses (SLAAC and a DHCP one - and maybe a TEMP one) with this setup? Is it just this build I am on in OpenWRT, or are others experience this as well?</p><p>Secondly, I dislike that this setup is issuing 2 ULA [Private] Addresses (1 from SLAAC and 1 from DHCP). I understand in the STATELESS only, then the ULA should be assigned from that. And in STATEFUL only, ULA should be assigned from that. But in the Hybrid mode, I would like to select which service supplies the ULA (STATELESS or STATEFUL or BOTH).</p><p><em>QUESTION</em>! Is this possible? Could I setup OpenWRT to only assign the ULA from the DHCP in STATELESS+STATEFUL mode, but still get a Global Address from BOTH (SLAAC &amp; DHCP)?</p><br /><p>My Ideal Setup would be below, is there a way I can achieve this (with a total of <strong>5 IPv6 addresses</strong>):<br />STATELESS+STATEFUL<br />&nbsp; - 1 DHCP assigned Global Address (2001::)<br />&nbsp; - 1 DHCP assigned ULA Address (fd00::)<br />&nbsp; - 1 SLAAC assigned Global Address (2001::)&nbsp; [with 1 Temporary Address if enabled]<br />&nbsp; - 1 Link-Local Address (fe80::)</p><p>Or this Setup would be fine if I can disable Temporary Address on only the ULA one (with a total of <strong>4 IPv6 addresses</strong>):<br />STATELESS<br />&nbsp; - 1 SLAAC assigned Global Address (2001::)&nbsp; [with 1 Temporary Address if enabled]<br />&nbsp; - 1 SLAAC assigned ULA Address (fd00::)&nbsp; &nbsp; [with 0 Temporary Address]<br />&nbsp; - 1 Link-Local Address (fe80::)</p><br /><p><em>QUESTION</em>! I&#039;m not 100% sure why people would want multiple ULA (internal private) addresses. Since the STATELESS+STATEFUL IPv6 setup is the default in OpenWRT, maybe an option to choose who will assigned the ULA address would be good (SLAAC or DHCP or BOTH). Currently it&#039;s set to BOTH and no way to change it which results in multiple ULA Private Addresses (Up to 3 if Temporary Extensions is on).<br />Is this setup even possible? Anyone have the proper network setup if so, which they could share with me? Having so many internal ULA makes the network setup a bit more confusing.</p><p>Since I run a personal web server, a STATELESS+STATEFUL would make setup a littler easier if I have a DHCP assigned ULA/Global addresses. So I would like this setup assuming the 2 problems (No Global DHCP is assigned in this setup - BUG?) and (tell the ULA to only be issued on the DHCP side) is possible.</p><p>Or would this setup be complicated to implement?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>codster</strong> on 15 Aug 2016, 05:42)</p>
