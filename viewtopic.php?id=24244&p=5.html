					<p>Hi Jim, I&#039;m new in this E2100L openwrt world. </p><p>I want to share my experience with those who are new too. Last week I installed your firmware, but after I uninstalled some packages the router was unable to complete the boot sequence&nbsp; ( it was able to response to ping message ),&nbsp; but I was unable to connect to it. I thought I bricked it. After some tinkering ( I added a serial port to it ), I tried un successfull to access the boot console, so&nbsp; I almost gave up, but last night I read about the possibility of openwrt to boot in failsafe mode&nbsp; pressing on the reset button, so I gave it a try. After a few mis tries I did success ( during the boot sequence, just after the power up, press repetitively the reset button, util the indicator led begin to blink rapidly ). After that I was able to telnet to it.</p><p>Now I&#039;m trying to build a customized firmware for my router, but I&#039;m afraid to brick it for real this time. I have experience building custom kernels for my desktop, but I&#039;m afraid to create a firmware that have some component missing. Could you share your config and maybe give me some advice where to put more atention.</p><p>Thanks in advance, best regards</p><br /><p>Carlos F</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Carlos, sorry to hear of you near disaster, happy to hear you got it fixed.&nbsp; You must have deleted one of the required packages since deleting anything I added would not prevent it from working. </p><p>As far as the E2100L goes you can follow this detailed info for WRT160NL found at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt160nl.">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt160nl.</a>&nbsp; Except for editing the two source files previously described the procedure for the E2100L is identical.&nbsp; You will see by the pictures you can&#039;t tell the two apart by looking at the internals.&nbsp; It also has a very good description of how to use the serial console and pinouts.</p><p>When you execute &quot;make menuconfig&quot; all required settings are defaulted.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t deselect anything but I did add quite a bit.&nbsp; My problem is I don&#039;t remember what I added and what was already there.&nbsp; I would have to clean it up and start from scratch to figure that out.&nbsp; I added the Luci package and several modules for the web interface.&nbsp; &nbsp;I also made necessary additions for USB mounting using VFAT NTFS and EXFAT file systems.&nbsp; As requested earlier in this thread I added CIFS functionality.&nbsp; Also added the necessary ushare or minidlna depending on the build.&nbsp; Hint, you need to select necessary libraries/packages before they show up in the Luci section.&nbsp; I did a lot of experimentation adding packages&nbsp; via the Luci interface on a basic build.&nbsp; Then I would add them though the menuconfig and do another compile.&nbsp; That&#039;s where I&#039;m at now.&nbsp; I just do a SVN update, update the feeds and recompile.&nbsp; The only thing I&#039;ve added that&#039;s not posted is a simple text editor, nano in my case.&nbsp; Me and Vi just don&#039;t get along.</p><p>If you want to start from my current configuration&nbsp; I can post it or somewhere e-mail it to you.&nbsp; I do highly recommend you get the serial console to working if you are going to load your own compiled version.&nbsp; &nbsp;The bins I&#039;ve provided have all been tested for at least a couple of hours before I posted them.&nbsp; While booting using the failsafe method does work I&#039;ve found it much easier to just plug in the TTL cable and use that method.&nbsp; I wish someone would sell a cable configured to use the Ethernet port to access the serial console.&nbsp; I tried to make one but I&#039;m just not creative enough I guess.</p><p>Bottom line, if you follow the wiki guidlines, don&#039;t remove any selections already made in the menuconfig program, and compile without errors, you should end up with a bootable bin.&nbsp; I don&#039;t recommend ever using the sysupgrade bin, every time I&#039;ve tried I had to hook up the serial cable to recover.&nbsp; I always uncheck the save settings box when upgrading via Luci and only use the system bin.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jimfree</strong> on 20 Mar 2013, 03:26)</p>

					<p>Hi Jim, thanks for sharing your experience.</p><p>How do you update the firmware if you don&#039;t use sysupgrade, do you use tftp and the serial cable instead or is there another way? How dangerous is to replace the firmware using sysupgrade? I bought a usb-serial cable but none of my notebooks recognized it, only the desktop, which belongs to my sister, did but I was unable to communicate with the router. I think it&#039;s because the cable is based on a cheap knockoff off the PL2303. I hope to find a suitable usb-serial cable and try some customs firmwares, because yours have have stuff I don&#039;t need and I have to install some others (there is no space for pptp, I will try again to remove some stuff).</p><p>Thanks again, I will keep posting my experiences.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve found the PL2303 to be problematic at best.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t been able to use any of 3 different brands reliably on my 64 bit Vista system.&nbsp; Fortunately I still have a laptop lying around with XP that works quite nicely with the cable I have.&nbsp; It really doesn&#039;t do any good to delete anything as it doesn&#039;t free up any space.&nbsp; It actually uses up a few more bytes.</p><p>I should clarify on the sysupgrade statement.&nbsp; When you&nbsp; compile you end up with several bins.&nbsp; Among them is a -sysupgrade.jfs2.bin, -factory.jfs2.bin, -sysupgrade.squashfs.bin and -factory.squashfs.bin.&nbsp; You will see these same bins available in the downloads section for the WRT160NL.&nbsp; Most don&#039;t use the jfs2 as the bin are larger.&nbsp; The sysupgrades are supposed to allow you to upgrade while maintaining your existing settings.&nbsp; My experience has been a brick if I leave the checkbox for keep settings checked, even when using the sysupgrade.bin.&nbsp; That&#039;s why I&#039;ve only posted the factory.bin and mentioned earlier that you need to make sure the keep settings box is not checked when loading the bin.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi again, </p><p>I just returned from buying another usb-serial cable ( I returned the last one ). This time I bought this one <a href="https://www.olimex.com/Products/Components/Cables/USB-Serial-Cable/USB-Serial-Cable-F/">https://www.olimex.com/Products/Compone … l-Cable-F/</a> ( we have a olimex distributor here in chile&nbsp; ). This cable was immediately recognized by my notebook running linux. I suppose the warning statement made by prolific was true about the existence of cheap knockoff.<br />This weekend I will give the serial console another chance and try to flash a custom firmware.</p><p>Thanks for the clarification. What&#039;s the difference between the squash a jsfs version, beside the size? You can flash either of the two?</p>									</div>

					<p>Looks like you are on the path to success Carlos.&nbsp; I compiled a basic build this morning that you could add what you needed.&nbsp; The problem with that is over time the packages become outdated and it won&#039;t let you load them.&nbsp; Just means if you try to reload the bin and then install additional packages a month from now it may or may not work.&nbsp; Seems like a lot of them change daily.</p><p>There&#039;s 2 major difference between the jffs2 and squashfs.&nbsp; The first I already mentioned, you can get more features in smaller filespace with squashfs.&nbsp; The other is squashfs is read-only.&nbsp; The way it is implemented in Openwrit the core system is read only but there are also partitions that are writable.&nbsp; I believe these are jffs2 partitions.&nbsp; I&#039;m not an expert however.&nbsp; I believe openwrt went this route to get the most they could out of the limited memory available, especially in the devices with 2 and 4 meg of ram available.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, good news. Yesterday I flashed my router with a custom firmware, that means the usb-serial cable was the right one. So far so good. The router is up and running. Privoxy, netfilter, usb, all working. It seems there are some LuCI modules missing, but only some minor stuff. Today night goal is to have a pptp tunnel, using HMA servers, and routing some traffic through it.</p><p>As You said Jim, starting from a clean build and selecting the right architecture was a good starting point. It isn&#039;t rocket&nbsp; science, nothing deselected, painless build, added extra stuff and a good amount of patience.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thats great Carlos.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had my current build uptime at nearly a month now.&nbsp; My wifi acts up once in a while, not sure whats causing it.&nbsp; I just issue the wifi command and all is well again.&nbsp; Like you said, its not rocket science.&nbsp; All the hard work has been done by the developers.&nbsp; It would be nice if they included the e2100l.&nbsp; But then I probably would not have started compiling my own.&nbsp; Where&#039;s the fun in that?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jimfree</strong> on 25 Mar 2013, 15:54)</p>

					<p>I think I&#039;ve done my final AA build, this one was based on r36354 which is a little beyond the official release of 36088.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t check the timeline to see what changes were made since the official release.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been running this build for 7 days and it seems pretty stable, no reboots during that time.&nbsp; For those interested in Gargoyle I&#039;ve also posted a Gargoyle build based on AA r36089 for the E2100L.&nbsp; I ran it for about 5 days with no noted issues.&nbsp; All my builds can be found at <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?4o42mc4zafxny.">http://www.mediafire.com/?4o42mc4zafxny.</a>&nbsp; Use at your own risk, all I can vouch for is they all loaded without bricking my E2100L.</p>									</div>

					<p>@Dunedain -- R36354 is Attitude Adjustment which is also known as 12.09.&nbsp; Attitude Adjustment was officially released at R36088 and is the version you would get from their downloads section, if they had one for the E2100L.&nbsp; The Rxxxxx represents the date of the last change submitted to the repository.&nbsp; &nbsp;So any Rxxxxx after R36088 represents a bug fix or enhancement.&nbsp; At some point when the developers are satisfied they may publish another stable version of Attitude Adjustment (12.09).&nbsp; Until then changes beyond the last stable release are considered experimental and may or may not be better.&nbsp; In most cases they are improvements but bugs do sometimes creep in.&nbsp; Considering how many different routers that are supported a fix for one could have ill effects on another.&nbsp; Most of the new development is being done on the next version, Barrier Breaker.&nbsp; The last revision for Attitude Adjustment was R37729 which was done a few days ago according to the timeline.&nbsp; I did an update and compiled last night, as soon as I can load and test it I&#039;ll publish it if I don&#039;t see any immediate problems.</p>									</div>
