					<p>Hello. Struggling Computer Information Systems Student here. I&#039;m still new to configuring routers and using OpenWrt. I setup my HooToo tm02 router with the firmware but now I can&#039;t access my attatched USB drive over the wireless network. I want to have it setup like a NAS so that i can access the drive from any device on the router&#039;s network but there doesn&#039;t seem to be any option for sharing it. If anyone has a remedy I&#039;d appreciate it.</p>									</div>

The TM02 HooToo factory image I uploaded had not quite been &quot;reset to default&quot; as I thought.&nbsp; As a result it still has a password for the &quot;admin&quot; user, it is &quot;imm106&quot;.&nbsp; The &quot;root&quot; password is still &quot;20080826&quot; (default HooToo).&nbsp; An alternative is to load the firmware then do a pin reset after the router reboots.&nbsp; Hold the button for at least 10 seconds, let it reboot and it will restore the &quot;admin&quot; password to none.</p><p>2. I can load HooToo(mtd4-mtd8) and OpenWRT(mtd3) firmware with the original u-boot but can&#039;t load HooToo firmware with the OpenWRT u-boot.&nbsp; It could be my images or something else but it just doesn&#039;t work for me.&nbsp; I too get the LZMA ERROR and it goes into a boot loop.</p><p>3. Doing full FLASH updates with the &quot;all&quot;.bin images from HooToo or OpenWRT works quite well though I only found this option with the HooToo u-boot menu. So to go from OpenWRT back to HooToo via console the factory bootloader had to be loaded first. This was very handy to test both of the backups I uploaded and to go back and forth between HooToo and OpenWRT.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mmmdonuts</strong> on 17 Oct 2015, 23:12)</p>

					<p>Hi mmmDonuts, had stuff to do yesterday so had no play time. Those logins and passwords both worked, but there&nbsp; is definitely something amiss with the &quot;firmware.bin&quot; file when writing it to Flash memory.</p><p>What&#039;s involved for a full FLASH? I am about ready to give up with this as I can reload OpenWrt fine. So might just leave ell enough alone, since it is only a play-thing for me as I have other routers for the real stuff.</p><p>But, if a full flash is not too risky and not too confusing, I may give it a try.</p><p>Thanks for the help to get them both working , albeit with OpenWrt, not a big fan, but they are working routers - now. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi all... very new to this forum and my Tripmate Nano (TM02).. wonder if all you knowledgeable people can help me out in some way.</p><p>My main purpose to use this as a simple media sharing device/NAS for my home network.</p><p>I am having issues trying to set this up with my home network. My home network is a very simple setup wherein I have got a standard ADSL broadband router (from my broadband provider Sky) and all existing devices (laptops, tablets, phones, smart TV, etc) connect to this one router via ethernet cables or using wifi. This all has been working fine without an issues.</p><p>Now with the Tripmate Nano, I want to connect this via a ethernet cable to my same existing router such that it can simply be part of my existing network. The idea is to use the Tripmate Nano&#039;s media sharing/NAS/DLNA capabilities for the devices on my existing network. I don&#039;t intend to use tripmate&#039;s own wifi when I am at home.</p><p>The problem I am having is that although the tripmate is easily getting the internet connection from my router (via ethernet), the existing devices on my network are not able to see the dlna/samba services provied by tripmate. I have tried and they are not even able to ping the tripmate from my existing network (it is clearly visible in the network as TM02 but doesn&#039;t seem to be broadcasting any services). The DLNA/Samba services work fine when directly connected to the tripmate&#039;s own wifi network but doesn&#039;t seem to work for devices connected to my existing network (all on the same network).</p><p>I have tried configuring the Tripmate in a number of different ways but not able to get around this issue. I have seen a couple of videos on youtube where a person was easily able to access the tripmate device and all its services (think that was TM-03 though) via devices on his own network as well as the ones on tripmate&#039;s network. So, I know its definitely doable.</p><p>I know this is a OpenWRT forum but I would still like to know if the Tripmate can do what I want out of the box without putting OpenWrt on it (which would be my preffered option). Else if not possible, will this OpenWrt solve this for me.</p><p>I would appreciate your help and support to help me resolve this issue. Any config suggestions welcome. Thanks in advance.</p><p>Cheers.</p>									</div>

					<p>Savvy, out of the box the TM02 will do exactly what you want as I had it set up and doing all of that and more. That&#039;s why I wanted to return it to stock after putting OpenWrt (OW) on it. I figured OW would just be a better option and all would work like the factory, but not so.</p><p>Using OW is really a mess trying to get the USB-drive to work on the TM02. Some have claimed to do it, I was never able to. </p><p>Given that is so difficult (I have given up) to revert OW back to factory, I would be spending time on networking newsgroups to sort out the connection issues with the stock firmware. It will do all you need, but way too much stuff for outlining here.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>HooTooBeatMe</strong> on 18 Oct 2015, 18:23)</p>

					<p>@HootooBeatMe</p><p>Many thanks for your reply - it gives me some motivation to know I am not playing in the dark!</p><p>I have come to the conclusion that it is something to do with the nature of the WAN port on the Tripmate. It is properly able to connect to my existing network and fetch internet etc without any issues but for some reason, its not able to share its DLNA/Samba services to the same network. One small thing and its doing my head in now!</p><p>I have spent numerous hours already and not able to setup Tripmate in a way my existing network devices can see its services. I understand it might be too much info for here but if you can give me some pointers, it would be highly appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>@savvysps,<br />Technically the ethernet port on the Tripmate is a WAN port though earlier versions of their firmware were not blocking services and allowing access. This was a bug still in place on .018.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what version you are on or exactly in which version HooToo fixed the problem.&nbsp; If you are on a later version you can try to downgrade your router but keep in mind that if you ever plan to use it as a travel router your services would be exposed to the internet.&nbsp; If I recall this exposure was there on both the wired and wireless interface on the WAN side and included HTTP(80), telnet (23), SMB and DLNA.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mmmdonuts</strong> on 19 Oct 2015, 01:31)</p>

					<p>@mmmdonuts,</p><p>Thanks.. very useful info indeed and probably explains my issues!</p><p>The first thing I did when I got the Tripmate Nano was to upgrade the firmware. Think it was on .018 and I upgraded to .26 and according to what you said it seems this is what is the cause of my problems... awwww</p><p>Quick question - Do you know where can I find the .018 factory tripmate&nbsp; firmware? Quick search around and Hootoo&#039;s website only seem to have the latest firmware (.26) available.</p><p>I will happily downgrade the firmware for now and get it going if I can...</p>									</div>

					<p>Here&#039;s an update for all then....</p><p>The .018 firmware works perfectly fine straight out of the box with next to no config changes whatsoever. So whatever I was trying to do from past couple of days and many config changes were of no real use as Hootoo seems to have blocked the WAN port for outgoing services in the .26 firmware at least. I hope this will help someone else like me in the future! :-)</p><p>I&#039;ll try out the .018 thoroughly over next few and let you know how it goes but for now... it seems to be doing the trick nicely.</p><p>Thanks a lot to all of you... great people... great forum.. keep up the good work.</p><p>@Hootoo Junkie... I agree that no point going any further backwards.. Are there any other firmware releases between .18 and the .26 currently available? If yes and you have them, it will be useful to have them share please... Thanks again for your help mate.</p>									</div>

					<p>@HootooJunkie</p><p>I also sent an email to Hootoo over the weekend an got this reply from them this morning:</p><p>-------------------------------------------<br />Thank you for contacting us.<br />May I understand that you would like to use the DLNA/Samba service if your pcs are in the same netowrk of the TripMate? Please understand that we have banned the WAN access to the TripMate after firmware 2.000.022, because some customers said there was a risk of privacy security. So if you need this feature, please downgrade the firmware to 2.000.022<br />-------------------------------------------</p><p>So it is exactly on the same lines as we thought. For everyone&#039;s info, firmware .022 is the last stable one to use which allows access to WAN port openly. I have got this from Hootoo now and will be flashing this one for my use.</p><p>Thanks again for everyone&#039;s help here... Lets hope my Hootoo keeps going strong...</p><p>Btw any suggestions for the best Android and IOS apps to use with Hootoo will be welcome. I have got the Hootoo one but guess its not as good as it could be.</p>									</div>
