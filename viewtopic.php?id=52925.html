					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>I&#039;ve been using openwrt for one of my projects.</p><p>I am still confused about how things work in openwrt. I know there is the buildroot and in buildroot there are feeds...</p><p>Recently I am trying to locate gdb in order to debug program on the MIPS platform.</p><p>I did ./script/feeds list | grep gdb and found nothing. </p><p>So I used make menuconfig and found gdb and gdb server under &quot;developers&quot;.</p><p>If I go on to <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/packages">https://github.com/openwrt/packages</a> and under devel, I found nothing...</p><p>It is so confusing. Shouldn&#039;t everything be included in various feeds?</p><p>Also, I found the entire feed thing confusing. </p><p>There are the staging_dir and build_dir....these are very confusing to me as well. What are they used for?</p><p>Any information will be high apprecicated!</p><p>Best,</p><p>-pilypala</p>									</div>

					<p>AFAICT, a <em>scripts/feeds list &lt;package&gt;</em> will ONLY be able to list any available package under any feeds listed in both feeds.conf and feeds.conf.default files. Since gdb isn&#039;t part of any feeds package, except the buildroot package (under package/devel/gdb), a <em>scripts/feeds list gdb</em> will return nothing.</p><p>BTW, I would prefer to use a <em>scripts/feeds search gdb</em> over a <em>scripts/feeds list gdb</em>. The former will give a succinct list to show which package belongs to which feed.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[debian@Debian:/opt/openwrt-git-trunk 189%] ~ scripts/feeds search gdb

					<p>Thanks for the reply! It&#039;s nice to know the search command.</p><p>However, still I am confused about how the entire build process works and what various directories are for.</p><p>Like for example, what&#039;s the difference between selecting a package in menuconfig and installing package later on with opkg command? </p><p>And sometimes you can&#039;t install using opkg tool&nbsp; (missing package) while you can select the package&nbsp; in menuconfig or using feed tools. </p><p>What if I just want to build a single package in buildroot and transfer the binaries and library over using scp?</p><p>Anyone can venture some information on this will be highly appreciated...</p>									</div>
