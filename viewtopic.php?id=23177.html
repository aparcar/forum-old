					<p>Hi all!</p><p>I am looking for an embedded board to be closed in an outdoor sealed case.<br />The requirement are:</p><p>Packets per second processed<br />2 to 4 mini-pci in order to use wifi-cards<br />2 ethernet<br />POE<br />possibility to have a sealed case.<br />well supported by OpenWRT</p><p>Basically I need a board with 2 mini-pci, a board with 3 mini-pci, a board with 4 mini-pci.</p><p>If the board with 4 mini-pci is not expensive I would use always that.</p><p>In my little research I have found gateworks and alix.<br />These are the best solution or there is something more powerful? The alix is more powerful than avila/cambria board?</p><p>Thanks a lot for the answer.</p>									</div>
