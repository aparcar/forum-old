					<p>Hey everyone,</p><p>I&#039;ve been struggling for a few days now to get a working config for a project i&#039;m working on.&nbsp; Here&#039;s what I have:</p><p>Buffalo WZR-HP-AG300H<br />OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment 12.09 / LuCI 0.11.1 Release (0.11.1)<br />Kernel 3.3.8<br />Raspberry Pi with ONE dot1q capable, wired interface.&nbsp; (snort is installed on this)</p><p>The buffalo is a dual radio unit.&nbsp; wl0 is 802.11g (2.4) and wl1 is 802.11n (5.0).&nbsp; I have created vlans and ssids that isolate each radio from the other - you cannot speak to devices across them, they are not bridged.&nbsp; It is wan access only.&nbsp; LAN devices can&#039;t talk to any wlan interfaces either.&nbsp; Everything is an island and works great, at least for that part.&nbsp; Enter the raspberry pi.&nbsp; This is generally where things go horribly wrong.&nbsp; The thought was to do vlan tagging on the interface of the raspberry pi and tag the port on the buffalo that connected to the rasp pi.&nbsp; Only the default vlan seems to work though.&nbsp; tcpdump shows that the raspberry pi doesn&#039;t answer an arp, but I don&#039;t know it&#039;s actually hearing the arp.&nbsp; I was listening on the vlan interface that I had my pc connected to, which is the same vlan/subnet that the raspberry pi was on.&nbsp; I believe that it wasn&#039;t getting the arp request because of the way everything is &quot;disconnected/firewalled/not-bridged&quot; etc, from the rest.&nbsp; The problem is that I can&#039;t seem to find a way to make them talk without all of the DHCP servers that are running (one for the LAN, wl0 and wl1).&nbsp; Bridging is bad, because it&#039;s a crap shoot what IP the devices will get, and that&#039;s not good.</p><p>Basically, i&#039;m wondering if it&#039;s possible on this hardware to do this and if so, what a config might look like?&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried just about every example google and these forums has offerred up, but nothing has worked thus far.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure it&#039;s a configuration issue.&nbsp; Here&#039;s what I have now though, the most basic soho wifi router setup you can get.&nbsp; This is the iteration where everything can talk to everything.&nbsp; </p><p>config interface &#039;loopback&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;lo&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp;
