					<p>Hi all, I want to use netmeeting like clients in order to setup videoconference with my openmcu server. Server is placed on 1gb dedicated lan and works well, but client is under openwrt router, connected via adsl to the internet. The problem is: if I connect to server I see few first frames from MCU and then I recieve connection drop, not only with gatekeeper or MCU but as well with internet. Router starts to reconnect to adsl and drop again and again and again..<br />I&#039;ve googled a bit and found out that h323 opens a great number of random ports and most modems die because of this, but this problem can be fixed by means of ALG. Is it implemented in openwrt? If it is how should I activate or setup it.<br />Thanks!</p>									</div>
