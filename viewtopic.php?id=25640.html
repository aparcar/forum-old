					<p>Hi,</p><p>im looking for a solution to my home network, having 5-6 user and been looking at the OpenWrt and other ways of solving the situation.</p><p>What i would like to do is the following:<br />- Split the network into 4 Vlan, one wireless, one for users, and one for me, and one for the internet.<br />- Would like to have one DHCP scope per VLAN and the possibility to exclude some vlans from others, and so on.<br />- Need a Firewall functionality, preferably with IDS.<br />- Got to use the 802.1q standard for Vlan, since i have a managed switch after.</p><br /><p>The question is, is this possible with OpenWrt?, what packages would i then need? and what equipment would you peoplen reccomend? Got a couple of WRT54GL but they &quot;choke&quot; easily. Would like a powerful box that could easily be installed and put into action.</p><p>Boxes ive been looking at that are too expensive, but have the functionality is:<br />Zywall&nbsp; USG-100<br />Juniper SSG 5</p><br /><p>Should also mention that i have a 30mbit internet connection, so the box have to be able to handle some traffic.</p><br /><br /><p>Thanks for answers.</p>									</div>
