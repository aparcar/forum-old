					<p>I have problem when I connect 3 printers (1st direct to ASUS 2nd and 3rd via USB hub). Sometimes order of ports for each printers is changing. <br />For example I have set port 9100 for 1st and 9101 for 2nd printer, but after night when I turn the printers on when trying to print on 1st printer it prints on 2nd. </p><p>Any ideas?</p><p>It looks to me like I need to set each printer to set the same /dev/usb/lpX each time I turn on printers or reboot router. Is it possible?</p><p>How can I identify which listening port is for which printer? After &quot;netstat -an&quot; I see router is listening on ports 9100, 9101, 9102, but I have no idea which one is which. X-wrt shows even model of printers, but don&#039;t shows on which port p910nd is listening to.</p><p>Is it possible that my problem is because of USB hub connected to one of USB port in ASUS?</p><p>This problem never occurs in the middle of work but only in the morning when I turn on printers. The router is on 24/7.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />afaik p910n uses the /dev/lpx devices to &quot;speak&quot; to the printers.<br />Afaik OpenWRT always assigns the first one (lp0) with the first connected printer so<br />your only way is to start the printers always in the same way. So first printer 1, wait 10 sec, then the next one.<br />Or you could try using cups using the DeviceURI option (well, this will only work if your printers arent the same type)<br />which will always assign the same printer to the same queue.</p><p>with best regards<br />p90</p><p>PS: Please excuse my bad english</p>									</div>
