					<p>Hi Devs ... i know maybe this is not the best place to ask about this, but i&#039;m having problems logging/trying to recover my password from dev.openwrt.org. Is everything OK there ?</p><p>My username/password are saved on my browser, i&#039;m pretty sure i havent changed them. But login is refused: &quot;Invalid username or password&quot;.</p><p>When i try to recover my password, even having sure that i&#039;m entering my correct username and registered email, i receive: &quot;The email and username must match a known account&quot;.</p><p>I&#039;m pretty sure my username is correct because i can check it on a ticket i opened and it&#039;s still opened: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/16651">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/16651</a> - username leonardogyn</p><p>I&#039;m also pretty sure that my email is correct because i can confirm, on the account used, the notifications received on the above ticket.</p><p>Can anyone here, on the devs forum, help me with this ? Thanks !</p>									</div>
