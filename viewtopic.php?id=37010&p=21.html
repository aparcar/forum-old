					<p>Hello Bruno. Congrats for this amazing project. The only thing missing are the components to provide voltage to the usb port. Which capacitors and voltage regulator did you use? (the one wtih heatsink). Thanks in advance.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>brunomenezesmg wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Ok. Here are my little project:</p><p>I&#039;m using my 841n v8 as a Printer Server / Scanner Server / Torrent Client.<br />The Printer Server is handled by P910ND, the Scanner Server by SANE and the Torrent by Transmission. The Printer/Scanner is a EPSON TX300F.<br />On the Client side (me and my house, we&#039;re all running Windows 10).</p><p>* The Printer Server isn&#039;t reliable yet because sometimes when a print job is sent to the printer it can take ages to start printing or start printing right away.</p><p>* The Scanner Server is working like a hell! JUST PERFECT! Can&#039;t even describe how flawless it is! Never had a issue since installing/configuring SANE.</p><p>* The Torrent side of my project is a little weird right now, I&#039;m not reaching the full speed of my connection (5mbits ~ 575kb/s). Maybe my pendrive is very slow or even the router&#039;s RAM is filling up and throttling the download speeds. Sometimes using the Transmission web interface gives me errors about data loss between my browser and transmission web interface. If anyone has tips on this I&#039;ll be grateful.</p><p>I have to say, to solder those wires to that small pins... Jesus... I have shaky hands, you guys can&#039;t even know how difficult it was to me.</p><p>To starters like me, I don&#039;t know how to patch a kernel and enable the Atheros to listen and send data through D- and D+ so I used uboot&#039;s firmware posted on this forum. Worked well, but it was compiled using trunk and trunks change a lot, so I was not able to use other packages than those provided on the zip file. For now I&#039;m using a pre-enabled D+ and D- firmware (from the 3420v2), the problem here is the space left to the user to install storage support. So I had to compile a Chaos Calmer stable image without LUCI and with some packages already built in to save space. Worked like a charm. for anyone who needs this firmware you can&nbsp; <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/download/eeeygpn5jsad5os/openwrt-15.05-ar71xx-generic-tl-mr3420-v2-squashfs-factory.bin">DOWNLOAD IT HERE</a>.</p><p>The second step was install an USB hub WITH external power supply. At first I was not aware about the lack of power this router Power Supply is capable of provide. Even building a relative good circuit to provide power, I didn&#039;t noticed that the Power Supply is only 500 mAh! So this caused a lot of problems and it was the last thing I&#039;ve checked hahaha. I&#039;m planning to build or buy another one with greater capabilities (at least 2000 mAh).</p><p>The third step was to enable my pendrive as extroot. Went in some problems here because my swap partition was mounting twice. Had to disable for now. Using normal ram until I find out the problem here.</p><p>The fourth step was about installing all packages I need. Now I have plenty space. My /overlay partition of extroot is 512mb.</p><p>The fifth step was configure and enable the Printer, Scanner and Transmission.</p><br /><p>Here are my pictures hacking the device (too ZOOM IN just open the image on a new tab):</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/FeIZTjm.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/FeIZTjm.jpg" /></span></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/uvtpTSC.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/uvtpTSC.jpg" /></span></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/GzWBeBB.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/GzWBeBB.jpg" /></span></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2iFmI6o.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/2iFmI6o.jpg" /></span></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ixyYxEg.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/ixyYxEg.jpg" /></span></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/QOdYjo1.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/QOdYjo1.jpg" /></span></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/bBQ2FDs.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/bBQ2FDs.jpg" /></span></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/GmjIGxU.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/GmjIGxU.jpg" /></span></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/lOBZmha.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/lOBZmha.jpg" /></span></p><br /><p>Improving the design.

					<p>Hi @ all,<br />many times asked Topic for this Device is OpenVPN.<br />I know the Ram is to smal 4mb for OpenVPN i Need 8mb this i understand.<br />My question is a Little bit different because this Router i use with Cable via Lan Port1, so the Question is if the files wich are for the DSL not anymore needed and not anymore included in the Firmware is then enough space for Openvpn?</p><p>BR</p><p>Trek</p>									</div>

					<p>In the LEDE forum &quot;community builds&quot; there is a thread where people have made and published VPN builds for 4MB TP-Link routers.&nbsp; And yes one of the first things they take out is ppp / pppoe which is used only for DSL and fiber services.</p><p>It&#039;s also really easy to upgrade to a 16 MB flash chip though the 32MB of RAM will still limit you.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 11 Mar 2018, 18:52)</p>
