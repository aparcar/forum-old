					<p>Hi there!</p><p>I have been trying to install openwrt on my asus wl-500gp for 3 and a half hours and on different internet pages (e.g. <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=14186)">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=14186)</a> i came accross the type-&quot;ipkg update&quot;-thingy.<br />My big problem is that my Router doesn&#039;t have any connection to the internet, how should he? there has to be some way to tell him the ip of the nic of my modem, the username and password and the protocol to be pptp.</p><p>didn&#039;t get satisfied with the search-feature!</p><br /><br /><p>(dd-wrt still lacks in pptp implementation and the web interface was slow as hell, so this is not an opportunity ;-] )</p>									</div>

Reconnect takes ~15mins with several attempts! This weekend I will replace the speedtouch home (already patched to pro version) with a speedtouch 510i (=ISDN Version), it should be able to connect (and reconnect after 8h disconnects) itself.<br />Drawback: you have double NAT and dyndns is a little bit more difficult.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MMCM</strong> on 14 Feb 2008, 17:08)</p>

					<p>Ah, I see.&nbsp; So you are currently using PPTP on your wl-500gp, but not with OpenWrt?</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>mr.ioes wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>configuration panel of the webinterface</p></blockquote></div><p>I assume you mean the web interface on the wl-500gp.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>mr.ioes wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>or... can i install x-wrt and all that stuff locally?</p></blockquote></div><p>Again I am not sure what you mean by this <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />&nbsp; You can download the packages to your PC before flashing and then install them on the router after flashing without needing Internet access from the router.</p><p>If you compile Kamikaze yourself, you can include X-Wrt and the stuff needed for PPTP into the image, so that when you flash it, all the necessary software is already installed.</p><p>If you install one of the X-Wrt images, you should have X-Wrt when you flash the router, but I don&#039;t know if the packages required for PPTP are included.&nbsp; If they are, then maybe that&#039;s the way to go.&nbsp; If they are not, you would have to download the packages before flashing.&nbsp; Then after you have flashed the router, you would have to upload the packages to the router from your PC and install them.</p><p>Note: I have never used PPTP (in OpenWrt or anywhere else) so I don&#039;t know how well/badly it works.&nbsp; I find it strange that it would take 15 minutes to connect, as MMCM says, though.</p><p>MMCM: Do you have any idea why you have so much trouble connecting?</p>									</div>
