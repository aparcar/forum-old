					<p>I mistakenly posted this to the White Russian forum, so I&#039;m posting it again here.&nbsp; I am working on porting Kamikaze to the Routerboard 100 series of boards by Microtik.&nbsp; Using a patch from Microtik for the 2.4.31 kernel, I can get the system up and booting.&nbsp; However there are still several issues I need to resolve:</p><p>1) Some of my packages are not getting adding to my filesystem tarball. Specifically ebtables is getting built and generating an ipkg, but the modules don&#039;t show in my build_mipsel/root directory.</p><p>2) I don&#039;t have any device nodes in /dev&nbsp; I have created those by hand in order to get the system to boot.&nbsp; Am I supposed to be using devfs to create them or is there a script that does it or do I need to write my own script?&nbsp; I don&#039;t see anything in the startup scripts that would startup devfsd.</p><p>3) I don&#039;t get a serial console.&nbsp; rcS seems to hang after all the startup scripts finish and the output gets passed to logger.&nbsp; If I comment out the logger and start /bin/ash from rcS, I get a console.&nbsp; If I don&#039;t run ash from rcS, it just hangs and never returns to inittab.</p>									</div>

					<p>At this point, I&#039;ve resolved most of the issues that I mentioned above.&nbsp; The RB532 port is a good suggestion, however I have to run in 2.4 to support a proprietary driver that I need.&nbsp; Plus I have most of the RB1xx hardware working.</p><p>The ebtables problem was due to me selecting kmod-ebtables with &#039;M&#039; instead of &#039;Y&#039; so it built the package but didn&#039;t install it.&nbsp; A littlle confusing, I figured that building kmod-ebtables with M meant I wanted to compile ebtables as a module vs. compiling it into the kernel.</p><p>I also fixed the dev node issues.&nbsp; Turns out Microtik doesn&#039;t use devfs for RouterOS so it was turned off by default.&nbsp; In addition they backported the 2.6 MTD code which uses the 2.6 API.&nbsp; I hacked that out of the patch, changed my config, and devfs works.</p><p>Still having problems with the serial console, however it&#039;s not a big deal as I can just modify the startup scripts to workaround the issue.</p><p>The one thing I am noticing is that I get a lot of zombie processes.&nbsp; If I start cron and then shut it down, I get a cron zombie process.&nbsp; Doing this over and over again produces more zombie processes.&nbsp; Has anyone seen this issue before?&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s related to init not completely finishing or something else.</p><p>I am also having a problem getting lighttpd talking to php5.&nbsp; When it starts up, it dies with the error:<br />2000-01-01 01:13:25: (mod_fastcgi.c.890) failed: Address family not supported by protocol<br />I&#039;m not sure if this is because I somehow disabled support for unix sockets or broken patchiness behavior.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am currently playing with kamikaze (from svn) on a RB112 with the latest (2.7) firmware.</p><p>Thanks to your work I was able to compile a working kernel for this board with almost no effort; if I build openwrt with the root filesystem on initramfs I can netboot from the image and all is well (apart from having almost no free ram, but that&#039;s hardly a surprise).</p><p>Now I&#039;d like to try booting from the onboard flash, so I skimmed through the Mikrotik docs and took a look at the cf2nand script in the rb532 target: it looks like all I need to do is to mount the first NAND partition (/dev/mtdblock0) as a yaffs filesystem and copy the kernel (that is, the &#039;vmlinux.elf&#039; loader+image combo) to it as a file named &#039;kernel&#039;.</p><p>Evidently I missed something, because the bootloader keeps saying &quot;kernel not found&quot;...</p><p>I can netboot the board again, mount the same partition and verify that the file is there with the proper contents.</p><p>What am I doing wrong?</p><p>thanks,<br />Andrea</p>									</div>

					<p>I am the one who has been doing most of the work on the NAND driver, and I am having exactly the same problem.&nbsp; I had tried to upgrade the firmware on mine to see if it was a firmware problem (it is 1.9 at the moment) but it refuses to upgrade to 2.7.&nbsp; So it is good to know that it is not a BIOS problem and that I can stop following that line.</p><p>My next target is the designation on the rb100.html page that only the 153 supports Linux as well as RouterOS.&nbsp; It is I suppose possible that they have put something in there that notices that this is not a RouterOS kernel.&nbsp; But I do not have a 153 to work with.&nbsp; If anyone does have one and could do what is described above and see if you get the same result that would be great.&nbsp; Alternatively if anyone has a 153 they could lend me I can do the experiment.</p><p>It is a great shame that Microtik take such a head in the sand position with regard to getting Linux to work on their boards.&nbsp; If only there were some way to persuade them that if they help (just a bit) they would increase their sales I am sure that life would be easier on all of us.</p><p>David</p>									</div>

					<p>Another useful experiment (which I can not do here as I have already overwritten the NAND on my 112) is to copy the RouterOS kernel off the board onto a PC, erase the first partition, and copy it back again.&nbsp; All of this needs to be done using the netbooted kernel and the NAND and Yaffs support that that has so that we can verify that they are both working properly.&nbsp; If it works then either the kernel has something in it that the loader does not like, or there something about the RouterOS kernel that the BIOS is looking for.</p><p>David</p>									</div>

					<p>I suspect that the problem is in the combination of options for the MTD-NAND layer and YAFFS.&nbsp; Part of the problem is that Microtik only produce patches for 2.4, and the options for MTD have changed since then, and a newer version of Yaffs is also available ( and necessary for the larger NAND chips but as far as I know not reflected in any Microtik patches.&nbsp; </p><p>The patches are derived from the 2.4 patch for the RB532, which contains references to the 100 (and 400 - whatever that might be) series.&nbsp; I have looked at them but can not see the problem (maybe I am too close to the problem).&nbsp; If anyone wants to have a look and can spot anything that would be very useful.&nbsp; The acid test is whether it boots, but a simpler test may be to make sure it mounts cleanly.&nbsp; Note that when you do the mount although it things of the blocks as bad it does not appear to write this to disk as you get exactly the same if you reboot and remount.</p><p>David</p>									</div>

					<p>Did anyone try mounting the rOS boot partition from a 2.4 kernel with the mikrotik patch?

					<p>Well yes it does, but there are several versions of the 532 and depending on the version (I think the difference is the type of NAND chip) we had to go to a later version of the yaffs code than microtik suggest (as I mentioned they have not updated the 532 patch).</p><p>David</p>									</div>
