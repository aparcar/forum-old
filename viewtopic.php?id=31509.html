					<p>Morning,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to make a service (privoxy) restart when a user changes the Dnsmasq settings in LuCI.</p><p>I understand from previous posts and from reading the code that /etc/config/ucitrack is used to determine dependent services and what should be restarted. So I made the following changes:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config dhcp
        option init dnsmasq
        list affects privoxy

config privoxy
        option init privoxy</code></pre></div><p>I also made sure that /etc/init.d/privoxy existed, was executable, and the service was enabled (I see entries for privoxy in /etc/rc.d/). I also have /etc/config/privoxy with some minimal configuration inside.</p><p>This, as I understand it, should be all that is required to have dnsmasq and privoxy restart when a user changes DHCP settings in LuCI.</p><p>However, I see that dnsmasq restarts when pressing &#039;Save &amp; Apply&#039;, but privoxy does not. I&#039;ve added logger statements into the privoxy init script and see that it is not called. I also added logger statements into /sbin/luci-reload and see that it is only called with one argument: &quot;dhcp&quot;. This suggests to me that it is not finding privoxy as a dependent service for some reason.</p><p>Any suggestions? I see there have been posts on this before, and I will write up a Wiki article on this to answer it definitively once this is solved.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Sam</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>samcrawford</strong> on 23 Aug 2011, 14:09)</p>

					<p>Okay, to answer my own thread:</p><p>If you have a CBI page in LuCI with a Map that affects a service (say &quot;dhcp&quot; in my case), then LuCI will *not* restart &#039;affected&#039; services listed in /etc/config/ucitrack. It will only restart the service listed in the first argument to Map(...)</p><p>This is managed by an Ajax callback to /cgi-bin/luci/;stok=XXXXXX/servicectl/restart/&lt;service&gt;, which in turn invokes action_restart() in /usr/lib/lua/luci/controller/admin/servicectl.lua. Neither action_restart() nor the function that generate the HTML printing the Ajax callback make a lookup to the affected services list.</p><p>This seems odd to me, as a lot of the required functionality for looking up affected services is in _affected() in /usr/lib/lua/luci/model/uci.lua.</p><p>Quick solution: If you want to restart an affected service then you can create a dummy Map relating to the appropriate service in your CBI, and then return that along with the primary one. This will then force LuCI to generate the Ajax callback with a link pointing at /cgi-bin/luci/;stok=XXXXXX/servicectl/restart/dhcp,privoxy.</p><p>For example:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>m = Map(&quot;dhcp&quot;,&quot;DHCP&quot;)
-- Lots of sections etc relating to &quot;m&quot; here
m2 = Map(&quot;privoxy&quot;, &quot;&quot;)
return m, m2</code></pre></div><p>Note to LuCI developers if they&#039;re reading: I&#039;d be happy to work up a patch to LuCI to support reading the &#039;affects&#039; config from /etc/config/ucitrack. Of course, if I&#039;m missing something please do say.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Sam</p>									</div>

					<p>No problem. I&#039;d be interested in hearing from the community &amp; LuCI developers if this is considered a bug, or if I&#039;m simply doing something wrong. I post it to the LuCI list this evening if I don&#039;t hear anything back.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Sam</p>									</div>
