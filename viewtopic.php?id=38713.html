					<p>Hello:<br />I am an internee working on Openwrt4GL kernel modification.<br />Firstly, i installed WRT54G-squashfs.bin (10.03.01) on WRT54GL V1.1, everything was perfect.<br />Then i modify it with Openwrt-brcm-2.4 squashfs.trx (WhiteRussian 0.9); now i am unable to access throughGUI (SSh is working though). How to bring it back?</p><p>Now , i come to important point, i have to work on linux source code of version 2.6.39 or later, in order to customize it and implement it on wrt54GL V1.1 to see results. which OpenWrt version do u recommend? I see the source code of whiterussian 0.9 kernel 2.4 too old to customize. Should i download trunk version and make openwrt-brcm47xx-squash.trx file after customizing the source code of linux-3.38 (linux-brcm47xx)? Will WRT54GL support it?</p><p>Lastly, i would like to ask how can i recompile the source code of linux ? Is this like that make clean in trunk and then make V=99, then copy openwrt-brcm47xx-squash.trx to the Openwrt54GL through TFTP to see the results.</p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>
