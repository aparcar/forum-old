					<p>Hi,</p><p>I setup my samba a long time ago, and have been using it with my Windows 10 and my Android phone without any problem. I moved my router to another room, then I found I cannot access the samba service neither from my Windows 10, nor my Android phone.</p><p>I have tried reboot. I have checked the configuration, and firewall settings. Nothing helps!!!</p><p>Windows auto diagnose said cannot connect to the remove server.</p><p>I cannot think of another place that I can check. Please help.</p>									</div>
