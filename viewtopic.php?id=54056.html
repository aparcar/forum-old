					<p>I constantly see DD-WRT as the recommended 3rd party firmware out there, with a handful of people gravitating toward Tomato due to the clean/simple UI. I think everyone here probably agrees that OpenWrt is the best choice, but it can definitely be intimidating to someone new this sort of stuff and definitely challenging for someone not familiar with networking and routers in general. I think a few simple changes could make OpenWrt much more friendly to this group of people.</p><p><strong>1. A Luci-based guided setup on first run. It would:</strong><br /></p><ul><li><p>set a router admin password</p></li><li><p>choose between router, AP, WDS, and repeater modes</p></li><li><p>configure the WAN connection</p></li><li><p>configure WiFi with default security set to WPA2-PSK (maybe not even expose security mode to the user)</p></li><li><p>configure an isolated guest WiFi network</p></li><li><p>possibly point to the simplified package manager (see below) at the end</p></li></ul><p><strong>2. A basic and advanced mode in Luci</strong><br /></p><ul><li><p>Basic mode shows only basics and hides settings that can break things or that aren&#039;t used all that often.</p></li><li><p>Basic should also have some help in a side bar or via link (to wiki?)</p></li><li><p>Simplified status page that just shows connection status, connected clients, and possibly warnings</p></li><li><p>Simplifed log that just shows the most critical info</p></li><li><p>Advanced mode is what we have today, but could use some more help text.</p></li></ul><p><strong>3. A simplified package manager</strong><br /></p><ul><li><p>rather than the vast list of packages we have available, show the most commonly used ones that have Luci-apps available (QoS, UPNP, vnstat, file sharing).</p></li><li><p>Display friendly names (e.g. Windows file sharing instead of Samba)</p></li><li><p>Use a simple on/off button to install/enable/start the package (similar to FreeNAS plugins).</p></li><li><p>Even better would be a guided setup after installation.</p></li><li><p>Advanced mode turns on the full package manager we have today</p></li></ul><p>A nice example of this in a commercial router is TP-Link&#039;s new interface used in the Archer C8/C9. If that&#039;s open source for whatever reason, it would be great to just take it (doubtful). There&#039;s a simulated UI available on the web here: </p><p><a href="http://www.tp-link.com/resources/simulator/Archer-C8/Index.htm">http://www.tp-link.com/resources/simula â€¦ /Index.htm</a></p><p>Note that in the simulation, if you try to do anything that actually tries to connect to the internet, the simulation breaks down. </p><br /><p>Somewhat unrelated is #4: To keep newbies out of trouble, include Luci in trunk builds! There are tons of support requests on the forums for help with this problem. I wonder how many more just think their router is bricked. Many wiki pages link to trunk because that was the only choice at the time the wiki was written, and this of course gets the newbie that doesn&#039;t know better into trouble.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drawz</strong> on 17 Nov 2014, 02:36)</p>

So many people intentionally or unintentionally flash a trunk build without realizing the implication. In many cases, this is due to an outdated wiki or because stable versions do not support their device. More frequent stable releases would certainly help with that latter part, and the devs seem to be headed in that direction. Imagebuilder is not a great option for those newbies that would struggle with this. I&#039;d argue that anyone that can use imagebuilder can probably also figure out how to install luci from the command line.</p>									</div>

					<p>I wish I had the skills to code this myself. I really think OpenWrt could easily become the de facto open source router firmware if it were just a little more user friendly. It is clearly the most stable, most flexible, most modern, and most technically advanced right now. </p><p>One other suggestion for the basic luci UI - make it hard to do things that will kill access to the router - such as modifying or deleting LAN/WAN interfaces or giving too much flexibility to the DHCP server that might cause it to break. Just in general, removing controls that are not needed for day to day use by most users - if it&#039;s not in most stock firmwares, it probably isn&#039;t needed in basic mode.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drawz</strong> on 18 Nov 2014, 18:47)</p>

					<p>Saw the Eero router/AP/repeater/mesh network device announced yesterday and it sounds like it is possibly OpenWrt-based. If so, this is a great example of simplifying OpenWrt for the newbie while remaining very powerful. It&#039;s probably not the right approach for this project, but a neat idea. Also an excuse to bump this thread <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Website: <a href="http://www.eero.com">http://www.eero.com</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drawz</strong> on 5 Feb 2015, 05:08)</p>

					<p>One more idea - <strong>Automated checksum during sysupgrade</strong> - OpenWrt reads the checksum from the file to be flashed and displays it to the user. It would be even better if it compared the checksum to the online (downloads.openwrt.org) md5sum file or allow you to also upload the md5sum file to the router for automatic comparison. Even better would be a &quot;check for new firmware&quot; option that would complete an automatic upgrade to the latest (stable) version.</p>									</div>

It&#039;s really not newbie friendly as it has some of the same pitfalls as OpenWrt (too many options that can break things), is not well organized, and has no guided setup/wizard. Did I mention it looks like it&#039;s from the 90s? It also happens to be one of the closed source components of DD-WRT. If OpenWrt is to emulate anything, I&#039;d suggest basing it on Tomato which is simple and clean. That said, I think OpenWrt with bootstrap can easiliy be evolved into something better and more modern.</p>									</div>
