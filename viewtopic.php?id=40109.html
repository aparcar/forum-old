					<p>I am trying to install OpenWRT on a Rosewill RNX-N150RT, which is a rebadged TP-Link TL-WR741ND v1. Trying to flash r29592 directly yields the error message</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Error code: 18005

Upgrade unsuccessfully because the version of the upgrade file was incorrect. Please check the file name.</code></pre></div><p>I tried renaming the file so it had the same name as the stock Rosewill firmware, but the result was the same. I tried flashing the TP-Link stock firmware, but that had the same error. <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/11693">Ticket 11693</a> says The &quot;Rosewill RNX-N150RT is a re-branded TP-Link WR741NDv1/v2 and only needs the Rosewill vendor byte in the header.&quot;</p><p>Would a little work with the hex editor take care of the problem? If so, what changes should I make?</p>									</div>

					<p>I was able to upgrade to OpenWRT by the following steps<br />1. upgrading to DD-WRT (see <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=729629)">http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=729629)</a><br />2. reverting the DD-WRT to the base TP-Link WR741NDv1 firmware (<a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=85237&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=293">http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic. â€¦ ;start=293</a>)<br />3. applying the latest OpenWRT build to the TP-Link build</p><p>There may be an easier way to accomplish this, but I&#039;ve not yet figured that out!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>richardowright</strong> on 3 Mar 2013, 20:45)</p>
