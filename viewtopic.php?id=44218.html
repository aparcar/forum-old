					<p>Hello Zajec, thanks for the reply.</p><p>- USB 3.0 I presume this is only a matter of time.

EA6500 / EA6700 should use the BCM4331<br />- is there a table of supported radio chipsets, please?<br />- No need for 802.11ac.<br />- BCM4360 not supported: Are you sure? Asus RT-AC66N seems to have the same chipset and from what I&#039;ve heard, DD-WRT is runnig there, so I presume, OpenWRT should as well. Or not?</p><p>I would like to have this HW because: USB 3.0, 3x3 instead of 2x2, Gigabit WLAN, CPU able to encrypt higher VPN/IPSec transfer rates. I would prefer to stay with one device for at least few years. Money&#039;s not the issue. The HW capability and support for OpenWRT is. Any ideas / updates folks, please?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

The EA6500 is MIPS based and uses a BCM4706. All the Broadcom devices with USB 3.0 support are using a ARM SoC and they are not supported by OpenWrt, OpenWrt will not even boot.

					<p>It is a Broadcom ARM SoC, here are some informations:<br /><a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/5925/broadcom-announces-bcm4708x-and-bcm5301x-socs-for-80211ac-routers">http://www.anandtech.com/show/5925/broa … ac-routers</a></p><p>It seams to use the ai bus (bcma) in a little bit modified version.<br />The operating system shared code is structured the same as for mips so I would hope we just need some little modifications to bcma to make that part work.<br />Then there is new platform code for arm needed. This platform code also contains some Ethernet mac driver so it could be that bgmac will not work.</p><p>Source code for these SoC is available from Linksys and from Netgear:<br /><a href="ftp://downloads.netgear.com/files/GPL/R6250-V1.0.0.70_1.0.70_src.tar.zip">ftp://downloads.netgear.com/files/GPL/R … rc.tar.zip</a></p>									</div>

					<p>i just compiled dropbear from source you supplied, put it on flashdrive and added some script into the startup sequence.</p><p>Now i made it better - i put dropbear into firmware (removed some linksys rubbish to make things fit) and put tools i need into the large JFFS we have.

					<p>This router uses a very different chipset from the rt-ac66u that one is mips this is arm, most info is probably not all that applicable from the rt-ac66u. The rt-ac68u however is the similar arm router from asus. Those missing components are built into the binary drivers that reside in GPL tarballs, probably best to just try and patch those to work if possible anything else is probably too complicated unless broadcom releases better source. You can get a good amount of information by decompiling the drivers but actually reimplementing components could be tricky.</p>									</div>
