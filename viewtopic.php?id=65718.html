					<p>I want to custom build my OpenWRT But problem is when I include the packages which I need, it does not make the squashfactory.bin file in /bin/ARxx directory. Can anyone guide me what am I missing? Also how can I insert my own Shell scripts in init.d befor generation of Custom OpenWrt?</p>									</div>

					<p>Can you explain, how you are including your packages ? Did you update feeds and then make menuconfig ? </p><p>I&#039;d check if those packages actually exist out there. Typically, when the build fails, there is a error message with the details of missing package. Remove that from your config.</p><p>I can&#039;t comment on your other question.</p>									</div>
