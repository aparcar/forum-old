					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m new in the openwrt world but I finally managed to make a home-made &#039;NAS&#039;. I have an USB hub which has a 8GB pendrive in the first port and an external HDD in the second(powered). I have a 512mb swap partition and an ext4 partition for extroot(pivot overlay) on the pendrive. On the 500gb hdd i have only one ext4 partition to store data. I have installed minidlna, samba and transmission. I also enabled inotify and hd-idle for the external hdd. Everything is working fine. I connect the mr3420 through the wan port to my zyxel router, dhcp is configured for the wan interface. In the firewall settings I changed the wan zone config to accept input, output, forward plus disabled masquerading and MSS clamping. When I add a torrent file to transmission cpu usage goes to avg. 90-100% while connected to only 6-10 peers. Memory usage: avg. 800-900k is free of the 32MB. My only problem is that I have a 60mbps&nbsp; internet connection and I can not reach the download speed I can reach on my pc using uTorrent(or my synology NAS). Current down speed shows only the max of 2MB/s but usually it is 1.4. but on the NAS I can reach 4-8MB/s(yes, my download speed can be more sometimes than it is promised). Also everything goes very unstable and slow(ssh, luci, my native transmission remote client keeps reconnecting). DLNA seems to be fine while downloading. I tried playing with disk cache mb, setting it higher (8mb) made download speed go under 300KB/s and cpu usage went down but down speed didnt go up. So the default 2mb seems to be the best choice. Of course only one torrent file is running, the others are in seeding state or stopped, but port for seeding not yet forwarded so no seeding is happening. Download speed is also very unstable jumping down to 300KB/s than going up to 2.1-2.2 MB/s, than jump down again to 1.4MB/s. When I access my shared folder through samba writing speeed is the maximum(100mbps).</p><p>Hopefully there is a solution for my problem.<br />Thanks for your help.</p><p>PS: i am on trunk(BB) and 2.84 transmission.</p>									</div>

					<p>I helped a friend to configure a Seagate GoFLEX Home 1TB with a self-build OpenWRT from trunk connected behind a 60Mbps cable modem through an 8-port 10/100 Mbps switch. Both the Seagate GoFLEX Home and my computer have Gigabit Ethernet ports. Using scp utility, I can get an average of 7.3 MBps max throughput to send/receive a huge file (600+ MB) between the Seagate GoFLEX Home (root) and my computer (user). However, the max through drops to 2 MBps when I transfer the same file to the Seagate GoFLEX Home (user). I don&#039;t know why, but it is kind of weird to have the mqx throughput drops from 7.3 MBps to 2 MBps switching from root to user.</p>									</div>
