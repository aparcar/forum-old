					<p>Hello,<br />I try to run Owrt to on a x86_64 platform. I used &quot;openwrt-15.05.1-x86-64-combined-ext4.img.gz&quot; to <strong>dd</strong> it on a USB stick.<br />But there is no way to boot through, it always hangs after &quot;<strong>random: nonblocking pool is initialized</strong>.<br />I tried several machines, all the same result. The WAN port gets an IP if the cable is in.<br />LAN and WAN NIC are r8169 Realtek<br />The WiFi Mini PCIe is an Atheros AR5B225 with an AR9485 chipset.<br />Having that boot problem on different machines I guess its not one of the NICs.<br />I expanded the systempartion to 500MB. That didn&#039;t do anything either. </p><p>I looked around for three days now and came up with nothing.</p><p>Does anyone has a clue what I&#039;m missing.</p><p>Thank you for your help</p>									</div>

					<p>Since OpenWrt is usually used &quot;headless&quot;, there is no keyboard driver in the builds.&nbsp; To take control of the machine you need use another computer to http&nbsp; telnet or SSH in on the Ethernet.</p>									</div>

					<p>Did that change somewhen in the recent past?<br />I remember putting BB stable on both, Virtualbox and VMware ESX and I&#039;m sure the virtual keyboard can be used.<br />Pretty much according to this how to: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/virtualbox">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/virtualbox</a></p><p>Please excuse me for not adding something to the problem, but at least &quot;there is no keyboard driver&quot; is not what I experienced.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>golialive</strong> on 29 Dec 2016, 20:46)</p>

					<p>That is a little different.&nbsp; If you take an X86 box and boot it cold into OpenWrt with no other OS, it is very likely that USB keyboards will not work.</p><p>&quot;Nonblocking pool is initialized&quot; is normally the last thing to happen during a good boot, unless some problem occurs later.</p>									</div>

					<p>it depends on motherboard manufacturer.</p><p>some motherboards properly emulate a USB keyboard as if it was a PS/2 Keyboard so it even works in DOS mode without any kind of USB drivers loaded. Same case with other USB devices like USB Flash Drive that emulates it as a physical HDD.</p><p>I still remember that I was able to setup my own x86 build openwrt machine using only but USB device.</p><p>the last line in my console once its done booting up, it always shows a message something like, &quot;Please, press enter to activate this console.&quot; I think.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello mk24,<br />THX for the info about the USB Keyboard. An old PS2 works fine. Busy Box CLI was there all the time. The problem is DHCP does not work. My test PC doesn&#039;t get a IP. even a staic IP 192.168.1.x does not give me excess to the Web interface.<br />Got to do some look around</p>									</div>
