					<p>HI!</p><p>I&#039;m using a TP link WR940N with Backfire 10.03.1, since it is stable, my question is how to disable one of the three RF output(antennas) that it has got. I mean, I have attached one antenna through I transmit with but I would like to disable the other two output in order not to have interference, how can I do that via software?? I have been reading this link <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless</a> , but there doesn&#039;t explain how to dissable it, only how to enable...</p><p>Other option I was thinking of was using the command iw like this</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iw wlan0 radio0 set antenna 0x5</code></pre></div><p>Because I have read in iw help&nbsp; that with 0x7&nbsp; enables the antennas, so if I want to disable one of the antennas should I use that commad,shouldn&#039;t I?</p><p>thanks in advance,</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ndarkness</strong> on 6 Aug 2012, 20:35)</p>
