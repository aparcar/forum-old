					<p>Hello,</p><p>This is what I want to do:<br />One of my neighbours have a Fonera, running a FON firmware (so there are the two networks : the FON_XXX one, and is private network)</p><p>I have a fonera running OpenWRT KAmikaze 7.09, and I want it to connect to the FON_XXX signal, and then 2 solutions:<br />- repeat the signal (which is very low) for my computers (2 laptops)<br />- create my own wireless network</p><p>What I want is to have the internet access on my two laptops, but the signal is too low in order to use the computer well : there is one place in the room where the signal is good, and it&#039;s not very easy to be there <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> But a fonera could easily be in that place.<br />So here comes my idea to repeat or create a new signal...</p><p>After a lot of tries, I can&#039;t succeed in having such a configuration.</p><br /><p>Thx a lot to anyone who could help me !</p><p>ps: it&#039;s for an holiday house, here at home, I have my own fonera running a FON firmware.</p>									</div>

					<p>Do you have other wireless clients connected to your private FON network? If you create your own wireless network on the second fonera, you will have a firewall in between.<br />I&#039;d prefer to create my own wireless network on the second fonera, it&#039;s independent of the connection to the primary fonera, which would serve DHCP, ... in the other scenario.<br />If your signal is weak, you could attach a larger antenna to any of the foneras.</p><p>To create two wireless networks on the fonera you could use the following setup:</p><p>/etc/config/wireless<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-device  wifi0
        option type     atheros
        option channel  4

#first wireless, will be ath0, is your second private subnet
config wifi-iface
        option device       wifi0
        option network      lan
        option mode         ap
        option ssid         &quot;privatessid&quot;
        option encryption   &quot;psk&quot;
        option key          &quot;privatepassphrase&quot;


#second wireless will be ath1, is you primary private FON subnet
config wifi-iface
        option device   wifi0
        option mode     sta
        option ssid     FON_private
        option encryption psk
        option key      &quot;yourpassphrase&quot;</code></pre></div><p>/etc/config/network<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface lan
        option type     bridge
        option ifname   eth0
        option proto    static
# must be different from subnet of primary fonera
        option ipaddr   192.168.55.1
        option netmask  255.255.255.0

config interface wan
        option ifname   ath1
        option proto    dhcp</code></pre></div><p>Modify /etc/config/dhcp as well to suite your needs.</p><p>You will need wpa_supplicant and hostapd installed.</p><p>I hope this helps, this config is not an actual config of one of my routers, so it may contain minor errors.</p><p>The ethernet port on the seconds fonera is connected to the lan subnet, so you could connect additional devices directly or via a switch.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MMCM</strong> on 22 Feb 2008, 12:21)</p>
