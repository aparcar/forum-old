					<p>Actually we are using about 50 devices of a MT7620A-based router from movingcomm.com. <br />However, this device type is out of production now. <br />The firmware is customized, we set it up ourselves, based on a SDK from the vendor, which is in fact a patched version of CC, running a 3.18 kernel, using MT7620A-EVB as basis.<br />For long-time support, is there any developer able and willing, for a fee, to be negotiated, to apply these patches into current official openwrt-/LEDE distribution, to be supported in the future ?</p><p> An alternative would be, as a private, closed-sourcce solution, to modify the existing patch set, to be used on actual openwrt-/LEDE-source tree, like 17.01.04 or upcoming, next release.</p>									</div>
