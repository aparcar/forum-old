					<p>Hi!</p><p>For getting Internet Access I have to use PPTP. The ADSL-modem has the IP 10.0.0.138, to dial in, a device 10.0.0.140 has to open a pptp connection. It&#039;s exactly the thing that is described in the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/Faq#head-6faef78fc87ad815335a6b0500842bb1535f6fbd/">WhiteRussion/How Do I configure PPTP for Internet access</a> entry in the FAQ. </p><p>But with Kamikaze 7.09 i just can&#039;t get the connection up and running. Here&#039;s my /etc/config/network: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#### VLAN configuration
config switch eth0
        option vlan0    &quot;0 1 2 3 5*&quot;
        option vlan1    &quot;4 5&quot;


#### Loopback configuration
config interface loopback
        option ifname   &quot;lo&quot;
        option proto    static
        option ipaddr   127.0.0.1
        option netmask  255.0.0.0


#### LAN configuration
config interface lan
        option type     bridge
        option ifname   &quot;eth0.0&quot;
        option proto    static
        option ipaddr   192.168.2.15
        option netmask  255.255.255.0


#### WAN configuration
config interface        wan
        option ifname   &quot;eth0.1&quot;
        option proto    static
        option ipaddr   10.0.0.140
        option netmask  255.255.255.0

config interface        ppp0
        option ifname   &quot;eth0.2&quot;
        option proto    pptp
        option server   10.0.0.138
        option username &quot;my-ISP-username&quot;
        option password &quot;my-ISP-password&quot;
        option keepalive        10
        option mtu      1492</code></pre></div><p>When working, the ppp0 interface should obtain a dynamically assigned WAN-IP from my ISP server. Using the PPTP-for-internet-access settings as described in the FAQ worked out of the box with WhiteRussian releases. If you have any idea how to configure the Kamikaze-box please let me know. The PPTP-package is installed. </p><p>Thanks in advance<br />Stephan</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>roedel</strong> on 2 Oct 2007, 14:38)</p>

					<p>Some time ago, I couldn&#039;t get it to work, too.<br />In the end, I wrote my own pppd start script, and tuned firewall rules to use ppp0 as the wan interface.<br />Still very buggy, when the connection gets dropped every 8h by AON (Austrian Telekom), it takes up to 15 minutes to reconnect.<br />I would never choose a provider with pptp access (this is not my own router).</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello All,</p><p>Yes, I also encountered some troubles with the default config in the kamikaze pppoe access. </p><p>I followed the instructions given on this page<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WRT54GL">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har … ys/WRT54GL</a></p><p>about PPPoE<br />-----------<br />With Kamikaze 7.09 PPPoE works out-of-the-box.

Sure, but the box is not nating and filtering in the correct way if I do that (even after a reboot), lan pc can get access to the net.</p><p>There are 2 main problems <br />one in the iptables (filter) FORWARD table <br />iptables -v -L FORWARD gives as last line<br />ACCEPT&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;all&nbsp; --&nbsp; br-lan eth0.1&nbsp; &nbsp; anywhere&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;anywhere<br />and iptables -v -t nat -L POSTROUTING gives as last line<br />MASQUERADE&nbsp; all&nbsp; --&nbsp; any&nbsp; &nbsp; eth0.1&nbsp; &nbsp; anywhere&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;anywhere</p><p>The problem is that in both lines, the output device should be ppp0 and not eth0.1<br />if you had these two lines :<br />itpables -A FORWARD -i br-lan -o ppp0 -j ACCEPT<br />itpables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ppp0 -j MASQUERADE<br />then everything works great</p><p>(Ooops, you also need to add your dns servers to /etc/resolv.conf) <br />I don t know how to do that via uci or webif.</p><p>I tried to change to /etc/config/network <br />from<br />#### WAN configuration<br />config interface&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;eth0.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;pppoe&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option username &#039;xxxx&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option password &#039;xxxx&#039;<br />(please replace xxx by something relevant !)</p><p>to <br />#### WAN configuration<br />config interface&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;ppp0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;pppoe&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option username &#039;xxxx&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option password &#039;xxxx&#039;</p><p>but then it s not possible to ifup wan, I got an error message.(sorry I can t play much wiht my router, and give you the exact error message).</p><p>My feeling is that there must be something messed up between eth0.1 and ppp0 in the default config. <br />Maybe the difference between ifname and wan_device... I don t know kamikaze enough and as my router is used days and nights by 35 people, it s hard to test it and report a bug in a beter way.</p><p>But there is a bug. </p><p>Openwrt people, help your poor users on that !!!</p><p>Steff</p>									</div>
