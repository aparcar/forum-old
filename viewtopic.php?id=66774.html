					<p>many thanks for ur response. actually i dont have idea how to revert back to stock firmware. i read somewhere in the forum that the image can be found in the hootoo website couldn&#039;t be used for reocvery. </p><p>somewhere i found this tutorial:</p><p>1. download latest firmware for your routers (makes it easy to rename it to something simple .bin)<br />2. download winscp (google it its FREE)<br />3. reset your router to default settings with a hard reset<br />4. login to your router 192.168.1.1 with the SCP protocol<br />5. upload your firmware to the /tmp directory (do not change directory!)<br />6. push ctrl+t or click on commands menu than on open terminal<br />7. type this command in:<br />mtd -r write firmware.bin firmware (change firmware.bin to your bin)</p><p>and i tried this method with your given link. that doesn&#039;t work. every times gives error. after trying this i should install openwrt again because the router didn&#039;t give me any signal.</p><p>i followed this process to install openwrt:</p><p>Download this OpenWrt firmware: Link<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Place it in the root of a clean TFTP server running on your computer.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Rename the image to kernel — be sure there is no file extension, and that there are no other files on the TFTP server.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Plug the HT-TM05 into your computer via ethernet.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Set your computer to use 10.10.10.254 as its IP address.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; With your HT-TM05 shut down, hold down the power button until the first white LED lights up.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Push and hold the reset button and release the power button. Continue holding the reset button for 30 seconds or until it begins searching for files on your TFTP server, whichever comes first.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The HT-TM05 will look for your computer at 10.10.10.254 and install the kernel file. Once it has finished installation of the kernel file, it will search for a (nonexistent) rootfs file — when it begins searching for this file, shut down the HT-TM05 by holding the power button normally.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Start up your HT-TM05 normally. When the Wi-Fi indicator turns green, OpenWrt has booted successfully.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>silentext</strong> on 12 Aug 2016, 16:54)</p>

					<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>I&#039;m interested to install OpenWRT on my HT-TM05... but as I was upgrading the original firmware from Hootoo, it seems I bricked the device :-S<br />Now, I can just turn ON / OFF by pressing the power button. When it&#039;s started,the Wi-Fi led is blue and I can&#039;t detect any SSID.<br />I tried to connect with a RJ45 cable, my laptop can&#039;t identify the network.<br />And lastly, when I try to force a reset to restore the TripMate to factory default, there si no effect.</p><p>Does someone know another way to reset or flash with another firmware ?<br />(I opened a ticket with Hootoo support. I&#039;m waiting the response)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Moonstone92</strong> on 18 Apr 2018, 17:53)</p>
