					<p>ok here is how I do it<br />in /lib/wifi/broadcom.sh</p><p>go to line 221, it looks like this:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; killall -KILL nas &gt;&amp;- 2&gt;&amp;-<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wlc stdin &lt;&lt;EOF</p><p>and make it look like this:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; killall -KILL nas &gt;&amp;- 2&gt;&amp;-<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wl gmode 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wlc stdin &lt;&lt;EOF</p><p>And that&#039;s it. So basically it sets the mode before all other things and before it brings up the interface and associates to anything.</p><p>But that&#039;s a really ugly way to do it. I needed it to work and fast and that&#039;s the quickest way of doing it. And the ugliest. Someone should modify that script to read agmode directive from /etc/config/wireless as it should.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>posix</strong> on 29 Mar 2008, 15:12)</p>

					<p>The problem with broadcom is that you cannot change modes once it has associated to another wireless node. With atheros you can but not with broadcom. That&#039;s why you have to do it BEFORE it has associated to something, and the only place to do it is in the initialisation step before the interface is brought up. Glad it helped!</p>									</div>
