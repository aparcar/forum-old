					<p>@northbound, I will probably test .13 after a few more days tracking on .14 on my WRT1200ac. A few hours ago my wife reported a crash when i was away, the router wan LED is gone and devices were offline so she turned off and on it. That can be the overheating problem? </p><p>For installing .13, just opkg install the .13 ipk file instead of a fresh rolling back, will it be ok?</p>									</div>
