					<p>I have an Archer C7 V2, running BARRIER BREAKER (14.07, r42625)</p><p>The router sits in the main floor living room, which is almost the center of my home. House is approximately 4000 sq ft with a basement and upper bonus room above garage.&nbsp; If I am in the kitchen or bonus upper area within 30-50 feet of the router the signal is between 2-3 bars out of four. If I am downstairs directly beneath the router area I have almost full signal and 2-3 bars anywhere else in the basement. However, if I am in my bedroom or office areas which are approximately 35-45 feet down the hall from the living room, signal drops to almost nothing.&nbsp; Maybe this is nothing to complain about. However, when I can see my neighbor&#039;s 5ghz wifi signal all throughout my home with full reception I feel like my access point is a bit inadequate. </p><p>Here is output from /etc/config/wireless:</p><p>config wifi-device &#039;radio0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option type &#039;mac80211&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option channel &#039;36&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option hwmode &#039;11a&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option path &#039;pci0000:01/0000:01:00.0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option htmode &#039;VHT80&#039;</p><p>config wifi-iface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;radio0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option mode &#039;ap&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ssid &#039;XS 5G&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option encryption &#039;psk2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option key &#039;xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option network &#039;User&#039;</p><p>config wifi-device &#039;radio1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option type &#039;mac80211&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option hwmode &#039;11g&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option path &#039;platform/qca955x_wmac&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option htmode &#039;HT40&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option txpower &#039;30&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option country &#039;US&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option channel &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option noscan &#039;1&#039;</p><p>config wifi-iface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;radio1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option mode &#039;ap&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ssid &#039;XS Guest&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option network &#039;Guest&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option encryption &#039;psk2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option key &#039;xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option isolate &#039;1&#039;</p><p>Doesn&#039;t seem to be a way to increase the txpower on the 5ghz, even with setting option txpower.</p><p>Any insights are appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>You are running a very old version of OpenWRT. Even the Chaos Calmer is a bit aged right now. Do you have some valid reason why you haven&#039;t upgraded to the latest release? Perhaps you should consider upgrading all the way to LEDE (an OpenWRT fork)?</p>									</div>

I have a currently working configuration, everything works well despite one or two things, like the 5ghz wifi signal strength.&nbsp; I basically have a dumb switch setup and no services, e.g., dhcp, nat, firewall, are being provided by openwrt, rather a pfsense box.

					<p>You are correct about the old adage &quot;If it works, don&#039;t touch it.&quot;</p><p>Since the gap between BB and latest LEDE release is quite big from the changes perspective, I cannot say this or that regarding how available functionality or features might&#039;ve developed in the meantime. I do believe most of the critical components, such as VLANs, NAT, firewall etc. have either improved, or the very least stayed the same.</p><p>If your bootloader supports uploading a precompiled image into the router&#039;s memory and running it from there, you could try setting up a virtual machine with a LEDE buldroot environment, and then stitch up a minimal ramdisk-variant for your router. </p><p>That would allow you to run LEDE on your router without flashing and replacing the current working &amp; stable setup. Using it requires access to the bootloader, and the bootloader must support uploading an image through TFTP or similar protocol to memory, and running it from there.</p><p>Compiling the image yourself would allow you to enable and test those features which you want to verify, and leave all non-critical things out. Depending on RAM size of your router, it might even be necessary to optimize the image so it is runnable.</p>									</div>

However, I am still plagued with the extremely poor wifi signal. This is the first 5ghz wifi router I have owned so I do not know if this is just the limitation of 5ghz network or what. However, like I mentioned, when I am only getting 2-3 bars or less in my home, unless I am in line of sight to the AP, and I can see my neighbor&#039;s network throughout my house and even on the edges of my property far from his and its at full strength, it makes me wonder if there is a problem or not.</p>									</div>

					<p>I only know he is using a Netgear, based on the SSID. I am almost certain he is not techie, so I doubt he has done any modifications of his system.&nbsp; I just don&#039;t understand why my signal is 1 bar in my office and bedrooms with the device being 35 feet away. I have tried changing the channel and txpower to no avail or change. Maybe this router just isn&#039;t capable of providing anything better. The 2.4 GHz has no issues.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi when you upgraded to LEDE did you save settings. If you did I would start from scratch. One more thing is where is your router located? Lots of things can mess with 5 ghz signals like any metel plating, screens, Big PSUs, fridges/freezers and AV aquwipment all sow if your naber is using some kind of wif-i amp to boost signal your router could be getting dround out by the bleed over from harmonics.</p>									</div>
