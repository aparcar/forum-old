					<p>Hi gang, has there been any update to LUCI yet to include 802.11n support option in the GUI?&nbsp; Just curious.&nbsp; I am trying to get my e3000 working full-featured with&nbsp; BARRIER BREAKER (14.07).&nbsp; I was able to get the proprietary driver working at one point, but only in 54G mode.&nbsp; This forum gives me hope.&nbsp; </p><p>Thanks!<br />-R</p>									</div>
