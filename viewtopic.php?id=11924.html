					<p>Hi,</p><p>I cannot get my laserjet 1020 USB-printer to work. The printer works fine with my debian or windows box if connected directly.</p><br /><p>I used the howto @ <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/KamikazeConfiguration">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Kam â€¦ figuration</a> under 2.0.3 and <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/PrinterSharingHowto">http://wiki.openwrt.org/PrinterSharingHowto</a></p><br /><p>I tryed usb 1.1 drivers only and 2.0 drivers only...with the same results. I tested under kamikaze 7.07 and WR 0.9. </p><br /><p>The usb and printer driver seem to load successfully:</p><br /><p>Jan&nbsp; 1 00:17:07 (none) kern.info kernel: hub.c: new USB device 01:03.2-2, assigned address 4<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 00:17:07 (none) kern.info kernel: printer.c: usblp0: USB Bidirectional printer dev 4 if 0 alt 0 proto 2 vid 0x03F0 pid 0x2B17</p><p>I load the firmware with &#039;cat /usr/lib/fw/sihp1020.dl &gt; /dev/usb/lp0&#039; which takes ~ 1sec and doesn&#039;t give any errors. I also used a hotplug script for firmware loading, but printer simply doesn&#039;t print anything. </p><p>ps -aux shows that p910nd is running:&nbsp; &nbsp;720 root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 260 S&nbsp; &nbsp;p9100d -b -f /dev/usb/lp0 0&nbsp; &nbsp;; with bidirectional printing and the correct device. It is active @port 9100 and if i try to print over the network with windows or linux (cups) client, the following appears in &#039;logread&#039;:</p><p>Jan&nbsp; 1 02:00:12 (none) kern.notice p9100d[720]: Connection from 192.168.0.33 port 44626 accepted <br />Jan&nbsp; 1 02:00:12 (none) kern.notice p9100d[720]: Finished job: 1520 bytes received, 0 bytes sent </p><p>What&#039;s maybe interesting, it NEVER has anything &#039;sent&#039;, always 0bytes .. is this normal?</p><p>I installed the foo2zjs stuff under linux and the original HP driver under windows. With both setups i can print, if the laserjet is directly connected via USB.</p><p>Please help! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>freezer2k</strong> on 3 Aug 2007, 22:33)</p>

					<p>Hello<br />I use LJ 1018 with p9100d&nbsp; and it works well.</p><p>Can you check if your firmware loads successfully? You can check it using tool from <a href="http://oleg.wl500g.info/hplj/">http://oleg.wl500g.info/hplj/</a><br />Just run usb_printerid, it should display something like that:<br />MFG:Hewlett-Packard;MDL:HP LaserJet 1018;CMD:ACL;CLS:PRINTER;DES:HP LaserJet 1018;FWVER:20051028;</p><p>if firmware is not loaded, it will never display &quot;FWVER:.*&quot;</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks man!</p><p>I loaded the firmware and used this printerid tool, it didn&#039;t show any FWVER.</p><p>Then i compared the sizes of the firmware file from the oleg site and the FW i downloaded over the foo2zjs package....</p><p>&nbsp; 188&nbsp; 123 -rw-r--r--&nbsp; &nbsp; 1 root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;126100 Jan&nbsp; 1 00:08 fw.old<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 201&nbsp; 123 -rw-r--r--&nbsp; &nbsp; 1 root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;126151 Jan&nbsp; 1 08:39 sihp1020.dl</p><br /><p>fw.old is the foo2zjs ./getweb firmware. For some reason it is 51bytes smaller...</p><p>Anyway. I loaded the oleg FW file and in the same moment the printer did some &#039;bootup stuff&#039;, means it began to blink and buzz <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Now printing over p910nd works just fine :-) So it seems like getweb puts out some corrupted firmware!?</p><br /><p>Greetings,<br />Freezer</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>freezer2k</strong> on 5 Aug 2007, 12:38)</p>

					<p>I believe there is some header or footer in the firmware file.<br />Can you try to diff these files to check it out?</p>									</div>

					<p>The main difference seems to be really some sort of init code:</p><p>&quot;^[%-12345X@PJL ENTER LANGUAGE=ACL<br />^@???^@^A??&quot; </p><p>After this first 46? bytes both files are very equal. Next thing after init is &quot;20041129^?ELF^A^B^A^ ...&quot; which, of course, is the first thing in the getweb version!</p><p>I tryed to cut off the first 51bytes, but since the init code is only 46bytes (did not count exactly, but def. not 51) long, 51bytes is too much. So there will be some/an other little differences in the files. </p><p>The firmware versions seem to be the same &quot;20041129&quot; so i guess version from 11-29-2004 ..</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>freezer2k</strong> on 6 Aug 2007, 21:42)</p>
