					<p>I&#039;m running LEDE Reboot r1442 on a BT Home Hub V5 and my ISP is Sky Fibre, I am running it as a combined VDSL modem and router. Everything is working as expected apart from when using Android Lollipop devices that connect over Wi-Fi (Nexus 4, Amazon Fire Tablet and Amazon Fire Stick). The problem is related to DNS and I am unable to browse the web without using some kind of DNS setting application. I can ping and traceroute, it&#039;s just DNS that is giving me hell.</p><p>When using this DNS setting application I can manually set Google, OpenDNS and my router IP (192.168.0.1) and it works, this leads me to believe either something is not being passed with the DHCP info or something is not being set on the Android devices properly.</p><p>I have multiple devices that work perfectly well, Mac OS, Windows, iOS and even Android 4. I have an Amazon Fire TV that runs the same OS as the Fire Stick but is connected over Ethernet, this works as expected too.</p><p>I don&#039;t have any such problems using the ISP supplied combined VDSL mode + router which leads me to believe there is either something I am not setting correctly, some kind of compatibility issue or a bug somewhere in LEDE/dnsmasq/Android 5.</p><p>Things I&#039;ve tried:</p><p>Assigning a static IP and DNS on the Android devices, I feel like this should work because the &#039;Set DNS&#039; application works but I still can&#039;t resolve this way.<br />Various different Wi-Fi settings - N-mode on/off, WMM mode on/off, all different security types and disabling it.<br />Sending DHCP option 6 with various DNS addresses (Google, OpenDNS, etc).<br />Disconnecting all wired clients from the router.<br />Removing all wireless networks and creating from scratch with different SSID.<br />Toggling Wi-Fi on/off, rebooting device, forgetting and reconnecting to wireless networks.<br />I also had this same problem using a trunk version of OpenWrt r49230 which is what prompted me to try LEDE in the hope it may have been some kind of regression that got fixed.</p><p>I guess what I am looking for is some pointers on how I can diagnose what might be the problem. I don&#039;t have root access on any of the Android devices but am happy to set it up on the Nexus 4 if needed.</p><p>Can anyone point me in any kind of direction here please?

					<p>Dear Alexstan,</p><p>please ignore Max&#039;s antics, he acts as this forum&#039;s resident troll ATM and hence can safely be ignored (unless your problem is using a search machine and roughly appropriate search terms). His remark about double posting* is somewhat besides the mark as your title shows that you did something different than last time and you included a list of things you tested unsuccessfully, which is certainly worth posting (that said a link to the old thread might still be helpful to get more information about the manifestation of the issue). I might well be that all Max wanted to raise is that it would be nice tho have the new information at least linked to the old, but if so I believe his impolite terseness does not help in that quest.</p><p>Regarding your real issue, I will test my old nexus4 against the LEDE HEAD, r1398 I have currently installed later today, and will report back here, whether it works, we can then go and look at configuration differences.</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p><br /><p>*) Max&#039;s biggest problem with the rest of the forum users seems to be simple procedural issues about what to post where and when; which is interesting since I do not recall him ever posting his instructions on how to use this forum. Combined with his &quot;delusion&quot; that people actually appreciate his help in selecting search terms and using search engines it at least explains the reputation/notoriety he earned in this forum. Which is sad, as occasionally he can be really helpful.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi moeller0, thanks for your reply. Although Max&#039;s reply was a little harsh I am not bothered and understand the reasoning behind it. As you say, I should have linked to my previous post as it is related to this issue...I&#039;m not sure he needs to do the whole LMGTFY routine though...</p><p>I think I may have found a solution upon further investigation, it looks as though there is a problem with Android trying to use ipv6 DNS when it should be using ipv4. When I disabled ipv6 both in WAN and LAN in /etc/config/network and rebooted then the Android devices were able to connect. I am currently doing some more tests to see if I can narrow it down further.</p><p>I got the idea from this Android bug report (incidentally the first result in Max&#039;s LMGTFY link - I had already read it a few times but not tried every solution suggested)<br /><a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=79504">code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=79504</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>alexstan</strong> on 29 Aug 2016, 17:47)</p>

					<p>Just to update this issue, manually feeding through the external IPV6 DNS servers does fix the issue, but then it messes up any LAN IPv6 stuff as the local addresses won&#039;t be setup correctly (the DNS server won&#039;t know how to find if the devices tries IPv6 DNS over IPv4 DNS).</p><p>However, dnsmasq 2.77 fixes this issue and automatic IPv6 DNS servers now correctly point to the router, which resolves the Android issue.</p><p>I know LEDE 17.01.2 and LEDE trunk both have this version baked in. Otherwise, it should be possible to do a package upgrade on openWRT or LEDE (or just build a new custom image).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>TeutonJon78</strong> on 20 Jun 2017, 02:45)</p>
