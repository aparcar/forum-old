					<p>Hi,</p><p>If I set the router to get IP dynamically via WAN port, what command can I use to get such information about the IP, DNS, GW (e.g. from the ISP)? I listed all packages but did not see any DHCP client package listed. Is that built in somehow in the box?</p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you,</p><p>Can you let me know where I can find the network scripts? Actually I am quite new to this router and I just use White Russian RC2 (squash image) and after rebooting I telnet in and now ssh-in. Is there anyway I can see how the network script starts/stop etc? I do not have serial port, just the router from the shop.</p>									</div>

					<p>The startup scripts reside in the /etc/init.d directory. If you look at the S40network script you should find the command that brings up the &quot;wan&quot; interface:</p><p>ifup wan</p><p>The &quot;ifup&quot; command is actually a script. Take a look at /sbin/ifup. In that script you will see where it parses the nvram variables and when it comes across &quot;wan_proto&quot; you&#039;ll see a section that gets executed when an interface is set to dhcp. This is where the call to &quot;udhcp&quot; is.</p><p>If you just want to view your gateway and ip address information you can use a few commands like &quot;ifconfig&quot;, &quot;ip&quot;, and &quot;netstat&quot;. For instance, &quot;netstat -rn&quot; will show you your routing table. &quot;ifconfig&quot; will list all the interfaces and their currently configured ip address information. The &quot;ip&quot; command can also show you various IP information about your interface(s). &quot;ip addr&quot; and &quot;ip route&quot; will show you somewhat similar information.</p><p>Your DNS server information goes in /etc/resolv.conf. If configured by DHCP you will find a /tmp/resolv.conf. You might want to symbolic link /etc/resolv.conf to /tmp/resolv.conf if you want to use your provider&#039;s DNS servers for resolution.</p>									</div>
