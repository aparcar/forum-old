					<p>I am a beginner in this field so the following question can be something very trivial and pointless.</p><p>I am trying to configure 802.11n. On the web I found that I can enable the short guard interval capabality by setting the option ht_capab in the /etc/config/wireless file.</p><p>For example something like the following: ht_capab=[HT40-][SHORT-GI-20][SHORT-GI-40]</p><p> I just do not know if this is all that is required and in any case how can I confirm the change in the new configuration. Is there a way for me to read back the settings from the Ath9k driver.</p>									</div>
