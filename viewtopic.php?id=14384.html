					<p>Hi, I&#039;ve recently setup a v1.1 WRT54GS with Kamikaze (2.4 kernel). I&#039;m running it as a bridge off of my existing LAN, with all 100bT ports in the same vlan and a DHCP-assigned ip addy for the WRT itself.</p><p>What I&#039;ve come to notice is that after a period of time after a reboot my Wifi signal is no longer &#039;visible&#039;. That period of time is anywhere from a couple to 10 days. By not being visible I mean that 2 PC&#039;s (rebooted, etc) using Ubuntu/XP cannot detect the SSID of my WRT. Normally (e.g. always after a reboot and for some time thereafter) they can.</p><p>FWIW I&#039;m presently using the WRT more for the 100bT port expansion than wireless expansion, however I&#039;d like to make the wireless 100% good so that in the future it&#039;s there for me.</p><p>My syslog shows nothing unusual (except occasionally matrixtunnel cannot establish a connection ... but https access works fine).</p><p>My other systems all look good.</p><p>Has anyone heard of this issue or does anyone have any good starting points for diagnostics?</p><p>I&#039;ve just rebooted - when it happens next time which files/info are useful to provide for debugging?</p><p>TIA for any assistance!</p>									</div>
