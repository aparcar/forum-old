					<p>Greetings,<br />I am new to these forums so I apologize in advance if I ask for help in the wrong place:</p><p>I got a used (like new) Compex NP-28G router which I planned to use mostly as wireless access point + USB web-camera survelliance.<br />One of the reasons I bought it in the first place was because the manual stated it supports webcams out of the box.<br />For the survelliance I&#039;ve purchased Logitech QuickCam Orbit (mentioned as one of the supported devices) but unfortunately it does not work with Compex firmware.<br />The reason is because I actually got Logitech QuickCam Orbit MP version which is better than the regular Logitech QuickCam Orbit but uses a different chipset.<br />The old Logitech QuickCam Orbit is supported by &quot;pwc&quot; driver which is available in Compex NP-28G out of the box, while the newer MP version needs uvc driver which exists for Linux but not as part of Compex firmware. Unfortunately Compex firmware is not available as source code so you cannot add the driver there.</p><p>Since I did not want to lose my money spent on the router and the webcam, I browsed the internet to try to find a solution. I learned that Compex NP-28G actually uses embedded Linux and you can put any distribution there, not just the factory Compex one. This is how I came to this site (OpenWRT.org) and found out about OpenWRT distribution, which looks like a decent solution to my challenge plus it&#039;s open-source and free, so I will be able to change and customize it even more in the future.</p><p>After browsing the forums for a while, I got an impression that although the Wiki page states that NP-28G is not supported, in reality it is already supported with Kamikaze and it&#039;s possible even to download a ready bin snapshot. This is what I did by downloading &quot;openwrt-adm5120-np28g-squashfs.bin&quot; from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/adm5120/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/adm5120/</a></p><p>I also read the instructions for installing OpenWRT and got the impression that you can use the bin file with the vendor &quot;Firmware upgrade&quot; web-based interface. So I did, and after the firmware was flashed successfully, the router stopped working <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> So I read about reviving the router via TFTP, and revived it back with factory firmware. Then I tried to flash it with &quot;openwrt-adm5120-np28g-squashfs.bin&quot; via TFTP, but got the same result - router stops working. I tried also the openwrt-adm5120-np28g-jffs2.bin both via the web interface and via the TFTP, to same result. When I try the TRX version, both the web-interface and the TFTP do not accept it. Web interface says that it&#039;s bad firmware (the bin files were accepted fine), and during TFTP the diagnosis LED flashes with status that says the same (bad firmware).</p><p>So thank you for reading so far, and I would be really grateful if someone could point it out to me what I am doing wrong <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />I understand there is also a possibility to connect a COM-port to the router to watch the console, but I prefer not to disassembly it unless absolutely necessary.<br />I have seen quite a lot of console (loader) outputs posted here in the forums - do people always use the COM-port connection to get them, or is there any other way?<br />Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p><p>Thanks,<br />Yogev</p>									</div>

					<p>I wonder if anyone actually managed to install OpenWRT on that router - I&#039;ve seen a few posts on these forums and on the net that it&#039;s possible, but no guidelines so far <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>

Can you please rephrase it?<br />I think if you can just release a firmware which supports also UVC-type cameras, I pay for it but it will be very good for other users as well, since there are a lot of cameras in the market now that do not work with Philips driver that you have in the router (pwc). So I will be happy that I can pay to help other people as well.<br />Maybe you can also update the MyLoader bootloader that is inside the router, to the latest version you have.</p></blockquote></div><p>I hope this helps.<br />Yogev</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey yapoo,<br />I wonder how did you manage to get &quot;MyLoader version 2.31.0310&quot;? Was it there from the beginning?<br />The latest firmware image I get from Compex shows version 2.27 (However this is only from the web-gui of Compex, since I did not open the device yet. So maybe it&#039;s not the correct version.) I wonder if changing the loader to 2.31 or any newer version, will solve my problem?</p><p>EDIT: I wonder if it&#039;s possible to reflash the Compex firmware but with a newer bootloader. i.e. take MyLoader version 2.43 for example, and replace with it the version 2.27 that I have inside the firmware image, leaving the rest of the image as is?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>yogev_ezra</strong> on 25 Oct 2008, 19:49)</p>

					<p>Hi, yogev_ezra.</p><p>Yes, from the beginning.<br />My device&#039;s model is mg-11g, a OEM of np-28g.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Please see this thread http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=10844
Thank you for your information about this. 
Unfortunately This product does not support OpenWRT. 

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I had a important information recently.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The last post said that only MyLoader V2.4 above supports OpenWRT.
Yes, Only Loader Version 2.4 or above is support OpenWRT for WP54,WP18
and WP188 Only
For your NP28G(MG-11G) is not supported version, so sorry about this.

For you information
Compex&#039;s Product that support OpenWRT
1. You may log on to http://compex.com.sg/home/OEM/Open_wrt.htm to check
the version that support OpenWRT since more and more products from
Compex will support OpenWRT.
2. The product (Wp54,WP18 and WP188) that support OpenWRT work well and
tested by our team and have more support from us. So i would like to
suggest you to have a supported version and also the development kit if
you to play around with OpenWRT  :-) 

Thank you for choosing Compex Product.

					<p>Hi yapoo,</p><p>This cable is a problem for me since I would like to keep the router box closed.<br />So I want to open it once, attach the USB board inside and extrude a connector through a hole that I would cut in the plastic box of the router. This way I can access the router anytime I want with just a regular USB cable without having to open the box again.</p><p>I have ordered 2 copies of this USB board from SparkFun. When it arrives, I hope my father will be able to solder it (he&#039;s electic technician so he is familiar with those kinds of things).</p>									</div>

					<p>I have some news for you <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>First, I received a reply from Compex sales. Unfortunately they demand too much money for it, as Gabor already predicted:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>From: EsTHeR &lt;xxxxx@compex.com.sg&gt;<br />To: Yogev Ezra &lt;xxxxxx@xxxxx&gt;<br />Cc: &quot;Compex (Singapore)&quot; &lt;support@compex.com.sg&gt;<br />Date: Tue, Nov 4, 2008 at 12:25 PM<br />Subject: Re: Problem with Compex NetPassage 28G + Logitech Orbit MP camera</p><p>Dear Yogev,</p><p>We are more on the hardware product instead of the developement of the software, hence, if you would pay&nbsp; for the development to support Web cam Logitech Orbit MP with with our NP28G . </p><p>I regret to inform you that the final decision&nbsp; is that there will be a charges of&nbsp; USD 8k. As our R&amp;D need time to look for the driver and also to purchase the Web cam etc. just to develop the firmware for you if you would like us to help you on developing the firmware of our EOL NP28 for the Web cam support.</p><p>Regards<br />Esther</p></blockquote></div><p>Sadly, this is way beyond my budget, so I have to find other methods to make it work <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>I also received the 2 breakout boards from SparkFun today in the mail. They look really cute <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /> I thought they would be bigger (guess I was confused by the oversize picture). Now I only need to ask my father to solder the board with the Compex NP28G and I will check if I am able to see the console!</p>									</div>
