					<p>Hello again folks, </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;m the guy with the Asus RT-N13U B1 (Ralink RT3052 based) routers that I&#039;m trying to make a stable home network with.&nbsp; In poking around on my boxes loaded with BB (14.07-rc3, r42056), I found that the following messages were filling up my kernel logs:&nbsp; </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Sun Mar 22 21:57:34 2015 kern.warn kernel: [86688.200000] ieee80211 phy0: rt2x00queue_flush_queue: Warning - Queue 0 failed to flush
