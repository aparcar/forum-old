					<p>This is probably a pretty straightforward thing for most people on here so I apologize if it seems simple/obvious but I was wondering exactly how you snap the Broadcom Mini-PCI card out of the Asus WL-500g Premium to switch it out?</p><p>I ask because I soldered some UART connections last night (successfully) and was trying to snap it out to get better positioning on the entire board. The snappable metal tabs on either side were pretty tight, and when I attempted to extend them one of the plastic pieces snapped and the metal part is bent.</p><p>Thank you<br />Misha</p>									</div>

					<p>You have to use a knife to cut the black blob of sticky foam underneath the miniPCI card before you&#039;ll be able to lift it out (You can try just pulling really hard but it&#039;s pretty darn sticky if I remember rightly. So A) cut middle of black foam between card and main board (carefully of course), B) gently pull metal/plastic clips on side of card out to the outsides (about 0.5cm just enough so you can visually see they&#039;re not in the little half-circle shaped holes in the card anymore), C) lift card up from the back, it will go up on about a 45 degree angle, then pull out gently backwards (Kind of like that old 72pin RAM used to be back int eh 486 days).</p><p>-Rob</p>									</div>
