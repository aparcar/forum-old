					<p>Nbd and Mr-Packet got OpenWrt working on the WRT54G3G. When you download the White Russian SVN branch and build it you have images for it.

					<p>I recently purchased one of these Linksys 3G units and was displeased to learn that my intended use is not currently supported by the stock firmware. I intended to use the router with my Verizon EVDO service, assuming that the router was not locked to a Vodafone card. However, if someone is able to get the cardbus working with the OpenWRT firmware, would I be wrong in assuming that the Novatel Merlin v620 card used for my Verizon EVDO account would have a good shot at working?</p><p>Also, the specifications for this unit are nowhere to be found, specifically the amount of RAM and the type of processor. I would assume these specs are similar if not slightly better than the other WRT routers offered by Linksys, but it would be nice to know what can be expected in terms of ability to flash a good sized firmware to the device.</p><p>Thanks folks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi everybody,<br />if it&#039;s possible to get the UMTS card to work, would it be possible to dial into the router directly using a notebook with an UMTS card? The scenario here would be an offsite engineer dialing into the router directly using UMTS and Windows dial-up to access to remote network and the router for troubleshooting. This would require the router to 1) have a phone number 2) accept the UMTS call 3) start PPP as a network access server.<br />I think 1) is subject to the local service provider, experiences with german cellcos would be welcome! Regarding 2) I&#039;m not sure about how UMTS operates but if it works similar to PSTN / ISDN it should work. And finally 3) should work, since the PPP package should provide this functionality. So the only problem seems to be the hardware-support, or do I miss something here? </p><p>Thanks, Marcus</p>									</div>

					<p>I am also interested in the development of this feature. In specific for the OPTION globetrotter Fusion + HSDPA.</p><p>In holland t-mobile provides a flat fee unlimited data service with UMTS/GPRS/HSDPA/WLAN (making use of the card mentioned), while the competitors (vodafone and kpn) have a data limit of 1 GB. </p><p>I am not interested in the WLAN part, but UMTS/HSDPA is interesting. If the router works with the vodafone 3G card should there be any reason that other option cards would not work?</p><p>Also interesting, the wrt54g3g will also support sprint EVDO cards.</p><p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/04/05/sprint-announces-ev-do-router-and-usb-dongle/">http://www.engadget.com/2006/04/05/spri … sb-dongle/</a></p>									</div>
