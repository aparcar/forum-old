					<p>Hello to all, <br />I am new with OpenWrt and I&#039;m asked to create a new firmware for the LinkIt Smart 7688 Duo, with an application that will start as soon as the boot is done, my application has to be integrated to the firmware before the build, Plus I have a deadline for submitting the application, I&#039;m new at this so I don&#039;t know how to do it.&nbsp; Anyone can guide me through the process Please ??</p>									</div>

					<p>From the tone of your message, it looks like you are in a rush because you have been hired to do some paid consultancy that you cannot fulfill. And, if your application is not open source, then you probably have been asked to perform a task in violation of the GNU license. Plus everything you need to know is just a couple of google searches away.</p><p>These kind of help requests do not tend to be liked very much around here...</p>									</div>

					<p>When you install an application, it becomes part of the file system thus it is ready to run right after boot.&nbsp; Scripts in /etc/init.d are usually used to automatically launch applications during boot.</p><p>You can use Image Builder or other binary tools to pack your application into the root image, so the whole firmware is one file.&nbsp; But as eduperez said, if you want to distribute that file you have to follow GPL rules.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 15 May 2017, 19:28)</p>

					<p>That is not going to make something start automatically at boot.&nbsp; </p><p>You need to write an init script to start it.&nbsp; Suggest examining a simple daemon type application like gpsd as an example.</p>									</div>

					<p>My two cents:<br /></p><ul><li><p>You already have an application developed and tested.</p></li><li><p>Install it into your device, and configure it to start your app on boot; follow mk24&#039;s advice, and have a look at &quot;<a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/process.boot">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/process.boot</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/initscripts">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/initscripts</a>&quot;.</p></li><li><p>You also seem capable of building your own firmware, now test it.</p></li><li><p>Finally, follow the instructions at &quot;<a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build#custom_files">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build#custom_files</a>&quot; to add your custom files to the build.</p></li></ul>									</div>
