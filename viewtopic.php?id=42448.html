					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;m a bit of an OpenWrt newbie and i&#039;m trying to set up a new network.</p><p>I basically want to split a router into 2 separate networks. One for my home office and one for the rest of the family to use.</p><p>I have an TP-Link TL-WR1043N running OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment 12.09-beta2.</p><p>The WAN port is connected to my upstream provider.</p><p>I want to physically split the network into 2.</p><p>Ports 1 and 2 of the device should be on the 192.168.10.x range with DHCP enabled. I want to take these ports to my office, plug into a dumb hub and share the network around the office.</p><p>Ports 3 and 4 of the device should be on the 192.168.100.x range with DHCP enabled. I want to take these ports to the house, into a dumb hub and share them with the family.</p><p>Can this be done on the WR1043N?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Different router but running Backfire. You can make them see each other by bouncing through NAT. I do that for my LAN network attached printer so the Guest WIFI, which normally only sees the Internet can get to my printer.</p><p>HTH</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi DB1,</p><p>Many thanks!</p><p>Based on your information, it shows that you are using iptables command to tell router to route the traffic to the desired vlans. Where did you put your iptables commands? In the Custom Rules (/etc/firewall.user)? Or in /etc/config/firewall?</p><p>Have you tried to put those iptables command in router via Web-GUI LuCI?</p><p>YH</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>yhfung</strong> on 24 Feb 2013, 14:26)</p>

					<p>firewall.user - Which trashes *all* the supplied set up and builds the lot from scratch. I have used iptables before on a Solaris box I used to use as a firewall years ago and feel more comfortable with that method - I just could not get my head around all the zones etc/ set by default. It&#039;s OK as long as you don&#039;t go anywhere near the firewall set up in the GUI although the rule status display is safe. Actually I take it one stage more. I also keep a copy as /etc/firewall.sh. This is the one I play with - just needs a ./firewall.sh to run - If I totally screw it and lock my self out a reboot gets the previous version. Once I am happy with the changes I copy it to firewall.user.</p><p>In the process I found out that the GUI backup must have a list of files to copy as firewall.sh never appears in the backups. I guess there are settings in /etc that would screw a f/w update if restored from a previous version.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi DB1ï¼Œ</p><p>Thank you very much for your advice. </p><p>Openwrt uses its own way to set up the firewall although it still accepts firewall command&nbsp; such as iptables.</p><p>Once I issued the command &quot;iptables -L&quot;, the output puzzled me very much because I am not familiar with the OpenWRT&#039;s presentation method for the firewall.</p><br /><p>YH</p>									</div>
