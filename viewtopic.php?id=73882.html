					<p>Hi,<br />I&#039;m using GoldenOrb_ Build 2017-12-15. Their forum is apparently a one for everything thread, and so I did not post there. Maybe I should.</p><p>Anyway, the problem is, that I&#039;d like to know if logging into OpenWrt via dropbear does utilize the processor of the router. For the time you wait, it might take something like 50% of it&#039;s processing power, right?<br />I let a server log into the router every 10 seconds to retrieve the external IP and I&#039;m somehow concerned that I could generate hick-ups by this.<br />Dropbear apparently does or does not make use of the processor in these 3 seconds. It could wait for the reverse DNS, which seems to be compiled into OpenWRT with the DO_HOST_LOOKUP. Or it could sleep. Seems a bit hard to test. If it does wait for DNS or sleep, it should be no problem.</p><p>But it could also take 3 seconds to sign a host key or something (the router has a 400 MHz Atheros processor), and it would be no good idea to log in every 10 seconds maybe. I just don&#039;t want to make my router get slower than my internet connection. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>If anyone knows what dropbear does there, that would be good to know.<br />(Or if you know a method to instantly get the external WAN/modem IP. Just letting the server connect to a &quot;icanhazip&quot; service might stop working.)</p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>orby</strong> on 19 Apr 2018, 14:36)</p>
