					<p>I have one of these routers, which I managed to brick while performing a Belkin firmware update some time ago.&nbsp; I got a USB RS232-TTL cable, hooked it up, and used tftp to load openwrt-rdc-squashfs-ar525w.img (from Kamakazi 8.09.2) to it.&nbsp; It now boots up, and I can access the device via telnet or httpd, which is a marked improvement over its previous bricked state.&nbsp; I can set config changes, such as essid (and changed root password), but I don&#039;t _see_ the wifi AP at all, and I see nothing to indicate that the essid should be non-broadcast.</p><p>The device sports an RDC R3211-G chip.&nbsp; The board is silk-screened with WRTR-159G_V01 (bits of information offered for others who may be searching on these bits of information).</p><p>During boot, I note an abundance of JFFS2 errors relating to expected signatures, along the lines of:</p><p>jffs2_scan_eraseblock(): Magic bitmask 0x1985 not found at 0x001c0024: 0x7372 instead</p><p>every 20 or so are followed by:</p><p>Further such events for this erase block will not be printed</p><p>Do I need to perform a jffs2 init of some sort?&nbsp; The &quot;magic bitmask&quot; errors absolutely flood the dmesg, rendering it useless once the device is booted.</p><p>I don&#039;t know the significance of them, but the following two files are standouts in /tmp:</p><p>-rwx------&nbsp; &nbsp; 1 root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 Aug&nbsp; 7 04:02 .failsafe<br/>-rwx------&nbsp; &nbsp; 1 root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5 Aug&nbsp; 7 04:03 .switch2jffs</p><p>root@OpenWrt:/# cat /tmp/.switch2jffs<br/>1274</p><p>I presume that 1274 might be a pid, though there&#039;s no current pid matching that.</p><p>I tried the equivalent image from backfire (10.03, then 10.03.1 rc5), but after flashing the router (again, via tftp), the console just sits there after reporting kernel and firmware image sizes.&nbsp; The device doesn&#039;t respond to pings, and after sitting for 10 minutes waiting to see if it might come up (not knowing if say, the kernel isn&#039;t outputting messages during initialization), I&#039;m left expecting that the 10.03.1 rc5 is still NFG. -- I got it that there was some issue with 10.03.</p><p>flashing with the current trunk snapshot, got me much the same:</p><p># Kernel size = 803072 bytes<br/># FW size = 2097156 bytes</p><p># fwcheck: base = 0x00400000, size = 0x00000400<br/># Firmware Checksum O.K<br/># Kernel copying......BEGIN<br/># Kernel copying......FINISH</p><p>mem_size: 1000000</p><p>(then it just SITS there)</p><p>I returned to the 8.09.2 image, which after reset shows a banner similar to above, and immediately after the memory size, reports &quot;Uncompressing Linux&quot;, and away it goes -- still reporting the jffs2 errors as indicated above.</p><p>If I execute &#039;mount&#039; on the booted router, I get:</p><p>rootfs on / type rootfs (rw)<br/>/dev/root on /rom type squashfs (ro)<br/>proc on /proc type proc (rw)<br/>sysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw)<br/>tmpfs on /tmp type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev)<br/>tmpfs on /dev type tmpfs (rw)<br/>devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw)<br/>mini_fo:/tmp/root on / type mini_fo (rw)</p><p>I was surprised to find the following in /etc/fstab (obviously not found and mounted):</p><p># WARNING: this is an auto generated file, please use uci to set static filesystems<br/>/dev/sda1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/home&nbsp; &nbsp;ext3&nbsp; &nbsp; noauto,rw,sync&nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0</p><br/><p>Sadly, there&#039;s not much discussion here about this router - </p><p>This poor chap didn&#039;t gather ANY replies:<br/><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=19582">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=19582</a></p><p>This thread offers up someone&#039;s success with the same revision router (and pointed me to the firmware image to utilize myself), but lacks any confirmation that they got wifi operational:<br/><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=19021">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=19021</a></p><br/><p>So, basically, I have a wifi router, but no wifi presence.&nbsp; Clearly, the firmware can communicate with the wifi hardware successfully, as via the http Network&gt;wifi menu, I can [scan] and see other wifi networks that are present.&nbsp; Yes, the device is configured as an AP, not a client or something else.</p><p>Yes, I have tried to connect to the device using the essid on the assumption that it might be up but simply not broadcasting.&nbsp; No luck.</p><p>I do not have any other OpenWRT routers - though I do have a USR which I loaded DD-WRT onto.</p><p>Note - if I flash the OEM firmware to the device, it comes up, even sees its original configuration data (from before it bricked - must have been undisrupted in NVRAM), and the wifi is functional, so I know the device is good.</p><p>Help!</p>									</div>
