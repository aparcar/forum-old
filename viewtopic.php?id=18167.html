					<p>OpenWrt + WRT54G/GS is so dang cool I just about can&#039;t stand it. I have four WRT54 routers that I&#039;ve been running OpenWrt on for quite some time now and I just recently upgraded them all to 7.09. I have been running a separate DMZ vlan from nearly the beginning and have been using Shorewall as my firewall. I recently bought a new motherboard and quad core processor with a bunch of RAM on it for one of my machines and decided I wanted to start virtualizing a few of the old dedicated machines. I wanted to create guests that were to connect to separate vlans but I wanted to do it through a single physical interface on the host rather than having a separate physical interface on each vlan. Not only that but that physical interface wasn&#039;t on the same WRT that the DMZ was defined on. </p><p>No problem, all I had to do was a little port trunking and set up a couple of VLAN interfaces on the Linux kvm host along with a bridge on each of those VLAN interfaces that the VM guests can connect to. Anyway, I created some documentation of my WRT port inventory, a graphical display of the kvm host and it&#039;s interfaces and the network config files for all the WRT routers and KVM host here:</p><p><a href="http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net/redhat/vlan/">http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net/redhat/vlan/</a></p><p>A post about it on my forums:</p><p><a href="http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=2194">http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net/forums/vi â€¦ php?t=2194</a></p><p>Maybe someone can get some use out of it. Thanks OpenWrt guys!!</p>									</div>
