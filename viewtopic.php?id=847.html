					<p>Hi all,<br />have a look at the following scenario with two linksys devices, one as access point, one as wds relay:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Internet     +----+      +----+      +------+
    +--------+ AP +-))((-+WDS +-))((-+Client|
             +----+      +----+      +------+</code></pre></div><p>Internet access is granted per chillispot.</p><p>A client close enough to the AP will<br />- get an IP from the chillispot range (192.168.182.*)<br />- be presented with the chillispot login.<br /><img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>A client far away from the AP will not even obtain an IP address from chillispot.<br /><img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>Since the AP has an additional IP address 192.168.1.1 on the WLAN interface, I manually assign 192.168.1.2 to the client and--voila--can ping the AP from the client (and vice versa).<br />Hence there <em>is</em> connectivity from the client to the AP.<br />As soon as one unplugs the relay, connectivity is lost (just to prove that we&#039;ve just used the relay successfully).</p><p>Probably my understanding of wireless relaying is too rudimentary. Since I would compare a wireless relay with a switch or hub in cable-speak, I had expected the above scenario to work &quot;out of the box&quot;.<br />Apparently, I&#039;m wrong, so can anybody hint me to<br />a) why it doesn&#039;t work<br />and of course<br />b) how to make it work?&nbsp; :? </p><p>Thanks in advance,<br />Hagen</p>									</div>

					<p>I am currently having this problem as well... and see lots of people stuggling with it around the &#039;net and no solutions... through I see some people come on threads and say they&#039;re using it so I am confident it can be done.</p><p>I am actually to the point that the actual WDS link works... the chillispot router can ping the client router and vice versa, but the client router can&#039;t route to the outside world.</p><p>I figure this narrows it down to iptable rules.&nbsp; I have a couple of things to look for and I will get in there and tinker and if I find something I will post it here.&nbsp; If anyone has some ideas please, I would really like to hear &#039;em.</p><p>--davey</p>									</div>

					<p>Chillispot relies on a bridged network - I don&#039;t know if WDS meets this requirement? I don&#039;t use WDS but am facing the same issue because I&#039;d prefer not to, or can&#039;t, run bridged everywhere. I think TAP might do the trick but haven&#039;t tried it yet. The other option might be to hack chilli to ignore the mac address but this would probably reduce security.</p><p>- DL</p>									</div>
