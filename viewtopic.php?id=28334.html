					<p>Hello,</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I just installed openwrt 10.03 onto a WRT54G that I had laying around.&nbsp; Hope to use it as a firewall/router/vpn-endpoint at a remote site.&nbsp; Traditionally, for such things I have used an old PC running Slackware.&nbsp; The WRT54G will cost me less in electricity, and I won&#039;t have to go vacuum it out every six months.&nbsp; Win-win.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I am modifying my customary firewall to go on this machine.&nbsp; Like most firewalls, it consists of a series of iptables commands.<br />So far, it seems to work.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;One thing the box seems to be missing is the &quot;at&quot; command.&nbsp; When I mess with a firewall that is physically far away, I *always*<br />run a little script I call fixme:</p><p>--------- snip ------------<br />#!/bin/sh<br />at -f /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall.loose now + 5 minutes<br />--------- endsnip ---------</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;So when I do something stupid with the firewall and lock myself out of that remote machine, it fixes itself 5 minutes later.<br />rc.firewall.loose basically flushes all the tables and sets the default policies to &quot;ACCEPT&quot; - really, no firewall at all.&nbsp; It has saved<br />my behind numerous times.</p><p>&nbsp; But openwrt doesn&#039;t seem to have an &quot;at&quot; command.&nbsp; Anybody know where it is?&nbsp; &nbsp;In general, how does one look for a file in the packages?</p><p>&nbsp; Thanks in advance,</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Jerry Kaidor</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks. I know it is a really old post, but was of help to me.</p><p>The init script actually creates all the missing directories. So all I needed to do was start the init script (/etc/init.d/atd start)</p><p>Thanks,<br />GN.</p>									</div>
