					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have problem doing VLAN tagging with tags greater than 15&nbsp; on WL500gP.<br />I found that there is integrated ethernet switch based on BCM5325.<br />Is there any way to make tagging work with higher tag numbers on integrated switch?<br />I tried to do double tagging of frames to workaround this problem [I configured openwrt to untag outer tag on WAN ineterface, so it gave me just 1 time tagged frames], but it works just on transmited packets [i observed this with another computer and tcpdump]. It seems that incoming packets to eth.ports with tag &gt;15 are discarded. I didn&#039;t see any packets coming to openwrt eth interface. Is there any way to instruct BCM5325 controller to do double tagging [i need that, it will just add another tag on already tagged frames [with high VLAN numbers] incoming to WAN port]?<br />Does anyone know how to solve this?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
