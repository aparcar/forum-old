					<p>I have not found anything like data sheets or chip manuals for the various broadcom chips that make up the wrtsl54gs units I use. Are these available through any channel? Specifically, I&#039;d be more than happy to work on the USB and ethernet PHY issues if I only had some information about the underlying chips to work with.</p><p>Alternatively... is there a low power &lt; $100 unit with wifi, more than one ethernet, USB, and &gt;=32M ram that uses well documented parts? (I&#039;d switch to one of the x86 platforms and stop fighting all the hardware issues, but I need lower power.)</p>									</div>

					<p>Jim,</p><p>I&#039;m looking for similar kit myself. The best I&#039;ve managed to find that&#039;s supported by OpenWRT is the Compex NP18A (discontinued, will be replaced soon apparently by the NP18B).</p><p>The Verizon FiOS device manufactured by Actiontec looks very appealing, but that isn&#039;t yet supported by OpenWRT and doesn&#039;t meet your USB criteria.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Sam</p>									</div>
