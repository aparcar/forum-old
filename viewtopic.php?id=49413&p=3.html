					<p>Here is firmware I&#039;ve build _for myself_ some time ago. I am making this very clear because this firmware contains many packages you probably don&#039;t need and there is not so much free space left. Also, it contains updated VDSL drivers and modified connect script to test line parameters auto-detection. It works for me. If it works for you then good, if not then you are unfortunately on your own. I&#039;ve tested it with DSL firmware 5.7.4.3.0.6-5.7.1.8.0.1 (you can get instructions how to get it from Martin&#039;s repository <a href="https://xdarklight.github.io/lantiq-xdsl-firmware-info/">https://xdarklight.github.io/lantiq-xdsl-firmware-info/</a> ) FW-cutter util is striped from the image so you need to use following command to flash it to firmware partition<br />tar cvz firmware_file.bin &gt; /dev/mtd4<br />then you need to make sure that symlink to from /lib/firmware/lantiq/firmware_file.bin to /lib/firmware/vdsl.bin exists</p><p>Please note that is not the latest trunk version because for some reason it causes significant issues with wireless for me. <br />EDIT: this image in longer available. See my post below for updated version.</p><p>Please do not ask me for further support as I most likely will not be able to provide it. I am not even using this image anymore.</p><p>EDIT: This image is stripped from ATM support (ADSL). It supports PTM (VDSL) only</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>olewales</strong> on 17 Jul 2015, 05:05)</p>

					<p>Ok, wifi seems to work fine again so I&#039;ve build stock version. Only changes I&#039;ve made to standard config are add LuCI, apply Martin Blumenstingl&#039;s patch updating VDSL components to latest version and patch wifi. I did some basic tests on this image but I cannot guarantee anything.

					<p>Configuration is highly dependent on your ISP. For a start I&#039;d check system log for any obvious misconfiguration. I use VDSL so my config is quite a bit different and probably wont be much help here. Is your ISP providing you with IPv6 address? If not then you might want to set option ipv6 to &#039;0&#039;</p><p>I assume you did basic checks like making sure you are using correct path and channel parameters (VPI, VCI) for your ISP and that it is using pppoa encapsulation</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>olewales</strong> on 17 Jul 2015, 17:57)</p>

You said &quot;VCI and VPI is set to 0/38&quot;, I believe most UK ISPs have the VPI = 0 and VCI = 38, not the other way around.<br />An extra check for you.</p>									</div>

					<p>It uses the same case as WDR3600/4300/4900 models. Just wedge flat screwdriver where case parts meet on the side and retention clips should let go.

					<p>Hi everyone,<br />I think I might have bricked my modem. So when I power on the modem all I get is just this in loop:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ROM VER: 1.1.4
CFG 05

ROM VER: 1.1.4
CFG 05

ROM VER: 1.1.4
CFG 05

ROM VER: 1.1.4
CFG 05</code></pre></div><p>I think the issue was I deleted too much (instead of 0x20000 to 0x7a0000, it was 0x7a00000) and unplugged the power cable when it was still deleting.</p><p>I have followed <a href="https://github.com/jimdigriz/bratwurst/tree/master/board/lantiq/td-w8980">bratwurst&#039;s</a> guide to unbrick and flashed the image via the uart method, once I power on my modem, the same thing keeps happening.</p><p>Did I just broke my bootloader?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi all,<br />i&#039;ve compiled succesfully an image and flashed my TD-W8980 with ADSL and Wifi (2.4GHz only) working. </p><p>I&#039;ve noticed that the rootfs&#039;s size is only 4MB. After installing a pair of packets i&#039;ve no space left on device. </p><p>Flash is 8MB large, but seems to be used only 4MB.

It works with the Annex A as well as the Annex B version of the 8980.</p><p>If your broadband connection is Annex A ADSL, you&#039;re out of luck.</p><p>I own an Annex A TD-W8980, but I&#039;m living in an Annex B country. I only used the device to add support for the TD-W8980 to OpenWrt <br />(<a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/47129">r47129</a>, <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/47130">r47130</a>)</p><p>Depending on shipping costs, it might be an option that to exchange our devices.
