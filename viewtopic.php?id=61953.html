					<p>BB and CC are great but for 4MB/16MB devices they are really not that convenient to use, it would be great to have an AA release with a kernel patched for security issues discovered since..&nbsp; I believe such a thing was in the plans at some point, has it been completely sidelined or worse abandoned?</p>									</div>

					<p>If you want to make a custom build you should better use this commands<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>git clone git://git.openwrt.org/12.09/openwrt.git
