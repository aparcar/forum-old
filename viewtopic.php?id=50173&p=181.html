Linksys also uses the dual firmware thing there so you might get some mileage out of reading that source code.</p><p>That said, last time I talked to Kaloz about this (months ago) he wasn&#039;t too keen on spending time trying to work in a system that isn&#039;t all that great at preventing bricking. Getting actual source for u-boot would mean we&#039;d have the ability to chainload a custom u-boot, where you could add real recovery and do away with the dual firmware thing altogether. Such is done on some other targets (kirkwood, for example).</p><p>Other boards with u-boot have real recovery mechanisms, like a TFTP or web server you can connect to and upload a working image, rather than banking on the possibility that the second image is working.</p></blockquote></div><p>I&#039;d have to review my notes on what I was trying to do but was hampered as the WRT&#039;s u-boot version was quite a bit behind. Vague recollection I was attempting two things-- boot from an image on usb and flashing a new image from usb automatically if detected-- which would give us an additional safety against bricking. I gave up.</p><p>But I&#039;m also curious about what they&#039;ve added for the fail over stuff.</p>									</div>

					<p>I finally switched back to 3.18.11 since 4.0 presented some regression (stability, speeds, lockups, etc). It seems 3.18 has matured quite a bit and overall the router seems to be in a more usable state than where it was just a month ago. @Kaloz @mmilburn and everyone else who have helped this router get to this point, Thank You!</p>									</div>
