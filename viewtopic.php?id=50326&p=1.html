					<p>Hey everyone, let&#039;s talk about <a href="https://www.docker.io/">Docker</a>!</p><p>There&#039;s <a href="http://wiki.OpenWrt.org/doc/howto/docker_OpenWrt_image">a good wiki page about how to run OpenWrt images on Docker</a>.&nbsp; This post is about the converse situation--how to run a Docker container on an OpenWrt device.</p><p>First, what is a Docker container?&nbsp; A Docker container is a lightweight virtual machine.&nbsp; It&#039;s possible to run many Docker containers simultaneously on a low-end computer with excellent performance and low overhead.&nbsp; The promise (mostly true) is also that a Docker container can run on any Linux computer without modification.</p><p>It&#039;s the portability property that excites me about running Docker on OpenWrt because there&#039;s already <a href="https://index.docker.io/">a growing library of free Docker containers</a>.&nbsp; If we can make it possible to run a Docker container on an OpenWrt box, then we can run these containers without modification.</p><p>OpenWrt already does a fantastic job of lowering the learning curve for me to create an application on a low-end device.&nbsp; I get to use Linux and a package manager that resembles the Debian one I&#039;m used to.&nbsp; With Docker support this learning curve would go even further down to zero--to create a new application on an OpenWrt device I would just create a container the way I&#039;m already creating containers that run in VirtualBox and on Amazon EC2.&nbsp; I would have the confidence of knowing that my applications would work without having to factor the idiosyncrasies of OpenWrt into my test cases.</p><p>Of course this will probably work only on beefier OpenWrt devices, which is fine with me.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think there should be any significant technical hurdles as someone has already figured out <a href="https://www.stgraber.org/2013/12/23/lxc-1-0-some-more-advanced-container-usage/">how to run Docker containers on Android</a>.</p><p>What do you think?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>NodeGuy</strong> on 28 Apr 2014, 05:29)</p>

					<p>I don&#039;t know the answer to your question and I&#039;m not a Docker developer.</p><p>If I were to make a guess, it&#039;s that using Docker to create a build environment is genuinely the best tool for the job.&nbsp; Look at the following enthusiasm around using Docker to make Debian packages:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>I found that Docker is the best tool for developing Debian/Ubuntu packages. If you build your packages with pbuilder, then you will love Docker, because it is using the same concept, but is much more controllable, and it gives you much more freedom.</p><p>Docker uses the same concept of pbuilder, which gives you an isolated pure &amp; pristine environment to build packages. The reason that I think Docker is the best tool for developing Debian/Ubuntu packages is that, suppose you find some minor problems when building a package and you want to fix it, then pbuilder is not a good help here. Sure you can go all the nine yards building from the pure &amp; pristine environment every time you make a tiny change, but it would not be ideal, because when we do quick fixes and tests, the DRY (Do-not Repeat Yourself) principle will be more importantâ€”the rebuilds for the quick fixes and tests should not do more than a make do. I.e., only build things that need to be built, and do not waste a single second on compiling something do not need to be compiled again, let alone starting from package downloading and installing. However, when the quick fixes and tests are done, we do need the ability to backtrack all the way to test installation from a bare-minimum system. This is where Docker comes shining.</p><p>The concept of Docker is far superior than pbuilder in that, it allows you to build layers on top of each other, while giving you the freedom to play in any layer at any given time. The best part is that you can discard your changes you made to the layer at your will. So that you can always go back to the pristine stage of your layer and start over again.</p></blockquote></div><p> -- <a href="http://sfxpt.wordpress.com/2013/11/10/debianubuntu-package-developing-with-docker/">Debian/Ubuntu Package Developing with Docker</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Perhaps, you don&#039;t understand my point. In your OP, you mentioned that <em>docker container is a lightweight virtual machine</em> and <em>it&#039;s possible to run many docker containers simultaneously on a low-end computer with excellent performance and low overhead</em>. If that is true, then docker will probably be an excellent program to port to OpenWRT. That&#039;s what I tried to do. However, unless I can (cross) compile the docker source using OpenWRT toolchain, there is no way I can port it to OpenWRT. I lurked around the docker site and found no mentions on how to compile the docker source. This bring me to question whether the real docker source code is an open-source. What I meant is I suspect the current open and downloadable source isn&#039;t really the docker main source, but rather some sort of docker files that can only be compiled by the docker tools into containers.</p>									</div>

In this OpenWRT environment, you can run an OpenWRT firmware. If that is the case, then can you at least create a virtual OpenWRT environment for an ARMv5 platform. Then, go to <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/kirkwood">OpenWRT snapshot trunk for kirkwood</a> to download and extract both the <em>openwrt-kirkwood-generic-rootfs.tar.gz</em> and <em>openwrt-kirkwood-uImage</em> files to the virtual OpenWRT environment. Once you have done that, try to see if you can let the virtual OpenWRT environment to run the firmware. BTW, the <em>openwrt-kirkwood-uImage</em> file must reside inside the /boot directory.</p><p>If the above test works, then at least there is something we can do with docker.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes and I am aware of that. But, that is for the openwrt-x86 platform and I am looking for a possibility to run ANY OpenWRT in a docker! From what I saw, that is not possible unless docker GPLs its source code or at least provide the environment to support all platforms supported by OpenWRT. Eventually, I would like to run docker on any OpenWRT since you mentioned in your OP that <em>It&#039;s possible to run many Docker containers simultaneously on a low-end computer with excellent performance and low overhead</em>.
