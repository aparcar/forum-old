					<p>I have successfully got 8.09RC1 setup and working on my WGT634U Netgear router. Now I am trying to configure some standard DHCP and DNS setting via LuCI that I cannot seem to understand how to input and configure. I am hoping that some in the community that are also playing with the new release may understand how to configure these.</p><p><strong>DNS:</strong><br />1. Like many people, I use openDNS for the DNS routing on my network. However, I cannot understand how to input the the IP addresses for this service into the LuCi interface. When I go to <em>Network:Interfaces:LAN</em> I can add a line for DNS servers. I did this, and can add the Ip address for one of the two OpenDNS servers, but not both. It will not allow both the be entered in the text box separated by either a comma or space. <br />For now I have one of the two OpenDNS addresses entered on that line. However, when I do a standard C:\ipconfig /all&nbsp; the windows machine shows the DNS server as 192.168.1.1.</p><p>Is this the correct place to be entering the DNS servers, and how can I enter both IP addresses?</p><p><strong>DHCP:</strong><br />2. Related to the above question, how to I get DHCP to serve DNS server addresses to the individual machines? <br />As I mentioned above, after a standard install of 8.09RC1 and configuring the PPoE settings,&nbsp; all machines connected to the router report their DNS server as 192.168.1.1. How can I get DHCP to give the connected machines the external IP&#039;s of the DNS servers along with their IP addresses?</p><p><strong>Local Workgroup</strong><br />3. How can I get my router to be in the workgroup domain instead of LAN? Most routers now days are set to workgroup by default and it would make integrating the new router into the existing network easier. Is this the local domain under <em>Services:DnsMasq</em>? If so then changing the domain to workgroup and the Server to /workgroup should be the answer, correct? </p><p><strong>Port Forwarding:</strong><br />4. Is there a page to set-up port forwarding for things like Irc and Bittorrent? I cannot seem to find a place to do this. Perhaps I have to create a route to the machine I want to use the port with under <em>Network:Routes</em>?</p><p><strong>And A few misc. question:</strong><br />5. Does LuCI have a page to see all connected devices, or do we have to depend on <em>Network:Active Connections</em> and memorize what computer is each IP address?</p><p>6. Is there any guide or post concerning IPv6? I would love to have a limited implementation of it for the Vista machines connected, but want to understand it better first. I tried searching the Wiki and the Forum and found very little. Fow example, in <em>Network:Interfaces:LAN</em> I can set an IPv6 gateway and address. Would I be correct to assume that the address I can set is the router to give it an IPv6 address that could be typed into an address bar to reach the router as well? I didn&#039;t see anything in DHCP for assigning IPv6 address. I guess I&#039;ll leave IPv6 for a separate post...</p>									</div>

I had already read much of the MAN pages for DNSMASQ.<br />What I was looking for is information on how to do these things in the GUI of LuCI.</p><p>2. I could do the following from the command line:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dhcp-option=6,x.x.x.x,y.y.y.y

x.x.x.x = DNS1
y.y.y.y = DNS2</code></pre></div><p>but I was looking for something graphical in LuCI.<br />This strikes me as something that will confuse novice users since most standard routers pass the DNS information to the machines instead of doing all resolution themselves. A new user might be confused when running C:\ipconfig /all and seeing that the DNS server is set to 192.168.1.1</p><p>3. Thank for point that out. That&#039;s a serious misunderstanding on my part. You learn something new everyday! That being said, how would I set the router to be part of a windows workgroup? Is this done in Samba? I have installed the LuCI Samba package, and would like to learn more about configuring it, but there is little information available so far for the LuCI GUI based apps.</p><p>4. Again I was looking for something GUI based. I would think that standard user new to OpenWRT and using LuCI in 8.09 would want to set up a few ports to forward for Torrents, IRC, Netflix movie player, etc. Is there a way to do this in LuCI?</p><p>5. It would be great to see a page in LuCI showing a table of machine connected (NetBIOS Name), IP Address, and MAC Address.&nbsp; Does such a thing exist in LuCI?</p>									</div>
