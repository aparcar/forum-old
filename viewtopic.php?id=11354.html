					<p>Hi, </p><p>today I had the bad idea to update my kamikaze install. No idea what exactly wen wrong..</p><p>- compiled kamikaze and flashed via mtd (OK)<br />- telnet to it (OK)<br />- passwd and ssh to it (OK, sort of.. shell was very slow, and i had to reconnect 3 times)<br />- started copying back configs from previous install via NFS. Boom!</p><p>the the shell somewhat locked up, I also wasn&#039;t able to connect to a new one, because it hang after typing password. I thought okay, maybe a reboot helps. but it never came up again.</p><p>Failsafe mode does not seem to exist yet on kamikaze, at least nothing happened after holding reset for 2 secs after DMZ light.</p><p>So, boot_wait is still enabled from whiterussion (I hope) and I wanted to reflash it using TFTP, but somehow I cannot even ping the router. </p><p>Is there something I can check to get TFTP running? </p><br /><p>Or is it just totally bricked and next step is JTAG method? (Geee, no idea of soldering... only one guy from canada selling cables on ebay..)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gimpel</strong> on 24 Jun 2007, 22:14)</p>
