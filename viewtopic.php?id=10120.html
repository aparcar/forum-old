					<p>Ok, this is probably a stupid question, but I finally got my freshly compiled image booting on my La Fonera. Everything went fine until it started processing the modules, when it complained that awk and sed were nowhere to be found. (The image is booting just fine)</p><p>So, I went back to &#039;make menuconfig&#039;, and there is absolutely no mention of these utilities that I could find (I thought they might have been in busybox, but I didn&#039;t see them). I also didn&#039;t see any packages for them in &#039;packages&#039;</p><p>I did a svn update this morning, and my build tree is at revision 6754.</p><p>Everything else seems to be working, but I haven&#039;t really had a chance to play with the install much.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
