					<p>I&#039;m having a strange issue I&#039;m hoping someone can help me with.&nbsp; I&#039;m having a problem which I think boils down to bridging between the wifi and ethernet links. First my network layout.&nbsp; Both WRT54G&#039;s are using kamikaze 8.09 RC1.</p><p>Internet &lt;-wire-&gt; WRT54G (gateway) &lt;-wifi-&gt; WRT54G (client) &lt;-wire-&gt; AppleTV</p><p>I also have:</p><p>Airport Extreme (wireless N only) &lt;-wire-&gt; WRT54G (client) &lt;-wire-&gt; AppleTV</p><p>That is, my gateway machine shares my internet over 802.11g, to which my client is connected using client mode in order to give my media center access to the internet.&nbsp; I also have a airport extreme configured as wireless-n only (set to bridge ports) to give high speed access to my media center as thats where I usually need it for transferring video files.</p><p>I have iTunes on my laptop set to sync with my AppleTV.&nbsp; From what I gather, communication between the two happen using Bonjour for discovery (UDP 5353) and TCP port 3689 for syncing.</p><p>When I connect my laptop to the Airport Extreme, I have no problem seeing or syncing with my appletv.&nbsp; When I connect my laptop to the gateway, I&#039;ll occasionally be able to see/sync to the appletv, but the connection stops working pretty quickly.</p><br /><p>Some things I tried:</p><p>&quot;iptables -F&quot; on both gateway and client, didn&#039;t work.<br />Connecting laptop directly to client (ethernet cable and/or wifi by setting client as an access point) worked</p><p>Any ideas how I can debug this further or even things to try for fixing this?</p><p>Note that staying connected to airport extreme isn&#039;t an option as its actually my wife&#039;s laptop that needs to sync to the appletv, and she only has 802.11g, and I&#039;d prefer not to enable g on it as this slows down my n-network.</p>									</div>

					<p>I forgot to mention that when client is setup for client mode, I set it to static ip=192.168.1.2, mask=255.255.255.0, gateway=192.168.1.1<br />The gateway machine has static ip=192.168.1.1,mask-255.255.255.0,gateway=&lt;blank&gt;</p><p>When things are failing, I am able to &quot;telnet appletv 3689&quot; ok, but haven&#039;t figured out how to check the udp port, so I&#039;m guessing its the culprit (does wifi&lt;-&gt;wired bridging transmit udp? udp broadcasts?)</p>									</div>

					<p>With madwifi drivers (atheros wireless), bridging the client wireless interface is definitly not possible/working, but a wds solution with wpa2-psk is working fine with two foneras.<br /><a href="http://madwifi-project.org/wiki/UserDocs/WirelessBridging">http://madwifi-project.org/wiki/UserDoc … ssBridging</a><br />I think, broadcom wireless will have similar limitations.</p>									</div>

					<p>The proprietary broadcom driver has a &quot;WET&quot; (=wireless ethernet) mode which should allow bridging in client mode. The 2.6 one does not has this feature anymore.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, I tried setting &quot;option mode wet&quot; (I&#039;m using kernel 2.4), but that didn&#039;t work.&nbsp; Reading the wiki ( <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/KamikazeConfiguration">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Kam … figuration</a> ), it says:</p><p>4) &quot;option mode&quot;: there is no &#039;wet&#039; mode any more. However, if you select &#039;sta&#039; mode, and also bridge the wireless to another interface (e.g. &#039;option network lan&#039;), then wet mode is enabled automatically. This allows the unit to act as a wireless bridge, so that one or more PCs sitting behind the OpenWrt box can join the LAN. Some ARP and DHCP masquerading is done so that this doesn&#039;t require WDS mode on the access point. (Tested with Kamikaze 7.07 and a Broadcom chipset and 2.4 kernel; may not work for Atheros and/or 2.6 users)</p><p>So I guess wds is my only option (using 8.09RC1, 2.4 kernel, wrt54gv2) unless someone has something else for me to try.<br />Unfortunately&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t able to get it to work reliably with WPA <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, I ended up switching to dd-wrt because I couldn&#039;t get WDS working well on openwrt, and dd-wrt just worked easily out of the box.<br />The good news is that using WDS has completely fixed my problem.&nbsp; Note that I tried the client bridge on dd-wrt first, and that was broken in the same way, so this leads me to believe that the only way to get a completely reliable and transparent bridge is to use WDS.</p>									</div>
