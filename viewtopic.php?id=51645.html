					<p>Hi all,<br />recently I&#039;ve purchased a tp-link mr3020 router - a version<br />with AR9331-AL1A chipset without serial pins<br />perhaps v1.8 or v1.9 according to openwrt documentation page.<br />(factory firmware was upgraded to version 3.17.2)</p><p>I was trying to install 12.09 openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-mr3020-v1-squashfs-factory.bin<br />via WebGUI following openwrt documentation. However, the standard procedure ends with an error:</p><p>Error code: 18005<br />Upgrade unsuccessfully because the version of the upgraded file was incorrect. Please check the file name.</p><p>Is there any solution for this error? (I have tried some non-working recommendations e.g. renaming the openwrt file<br />to tp-link firmware file ... )</p><p>thanks in advance<br />A.</p>									</div>

					<p>I believe this is the same issue with the 703n. TP-Link updated their firmware and now it&#039;s not possible to load OpenWRT.</p><p>My recommendation would be to contact TP-Link support and complain about the issue and ask if it&#039;s possible to downgrade the firmware that doesn&#039;t have this issue (not possible, but request it).</p>									</div>

					<p>well, first thing, flashing is NOT that simple, there are headers checksums and so on in the image file, and depending on the firmware some parts of the image are NOT copied in flash, some others yes.</p><p>so, you always have to use the SUITABLE firmware image with the appropriate flashing method.</p><p>from dd-wrt web gui you can ONLY use images that are build for that, so dd-wrt webflash images, or dd-wrt webrevert images. NOT openwrt factory image, NOT sysupgrade, NOT tp-link images (with or w/o uboot....).</p><p>i do not know why openwrt factory image was not accepted by tp-link GUI, sometimes you have to rename it to something short, sometimes you have to use Internet Explorer, sometimes try a different O.S, and so on...</p><p>now, flashing tp-link firmware over dd-wrt to &quot;revert&quot; to stock could be difficult, try to search the dd-wrt forum for the SPECIFIC webrevert image for your router model AND VERSION.</p>									</div>

					<p>thanks for comment nebbia88</p><p>I&#039;ve reflashed factory firmware 3.12.11 (using dd-wrt webrevert image)<br />and I have flashed BARRIER BREAKER (14.07-rc1, r41580)<br />It went smootly without 18005 error. It seems everything works fine.</p><p>Attitude adjustment 12.09 was impossible to flash - following<br />suggestions - I have tried renaming, other browser (even IE -<br />it was quite difficult to find <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> but always with 18005 error.</p><p>A.</p>									</div>
