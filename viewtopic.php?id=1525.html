					<p>After hours upon hours of trying to get the router to accept 2 ip addressess.&nbsp; Recently found out that aliases and dhcp don&#039;t mix.&nbsp; I decided to take a different approach.&nbsp; I will do my best to explain what I am trying to do.&nbsp; I want to be able to connect port 1 to port 0 (wan port) in a true switch fasion, while leaving the other ports behind the lan.&nbsp; I have added port 1 to vlan1 to no avail.&nbsp; I also tried just removing it completely, which also did not work.&nbsp; If the router is just a switch this should be possible, but the vlans give me a headache.&nbsp; Including some ascii art to reiterate what I am trying to accomplish.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;modem &lt;----&gt; router &lt;---- port 1 -----&gt;public ip<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; |&nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; |&nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; private ips<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /&nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp;\<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; port2&nbsp; &nbsp;port3&nbsp; &nbsp; port4</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t think that is what I want to do.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want port 1 to talk to the router at all but to be connected to the internet directly through the wan port.&nbsp; I want port 1 to act as though it were connected to a switch in front of the router.&nbsp; Is this even possible.&nbsp; From what I can tell the switch is configured by the et driver.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t been able to find any info on how I might be able to use it to configure the switch to do what I want.</p><p>And yes, it is a wrt54g V2.2.&nbsp; My isp allocates 3 dynamically assigned ip addresses.&nbsp; I want to use two of them, but I do not want to have to connect a separate switch in front of the router if it can be avoided.&nbsp; It seems to me that this would be trivial, but maybe it is beyond the capabilities of the hardware/drivers.</p><br /><p>Perhaps now that I have that port independant of the bridge, I could figure out how to tell iptables not to nat it and somehow get it to forward broadcast messages from it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jon</strong> on 17 May 2005, 07:04)</p>

					<p>That is the ultimate goal...to allow the remote dhcp server to assign ip addresses even to a computer connected by wifi.&nbsp; What I have currently is just with one wired computer connected to port 1, which has been moved to vlan1.&nbsp; I think it shouldn&#039;t see local network traffic because if it&#039;s acting as a switch, then the packets from the wan interfaces should never escape the hardware switch chip in the router...unless I&#039;m confused.</p>									</div>
