					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>My G624T now runs OpenWRT (compiled from trunk) and is on the internet, but I have a few questions before I&#039;m done here.</p><p>1) The wireless works, and I&#039;m able to connect the craptop to the network via wireless. But it&#039;s open and I want to encrypt it, but it stays open regardless of how I change the /etc/config/wireless file. What&#039;s the simplest way of getting this done?</p><p>2) I&#039;m sure is a firewall wired/wireless bridging thing, but I can&#039;t ping (and more importantly ssh) the desktop(wired) from the craptop(wireless). The name gets resolved to the IP address, but no connection can be made. I thought I had taken down the firewall and it was still doing it, but maybe I hadn&#039;t got the firewall down. Any tips how to proceed?</p><p>3) Space! Almost any extra package I try and install, I get a message that there is X blocks needed and only Y blocks available. I&#039;m not sure if there is any thing I can do with the mtd partitioning because it looks like /tmp and /jffs are mostly free. What about a NAS? I&#039;m wondering about getting some kind of cheap network USB hub then attaching one of the big externals and maybe a USB stick. Could I mount those to provide more space to install packages? The ideal is to get this setup to do large downloads, maybe host a personal website. Speed isn&#039;t too important here, I figure even with modest spec, with enough storage it can do the job even if slowly. When I&#039;m there, it will be just a router for the desktop/laptop, but when I&#039;m not it can take over some of the work and bring down the power requirements involved (maybe even allow me to wake and connect to the desktop remotely). ;-)</p><br /><p>Thanks for any tips.</p><br /><p>Joe</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi anyone interested.</p><p>Solved 2) as well. Turns out bridging between wired and wireless is a bad idea for routing, and I read someone say it&#039;s not part of the 802 standard. So I put the wireless interface and wired interface on different IP subnets. Still no change, but if I disabled the firewall, I could then ping and ssh between the two. So I then add forwarding between the two networks to my firewall rules (/etc/config/firewall) and it worked with firewall enabled too.</p><p>So now, it&#039;s just 3), find a way of getting enough space to expand the openwrt router to host a website and do downloads. :-)</p><p>Joe</p>									</div>
