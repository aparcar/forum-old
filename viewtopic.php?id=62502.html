					<p>hello all,<br />I am using openwrt buildroot to build custom firmware for my router.Now while doing random digging,I found that the size of the squashfs image of the rootfs is about 15.1 MB while the sysupgrade image is only 13.1MB in my case.As far as I know,sysupgrade image contains both rootfs and uImage so how is it smaller than the squashfs image? is it going through some sort of compression? which command is it running?</p><p>Thanks in advance <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>factory is usually padded by zeroes to fill the whole &#039;firmware&#039; mtd (flash size minus u-boot, u-boot environment, calibration data other vendor provided mtds that shouldn&#039;t be overwritten), while sysupgrade has a closer relation to the actual firmware size (and it doesn&#039;t need to be flashable by the vendor firmware upgrade mechanism).</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your reply. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />I am actually trying to know how this sysupgrade image is generated</p>									</div>

					<p>Typically the only difference between sysupgrade and factory images is an extra OEM ID header and (for some routers) a padding of the factory image, so that the OEM firmware&#039;s verification algorithm will accept it initially. From Openwrt functional point they are usually quite identical.</p><p>Factory = sysupgrade image + OEM header + padding if required by OEM flashing routine</p><p>The sysupgrade and factory images preparation steps depend quite closely on the router model. There is no general rule. You have to check your router platform&#039;s &quot;Image&quot; Makefile for explanations.</p><p>For example, my WNDR3700&#039;s (ar71xx platform) steps are shown below:<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/target/linux/ar71xx/image/Makefile#L217">https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/t â€¦ efile#L217</a><br />Image compilation step definitions:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>IMAGES := sysupgrade.bin factory.img factory-NA.img
KERNEL := kernel-bin | patch-cmdline | lzma -d20 | netgear-uImage lzma
IMAGE/default = append-kernel $$$$(BLOCKSIZE) | netgear-squashfs | append-rootfs | pad-rootfs
IMAGE/sysupgrade.bin = $$(IMAGE/default) | check-size $$$$(IMAGE_SIZE)
IMAGE/factory.img = $$(IMAGE/default) | netgear-dni | check-size $$$$(IMAGE_SIZE)
IMAGE/factory-NA.img = $$(IMAGE/default) | netgear-dni NA | check-size $$$$(IMAGE_SIZE)</code></pre></div><p>The rather complex function calls are defined above in the same file. And outside tools are needed for several steps etc. So delving into the image generation of your device requires quite a lot of work.</p>									</div>
