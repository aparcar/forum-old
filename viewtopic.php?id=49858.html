					<p>I have two wireless cards in my x86 based machine. One is a <a href="http://www.compex.com.sg/productdetailinfo.asp?model=WLE350NX&amp;acc1Panel=1">Compex WLE350NX</a> (ath9k) 802.11a/b/g/n 2/5Ghz, well known to be supported, while the other is a <a href="http://www.zcomax.co.uk/products/index.php/products/wlan-module/802-11ac-minipci-e-module">Z-com AC-920</a> (ath10k). These are both plugged into a <a href="http://routerboard.com/RB14e">Mikrotik RB14e</a> mini PCI-e to PCI-e adapter.</p><p>Both these cards are recognized and can be configured. The WLE350NX is in the US regulatory domain and the ZCom AC-920 is in the AM regulatory domain.</p><p>Both these cards have very low txpower and nothing I do can change them. Issuing an &quot;iwconfig wlan1 txpower 20&quot; has no effect at all. It completes the command without error, but the txpower remains the same. </p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>root@OpenWrt:~# iwconfig wlan0<br />wlan0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;IEEE 802.11an&nbsp; Mode:Master&nbsp; Tx-Power=0 dBm<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RTS thr:off&nbsp; &nbsp;Fragment thr:off<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Power Management:off</p><p>root@OpenWrt:~# iwconfig wlan1<br />wlan1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;IEEE 802.11abgn&nbsp; Mode:Master&nbsp; Tx-Power=5 dBm<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RTS thr:off&nbsp; &nbsp;Fragment thr:off<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Power Management:off</p></blockquote></div><p>When booting the same machine off Ubuntu 13.10 or Fedora 17, both these cards have much higher txpower: 27dbm for the Compex and 18dbm for the ZCom.</p><p>Is there something different about the way openwrt handles the ath9k and ath10k cards that I&#039;m missing? I assume there must be since both Ubuntu and Fedora don&#039;t seem to have this problem.</p>									</div>
