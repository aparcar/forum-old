					<p>For about two weeks I&#039;ve been kicking around if I should post this or not, but since the topic has already come up in <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=10519&amp;p=2">this thread</a> I decided that this thread might be appropriate.&nbsp; So...</p><p>Myself and others have a good deal of time and effort invested in getting WhiteRussian working, and with Kamikaze approaching Milestone 1 (based on the small number of open bugs tied to that release), I know that there will be many folks wanting to upgrade from the various RC versions of WhiteRussian.&nbsp; What is needed at this point is some sort of guide to assist in the transition, how to make basic services work, moving settings and scripts to the new firmware, how things differ under Kamikaze, etc.&nbsp; One thing I understand has changed a bit is how iptables are handled (based on <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/1327">this bug</a>), and I&#039;m sure there&#039;s plenty else that&#039;s different.</p><br /><p>An incredibly helpful thing I can suggest right away is a web based directory listing of the files and folders, so that someone could click on etc, then open init.d, and then view the contents of the various files.&nbsp; This could go a long way in helping folks know what&#039;s under the hood and what might need to be done to adapt existing setups, for those that don&#039;t have a spare router to work with.</p><p>I&#039;m not asking the developers to spend time on this, their energy is best spent on the code, but I know that a lot of folks are running Kamikaze now and I&#039;m sure that a few could take a stab at getting some docs in the wiki to help the rest of us make the transition.</p>									</div>

					<p>Can anyone recommend a snapshot of kamikaze that&#039;s at least semi-stable (aka. has been known to install cleanly without bricking the router at least once) on the WRT v. 2.2? I need to reflash my router soon, and since mbm recently urged users to drop whiterussian, I thought I&#039;d take a stab at kamikaze for the first time..</p>									</div>

					<p><strong>mbm</strong>, I did not intend to insult you in any way!<br />I&#039;m asking this because I was reading that the <strong>Kamikaze</strong> (with v2.6 kernel) was not supporting the Broadcom&#039;s chipsets...<br />Was I misunderstanding something?</p><p>(I need the WPA2-Enterprize protection to work)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>booBot</strong> on 12 May 2007, 23:54)</p>
