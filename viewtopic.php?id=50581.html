					<p>I have a rosewill rns-360rt Wireless N router that seems to be compatible to the wr941ND series of TP link router.&nbsp; when I attempt to upgrade to from factory to backfire, I get an 18005 error.&nbsp; I was wonder if anyone had a workaround for <br />an upgrade similar to the rnx-150rt, or am I just out of luck. Any helpful input will be welcome .</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
