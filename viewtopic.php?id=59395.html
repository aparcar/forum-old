					<p>Hello OpenWrt community, </p><p>Thanks to your help I&#039;ve been able to setup a client bridge with my Buffalo whr-600.&nbsp; I wanted to setup openvpn on this device as well, but I&#039;m wondering if anyone can give me a tip on where/which interface the openVPN service needs to connect to in order for my clients to connect.</p><p>Here&#039;s my current setup</p><p>Main Router (DHCP/AP - 192.168.1.1) ---&gt; </p><p>OpenWrt Router - wireless client bridge.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Interfaces so far:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LAN (10.10.2.1)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wireless Client Bridge (192.168.1.5)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Relay (192.168.1.6) (relays between Wireless client Bridge and LAN - to give wired clients access) <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wireless AP (Allows clients to get repeated signal)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Relay 2 (192.168.1.7) (relays between AP and LAN - to give extended wireless clients access)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; WAN port (currently not used).</p><br /><p>i followed the beginner&#039;s guide to openvpn<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.openvpn">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.openvpn</a></p><p>But i think this guide was intended that the WAN interface be the connect point for the OpenVPN service.</p><p>So i&#039;m wondering, when we want to forward the VPN port from the Main router to the OpenWRT and connect to the OpenVPN service, which interface should the connecting interface for OpenVPN?</p><p>Should I create another relay (relay3 192.168.1.8) and relay between Wireless bridge and OpenVPN service?</p><p>or should the openVPN service be binded to the client Bridge?</p><p>The goal here is to have vpn clients come through the main router --&gt; openwrt --&gt; open vpn and access the subnet 192.168.1.x</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><p>also on another note regarding the beginner&#039;s guide of openvpn,&nbsp; it mentions client setup, <br />&quot;Configure the network on the OpenWrt client&quot;<br />- is it referring to configuring another client? or does the openvpn server has to have a client also?</p><br /><br /><br /><p>Thanks in advance for your advice</p>									</div>

					<p>The guide you linked to refers to connecting two OpenWrt devices together with OpenVPN, one server and one client (it will support any other OpenVPN client as well).</p><p>Do you plan to run OpenVPN in routing (tun) or bridged (tap) mode? Routed mode is easiest, and you shouldn&#039;t run bridged unless you have to. Read more about differences at <a href="https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/BridgingAndRouting">community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/BridgingAndRouting</a>.</p><p>OpenVPN will have its own interface, tun0 or tap0 (tun1, tun2 and so on if you run multiple instances). You can set OpenVPN to listen on all interfaces for connecting clients (default). If you only want to listen on one interface, pick the one you are forwarding to from your WAN router.</p><p>You will probably need some firewall configuration as well. I currently run four OpenVPN instances on a device configured as a pseudobridge using relayd. Each on its own interface tun0-3, defined as vpn0-3 in /etc/config/network. Here is an excerpt of my /etc/config/firewall, showing the changes I made for OpenVPN:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config zone

You would have one configured with <strong>dev tap</strong> and <strong>server_bridge</strong> directives, and the other with <strong>dev tun</strong> and <strong>server</strong> directives. Create client configurations tailored to the different clients.</p>									</div>

					<p>Assuming you have the OpenWRT server on the Buffalo 600 and you will be connecting through your &quot;Main Router&quot;, your clients will be pointing at the&quot;front door&quot; of your main router at [WANIP:PORT] .&nbsp; You need to move the traffic from your main router to the Buffalo.&nbsp; You will need at least a port forward from the main router to the Buffalo I think (not sure with the relayd stuff) 192.168.1.5:[PORT]</p><p>I built this under DD-WRT and had to port forward and set some firewall rules on the main router to get the traffic through to the VPN device.&nbsp; You may want to see the DD-WRT site on the port forward and firewall rules, at least for the concept.

					<p>Thanks for the tip RangerZ.&nbsp; Actually right now, it turns out that i&#039;m having problems with my installation of openvpn.&nbsp; Learning how to troubleshoot it.&nbsp; So far I&#039;ve been up each night until 2am learning bit by bit about OpenWrt and all it&#039;s possible features.&nbsp; Thanks to you guys, I know that it&#039;s possible to do what I want with it.&nbsp; Will keep you guys posted.</p>									</div>
