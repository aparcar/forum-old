					<p>I apologize for the double topic. I made a typo in the first one and the title was misleading.</p><p>Right now my WRT54GL is very reliable and fits all my needs, but since my parents need a new router I&#039;m planning to give them my Linksys and buy something more up-to-date for me. I&#039;ve narrowed my search to these two models. I can buy them at the same price (55€/60€, Buffalo has no shipping costs) and AFAIK both should be supported by OpenWrt.</p><p>Anyway, these are my requirements:<br />* well supported by OpenWrt community<br />* no issues / working out-of-the-box with OpenWrt<br />* home scenario with 4 to 5 clients, both LAN and WLAN (G only right now)<br />* not much traffic (just web and few SD streams, almost no p2p, no VoIP)<br />* wireless LAN must be reliable (no disconnections, decent range for an apartment)<br />* USB capabilities (printer/NAS) are welcome as a bonus, not a primary feature</p><p>Which one would you buy? TP-Link TL-WR1043ND or Buffalo WZR-HP-G300N?</p><p>Price and reliability wise, should I just consider buying a new WRT54GL for my parents? It&#039;s less than 40€ now.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>i have 2 WRT54GL and recently switched to TL-WR1043ND because with WRT you&#039;re stuck at brcm-2.4 (brcm-63xxx is unreliable when the device is under cpu load). the TP-LINK is awesome, best buy for the money.</p><p>don&#039;t get a WRT for your parents, get them a TP-LINK.</p>									</div>

					<p>The WR1043ND is a piece of decent hardware at a decent price. In Germany you can get it for € 42,- including 19% sales tax! Add shipping cost of none to € 7,-<br /><a href="http://gh.de/?phist=486889&amp;age=9999">http://gh.de/?phist=486889&amp;age=9999</a></p><p>Also consider that TP-Link does not fuck with their customers like, e.g. Buffalo likes to do, so there should be no problems flashing OpenWrt directly with the Webinterface of the OEM firmware! There should also be no problems with the bootloader or bad surprises with new hardware revisions. AFAIK, the number behind the comma doesn&#039;t even mean a new hardware revision with TP-Link products, only new firmware. So HW 1.0 is the same hardware as 1.9. Though I am not 100% sure about this.</p><p>If you want 5GHz or even simultaneous dual radio and/or more RAM, you could look here: <a href="http://gh.de/?cat=wlanrout&amp;xf=758_Dual+Band~758_Dual+Band+%28simultan%29&amp;sort=p">http://gh.de/?cat=wlanrout&amp;xf=758_D … amp;sort=p</a><br />and then compare with the OpenWrt ToH:&nbsp; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start</a></p><br /><p>Overall I would not pay too much for such embedded hardware, because this babies here are brand new and pretty hot:<br /><a href="http://gh.de/?pg=2&amp;cat=mbson&amp;xf=1123_AMD+E-350&amp;sort=p">http://gh.de/?pg=2&amp;cat=mbson&amp;xf … amp;sort=p</a></p><p>The second cheapest is already supported by coreboot! It ain&#039;t a router, but for € 80,- you can have a lot of fun with it. And at the end of this year intel comes with new 22nm hardware (no Atoms though). Thus I would not pay more than € 40,- a wireless router.</p>									</div>

					<p>I personally like a little more than 8MB flash and 32MB RAM.. 32/64 or 32/128 are my minimum. Then again, I&#039;m not using them for home purposes.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks everybody!</p><p>It looks like WZR-HP-G300N has better hw specs (32flash 64RAM vs. 8flash 32RAM) but it seem less supported by the community and I would trade better specs for good support and no hassles any time. <br />I don&#039;t need a feature loaded embedded appliance (I guess fredoombox, plug computers and ITX mainboards are the way to go in that case). All I&#039;m looking for is a vanilla wireless router with possibly extra features to play with as a bonus. <br />So... what is the best choice for a low-end community-supported router?</p>									</div>

					<p>The WR1043ND is cheap and well supported.<br />I&#039;ve been using one for more than a year now and have never failed to find the assistance, here on openwrt, that I need to work with it.<br />It&#039;s never failed me once, flash updates are easy, generic failsafe works as described.<br />I&#039;m currently running bleeding edge trunk without problems.</p><p>Your basic list of requirements should include 8mb of flash minimum (which the WR1043ND has). Trying to work with 4mb is a balancing act that almost always ends with you having to leave out something that you wanted to include in your build. And if you do build yourself, you can remove things you don&#039;t use allowing you to make even better use of the 8mb that you have. </p><p>For the price, features and support, WR1043ND is a winner for me.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t see any difference in support by the community between the two models once OpenWRT is up and running <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Both routers are fully supported by OpenWRT and I never had any problems with the Buffalo units (except for a bit trickier first flash, but once you do it 2 or 3 times, it&#039;s not a problem at all).<br />Taking that into account, I wouldn&#039;t settle for lower hw specs :-). It&#039;s true that depends on the desired usage and I do put Netgear units where top performance is required, but still...my old Asus 500GP had 32MB RAM, I wouldn&#039;t go below 64 nowadays <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Well, when it comes to hardware problems I guess it&#039;s easier to find a solution if more people have the same router.</p><p>Of course WZR-HP-G300N has much better hardware, but according to its wiki page:<br />* I could face problems with the hw revision (ethernet switch)<br />* flashing procedure is somewhat awkward <br />* there could be wireless hiccups (ticket 8343, WAN and DHCP)</p><p>I even read some not-so-good reviews about it (ok, mostly customers reviews), found a specific blog (<a href="http://g300nh.blogspot.com">http://g300nh.blogspot.com</a>) and read DD-WRT wiki page reporting wireless dropouts (well... maybe it&#039;s okay with OpenWRT).</p><p>That&#039;s why I&#039;ve not ordered one yet and I&#039;m looking at TL-WR1043ND which is a cheaper and has worse specs but should work just fine.</p>									</div>
