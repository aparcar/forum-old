					<p>I&#039;m about to give up on this. I have 3 MR12s and a couple of Outdoor (sparkeys?) that i would love to be able to use, but I just spent 3 days trying to figure out the settings for the serial connection on the MR12s. Nothing seems to give a good output. At first i thought: Cisco, but the MR12 are from before Cisco bought Meraki. Nowhere can I find documentation on this. Even in this thread, no one explicitly says what settings they used for the serial connection. It looks like it should be 115200 speed, but i still get gibberish!</p><p>Anyone have documentation on the speed/data/stop bits/etc on the MR12s by any chance?</p><p>If i can&#039;t figure it out, they are all goin to the recyclers.</p><p>thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>I just signed up to say thanks for all your hard work guys! I successfully flashed my Meraki MR12 with OpenWrt thanks to the excellent instructions and links here (<a href="https://github.com/riptidewave93/Openwrt-MR12-MR16/releases/tag/1.3">https://github.com/riptidewave93/Openwr … es/tag/1.3</a>).</p><br /><p>One quick question - after flashing, the MAC address is now 00:03:7F:E0:00:2A (seems to be a generic one from Atheros Communications, Inc.) instead of the original one labeled on the bottom (00:18:0A:**:**:** from Meraki, Inc.). Any ideas?</p><p>This could be a problem for people with multiple MR12s and/or MR16s at the same location.</p><br /><p>Thanks again riptide_wave, wooyah and everyone else who helped for all your hard work and perseverance!</p>									</div>
