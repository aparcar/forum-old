					<p>First of all sorry for my bad english.:-( I&#039;m trying to develop a new OpenWrt package but some points in the How To example are not very clear for me and moreover it&#039;s not complete. Can you suggest me a good documentation? Thanks for your help.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry, I really didn&#039;t want to offend you for your work. What I meant is that it is &quot;only&quot; an How To and not a complete manual. It&#039;s without doubt a good work, but not enough for my poor knowledges (this is the real point):(.<br />Thanks for your answer.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>poluka</strong> on 11 Dec 2005, 12:51)</p>

					<p>You could give us a hint on what you feel is missing, then maybe one of us will look into it and document that aspect of it.</p><p>Full documentation is more of a luxury good. Clich√© programmers don&#039;t like documentation (I don&#039;t either <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> and its almost as much work as it is to write the code.&nbsp; <br />But reaching the goal of having a fully documented SDK would be a great thing, it would just require more people that are willing to work on it.</p>									</div>

					<p>What&#039;s missing is any explanation of the config files. There is a section heading that says &#039;Creating the Required Files&#039;, but it never actually says which are required. It says they &quot;can&quot; be created. Are they optional? Which are created automatically by the SDK (if any) ?&nbsp; Where did the files come from? What parts do I need to customize to my package? Which parts are reusable? What is the syntax of the customization?</p><p>I&#039;ve read some places that make it sound as if all I need to do is put my package source in a sub directory of SDK/package and then &#039;make&#039; from the package directory and the SDK does the rest. But the Howto implies that would not do anything until I first modify my package&#039;s Makefile and add a Config.in and so forth. So if I need to add files, I would love some information saying that is so and what to put in them. Or where could I look to figure out how. Which environment variables do I define arbitrarily, which do I need to look up, which are defined by the SDK? </p><p>I would be happy to write up this info into documentation if someone else can help answer my questions until I can make sense of it.</p><p>It would be a shame for the SDK software to get less use than it could if it were more publicly accessible by virtue of documentation. Thanks for any assistance.</p>									</div>
