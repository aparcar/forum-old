					<p>Hello all.&nbsp; I recently got a WRT54GS v1.0 from a thrift store for $5 and put OpenWRT on it as soon as I got it home.&nbsp; One planned use for it is simply as a switch, connected to my 1043ND v2.0.&nbsp; I was just about to assign the WAN port as a LAN port, but noticed it would not allow me to install packages over a LAN port.&nbsp; Packages installed fine when using the WAN port (as a WAN port).</p><p>So, is there a way to install packages over LAN as opposed to WAN?</p><p>Thanks for any help</p>									</div>
