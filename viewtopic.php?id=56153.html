					<p>I have built/compiled/installed hd-idle package on my Seagate GoFLEX Home unit (comes with a 1 TB SATA HDD). My /etc/config/hd-idle file is as shown below. However, hd-idle doesn;t seem to spin down the SATA HDD when idle for more than 5 minutes. Does anyone here have any idea how to fix this?<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;hd-idle&#039;

					<p>I changed the <em>idle_time_interval</em> back to 10 minutes (default) and it still won&#039;t spin down the HDD after 10 minutes. Does this mean there is a problem with hd-idle?</p><p>I did a <em>ps | grep hd-idle</em> and here is the output that shows it was running:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[root@GoFLEX:/root 1%] # ps|grep hd-idle

					<p>I explored with USB SATA HDD Controllers.<br />USB Controllers firmware typically have a power down time option nowadays if it is enabled you don&#039;t need HD-IDLE, if it is not enabled the HDD will never go to sleep.<br />HD-IDLE was designed more for PATA HDD where it was not as sophisticated previously.<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7c6XZRqKkF0/U5qZVOF_d5I/AAAAAAAAAFc/NvsakImOU48/s1600/Untitled.png" alt="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7c6XZRqKkF0/U5qZVOF_d5I/AAAAAAAAAFc/NvsakImOU48/s1600/Untitled.png" /></span></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>alphasparc</strong> on 9 Mar 2015, 16:47)</p>

When my GoFLEX Home boots off of its NAND storage, the HDD is configured not to automatically get mounted. As such, I would think it should completely have no activities at all (remains idle all the time) and should get spun down with 5 minutes (default 10 minutes), but it doesn&#039;t. When a HDD gets spun down, it should cool down after over night. In my case, my HDD still feels as warm as when it is used as the main boot drive.</p>									</div>
