					<p>Cisco in their webinars are handing out these now.</p><p>Its a beast of a AP and sadly after the 3 years, seems to be worthless.</p><p>The ideal thing is to firmware flash it and keep using it because 802.11ac will take over the next couple of years because 802.11ad still has a bit to go.</p><p>So, any support or look into this?</p><p>Thank you</p>									</div>

					<p>I was also sort of hoping to get an MR18, but received an MR33 instead. Still, happy to test it, tear it apart, etc. The SoC hardware is broadly similar to the MR18, so there is hope if the storage can be accessed.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thepcpenguin was probably asking about a device already enrolled in the Meraki cloud, so this is the way it goes. It tells you that it&#039;s going to be updated and either does it on its own or lets you reschedule the update to some time in the future.</p><p>Haven&#039;t tried the Meraki dashboard yet, but that&#039;s what their documentation says.</p><p>Interesting that the Merakis update themselves on first boot even without being enrolled. Gotta check that, though you&#039;re probably right.</p><p>Anyway, thanks for your work Chris. I have a couple of MR18 AP&#039;s running LEDE thanks to your work and these things are rock solid.</p>									</div>
