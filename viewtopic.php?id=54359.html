					<p>Hi,</p><p>First of all: I am a beginner using OpenWrt on my Router. Please pardon if I just miss something and am making a big thing out of it.</p><p>Lately I got a new TP-Link Archer C5 v1.20. I installed everything according to <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr7500">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr7500</a> which also gives an image of barier braker and the instructions on how to install it. After doing all this I ended up with a working setup (everything is fine till now).<br />Next thing I did was enabling htmode HT40 for radio1, which is the 2.4 GHz wifi. This went fine, too. Now I am no longer stuck to slow speed links but getting 144.4 Mbit/s on all 2.4 GHz connections.<br />The only thing is I could not get the 5 GHz wifi on radio0 to use more then 6 Mbit/s which is quite low. So I tried to do the same as I did for radio1, too. The only problem is: As soon as I add any htmode (using the web-UI or by editing the /etc/config/wireless file) the wifi adapter does not start up any more and 5 GHz is gone totally. It does not really matter if I set it to HT20 HT40 or VHT80. It is just gone. After removing this line (and a restart of the wifi adapter) everything is back at the previous state: running at a speed of 6 Mbit/s.</p><p>According to other pages I found this should work fine and it seems as if others were successfull using VHT80.</p><p>Is there anything I missed out while setting up the radio0? Do I have to install anything else to make it work? Do you think using another image might solve the issue?</p><p>My current /etc/config/wireless:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-device &#039;radio0&#039;

					<p>I figured out, that changing the country code to DE (which is my actual location) removed all the channels &gt; 100. Now as I picked another one (40) HT40 is possible (which gives my a transfer rate laptop-&gt;router of 300Mbit/s). One bad thing about it is, that for those channels only 50mW txpower which is not to much at all, but I&#039;ll deal with the regdomain later on.</p><p>But this is only half way through the problem. The link router-&gt;laptop is still at 6Mbit/s (at least the router states it is). </p><p>The output of dmesg is:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[    0.000000] Linux version 3.10.49 (bb@builder1) (gcc version 4.8.3 (OpenWrt/Linaro GCC 4.8-2014.04 r42625) ) #3 Wed Oct 1 14:00:51 CEST 2014

					<p>Today I did some further tests (do not know if they really help) to figure out what I can possibly change.<br />It seems as if I am getting data rates up to 65Mbit/s (ways better than 6Mbit/s, but still not 300Mbit/s as I hope to get)</p><p>Thank you so far for the hints given, as changing the country code and channel gave me a connection at all and the speed reported within luci seems to be invalid (so maybe it works now I just do not know for shure?!?) If anyone knows a way to get the real speed on the command line this would really help getting closer to what really happens. So far I just found a way to do this if I am on the client, not on the ap. Thus I only get the speed client-&gt;ap (which seems to be fine anyways).</p><p>1.: Capturing all traffic with another device using wireshark.<br />Result: wireshark tells me that all frames sent by the router have a data rate of 6Mb/s (which is the same value luci reports, so it seems to be correct, even thou I still cannot tell if luci would report anything else if the data rate is higher)<br />Additional info after more tests: wireshark seems to give different results while luci sticks to 6Mb/s. So it seems as if lucy does not know propperly...<br />EDIT: there was an error within my wireshark filter! It seems to give data rates up to 65Mbit/s! which is not that bad!<br />Is it possibly that I only get this low rates due to wireshark not recognizing VHT with multiple channels used (as my filter fixes it to one channel) or does this really indicate that I am bound to a maximum data rata of 65Mbit/s?<br />My current filter is: (wlan.ta == &lt;router mac&gt; &amp;&amp; radiotap.channel.type.5ghz == 1 &amp;&amp;&nbsp; !(wlan.da == ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff)) &amp;&amp; (wlan.da == &lt;device mac&gt;)</p><p>2.: Forcing bitrates using &#039;iw wlan0 set bitrates legacy-5 ht-mcs-5 vht-mcs-5&#039;<br />Result:<br />&nbsp; &#039;iw wlan0 set bitrates legacy-5 18 ht-mcs-5 vht-mcs-5&#039; resulted in 6Mbit/s in luci, 18 Mbit/s in wireshark.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I also tested other values (6, 12, 18, 24) with the same result: luci: 6Mbit/s, wireshark: the set Mbit/s (6,12,18,24)<br />&nbsp; &#039;iw wlan0 set bitrates legacy-5 ht-mcs-5 0 vht-mcs-5&#039; resulted in no longer getting any data transferred (same for values 1-23)<br />&nbsp; &#039;iw wlan0 set bitrates legacy-5 ht-mcs-5 vht-mcs-5 1:0&#039; or any other value in range (1..3):(0...9) endet up with nothing transferred at all</p><p>3.: Changing the country code back to US did not change anything, too (as some people on the net had problems with the DE country code) </p><p>4.: creating a custom board.bin<br />According to the thread <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=44201&amp;p=20">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 1&amp;p=20</a> in some cases a custom board.bin can help out.<br />I tried this but it did not change anything.</p><p>5.: exchanging the firmware<br />I tried to use a different firmware downloaded from <a href="http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/ath10k/firmware">http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Dri … k/firmware</a><br />To be more precise I tested the one within 10.1 and master. I did not test 10.2</p><p>I wonder if there are any firmware api v1 files around. As according to my dmesg output it seems to look for otp.bin (+firmware.bin?) which belongs to the version 1 api. If anyone knows how to obtain these I would be glad to do so.</p><p>Some more (possibly useful output):<br />iw reg get:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>country DE: DFS-ETSI

Maybe I have to think about another way to measure speed in the future...</p><p>Another comparison: pc &lt;-&gt; router &lt;-&gt; other pc (via 100Mbit/s and 1Gbit/s LAN)<br />Result: 93.479.080 bit/s uplink (~93Mbit/s), 94.102.062 bit/s downlink (~94Mbit/s) as expected</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sebastian.rueckerl</strong> on 3 Dec 2014, 17:12)</p>
