					<p>Hello!</p><p>I don&#039;t know if this is possible but... here it goes... Is it possible to give a device 2 different funcionalities at the same time?<br />I mean, I need my device to work as a simple switch (ethernet port block) and to work as a wifi repeater (radio block).</p><p>Is this configuration possible? <br />Maybe, by default, the wifi reapear mode will make my ethernet ports&nbsp; work as a simple switch and this is a no-problem. Can someone confirm this?</p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pedro.duarte.pt</strong> on 8 Jul 2013, 17:18)</p>
