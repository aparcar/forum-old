					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have 5 Linksys WRT54GLs with Whiterussian 0.9 installed.</p><p>I want to use 4 of these to build a single network over a large area with several rooms and some thick walls. Ideally, the network would be totally seamless. Security is not an issue, and it&#039;s just a LAN, no internet required. Running ethernet cable around the space IS an option.</p><p>The 5th Linksys is mounted on a mobile robot. I have this box set up in Client (Bridge) Mode, and am streaming video from a networked camera to a computer tethered to one of the APs.</p><p>Ive set up the Client-&gt;AP, so I know that works. I then added a second AP, and joined it with the first using WDS. I have the essid/channel/no security on both APs. This works as well, and I can join the client to either and ping all the boxes.</p><p>So far so good. But when the client is roaming, the connection will drop until it joins on to the next AP. My first question is: is there anything I can do to minimize the time of the dropped signal, or to eliminate it? I imagine this would be on the client side.</p><p>My second question is: in my situation, would I be better off daisy-chaining all of the APs using ethernet than using WDS? if I set the essid&#039;s all the same, is that essentially the same network as with WDS? is that all a &quot;backbone&quot; is? finally, would this make any difference with my roaming issues? sorry if those are naive questions, Im new at this.</p><p>all the best.</p>									</div>
