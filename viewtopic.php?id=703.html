					<p>Hi there,</p><p>perhaps it&#039;s just too late today, and/or I spent already too much time on this, but I&#039;ve got a problem with compiling the OpenWRT:</p><p>I&#039;m using an ASUS WL-500g.<br />At first I tried the latest snapshot, it worked fine (I flashed from the original firmware to the snapshot with the windows tool from ASUS).</p><p>But now I want to include the modules needed to run a USB-stick. So I did a CVS-checkout, and said &quot;make&quot;. The compiler runs through happily.</p><p>Now I took the kernel.config from this post <a href="http://www.openwrt.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=460">http://www.openwrt.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=460</a> and copied it to sources/openwrt/kernel/kernel.config , said &quot;make clean&quot; and &quot;make&quot; again.<br />Afterwards I have the .trx-file again, but if I flash it, the USB-Modules are not in the /lib/modules/2.4.20/ directory, although I can find all these modules somewhere in the build_mipsel directory.</p><p>I&#039;m sure this is addressed somewhere, but could anyone point me to the right place to look? Why aren&#039;t the modules in the ROM-file?</p><br /><p>thanx in advance,<br /> Harry</p>									</div>
