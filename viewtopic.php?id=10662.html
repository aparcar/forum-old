					<p>With so little information and so many rumors regarding the Kamikaze release, I figured I&#039;d start the definitive thread to answer the basic questions and get people on the right track.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Feel free to ask questions about Kamikaze, we&#039;ll keep updating the FAQ.<br />Try to ask generic questions; tech support belongs in another thread.</p></blockquote></div><p><strong>What is Kamikaze?</strong></p><p>Kamikaze was forked from Whiterussian years ago to provide a platform for experimental code. It integrates many new packages, updates, bug fixes and rewrites. </p><p>New platforms - <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/wiki/platforms">https://dev.openwrt.org/wiki/platforms</a></p><p><strong>Is Kamikaze really getting rid of nvram? can we add it back?</strong></p><p>Yes. No. Let me explain -</p><p>A typical 4MB flash chip is segmented into 64k erase blocks, altering the contents of flash means erasing the entire block; these blocks are rated for 100,000 erase cycles before they wear out. To deal with this problem, the JFFS2 filesystem has a concept called wear leveling, think of it as a defragment that moves the data around so you wear out the entire space allocated to JFFS2 evenly. In contrast, NVRAM is a fixed location at the end of the flash, exactly one block in size, which means that you only have 100,000 &quot;nvram commits&quot; before you risk wearing out the flash. (the original firmwares would typically commit and reboot for every settings page -- but they made money selling the routers so I don&#039;t think they cared)</p><p>Moving the configuration from NVRAM to JFFS2 has allowed us to organize the configuration in a meaningful way, removing the obscure variable names and even adding comments to the config files. That&#039;s not to say that it isn&#039;t without a few drawbacks, namely the fact reflashing will wipe the filesystem and reinstall the default configs -- this seems to be the biggest concern, and understandably so. Here&#039;s what&#039;s going to happen:</p><p> * When reflashing from one Kamikaze release to the next, there will be an upgrade util to preserve your settings -- provided you reflash from within OpenWrt/Kamikaze. (currently a work in progress)<br /> * If you reflash to Kamikaze from another firmware, or use tftp, the configuration will not be preserved, and the device will revert back to Kamikaze&#039;s defaults.</p><p>Everyone will start with the same defaults (as limited by the model) and it&#039;s assumed that you will always reflash using the upgrade util to upgrade to the next release. If for any reason you lock yourself out or want to reset to defaults, you simply reflash.</p><p><strong>Does this mean we get the extra space from nvram?</strong></p><p>No.</p><p>On bootup, the bootloader (CFE) will check for the existence of nvram and recreate it if the partition can&#039;t be found. So, technically you could use it, but the amount of space gained would be insignificant and any data stored there would be wiped out upon reboot.</p><p><strong>Will there be a Kamikaze RC1?</strong></p><p>[s]We still haven&#039;t decided what we&#039;re going to call it, but there will be Kamikaze release soon.[/s] Unfortunately I can&#039;t promise that there will be a plethora of new Kamikaze documentation to go with the new release, so we&#039;ll certainly be looking for volunteers to help us.</p><p>Kamikaze has been released as 7.06.</p><p><strong>Is there a Quickstart guide to help people migrate to Kamikaze?</strong></p><p>Not yet.</p><p><strong>Why doesn&#039;t Kamikaze support the WRT54GL?</strong></p><p>Actually it does.</p><p>The confusion seems to be the fact many newer models are based around the BCM53xx series when the 2.6 tree is labeled 47xx. Broadcom uses a System on Chip (SoC) model, integrating multiple chips into a single chip; the BCM5352 features the same CPU as a BCM4712, and also integrates the switch functionality of a BCM5325 -- the two chips found in previous models.</p><p><strong>Is it true there&#039;s no wifi in Kamikaze?</strong></p><p>Most Kamikaze platforms use a 2.6.x kernel, the single exception is the Broadcom, and the reason for that is the Broadcom wireless module. In short, if you want working wireless support for Broadcom you will need to use the 2.4 kernel. When the bcm43xx driver is stable it will be added to the 2.6 kernels, and the 2.4 kernel will be removed.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mbm</strong> on 4 Jun 2007, 02:11)</p>

					<p>Q: Will the nvram block/data still exist?</p><p>I think this is the answer...</p><p>A. Yes.&nbsp; Kamikaze does not change the basic bootloader (cfe?).&nbsp; Since this bootloader checks and restores a corrupt nvram block this block must remain where it is.&nbsp; Also, the presence and content of this nvram block is critical if the unit is ever returned to other firmware.</p><br /><p>I&#039;m an old hardware guy that likes memory maps.&nbsp; Do some exist I missed?&nbsp; I constructed what I got from discussion here for my WRT54Gv4 and WRT54GSv3 in a simple spreadsheet and wondering if they have any value besides old hardware guys. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>As I have read (and understood) at one faq&#039;s answer, now nvram info is useless and kamikaze does not use it. Isn&#039;t it? But I still have a question:</p><p>Q: Is it safe to erase the whole nvram with &quot;mtd -r erase nvram&quot; as pointed in <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=11402">this thread</a>?</p><p>A: Yes, it is. Since Kamikaze does not use any more the nvram for configuration purposes, deleting de nvram is now secure. Even more, the nvram will be set with the minimal factory defaults.

					<p>A second vote for this.</p><p>Actually, preserving the current settings is not as important to me as being able to upload some fresh settings at reflash time. That is, something like this:</p><p>(1) copy a .trx image to RAM<br />(2) copy some config files to RAM (e.g. in a tar file, or even a shar file / shell script)<br />(3) run something like &#039;mtd ...&#039; to reflash the .trx file from (1) *and* create a fresh jffs2 partition containing the files uploaded in (2)<br />(4) reboot, system comes live with the uploaded settings</p><p>The reason for this is that the device may be remote, and losing the jffs2 data may also lose connectivity to the box (e.g. WPA-PSK not set, firewall rules not set to allow incoming ssh etc). At the moment my only option is to encode the WPA-PSK and other settings within the .trx file itself, using the ImageBuilder, but then every combination of settings requires an entire new .trx file.</p>									</div>
