					<p>I have the following setup:</p><p>LAN A <br />10.10.0.0/24<br />Router A (OpenWRT): 10.10.0.1<br />DNS domain: lan.example.com</p><p>LAN B:<br />10.20.0.0/24<br />Router B (non-OpenWRT): 10.20.0.1<br />DNS domain: lan.example.com</p><p>Both LANs are connected via VPN and communication works fine. What I want to do is setup Router A such that any queries to *.lan.example.com will try both the local DNS/dnsmasq server on Router A, as well as the router B if a matching host on LAN A is not found. I already got the reverse working fine. </p><p>I could just set the hosts I want on /etc/hosts on each LAN A client, but I don&#039;t want that.</p><p>Here is what I have so far, but it doesnt work. Whenever I try to lookup a local client e.g. foo.lan.example.com, nslookup just hangs. There is also an error message on OpenWRT: &quot;Maximum number of concurrent DNS queries reached (max: 150)&quot;</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config dnsmasq

					<p>Untried and untested because I lack your concrete scenario: dnsmasq has an option, <em>dns-loop-detect</em>, but from the man page it seems that it permanently disables servers that loop back to the instance.
