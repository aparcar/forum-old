					<p>Hi,</p><p>I want to know if it is possible to configure an vpn server on openwrt, but I don&#039;t want to open any port in the telecom company router. Is it possible with openvpn? Can I install n2n-ntop vpn that I think it is supported? another possibility?</p><p>Thanks,</p>									</div>

					<p>hi togarha,</p><p>maybe you should clarify what do you need/want exactly?</p><p>First of all: are you not able to open a port (e.g. no access to the telecom-router)? or do you just don&#039;t want to? (why????)</p><p>even when you are using n2n (which is available for openwrt) there is now way around the fact, that you need one machine somewhere which is reachable by the other nodes. <br />This can be an openvpn-server, a n2n-supernode, or whatever but it has to be reachable! </p><p>So as fyi wrote, if you can run a n2n supernode (which you have to do, you can not use &quot;some external server&quot; you have to use &quot;your external server&quot;) somewhere (and open a port for it) you could run openvpn-server there, too. You could interconnect both clients through this server. <br />The only advantage of n2n seems to be that you would be able to establish a direct-p2p connection of the two clients (with support of the supernode). I guess this is similar to the technique of session-hijacking which skype uses to deal with symetric-firewall-situations. but in any case it&#039;s a hack and it won&#039;t get you more security, it probaly results in less security. </p><br /><p>kind of O.T. but&nbsp; I&#039;m just wondering if you could use n2n to secure a 802.11s network. afaik encryptions isn&#039;t possible under the open80211s-implimentation yet. and in this setting it probably would make sense cause of the p2p-topology of the network underneath.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 17 Jan 2011, 23:25)</p>

					<div class="quotebox"><cite>togarha wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I&#039;m trying to make that, but I can&#039;t access to company router...</p></blockquote></div><p>I think what fyi tried to say is that you could set up a openvpn-server, or a n2n-supernode on your router at home (if you have a broadband connection at home) and open the port of the service. <br />If your connection is fast enough I would recommend running openvpn and connect your laptop and your machine at work as clients to this server. All the traffic between them would be redirected through your openvpn-server (and your broadband-connection at home) ... you can configure this very secure.<br />if the bandwidth isn&#039;t enough you could try setting up a n2n-supernode at home and both clients should connect to it. the advantage would be&nbsp; that only the traffic for initial creation of the tunnel between your laptop and your machine at work would be redirected through your home-broadband-connection. the actual traffic would be send through a direct point-to-point connection between your laptop and the machine at work.&nbsp; (at least this is what they claim on their homepage) but n2n (at least v1) is not very secure, but probably enough for your application</p>									</div>
