					<p>I had successfully installed DD-WRT build, factory-to-ddwrt from the Router Databse page of DD-WRT.com, it didn&#039;t have the OpenVPN option. I successfully flashed back to stock TP-link firmware, TL-WR941ND_V2_V3_120201, from the TP-Link website. Tried to flash OpenWRT, openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr941nd-v3-squashfs-factory, the install hung for over an hour.</p><p>Now I cannot reach the router gui on 192.168.1.1. I read a forum post to ping the router and check the ttl return, it is ttl-64. So I understand this to mean that the router isn&#039;t bricked, I just cannot get into it. I placed the router into failsafe mode, quick flashing sys led, but I am not sure on the whole telnet thing and using it to fix the router. </p><p>I can telnet into the router when it&#039;s not in failsafe mode, but not when it is in failsafe. In failsafe it gives me a different ip address and is unaccessible. </p><p>Could someone plese give me a post to read or let me know what I need to do?</p>									</div>

					<p>Well. My router was really unstable. I had to reset it every 1 hour.

It boots, wifi connects and dhcp works. But I don&#039;t have any connectivity and I can&#039;t access the administration webpage. It tries to load the page, but reeeeeeeeeaallly slow and it never finishes (I can see the html structure of the page, but it does not finish loading).</p><p>For now I will buy another router because I need it.

My router was a little unstable with the original firmware and I though OpenWrt would make it rock stable. But It made it a lot worse. </p><p>I had previously flashed another device (WA901) and it worked incredibly fine (MUCH better than stock which was reeeeallly unstable). </p><p>So... OpenWrt is a gamble. The word &quot;stable&quot; means nothing for me anymore haha.</p>									</div>

					<p>Newest attitude adjustment seems to be working fine, but the wifi is not able to sustain perfect throughput throughout a speed test (my DIR-605L that I use as an simple access point can). I am the only one using wireless routers where I live and I tried switching both channels. Same behaviour. On newest trunk wasn&#039;t able to turn the wifi on and the protocol problem still exists.<br />I will test it further if I spot any instability with AA.</p><p>EDIT:</p><p>After doing 15-20 tests using iperf and a computer connected through cable the performance goes down to 1Mbps or less. I guess the driver is not going to higher rates after some usage.<br />Average performance was 10Mbps with direct line of sight, 10 meters and max power.<br />The D-Link one can do 38Mbps with a concrete wall in between, 50% of the power and 10m between my computer.
