					<p>I just signed up on OpenWRT (forum and wiki) and I thought I should introduce myself.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if such is a common practice (I don&#039;t see any intro postings, but then, I don&#039;t know how often new people join in here).</p><p>Until just recently, I&#039;ve pretty much ignored wireless routers.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t need one until a few weeks ago.&nbsp; Then I recognized multiple needs were coming, so I decided I better get try things out.&nbsp; Turns out to be a disaster because I made assumptions about how things were designed (things that seemed so obvious to me that I just didn&#039;t bother researching).&nbsp; So in the trial by fire, I got to learn quite a lot of things real fast (that, ironically, I might not have learned for ages had things worked as I expected).</p><p>I attempted to make 2 Netgear WGT624 routers talk to each other.&nbsp; Turns out they operate the radio side as access points (this not being documented in any Netgear literature, specs, or user guide). That didn&#039;t work.&nbsp; The routers have been returned for refund.&nbsp; What I learned during this was about the OpenWRT project.&nbsp; I had heard a while back that at least one company was using Linux for the OS.&nbsp; But I didn&#039;t know people were building their own custom images to run on them.&nbsp; So that changed my whole approach and here I am.</p><p>However, I&#039;m not one to just settle for &quot;Linux out of the box&quot; and run it like that.&nbsp; Based on my many years of programming (primarily C, some assembly) experience, networking experience (lots of Cisco), and system administration experience (mainframes and many *nix systems), Linux is like soft putty to me.&nbsp; I rewrote all the rc scripts from scratch.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done small hacks to the kernel.&nbsp; I&#039;ve built my own CDROMs where one can boot from either Intel x86 or Sun Sparc, and done so based on Slackware, and then based on Linux From Scratch.</p><p>I enjoy the challenge of writing C code to work fast and small, without the need for bloat from dozens of add on libraries (although I am also collecting all my reusable functions into a big library of my own).&nbsp; I often just use dietlibc instead of glibc just for the fun of it. I&#039;ve been coding in C since 1982 (first on DECsystem-20).</p><p>So suddenly I do have an interest in developing, hacking, and packaging stuff for a router and OpenWRT seems like the ideal starting point.&nbsp; I do have a lot to learn, still, because many aspects of this I still don&#039;t know, nor have the tools downloaded to try out.&nbsp; And since returning those Netgear routers, I&#039;ve so far held off buying anything new until I&#039;m 100% certain of the direction I&#039;m going.&nbsp; But it looks like for now the Linksys WRT54GL is it.</p><p>I&#039;ll have more questions soon, I&#039;m sure.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got an unrelated project I&#039;m working on right now and it probably won&#039;t be done until the latter part of August.&nbsp; Then I&#039;ll see how much I can dive into working on doing some kind of development with this.</p>									</div>
