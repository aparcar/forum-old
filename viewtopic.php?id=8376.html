					<p>(Hoping not to be one of those clueless-newbie posts)</p><p>I&#039;ve just got a WRTSL54GS, and successfully loaded RC6. It rebooted and I could telnet in, set the password, and then ssh in. All appeared to be fine, though I didn&#039;t test much. Notably I didn&#039;t reboot again or power cycle after the initial setup. The router is currently not routing, but just sitting on the LAN on the inside of my network (until I&#039;m happy with the setup) so I added a default route to my existing gateway, and could see the net.</p><p>Then I thought I&#039;d load webif^2 (I know, I know, I&#039;ve got what&#039;s coming to me ....), which rather surprised me by forcing a reboot once installed. It never came back from the reboot....</p><p>It is sitting with the power light flashing (bootloader?), and does not get as far as putting the SES light on. I&#039;ve tried following the instructions for failsafe, but recvudp shows nothing. I&#039;ve tried hitting the reset button, with no change. Ping of 192.168.1.1 does work, but telnet and ssh do not. I have not tried holding the reset button down as I power cycle yet.</p><p>So I&#039;ve bricked it, and I&#039;m looking forward to soldering the JTAG and serial headers on (and have bought the requisite cables and adapters - isn&#039;t eBay great?). I may as well upgrade the USB port to a double while I&#039;m at it.</p><p>Before they arrive - two questions:<br />1) Does anyone have any ideas why this might have happened, or anything else to try?<br />2) If I solder a double USB connector on in place of the single, am I likely to be able to draw 2x 5v@500mA through the USB bridge chip? I need to run an external HD that wants 0.9A to spinup, so this seems the easiest way if the regulator inside is up to it. Clearly it can do 1x 5v@500mA.</p><p>Peter</p>									</div>

					<p>I have an SL54 and had installed webif^2 under RC6, as the screen indicated the router does need to be rebooted after this is installed for the first time, and it should not have damaged your firmware in this way, but as you say, it&#039;s hard to say at this point what might have gone wrong.&nbsp; Looks like a reflaash should fix you up.</p>									</div>
