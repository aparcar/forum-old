					<p>Hi,</p><p>i have tested my both WRT54GS v1.1 with the new OpenWRT WhiteRussian RC5. In my first configuration I set the encryption mode to WPA1 with TKIP and the WDS link between the both routers are worked after the reboot. Second I set the encryption mode to WPA1 with AES and reboot the router. After a short moment the WDS link is up and working fine. In the third configuration i set the encryption to WPA2/TKIP and rebooted the both routers. The WDS link is down! In my last configuration i set the encryption to WPA2/AES and the same as in my third configuration the WDS link come´s not up.</p><p>I see on both routers the &quot;wds0.4915&quot; interface and the started service &quot;385 root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 484 S&nbsp; &nbsp;/usr/sbin/nas -P /var/run/nas.lan.pid -l br0 -H 34954 -i eth1 -A -m 128 -k a73901fa7bde63ffAac628ABFCDE649120987A63b665C536D7366&quot;</p><p>what is my problem? Any Idea´s?</p><p>Thanks a lot...</p><p>gretchen</p>									</div>

Thanks for the answer. </p><p>I have still one question to the nas binary. When i configure in the webinterface WPA(PSK) Mode=WPA2 Algo=AES and then i see the nas service &quot;/usr/sbin/nas -P /var/run/nas.lan.pid -l br0 -H 34954 -i eth1 -A -m 128 -k abcdef1234567890 -s test -w 4&quot;. </p><p>In the documentation from the nas binary is the -m 128 parameter PSK2 and not WPA2 (-m 64) is that correct? What is the different between WPA2 and PSK2?</p><p>Thanks a lot.</p><p>gretchen</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Gretchen,</p><p>I found your issue and wonder if you&#039;re seeing another example of same problem I see using TKIP on NAS.&nbsp; But my problem goes away using AES: <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=5084">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=5084</a></p><p>I found a very basic ethernet packet gets modified/corrupted.&nbsp; My problem existed on and I assume identical in RC4.&nbsp; I may experiment with the nas options - we have similar questions.</p><p>EDIT: I see in <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/nas">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/nas</a> that both wpa/wpa2 seems to infer only Radius Server Authentication while psk/psk2 is strictly PSK.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Bill_MI</strong> on 2 Apr 2006, 19:44)</p>
