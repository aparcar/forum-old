					<p>Hi,<br />I&#039;m having problems with a very unstable internet connection. I&#039;m having timeouts, low speeds, but the for some times, maybe a couple of minutes, it will work OK.<br />I started seeing this behaviour like a week ago. I can&#039;t remember changing any configuration at that moment. Now, trying to fix it, I think I have changed everything a couple of times <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>My connection looks like this:<br /></p><ul><li><p>a modem configured in bridge mode with no NAT, no DHCP server, and a fixed IP 192.168.1.1.</p></li><li><p>an OpenWrt router <br /></p><ul><li><p>WAN configured for PPPoE;</p></li><li><p>connected to the modem through an interface with IP 192.168.1.2</p></li><li><p>LAN bridge through an interface 192.168.2.1</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />If I ping from the router to the modem (192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.1), I see a 15%-30% packets lost.<br />If I plug my computer directly to the modem interface and ping, I dont have any packet loss and my internet works ok.<br />If I plug my computer directly to the router WAN interface and ping, I dont have any packet loss.<br />I&#039;m using the same ethernet cable for all testing.</p><p>So, I suspect that the source of my problem is the packet loss between the router and the modem.</p><br /><p>My setup:&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />I have an <strong>TP-Link TL-WDR4300 v1 running OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 / LuCI 15.05-149-g0d8bbd2 Release (git-15.363.78009-956be55)</strong>.<br />The modem is a <strong>P-660R-T1 v2</strong> from <strong>ZyXEL</strong>.</p><br /><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@router:~# cat /etc/config/network
