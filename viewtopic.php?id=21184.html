					<p>I made mmc mod on my Buffalo WHR-G54s and now I&#039;m trying to make sd-card partition to root partition. I followed instructions from <a href="http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs%282f%29KamikazeConfiguration%282f%29PackagesOnExternalMediaHowTo.html">http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs% â€¦ HowTo.html</a> I have created modified init script to /sbin/init and removed symlink to oldone. For some reason configurations are not read from /etc/config/bootfromexternalmedia although I have bootfromexternalmedia file that has configs as in the howto.</p><p>I tried to debug why the sript wont work. I made an echo line after configuration should be read. &#039;echo $gpiomask &gt; /root/status.txt&#039; and all that was in the file was empty line. So I quess that for some reason bootfromexternalmedia is not read.</p><p>Any way to fix this?</p>									</div>
