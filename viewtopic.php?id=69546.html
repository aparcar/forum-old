					<p>Apologies for my lack of dev knowledge and general amateur hackiness, <br />I am running CC v15.05 and trying to get logging to to an external usb drive working. I have spent many hours reading and trying to understand how this works and have managed to come up with the following commands which are set in the browser client (system &gt; startup &gt; local startup) to run at start up:</p><p>mount -t ext4 -U &lt;UID&gt; /mnt/usbdrive -o rw<br />sleep 1<br />mkdir /mnt/usbdrive/logs/syslog/$(date +&quot;%d.%m.%Y-%H.%M&quot;)<br />sleep 1<br />logread -f &gt; /mnt/usbdrive/logs/syslog/$(date +&quot;%d.%m.%Y-%H.%M&quot;)/logread.txt&amp;<br />sleep 1<br />mkdir /mnt/usbdrive/logs/klog/$(date +&quot;%d.%m.%Y-%H.%M&quot;)<br />sleep 1<br />dmesg &gt; /mnt/usbdrive/logs/klog/$(date +&quot;%d.%m.%Y-%H.%M&quot;)/dmesg.txt&amp;<br />exit 0 </p><p>I normally power off my unit every night so what I want to do is have openwrt log both logs to a seperate folder which it makes with the days date as the folder name when I power the unit on each day. To my immense surprise this actually works! but alas it only works intermittently at best, sometimes it logs every day for a few days and sometimes it doesnt work for weeks on end. I have tried adjusting the sleeps, taking them out, putting them back in and varying the lengths. But my knowledge is lacking on any thing else i can tinker with and i find myself unable to get this working reliably, <br />So I would be really grateful if someone could help me with this, any ideas or any help, pointers etc would be very much appreciated. </p><p>Cheers,<br />L</p>									</div>

					<p>Not sure if this is related to your problem or not...

If you only need them temporarily, put them in /tmp and it clears when the machine reboots. This could also be the problem.

					<p>I think I happened upon a solution to this, i installed &quot;libdbi&quot; (opkg install libdbi) and suddenly after 3 reboots in a row i am getting the new syslog/date.time, and klog/date.time folders each boot, each folder,containing the correct log as expected!<br />.</p>									</div>

					<p>*Note libdbi did not solve my issue. It worked for 3 reboots after I installed libdbi but has only worked once since then. I think the problem may be something to do with openwrt not having a time immediately after startup, as it has to wait for the external modem to get a web connection before it can get time. but adding in a sleep of up to 300 seconds before the logread command still does not solve the problem.<br />I will continue trying to figure this out and post here if i find a solution.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think I may have finally cracked this one, I found a config file at /etc/ulogd.conf which had a setting for the syslog that I experimented with ages ago, and that I long ago removed from the web interface. Makes me wonder if the web interface may be a little bit buggy? </p><p>When I use logread with -f the log records the subsequent entries, but misses out on the messages prior to the command running, without -f i get the prior messages. So I chain 2 commands to get all the data.<br />The commands that currently seem to be working when run at start up are as follows:<br />mkdir /mnt/usb/logs/syslog/$(date +&quot;%d.%m.%Y-%H.%M&quot;) ; logread &gt; /mnt/usb/logs/syslog/$(date +&quot;%d.%m.%Y-%H.%M&quot;)/logread_st.txt ; logread -f &gt; /mnt/usb/logs/syslog/$(date +&quot;%d.%m.%Y-%H.%M&quot;)/logread.txt&amp;<br />mkdir /mnt/lusb/logs/klog/$(date +&quot;%d.%m.%Y-%H.%M&quot;) ; dmesg &gt; /mnt/usb/logs/klog/$(date +&quot;%d.%m.%Y-%H.%M&quot;)/dmesg.txt&amp;<br />exit 0.</p>									</div>
