					<p>Hello,</p><p>after using a handful TP Linl TL-WDR4300 routers we decided to switch to Linksys WRT1200AC routers.<br />No i got our first one and started with flashing the newest stable image of openwrt on it.<br />I used the Wiki from here:<br />wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt_ac_series<br />And the image file &quot;V1 caiman&quot;:<br />downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05.1/mvebu/generic/openwrt-15.05.1-mvebu-armada-385-linksys-caiman-squashfs-factory.img</p><p>After flashing was done, the router was doing all well and i started to configure it following my screenshot documentation from our above mentioned TP Link routers.<br />I wondered why i have no menu option &quot;Switch&quot; under the menu &quot;Interfaces&quot; and i searched at google.<br />Now i have found a older ticket-10123 from 2008 (dev.openwrt.org/ticket/10123) with the exact same problem for an other router type.</p><p>After i fixed my problem with the solution to manually edit the /etc/config/network file, i searched here at this place for tickets with the bug i had for the Linksys WRT1200AC.<br />But i donÂ´t find any.<br />And so i decided to let you know, that i had this problem.</p><p>I hope this will help.</p><p>Best regards,<br />David</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Darkentik</strong> on 20 Dec 2016, 11:13)</p>
