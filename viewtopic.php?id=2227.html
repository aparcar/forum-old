					<p>Hello!</p><p>I have some suggestions on how to build a web configuration interface for OpenWRT.<br />I also have some ideas for a more general approach to configuring the OpenWRT-System.</p><p>First of all: I really like the NVRAM! It&#039;s really cool to have all the options stored in a place<br />where they won&#039;t be overwritten by the next firmware release. I&#039;d really like to have that<br />in the future. But there is also the problem with machines that don&#039;t have an NVRAM, right?</p><p>Here is my idea:<br />We can write a program (for example called &quot;wrtconf&quot;) that basically does the same as the<br />nvram command on the wrt54g, but takes a parameter where to store the values.<br />The new command can then store the values either in NVRAM or in a flat-file format <br />somewhere on the system.</p><p>All the configuration scripts would have to be altered in a very simple way: The would have<br />to call &quot;wrtconf get param_name&quot; instead of &quot;nvram get param_name&quot;.</p><p>Now the web interface: Every package includes a small file, that list the configuration options,<br />the choices you have for them and a small description for every parameter. With this kind<br />of file you can easily write a web interface or a even a menu driven shell interface (i&#039;ve seen<br />that kind of configuration interface on HP Switches and i really like it.)</p><p>Example for such a file that the package maintainers would have to include:</p><p># cat /usr/share/wrtconf/dnsmasq<br />name DNS-Server<br />option dnsmasq_enabled {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; desc &quot;Run a DNS server?&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; type chose<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; choice 1 &quot;Enable DNS-Server&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; choice 0 &quot;Do not run a DNS-Server&quot;<br />} <br />option dnsmasq_domain {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; desc &quot;Local domain name&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; type text<br />}</p><p>or you could do it in XML as well ...</p><br /><p>The interface than reads these files an generates a user interface (web or<br />menu driven shell interface).</p><p>Any comments.</p>									</div>
