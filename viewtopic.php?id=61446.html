					<p>I&#039;m trying to figure something out.&nbsp; I have a client on my network that works fine, until I connect it to a VPN. </p><p>My DNS server is at 192.168.4.1.</p><p>Particularly, ARP queries go through:</p><p>14:13:51.496074 ARP, Request who-has 192.168.4.1 tell 192.168.4.243, length 42<br />14:13:51.496152 ARP, Reply 192.168.4.1 is-at 00:0d:b9:35:c2:0d (oui Unknown), length 28</p><p>However, when I send its traffic through the vpn using ip route:</p><p>root@AP1:/etc/openvpn# ip route show table ovpn<br />default via 10.174.1.5 dev tun0<br />192.168.0.0/16 via 192.168.4.1 dev eth1.4</p><p>It never gets an ARP reply - the ARP Request who-has 192.168.4.1 just repeats and there&#039;s never a response.</p><p>This leads to sporadic failures - that device can&#039;t find name resolution, and it is frantically sending out ARP request.</p><p>So.... How do I get the gateway - 192.168.4.1 - to see and respond to the ARP request?</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, got it figured out.&nbsp; For posterity, the rules iproute2 sets up have a priority.&nbsp; if left unspecified, the priority is 0.&nbsp; The local routing table (the one that handles broadcasts and such) is priority 1, so any custom rules come before the local table.</p><p>So, to make it work, add any custom rules after the local table, or it will break your network in very subtle and confusing ways.</p><p>These rules are from my OpenVPN setup, routing all traffic except local through the VPN for host 192.168.4.15:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@AP1:~# ip rule show
0:    from all lookup 128 
1:    from all lookup local 
16384:    from 192.168.4.15 lookup ovpn 
32766:    from all lookup main 
32767:    from all lookup default </code></pre></div><p>and in the rule setup:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ip rule delete from 192.168.4.15 table ovpn
ip route flush table ovpn
ip route flush cache
ip rule add from 192.168.4.15 lookup ovpn priority 16384
ip route add table ovpn default via $route_vpn_gateway</code></pre></div>									</div>
