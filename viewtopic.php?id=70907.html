					<p>Hi to all,<br />I&#039;d like to run a web that uses PHP, on Apache. I&#039;ve installed it on Ubuntu with PHP7 and works, although it will not fully work without enabling mod_rewrite with sudo a2enmod rewrite.<br />I&#039;ve also installed it on OpenWRT, after moving LuCi to port 90, installing Apache and PHP5. Unfortunately, it does not fully work and it fails as on Ubuntu without mod_rewrite. Is it feasible to install it on OpenWRT Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 r49203?<br />The log error says: File does not exist: ... referer: ...</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>david_openwrt</strong> on 14 May 2017, 05:57)</p>

					<p>Might be problematic:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=11878">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=11878</a></p><p>However, depending, upon what you want do do, you might consider to exchange apache2 by nginx.<br />In newest LEDE, nginx has mod rewrite already included by default.<br />Otherwise, you should be able to build/compile own image incl. nginx+rewrite.</p><p>In the past, I also used apache2, but because of size and functionaliity I switched to nginx.</p>									</div>
