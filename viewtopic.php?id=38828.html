					<p>I am extremely new to this scene and i require a lot of help.<br />I recently bought a NETGEAR WNDR3800 and decided to install the OperWrt Firmware,however I cannot understand the criteria for choosing the right version of openwrt.<br />I checked the Table of Hardware available on their site and even though it includes the 3800 it lists as the supported openwrt version the r28597 which adds support for the 3800 given its higher RAM to its predecessor the 3700v2.So i would guess that the right version is the one listed in 3700v2 which is the Backfire 10.3.1 rc-5.However i dont get what to do with the r28597.Furthermore from the Downloads section i dont know which file i am supposed to download.I assume that this is the right directory <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1-rc5/ar71xx/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … c5/ar71xx/</a>&nbsp; , but is the jffs2 or the squashfs the way to go and on top of that which is the right extension, .bin or .img.</p><p>Thank you very much.As i said i&#039;m new to this, thus i require a lot of help.</p>									</div>

					<p>You should forget Backfire and take a new trunk.<br />3800 eats the same images as 3700v2. And there are separate trunk snapshots for 3800 in <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/</a></p><p>There are also ready community images, tailored for 3700/3800 in forum&#039;s community builds section, that fully support all the buttons in 3800 etc. </p><p>My build: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=28392">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=28392</a><br />(newest build from August 20th: <a href="http://koti.welho.com/hnyman1/Openwrt/trunk-r33212-2012-08-20/">http://koti.welho.com/hnyman1/Openwrt/t … 012-08-20/</a> )</p><p>Arokh&#039;s build: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27722">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27722</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 22 Aug 2012, 15:33)</p>
