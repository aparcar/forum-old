					<p>Hi, I&#039;m having problems finding a decent way to monitor packets dropped by iptables in realtime.</p><p>I have this perl (microperl) script that reads STDIN line by line and parses the lines. I tried this to pipe syslog DROP messages to the script:<br />root@OpenWrt:/etc# logread -f|/etc/blacklist-realtime.pl</p><p>But when new syslog messages come in, the script never receives them. Same happens if I try to grep the lines from logread -f:</p><p>on first terminal I type:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>root@OpenWrt:/etc# logread -f|grep hello</p></blockquote></div><p>on second one I type:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>root@OpenWrt:~# logger hello</p></blockquote></div><p>...but I can&#039;t see anything on the first terminal. Just to prove that the script itself works:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>root@OpenWrt:~# cat /etc/banner|/etc/blacklist-realtime.pl<br />Analyzing:&nbsp; &nbsp;_______&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;________&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; __<br />Analyzing:&nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|.-----.-----.-----.|&nbsp; |&nbsp; |&nbsp; |.----.|&nbsp; |_<br />Analyzing:&nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;||&nbsp; _&nbsp; |&nbsp; -__|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;||&nbsp; |&nbsp; |&nbsp; ||&nbsp; &nbsp;_||&nbsp; &nbsp;_|<br />Analyzing:&nbsp; |_______||&nbsp; &nbsp;__|_____|__|__||________||__|&nbsp; |____|<br />Analyzing:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|__| W I R E L E S S&nbsp; &nbsp;F R E E D O M<br />Terminating</p></blockquote></div><p>I&#039;m not very familiar with unix programming and how the pipes work, but shouldn&#039;t the script be able to analyze logread -f &#039;s output line by line?</p><p>If you know any better way to monitor dropped packets, other than parsing syslog&#039;s output, that would be cool too. BTW, this is my 2nd day with openwrt, pretty damn awesome system it is.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>keitsi</strong> on 24 Oct 2005, 01:04)</p>

					<p>logread is probably buffering it&#039;s output, hence so many messages would have to be sent before it gets flushed to the pipe. To test this you can do something like this:</p><p>shell #1<br /># logread -f | grep hello</p><p>shell #2<br /># while true; do logger hello; done</p><p>After a short time you should see bursts of lines with &quot;hello&quot; in it. I&#039;m not sure if there is a way to force logread not to buffer it&#039;s output. It will eventually get to your program, but probably not as fast as you would like when it&#039;s buffered. The reason you see it immediately when just typing &quot;logread&quot; is because it closes the file handle (stdout) when the command output is complete which causes the buffer to be flushed.</p>									</div>

					<p>I just looked at the source for logread (which is actually part of busybox) and it appears that there *is* an &quot;fflush(stdout)&quot; in the code, but only if it was compiled with &quot;CONFIG_FEATURE_LOGREAD_REDUCED_LOCKING&quot; defined. I&#039;m guessing that the one compiled for OpenWRT must not have had that config option set. I&#039;m not entirely sure that will solve the problem though but I think it might. At least that should be the general area that would need attention. Here&#039;s the source (it&#039;s very short):</p><p><a href="http://www.busybox.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/trunk/busybox/sysklogd/logread.c?rev=8630&amp;view=auto">http://www.busybox.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs. â€¦ ;view=auto</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Yep, I just defined that config option and rebuilt busybox and tested it on my WRT and now if I &quot;logread -f | grep hello&quot; and send a single hello to the log with logger it immediately displays (well, within 1 or 2 seconds). To enable this in your build root edit this file:</p><p>build_mipsel/busybox-1.00/include/config.h</p><p>Change this line:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#undef CONFIG_FEATURE_LOGREAD_REDUCED_LOCKING</code></pre></div><p>to this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#define CONFIG_FEATURE_LOGREAD_REDUCED_LOCKING 1</code></pre></div><p>Then build your image. I wonder if there is a specific reason for not enabling this? If not I wonder how hard it would be to get it into RC4?</p>									</div>

					<p>Ohh, that actually makes sense. I&#039;ll try compile a new image... too bad I don&#039;t currently have a linux desktop, but I&#039;ll try to get my hands on one. I just don&#039;t want to try anything weird with production servers :P</p><p>I&#039;ll post my blacklisting script on the forums if I get it done some day. The #1 priority feature will be port scan detection, cause I don&#039;t want anyone to find my servers by scanning.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
