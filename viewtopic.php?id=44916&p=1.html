					<p>How many topic talk about people that aren&#039;t able to set the max wifi tx power to 501 mW (27 db)? a big number..<br />In the large part of these cases the problem is due to an hardware limit of the router. So, someone know or have a direct experience with some router running OpenWrt that support the max tx power?<br />Maybe usefull to do a list, just for ones that want to use it as wifi repeater or very long wifi link. :-) I&#039;ll keep updated this first post.

					<p>I have this router, but I don&#039;t know how to measure it. Openwrt has limits, because it obeys regulatory rules, but I have seen jow&#039;s hack, which unleashes the power this router has, it is for atheros chipsets, so maybe applicable for different brands too. I have not tested the hack yet, bercause I don&#039;t want to attract attention by poisoning the air with my wifi only, when it works within rules just fine.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks nozombian for answer. </p><p>I don&#039;t think that you create a &quot;black hole&quot; if you put wifi at top power ;-) , above all if you use it with Yagi antenna for long link as supposed in this topic.</p><p>Anyway i think that if someone in wiki wrote &quot;Wireless Power:&nbsp; &nbsp; Maximal power output is 27 dBm (500 mW)&quot; maybe that you can check it without doing hack, with &quot;iw&quot; or &quot;iwlist txpower&quot; command via SSH. If you can, please try.</p><p>I found also this topic <a href="http://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=3032">http://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/vi … amp;t=3032</a> about this router but i haven&#039;t seen any hack in the german page, just setting US country in wifi option. Have you got a link for jow&#039;s hack? <br />I have a TP-LINK WR842ND (not so different, but i think that hardware doesn&#039;t support 502 mW of tx power..hoping to be wrong).</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanx for info, but don&#039;t worry you don&#039;t kill anyone with a router in an-plen-air and high directional antenna..</p><p>I&#039;ve a TP-LINK WR842ND (two antennas, 300M, ..) and testing with IT country i can max set 100 mW (20 dBm). Instead using US country i can set effective max 125 dBm (21 dB) but the top option is 501 mW.

					<p>I told you that I don&#039;t worry, 2W used by any cell phone at nearly the same frequency has 4x more output power than any router is capable <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>It is really possible to make 30km link on 2.4 GHz, we used em 10 years ago in here, but now it is problem to make a reliable and fast connection to a neighbour living across the street, 2.4GHz and 5GHz wifi bands are very noisy in here <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> I&#039;d not buy that tp-link antenna, it is better (and maybe even cheaper) to buy nanostation or nanobridge for this purpose.</p><p>Of course, that you have to &quot;see&quot; the other side, but for that long distance I&#039;d recommend using 5GHz nanobridges with 25dBi antenna, or better yet some system for long distance links, we use alcoma systems here (<a href="http://www.alcoma.com">www.alcoma.com</a>), they are much better than nanostations, but also much more expensive.</p><p>Btw. nanostations has &quot;compliance test&quot; in country setting, which will enable you to use frequencies outside the band and 27dBm output power. Of course, such setting would violate rules and cause intefrence with radars, military systems, aircrafts, or God knows what, but nanostation M5 allows me to choose between 4920-6100MHz <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> Legally is the band much more narrow, depending on the country.</p>									</div>

					<p>Nanostation M5 has 15V power supply from stock and works with 12V just fine. It may depend on the length of the cable, but if you have short ethernet cable such as 10 meters from poe, it is not a problem.</p><p>Btw it is possible to install openwrt on nanostations too, but ubnt firmware is more stable, does not have bugs with wifi, which openwrt has on atheros and ubnt has all features you need on a wifi bridge, plus you can select nonstandart frequencies, which is not possible on openwrt (maybe with hack, but I don&#039;t know).</p><p>I have routers by hand, but I don;t have luci installed.

					<p>Openwrt follows regulations, Bolivia probably hasn&#039;t limits for 2.4GHz band, that&#039;s why you can set bigger limit for that country. I tried to set 27 dBm with BO on my wr842nd too and it works too (have it compiled with Force Atheros drivers to respect the user&#039;s regdomain settings).

					<p>Thanx for testing!<br />Anyway there is something that is wrong because after reboot TX effective power was still at 21 dBm.

When i have much more time i&#039;ll try to test with some low cost instrument if there is real increase from 21 dBm to 27 (virtual) dBm.<br />I&#039;m updating first post with this two device. :-)<br />Anyway nanobridge must be more powerfull for long link.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, nanobridge is powerful. It allows you to go way beyond limits, has a big antenna and no loss in the cable, because board is connected directly. I know about nanobridge link, which works even through a forest without visibility and they are about 1km distant.

					<p>A few weeks back I went up a local hill about 9 miles from my town to play with a TP Link 702n. I had with me a laptop and 18 inch satellite dish with an adjustable cardboard support to hold the 702 at the focal point and a 12 inch square 30 degree horn made out of cardboard and AL foil feeding a 4 and 1/4 inch square waveguide that I could mount the 702 a quarter wavelength from the reflector at the end of the guide. With just the 702 I could see two weak signals from town--one of them near the hill&#039;s base. With the 18 inch dish I was seeing 10 or more signals often 5 to 15 dB strength and with the horn about the same. The dish was hard to setup and aim. The horn easy to play with but kind of big. Seemed to me that any signal I saw was likely to be from an outdoor mounted device or from one that just happened to have a window in just the right place to leak out the signal.</p><p>As the 702 is rated at 100mW and the calculated dish gain is 20dB at 2.4GHz, the effective power in the direction the dish was pointed was 10W. Don&#039;t know why one would play with making a high powered omnidirectional router when a low powered, small one can be&nbsp; mounted in a directional structure.</p><p>At 5GHz you can buy directional antennas built in and it is a better band than 2.4 for long distance use--though doing so would have some problems on a long term basis</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jvvh5897</strong> on 23 Jul 2013, 17:53)</p>

					<p>Ohps. Should have adjusted that effective output power for the amount that the dish intercepts.

I had with me a laptop and 18 inch satellite dish with an adjustable cardboard support to hold the 702 at the focal point and a 12 inch square 30 degree horn made out of cardboard and AL foil feeding a 4 and 1/4 inch square waveguide that I could mount the 702 a quarter wavelength from the reflector at the end of the guide. With just the 702 I could see two weak signals from town--one of them near the hill&#039;s base. With the 18 inch dish I was seeing 10 or more signals often 5 to 15 dB strength and with the horn about the same. The dish was hard to setup and aim. The horn easy to play with but kind of big. Seemed to me that any signal I saw was likely to be from an outdoor mounted device or from one that just happened to have a window in just the right place to leak out the signal.</p><p>As the 702 is rated at 100mW and the calculated dish gain is 20dB at 2.4GHz, the effective power in the direction the dish was pointed was 10W.

You are right when you say &quot;Don&#039;t know why one would play with making a high powered omnidirectional router when a low powered, small one can be&nbsp; mounted in a directional structure&quot; but here i was in search of a router to connect a RP-SMA YAGI antenna! Not for the omni! Anyway also 5 GHz would be interesting..but i don&#039;t know if i can use openwrt on them.</p>									</div>

					<p>Just because you can set those powers does not mean it is actually capable of them. Those are the regulatory limits not the limits of the router.</p><p>I&#039;ve seen plenty of routers where I have inspected the hardware and seen it is only capable of 19-2dBm and yet dodgy drivers will happily report 30dBm all the time.</p>									</div>
