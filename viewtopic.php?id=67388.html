					<p>I read and followed the wiki for Client PPTP form openWRT CC 15.01 with no kind of issues during setup. At the end of configuration I checked from an SSH terminal if connection was successful by pinging an IP address in the remote destination LAN and it works perfectly. That is not the same form my local lan. If I ping the tunnel endpoint IP the WRT box replies in about one ms but if I try to ping a remote IP (the same tried from the SSH terminal) I get something like:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>C:\Users\lucap_000&gt;ping 192.168.1.100

Esecuzione di Ping 192.168.1.100 con 32 byte di dati:
Richiesta scaduta. &lt;-- this means &quot;Request timed out&quot;
Risposta da 192.168.1.100: byte=32 durata=34ms TTL=126
Richiesta scaduta.
Risposta da 192.168.1.100: byte=32 durata=33ms TTL=126

Statistiche Ping per 192.168.1.100:
    Pacchetti: Trasmessi = 4, Ricevuti = 2,
    Persi = 2 (50% persi),
Tempo approssimativo percorsi andata/ritorno in millisecondi:
    Minimo = 33ms, Massimo =  34ms, Medio =  33ms</code></pre></div><p>As you can see 33~34 ms latency is pretty good and it&#039;s exactly what I expected but some packets seem to be lost.<br />As I already said the same ping works like a charm from the SSH. The remote PPTP gateway is 192.168.1.1, and local subnet is different (172.24.0.0). I also tried connecting to another PPTP server and the behavior is the same, but also the two PPTP servers are identical in hardware and software (not WRT boxes). Connecting the PPTP tunnel from inside the lan works well.</p><p>Any ideas?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>LuKePicci</strong> on 5 Sep 2016, 23:39)</p>
