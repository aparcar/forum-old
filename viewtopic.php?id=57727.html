					<p>I have got too many routers laying around. Is anyone interested in a WRT350N v2? I once bought it because it has buttons and USB, which made it nice to play with. Having a button for HDD spin-down was quite convenient.<br />Anyway, I would at least want a bar of chocolate for it. Shipment is from the Netherlands, pick-up is possible in Leiden or Amsterdam.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jouke</strong> on 1 Jun 2015, 22:38)</p>

					<p>hi jouke, how much is a bar of chocolate plus shipping to the Philippines would cost me? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Probably about 35 euros plus two weeks of waiting.<br />I&#039;ve got some <a href="http://link.marktplaats.nl/m934219662">pictures</a>. Do note that one of the antenna hinges is held together with a cable tie. This works beautifully though and is of no significant consequence.</p>									</div>
