					<p>Hello,</p><p>Problem:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am running Kamakazi 7.09 brcm-2.4.

I don&#039;t typically know what the source address is going to be on the private network (unless I want to create rules for the 500 potential addresses behind the firewall).</p><p>Other Software Installed</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have installed all of the nat modules and extentions.</p><p>What this problem is not</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is not openwrt to cisco VPN connections</p><p>What this problem is</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cisco VPN Client pass-through</p><p>Yes, I have read the FAQ, the wiki documentation, and this post.
