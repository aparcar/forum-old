					<p>Hello everyone! I´m a begginer in OpenWrt, this wonderful and powerful firmware.<br />I have a TP-Link wr-740n v4.25 running OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05 and I need to configure 4 VLan´s, one for each port (WAN is not in use). <br />1 - VLan 1 =&gt;IP 192.168.1.1, VLan 2 =&gt;IP 192.168.1.2, VLan 3 =&gt;IP 192.168.1.3, VLan 4 =&gt;IP 192.168.1.4.<br />2 - Netmask 255.0.0.0 .<br />3 - All VLan´s are fixed, in the same subnet, same ip range, but one VLan must be isolated from each other.<br />4 - I need to &quot;ping&quot; to all VLan´s from 4 network segments at the same time.</p><p>Is that possible ?</p><p>I tried to configure my router as discribed, but the way I´m doing, I can ping only to VLan 1.<br />In the &quot;Switch&quot; session, All VLan´s are as tagged and the port assigned to that VLan is as untagged.</p><p>Since now, I really thank all.</p>									</div>

					<p>I did as before. I´ve created 4 VLan´s, each one attached to one switch´s port. I don´t know how to manipulate iptables. The problem is: when I´m plugged on port 1, I can ping to that port, when I´m plugged to port 2, 3 or 4, I lost comunication to the switch. I can comunicate again only if I disable the others VLan´s. In Firewall section, Traffic Rules, can I do these settings, to stop vlan comunicating to others VLans´s ?</p>									</div>

Vlans are layer 2 (Mac address layer).</p><p>Vlans only create broadcast domains. Example -- Floor 2 doesn&#039;t want the people on Floor 3 to see the PRINTER on floor 2. Create Vlan2 for all the ports on floor 2 and&nbsp; create Vlan3 for all the ports on floor 3.</p><p>This configuration will keep the printer&#039;s broadcasts on floor 2 from reaching the users on floor 3. However, users on floor 3 can still print to floor 2, but only if they know the IP address of the printer on floor 2 ahead of time.</p><p>Vlans don&#039;t keep anyone from reaching other Vlans (If there&#039;s a router connected to the switches),only the broadcasts. So, to keep floor 2 printer from being accessed by floor 3, you need to implement a ACL (Access Control List) or in OpenWrt&#039;s case IP tables. </p><p>So, if you can&#039;t ping IP addresses on other vlans, there&#039;s another reason I.E. route issue.</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davidc502</strong> on 28 Dec 2015, 18:10)</p>

Then IPtables can be used to control access between these subnets.</p><p>OR, if the requirement is actually four IPs on the device in the same subnet (and so VLAN) then sub interfaces are needed instead of VLANs, some general info here: <a href="http://blog.marquis.co/adding-sub-interfaces-and-ip-addresses-on-ubuntu-14-04lts/">http://blog.marquis.co/adding-sub-inter … -14-04lts/</a> (I&#039;m not sure if this will work on OpenWRT but I think there is a good chance it will).</p><p>Going back to the VLAN configuration, you might also need to define a MAC address for each VLAN interface as some consumer-grade gear implements only shared-VLAN-learning capabilities (i.e. MAC addresses are unique globally rather than per VID).</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>									</div>

					<p>I´ve tried to implement 4 sub interfaces, but I need to attach the VLan1 to ether1 and I have the same result.<br />Unless I´m doing wrong. Can anyone describe how to create a sub interface and attach it to a single port of the router ? The only way to do this, after a research I made, is create a VLan, (CPU=Tagged, Port 1=Untagged) Create a Interface Ether1 and attach VLan1 to that interface. Am I right ? Please, Help. I tried to Switch the protocol to PPPOE, cause my DHCP server is /32, to each VLan and i´ve got the same result. I don´t know what to do.</p>									</div>
