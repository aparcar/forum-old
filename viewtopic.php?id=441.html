					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am wondering if there is any size limitation on what can be put into the firmware image. In other words, can I contineously grow the rootfs size ?</p><p>I understand that the flash is sort of &#039;sliced&#039; with one slice for the kernel + rootfs, one for the jffs2 and a fixed nvram area. Just don&#039;t know if the area for &quot;kernel+rootfs&quot; is fixed or can grow into jfffs2 area ?</p>									</div>

					<p>After going through the setup.c code, I think this is a bad idea.</p><p>Since the jffs2 is dynamically calculated, there may be some slack which allows the kernel+rootfs to shrink and grow but once it goes over that slack, all things would go weird as the supposed jffs2 partition would point to a wrong location</p><p>So this bring me to another question :</p><p>once I have installed openwrt and created jffs2 partition, it is in general not a good idea to use any firmware that can be significantly different in size than what I have flashed into it. </p><p>A possible scenario :</p><p>I have built and flash with the stock openwrt configuration. Now a while later I find that I need to include more applet in busybox(say to support openswan) and this make the rootfs grows to a size larger than the unused slack(64k block +/- something), my old jffs2 partition would have been trashed on my next upload as the superblock is now written.</p><p>Do I make sense ? If yes, I believe this should be documented in the user guide.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have reread the init script, It seems that under this situation, the firstboot would be rerun automatically. </p><p>So overall, the process is still fine, just that for those upgrading this way may find it odd that their previous setup(packages etc.) that was there in jffs2 before the &#039;upgrade&#039; would have mysteriously gone. The box becomes a brand new bare openwrt one. This does not limit to grow but shrink as well.</p>									</div>

					<p>To avoid reinstalling all the packages and the setups after a firstboot I use a NFS-mounted directory for a tar backup of the jffs2-Files. After a firstboot I load via wget the backup and reinstall everything.</p><p>This even allows to swap among different setups, forcing a firstboot out of failsafe mode and after a reboot loading the propper backup.</p><p>Greetings,<br />Stefan</p>									</div>

					<p>that is what I am planning to do too, thanks for the idea.</p><p>Though I am still thinking about cases like, what if my first firmware doesn&#039;t have say dropbear and install it to jffs2&nbsp; but later add that to the firmware because I feel that it is stable enough. As putting it in squashfs has a size advantage over jffs2. If I just tarball the old one and back, I would have two copy of it which would net out my initial intention.</p>									</div>
