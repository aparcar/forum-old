					<p>Hey from the UK.</p><p>I am having some real trouble picking a router to buy (my last one was a lemon and is going int he bin ASAP)</p><p>I need<br />1. DSL (ADSL ADSL2 - UK)<br />2. wifi (With WPA2)<br />3. a MIN of 2 ethernet ports (any more is a big plus)<br />4. something which openwrt is not going to just dump/give up on over night</p><p>I need all of the above, i need a fully working package. <br />I turn to openwrt for this! (I can not understand how all these main stream companies push out so much complete rubbish and openwrt can blow them away!)</p><p>I find the wiki very very hard to navigate, i have spent countless hours (Over the last few years!) browsing it in the hopes to find something suitable.</p><p>Our setup consists of about 5 wireless clients and currently 2 wired clients.</p><p>I am willing to listen to all options!</p><p>Please if you reply, reply with<br />1. Suggested router model<br />2. Confirm adsl + wpa2 wifi works<br />3. Why you think i should pick it over X Y or indeed Z<br />4. Downsides/upsides</p><p>Thanks guys, hopefully i will be on openwrt by the end of the week!</p>									</div>

					<p>The problem is that an AR7 based router is probably your only option, but the wifi on AR7 routers is based on a TNETWxxxx chip that uses the acx driver.&nbsp; It&#039;s not in the vanilla kernel, and the last time I tried it it either did not work at all, or it crashed the router requiring a power cycle.&nbsp; It was a while ago, so I&#039;m sure they have made lots of progress.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure it works in anything but client mode, though.</p><p>You&#039;re probably better off getting a cheap ADSL modem and a separate Wifi router supported by OpenWrt.&nbsp; Set up the OpenWrt router to connect through the ADSL modem using PPPoE.</p><p>(Just my opinion.)</p>									</div>

					<p>thank you for spelling that out to me, i was not able to gather that info from the wiki alone!</p><p>So no adsl + wifi for me.</p><br /><p>I think i will get something stand alone for wifi then, perhaps a new topic is needed.</p><p>What i now need:<br />1. wifi (With WPA2)<br />2. something which openwrt is not going to just dump/give up on over night<br />3. low power if possible?</p><br /><p>Is fon going to be my cheapest choice now?</p>									</div>
