					<p>Hi,</p><p>The vnStat package available in OpenWRT is version 1.12. The most recent (stable) version is 1.15. So the first thing to do would be to update it so bug fixed could be introduced.</p><p>The second thing is wrong default configuration available in package for OpenWRT. The values:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># how often (in seconds) interface data is updated
UpdateInterval 60

# how often (in seconds) interface status changes are checked
PollInterval 30</code></pre></div><p>Should be much lower. Because of them being so high there is an issue where 4GB (or more) of data is added to statistic which makes the whole package useless because you can&#039;t really trust the statistic you see. The developer of vnStat said:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>The default value for UpdateInterval is actually 30. If you had it at 60 then the default has most likely been modified in OpenWRT for some reason. 60 is anyway too high when a 1 Gbit interface with 32-bit kernel is used as the interface can transfer 4 GB in less than that time. If you want to be on the safe side, you should lower the value to say for example 15.</p></blockquote></div><p>You can read more about the issue I&#039;m talking about here:<br /><a href="https://github.com/vergoh/vnstat/issues/40">https://github.com/vergoh/vnstat/issues/40</a></p><p>Here is the link to the default vnStat configuration file.<br /><a href="https://github.com/vergoh/vnstat/blob/master/cfg/vnstat.conf">https://github.com/vergoh/vnstat/blob/m â€¦ nstat.conf</a></p><p>To summarise. I would ask OpenWRT developers or whoever is maintaining the vnStat package to update it to the current version and reset the default config file to values recommended by developer of the package or even maybe set it to lower values as recommended in the quote above.</p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>
