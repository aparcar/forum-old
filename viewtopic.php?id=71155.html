					<p>The problem is compiling a kernel and other binaries to run on the Lexra core in the Realtek CPU. <br />A couple of recent threads about it in the Hardware Hacking subforum. Mainstream Linux has shunned the Lexra as it is a crippled machine and for a compiler to work around those missing instructions is difficult.</p>									</div>

					<p>at first thank you mk24<br />second i didn&#039;t understand a word form that i am a web developer with<br />some experience with c ,c# ,c++ ,vb Linux</p><p>so that bin file i mention is the firmware from my isp i flashed it from the web interface and it worked i just want to edit that part about<br />TR-069 and then recreating the bin file i am not taring to make it supported by openwrt<br />i just post it here because as i said when i extract bin file from openwrt the files were close names and folders and extensions<br />some of them where without any extions i didn&#039;t understand any of it even in the url at 192.168.1.1 the files look&nbsp; dot html but there is not a single html file at the extracted files i was hoping that you would complete what i am missing here for my area of expert as a web developer and give me a tools or something like binwalk to edit those files and built it<br />just like you edit openwrt bin files not form the command in the web interface you get what i mean<br />and again thank you for your help</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenWrt&#039;s philosophy is to have the source code for everything, change it where needed, then compile a complete new bin image from scratch.&nbsp; So we seldom if ever try to dig through bins and modify them.</p>									</div>

					<p>The bottom line is that this is the wrong forum to ask the question you are asking.&nbsp; </p><p>Yes, what you are wanting to do-- hack a factory firmware to disable or remove the TR-069 client-- is likely possible, but it is something well outside the scope of OpenWrt development or usage.&nbsp; As an OpenWrt user and very light developer, I have no experience hacking factory firmware so I can&#039;t help you there.</p><p>I do know that OpenWrt does not contain any .html files because all the pages the user sees from its web interface are dynamically generated by LUA scripts. LUA is a lot like PHP but smaller. Most other router firmware likely does a similar thing but in a completely different way.</p>									</div>
