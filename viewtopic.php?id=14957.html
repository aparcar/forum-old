					<p>Hello,</p><p>&nbsp; I&#039;ve spent a lot of time looking over posts, documentation, etc. and I can&#039;t seem to find anything current about compiling OpenWrt for the Mikrotik RB1xx line.&nbsp; Sure, there is plenty of *old* information; most of it (like <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Mikrotik/RB100)">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har … tik/RB100)</a> revolves around compiling an old svn release with the ADM5120 target.&nbsp; When I download a recent Kamikaze, I don&#039;t see any ADM5120 target at all - the closest looking thing is a RB5xx target that doesn&#039;t seem to run on the RB1xx.&nbsp; Has this been discontinued?&nbsp; What happened to the ADM5120 target?&nbsp; &nbsp;Why are most of the posts about this board from 2006?&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>&nbsp; Thanks much!</p><p>&nbsp; Joseph Sullivan<br />Alyrica Networks, Inc.</p>									</div>

					<p>Interesting.&nbsp; I just downloaded the latest svn release on my Ubuntu installation, and the ADM5120 target is magically there.&nbsp; When I tried compiling under Debian, it wasn&#039;t there.&nbsp; I wonder what I&#039;m missing.</p>									</div>

					<p>I too did not find support for the rb1xx in the 7.09 release of Kamikaze but it is in the latest SVN and works as advertised. I followed the directions at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Mikrotik/RB100">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har … otik/RB100</a> and it &quot;just worked&quot;. The only glitch I saw is that if I try to compile all of the packages some of them blow chunks. I finally gave up and just compiled the stuff that looked useful to me. I used the procedure at <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=9180">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=9180</a> to build KamiKaze, except I built it on a Fedora box and I did not dedicate a machine to it. I simply downloaded the svn into its own directory and followed the instructions to build. I must say I am impressed with the ease with which I was able to get this going.</p><p>Hope this helps,</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Tom</p>									</div>

					<p>When I tried it last, which was a couple of months ago, you had to enable experimental targets (I can&#039;t remember what the actual option is called.)</p><p>Just checked the Wiki and it&#039;s the &quot;Show broken platforms / packages&quot; option.&nbsp; I should have remembered, since I added that bit to the Wiki <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>This was on Debian and I had no problems building it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah, I enabled experimental targets, but it still didn&#039;t show up.&nbsp; This was using the Kamikaze release.&nbsp; When I downloaded a svn snapshot, make menuconfig wouldn&#039;t even show a target selection menu.&nbsp; Crazy.&nbsp; Everything worked fine on Ubuntu.&nbsp; I had to force it on Debian, however, since I was running GCC 3.80 instead of the required 3.81.&nbsp; Perhaps that caused it...</p>									</div>

					<p>It seems support for the RB1xx family of Mikrotik boards is back, the target is selected normally through make menuconfig. You no longer have to enable &quot;Show broken platforms/packages.&quot;</p><p>Rob</p>									</div>
