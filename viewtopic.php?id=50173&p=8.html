					<p>I understand this post can be seen as offtopic, but I am willing to get some attention.<br />Who on earth is in charge for OpenWRT.ORG home page?<br />It&#039;s really disturbing to see those 3 years old &quot;Headlines&quot;, the &quot;Documentation&quot; link under &quot;Latest release&quot; section pointing to Kamikaze while the Documentation link in the headline points to the Wiki.<br />I already raised this point <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=43569">at least</a> <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39819">twice</a> in the past.

					<p>Ah okay. There was a commit on May 6th marked &quot;v4.3_rc&quot; and when I compared it against the OpenWRT r40006 it didn&#039;t seem too off (Though I only did a quick compare, didn&#039;t look too far into it).

    mtd: add support for bad blocks in NAND flash

    NAND flash is very likely to contain bad blocks.

    Currently, mtd and therefore sysupgrade fails when it encounters a single bad block, potentially leaving an unbootable system.

    This patch allows the mtd utility to skip bad blocks in NAND flash and complete sysupgrade successfully.</code></pre></div><div class="codebox"><pre><code>nand_read_bbt: Bad block at 0x000003820000</code></pre></div><p>So far it looks good-- wifi does come up but haven&#039;t tested much yet to see if the disconnect is still there.</p>									</div>

It&#039;s probably going to be quite a while before we see base support for the WRT1900AC built into OpenWRT itself.
