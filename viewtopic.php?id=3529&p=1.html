					<p>This pulled from the Linksys Press Release Page:</p><br /><p>New Products From Linksys Address Hot Networking Trends</p><p>Products unveiled at International CES 2006 include Wireless-G Audio Bridge, Wireless-G Compact Internet Camera, and Wireless-G Broadband Router with Network Attached Storage Functionality</p><p>LAS VEGAS - JANUARY 4, 2006 - Today at the 2006 International Consumer Electronics Show, Linksys®, a Division of Cisco Systems, Inc., the recognized leading provider of voice, wireless and networking hardware for the consumer, Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) and small business customer, debuted three products that address some of the hottest trends in networking: streaming audio, network storage and security.</p><p>“Networking trends are driven by the capability of emerging technologies,” said Mani Dhillon, director, product marketing, Linksys. “The landscape of the market clearly shows that network storage, security, and streaming audio are key topics of interest for consumers and the products we are announcing this week address these areas.”</p><p>Streaming Audio<br />In a recent survey conducted by research firm In-Stat, more than sixty percent of respondents expressed that they were at least somewhat interested in connecting their PC to a stereo system to listen to digital audio files . The Wireless-G Music Bridge (WMB54G) enables these respondents to wirelessly transfer PC audio output to a stereo or other speaker system located anywhere within the home.</p><p>A key differentiator of the Linksys Wireless-G Music Bridge is that users are not tied to using a particular music service to move music around their homes. Any sound that can be played by the existing speakers on a PC can be wirelessly streamed using the WMB54G. The product works as a virtual sound card that connects to a stereo or speaker system via traditional audio cables or optical digital connectors to maximize the ability of existing surround sound equipment.</p><p>Networked Storage<br />Research firm Parks Associates predicts that the number of U.S. households with a networked storage device will grow from 300,000 at the end of 2004 to nearly 10 million by 2010. To address this growing desire for networked storage capabilities, Linksys is introducing the Wireless-G Media Storage Link Router with Speed Booster (WRTSL54GS).</p><p>As an all-in-one Internet-sharing router, Wireless-G access point, and Network Storage Link, the WRT54SLGS enables users to connect USB disk drives directly to their network. SecureEasySetup functionality on the Wireless-G Media Storage Link Router makes creating a secure home network with networked attached storage push-button simple, and a built-in media server streams music, video, and photos located on a USB-attached storage device to any Universal Plug and Play-(UPnP) compatible media adapter. Storage devices attached to the WRTSL54GS can also be setup to be available publicly for download via a web browser or via password-protected accounts for authorized users.</p><p>Security<br />Security via surveillance is a key factor in driving the sales of network cameras that research firm In-Stat says will exceed those of analog cameras by 2007. The Linksys Compact Wireless-G Internet Video Camera (WVC54GC) wirelessly connects to a home or small office network and distributes a live video stream through the Internet to a web browser accessible on virtually any Windows-based PC, enabling users to easily monitor their most important assets.</p><p>Its unique form factor and wireless connectivity provide the flexibility to mount the WVC54GC on even the most remote wall or simply slip it into the included desktop stand for more local monitoring. An easy-to-remember name can be assigned to the WVC54GC through the SoloLink™ domain service from Linksys to ease the process of accessing recorded content. When its security mode is activated, the WVC54GC will send email alerts with video clips to up to three email addresses upon detecting motion within its field of view.</p><p>Pricing and Availability<br />Both the WRTSL54GS and WVC54GC are available now through Linksys e-commerce, retail, direct response, and VAR partners at estimated street prices (ESP) of $129.99. The WMB54G is available from e-commerce and direct response at an ESP of $99.99.</p><p>About Linksys<br />Founded in 1988, Linksys, a Division of Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO) is the recognized leader in Voice, Wireless and Ethernet networking hardware for consumer, SOHO and small business users.

					<p>Thanks Kaloz. Would this essentially be the generic brcom trx file with the header for an SL?</p><p>My lingering question is that I don&#039;t know if this BCM5325F ethernet switch chip&nbsp; is sufficiently like the 5325E noted in OpenWRT source. I&#039;ve been digging for information on the BCM5325F and not finding much about it so far. Indications in Linksys source that QoS and maybe ports are setup differently, an eth2 pops up in code several places.</p><p>If I brick it, would it still be usable by dev team as a donation?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 2 Feb 2006, 02:29)</p>

					<p>Well, mostly. I need to check the image of the SL.

Well, even if it works <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Drop me an email address in private, as I don&#039;t want to put the image up somewhere as long as it&#039;s not confirmed working.</p>									</div>
