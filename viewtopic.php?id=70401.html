					<p>vinc, what they are trying to tell you is that pretty much any single wan router (when flashed to openwrt) can be turned into a dual-WAN (or 3-WAN, 4-WAN) router.<br />You change a LAN port to a WAN port.<br />For example if you take the Tplink 1043ND, flash it with openwrt, you can change LAN4 to be WAN2 easily..<br />then install a package called mwan3, and loadbalance or failover the lines..</p>									</div>

					<p>While the answer above is pretty complete/accurate, I just wanted to add that router doesn&#039;t have to have two radios, there&#039;re single radio routers which can be set up for both WiFi as WAN (STA mode) and regular WiFi (AP mode) at the same time. Do check out travelmate package for that.</p>									</div>

					<p>Just to be sure I understood correctly:</p><p>I am assuming radios are also called band and dual band router have 2 radios (tri-band routers have 3). Correct?</p><p>You can configure one of the radio (originaly marketed as an Access Point) to be a Wifi client so that it can be used as Wifi as WAN.

					<p>Having two radios on the same band wouldn&#039;t increase speed much because when they are in the same box they will jam each other, even if on different channels.&nbsp; &nbsp;So there aren&#039;t any routers built with two separate 2.4 radios inside. </p><p>If you can use one band (e.g. 2.4) for the link to the ISP and put the users on the other band (5 GHz), that will improve speed.</p><p>When trying to pull from a far away AP it can be useful to plug in a USB wifi adapter with a directional antenna for that link, then use the router&#039;s built in radio as the local AP.</p>									</div>

					<p>Bonding requires a special setup by the ISP so you have several lines (usually DSL) that merge into one public IP on their end.&nbsp; </p><p>If the ISP does not offer bonding, you can still buy multiple conventional lines and load balance them.&nbsp; The difference is that it isn&#039;t possible to get more than the bandwidth of one line to any single connection.&nbsp; It is beneficial for multiple users though.</p>									</div>
