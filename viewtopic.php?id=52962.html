					<p>Hi All</p><p>I thought I&#039;d let people know about a package I&#039;ve release in case someone finds it useful. It&#039;s called Torfilter and is a plugin (with web interface) that lets you configure the routing of network traffic through Tor at the gateway rather than having to configure it per host.</p><p>My main aim was to allow the use of Tor for specific sites while leaving all other traffic to be routed normally. It also supports using Tor for all traffic from selected local IP ranges and network level access to .onion services. Torfilter can also be combined with Tors ability to exclude exit notes in specific countries to allow access to sites that are not available in your location.</p><p>You can download it here:<br /><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/torfilter/files/packages/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/torfil â€¦ /packages/</a></p><p>There is documentation available here:<br /><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/torfilter/wiki/Home/">https://sourceforge.net/p/torfilter/wiki/Home/</a></p><p>The package will install everything you need however you will have to manually configure Tor, there are instructions in the documentation of the settings that are required.</p><p>If anyone else finds it useful or has any ideas for improvements let me know.</p><p>Cheers,<br />John</p>									</div>
