					<p>Dear all,</p><p>I would like to hack the D-Link DGS-1210-10P series. I bought this hardware because it provides 8 nice Gigs ports and a Web GUI. And the vendor announced that it relies on GNU/Linux. So as a normal person, I thought &quot;Nice it is going to be supporte a LONG time&quot;.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www.dlink.com/-/media/Images/Products/DGS/1210/C1/DGS121010C1Image%20LFront.png?h=353&amp;w=628&amp;crop=1" alt="http://www.dlink.com/-/media/Images/Products/DGS/1210/C1/DGS121010C1Image%20LFront.png?h=353&amp;amp;w=628&amp;amp;crop=1" /></span></p><p>Also, all firmware source code is available on : <a href="http://tsd.dlink.com.tw">http://tsd.dlink.com.tw</a>. Souce code can be compiled using scipts and is provided by D-Link. It includes the Linux kernel and all configuration files. There is even a makefile provided (but no .config).</p><p>The source code for my model is DGS-1210-10P here :<br /><a href="https://dlink-gpl.s3.amazonaws.com/GPL1200117/DGS-1210-10P-GPLSourceCode.tar.gz">https://dlink-gpl.s3.amazonaws.com/GPL1 … ode.tar.gz</a></p><p>Unfortunately, hardware revisions A1, A2, B1, C1 and D1 are not compatible. D-Link no longer releases firmware for hardware revision A1. I am using the oldest revision A1 which was compiled in Oct 02, 2012 WITHOUT ipv6 support. IPv6 Launch began on 6 June 2012. </p><p>Now I am stuck with 3 of those nice switches without IPV6.</p><p>I am very interested in debricking those firewalls and compiling OpenWRT.<br />Any idea if OpenWrt can run on those switches?</p><p>I wonder what stops D-Link from providing IPv6 switches with updated firmwares. These are REALLY nice switches and I need bending edge software running on it. The first step would be to locate the console to unbrick it.</p><p>Kind regards,<br />Gnultella</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gnutella</strong> on 13 Mar 2015, 18:42)</p>

					<p>I found some building information:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Install &amp; Build
===============
    1. Build Environment: 
        1.1 Red Hat 9, Fedora core 3, fully install.
        1.2 you can open Terminal for using command line.

    2. Put &quot;DGS-1210-10P-GPLSourceCode.tar.gz&quot; under /home and using command &quot;tar -zxvf DGS-1210-10P-GPLSourceCode.tar.gz&quot; to untar it.
    
    3. Prepare for toolchain:
        Copy /home/DGS-1210-10P/toolchain/devtools_0824.tar.gz to /opt folder and using command &quot;tar -zxvf devtools_0824.tar.gz&quot; to untar it.
       
    4. Prepare for SourceCode:
       In os folder and using command &quot;tar -zxvf linux-2.6.22.18.tar.gz&quot; to untar it.
    
    5. Add yourself to the sudo list
        Edit &quot;/etc/sudoers&quot; to add your account to the sudoers.
        For example :
        user    ALL=(ALL)    NOPASSWD: ALL 
        
        This action is only allowed by super user, and the file &quot;sudoers&quot; is read-only.
        You must login in super user and change the file permission.
        Remember to change file permission back to 440 by command &quot;chmod 440 /etc/sudoers&quot;.

    
    6. In /home/DGS-1210-10P/ Then type &quot;make GPLos&quot;
    
    7. After building finished, you can find /home/DGS-1210-10P/image folder and firmware(&quot;DGS-1210-10P-OS.hex&quot;).       </code></pre></div><p>the .config file, which is provided by D-Link.<br />It is available from the os/linux-2.6.22.18.tar.gz file inside GPL source code provided by D-Link.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#

					<p>Greetings and thank you for your enthusiasm. I can&#039;t speak in the name of the OpenWrt core team, but you will definitely need to complete the following steps to get meaningful response.</p><p>First create a new page at the OpenWrt wiki.<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/start">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/start</a></p><p>Upload all your photos and other information you have gathered about the device. Don&#039;t be afraid that the information looks too basic - every bit of information is valuable for others. Especially try to reverse engineer the internals. Gather exact chip case markings, memory sizes, chipsets, integrated peripherals. Possibly provide links to data sheets as well. Try to cross-link other OpenWrt pages based on chip and architecture similarity. Serial logs and executing some commands after logging in would also come in handy.</p><p>Based on that knowledge, a developer who recognizes the platform would be in the position to update the wiki page with support status or reason for ignorance. Do note that a negative result is a valuable result as well for the record, and devices could be revisited in the future by others.</p><p>Here&#039;s the standard procedure for reference:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/add.new.platform">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/add.new.platform</a></p><p>I recommend using the forum and mailing list for discussion and linking only. Information here is disorganized and quickly gets lost.</p>									</div>

Good work, it already stands out from the crowd of stubs!</p><p>I&#039;ve reviewed your photos, and tried to identify some of the chips. I&#039;ve listed the ones I could read out to the wiki. The markings are mostly overexposed or blurred, so you will either need to take another set of photos, or get a magnifying glass and type in as much model numbers as possible. It&#039;s also unfortunate that the most interesting components are under heat sinks, though the boot logs could tell us more.</p><p>CON2 is a good candidate for a serial console. I don&#039;t understand your wiki comments about it. Did you try to measure voltage levels? I would expect it to be 3.3V and a simple common USB-TTL would interface it. Also include JP3 in your search, as they sometimes break serial connections, though mostly with resistor pads and not jumpers. Just for laughs: <a href="http://bkil.blogspot.com/2015/02/841n-serial-unbricking-with-needles.html">http://bkil.blogspot.com/2015/02/841n-s … edles.html</a></p><p>I found a relevant, though not very helpful thread that you may still find interesting:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=49051">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=49051</a></p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve extended the wiki a bit further.</p><p>It would require some manual labor to validate, however I have a feeling that all DGS-1210-* A1 (B1?) devices will have mostly the same architecture, while all C1 devices will have a separate core, etc. Anyhow, if this is a case, it would be a good idea to keep only a very short introduction and a table of links at the main DGS-1210 wiki page, and create separate pages as per the findings. I&#039;m not sure about the allowed character set in a page name, but a naming scheme like dgs-1210_rev_a1_b1 and dgs-1210_rev_c1 could be an option. If the general architecture remains the same between given models, while only some slight parameters differ (like GPIO layout or RAM size), then a combined page does make sense.</p><p>Such revision differentiation has happened many times in the past, and the later it is done, the more messy the resulting wiki pages become, see for example [toh:d-link:dir-300], [toh:d-link:dir-300revb], [toh:d-link:dir-300revb5], ... People usually try to grow a page organically as in the beast at [toh:tp-link:tl-wr740n]. However, if you think about it, there ain&#039;t anything common between the similarly named revisions which would warrant a combined summary of information. Internal pictures, serial pinout, pull-ups, chip markings, quirks and features all differ tremendously. It instead creates confusion for newcomers.</p><p>Don&#039;t get me wrong: there&#039;s nothing wrong with your actions and it&#039;s great that you upload everything as soon as you grab an extra piece of the puzzle. I&#039;m just considering taking up the mega-project of refactoring the whole OpenWrt wiki sooner or later, and I just want to spare you from doing extra work later on. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Keep up the good work, best regards!</p><p>P.S.: By the way, don&#039;t forget to experiment with pull-up, pull-down and current limiting resistors while probing for the serial port.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bkil</strong> on 16 Mar 2015, 21:29)</p>

					<p>Did you already have a go with this?<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/port.serial?s%5b%5d=probe#piezoelectric_buzzer_method">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/p … zer_method</a></p><p>You could look around how other similar Kirkwood boards hook up serial. From that it seems common to include a 2x5 pin pad for this purpose. However, 1x4, 1x5 or 1x6 pin header is also not unheard of. 115200 seems to be a common baud rate. Note that baud rate of the boot loader and the kernel sometimes differ.<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/seagate/dockstar?s%5b%5d=serial#serial">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/seagate/do … ial#serial</a><br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/_detail/toh/seagate/dockstar-board-stripped-caption.png?id=toh%3Aseagate%3Adockstar">https://wiki.openwrt.org/_detail/toh/se … 3Adockstar</a><br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/ea3500?s%5b%5d=serial#serial">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/ea … ial#serial</a></p><p>6.55V seems too much, and I hope you&#039;ve also measured around with a voltage meter. Though most ports do have latch up protection diodes, so experimentation should be relatively safe with series resistance.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure why port.serial misses the advice to try with 10k pull up (sometimes pull down) resistors. This has been mentioned several times at various sub pages. Some boards include some more tiny unsoldered components besides the connector which is needed for serial access. That&#039;s why you sometimes need the additional components.</p><p>Garbage can be caused by:<br />&nbsp; * no 3.3V pull up (or down) resistor on TX (most common)<br />&nbsp; * swapping GND and TX<br />&nbsp; * need a filtering capacitor<br />&nbsp; * not the right pins at all</p><p>After you&#039;ve inspected all (unsoldered) header candidates on both sides of the board, there&#039;s a remote possibility that no serial header exists at all. As a last resort, you need to start probing all possible pins of the processor via exposed pads and component leads. A pinout, though not mandatory, would really help here. Note that you could easily mess up the whole board in this process both directly and indirectly.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bkil</strong> on 17 Mar 2015, 13:26)</p>

					<p>As outlined in my linked post, it&#039;s completely normal and desirable to start with a read-only test. Have you verified your cable pinout? Did you test it with anything else? It sometimes happen that they mistakenly exchange RX and TX. It&#039;s very good that you did not connect the board VCC to the USB power.</p><p>The weak pull-up resistance is sometimes optionally needed between the board TX and the board 3.3V Vcc, however never connect the board Vcc or USB power to anywhere else!</p><p>I still feel that 6.6V is too much for a serial port.</p><p>Sorry for the bad link, I&#039;ll try to ask again whether you have tried the piezzo detection method:<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/port.serial?s%5b%5d=probe#piezoelectric_buzzer_method">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/p … zer_method</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bkil</strong> on 17 Mar 2015, 13:27)</p>

					<p>&gt; Have you verified your cable pinout?<br />Yes, I used a Raspberry Pie to make sure to locate cable RX (white) and cable TX (green).

One reason is that on revision C1 they implement an RSA serial console. It means Dlink engenneers are used to having a console.

Then I understood the process and started over with screen utility.

					<p>Don&#039;t get me wrong: if a board would not have serial pins, it could still very much be configured to use the CPU&#039;s pins for that. It&#039;s just that they would be inaccessible (or &quot;unfriendly&quot; as OpenWrt calls it). Then again, I have yet to see a capable board which misses such a simple and effective debugging aid.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure about the selection of piezzo buzzer, I just grabbed some for a few cents at a local store when I needed some. They are very tiny, imagine less than 1cm. They are sometimes soldered to computer motherboards and modems as PC speakers and other such places. You can also find them in wrist watches and some, but not all alarm clocks because they are low power. Are you sure you have none of these lying around at home?</p><p>I guess the wiki recommends such a speaker because it is relatively safe due to its high impedance and it is very loud for the minuscule amount of power a GPIO pin can supply. Such an element will make a sound if it gets enough bit transitions as per my musical experience with them. I have not tested a piezzo buzzer myself for serial ports, but I think no extra/built-in driver is necessary for such a use case.</p><p>edit: They do offer ones which have built-in frequency generation, but that variant would be less suitable in my opinion.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bkil</strong> on 18 Mar 2015, 00:35)</p>

					<p>The 6V pin is not a ttl, you were right. If I remove LED display, there is no longer&nbsp; a signal. So it is not a TTL. I will do further testing removing the LED display cables.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gnutella</strong> on 17 Mar 2015, 14:21)</p>

					<p>There&#039;s an old saying being attributed to Abraham Lincoln which goes “If I had six hours to chop down a tree, I’d spend the first four hours sharpening the axe.” </p><p>So I take that you did not find a buzzer? If you were nearby, I could give you a dozen from the junk... Then perhaps you have access to a digital scope, pulse counter, frequency estimator or signal analyzer of some sort? I made one from a microcontroller back in the days when debugging keyboard protocols. You might even find some software for a parallel port of you had a thorough look.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bkil</strong> on 18 Mar 2015, 10:31)</p>

					<p>By the way, if the boot loader is damaged, no serial output will be available. if all your serial efforts seem fruitless, you will need to consider moving to JTAG.<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.debrick#jtag">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.debrick#jtag</a><br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/port.jtag">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/port.jtag</a><br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/port.jtag.utilization">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/p … tilization</a></p><p>If JTAG can not be found or reverse engineered, or if it does not let you write to the flash, you will probably need to desolder the chips and flash them externally. A socket could come handy, though you still did not identify the used flash chip for example.</p><p>And of course this is all assuming that the boards are 100% healthy electronically. Faulty boards naturally sell for less. Possible defects in electronics and causes can be placed on a wide spectrum.</p><p>It would insure you against wasted effort to start from a 100% functioning board, observe the pin layouts, needed software and tricks, and then apply that knowledge to the non-functioning ones.</p>									</div>
