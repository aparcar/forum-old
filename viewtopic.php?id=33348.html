					<p>Is it possible to make an Initial Sign On page for the guest zone currently set up on my DIR-825. (Running Open WRT Backfire 10.03.1-rc6)</p><p>I know that lots of hotels do things like this (don&#039;t exactly know how)<br />but generally you connect to the router, are shown a web page with an agreement and then you have to click a button that says you accept the agreement/network use policy and<br />from then on you are allowed unlimited internet access.</p><p>Is this possible, and if it is could someone please describe the steps I would take to set it up?</p>									</div>

					<p>That looks like it will work.<br />Thank you very much.</p><p>Now I have more of a technical question (probably directed more to the people of no dog, but I&#039;ll ask here to see if anyone knows) how hard would it be to run a simultaneous web server off of port 80 while running nodogsplash</p>									</div>
