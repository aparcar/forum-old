					<p>Is it possible to combine a Backfire based router (e.g. TP-Link WR1043ND) with a managed switch VLAN ?</p><p>The managed switch e.g. an TP-LINK 8 +2G Gigabit Uplink Web Smart Switch Netzwerk should be connected to one of the routers ethernet ports.</p><p>Connections between evices coupled to the managed switch and devices coupled to the remaining ethernet ports of the router should be configured via OpenWRT VLAN capabilities ?</p><p>This would help my setup, where i currently have my router with one ethernet cable and a simple switch (in front of various clients).<br />Getting other cables from my router to the clients would be difficult. <br />But I want to separate the clients via VLANs.</p><p>Specific managed switch needed ? </p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Your question is, if one can nest VLAN-capable switches, and I do not think you can. You can only put one tag into a ip-packet and the switch will strip this. Would the ip-packet with the VLAN-Tag be forwarded if the switch didn&#039;t strip it?</p><p>Well, hmm, I do not know. Have you tried putting the Switch of the 1043 into no-VLAN mode? Make the ip-stack put VLAN-tag into the packets, but make the Switch ignore them.</p><br /><br /><p>Edit: Seems to be possible:&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://rpc.one.pl/images/stories/images/dynamic_vlan/hostapd_dynamic_vlan.jpg">http://rpc.one.pl/images/stories/images … c_vlan.jpg</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Orca</strong> on 30 Mar 2011, 13:59)</p>

					<p>Sure it&#039;s possible, you need to either use the managed switch port as a normal switch and not do any VLAN configuration on the OpenWRT device (since it will all be in one directed VLAN based on the port), or set the port to which your OpenWRT device is connected to be a &quot;trunk&quot; port, so that is recognizes and uses the 802.1q tagging that the OpenWRT device puts on the port.</p><p>See <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/networking/start#vlan.and.bridging.concepts">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/networking/ … g.concepts</a> (specifically the VLAN trunking section).</p>									</div>
