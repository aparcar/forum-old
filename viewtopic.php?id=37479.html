					<p>Hi,<br />I have a Asus RT-N16 and compiled backfire r32104 version from the trunk some month ago. Now I tried to install kmod-video*, but always got an error like:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>opkg install kmod-i2c-core

Downloading http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/brcm47xx/packages/kmod-i2c-core_3.3.8-1_brcm47xx.ipk.
Collected errors:
 * satisfy_dependencies_for: Cannot satisfy the following dependencies for kmod-i2c-core:

 * opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package kmod-i2c-core.</code></pre></div><p>So it looks like the packages are build for a newer kernel. Now I compiled the sources again and included the kmod-video* packages in the menuconfig, which resulted in some bin/brcm47xx/packages files that I copied to my router and tried to install them via</p><p>opkg install kmod-i2c-core_3.0.17-1_brcm47xx.ipk </p><p>and results in</p><p>Installing kmod-i2c-core (3.0.17-1) to root...<br />Collected errors:<br /> * satisfy_dependencies_for: Cannot satisfy the following dependencies for kmod-i2c-core:<br /> * &nbsp; &nbsp; kernel (= 3.0.17-1-36e550fab5fbfde66fa5dec6846ebcd2) * <br /> * opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package kmod-i2c-core.</p><p>So I didn&#039;t get any further? Can someone point me at a solution, or is it not possible to &quot;add&quot; kernel modules once you compiled?</p>									</div>

If you used exactly the same config and just enabled a module, you can try to force installing the package, if you enabled anything further it wont work. Why dont you create an image out of what you just compiled for your router?</p>									</div>

					<p>Since you compiled the module/kernel cleanly and together, you know they&#039;ll work. Just force the package to install; I do it frequently with kernel modules I compiled and SCP&#039;d over.</p>									</div>
