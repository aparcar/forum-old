					<p>Still very curious as to why some people have issues with upgrades. I switch between various builds, kernel versions, etc. all the time, with zero issues. There is no logical reason at all why switching between kernel versions would require a different upgrade procedure. The kernel part of flashing is just a simple erase/write regardless of which upgrade mechanism is used.</p><p>If anyone has such a failed upgrade and can report a (failed) boot log from serial and a log of sysupgrade&#039;s output, I would greatly appreciate it.</p><p>The only problematic upgrade I can think of is McWRT to mainline OpenWrt trying to use a sysupgrade tar file.

Aside from that particular case, I have not been able to get it to fail.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>leitec</strong> on 3 Apr 2015, 23:31)</p>

(edit: done)</p><p>I also thought of another issue specific to switching between 3.18 and 4.0, which is that the wifi might not come up with the same configuration. I think the reason is the path as defined in /etc/config/wireless is slightly different, so &quot;wifi detect&quot; will think there are two new adapters. Although that&#039;s not really bricking the device, if somebody was trying to use only wireless that could be interpreted as such.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>leitec</strong> on 4 Apr 2015, 00:29)</p>

					<p>i just picked up a wrt1900ac and well and of course after the first firmware flash failed, i ended up getting a serial cable and going through all that. i seem to be picking up the device pretty well but in all honestly at a loss on the images and kernel builds. i am a network engineer by trade and a &quot;wanna-be&quot; programmer, and a poor one at that. would someone be willing to give me a eli5 break down of what my best options are for this router? i see a lot of people are having custom packages built for them, and would love to be able to do my own but i just don&#039;t have the know how on that yet. basically what i am looking for is stability, stability, stability. that along with obviously solid wifi performance, possibly some routing protocols (ospf, maaaaaybe bgp just for honkin around), nfs storage would be great (yes, nfs not ntfs), tcpdump is a must, and possibly afp / appletalk / bonjour file sharing, ohhh and bandwidth tuning (being able to throttle certain wireless networks). i would have thought most of this stuff would have been available via packages but as someone else alluded to, not everything is there. i wanted to simply install nano and still can&#039;t get a straight answer. some say its there, some say its not. i can&#039;t seem to find it. anyways, ill try and wrap this up quickly. i&#039;ve downloaded a few images that were posted marked as builds 45222, 45250, etc but every time i try and flash the router i ended up back on 45204. again, any recommendations would be greatly appreciated. i tend to be the type that once its working, leave it alone. and thats sorta what I&#039;m after here minus making actual network changes. thanks in advance.</p>									</div>
