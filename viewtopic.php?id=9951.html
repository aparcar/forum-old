					<p>Hi all, i&#039;m trying to add some custom packages. For custom package i mean that i have a tarball with source files and i want to compile it and then get an ipkg to install in my openwrt kamikaze, that i have installed on a MT RouterBoard.</p><p>Which is the best way to get there? I knew that i must use SDK. The manual (wiki) is really confused, and i am too. I&#039;ve tried to compile it too, inserting it in the trunk structure, inserting a Makefile in the package directory. Nothing! i get compiling errors, because it try to locate a lnx dir under my sources. </p><p>Waiting a response.... thanks<br />Bye</p>									</div>

					<p>You don&#039;t need to start with the SDK, you can also start with the OpenWrt sources; the difference is mostly that the sources will build the compiler while the SDK already comes with the compiler. It&#039;s actually easier to use the sources, it just takes a little longer.</p><p>As for the package makefile, the real trick is understanding just how much OpenWrt&#039;s buildroot system does for you. This is not your traditional makefile, the goal is not to describe how each piece of the source is run through the compiler, and what optimization flags are used; there&#039;s already a makefile included with the source that does all that. All that you need to do is tell OpenWrt where to download the sources and a brief description of what they are for the ipkg entry. The actual compile is done by passing control over to whatever structure already exists within the source.</p><p>Compiling a typical linux application from source generally looks like this:</p><p>1. Extract the sources into a temporary directory.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - is the source a tar.bz2? tar jxvf source.tar.bz2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - is the source a tar.gz? tar zxvf source.tar.gz</p><p>2. Configure the source<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - if the source has a &quot;configure&quot; script, run it: ./configure</p><p>3. Compile the source<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - make</p><p>OpenWrt knows this pattern, you don&#039;t need to specify it. Hence the package Makefile can be simplified down to the following:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>include $(TOPDIR)/rules.mk

					<p>Thanks for this useful example Makefile! For my project i need to install a cross layer interface (xian). I&#039;ve tried to modify your example to insert it, also if it was different because it was not a &quot;normal&quot; package, instead it does not have a bin ad some data, it has some libs and 2 kernel module.<br />So i only added shell code to install right files in the right places. The problem is that my package does not appear in the menuconfig! now i&#039;m trying adding a line in the .config... i will see...<br />if i have some kernel modules i have to write down in the Makefile the lines like $(call Autoload.... etc?&nbsp; &nbsp;because i found them in another Makefile...</p>									</div>
