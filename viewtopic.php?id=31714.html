					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a TL-WR1043ND doing:</p><p>*tinyproxy + iptables working as&nbsp; a&nbsp; interception proxy<br />*openvpn with openssl<br />*vlans<br />*snmp<br />*Wifi with WPA Enterprise</p><p>Doing all of that it works quite well</p><p>I&#039;d like to install DansGuardian but there is no enough space. And I fear that has an adverse effect on its performance.</p><p>I am considering to buy a second TL-WR1043ND and install DansGuardian on it.</p><p>I wonder if there is anyone using tinyproxy + DansGuardian in production. I&#039;d want to use them on a TL-WR1043ND. Think that there will be around a maximum of 30 users at once....<br />Also I need that tinyproxy keeps on working as a interception proxy (aka transparent proxy, this is a must for me)</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>

					<p>What you describe should work and fit on a TL-WR1043ND (although I&#039;m a little worried about the OpenVPN requirement - what about a WNDR3700 or one of the Buffalo devices?).</p><p>However, on any of these devices you&#039;re not going to have a good time running DansGuardian with 30 concurrent users. Your users will certainly see some slowdown if you&#039;re on a reasonably fast connection. For a handful of users you&#039;ll be okay, but 30 is quite a lot. I would suggest using something more powerful if you really need to proxy all of this traffic.</p><p>Would be interested in other people&#039;s opinions on this too.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Sam</p>									</div>
