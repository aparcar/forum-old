					<p>The warning goes away on the next run after you once have run &quot;./scripts/feeds install -a&quot;. (Removing the error may require you to delete the tmp directory, so that all package data gets created again. I did that.)</p><p>mariadb package now offers that libmysqlclient feature, and mariadb got installed right after those warnings. No warnings next time.</p>									</div>
