					<p>Hi!</p><p>I have a TP-LInk TL-WR841ND v10.0 router an use Chaos Chalmers 15.05.1. Because I needed to convert some of the leds to switches/buttons, I patched the OpenWRT sources. Everything works fine, except for that I am unsure how to exactly reproduce the prebuild images offered at your wiki (sorry, no link as not allowed [for new users?]).</p><p>My build-process so far<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>git clone -b chaos_calmer git://github.com/openwrt/openwrt.git<br />cd openwrt<br />[... do the patching ...]<br />./scripts/feeds update -a<br />./scripts/feeds install -a -p luci<br />make menuconfig<br />[ ... select target, select &quot;LuCI&quot; to be build in (star) ]<br />make</p></blockquote></div><p>Still, I feel unsure if thats all, as my modification can only add up to some bytes and I still do not match the filesize closely (approx. 60kB off).</p><p>I can not find any list how to exactly reproduce the prebuild images...</p><p>Thank you developers very much for your effort. I have seen a lot of build systems for embedded plattforms, yours really worked very nicely out of the box!</p><p>Best regards<br />Robert</p>									</div>
