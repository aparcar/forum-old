					<p>I&#039;ve got my WNDR3700v1 up and running on trunk ar71 r25398, telnet worked, ssh setup. Logged in via luci and started adding kmods for usb storage. I&#039;ve got a 7 port powered USB hub attached with 3 4GB flash drives. I&#039;ve assigned them mount points via block UUIDs, but on a reboot they aren&#039;t remounted. They&#039;re all still present after the reboot and I can mount, fsck them or swapon to any of the partitions as needed. The only odd message in dmesg has to do with swap signature not being found. Any ideas what might be stopping them from automounting?</p>									</div>
