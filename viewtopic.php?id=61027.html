					<p>I have a bunch of questions:</p><p>I installed all usb audio ac97 and alsa packages And my VIA based USB audio adapter works.<br />It records with <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>arecord -vv test.wav</code></pre></div><p>and <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>aplay test.wav</code></pre></div><p>does play it back</p><p>However with a few glitches...&nbsp; <br />Ii think it is a bit to heavy on the cpu how do i verify this?&nbsp; What else can i do to make it record more smooth?</p><p>Then how do i stream it with ices.<br />The ices manual says<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ices /etc/ices.xml</code></pre></div><p>&nbsp; but that file does not exist, is that supposed to be created manually? </p><p>What should i expect performance wise? What bitrates should be possible on MT6720 and AR9331 SoCs?</p><p>And where do i find the audio input?&nbsp; <br />Is there a way to visualise the mic signal?</p><p>When I do<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cat test.wav</code></pre></div><p>then i can see the data that was recorded into that file</p><p>Is there a way to see a live audio signal in a similar&nbsp; way? </p><p>Most usb audio project only cover mp3 playback but on audio capture and streaming on OpenWrt the info is a bit more limited. </p><p>The VIA USB audio adapter has a LED, when I plug this device into a Ubuntu machine the LED lights up, However in the OpenWrt device the LED stays OFF.&nbsp; What is it that controls a LED on a USB device?</p><p>When I hotplug the VIA USB audio device then the MT7620 (NEXX) reboots, the AR9331 (AR150) seems to be fine with it.&nbsp; When i use a USB hub on the MT7620 then the MT7620 does not reboot. <br />Is this a MT7620 bug,or a hardware issue?&nbsp; It&#039;s not a real problem just an annoyance that i happened to notice. <br />Though if it is a bug then i will report it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>frietpan</strong> on 20 Nov 2015, 00:31)</p>

					<p>If you want the best perfomance you should use as format the same raw pcm format that it use your usb audio card internally, I think there is a aplay option to see this hardware format.</p><p>My usb audio card only has one format, 48khz sampling rate and 16 bits depth, the play or record of any other format requires conversion by software (resampling audio can be a hard work for the cpu of a router).<br />The usb driver is very simple, it sends USB_ISOCHRONOUS packets with the samples in that audio pcm format.</p><p>My usb audio card is a cheap one, a blue &quot;3d sound&quot; usb dongle.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks KAHN85,</p><p>Lets see if I understood that,&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Staying in the default samplerate means no&nbsp; resampling is necessary and that saves on CPU load?<br />So i can then get full samplerate data that&#039;s nice, For recording this would be OK. Though if i want to stream the data (Using ICES) then the high samplerate will be an issue, Since it then needs to be encoded into OGG.<br />I&#039;m still learning how to configure ICES, i have not figured it out yet.&nbsp; And i don&#039;t know how much load it will be on a tiny MT7620 SoC.&nbsp; I expect a few obstacles here.&nbsp; </p><p>What i would like to achieve is a stable audio stream but at a bitrate that the MT7620 can handle.<br />And i try to figure out if there are options to reduce the cpuload. </p><p>The USB card i use is also a cheap audio dongle.&nbsp; The chip is a VIA VT1620 and the specs in the datasheet surprised me, The thing is capable of doing 24bit / 192khz. <br /><a href="http://www.viatech.com/en/silicon/legacy/audio/vt1620a/">http://www.viatech.com/en/silicon/legacy/audio/vt1620a/</a><br /><a href="http://www.datasheet4u.com/datasheet-pdf/VIA/VT1620A/pdf.php?id=918331">http://www.datasheet4u.com/datasheet-pd â€¦ ?id=918331</a><br />44.1khz seems to be the lowest supported bitrate</p><p>So it looks like using ices to encode it to OGG is a lot to ask for.</p><p>In aplay i can indeed find playback parameters <br />in arecord however i would expect record parameters, but in arecord i get a list of the same playback parameters... </p><p>If i understand the datasheet correct then the VT1620 only spits out RAW PCM data and i dont see if it is possible to reduce the samplerate to 22khz on the chip itself.&nbsp; I have a few other SUB sound cards so i will also have a look at those soon.</p><p>It&#039;s not yet clear to me if OGG encoding is a viable option or not.&nbsp; A mono stream @ low bitrate would be good enough.&nbsp; </p><p>However these devices are capable of streaming webcams so i hope for the best for streaming audio.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, software resampling is a intensive activity for a small router cpu.</p><p>Audio encoding is a cpu intensive activity too.</p><p>If the kind of audio you want to record is human voice you can use another audio codec like &quot;speex&quot;.</p><p>Also, consider that one thing is chip specs and another thing is driver implementation.</p><p>You can view the data through usb with &quot;usbmon&quot; kernel module and tcpdump (network sniffer than it can be used to sniff usb too).<br />And you can code your own user-space driver implementation using libusb or usbfs directly.</p>									</div>

					<p>The VIA chip also seems to have VOIP capabillities not clear yet what that means, i can&#039;t imagine that there is a compression codec in there, though that would be cool in this case. <br />Coding my own driver..., I don&#039;t have the coding skills to do this yet, i&#039;m slowly learning the capabillities and limits of audio on these devices, so maybe in the future i can have a look at some more advanced stuff.</p>									</div>
