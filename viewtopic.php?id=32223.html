					<p>Hi,</p><p>I bought a cheap DIR-825 that was sold &quot;spares or repair&quot; and without antennas or power supply and am hoping to recover it.</p><p>It&#039;s B2 hardware.</p><p>It&#039;s labelled 12V 2A and I only had 12v 1A or 5v 2A power supplies so I used a 12v 2A car power supply to test but observed the same results when trying the 5v 2A mains adapter.</p><p>Anyway, on initially powering up, all I could get out of it was the blue DLink logo lighting up - no other lights, even when plugging a laptop into the ethernet ports.</p><p>However, straight after removing the case lid, I plugged it back in and got an orange power light, then the internet light, then it booted up and I could successfully plug in the laptop, get a dhcp lease and connect to the web interface on 192.168.0.1.</p><p>I could also successfully connect to the wireless and get a dhcp lease.</p><p>I was just trying to work out why the 5Ghz radio wasn&#039;t working (couldn&#039;t see the SSID on either an iPhone or Macbook Pro), even after turning off the 2.4Ghz in the options when the car power cut out (it&#039;s on a timer when the engine isn&#039;t running).</p><p>Since then, I can only get either just the blue Dlink logo light, or if I unplug and twist/move the case a bit and plug back in, I can sometimes get a constant orange power light but nothing else seems to happen.</p><p>I tried powering on while holding down the reset button for a while which several places seems to say initiates a firmware recovery mode, but the power light stayed orange.</p><p>I was wondering whether there was anyone with technical experience of these units could offer some thoughts on:</p><p>- Thoughts on why I only get a blue logo and then if I twist/fiddle with the unit I can then get an orange light or more? - think it&#039;s a faulty pcb and movement is causing it to work?</p><p>- What is a solid orange power led showing?</p><p>- Any tips on recovery, given that there was life and successful operation of it for a few minutes?</p><p>- Can you successfully run these on 5v 2A or 12v 1A?</p><p>- Less important now, but any idea why the 5Ghz radio wasn&#039;t working? - the 2.4Ghz was and both the 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz led&#039;s were on....</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Ian</p>									</div>
