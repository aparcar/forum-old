					<p>I saw an answer to this <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Freeswitch has a great driver that lets you make VOICE CALLS through unlocked dongles. I haven&#039;t done it myself but they answer your question.</p><p><a href="https://freeswitch.org/confluence/display/FREESWITCH/mod_gsmopen">https://freeswitch.org/confluence/displ â€¦ od_gsmopen</a><br />They seem to plug a commercial site for unlocking the dongle, but they do have a list of recommended models to buy that can be unlocked - hopefully a free way <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> That&#039;s what you should start with.</p><p>Oh sorry I got mixed up.</p><p>You really should be trying trunk if you are trying to work with new hardware.
