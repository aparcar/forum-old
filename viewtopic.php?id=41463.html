					<p>Hi All</p><p>I&#039;ve installed altitude adjustment on tplink wr703n with ruby and the gems but I cant install the serialport gem.<br />I saw that for some reason it is still not supported and I would like to ask if there are any plans to implement it.<br />I&#039;ve also tried searching on how can I build this on my own but without any success, keep in mind that im a newbie.<br />If there is anyone that has a guide/documentation/weebsite with a good explanation can you share it with me here.<br />If any of you has tried and successfully comunicated on serial port with the help of other langugaes please share how as well <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />The whole point of this is that I can send command to a 3G dongle to recieve and send SMSs and based on their contents to do different things.<br />Thanks</p>									</div>
