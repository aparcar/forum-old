					<p>I was testing 8.09 from November til last week on AR71xx and IXP4xx boards (Mikrotik RB433AH and Sparklan WAPD-170AG) each with 1 miniPCI Atheros card in it. It was working great. Madwifi, quagga, ssh, and nothing else. Worked like a charm, 7.5 MB/s throughput on SuperA link, everything I need.</p><p>After that I bought more miniPCI cards and tried to run more links on it, but I have problems...</p><p>1 link is working perfectly. Still having 7.5MB/s over it. Same on both boards, the first link works like on my old routers.<br />The second link is working, but the signal level is cca 9dBm lower than before (Debian based PC with a Trendnet PCI ABG wireless card). But, the other side of the link receives the OpenWRT&#039;s wireless card with 16-18 dBm lower signal than before. </p><p>The same problem apears on both RBs (different archs, both Kamikaze 8.09), with different cards (Mikrotik R52 and some miniPCI from e-bay with the same chipset as R52). I also tried to switch links, but then I get the same problem, but switched. The link that had -58dBm at both end gets -66dBm at OpenWRT and -75dBm at the other end (Debian PC router).<br />The link is still up, but I cant get more than cca 500 KB/s over it. That throughput matches the signal level and Link Quality displayed on the Debian box (Signal -75, LQ 20).</p><p>Any ideas whats going on? What to try next?</p>									</div>
