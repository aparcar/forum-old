					<p>I may have had a sloppy firewall configuration, and I may have served DNS requests from the Internet.<br />Now that I both reject and log any incoming UDP/53 traffic I see quite many requests (from Internet IPv4 hosts).</p><p>A few questions...</p><p>If I leave my DNS &quot;open&quot;, can it be used for bad stuff (such as forwarding DNS requests to perform a DDOS attack)?</p><p>I am experimenting with IPv6 using 6to4. It works fine.<br />Does that have anything to do with that I should expect/serve incoming DNS requests (over IPv4)?</p><p>I am using Barrier Breaker and I believe I have not changed the default DNS settings.</p>									</div>
