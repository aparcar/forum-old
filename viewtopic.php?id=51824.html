					<p>I&#039;m not sure how many people would be interested in this but I managed to build a working version of Barrier Breaker for the MR16 and it seems stable, so far. It&#039;s just the generic Atheros AR71xx with USB support taken out as well as modified boot args to suite the flash layout of the MR16. This is the first time I&#039;ve ever compiled OpenWrt so I may have made a mistake or 2 but in the end it works and does what I need it to do.</p><p><a href="http://monoprice.comisyourfriend.com/MR16-OpenWRT_r41824.zip">Here&#039;s</a> a link to both the kernel and the squashfs filesystem.</p><p>I have only figured out how to flash it by using serial and flashing via uBoot. There is a file in the zip that contains what to do in uBoot to flash it as well as set the bootcmd to make it boot.</p><p>Hopefully this helps someone out who wants to flash something better than what is currently on their MR16. I ended up doing this because my MR16 kept on dropping clients and would stop passing data for certain clients. So far with OpenWrt it seems stable with those problematic clients.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>parker955</strong> on 25 Jul 2014, 09:40)</p>

					<p>I can so this with a Meraki that I know nothing about, and is claimed by some other account on the Meraki dashboard, right?

					<p>For the easy, minimal path, here&#039;s what I&#039;ve done on a couple of our APs to run the latest final release build successfully:</p><ul><li><p>Get TFTP server and serial connection working, of course</p></li><li><p>Download kernel.bin and rootfs-squashfs.bin for the correct device from the latest build (as of today at <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05/ar71xx/generic/)">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal … /generic/)</a></p></li><li><p>Put those two files in your TFTP root</p></li><li><p>Boot the AP with serial connection active, keep pressing a key quickly until it drops to &lt;ar71xx&gt; prompt</p></li><li><p>Copy/paste the flashing commands into your serial session <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/meraki/mr16">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/meraki/mr16</a></p></li><li><p>After it finishes and reboots into OpenWRT, change root password with &#039;passwd&#039;</p></li><li><p>Done.&nbsp; LuCi web interface is available to configure device.</p></li></ul><p>This information is available in a few different places but I thought I would put it all right in this thread since it shows up high in the Google search results for anyone else looking to get OpenWRT running on their Meraki MR16.&nbsp; This is the USB adapter I used <a href="http://www.readytoflyquads.com/cp2102-usb-adapter">http://www.readytoflyquads.com/cp2102-usb-adapter</a></p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve got my Meraki MR16 here and my serial UART device here and wired up.&nbsp; I&#039;m sitting at UBOOT, however, I can&#039;t get my TFTP server to see the AP.&nbsp; I followed the instructions on the MR16 and TFTP OpenWRT wiki pages.&nbsp; I used the command:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>setenv ipaddr 10.0.0.170
setenv serverip 10.0.0.90</code></pre></div><p>I can successfully ping the TFTP server from the AP:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ar7100&gt; ping 10.0.0.90

Using eth0 device
host 10.0.0.90 is alive
