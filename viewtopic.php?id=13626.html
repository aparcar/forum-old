					<p>Hi - I get the same problem as you describe it seems as thought the boot_dev NVRAM setting does not survive a power off.&nbsp; Did you get any clues as to what s causing this and how to resolve it?&nbsp; I&#039;m concerned about power out whilst I&#039;m remote from my box and not being able to get it back up again without physically connecting.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Ian</p>									</div>
