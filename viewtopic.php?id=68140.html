					<p>Hi All,</p><p>I am new to OpenWrt so please excuse any lack of knowledge/understanding. I have spent a couple of days searching the net getting my head around the environment and following various tutorials, but I have got to the point where I am stuck and I&#039;m wondering if I&#039;m on the right track. So it would be appreciated if anyone is able to point me in the right direction.</p><p>My goal is to set up a single device in a remote location to act as if it is physically connected to my office network, and for this device to be assigned/set up with a static IP address on my office network. I have bought a GL-iNet 6416 router and a USB 3G Dongle for this purpose.</p><p>So far I have successfully set up the router to access the internet through the USB dongle and I have also set up a VPN tunnel through this connection using L2TP. My router has been assigned an IP address by my office D-Link DFL-800 firewall and I can ping it from any computer in my office. The next step is for my remote device connected physically via ethernet to my GL-iNet router to be assigned an address and for it to be accessible from my office which is where I have gotten stuck.</p><p>The firewall was already set up to accept VPN connections and assigns IP addresses to VPN clients from a pool. These addresses are what are being assigned to the router. I also have a DHCP server set up running on Windows Server 2008 R2. </p><p>I only need to access the one device in the remote location, so I would be happy if the IP address that was assigned to the GL-iNet router was actually assigned to my device. But ideally all devices I connect to the router would be assigned addresses by my office DHCP server.</p><p>Router Model: GL-iNet 6416A v1<br />Firmware Version: OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05 / LuCI 15.05-54-gfd60055 Release<br />Kernel Version 3.18.27</p><p>USB Dongle: Huawei E3351<br />Setup using Tethering Option (eth2)</p><p>Thanks in Advance,<br />Justin</p>									</div>
