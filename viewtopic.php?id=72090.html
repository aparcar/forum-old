					<p>Turn off the DHCP servers (both V4 and V6) in the AP&#039;s.&nbsp; When someone connects to any of the AP&#039;s, they need to get their DHCP response from the main router, so it will tell them correctly that the main router is the gateway to the Internet.</p><p>In a &quot;dumb AP&quot; scenario, roaming is controlled by the client.&nbsp; When it loses signal from the one it is connected to, it should search for another.&nbsp; The APs should have the same SSID and encryption, but on different channels.&nbsp; Different channels are not essential for operation but it is better when possible, so the APs and users interfere with each other less.</p><p>WDS is useful when there are wireless &quot;backhaul&quot; links from APs to the main router.&nbsp; You have Ethernet cables instead so you don&#039;t need WDS.</p><p>A guest network should be established in the main router then distributed to the APs by VLANs on the Ethernet cables.</p><p>The IPs you give the APs themselves are only so you can log in and administrate them.&nbsp; They are not important for network user functionality.&nbsp; You don&#039;t have to and should not give your APs an IP on the guest network.</p>									</div>

( main router then distributed to the APs by VLANs on the Ethernet cables.)<br />-wifi: if i walk from AP1 to AP2 the connection gets lost short while switching from AP1 to AP2. &gt;Is there a way to avoid this ? roaming ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>schlaubi666</strong> on 17 Sep 2017, 21:09)</p>
